He was an active member of the Khayelitsha health forum and was branch secretary for the Democratic Alliance. Having applied for asylum in Ireland in 2017, Mfaco was placed in Direct Provision centres, first in Dublin, later in County Clare and County Limerick. Based on his experiences within this system, he joined the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland (MASI) and now acts as their spokesperson. He has spoken out about the issues faced by members of the LGBT community within Direct Provision, as well as the sub- standard living conditions in many centres across Ireland, describing them as \\"ghettos in every sense of the word\\". He has described how victims of sexual assault are particularly vulnerable within Direct Provision, and that the way in which people are housed can leave people open to further attacks, particularly those in the LGBT community. He has written reports and documented life within the system, strongly advocating for it to be abolished. Despite holding a permit to work, Mfaco has only secured one hour of paid work since 2018, he claims due to Irish employers not understanding the permit given to asylum seekers. In 2019, Mfaco successfully appealed to the Press Council of Ireland in upholding a complaint against The Irish Times for their publication of a racial slur. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Mfaco has spoken out about how living conditions within Direct Provision centres make social distancing or self-isolation impossible due to over-crowding and shared facilities.

Early life  R. W. Goodman was born on August 23, 1915 in Richmond County, North Carolina, United States to Maggie Wallace Goodman and John Lawrence Goodman. R. W. lived in a rented textile mill company house with 15 siblings. His father worked in the company's mill in Cordova and as a barber. After his father died, R. W. dropped out of high school and took up work in the mill and making deliveries for a dry-cleaner. Goodman then briefly served in the United States Navy before being discharged in 1937. The following year he married Alice Smith, a woman who lived in the same mill village. He had four children with her.  Career  In 1938 Goodman began working at the E.B. Morse Store in Rockingham, across the street from the Richmond County Courthouse. He bought a portion of the building in 1941, and then purchased the rest of it three years later, renaming it R. W. Goodman Company. Under Goodman, the store acted as a full service retailer and mostly sold clothing and furniture. He bought nearby buildings over the following years for use as offices and showrooms. Over time he gained enough wealth to move his family into a prominent Rockingham neighborhood and acquired Richmond Yarns Inc., a textile mill that employed over 200 people. In 1946 Goodman campaigned to become Sheriff of Richmond County. He lost the May 25 Democratic primary election, earning 2,281 votes to the leading candidate's 2,931 votes. He succeeded in gaining the post four years later with the electoral support of local mill workers. As sheriff, Goodman was the boss of a conservative Democratic courthouse machine in Richmond County. He held wide influence in determining who served in local government and represented the county in the North Carolina General Assembly and maintained a wide network of informants. He oversaw the machine from his furniture store, where he spent most of his time. He rarely stayed in his official office, and management of the sheriff's department was usually performed by his chief deputy, who reported to him several times a day, though he would go to investigate large crime scenes and perform high-profile arrests. Sheriff's deputies would stop by his store to update him on law enforcement matters, as would local constituents who wanted his help or wished to discuss politics with him. If he saw a politician or journalist walking by with whom he wished to speak, he would send a store clerk out to fetch them. Beginning in the 1960s, local politicians would stop by his store in election years to ask for his endorsement. Goodman used his connections with local representatives to lobby the state government in Raleigh; in one instance he successfully secured state funding for a new water system on behalf of Hamlet municipal officials. Goodman allegedly garnered electoral support by being lenient with minor offenders with the implicit expectation that they voted for him and his preferred candidates in a subsequent election. Unlike other politicians in the American South during his tenure, Goodman courted black support and hired a few black sheriff's deputies. Most local black citizens considered him \\"fair and impartial\\" when dealing with matters related to race. Beginning in the 1970s, he supported some black candidates for public office. While serving as sheriff Goodman became wealthy, and some locals attributed this to allegations that he collected kickbacks from real estate transactions he managed and other financial dealings. Some locals also accused him of illegally selling moonshine the sheriff's department had seized. Goodman was also staunchly opposed to labor unions and allegedly harassed union organizers and pressured rival corporations with the goal of keeping wages depressed in Richmond County so as to guarantee larger profits from his own enterprises. Goodman served as a delegate at the 1960 Democratic National Convention. He served as a member of the North Carolina Economic Development Board from 1977 to 1984. He retired from the office of sheriff in 1994 after serving in the post for 44 years, setting the record for the longest tenure of a sheriff in North Carolina.  Later life and legacy  In 1983 the U.S. Route 74 bridge over the Pee Dee River was renamed in Goodman's honor. Goodman underwent open-heart surgery late in his tenure as sheriff. In 1989 the Richmond County Chamber of Commerce awarded him its \\"Citizen of the Year\\" honor. In 1994 the North Carolina Senate passed a resolution honoring Goodman for his long tenure as Sheriff of Richmond County. Goodman's wife died in 2001. Goodman died on April 5, 2007 at his home in Rockingham and was buried two days later. Journalist Rob Christensen wrote that Goodman was \\"the last of the 'high sheriffs'\\" of North Carolina. His son, Ken, later served in the North Carolina House of Representatives. Ken also managed the R. W. Goodman Company store until it closed in 2013.

Katy Perry et. al. was a copyright infringement lawsuit against Katy Perry, Jordan Houston (\\"Juicy J\\"), Lukasz Gottwald (\\"Dr. Luke\\"), Karl Martin Sandberg (\\"Max Martin\\"), Henry Russell Walter (\\"Cirkut\\"), Capitol Records and others, in which the plaintiffs Marcus Gray (\\"Flame\\"), Emanuel Lambert (\\"Da' T.R.U.T.H.\\") and Chike Ojukwu alleged that Perry's song \\"Dark Horse\\" infringed their exclusive rights in their song \\"Joyful Noise\\" pursuant to 17 U.S.C § 106.. The focus of the similarity was a short descending pattern known in music as an \\"ostinato\\".Gray v. Perry, No. 2:15-cv-05642 (C.D. Cal.), Wais Declaration in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, Exhibit 3 Expert Report of Todd Decker (April 6, 2017) In both songs, a short ostinato is used repeatedly to form part of the beat of each song and both ostinatos share similar descending shapes. Gray et. al. claimed that the instrumental beat of the ostinato in \\"Joyful Noise\\" was protectable original expression and that Perry et. al. had access to and copied the ostinato when composing \\"Dark Horse.\\" On March 16, 2020, Judge Christina A. Snyder ultimately found that Gray et. al. had failed to satisfy the extrinsic test for substantial similarity, overturning a previous jury verdict which had sided with the plaintiffs.  Background  Joyful Noise was released in 2008 as a part of the album ‘Our World: Redeemed’ which debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard Top Gospel Chart in 2008 and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock or Rap Gospel Album. Joyful Noise was extensively played on Christian Radio, and was nominated for the 40th GMA Dove Awards. The track itself peaked at Position 9 on the US Billboard 200 in 2011, following which, its music video versions were released garnering more than 4 million views at the time of the suit and around 10 million till date. In September 2013, Capitol Records released the Dark Horse song as a promotional single from Perry's album, entitled ‘Prism’. By January 2014, it had reached Number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, where it remained for weeks. In both songs, a short ostinato is used repeatedly to form part of the ‘beat’ of each song and both ostinatos share the same descending shape, though the ostinato of Joyful Noise uses three notes, while that of Dark Horse uses four. The defendants alleged that public distribution of CDs of Prism, duplication and uploading of digital versions of defendants’ song on websites for purchase, as well as public performance of the song at various concerts and events by the plaintiff violated their copyright in Joyful Noise. In addition, Capitol Records prepared the music video of defendants’ song and arranged for its commercial syndication and publication on YouTube and other commercial sites. The defendants emphasized that unauthorized copying, distribution, and public performance of Joyful Noise caused them damage and irreparable harm, and requested permanent injunctive relief since the defendants failed to cease infringing activities despite notice of infringement.Gray v. Perry, No. 2:15 CV-05642 CAS JC (W.D. Mo.), Complaint (July 1, 2014) They also asserted reputational harm for Joyful Noise being falsely associated with anti-Christian witchcraft, paganism, black magic, and Illuminati imagery evoked by the Dark Horse song. Apart from equitable relief, the defendants sought monetary damages, defendant's profits, interest, costs and reasonable attorney's fees, and requested a jury trial.  Summary judgment  In August 2018, Justice Christina A. Snyder from the United States District Court for the Central District of California denied the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, finding existence of genuine issues of material facts as to questions of defendant's access to the plaintiff's song, and substantial similarity between the Dark Horse and Joyful Noise.  Access  The defendants asserted that there was a high burden to show widespread dissemination and popularity, which had not been met. In response, the plaintiffs pointed to evidence showing that prior to the creation of Dark Horse, videos of Joyful Noise had amassed nearly four million online views on YouTube and MySpace, and enjoyed popularity and acclaim in the Christian music industry.Gray v. Perry, No. 2:15-cv-05642 (C.D. Cal.), Memorandum in Opposition to Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment (July 16, 2018) The writers of Dark Horse said they never viewed Joyful Noise, nor had they heard of the plaintiffs previously. The defendants averred lack of commercial success,Loomis v. Cornish, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 162607, at *41 (C.D. Cal. November 13, 2013), affirmed, and urged the court to discount the importance of online views on mentioned platforms since they don't show the actual number of unique human views.Gray v. Perry, No. 2:15-cv-05642 (C.D. Cal.), Defendant's Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment (June 25, 2018). The court disagreed with the defendants, holding that the plaintiffs only needed to show a reasonable possibility of access to the protected work for showing a genuine issue for trial,. and found such possibility to exist due to widespread dissemination of Joyful Noise. While the court agreed that mere posting of a video on online platforms was insufficient to show access, it sided with the plaintiffs, reasoning that, although the plaintiffs had not shown evidence of commercial success, they had demonstrated a triable issue of fact as to access because Joyful Noise achieved critical success, including a Grammy nomination, and was readily available and viewed millions of times on YouTube and MySpace. The court likewise rejected the argument pertaining to unsatisfactory rebuttal of the defendants’ evidence of independent creation, noting that “the strength of defendants’ evidence for independent creation is a factual issue for the jury to determine at trial, and is not an issue suited for determination at [the summary judgment] stage.”  Substantial similarity  The court mentioned that for the purposes of summary judgment, only the extrinsic test was important because the subjective question of intrinsic similarity must be left to the jury. The Plaintiff’s submitted, through their musicologist Todd Decker, that the songs shared \\"five or six points of similarity\\"; specifically, the ostinatos , which were either identical in both songs, or nearly similar in their phrase length, rhythm, pitch content, and timbre. The defendants attempted to convince the judge otherwise through the report of their own expert, arguing that the two songs shared no significant similarities beyond generic elements. They argued that commonplace elements are not copyrightable to begin with because they are part of the inventory of fundamental musical ideas.Gray v. Perry, No. 2:15-cv-05642 (C.D. Cal.), Wais Declaration in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, Exhibit 4 Expert Report of Lawrence Ferrera (May 5, 2017) Perry's musicologist, Lawrence Ferrera, exhibited over thirty songs composed prior to Joyful Noise which shared similar elements with both songs. Some of these included much older songs ;Mary Had a Little Lamb', \\"'Jolly Old St. Nicholas', and 'Merrily We Roll Along'. Ferrera also argued for a more holistic comparison of the songs’ elements, not just the ostinatos themselves. Todd Decker rebutted by stating that the examples were gross generalizations about the use of ostinato, and he continued to draw arguments to plain audible similarities of the common ostinato in both songs.Gray v. Perry, Wais Declaration in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, Exhibit 8 Response of Todd Dekker to Expert Report of Lawrence Ferrara (June 9, 2017). Acknowledging that certain elements plaintiffs’ expert relied upon to support substantial similarity may be individually unprotectable, the court reasoned that Decker's expert testimony involved identification of particular features, which in combination, could support a jury's finding of substantial similarity. The court, unconvinced by defendant's criticisms of Decker, relating to transcription of musical elements of the songs and abstraction of unprotectible elements of Joyful Noise prior to comparison, found a genuine issue of material fact as to substantial similarity between the two songs.  Jury trial  On July 29, 2019, a nine-person federal jury, consisting of six women and three men, found that Perry, Dr. Luke, Max Martin, Cirkut, Sarah Hudson, who only wrote the lyrics, and Juicy J, who only wrote the rap, were guilty of infringement, along with Capitol Records, Warner Bros. Music Publishing, Kobalt Publishing, and Kasz Money Inc. The defendants had testified that they had never heard Joyful Noise, or of the plaintiffs, before the lawsuit. The plaintiffs responded that the song was widely distributed, with millions of plays on YouTube and Spotify, and reminded the jury that Perry, herself began her career from the Christian Music World. Jurors agreed, finding that the song was distributed widely enough that there was a reasonable chance that the Dark Horse writers had heard it. Plaintiffs argued that there was substantial similarity between the songs since Perry and her team had copied the main beat and instrumental line of Joyful Noise and the same featured in a substantial part of Dark Horse. Perry's attorney, Christine Lepera said during closing arguments of the trial that, “they’re trying to own basic building blocks of music, the alphabet of music that should be available to everyone.” The jury disagreed, finding that the bumping beat and riff at the heart of Joyful Noise were original enough to be copyrighted, handing the victory over to the plaintiffs. Upon jury's finding of infringement, the plaintiffs asked for damages amounting to $20 million contending that Dark Horse was responsible for $31 million coming in to Capitol Records, counting all profits from album and live DVD on which it appeared. Capitol Records disputed that accounting for costs, their profits from the song itself, were only $650,000 and the defense lawyers argued that $360,000 was a reasonable figure for damages. The jury found that 22.5 percent of the profits from Dark Horse were attributable to parts of Joyful Noise.Gray v. Perry, No. 2:15-cv-05642 (C.D. Cal.), Special Jury Verdict (August 1, 2019) On August 1, the jury decided that awarded the plaintiffs $2.78 million in damages, of which Perry herself was ordered to pay $550,00.  Motion for judgment as a matter of law  In October 2019, the defendants filed an appeal against the jury verdict calling the decision “a grave miscarriage of justice”. Defendants' contentions Perry et. al., moved for judgment as a matter of law asserting that there was no sufficient evidentiary basis supporting either the jury's findings on substantial similarity between the two songs, or defendant's access to Joyful Noise’since no direct and circumstantial evidence was presented, the dissemination was in a niche market, and defendants did not avail the opportunity to access Joyful Noise.Gray v. Perry, No. 2:15-cv-05642 (C.D. Cal.), Defendants’ Notice of Motion and Motion For Judgment as a Matter Of Law or, alternatively, for A New Trial (October 9, 2019) They also challenged the jury's decision on unrebutted and unimpeached evidence at trial demonstrating independent creation of Dark Horse. They further questioned the evidentiary basis for the opinion that the Ojukwu's instrumental beat was itself copyrighted remarking that Joyful Noise was a derivative work of that beat and not a work of joint authorship. The defendants finally challenged the jury's finding that 22.5 percent of the net profit earned from Dark Horse was attributable to the use of the Joyful Noise and the exclusion of costs in calculating profits.Gray v. Perry, No. 2:15-cv-05642 (C.D. Cal.), Memorandum in Support of Defendants’ Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or, alternatively, for a New Trial (October 9, 2019) In the alternative, the defendants requested for a new trial citing the same reasons and asserting that award was excessive and contrary to the clear weight of the evidence. The motion for a new trial highlighted that Plaintiffs’ counsel and witnesses, Dr. Todd Decker, engaged in misconduct by perversely influencing the jury though his improper and highly prejudicial testimony. Plaintiffs' contentions The plaintiffs argued that proper application of the extrinsic test to the facts and evidence submitted must reasonably lead to a clear finding of substantial similarity emphasizing that the Ninth Circuit accords protection to a wide range of musical elements taken alone or in combination.United States v. Hamilton, The plaintiffs referred to Swirsky to highlight that, “it cannot be said as a matter of law that seven notes is too short a length to garner copyright protection.” The multiple similarities between the songs were not commonplace and Dr. Decker identified several other shared elements which, in combination, contribute to the distinctiveness of the ostinatos. Gray et. al., finally submitted that the apportionment determination was fully supported by the evidence, and rather, the evidence actually demonstrated that the damages awarded were insufficient as the jury should not have deducted nearly $5 million in “royalty expenses” in calculating Capitol's profits.Gray v. Perry, No. 2:15-cv-05642 (C.D. Cal.), Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants’ Post-Trial Motions (November 20, 2019) The plaintiffs disputed the motion based on lack of sufficient ground for a new trial since the clear weight of the evidence fully supported the jury's findings on liability. They made reference to Rule 59 and the remittitur standard reiterating that the court has the discretion to grant a new trial “if the verdict appears ... to be against the weight of the evidence,” . and only if of the firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. Further, there was no misconduct since Dr. Decker's testimony was proper and did not influence the jury on matters of striking similarity as the opinions were on matters exclusively related to the intrinsic test. Additionally, a group of musicologists submitted an amicus brief supporting the defendant's motion on January 9, 2020.Gray v. Perry, No. 2:15-cv-05642 (C.D. Cal.), Amicus Curiae Brief filed by Amici Curiae Musicologists (January 9, 2020)  District Court judgement  The plaintiff had only asserted copying by trying to show access and substantial similarity. The District court employed the two-part test of extrinsic similarity and intrinsic similarity to is determined substantial similarity.  Extrinsic test  Protectability of elements = Justice Snyder remarked that the uncontroverted evidence pointed to only one conclusion: that none of the individual elements, as set forth by plaintiff's own musicologist, constituted individually protectable elements. * First, the key or scale in which a melody is composed is not protectable as a matter of law. Neither are evenly- syncopated rhythms, pitch sequences or chord progressions, protectable as such. * Second, as conceded by Gray et. al., the rhythm or phrase length of eight notes were not independently protectable musical elements. * Third, because an ostinato is a “basic musical device”, and its use is in accordance with rules of consonance common in popular music, it is not the type of musical element that is protectable. * Fourth, assuming that the timbre or texture, were a product of the composition, they were still not protectable being inherent elements of music, and more attributable to the sound recording. Finally, the court opined that the musical elements of the ostinato in Joyful Noise were not “numerous enough and arranged in a sufficiently original manner to warrant copyright protection.” Thus, Justice Snyder held that neither the individual nor combination of elements in the plaintiff's ostinato were protectable under the extrinsic test. = Substantial similarity = Perry's lawyers had referred to the Ninth Circuit's influential en banc opinion in favor of Led Zeppelin, as part of their appeal to Judge Snyder. The court, ruling on whether Zeppelin's song \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" violated the copyright of the song \\"Taurus\\" by the band Spirit, had found that in case of “works where there is a narrow range of available creative choices”, the protection available was thin and only towards works ‘virtually identical’ to that of the plaintiff's. Following the Ninth Circuit's reasoning, Justice Snyder said that the plaintiff's claim was based on minimally original musical expression that acquires only “thin” protection. Noting that elements in the Dark Horse ostinato needed to be “virtually identical” to the “Joyful Noise” ostinato in order to meet the “substantially similar” standard, the court referred to Dr. Decker's testimony. * First, the testimony set forth that the pitches on the seventh and eighth beats of the Joyful Noise ostinato were different from the pitches on the corresponding beats of the Dark Horse ostinato in Joyful Noise. * Second, ignoring Dr. Decker's opinion, the court found considered at least six instances of portamento in the composition in Joyful Noise not present in “‘Dark Horse’ as a significant factor. * Third, Dr. Decker himself acknowledged that the compositions for the ostinatos use different keys, tempos, harmonies, and rhythms.Gray v. Perry, No. 2:15-cv-05642 (C.D. Cal.), Trial Tr. at 505:9-22 at 460:5-25, 462:1-6, 504:11-22. The court concluded that, even if the 8-note ostinato in Joyful Noise was protected, the evidence submitted did not support a legal conclusion that the two ostinatos were, objectively, substantially similar, lest being “virtually identical.”  Intrinsic tests  Access = The court pointed out that the question was not of “proven access based on preponderance of evidence but whether reasonable minds could find that defendants had a reasonable opportunity to have heard Plaintiff’s song before they created their own song.” Justice Snyder believed that the question must be deferred to jury’s determination of reasonableness and held that the evidence presented by plaintiffs at trial was sufficient to support the jury’s finding as to access, although the court might have found otherwise. = Substantial similarity = The court also considered substantial similarity pursuant to the intrinsic test, examining whether an ordinary, reasonable person would consider the total concept and feel of Joyful Noise and Dark Horse to be substantially similar. Despite the plaintiff’s ostinato failing the extrinsic test, the court refused to resolve the intrinsic test as a matter of law, and held that “a reasonable jury could nevertheless conclude that the ‘concept and feel’ of the two ostinatos were ‘intrinsically’ similar.”  Other defenses  Despite granting defendants judgment as a matter of law, the court also entertained defendants’ other arguments and affirmative defenses, but rejected them all. = Independent creation = Defendants had proffered extensive testimony about independent creation the ostinato in Dark Horse. The court said that the jury was entitled to credit or discredit this self-interested testimony as it saw fit, and once the jury decided that the testimony was not credible enough to establish “proof of independent creation,” the Court must, yield to that determination.. = Failure to establish ownership of a joint work = The defendants had contended that Joyful Noise was a derivative work since the ostinato in it was originally part of a beat published earlier by Chike Ojukwu.Gray v. Perry, No. 2:15-cv-05642 (C.D. Cal.), Trial Tr. at 183:17-184:1, 118:19-119:3, 194:19-22, 356:6-8. They argued that plaintiffs’ copyright does not extend to protect the preexisting material embodied in the beat. Plaintiffs rebutted arguing that Joyful Noise was a joint work of authorship since, and that Ojukwu retained a 50% ownership stake in the song created with his beat.Gray v. Perry, No. 2:15-cv-05642 (C.D. Cal.), Trial Tr. at 184:7-22, 186:6-25, 195:9-197:4 The district court held that evidence presented showing that Ojukwu and Gray contracted to become coauthors of Joyful Noise, was dispositive and established plaintiffs’ ownership as a matter of law, and defendants were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this basis. = Liability for individual defendants = The defendants had also contended that the evidence presented did not support a finding that any defendants other than Walter (“Cirkut”) and Capitol Records were individually liable for the alleged infringement of Joyful Noise. Reiterating the opinion of the Ninth Circuit that, “in copyright infringement cases, any member of the distribution chain of allegedly infringing products can be jointly and severally liable for the alleged misconduct”, Justice Snyder, said that each of the defendants named could be liable for infringement based on their role in the “distribution chain”. = Failure to apportion = The Defendants had contend that the jury’s finding of 22.5 percent of net profit derived from Dark Horse being attributable to the use of plaintiff’s ostinato reflected “pure speculation unsupported by evidence”. Evidence established that the infringing ostinato in Dark Horse plays across 45% of the composition, based on which plaintiffs requested 45% of defendants’ aggregated profits, of which the jury evidently decided to divide plaintiffs’ requested amount in half based on evidence presented. Justice Snyder commented that the jury’s damages award was not so clearly unsupported by substantial evidence as to warrant vacatur, and an award of “less than 100% of the profits but more than the percentage estimates of [defendant’s] experts does not represent clear error.” = Failure to deduct overhead = To determine the defendants’ net profits, the Court instructed the jury to “deduct all appropriate expenses incurred by that defendant from that defendant’s gross revenue.”Gray v. Perry, No. 2:15-cv-05642 (C.D. Cal.), Jury Instructions (Phase II) (Given) by Judge Christina A. Snyder (July 31, 2019) Appropriate expenses include “fixed overhead” costs, provided that the overhead “contributed” to the infringing good. Capitol Records presented testimony that its deductible expenses amounted to $11,772,912, including $5,103,213 in overhead costs while plaintiffs sought to discredit this overhead figure suggesting that did not “contribute” to the production, marketing, or commercial success of Dark Horse.Gray v. Perry, No. 2:15-cv-05642 (C.D. Cal.), Trial Tr. at 1431:15-1435:11 Weighing the evidence, the jury deducted only $6,669,699 of the $11,772,912 in claimed expenses from the total claimed profits, declining to deduct the $5,103,213, and the jury’s decision is supported by substantial evidence adduced at trial, and not otherwise contrary to law.  Conclusion  The Court granted the defendants’ motion for judgment as a matter of law and vacated the jury’s verdicts as to liability and damages since Gray et. al, failed to satisfy the extrinsic test for substantial similarity. The court held that a new trial would have been allowed, as the jury disregarded the weight of the evidence, highlighting that it was Katy Perry’s star power and Capitol’s marketing efforts, and not the similarity to plaintiffs’ ostinato, that made Dark Horse a commercial success. However, since the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law, defendants’ motion for a new trial was denied as moot. Adam Neely, a jazz musician in New York, highlighted the dangerous precedent of allowing exclusive rights over building blocks of musical compositions. Since the verdict on 'Blurred Lines' there was an emergence of lawsuits focusing on commonplace musical elements in combination; and the decisions in Zeppelin and Perry et. al., have been received as a move in the right direction by many litigators and musicians. Christine Lepera, the lawyer for Katy Perry said that the chilling effect created by \\"the ‘Blurred Lines’ curse\\" in the music industry had been lifted with this verdict. With the defendant's attorneys vowing to doing their best to restore jury's verdict on appeal, Marcus Gray, filed a notice of appeal at the Ninth Circuit on April 13, 2020.

The 'delightful'Richard Abel (ed) Encyclopedia of Early Cinema, Routledge (2005) - Google Books p. 613 film was made by the Clarendon Film Company founded by Stow and Henry Vassal Lawley. It was written by Langford Reed and was the second screen adaptation of Shakespeare's The Tempest, the first being when Charles Urban filmed the opening storm sequence of Herbert Beerbohm Tree's stage version at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1905 for a -minute flicker. Stow's film can be said to be the first cinematic version designed specifically for film and in its 12 minute length manages to convey some of the magic of Shakespeare's play.Trevor R. Griffiths, The Tempest, Palgrave Macmillan (2007) - Google Books p. 127 Synopsis Ariel frightens Caliban in The Tempest (1908) Prospero watched by Miranda and Caliban casts his spell Prospero summons a tempest to sink Duke Antonio's ship Three sailors on a ship lower a young Miranda to Prospero in a small boat, while one hands a book to Prospero. The two land on an enchanted island where Prospero carries Miranda and the book through a rocky landscape. On discovering the savage Caliban eating grass Prospero pulls his sword and subjugates him at sword point. The fairy spirit Ariel is discovered trapped in a hollow tree and is released by Prospero before skipping around the tree. Ten years pass and Miranda is grown to womanhood. While she is sitting Caliban sneaks up behind her and clutches his heart to show his devotion. While Miranda spurns his advances Ariel appears and points at Caliban before turning into a monkey - and then turns back to himself and chases Caliban off. Prospero and Miranda are studying the mysterious book in a cave while Caliban looks on. Prospero puts a liquid and some powder into a small cauldron following which there is an explosion and doves fly out. Through an opening in the cave Prospero and Miranda see a ship in the distance. Prospero uses his powers to create a tempest that makes its mast fall down and it sinks, shipwrecking those who caused his exile. Ferdinand survives the shipwreck; he walks from the sea on to a beach before wandering around the countryside. Ariel is sent to him and leads him on, while disappearing and reappearing. When Ferdinand sees Miranda the two instantly fall in love. When Prospero appears he is angry and Ferdinand draws his sword which disappears and reappears in Ariel's hand, who promptly disappears again. Miranda pleads with her father but is sent away. Prospero draws Ferdinand away to a pile of logs, where he leaves him. Miranda arrives and helps Ferdinand move a large log after which Prospero reappears and gives the two his blessing. Elsewhere the shipwrecked Antonio and his courtiers lie collapsed on the ground suffering pangs of hunger before Ariel appears and uses his powers to produce a feast - which promptly disappears. With the arrival of Prospero the men kneel before him and plead for forgiveness. Ferdinand and Miranda arrive with Ariel. Antonio is pleased to see his son, who introduces Miranda. Ariel is released from Prospero's service following which Prospero, Ferdinand, Miranda and Caliban are waiting on the beach when a boat arrives. Antonio and his men arrive and all present board the boat apart from Caliban, who is roughly pushed away. Production The British Film Institute describes Stow's The Tempest as \\"Comfortably the most visually imaginative and cinematically adventurous silent British Shakespeare film\\". Unlike William Kennedy Dickson's 1899 film version of King John and Charles Urban's 1905 film of The Tempest, both of which were simply films of Herbert Beerbohm Tree's stage productions, Stow's film was a condensed version of the entire play set specifically for the camera and tells the backstory (the film's first four scenes are set before the play starts) of how Prospero arrived on the island, his first encounter with Caliban and the discovery of Ariel.Lisa Hopkins, Screen Adaptations: The Tempest: A Close Study of the Relationship Between Text and Film, Bloomsbury (2008) - Google Books pp. 37-38 Characters such as Duke Antonio are only sketched in while others such as Stephano and Trinculo do not appear at all and Percy Stow may have presumed that his audience would be familiar enough with the story to not require additional detail. The Tempest was filmed in the studio and on location.Grace Tiffany, The Tempest: Evans Shakespeare Edition, Wadsworth Learning (2012) - Google Books p. 65 Running at 12 minutes long,The Tempest (1908) - Century Film Project intertitles are used to link the short scenes but do not use Shakespeare's own prose. Several elaborate scenes were filmed in the studio which drew on Percy Stow's trick-photography expertise, including where Prospero summons up the tempest, which the BFI describes as being reminiscent of the work of the French film pioneer Georges Méliès. The scene where Ariel disappears and reappears while being chased by Ferdinand was achieved by simply using a jump cut - stopping filming and the actress moving in and out of shot. The scene is comic and emphasises the playful nature of Ariel but is also an effect that could not be replicated on stage giving the film an advantage over the theatre in what Judith Buchanan called an 'ambiguity of styles'. The film is included in the British Film Institute (BFI) DVD compilation Silent Shakespeare, with an optional commentary by Judith Buchanan.The Tempest (1908) - British Film Institute database The cast is now unknown.The Tempest (1908): Movies From The Silent Era - Back to the Past ReferencesExternal links *The Tempest (1908) - Internet Movie Database Category:1908 films Category:1900s fantasy films Category:British black-and-white films Category:British films Category:British silent short films Category:Films directed by Percy Stow Category:British fantasy films Category:Films based on The Tempest ","title":"The Tempest (1908 film)"},{"id":"64332073","text":"Nigel Cochrane (born 12 November 1961) is a Canadian sailor.

Incident Carson had been staying at a motel, the Knights Inn, for several days. In the early afternoon of June 6, Carson was walking across the motel's parking lot with a cup of coffee, when, without warning, he was assaulted with a chemical weapon and then shot to death by private security guard Christopher Straight, according to surveillance video. Two bullets struck Carson, including at least one in his head. Straight, 53 years old at the time, was taken into custody later that day by the Tulsa Police Department, and on June 10 he was charged by the Tulsa County prosecutor with first-degree manslaughter. Before his employment as a private security guard, Straight had worked in law enforcement for 16 years, and had been the subject of multiple accusations of misconduct, including race- and gender-based bigotry. The day before the shooting incident, in the midst of national protests in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, Straight had endorsed a statement on social media saying “How about all lives matter. Not black lives, not white lives. Get over yourself no one’s life is more important than the next. Put your race card away and grow up.” Six days prior, on May 31, Straight had published a statement on social media “If you are anti-police: I’m blue family, unfriend me,” along with the hashtag \\"#Bluelivesmatter\\". Biography Carson was 36 years old at the time of his death, and had three children. He had previously been convicted of and imprisoned for non-violent criminal behavior including burglary, false personation and entering with intent to steal copper, and subsequently had been released from prison. At the time of his death, he had been struggling with mental health, and had engaged mental health services to try and turn his life around. His brother Ananias Carson described him as a family man who enjoyed fishing. Reactions Ananias Carson, a police officer in the Tulsa Police Department, criticized the circumstances of his brother's death. “We’re not trying to paint him [Carlos Carson] out to be an angel or saint. But no one needs to be assaulted, then shot, because they defended themselves. My brother didn't deserve what he got, especially in the manner that it happened. He didn’t deserve that.\\" Ananias Carson further bemoaned that Straight had destroyed Carlos Carson's shot at redemption and “taken away his chance to do anything with his children.\\"  See also  * Black Lives Matter References Category:African-American history of Oklahoma Category:African- American history in Tulsa, Oklahoma Category:African-American-related controversies Category:Law enforcement controversies in the United States Category:Police brutality in the United States Category:Post–Civil Rights Era African-American history Category:Race-related controversies in the United States Category:1980s births Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:2020 deaths Category:2020 controversies in the United States Category:2020 in Oklahoma Category:Black Lives Matter Category:Deaths by firearm in Oklahoma Category:Deaths by person in the United States Category:June 2020 events in the United States ","title":"Shooting of Carlos Carson"},{"id":"64332190","text":"Anna Mitchell Davenport Raines (April 8, 1853 – January 21, 1915) was an American philanthropist and founding Vice President of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. She later served as the organization's Honorary President General and as the Custodian of the Southern Cross of Honor.  Biography =Early years Raines was born Anna Mitchell Davenport on April 8, 1853 in Isle of Hope, Georgia, near Savannah, to Major Hugh McCall Davenport, a Confederate Army officer, and Martha Anne Elizabeth Stone. As a child during the American Civil War, she brought bandages and food to Confederate hospitals and military camps in Savannah. In 1864 Union Army General William Tecumseh Sherman ordered all Confederate officers' families out of Savannah during his March to the Sea, and Raines and her family took refuge in Augusta and, later, Atlanta. When Robert E. Lee surrendered, the family was in Macon. After her father returned from the war, the family stayed in Savannah and then moved to New York. On February 11, 1873 Raines married Lucian Hamilton Raines. They had five children: Martha Stone Raines, Richard Mitchell Raines, Lucian Hamilton Raines, Jr., Mary Judson Raines, and Davenport Raines. United Daughters of the Confederacy In 1892 Raines responded to a call from the Confederate Veterans' Association of Savannah for women of the city to form their own auxiliary organization. She was elected secretary of the Ladies Auxiliary. At a meeting in December 1893 Raines suggested that the auxiliary form into a permanent organization, and moved to change the name to Daughters of the Confederacy. The chapter was formed and Raines was elected as the first president. She was unaware that, at this time, another society bearing the name \\"Daughters of the Confederacy\\" had been organized by Caroline Meriwether Goodlett in Tennessee. Goodlett and Raines were made aware of each other's organizations and joined them together, extending invitations to similar women's societies in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri to create the National Association of the Daughters of the Confederacy. Raines was elected as the first vice president of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, with Nashville becoming the first chapter and Savannah becoming the second chapter. Raines submitted a constitution and bylaws, as well as a design for the organization's insignia. At the Second Annual Convention in Atlanta in 1895, the name of the organization was officially changed to the United Daughters of the Confederacy. She later served as the UDC's honorary president general and as the Custodian of the Southern Cross of Honor. She and Goodlett were known to have a staunch rivalry, and both considered themselves to be the original founder of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. Death Raines died on January 21, 1915 and was buried in the family plot in Laurel Grove Cemetery in Savannah.

Between 1863 and 1867, he was engaged in extensive cotton-growing in Mississippi and Louisiana. Dent was captured by the Confederates towards the end of the Civil War and spent about a month in custody. After Grant was elected president in 1868, Dent took up residence at the White House. Dent decided to run for governor of Mississippi on the National Union Republican Party ticket. He was supported by conservatives in both parties, and the Democratic party opted not to field a candidate but to support Dent.Garner 1901, p. 240 However, Grant did not support his brother-in-law, as he opposed his white supremacist views. Dent was defeated in his gubernatorial ambitions by the wealthy planter James L. Alcorn. After losing the election, Grant named him minister to Chile. At the end of his life, Dent became a Roman Catholic. He died in Washington, D.C. in 1873.

It has improved potency, low metabolism, and good pharmacokinetic properties relative to 2-methoxyestradiol (2-MeO-E2). It is also a potent inhibitor of steroid sulfatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the desulfation of steroids such as estrone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S). STX-140 exhibits anti-angiogenic activity and induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human tumor xenografts, with clinical potential for hormone–independent tumors. Some of this activity stems from tubulin binding at the colchicine site and disruption of interphase microtubules. STX-140 is highly active in tumors that are resistant to chemotherapy. In xenograft models of breast and prostate cancer complete cures were achieved after oral treatment with STX-140 and drug-resistant tumors also shrank in size after oral treatment. Conventional treatments for hormone- independent cancers targeting tubulin are associated with side effects, such as neurotoxicity, and can only be given infrequently and intravenously. STX-140 is more effective on the same tumors, blocks metastatic spread without the peripheral neuropathy associated with current clinical anticancer drugs.

Robinson describing the process of deriving social and economic value from another person of a different racial identity, predominantly used to insinuate the derivation of value from those of a nonwhite (person of color) identity; however, a person of any race might engage in racial capitalism, as might an institution dominated by one particular race. The elementary thesis of the concept is: Capitalism as an economic system subsists on the perpetual accumulation of capital and an increasing rate of said accumulation, and capital \\"can only accumulate by producing and moving through relations of severe inequality among human groups.\\" Therefore, for capitalism to survive, it must exploit and prey upon the \\"unequal differentiation of human value.\\" And in both 17th-century and contemporary society, the predominant differentiator was and is skin color and ethnicity. In Robinson's own words: \\"the development, organization, and expansion of capitalist society pursued essentially racial directions,\\" and \\"it could be expected that racialism would inevitably permeate the social structures emergent from capitalism.\\" The term was coined by Cedric J. Robinson in his book Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical Tradition, published in 1983. Robinson's articulations of racial capitalism were imperative in the emerging field of Black and diasporic African studies, wherein new lines were drawn between capitalism, racial identity, and the development of the disconnected social consciousness—the disjunction or discontinuity of interhuman relations—in the 20th-century. Building upon earlier examinations of racial discrimination in and inherent to various political ideologies and societal structures, Robinson challenged the Marxist notion of capitalism's negation of the basic discriminatory tenets of European feudalism, namely its rigid caste system and reliance upon multi-generational serfdom. Rather than considering capitalism as revolutionary and radically liberating, as, say, Michael Novak does, he argued for the inverse: capitalism did not liberate those in racially oppressive positions, nor did it reject feudal principles; in other words, capitalism bred a new world order, one that extended—not deconstructed—feudalism's ethical faults, and one that developed and became intertwined with various forms of racial oppression: \\"slavery, violence, imperialism, and genocide.\\" In 1983, Robinson writes: > What concerns us is that we understand that racialism and its permutations > persisted, rooted not in a particular era but in the civilization itself. > And though our era might seem a particularly fitting one for depositing the > origins of racism, that judgment merely reflects how resistant the idea is > to examination and how powerful and natural its specifications have become. > Our confusions, however, are not unique. As an enduring principle of > European social order, the effects of racialism were bound to appear in the > social expression of every strata of every European society no matter the > structures upon which they were formed. None was immune. Further, Robinson theorized that all capitalism was inherently racial capitalism, and racialism can be exhibited in all layers of capitalism's socioeconomic stratification. And although racial capitalism is not limited to European territories or those previously under Europe's colonial or imperial rule, it was from western European's 17th-century dominion that the two, capitalism and racial exploitation, were first conflated. Thus, racial capitalism, according to Robinson, emanated from the \\"tendency of European civilization...not to homogenize [groups of peoples] but to differentiate\\"—differentiation that led to racial hierarchization and, as a result, exploitation, expropriation, and expatriation.  History = 1600s  The fusion of race and capitalism first materialized with the advent of the African Slave Trade, in the late 17th-century. Though slavery existed for thousands of years prior to the conquest of the Americas and the commodification of the African man—for instance: classical Greek and Roman Supply chains were heavily reliant upon slave labor—racism and its convergence with capital as is understood today emerged concurrently with the 1600s' oceanic trade routes. The transatlantic voyage of the English to the New World, unlike the conquests of the Spanish crown, which yielded significant deposits of gold, silver, and other final metals, was subsidized primarily through diligent and systematic agricultural businesses. From its inception, cash crop agriculture was serviced chiefly by white indentured servants, and it was not until the sixties and seventies that servitude was formally institutionalized into slavery. The indentured servants, mostly indebted or imprisoned English and Irish immigrants, worked under a plantation owner for a set period of time, usually for four to seven years, before obtaining 'free man' status. As plantations expanded and workloads surged, and as indentured servitude terms expired, white American colonists yearned for more sustainable means of economical, unrestricted employment to meet growing demand and ever- increasing profit quotas. In 1661 the Barbados Slave Code was signed into law, serving as a basis for the Caribbean (Barbados, specifically) slave trade. On paper the legislation protected both the slave and the slave master from heinous cruelty; however, in effect, only the latter party received lawful security. Further, owners were provided with various methods to keep slaves in-line, and by law were proffered legal intervention if slaves pursued retaliation or a collective insurrection. It's important to note: During this time, citizens of color lived amongst the colonies, some of which even enjoyed state-protected freedom. On one account, the Chesapeake Bay, in the early to mid 1600s, was described as having a multiracial character: > There is persuasive evidence dating from the 1620s through the 1680s that > there were those of European descent in the Chesapeake who were prepared to > identify and cooperate with people of African descent. These affinities were > forged in the world of plantation work. On many plantations Europeans and > West Africans labored side by side in the tobacco fields, performing exactly > the same types and amounts of work; they lived and ate together in shared > housing; they socialized together; and sometimes they slept together.  20th century  Charisse Burden-Stelly, Assistant Professor of Africana Studies and Political Science at Carleton College in Minnesota, argues in a recent article for the socialist Monthly Review that \\"modern U.S. racial capitalism [emphasis in the original] [is] a racially hierarchical political economy constituting war and militarism, imperialist accumulation, expropriation by domination, and labor superexploitation ... [it] is rooted in the imbrication of anti-Blackness and antiradicalism. Anti-Blackness describes the reduction of Blackness to a category of abjection and subjection through narrations of absolute biological or cultural difference; ruling-class monopolization of political power; negative and derogatory mass media propaganda; the ascent of discriminatory legislation that maintains and reinscribes inequality, not least various modes of segregation; and social relations in which distrust and antipathy toward those racialized as Black is normalized and in which 'interracial mass behavior involving violence assumes a continuously potential danger' ... Antiradicalism can be understood as the physical and discursive repression and condemnation of anticapitalist and/or left-leaning ideas, politics, practices, and modes of organizing that are construed as subversive, seditious, and otherwise threatening to capitalist society. These include, but are not limited to, internationalism, anti- imperialism, anticolonialism, peace activism, and antisexism.\\" Burden-Stelly uses the work of Trinidadian-born sociologist Oliver Cromwell Cox to argue that \\"[m]odern US racial capitalism arose in the context of the First World War, when, as Cox explains, the United States took advantage of the conflict to capture the markets of South America, Asia, and Africa for its 'over- expanded capacity.'\\" Burden-Stelly notes that (in the context of the First Red Scare) a 1919 US Justice Department report, Radicalism and Sedition Among the Negroes, As Reflected in Their Publications, condemned Blacks' \\"'ill-governed reaction toward race rioting,' 'threat of retaliatory measures in connection with lynching,' open demand for social equality, identification with the Industrial Workers of the World, and 'outspoken advocacy of the Bolshevik or Soviet doctrine.'\\" Burden-Stelly situates the critique of racial capitalism as developed by Cedric Robinson within an early- and mid-20th-century tradition of Black radical critique whose major practitioners included, among others, \\"W. E. B. Du Bois, James W. Ford, the Sojourners for Truth and Justice, Esther Cooper Jackson, Walter Rodney, and James Boggs.\\"  Critiques  Critics of racial capitalism repudiate the correlation between racialism, primarily in the form of slavery, and capitalism, on the grounds of slavery's misconstrued global chronology and historicity. The central argument is that racial oppression emerged centuries before modernity, and did so independent of capitalist society. Thomas Sowell, for example, in his book Black Education: Myths and Tragedies, published in 1974, argues that \\"[c]apitalism could not possibly be the cause of slavery because slavery preceded capitalism as the dominant social order in virtually all parts of the world.\\" According to Sowell, slavery in ancient civilizations predates the ideas and writings of capitalism's 18th-century forefathers, such as Adam Smith and his seminal text The Wealth of Nations. The origin of slavery and all forms of (un)systematic racial oppression reach back thousands of years to, e.g., Spartan and Athenian society. Plato, for instance, living in the 5th-century B.C., recognized and admitted institutional slavery into the Utopian state, Magnesia, described in his work Laws.Morrow, G. (1939). Plato and Greek Slavery. Mind, 48(190), 186–201. Retrieved 5 July 2020, from www.jstor.org/stable/2250858 And, two millennial later, in the Middle Ages, slaves played an integral part in imperial economies, and the role of the slave eventually evolved into that of the feudal serf. In its myriad forms, \\"[s]lavery was practiced without regard to race in Europe, Africa, and Asia, and by Native Americans in North and South America,\\" for thousands of years prior to capitalism's inception. For that reason, critics of racial capitalism argue that: Capitalism does not foster racial separation and oppression, rather it serves as an economic system, one of many over the years, that merely permits—not encouraging nor escalating—the propagation of racial biases and prejudices that naturally arise and afflict a given multiracial society. With particular regard to the United States, the Jim Crow laws—one of many state-sponsored instruments of American racial segregation—arose from the minds of ardent segregationists as an attempt to further exclude \\"African-Americans from mainstream political and economic life.\\" In this case, rather than capitalism in and of itself, historians accredit statist lobbies of post-Civil War society with the inauguration of the aforementioned racially-discriminatory legislation.C. Vann Woodward, The Strange Career of Jim Crow, 2d rev. ed. (London: Oxford University Press, 1966), 108. In fact, the principles of capitalism, particularly the law of supply and demand at work in labor markets, were, in effect, partially responsible for the integration of the African-American worker into the mainstream economy, owing to the employer's normative inclination to pursue the least-costly available form of productive labor. In The Declining Significance of Race, William Julius Wilson writes: > Indeed, the determination of industrialists to ignore racial norms of > exclusion and to hire black workers was one of the main reasons why the > industry-wide unions reversed their racial policies and actively recruited > black workers during the New Deal era. Prior to this period the overwhelming > majority of unskilled and semiskilled blacks were non-unionized and were > available as lower-paid labor or as strikebreakers.

By contrast with other discovery mechanisms, CIDs are typically issued before a complaint has been filed by the government in order to commence a lawsuit against the recipient of the CID. CIDs are considered a type of administrative subpoena.  Background  In civil litigation, the discovery process is intended to help clarify and narrow the issues in a case in advance of trial. Parties request documents from one another in order to gather evidence, determine if a case is viable, examine what issues should be explored further, and consider what arguments they might make in court. CIDs are unusual, as compared to civil procedure under ordinary discovery rules, for two reasons. First, they are issued before the relevant government agency has filed a complaint against the target of the demand. Ordinarily, a lawsuit must have commenced before one party can demand documents from the other party. Second, they are not reciprocal: the government can issue a CID to investigate a person before a complaint has been filed, but that person is not entitled to demand information from the government.  Legal authorization  A number of state and federal statutes authorize the issuance of CIDs.  Antitrust law  Federal antitrust law authorizes the Attorney General to issue a CID \\"[w]henever [he or she] has reason to believe\\" that a person has information \\"relevant to a civil antitrust investigation\\" or to an investigation under section 3 of the International Antitrust Enforcement Assistance Act of 1994. Texas antitrust law gives the Attorney General of Texas similar authority.  Dodd–Frank  The Dodd–Frank Act gives the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) authority to issue civil investigative demands. Richard Cordray, a former director of the CFPB, has described CIDs as a \\"crucial\\" tool for the CFPB's enforcement operations.Decision and Order on PHH Corporation's Petition to Modify or Set Aside Civil Investigative Demand, In re PHH Corporation, 2012-MISC-PHH Corp-0001, at 3.  Consumer protection law  State consumer protection laws known as Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices statutes, which prevent various kinds of unfair commercial behavior, often authorize state attorneys general to issue CIDs.  FARA  Since 1991, the National Security Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) has intermittently requested that the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) be amended to include the authority to issue CIDs under FARA. A number of proposed bills would grant DOJ this authority, but none had been passed.  FCA and state analogues  The False Claims Act (FCA) authorizes the Attorney General to issue CIDs requiring the recipient to produce documents relevant to an investigation under the FCA \\"[w]henever [he or she] has reason to believe that any person may be in possession, custody, or control of any documentary material or information relevant to a false claims law investigation.\\" A CID may only be served under the FCA before the Attorney General has brought an action against the target of the investigation, after which the statute requires the government to use more traditional discovery tools such as the subpoena. CIDs may be issued under the FCA at the initiative of the Attorney General or in relation to a qui tam action brought by a private relator. Courts have not imposed significant limits on the issuance of CIDs under the FCA, rendering their potential ambit quite expansive. One commentator has observed that it is \\"difficult[]\\" for a recipient to avoid complying with a CID under the FCA. , several state laws gave state attorneys general analogous powers to those under the FCA.  RICO  The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) authorizes CIDs. According to DOJ policy, they may be issued only with the consent of DOJ's Criminal Division.

It is also called Parco della Rimembranza (Italian for Park of Remembrance). The park occupies a roughly quadrangular cliff – which is in fact the north-west end of the Monti Parioli – looking steeply towards the Tiber in the area of Acqua Acetosa and overhanging the Olympic Village and the Parco della Musica. It can be accessed from Piazzale del Parco della Rimembranza and Via Maresciallo Pilsudski. History The fortified casale. Unlike the historic villas of Rome, Villa Glori was not born as a suburban villa, but as a rustic space intended for vineyards and hunting, so much so that the oldest building is a simple fortified farmhouse (casale), repeatedly remodeled and not even among the most beautiful of those scattered in the Roman Campagna A first idea of the park was born at the beginning of the 19th century, when a never realized Napoleonic project included it in a Passeggiata Flaminia – the prolongation along Via Flaminia of the urban space that Giuseppe Valadier had gloriously concluded in piazza del Popolo – on the model of those that were being created in the rest of EuropeAbout the Passeggiata Flaminia, see L'architettura nelle città italiane del XX secolo: dagli anni Venti agli anni Ottanta, edited by Vittorio Franchetti Pardo, Rome- Milan 2003, p. 139 and passim.. In the context of the campaign for the liberation of Rome of 1867, the area was the scene of the battle of Villa Glori, where the patriot Enrico Cairoli, among others, met his death. Cesare Pascarella immortalized the episode with a collection of 25 Sonnets entitled Villa Gloria, published in 1886, which is one of the very few examples of civil poetry in Romanesco dialect. Soon after the capture of Rome, the 1883 master plan already included the idea of a vast green space between the Parioli and Ponte Milvio and for this purpose the expropriations were started. At the time the hill had passed from the Boncompagni to the engineer Vincenzo Glori, to whom Pius IX had entrusted the construction of the new Ponte Mammolo; the villa was then named after the latter owner. An hippodrome for trotting races was built in 1908 in the plain under the cliff, in a location still very close to the historic center. The facility was operational until the end of 1950s, when it was replaced by the much larger Hippodrome of Tor di Valle, while on the site of the former hippodrome of Villa Glori the Olympic Village was builtThe memory of the former horse riding activities is now preserved only by the presence – in a corner of the area of the former racecourse – of a private horse-riding center, managed by Polisportiva S.S. Lazio.. In 1923 the villa, formerly owned by Glori, was turned into a public park to commemorate the fallen of the Great War and was called (as in many other Italian cities) Parco della RimembranzaToday the park is dedicated to the Roman fallen of all wars., though it also maintained the original name of Villa Glori. The design of the new park was entrusted to the architect Raffaele De Vico and consisted mainly in the realization of the central square and of a network of avenues, as well as the planting of over 6,000 trees and shrubs. The inauguration took place in 1924. In 1929 three pavilions dedicated to Ettore Marchiafava were built at the top of the hill, intended as a dispensary and summer colony for poor children at risk of tuberculosis. For the same purposes, a few years later a school was built next to it, alongside the old casale. In continuity with this sanitary tradition, since 1988 the former facilities, partially restored, have been entrusted to Roman Caritas, which has installed there a foster home housing AIDS patients.  Monuments and places of interest  The death of Enrico Cairoli by Carlo Ademollo (1868). Among the various monuments in the villa, worthy of mention areVilla Glori (Ville e Parchi): * The dried almond tree, near which Enrico Cairoli was killed; * The commemorative column of the fallen of 1867; * An oak grove commemorating the fallen during World War I; * A farmhouse used by the companions of the Cairoli brothers during the battle of Villa Glori.  Path of contemporary sculpture Varcare la Soglia  In 1997, at the suggestion of the art critic Daniela Fonti, the Municipality of Rome established a permanent exhibition of contemporary sculpture called Varcare la Soglia (\\"Crossing the threshold\\"), aimed at integrating nature and art. In 2000 the exhibition acquired two new works: Gate of the Sun by Giuseppe Uncini and Grass-man by Paolo Canevari. The exhibition also hosts works by Maria Dompè, Eliseo Mattiacci, Maurizio Mochetti, Nino Caruso, Pino Castagna, Jannis Kounellis, Nunzio and Mauro Staccioli.

Bettis plays Mandy, a drug-addicted nurse involved in a black market organ-trading scheme in 1999. Arquette was one of the film's producers, alongside his wife Christina Arquette, and Jordan Wayne Long, Tara Perry, and Matt Glass. The film also features music composed by Glass. 12 Hour Shift was scheduled to have its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2020 prior to the festival being postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film's distribution rights were acquired by Magnet Releasing in June 2020. Plot Mandy is a nurse with a drug addiction. In addition to stealing patient medications, she finances her drug habit by harvesting patient organs. Desk nurse Karen is Mandy's partner, and Mandy has recently brought on her cousin Regina to transport the organs to traficker Nicholas. One night Regina accidentally leaves a stolen kidney at the hospital, instead carrying a soda in the cooler to Nicholas. Irate, Nicholas demands Regina get the kidney or he will take hers. Regina cannot find the kidney at the hospital, and asks Mandy to help her. Mandy refuses, so Regina dresses like a nurse and kills one of Mandy's patients by pouring bleach down his throat. Regina expects that Mandy will be able to extract the dead man's kidney, but Mandy angrily explains that the patient was on dialysis, so his kidneys are useless. Regina threatens to tell the police about the organ traficking operation unless Mandy helps her. Mandy agrees and tells Regina to wait in her car. Outside, Regina sees one of Nicholas's henchman, and in a panic she kills a skateboarder and tries to take his kidney, but ends up taking his bladder. Meanwhile, inside the hospital Mandy kills a patient with an overdose and manages to harvest his kidney. She leaves the kidney in a cooler in the loading dock, but the kidney has disappeared by the time Regina gets to it. Nicholas's henchman, who has entered the hospital, prepares to drag Regina away, when she desperately suggests that they kidnap a comatose patient so that Nicholas can take all his organs. The comatose patient is Mandy's abusive, drug-addicted half-brother. Mandy intervenes, and together she and Regina manage to overcome the henchman. The police investigation (incorrectly) determines that the henchman had been committing the murders around the hospital. Regina leaves, and the exhausted Mandy takes a nap in her truck before beginning her next shift. The film ends with Mandy re-entering the hospital, followed shortly thereafter by Nicholas. CastRelease 12 Hour Shift was scheduled to have its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2020, but the festival was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2020, it was reported that the film's worldwide distribution rights were acquired by Magnet Releasing. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 6.98/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Sharp, twisted, and darkly funny, 12 Hour Shift is an uncommonly clever heist caper with a refreshing female-focused twist.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on 11 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Hoai-Tran Bui of /Film praised Bettis's performance, and wrote that the film \\"has a sick sense of humor that makes its washed-out setting the perfect blank canvas for writer and director Grant to paint her gleefully bloody caper.\\" Meagan Navarro of Bloody Disgusting also lauded Bettis's performance but criticized the film's characterization overall, concluding: \\"12 Hour Shift is far too ambitious for its own good, playing out like a blood-drenched yet unfocused comedy of frustrating errors.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:English- language films Category:American black comedy films Category:American comedy thriller films Category:American heist films Category:American films Category:Hospital films Category:Films set in 1999 Category:Films set in Arkansas Category:Films about organ trafficking Category:Films postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:2020 films Category:2020 black comedy films Category:2020 thriller films ","title":"12 Hour Shift"},{"id":"64332569","text":"Curt Roggow (born December 22, 1966) is an American politician who served in the Oklahoma House of Representatives from the 41st district from 1998 to 2006.

As deputy U.S. Attorney, Strauss assumed the acting position on June 20, 2020, after the previous U.S. attorney, Geoffrey Berman, stepped down amid pressure from Attorney General William Barr.  Early life and education  Strauss was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She is the daughter of Russian immigrants. She has one brother, a retired NASA doctor. Her parents died when she was young, after which she and her brother were raised by family friends.

Career  After graduating from law school, she clerked for then-U.S. District Judge Lawrence Pierce. From 1976 to 1983, Strauss served as an Assistant United States Attorney at the Southern District of New York. During her time there she served on the staff of the independent counsel investigating the Iran–Contra affair.

Kress Collection in the National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. It was painted in Italy circa 1590 when Carracci and his brother and cousin were pioneering the creation of naturalistic landscape works in which the countryside was depicted for its own sake, rather than as a stylised backdrop to a religious or mythological subject. It can be compared in this respect with his earlier paintings Fishing and Hunting, now both in the Louvre. The painting would have been created in the studio from sketches made in the field. Characteristically of Carracci's landscapes a dark foreground frames the distant view, the perspective enhanced by trees of diminishing height. The painting was acquired by the English art connoisseur John Rushout, 2nd Baron Northwick and displayed in his private gallery at Thirlestaine House near Cheltenham, England. When the collection was sold on his death in 1859 River Landscape was described as a work of Velazquez and only many years later was it ascribed to Carracci. It was bought in 1948 by its present owners, the Samuel H. Kress Foundation of New York and in recent years has been restored by the removal of discoloured varnish and the retouching of abraded paint.

William Thomas Hughes escaped from custody whilst being transferred from prison to court where he was facing charges of rape and grievous bodily harm. He stabbed two prison officers during his escape and then took five members of a local family hostage, only one of whom survived. Hughes was shot dead by police marksmen after a high-speed, multiple-vehicle pursuit; he was the first person to be shot dead by Derbyshire Constabulary and the first prison escapee to be shot dead in the United Kingdom in modern times..  Background =William Hughes William Thomas Hughes (born 8 August 1946, Preston, Lancashire) was the first of six children born to Thomas Hughes and his wife Mary. He had little interest in his education, his academic performance was poor and he was prone to antisocial behaviour and petty criminality from a young age. He failed to hold down a job for any lasting duration after leaving school at age 15. Hughes' escalating criminal behaviour resulted in spells in approved school and Borstal; he received the first of multiple prison sentences in 1966... left Hughes was married with one child, the relationship was beset with abuse, violence and infidelity.. In March 1976, he left his wife and moved to Chesterfield with his girlfriend where, on the night of 21 August 1976, he beat a man with a brick and raped the man's partner after meeting them in a local nightclub. Following a public appeal, the police were tipped-off and Hughes was duly arrested, charged and remanded to HMP Leicester. Despite his history of violent behaviour, Hughes was allocated work in the prison kitchen,. from where, on 3 December 1976, he stole a boning knife which he managed to keep concealed despite subsequent searches.. It later transpired, during the official Prison Service inquiry, that the police had given HMP Leicester minimal information about Hughes and Prison Service Headquarters had not furnished them with a comprehensive record of his previous convictions or his prior custodial history. As such, the department responsible for categorizing prisoners designated him as category B. The Mintons and the Morans Arthur Minton (born circa 1904, Solihull) and his wife Amy (née Aubrey; born 1909, Solihull) were married in June 1931, they had two children, Barbara and Gillian. They ran a grocery shop in School Lane, Acocks Green until Arthur's retirement; after selling the business they relocated to Derbyshire, sharing a home with their youngest daughter Gillian and her husband, Richard. Richard Moran (born 19 May 1935, Kilmoganny, Ireland) left school at the age of 14 and started his working life as a labourer. He served a stint in the Irish Army before moving to Birmingham. He initially worked in a factory whilst studying in the evenings, later securing a role as a sales clerk with a local building company. Gillian Moran (née Minton, born 24 March 1938, Birmingham) grew up in Acocks Green, upon leaving school she enrolled in secretarial college before going on to work as a typist and delivery driver. It was through this role that, in June 1958, she met Richard. They were married on 21 September 1959 and in 1966 they completed their family by adopting a baby girl, who they named Sarah (born 20 September 1966). Northend Farm was a converted 18th Century pottery barn on the edge of the Peak District National Park in Eastmoor. The Morans and Mintons moved into the property in October 1969, converting it into two living units and renaming it \\"Pottery Cottage\\". At the time their paths crossed with William Hughes, Richard was a Sales Director for a plastics manufacturer, Gillian worked as a Secretary for a firm of Accountants, Sarah was excelling at the local primary school and the Mintons were retired.. 12 January 1977=Escape Hughes was scheduled to appear at court in Chesterfield; it wasn't the first time he'd been transferred to court, he'd made the same journey on four occasions since being remanded into custody, he was described as giving \\"no cause for concern\\" by his previous escorts. On 12 January, the weather conditions were bad, heavy snow had fallen and traffic flow along the 55-mile route was disrupted. Hughes would be transported by taxi accompanied by Prison officers Don Sprintall and Ken Simmonds; he was frisked, handcuffed to Simmonds and placed in the back seat of the taxicab, with Sprintall sitting in the front passenger seat.. Before reaching the court Hughes insisted that he needed to use the bathroom, he used the opportunity to retrieve the stolen boning knife he had hidden on his person. Shortly after the journey restarted he attacked Sprintall, stabbing him in the back of the neck, before turning his attention to Simmonds. After incapacitating his guards he had the taxi driver drive on for a short distance before dumping him and the badly injured officers at the roadside. Hughes drove on for only a short distance before crashing the car into a wall along the B5057 and fleeing on foot onto Beeley Moor. Beeley to Eastmoor Initial stages of the police search Police were notified of Hughes' escape at around 10 am and within 25 minutes had located the crashed taxi Hughes had been travelling in. The immediate search was led by Chief inspector Peter Howse. At the scene, the police dogs were unable to pick up a scent, the snow had covered any footprints and there were no witnesses as the roads were deserted. A search radius was established to cover isolated properties, farms and outbuildings. Initial available resources were insufficient to thoroughly search every property in the area, so the focus was on the most vulnerable, 256 of which were checked in the first few hours. It was considered likely that Hughes would continue towards Beeley and would aim for the A6 and unlikely that he would have headed onto the open moors in such treacherous conditions. Hughes did exactly that, making his way over four miles of exposed moorland, heading north until he reached Baslow Road, Eastmoor. Pottery Cottage The Mintons were at home at Pottery Cottage when Hughes walked in through the back door armed with two axes he'd found in their shed. He told them that he was on the run from the Police and needed to lay low until nightfall, he assured them that he wouldn't hurt them. Gillian Moran was the first to arrive home, followed by her ten-yeear old daughter Sarah. Gillian told Sarah that Hughes was a stranded motorist waiting for his car to be repaired. The adults made small talk over coffee and Sarah sat on the floor sewing, before going through to the annexe with her grandfather to watch the television. In a subsequent witness statement Gillian described a calm and almost domesticated scene, noting that: \\"Up to this time, (Hughes) manner was friendly\\", but he became more agitated as the time passed waiting for Richard to return.. Richard arrived home just after 6 pm to find Hughes holding a knife to Gillian's throat, threatening to kill her if anyone approached him. He forced Richard to the floor and bound his hands and legs, he tied up Gillian next and then Amy. Amy's distress drew Arthur and Sarah from the annexe, both angrily castigated Hughes; he went to tie Arthur up next and when he resisted he was roughly manhandled, dragged across the floor and tied up in an armchair. Despite his earlier assurances, Hughes then gagged the adults, isolated them in separate rooms and took Sarah through to the annexe.. Gillian Moran spent the first night bound and gagged in her marital bedroom, she heard the sounds of a disturbance coming from the lounge below and realized it was her father being beaten. Hughes then made tea for his hostages, he held the cup for Gillian while she drank and then sexually assaulted her, he spent the rest of the night chatting to her husband in the next room, \\"as if he'd met him in a pub\\". 13 January 1977=Ongoing police search Overnight the Peak District saw the heaviest snowfall in more than 50 years, many roads were cut off and blizzard conditions hampered the ground search; two Army helicopters deployed to assist were soon grounded. The search remained focused on the area between the crashed vehicle and the A6 road, house-to-house checks were conducted in villages within the search radius, such as Beeley and Rowsley. A search team also worked along the east side of the A619, reaching the Highwayman Inn on Baslow Road; Pottery Cottage lay 200 yards away, to the north of the search radius. Searches were called off in the early evening due to the adverse weather conditions. Pottery Cottage At around 7.30 am, a local authority vehicle arrived to empty the septic tank, Hughes directed Gillian outside to greet them while warning her to \\"act normal\\". The council workers later recalled that there was nothing within her demeanour to suggest that anything was wrong. At this point Gillian caught a glimpse of her father, who was still sitting in the same armchair as the night before, she noted that \\"he wasn't moving [...] I couldn't see if he was injured or bleeding\\". Hughes dragged her away, telling her that Arthur was asleep. He instructed her to call her employer and her daughters school to inform them they were unwell and would not be coming in, when she asked about Sarah's whereabouts Hughes claimed that she was asleep in the annexe.. Richard was made to call his place of work to advise that he was ill and then Gillian was sent out alone to buy newspapers and cigarettes, with Hughes cautioning her \\"I've got your family here Gill don't do anything stupid\\". When Gillian returned, she noted that her father was no longer in the armchair, Hughes claimed that he was in his bedroom. Gillian made food and drinks for Hughes and her family throughout the day and, each time, Hughes took some through to Arthur and Sarah. She queried why her daughter had not asked for her \\"comfort towel\\" and a particular soft toy that she slept with every night, Hughes took the items through to the annexe, claiming Sarah \\"was really pleased to see them\\" on his return. After reassuring his hostages that he would be leaving that evening, he untied them while they drank a bottle of whiskey together and played card games. He took two trips out later that evening on the premise of preparing to escape, firstly taking both the Morans with him and then just Gillian, but the snow was still falling heavily and driving conditions were treacherous, so he remained at Pottery Cottage for a second night.. Gillian again asked Hughes about her daughter, requesting he bring her through from the annexe for the night, but he refused; Gillian later stated \\"He became very tense. I didn't mention it again because he frightened me and I wanted to keep him happy\\". 14 January 1977 Derbyshire Times: 14 January 1977 Hughes sent the Morans into Chesterfield to purchase supplies he'd need while on the run. During the journey, Richard tried to convince his wife that they should go to the Police, but fearing the repercussions for those still inside the house she refused.. Hughes spent the afternoon preparing to leave, he took food and other items through to the annexe and relayed conversations he claimed he'd had with Sarah, he then had the Morans drive him to Richard's place of work so he could steal the petty cash. Leaving Richard and Amy tied up and taking Gillian with him as a hostage, Hughes departed Pottery Cottage later that evening. After driving for several miles, he insisted on returning to the house claiming to have forgotten a map, he went back inside alone. He was gone for a considerable time and upon his return the car wouldn't start, he sent Gillian unaccompanied to a neighbours house to ask for a tow, she alerted them to the hostage situation and not having a phone, they fled the scene to get help. As Hughes angrily berated Gillian for warning the neighbours' his attention immediately shifted to the sight of Amy Minton coming towards them and then collapsing; Gillian later stated: \\"I couldn't believe it [...] She staggered very slowly towards the car.[...] I could see mum lying on her back in the snow [...] I was petrified [...] I was at my wits' end\\". Hughes forced Gillian to approach another neighbour for help, this time accompanying her and they were soon on their way.. The scene at Pottery Cottage Having been alerted by the Moran's neighbours, the Police arrived at Pottery Cottage just before 9 pm; they found Amy Minton's body, partially covered by snow, in the garden and the bodies of Richard and Sarah Moran and Arthur Minton inside the house. \\\\- all four had died as a result of multiple stab wounds to the throat and chest.. Despite Hughes maintaining the pretence that Arthur and Sarah were still alive throughout, both are thought to have been murdered on the first night. The chase Crash site, Rainow, Cheshire: 14 January 1977 Although Hughes had a head-start, the police soon caught up with him and thus began a high speed, multiple-car chase across Derbyshire and into Cheshire, ending when he crashed into a wall in the village of Rainow. Quickly surrounded and with Detective Chief Inspector Peter Howse leading the hostage negotiation, Hughes held an axe over Gillian's head and demanded a vehicle in which to escape. As firearms officers moved into place, a getaway vehicle was provided but Gillian refused to move. Howse later recalled: \\"Their relationship as hostage and captor had reached breaking point\\".. As Hughes made to strike Gillian with the axe, Howse jumped through the car window and tried to shield her while firearms officer Pell fired off the first shot; it took three further shots to incapacitate and kill him. Firearms officer Nicholls fired the final, fatal shot, marking the first time an officer from Derbyshire Constabulary had shot anyone dead. Official inquiries=Chief Inspector of the Prison Service inquiry Chief Inspector Gordon Fowler's report, issued March 1977, criticized the failure of management and staff at HMP Leicester to follow standard searching procedures after the knife disappeared from the prison kitchen. He was critical of the search methods used before prisoner transfers, recommending strip searches in all cases. He noted the lack of information provided by the Police to enable the Prison Service to categorise Hughes appropriately and he criticised the breakdown in communication between different prison departments which left his records incomplete. He made seventeen recommendations to be implemented immediately, all of which the Home Secretary, Merlyn Rees, accepted. Despite the issues highlighted in the report, disciplinary action wasn't initiated against any member of staff or management, as the failures were deemed to have been system failures and not the fault of any individual. Coroner's inquiry The inquest into the deaths at Pottery Cottage and the shooting of Hughes took place in Chesterfield on 27 April 1977.. Home Office Pathologist, Dr Alan Usher, confirmed that the victims at Pottery Cottage had died as a result of multiple stab wounds and that Hughes had died from gunshot wounds. Murder verdicts were returned for each of the victims at Pottery Cottage and a verdict of justifiable homicide in the case of Hughes. At the conclusion of the inquest, both Coroner and jury praised the bravery of Chief Inspector Howse for preventing Hughes from hitting Gillian Moran with the axe, with the latter recommending that he receive a commendation. He was duly awarded the Queen's Commendation for Brave Conduct in December 1977. Aftermath The funeral service for Sarah and Richard Moran and Arthur and Amy Minton took place at Brimington Cemetery, Chesterfield on 21 January 1977. Gillian required a police escort and a switch of cars on the journey to keep the media at bay. Responsibility for arranging the funeral of Hughes fell to the Home Office and he was originally scheduled to be buried at Boythorpe Cemetery, Chesterfield on 25 January. This triggered a protest from local residents who did not want him buried in the Chesterfield locality, they threatened to dig up his grave if he was interred there and they refilled the burial site prepared for the funeral. The service was switched at the last minute, and he was cremated, ironically, at the same location as his victims. Gillian Moran sold the exclusive rights to her story to the Daily Mail; she was interviewed by Lynda Lee-Potter and her account was serialised in eight parts, starting 14 February 1977. Beyond this, Moran never spoke to the media again about the events at Pottery Cottage.

Property B and 2-colorability  A hypergraph H = (V, E) is called 2-colorable if its vertex set V can be partitioned into two sets, X and Y, such that each hyperedge meets both X and Y. Equivalently, the vertices of H can be 2-colored so that no hyperedge is monochromatic. Every bipartite graph G = (X+Y, E) is 2-colorable: each edge contains exactly one vertex of X and one vertex of Y, so e.g. X can be colored blue and Y can be colored yellow and no edge is monochromatic. The property fo 2-colorability was first introduced by Felix Bernstein in the context of set families;. therefore it is also called Property B.  Exact 2-colorability  A hypergraph is called bipartite if its vertex set V can be partitioned into two sets, X and Y, such that each hyperedge contains exactly one element of X. To see that this sense is stronger than 2-colorability, let H be a hypergraph on the vertices {1, 2, 3, 4} with the following hyperedges: > { {1,2,3} , {1,2,4} , {1,3,4} , {2,3,4} } This H is 2-colorable, for example by the partition X = {1,2} and Y = {3,4}. However, it is not exactly-2-colorable, since every set X with one element has an empty intersection with one hyperedge, and every set X with two or more elements has an intersection of size 2 or more with at least two hyperedges. Every bipartite graph G = (X+Y, E) is exactly-2-colorable. Hall's marriage theorem has been generalized from bipartite graphs to exactly-2-colorable hypergraphs; see Hall-type theorems for hypergraphs. n-partiteness and rainbow-colorability  Given an integer n, a hypergraph is called n-uniform if all its hyperedges contain exactly n vertices. An n-uniform hypergraph is called n-partite if its vertex set V can be partitioned into n subsets such that each hyperedge contains exactly one element from each subset. An alternative term is rainbow-colorable. To see that n-partiteness is stronger than exact-2-colorability, let H be a hypergraph on the vertices {1, 2, 3, 4} with the following hyperedges; > { {1,2,3} , {1,2,4} , {1,3,4} } This H is 3-uniform. It is exactly-2-colorable by the partition X = {1} and Y = {2,3,4}. However, it is not 3-partite: in every partition of V into 3 subsets, at least one subset contains two vertices, and thus at least one hyperedge contains two vertices from this subset.  Comparison with other notions of bipartiteness  There are other natural generalizations of bipartite graphs. A hypergraph is called balanced if it is essentially 2-colorable, and remains essentially 2-colorable upon deleting any number of vertices (see Balanced hypergraph). The properties of bipartiteness and balance do not imply each other. Bipartiteness does not imply balance. For example, let H be the hypergraph with vertices {1,2,3,4} and edges: > { {1,2,3} , {1,2,4} , {1,3,4} } It is bipartite by the partition X={1}, Y={2,3,4}. But is not balanced. For example, if vertex 1 is removed, we get the restriction of H to {2,3,4}, which has the following hyperedges; > { {2,3} , {2,4} , {3,4} } It is not 2-colorable, since in any 2-coloring there are at least two vertices with the same color, and thus at least one of the hyperedges is monochromatic. Another way to see that H is not balanced is that it contains the odd-length cycle C = (2 - {1,2,3} - 3 - {1,3,4} - 4 - {1,2,4} - 2), and no edge of C contains all three vertices 2,3,4 of C. Balance does not imply bipartiteness. Let H be the hypergraph: > { {1,2} , {3,4} , {1,2,3,4} } it is 2-colorable and remains 2-colorable upon removing any number of vertices from it. However, It is not bipartite, since to have exactly one green vertex in each of the first two hyperedges, we must have two green vertices in the last hyperedge.

Three men died from their wounds, and three other people were seriously injured. A 25-year-old Libyan male refugee was arrested nearby shortly afterwards. On 29 June 2020, the suspect appeared by video link at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder. he is remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on 30 November 2020.  Attack  Shortly before 19:00 BST on 20 June 2020 a lone man shouting what a witness described as \\"unintelligible words\\" attacked two groups of people socialising. It happened in Forbury Gardens, a public park in the centre of Reading, Berkshire, England, about west of London. The attacker used a kitchen knife that a witness estimated to have been at least five inches (13 cm) long. The victims sustained injuries to the eye, neck, head, and back. A witness said the stabbing was \\"completely random\\". At 18:56 BST, officers from Thames Valley Police went to the park, responding to reports of a stabbing with multiple casualties. A suspect with a knife was chased, tackled, and pinned to the ground on Friar Street by police officers five minutes after the first 999 call was made. The man was arrested, initially on suspicion of murder, and later re-arrested while in custody under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. A Black Lives Matter protest had taken place at the park earlier in the day, but police said that the attack was not associated with the protest. Suspect The suspect is a 25-year-old man who was arrested near the park shortly after the attack. He was born in Libya and in 2018 was given permission to stay in the United Kingdom after claiming asylum in 2012. A family member said he had post-traumatic stress from the civil war and had come to the United Kingdom from Libya in 2012 to escape from violence there, living first in Manchester. The suspect was convicted six times for 15 crimes between 2015 and 2019, was said to have smoked cannabis, and had regular visits from a mental health professional. A security source told Reuters that the suspect had come to the attention of Britain’s domestic security agency MI5 in 2019 over intelligence that he aspired to travel for extremist purposes, and he had been investigated over jihadist concerns. He had been released from jail 17 days before the attack, having been sentenced for assault and possessing a bladed article. The Guardian reported that sources said that the suspect was believed by the intelligence agencies to have mental health problems. Sky News additionally reported that he lived in a flat in Reading. Casualties The attack resulted in three fatalities at the scene, as well as three seriously injured with knife wounds to their head, face, hand, and back. The Thames Valley Air Ambulance, Hampshire & Isle of Wight Air Ambulance and London's Air Ambulance were deployed to the scene, and South Central Ambulance Service deployed their Hazardous Area Response Team. Of the injured people, two were admitted to the Royal Berkshire Hospital's emergency department, in Reading. One other injured person was taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, but was discharged without being admitted. One of the injured was a friend of the three fatalities. The three men who were killed were friends and post-mortem examinations showed that they each died of a single stab wound; two were stabbed in the neck, and one in the back. They were a 36-year-old teacher at The Holt School, in Wokingham in Berkshire; a 39-year-old American citizen who worked for a pharmaceutical company and had been living in Britain for 15 years; and a 49-year-old senior scientist at the chemical company Johnson Matthey. Investigation Initial police statements from Thames Valley Police on the evening of the incident said that the incident was \\"not currently being treated as a terrorism incident\\" and that they were \\"keeping an open mind as to the motivation\\", although counter terrorism officers were deployed. The next morning, Counter- Terrorism Policing South East stated that the attacks were \\"a terror incident\\". It took over command of the incident from the local police, with support from MI5. Police were on 22 June granted a warrant of further detention with regard to the suspect until 27 June. Charges On 27 June 2020, the suspect was charged with three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder. Court proceedings On 29 June 2020, the suspect appeared by video link at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder. The prosecutor said the accused was heard shouting words to the effect of Allahu Akbar. He was remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey. After appearing at the Old Bailey by video link from Belmarsh Prison, London, for two preliminary hearings - firstly on 1 July and then again on 10 July, the judge set 30 November 2020 as a provisional date for a full trial.  Reactions  Prime Minister Boris Johnson expressed his condolences and thanked emergency services for responding to the scene. On the following morning, 21 June, Johnson met with senior ministers, police, and security officials at 10 Downing Street to be briefed on the events. Home Secretary Priti Patel and Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer both expressed concern over the incident. The leader of Reading Borough Council said he was \\"shocked and appalled\\" by the \\"horrific and senseless attack\\", expressed his condolences, and thanked the emergency services for their response. The council issued a statement saying that their \\"thoughts and prayers are with the families of the three people who lost their lives, and for those who remain seriously injured\\", and announcing that their flag would fly at half mast for the day.

Timeline Peoples helped make Junteenth recognized by the City of Portland in 1972. Mayor Sam Adams and Amanda Fritz declared Peoples the \\"Mother of Juneteenth\\" in 2011. Juneteenth became an observed holiday for the City of Portland and Multnomah County employees in 2020, as part of a resolution to address structural racism. Peoples and first Black Oregonian Senator Avel Gordly led an effort to make Juneteenth a statewide holiday in 2001. The resolution passed. Multnomah County first recognized Juneteenth in 2018, sponsored by County Commissioner Loretta Smith. That event celebrated and heard from Senator Gordly. Clara Peoples Clara Peoples (Née Clara Mae Walker) was born in Muskogee, Oklahoma on 8 September 1926. She moved to Vanport, Oregon in 1945, working for Kaiser Shipyards during the World War 2 shipbuilding efforts, where she started a Juneteenth event in 1945. Her family was flooded and displaced in the 1948 Vanport floods. Moving to 1406 NE Ainsworth with her husband Haley Peoples Sr. in the redlined area of Northeast Portland, she then organized efforts to feed people, which turned into the Community Care Association in 1969. By the following year the association was operating out of 2022 NE Alberta Street, rent-free from the anonymous building owner. The Alberta Street location was previously the Red and White store, seen in a 1931 photo, and was later the Don Pancho Taqueria and Market from 2000-2016. Later, Peoples and Arlene Grice became the first two Black elevator operators at Joseph Shemanski's Eastern Department Store. She was also the first Black person on the State Board of Agriculture. She was also a hall monitor at Adams High School. In 2011 and 2013, Oregon politician Lew Frederick introduced bills to recognize Peoples. It was enrolled and signed by the governor on May 1, 2013. Peoples died in October 5, 2015, at age 89. The annual parade was named the \\"Clara Peoples Freedom Trail Parade\\" beginning in 2016.

The purpose of PDMRO is \\"to save life and alleviate distress, primarily in Upland and Mountain areas\\". This is achieved by conducting search and rescue missions for walkers, climbers and missing persons in and around the Peak District National Park. The PDMRO is an affiliation of the seven member Mountain Rescue Teams (MRT) which cover the Peak District. These are Buxton MRT, Derby MRT, Edale MRT, Glossop MRT, Kinder MRT, Oldham MRT and Woodhead MRT. The PDMRO coordinates all rescue incidents across the teams and develops common good rescue practices amongst them. PDMRO also has close links with SARDA (Search and Rescue Dog Association) and with Derbyshire Cave Rescue. The organisation was established in 1964 in response to the death of two climbers caused by an avalanche in Wilderness Gully in the Chew Valley in 1963 and the deaths of three young scouts during the Four Inns Walk in 1964. Until the PDMRO was formed, there was only a few uncoordinated mountain rescue teams in the Peak District, using basic rescue equipment. Previously, from 1938 until the 1960s, the RAF 28 Maintenance Unit was based at Harpur Hill in Buxton and it included the RAF Mountain Rescue Service for the Peak District. On 3 November 1948 the RAF team was called out to locate the US Air Force (USAF) Boeing RB-29A Superfortress which had crashed near Bleaklow moor on the Kinder Scout plateau. All 13 crew perished in the tragedy and the crashed plane became known as the Bleaklow Bomber. Much of the wreckage is still visible at the crash site, where a memorial was erected in 1988.

Biography Mulikov was born in the city of Ashgabat in 1975. In 1996, he graduated from the Higher School of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, with a degree in law. He then began working in various positions in structural divisions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Until February 2009, he worked as Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs. From 27 February to May 2009, he was the head of the Police Department of Dashoguz. On 29 May 2009, he became the Minister of Internal Affairs by a separate decree of President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, and was appointed to the special rank of lieutenant colonel of police at the same time. In November 2009, he received a severe reprimand, the first of 12 over his career. He was reappointed minister on 28 February 2012 with rank of major general. In April 2013 he was demoted to colonel for improper management of subordinate units. Mulikov's rank as a major general was subsequently restored, and he was promoted to lieutenant general of police in June 2018. He was fired as minister of internal affairs on 1 October 2019. In dismissing Mulikov on national television, President Berdimuhamedow publicly ridiculed Mulikov, stripped him of his awards, and demoted him to the rank of major of police. (video) That same day, Mulikov was arrested. He was convicted on 19 October, and in December sentenced to 25 years in prison for accepting bribes and expropriation of private property. His public confession of guilt was broadcast on national television. (video) Accusations The following accusations were leveled publicly against Mulikov as justification for his dismissal: • Mulikov appointed a veterinarian, Berdimyrat Berdiýew, as acting director of a prison in Ahal Province; • A traffic police captain, Kerimguly Çaryew, was apprehended for misuse of his official vehicle, including transportation of Ashgabat municipal public utility workers; • Traffic police inspectors were found to be corrupt, including demanding bribes and threatening to confiscate automobiles without cause, and obstructing prosecution of friends; • An entrepreneur allegedly close to Mulikov, Çarymuhammed Kulow, was convicted of accepting unusually large bribes; • Mulikov declined to dismiss a deputy head of the Ashgabat passport division, Didamyrat Muhammedow, who is related to Kulow. Mulikov's personal chauffeur, Maksat Amanow, was reportedly arrested before Mulikov was. Amanow was allegedly the intermediary between Mulikov and Kulow, who in turn was allegedly responsible for managing Mulikov's business interests. These business interests reportedly included \\"several restaurants, cafes and stores in Ashgabat.\\" Independent media reported confiscation of the Okean Restaurant, Ayperi Cafe, and Turkish Dishes Cafe. An opposition newspaper reported that Mulikov was found guilty on 19 October 2019 of violating the following articles of the penal code: • Article 181, part 2 — Misuse of official position, causing serious consequences; • Article 181(1), part 2 — Violating the oath of office through misuse of official position, if that action was done out of greed or in other personal interests and caused significant violation of rights and freedoms of citizens, the statutory interests of society and the state; • Article 184, part 2, subparagraphs «a», «v» и «d» — Acceptance of a bribe (repeatedly, by an official occupying a position of responsibility, in large amount); • Article 184, part 3, paragraph «а» — Acceptance of a bribe (in unusually large amount). Mulikov confessed on television to accepting bribes and expropriating houses, both felonies. All of Mulikov's ill gotten properties were reportedly confiscated by the government. These included \\"illegally acquired residential houses, possessions in them, automobiles, and various valuables.\\" Mulikov was also accused privately of too close association with Kulow, who allegedly expressed intent to succeed President Berdimuhammedow during the latter's temporary disappearance from public view in 2019. This, rather than corruption, was allegedly the real reason for Mulikov's downfall.

She was the wife of Lord Edward Herbert and the mother of Barbara Herbert, Countess of Powis. Following her first husband’s death she married a Covent Garden singer, John Beard.  Biography  Born most likely in Ghent, Flanders to a grandson of James II and Arabella Churchill, she was the daughter of James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave, and Mary Webb, daughter of Sir John Webb, 3rd Baronet of Hatherop. In 1719, when she was two, her father left the Stuart court in St. Germaine, converted to the Anglican faith, moved to London, and showed his support for George I. This move, which he reportedly regretted on his deathbed, allowed him to resume his seat in the House of Lords, and catapulted him almost immediately to an Ambassadorship. Henrietta's brothers, including James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave, prospered from this move both financially and politically as well, James becoming briefly the Prime Minister of England. Henrietta, meanwhile, was raised Roman Catholic by her maternal grandparents, the Webbs, at their request.Jenkins, Neil, John Beard, Handel and Garrick’s Favorite Tenor, Bramber: Bramber Press, 2012 The Webb family owned property in Dorset, Wiltshire, and Gloucestershire, with their primary seat at Hatherop Castle. In July, 1734, when Lady Henrietta was 14, the Webbs arranged for her to marry Lord Edward Herbert, second son of William Herbert, 2nd Marquess of Powis, with prospects to inherit from his childless brother. Lord Edward died four months after the marriage, leaving her a widow who would give birth to a daughter, Barbara Herbert, Countess of Powis in 1735. On 8 January, 1739, at age 19, she secretly re-married, this time to a favorite singer of Handel and Garrick, John Beard of Covent Garden.http://www.planethugill.com/2013/05/john-beard-handelian-tenor-and- much-more.html.

These buttons carry the image of a phoenix bird, included regimental numbers and were, “made of a good grade brass”. By the time the buttons had been ordered, manufactured in England, and received in Haiti, Christophe was dead. What happened to these buttons after Christophe’s death is unknown until 1832 when they were purchased by Nathaniel Wyeth. Wyeth purchased the buttons to be included in his inventory of goods for sale in the Columbia River Region (now the border between Oregon and Washington States) where Wyeth hoped his business would successfully compete with the Hudson's Bay Company. It is still not fully documented how and when phoenix buttons ended up in California. There have been several historical and archeological research studies that have put together a likely chronology of events. 585x585px  Phoenix buttons arrival on the Columbia River  Emory Strong’s 1975 definitive article “The Enigma of the Phoenix Button” developed his previous work on phoenix buttons. Strong created the definitive analytic types of phoenix buttons still used in research, that categorizes them into three types and two sizes. When Strong’s 1975 article was written, the great majority of phoenix button were found along the Columbia River. In the late 1990s, Roderic Sprague mapped a wider distribution of phoenix buttons noting two areas of phoenix button occurrence, along the Columbia River and throughout Alta California. Sprague noted that the Columbia River Phoenix buttons seem to originate with Wyeth’s efforts to compete with the well-established Hudson Bay Company in that area. Wyeth’s ship, which was carrying much of his trading goods was “delayed due to misadventures in the Pacific” and did not arrive to the Columbia River until the Fall of 1834 and so it is unlikely that phoenix buttons could have arrived in that area before that date. Wyeth withdrew from the Columbia in late 1836 and at that time sold his entire operations west of the Rockies to the Hudson's Bay Company.  Phoenix buttons in California  Phoenix buttons have been found in archaeological excavations in California at several sites (see the Santa Cruz Mission Lost Adobe for one example). How the phoenix buttons got to California is still undocumented. Given that Wyeth sold his inventory to the Hudson Bay Company in 1836, it is likely that the phoenix buttons were part of the Hudson Bay Company trade to California. One possible trade route was via the trapper companies fur trade with the California indigenous peoples. The Hudson Bay Company had groups of fur trappers in Northern and Central California all through the 1830s, and into the early 1840s, led for many years by a Frenchman, Michel Laframoise. Their southernmost camp, known as French Camp, was near present day Stockton. However, if the Hudson Bay Company had issued the buttons to the trappers to barter with the indigenous peoples of Northern California’s Sacramento Valley, there should have been buttons found at indigenous sites in that area. None have been found. A more likely route is that the buttons were part of Hudson Bay Company’s shipping trade with the San Francisco/Monterey Bay area and then on to other places in the Mexican Republic zone. The Hudson Bay Company engaged Don Diego Forbes as a sales manager for California from 1834 to 1841. Forbes owned a large rancho [El Potrero de Santa Clara] where he farmed and traded. The Hudson Bay Company inventory of phoenix buttons would have likely been distributed by Forbes. Sprague’s 1990s maps cataloged where phoenix buttons had been found in California. He noted that buttons have been recovered at all Mission and Pueblo sites and some ranchos. That phoenix buttons were found at these sites suggests that phoenix buttons were distributed through the Mexican Republic zone of California via internal trade systems. . Phoenix buttons were also found at Fort Ross, Bodega Bay and at Sutter’s Fort. These communities traded extensively with the Bay Area Missions. Buttons were also found in the San Joaquin Valley at indigenous village sites. Some scholars have suggested phoenix buttons may have been used for “decorating Men’s clothing”,” and were items “associated with social displays of high status” among indigenous peoples. Many people in these villages were captured by the Spanish Missionaries. When they could escape, these people often returned to their home sites, often bringing with them goods from the missions, perhaps even these phoenix buttons.  Probable 1837 date for phoenix buttons arrival in California  Examining the Hudson Bay Company cargo ships arriving and departing from the San Francisco Bay area after 1836 (the date of Wyeth’s sale of his inventory to the Hudson Bay Company) there are three possible arrival date for phoenix buttons: January 1837 on the brig Lama; October 1837 on the schooner Cadboro(ugh); and Aug 1838, again on the schooner Cadboro(ugh). Ogden, Adele, Trading Vessels on the California Coast: 1787–1848, Vol. 2 pages 768, 792, 814 Unpublished manuscript, Bancroft Library, Univ. of California, Berkeley. Allowing time for bureaucratic inventory procedures by the Hudson Bay Company, the most likely of these arrivals is the 1837 run of the schooner, Cadboro(ugh), which left the Columbia River in September 1837 and arrives in first in San Francisco and then in Monterey, in October,1837 If Forbes were the commercial agent for the Hudson Bay Company, and assuming the trade went through his Rancho de Santa Clara, the earliest date the buttons were likely to arrive at various Mission establishments in the San Francisco Bay area would be the winter of 1837–38. The likelihood of this date is supported by a find of a phoenix buttons at the Petaluma Adobe in a buried trench for what appears to be the “hasty disposal of possibly contaminated possessions” infected by smallpox during the Miramontes epidemic of 1837-1839. It is likely that the buttons arrived in the Bay area of California no earlier than 1837 and no later than 1839.

She was an organizer with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) during the 1964 Freedom Summer.  Early life and education  Jean Smith Young was born Jean Wheeler in 1942. She grew up in Conant Gardens, Detroit, the daughter of a nurse and single mother. Her father, First Lieutenant Jimmie D. Wheeler, was a pilot and member of the Tuskeegee airmen who died during World War II. She graduated from Cass Technical High School in 1961 and continued on to Howard University on a full scholarship. While at Howard, Young was involved with the Nonviolent Action Group (NAG) and a member of the student council. As a young activist, she was one of many young women resisting what they saw as old-fashioned standards of respectability imposed by institutions. When asked by then-Dean of Women Patricia Roberts Harris to straighten her natural hair, Young refused. She graduated with honors and as a Phi Beta Kappa member in 1965. By that time, Harris had become an important mentor figure.  Activism  After becoming involved with NAG at Howard, Young signed up to be a field worker for SNCC in the summer of 1963. She would work as an organizer and community bridge leader with the group until 1967. After participating in integrated SNCC voter registration projects in southwest Georgia, Young and several close colleagues moved to work on the Mississippi project – which had less of an emphasis on involving white volunteers – after becoming disillusioned by the difficulty of educating and training white volunteers to be effective organizers. Young was a leader in the 1964 voter registration drive in Philadelphia, Mississippi and surrounding Neshoba County. The project was met with violence, as evidenced by the abduction and murder of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, and Young slept at night with a chair wedged under her doorknob for safety. While in Philadelphia, she worked to register voters and establish a local Freedom School. Although she once described SNCC as \\"a liberating experience for me as a woman,\\" Young left the organization in the late 1960s after perceiving that leadership roles had begun to be closed to women as the group formalized and narrowed its scope.  Writing  Young began having her writing published while she was still involved in the civil rights movement. In January 1964, her essay \\"And Let Us All Be Black Together\\" was published in Negro Digest. She would have several pieces of creative writing published in that magazine over the next few years, and a personal essay published in Redbook in 1967. Wheeler's best known work is the short story \\"That She Would Dance No More,\\" which was first published in Negro Digest in January 1967. The story deals thematically with self-destruction, misogyny, and internalized racism. Her other stories also involve such difficult issues, tracing the recurring patterns of oppression in Black history in the United States.  Later career  Young later went back to school and earned a master's degree, then went to George Washington University School of Medicine for her M.D. She works as a child and adolescent psychiatrist in Maryland.

As a musician, he is best known as the former bass player for industrial band Die Krupps and the punk band Male.  Career  In 1982, Esch founded the German-speaking punk band Feine Deutsche Art (FDA) as principal composer and lyricist.https://www.discogs.com/artist/882701-Feine-Deutsche-Art The band's first concert was supporting Die Toten Hosen in 1983. Further concerts in 1984, including supporting Family 5 and Stunde X, followed in Düsseldorf and the surrounding area. Their song Mit dem Rücken an der Wand (With Your Back Against the Wall) was included on local sampler Punk’s Not Dead. In 1985, FDA dissolved and a retrospective was issued in 1990 by Teenage Rebel Records. Based on Jim Jarmusch's film Stranger than Paradise, Esch founded a band of the same name in 1986. The group mainly played English, melancholic guitar pop in the style of The Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division. Esch acted as a lyricist, composer and bassist. In 1987, Esch founded the Strange Records label in collaboration with the Düsseldorf's city government. His band was discovered by Klaus Dinger and in the same year, recordings took place in La Düsseldorf's Düsseldorf studio, as well as performing together in concert. Growing from the collaboration, a new group was formed around Dinger in 1988, which went on to release an LP as Die Engel Des Herrn (The Angels of the Lord).https://www.discogs.com/artist/770117-Die-Engel-Des-Herrn In 1989, Esch joined the reformed band Die Krupps, who had already achieved cult status in the early 1980s with albums such as Stahlwerksynfonie and Wahre Arbeit / Wahre Lohn. Between 1989 and 1997 Esch recorded five albums and the band played more than 200 concerts in Europe and North America. After a break of several years, Die Krupps performed a reunion show in Leipzig in 2005. In 2011 on their 30th anniversary, Die Krupps participated in a double headliner tour through Europe together with Nitzer Ebb and played at the Kinetics Festival in Montreal and the Amphi Festival in Cologne. From 1990 to 1996 Esch studied German philosophy at the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf with a focus on aesthetics. Esch founded EPAG Enterprise Multimedia AG together with his brother Holger Esch in 1999. Rüdiger Esch had been working on a book about the electronic music history of his home town since 2012, which was published in October 2014 under the title Electri_city – Elektronische Musik aus Düsseldorf published by Suhrkamp Verlag.

CEO Tim Cook announced the plan in his WWDC keynote address on June 22, 2020. The transition is the third time Apple has migrated Macintosh to a new instruction set architecture (ISA). The first was the switch from the Mac's original Motorola 68000 series architecture to the new PowerPC platform in 1994, and the second was the transition from PowerPC to Intel x86, which was formally announced in June 2005. Apple first utilized the ARM architecture in 1993 in its Newton personal digital assistant, and since then has extensively deployed it throughout other product lines including iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch. Apple has designed its own custom ARM chips since 2009. Background=Early involvement with ARM In 1990, Acorn Computers made Apple the first significant third party user of its ARM architecture, in the Newton personal digital assistant. The deal moved the ARM project to the separate legal entity ARM Holdings, in which Apple took a 43% stake, and ARM was renamed from \\"Acorn RISC Machine\\" to \\"Advanced RISC Machines\\". Transition from PowerPC to Intel A first-generation MacBook Pro from 2006, one of the first line of Mac computers to feature an Intel processor instead of a PowerPC processor. Since Apple's 2005–2006 transition to Intel processors, all Macintosh computers have used Intel's x86 CPU architecture. During his 2005 WWDC keynote address, Steve Jobs noted that Intel-based processors outperformed IBM's PowerPC processors in terms of energy consumption, and that if Apple continued to rely on PowerPC technology, it would be unable to build the future Macs it envisioned, including higher-performance workstation computers and advanced laptops for a rapidly growing laptop market: \\"As we look ahead, we can envision some amazing products we want to build ... And we don't know how to build them with the future PowerPC roadmap.\\" By June 2006, only Apple's high- end desktop computer and server product were still using PowerPC processors. The hardware transition was completed when Intel-based Mac Pros and Xserve computers were announced in August 2006 and shipped by the end of the year. Apple ceased support for booting on PowerPC as of Mac OS 10.6 \\"Snow Leopard\\" in August 2009, three years after the transition was complete. Support for PowerPC applications via Rosetta was dropped from macOS in 10.7 \\"Lion\\" in July 2011, five years after the transition was complete. Processor development An illustration of the Apple A12Z processor. In 2009, Apple bought processor company P.A. Semi for million. At the time, it was reported that Apple bought P.A. Semi for its intellectual property and engineering talent. CEO Steve Jobs later claimed that P.A Semi would develop system-on- chips for Apple's iPods and iPhones. Apple then released a number of products with its own processors. Rumors of Apple shifting Macintosh to custom-designed ARM processors began circulating in 2011, when SemiAccurate predicted it would happen by mid-2013. In 2014, MacRumors reported that Apple was testing an ARM- based Mac prototype with a large Magic Trackpad. In 2018, Bloomberg reported that Apple was planning to use its own chips based on the ARM architecture beginning in 2020. In recent years, media reports documented Apple's frustrations and challenges with the pace and quality of Intel's technology development. Apple reportedly had trouble with Intel modems for iPhones in 2017 due to technical issues and missed deadlines. Meanwhile, a 2018 report suggested that Intel chip issues prompted a redesign of the MacBook. In 2019, Apple blamed Intel processor shortages for a decline in Mac sales. As of 2020, the Apple A12X processor used in the 2018 iPad Pro reportedly roughly matched the performance of Intel's Core i7 processor used in the MacBook Pro at the time. In the months and weeks leading up to the Apple's 2020 WWDC, multiple media reports anticipated an official announcement of the transition during the event. Transition to Apple Silicon Apple announced its plans to transition the Macintosh platform to Apple Silicon in a series of WWDC presentations in June 2020. The entire transition of the Macintosh product line is expected to take \\"about two years\\", with the first ARM-based Macs to be released by the end of 2020. Similar language was used during Apple's 2005–2006 transition to Intel, and that transition took about one and a half years instead. All first party apps included with macOS Big Sur release are compatible with x86-64 and ARM architectures. Other apps are similarly being made dual-platform, including prominent software packages such as Adobe Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, and Microsoft Word. To enable x86-native software to run on new ARM-based Macs, Rosetta 2 dynamic binary translation software is transparently embedded in macOS Big Sur. Universal binary 2 enables application developers to support both x86-64 and ARM64. To facilitate development of software for future ARM-based Macs, a prototype ARM-based Mac will be loaned to app developers for testing purposes. This Developer Transition Kit is significantly modified iPad Pro hardware inside of a Mac mini case. Former Intel principal engineer François Piednoël gave an outspoken personal opinion that Intel's \\"abnormally bad\\" quality assurance in its Skylake processors for the prior three years, making Apple \\"the number one filer of problems in the architecture\\", is one of the driving factors in Apple's decision to migrate away. Intel CTO Mike Mayberry countered that quality assurance problems may arise at large scale from any CPU vendor. Performance In an interview shortly after the announcement of the transition, Apple senior software engineer Craig Federighi praised the performance of the Developer Transition Kit (DTK), Apple's prototype ARM-based Mac: \\"Even that DTK hardware, which is running on an existing iPad chip that we don’t intend to put in a Mac in the futureit's just there for the transitionthe Mac runs awfully nice on that system. It's not a basis on which to judge future Macs ... but it gives you a sense of what our silicon team can do when they’re not even tryingand they're going to be trying.\\" Impact=Apple The transition may allow Apple to cut component costs, because it will no longer need to externally acquire expensive CPUs. Intel Sources estimated a modest negative impact on Intel's revenue in the short term, as Apple accounts for 2–4% of Intel's annual sales, and only 6.9–12% of the PC market in the United States of America and 7% globally. Longer-term speculation has entertained the possibility that the transition could prompt other PC makers to reevaluate their dependence on Intel's x86 architecture, as Macs are often considered to set trends in the personal computing industry. Developers As apps created to run on the iOS platform will be able to run natively on ARM-powered Macs, Apple hopes that the streamlining of software and hardware will make it easier for developers to build apps that will work across Apple’s entire range of devices. Users The transition could lead to thinner and lighter Mac laptops in the future, due to the power efficiency advantage that Apple's processors have over Intel's. Apps created for the iOS platform will be able to run natively on ARM-powered Macs, thus substantially enlarging the breadth of software available to the Macintosh platform. The transition to proprietary Apple silicon could severely restrict or even entirely eliminate hobbyist \\"Hackintosh\\" computers, wherein macOS is made to run on commodity PC hardware in violation of license restrictions. The Boot Camp software, which enables Intel-based Macs to natively run Microsoft Windows in an Apple-supported dual booting environment, will not be implemented on forthcoming Apple silicon based Macs. , Apple stated it has \\"no plans to direct boot into Windows\\" on ARM-based Macintosh computers. Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi suggested that virtualization technology is a viable alternative: \\"Purely virtualization is the route... Hypervisors can be very efficient, so the need to direct boot shouldn't really be the concern.\\" Microsoft had not commented on whether it would extend its ARM-based Windows license beyond OEM preinstallations. Reception As in the case following Apple's 2005 announcement of its plan to transition to Intel-based processors, concerns have been both raised and dismissed about Apple potentially suffering the Osborne effect as a result of the announcement, whereby consumer demand would drop due to advance public knowledge of obsolescence. Wired expressed skepticism that Apple's designers can elevate smartphone-related processors to the performance of a Mac Pro, and questioned the true duration of support for Intel binaries on ARM-based Macs and when the first version of the macOS that will not support Intel Macs will be released under Apple's vague commitment to do so \\"for years to come\\". On a positive note, Lauren Giret remarked that Apple might \\"succeed where Microsoft has failed\\" due to Apple's \\"tight integration\\" of hardware and software, and a vast collection of applications that can already run on the new platform.

Biography He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Hungarian immigrants Armin and Rachel Hartmann Bendiner. He was the second-oldest of five children, and raised in a cultured Orthodox Jewish household.Alessandro Pezzati, \\"The Reluctant Architect: Alfred Bendiner (1899-1964),\\" The SAA Archaeological Record, vol. 6, no. 3 (May 2006), pp. 41-43. The family moved to Philadelphia when he was a boy, where he attended public schools, and graduated from Northeast High School in 1917.Alfred Bendiner from Philadelphia Architects and Buildings. Bendiner won a scholarship to the Pennsylvania Museum School,Alfred Bendiner from Redwood Library and Athenaeum. but left after a year to enlist in the Students' Army Training Corps at the University of Pennsylvania. He was a sergeant and still stationed in Philadelphia when World War I ended in November 1918,Alfred Bendiner, Translated from the Hungarian: Notes toward an Autobiography (South Brunswick, NJ: A. S. Barnes, 1967). but his service earned him automatic admission to Penn. He studied architecture there under Paul Philippe Cret, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1922. Architect Moore School of Engineering Building, 33rd & Walnut Streets, Philadelphia Following graduation, he was employed as a draftsman in the office of Stewardson & Page for a couple years, before being hired by Cret. Bendiner worked on major Cret projects such as the Detroit Institute of Arts (1927), the Hartford County Courthouse (1929), and the Folger Shakespeare Library (1932). He also did early work on three battle memorials for American military cemeteries in Europe: the Château-Thierry American Monument (1937) and the Somme American Cemetery and Memorial (1937), in France; and the Flanders Field American Cemetery and Memorial (1937), in Belgium. While working as a Cret draftsman during the day, Bendiner completed a master's degree in architecture from Penn at night. Penn purchased a former piano factory at the southwest corner of 33rd & Walnut Streets to house the Moore School of Engineering. Cret's office designed alterations to the building, 1925-1926, with Bendiner as architect in charge. He took a year off to attend the American Academy in Rome, 1928-1929. Bendiner left the Cret office in 1933, and opened his own architectural office in Philadelphia, which remained in operation until his retirement in 1961. Finding clients was a challenge during the Great Depression, and commissions were few and far between. Most of his completed designs during this period were alterations to houses and commercial buildings, and the third story addition to the Moore School (1940).Pepper Musical Instrument Factory from Philadelphia Architects and Buildings. Archaeological draftsman The University of Pennsylvania Museum sponsored archaeological excavations at Tepe Gawra and Khafaji, Iraq, in 1937. Bendiner went along as project draftsman on the 8-month excavation, drawing site plans and sections of the dig, and making measured drawings of the artifacts uncovered.Alfred Bendiner, 1899-1964 from University of Pennsylvania Archives. He again worked as an archaeological draftsman on an excavation in Tikal, Guatemala, in 1960. Caricaturist Hungarian-American violinist Arthur Hartmann was Bendiner's uncle, and his maternal grandfather had also been a violinist. In 1938, Bendiner pitched himself to the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin as a music critic, but with a twist: each review would be illustrated by his caricature of the featured musician, drawn during the performance. His caricatures became highly popular, and he reproduced them as lithographs, earning him the moniker \\"The Hirschfeld of Philadelphia.\\" He retired from music criticism in 1946, and collected his favorite reviews and caricatures in the 1952 book Music to My Eyes. Muralist Bendiner's first mural commission was for Gimbel Brothers Department Store in Philadelphia, in 1952. The subject was a musical event that had occurred thirteen years earlier: Sergei Rachmaninoff performing as piano soloist in his Symphony No. 3 with the Philadelphia Orchestra.Alfred Bendiner from Michener Art Museum. Rachmaninoff had chosen the Philadelphia Orchestra under conductor Leopold Stokowski to perform the work's world premiere, November 6, 1936. He returned three years later to perform Symphony No. 3 under conductor Eugene Ormandy and to make the first recording of it. The mural depicted the December 2, 1939 concert at the Academy of Music, the composer/pianist's final appearance with the orchestra.Sergei Bertensson, Jay Leyda, and Sophia Satina, Sergei Rachmaninoff--A Lifetime in Music (New York: New York University Press, 1956). Rachmaninoff died in 1943. The mural is illustrated in Bendiner's autobiography. Fidelity Bank commissioned Bendiner to paint twin murals for its Rittenhouse Square branch: Rittenhouse Square, 1856 and Rittenhouse Square, 1956. He also painted murals for the offices of Blue Cross of Greater Philadelphia (1959); and The Story of Man for the University of Pennsylvania Museum.

Early life  Nasrallah was born on February 7, 1923, in Karbala. His father was Hassan Nasrallah (d. 1960), the son of Hammoud Nasrallah (d. October 26, 1901), the head of traders of Karbala in the Ottoman era and a very affluent man. His mother was the daughter of Murtadha Dhiya al- Din, the 19th (custodian) of the al-Abbas shrine. Both his parents hails from the noble Al Faiz family, and claim agnatic descent from Muhammad's daughter Fatimah and her husband, Ali, the first Shia Imam. His ancestors on some occasions ruled Karbala, and held custodianship of its holy sites.  Career  Nasrallah was nominated for chairman of the Karbala Chamber of Commerce by the traders of Karbala, and in 1959, he took on management of the chamber. He served for six terms, from November 1959 to October 1969, being the longest serving chairman of the chamber. The chamber began the al-Iqtisad magazine on July 15, 1960, under the supervision of Nasrallah. The chamber issued two magazines a month, and only had nine issues. Its final issue was released on December 15, 1960. Nasrallah enjoyed Arab-Islamic history and culture greatly, and decided to establish a library for the chamber, in 1963. After attaining permission from the higher authority, he formed a committee made up of employees from the chamber, and had them purchase a plethora of books, ranging from history books to books about business, religion, and science. Members of the committee travelled to other cities such as Baghdad and Najaf to purchase books, until a notable amount of books was collected in the library. The library kept expanding over the years until the 1991 uprising, which saw the Baathist forces destroy Karbala, and this included the chamber, which they burnt down, and only a few books remained from the chambers library. In 1965, Nasrallah endorsed a new date syrup factory in Karbala, in conjunction with the Industrial Bank, and the factory was established the following year. On February 28, 1968, Nasrallah sent a telegram, on behalf of all of Iraq's chambers of commerce, to Mohamed Makiya, endorsing his plans to revolutionize the city of Kufa by building a state of the art university, and large market. However the plans were opposed by the Baathists, who Makiya fell from favour with, and the project never saw light.  Personal life  Nasrallah was responsible for receiving the mourning processions representing the University of Baghdad on Ashura. Along with the sons of Ayatollah Hakim, he would receive over 2000 students and 1000 professors. The procession would arrive to Karbala on the ninth of Muharram, visit the two shrines, then return to their accommodation, which was spread across five Hussainiyah's, and spend the night there. Then they would wake up the following morning, on the tenth of Muharram, and attend a majlis at the al-Masloob Hussainiyah, that started with a recitation of Ziyarat Ashura, followed by a word by a Moroccan student, an elegy by an Algerian student, and finally, a closing speech by Nasrallah, where he thanks the university, and extends his hope that they are inspired by Husayn, whose ethics provide a socio-ethical blueprint that is exemplary in the way it articulates the values of Islam. Nasrallah held an annual festival at his home, where he would invite high officials and dignitaries to commemorate the birth of Fatimah. He would either invite Sayyid Hashem al- Qari, Sayyidd Mustafa al-Faizi Al Tumah, or other orators to give a sermon, and then a discussion would follow between those present, about the merits of Fatima and her noble cause during her lifetime. This gathering was popular enough to be featured in the local press. In August 1965, the office of Abd al-Salam Arif appointed Nasrallah as saden of the al-Abbas shrine, replacing his maternal cousin, Badr al-Din Dhiya al-Din. This decision came as a result of the governor of Karbala, Sultan Kirmashah reporting Dhiya al-Din to the president for being inept in his job. However, the real reason was that Kirmashah felt that Dhiya al-Din did not show him enough respect as someone in a more senior position. On the other hand, Nasrallah strongly rejected this ordeal, and believed his cousin was wrongfully dismissed, so he and other members of the Nasrallah and Dhiya al-Din families lobbied for the return of Dhiya al-Din, and by October 1965, Kirmashah was transferred away from Karbala, and Dhiya al-Din was reinstated as saden.  Death  Nasrallah spent the end of his life taking care of his library, that contained an array of different books, until he died on May 4, 1997.

Common indigenous and traditional foods include breadfruit, coconut, bananas, papaya, seafood, pandanus and bwiro. Additional imported foods, such as rice and flour, are also a part of people's diets and contribute to the cuisine as well. The practice of food preservation is a part of the history of the islands, and continues to occur today. Common foods and dishes Fish at the Marshall Islands Foods and dishes consumed on the Marshall islands includes breadfruit, bananas, coconut, papaya, rice and rice dishes such as sticky rice balls, seafood, fish and fried fish, coconut crab, chicken, pork, clams, sashimi, sea turtles and coconut water. Breadfruit is a staple food, as is fish, with an average Marshallese fish consumption amount consisting of 240 pounds annually. Fishing is a common activity on the islands, and there are 50 various phrases and words in the Marshallese language devoted to fishing techniques alone. Several foods, such as rice, flour, sugar and tea are imported into the islands, and are sometimes used to supplement foods that are indigenous to the islands. Traditional foods, dishes and customs Foods play a significant role in celebrations and special events on the islands. In Marshallese culture, it is a custom for foods to be provided to the Iroij, chiefs in the Marshall Islands, as a form of recognition and respect. Some traditional foods and dishes include pandanus, breadfruit, including bwiro, a breadfruit dish consisting of breadfruit paste that is fermented, wrapped in banana leaves and cooked in an underground oven, roasted breadfruit and mashed taro root. Copra, the dried meat or kernel of the coconut, is a significant export of the Marshall islands, and is used to make oil by pressing. In Marshallese culture, a kemem is a celebration party that commences upon a child's first birthday. At kemems it is traditional for a plethora of Marshallese and other various foods and dishes to be served, and along with food consumption, guests are typically encouraged to take some sort of household item from the home of the party. In Marshallese culture, a family's generosity is sometimes considered as relative to the family having a lessened amount of material items left after the kemen is over. Food preservation Food preservation has been an historic part of Marshallese culture and food security on the islands, and continues to be practiced today, although not as much as in the past. A dried pandanus paste continues to be produced by people on the northern atoll Ratak Chain islands of Ailuk, Likiep and Mejit, where it is referred to as mokwan, and also by people on the Ralik Chain islands of Ujae, Lae and Wotho, who refer to the paste as jããnkun.

It was first recorded in Lloyd's Register in 1848, when the owner was J. Allen, the Master was Richard Stuart and the Mate was Joseph Clutterbuck. The Sir Robert Seppings was named after the English naval architect of the same name, who had died in 1840. He had been Surveyor of the Navy between 1813 and 1835, and introduced several significant innovations in ship design. In 1852, the Seppings undertook two voyages on behalf of the British government to transport convicts from England to Tasmania and from Norfolk Island to Tasmania. India trade Between 1844 and 1852, the Sir Robert Seppings transported goods between India and London, and vice versa. Convict transport The Seppings sailed from Woolwich on 18 March 1852, carrying 220 female convicts destined for Tasmania. Accompanying them were at least 21 of their children. The Master was Richard S. Stuart, the First Mate was Thomas J. Clark and the Surgeon was Lennox T. Cunningham. The full list of female convicts transported on this voyage is available on the Convict Records website. In his general remarks, the surgeon reported that the Seppings was a 'fine vessel' of 620 tons, well adapted to carrying 220 female convicts from England to Hobart Town,Tasmania. The main hatchway had been fitted with iron bars instead of the large upright posts which tended to stop light and free ventilation. These were far superior to the wooden bars and the surgeon strongly recommends they should be fitted on all convict ships. One of the water closets for the prisoners was fitted on the top with an iron grating, the invention of the Honourable Captain Dundas, 'it answered most admirably' and after a similar one was fitted to the other water closet they were never bothered with bad smells. When the women embarked the weather was extremely cold, the winds from the north east. The wind changed to south west after several days and there was bad weather. A very large number of cases are on list in his journal, 337, of which 6 died from various diseases, and 11 were sent to the Colonial Hospital in Hobart. There were no cases of continued fever which the surgeon attributes to the care paid to ventilation, cleanliness and dryness. The voyage is described in the memoirs of James Montagu Smith, a 15-year-old boy seaman on his second voyage to Australia. He described the captain as a proud man who was good commander and competent seaman but who kept himself distant from the crew; all his dealings with them were through the first mate. According to Smith, both the first and second mates were \\"bad men, much addicted to drink\\". The surgeon, who was responsible for the wellbeing of the women, he described as a good doctor but an \\"infernal old scoundrel\\" that reminded him of a \\"lecherous old Turk in the midst of his harem\\". During the day, the women were allowed on deck and had their meals there if the weather was good but at night they were locked below deck. Discipline was enforced by promoting some of the convicts to \\"constables\\", tasked with overseeing their fellows in return for rewards. Punishments included being locked in the \\"Black Box\\", which Smith described as a sort of vertical coffin on deck, with only a few small holes at the top — too small to sit or lie down in, or even to stand comfortably. He says it was in use most days. One convict, Bridget Lyons, died during the voyage. According to Smith, she had been convicted of a murder in Liverpool with her husband, who had been hanged. Her sentence was transportation for life but she refused to eat and starved herself to death. Five of the convicts' children also died during the voyage. The surgeon named them as:- Mary Crooke (6 months), Eliza Denham (13 months), Mary Ann Calligan (18 months), Thomas Joyce (8 months), and Elizabeth Wilson (1 year). Smith says that the behaviour of the women became \\"exceedingly good\\" when they thought that they were approaching their destination. The Seppings reached Hobart on 8 July 1852, after a voyage of 112 days. The convicts were immediately taken to the Brickfields Hiring Depot, from where they could expect to be quickly hired out to a private employer, according to Smith. After several days in Hobart, the Seppings set sail, again on a government charter, this time destined for Norfolk Island. The mission was to collect about three hundred male convicts from Norfolk Island and bring them back to Port Arthur. The voyage took about three weeks. Smith describes how the men were brought on board in chains and secured below decks. On the voyage to Port Arthur, there was an attempt at mutiny by the convicts but it was put down by the detachment of soldiers on board. Several convicts were injured, none fatally, and all were delivered to Port Arthur. India trade again Once back in Tasmania, James Montagu Smith deserted from the Sir Robert Seppings. Smith says that all the ship's crew wanted to leave her but that his motive was different to theirs. He wanted to get away from a man that he hated, whereas the others were intent on joining the Victorian gold rush. Smith was so keen to leave the Seppings that he accepted a punishment of one month's jail with hard labour on the treadmill in preference to returning to the ship. After leaving Tasmania, the Seppings sailed for Madras to return to its earlier routine of voyages between India and London. In 1860, the Seppings was still owned by J Allen of London, and the former mate, Thomas J Clark was now master.

A single copy of the Chronicle survives across four partially damaged folios of the manuscript Brit. Mus. Add. MS 14642, where it immediately follows another anonymous Syriac chronicle, the Chronicle of 846. This copy is of 10th- or 11th-century date and the handwriting is poor. It is written in cursive Syriac script, and may not originally have been bound together with the other chronicle, which was copied in Esṭrangela script. It is also a palimpsest, being written over an erased Greek catena patrum. These factors make the decipherment of the text extremely difficult in places. The Chronicle as it stands begins with the death of the Syriac Orthodox patriarch Iwannis I in October 754. The last year entry is for 811, but the latest event recorded is the death of the Abbasid caliph al-Amīn in September 813. It also records the length of the complete reign of the Byzantine emperor Michael I from 811 to 813. The last sentence, referring to an event in May 812, is cut off. Probably it referred to the total solar eclipse of May 14. These may not be the original end points of the chronicle. It almost certainly began earlier than 754. Its earlier entries may have been copied in a companion manuscript now lost. It is more likely that it originally ended in 813 (like the copy), but it is not impossible that it once extended much later. The Chronicle of 813 is written from a Miaphysite (Syriac Orthodox) perspective. It is unrelated to the Chronicle of 846, but is related to the 12th-century world chronicle of Michael the Syrian, although it does not appear to have been a source for it. Rather, for the period covered by the Chronicle (754–813), both works largely rely on the same source. The relationship of the Chronicle of 813 to the lost chronicle of Dionysios of Tel Maḥre, which Michael is known to have used, is unclear because Dionysios completed his work in 842, long after the existing Chronicle of 813 ends. There is one known discrepancy between the Chronicle of 813 and that of Dionysios. The former places the death of the anti-patriarch John of Kallinikos in the Seleucid era 1073, while Eliya of Nisibis quotes Dionysios placing it in the Seleucid year 1074. The Chronicle contains little that is not also in Michael, but on a few occasions more detail is given. It is considerably more detailed than the laconic Chronicle of 846. It has a strong ecclesiastical focus, although it does record famines and earthquakes. It contains a valuable description of the anarchy that engulfed Syria following the death of the caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd in 809. It is also contains important information on the growth of the Christian community in largely pagan Ḥarrān (Karrhai). It is the earliest source to mention the miracle of the cut-up lamb in the conversion of Anthony Rawḥ.

The Norfolk Mission College (NMC) was a privately funded public school for African American students in the Norfolk, Virginia area. The school was established by the United Presbyterians and the first class started in 1883. NMC taught thousands of students at various levels of education and provided for students who could not afford the fifty cent tuition. The school lasted until 1916 and was then sold to the Norfolk school board and turned into Booker T. Washington High School. In 1955, that building was demolished and now the Blyden Branch of the Norfolk Public Library is located on the same spot.  About  The Norfolk Mission College (NMC) was located on Princess Anne Road in Norfolk, Virginia and included two buildings for classes, a school dormitory, a church and a home for the school's principal. The United Presbyterians founded the school in 1882 when Reverend Matthew Clark discovered a need for African-American schools in Norfolk in 1882. The school started out teaching 467 students in the first year, when classes started in January of 1883. After that, the school taught significantly more students, with there being 1,050 students enrolled in 1884. The first principal was Reverend Clarke who worked for the Freedmen's Mission of the United Presbyterians board. The first class of NMC graduated in May of 1888. The school charged tuition, which was around 50 cents, though waived the fee for students who could not afford to pay. NMC educated African-American students and was the first privately funded public school for black students in Norfolk. Curriculum taught at the school included the usual subjects, such as math, science and history and also included Latin and classes on the Bible. The school taught primary level classes, intermediate grades and high school level classes. When enrollment decreased, the United Presbyterian church sold the school in 1916 or 1917. The school was purchased by the school board in Norfolk and the John T. West High School was moved there. Later, the school was known as the Booker T. Washington High School. The building was demolished in 1955 and the Blyden Branch of the Norfolk Public Library is now located on the same spot as the original college. Before the building was demolished, graduates of NMC used to hold an annual reunion at the former college.  Notable students  * L.

So far, several versions of this engine, intended to propel Miura 1, have been developed and tested on the company's own liquid propulsion test facilities located in Teruel, Spain. Revisions In the first versions of the engine the propellants are driven to the engine by using a pressure-fed cycle with Helium.https://pldspace.com/images/MIURA_1/MIURA1_Payload_Users_Guide.pdf Later versions of the engine (TEPREL-C) incorporate a turbopump.http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/space_transportation/LAUNCHER_WS_Presentation_PLDSpace.pdf TEPREL-DEMO The TEPREL-DEMO engine, originally called NetonVac1, was first tested in 2015. It is a calorimetric engine model, intended to demonstrate combustion stability as well as to acquire relevant information such as ignition and shut-down sequences, pressures and temperatures along the engine, thrust and propellant mass flow rates at different thrust profiles. Additionally, the engine served to test all associated hardware and software at PLD Space Propulsion Test Facilities. The engine is capable to produce a thrust of 28 kN at sea level. TEPREL-A With the TEPREL-A engine, first tested in 2017, the company included several design upgrades, such as a new combustion chamber designhttps://twitter.com/PLD_Space/status/882519746125680641, an improved injector geometry and a regenerative cooling system. The later enables the engine to fire for nearly 2 minutes, which is the envisaged nominal functioning duration for the suborbital launch vehicle Miura 1. At sea level, the engine produces a thrust of 32 kN. TEPREL-B TEPREL-B is the first flight version of the TEPREL engine. Several design improvements have been implemented to reduce the overall weight of the engine. It is equipped with a thrust-vector-control systemhttps://spacenews.com/pld-space-completes- critical-testing-of-its-teprel-b-rocket-engine/ and a convergent-divergent nozzle, all regeneratively cooled.https://twitter.com/RaulTorresPLD/status/1301132303297519616 In May 2019 the first unit of this model was destroyed during a test.

After the Confederates retreated from Atlanta, the regiment was part of a force that made an unsuccessful attack against a Union garrison during the Battle of Allatoona on October 5. The regiment then followed General John Bell Hood's Confederate Army of Tennessee into Tennessee, where it charged the Union works at the Battle of Franklin on November 30. At Franklin, the regiment suffered over 60 percent casualties, including the loss of many company commanders. After Franklin, the regiment was detached from the rest of the army to build fortifications, missing the Battle of Nashville. In March 1865, the regiment was transferred to Mobile, Alabama. On April 9, 1865, the regiment was captured at the Battle of Fort Blakely; the survivors of the regiment were paroled at Jackson, Mississippi in May after the Army of Tennessee surrendered. Organization The 2nd Missouri Infantry Regiment and 6th Missouri Infantry Regiment had suffered heavy losses in the early stages of the American Civil War. The two regiments had been captured when the Confederate States Army surrendered Vicksburg, Mississippi on July 4, 1863. After the men of the two regiments were paroled and officially exchanged, the units were consolidated on October 6, 1863, forming a new regiment known as the 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry Regiment (Consolidated). Colonel Peter C. Flournoy, formerly of the 2nd Missouri Infantry, commanded the new regiment. Thomas M. Carter was the consolidated unit's first lieutenant colonel, and William F. Carter was the first major. As of the consolidation date, the regiment contained ten companies. Companies A, EG, and I contained men from the 2nd Missouri Infantry and Companies BD, H, and K contained men from the 6th Missouri Infantry. Service history=Atlanta campaign and Allatoona After the consolidation, the regiment was stationed at Demopolis, Alabama, where it was issued new uniforms and weapons. The 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry, along with the rest of the First Missouri Brigade, transferred to Meridian, Mississippi on October 19, 1863. In January 1864, the brigade returned to Alabama, but was sent back to Meridian on February 5 due to the threat posed by the Union forces of Major General William T. Sherman. Later, the unit was sent back to Alabama, where it remained until the start of the Atlanta campaign in May. At the beginning of the Atlanta campaign, the regiment mustered 560 men, making it the largest unit in its brigade. Confederate fortifications at Kennesaw Mountain On June 18, the First Missouri Brigade was engaged in a small action in the vicinity of the Lattimer House. After this action, the brigade then fell back to Kennesaw Mountain. On June 27, the First Missouri Brigade, commanded by Brigadier General Francis M. Cockrell, defended a portion of the Confederate line at a point known as Pigeon Hill. Union skirmishers hit the Confederate line at around 8:00 a.m., followed by more Union troops. The Confederate skirmish line held for some point, but Union pressure drove in the left flank of the line. The right flank of the skirmish line was later ordered to fall back, suffering heavy losses in the retreat. Union troops then charged Cockrell's main line, but were replused. Flournoy is reported to have fought with the Confederate skirmish line. Despite having won the battle, Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston ordered a retreat from Kennesaw Mountain. On July 3 and 4, the 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry saw light action near Smyrna, Georgia; several men of the regiment were killed in the actions. The First Missouri Brigade was present at the Battle of Peachtree Creek on July 20. While Major General Samuel Gibbs French, commanding the division the 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry was in, reported that only skirmishers of his division were engaged, a lieutenant in the 3rd and 5th Missouri Infantry Regiment (Consolidated) wrote that the First Missouri Brigade was subject to \\"hot and heavy\\" fire for five hours during the battle. After Peachtree Creek, the regiment fell back to Atlanta, Georgia. The 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry was left to defend the Atlanta fortifications during the July 28 Battle of Ezra Church, and missed a bloody Confederate defeat. During the Siege of Atlanta, the 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry and the rest of the First Missouri Brigade defended a portion of the northwestern edge of the city. The regiment saw action throughout the siege, until the Confederates abandoned the city. At that point, the regiment transferred to Lovejoy's Station, Georgia. The Confederate positions at Lovejoy's Station were rather weak and were subjected to enfilade fire from Union artillery. While stationed at Lovejoy's Station, some of the men of the 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry were engaged in a small action on September 6. Over the course of the entire Atlanta campaign, the regiment reported 196 casualties. In October, General John Bell Hood, commander of the Army of Tennessee, sent French's division against a Union outpost at Allatoona, Georgia. At the Battle of Allatoona on October 5, the 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry was aligned on the left of the First Missouri Brigade. The Confederate charge hit the Union line hard, but the main Union position was not taken.. The First Missouri Brigade charged the Union works at least four times. Eventually, Union reinforcements threatened to cut French's line of retreat, and the Confederates fell back from the field. The 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry lost 91 men at Allatoona. Franklin and Fort Blakely Battle of Franklin After Allatoona, the regiment moved into Tennessee along with Hood's army. The regiment then fought at the Battle of Franklin on November 30. The 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry was on the left of the brigade's line during the charge. Once the charge hit the Union line, a portion of the brigade was crowded behind Major General John C. Brown's division as the Confederate attacked a farm owned by the Carter family. Some of the Union troops had been placed forward of the main Union line, and these troops were driven back. However, once the Confederates got close to the main Union line, heavy fire met the attackers. Company G of the regiment saw 21 of its 30 members killed or wounded. The regiment's flag was captured during the fight. Cockrell was taken out of the fight with multiple wounds. Franklin cost the 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry 164 men, which was over 60 percent of the unit's strength. Eight company commanders were among the Franklin casualties. After Franklin, the regiment advanced to the Nashville, Tennessee area on December 2. On December 10, the regiment was detached to the Duck River to build fortifications. The regiment did not rejoin the rest of the Army of Tennessee until January 1865, missing the Battle of Nashville. After spending the winter in Mississippi, the regiment was transferred to Mobile, Alabama in late March, where the regiment was part of the garrison of Fort Blakely. At the Battle of Fort Blakely on April 9, the 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry was holding a position known as Redoubt Four. Despite a spirited defense by the Confederates, the position was quickly overrun. Cockrell and 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry surrendered in the works. The survivors of the regiment were sent to Ship Island, Mississippi for some time before being transferred to Jackson, Mississippi, where the men were paroled in May. The rest of the Army of Tennessee had surrendered on April 26.

Often, the moves of the game allow any number to be reduced by subtracting a value from a specified subtraction set, and different subtraction games vary in their subtraction sets. These games also vary in whether the last player to move wins (the normal play convention) or loses (misère). Another winning convention that has also been used is that a player who moves to a position with all numbers zero wins, but that any other position with no moves possible is a draw. Examples Examples of notable subtraction games include the following: *Nim is a game whose state consists of multiple piles of tokens, such as coins or matchsticks, and a valid move removes any number of tokens from a single pile. Nim has a well-known optimal strategy in which the goal at each move is to reach a set of piles whose nim- sum is zero, and this strategy is central to the Sprague–Grundy theorem of optimal play in impartial games. However, when playing only with a single pile of tokens, optimal play is trivial (simply remove all the tokens in a single move).; ; , \\"Green hackenbush, the game of nim, and nimbers\\", pp. 40–42. *Subtract a square is a variation of nim in which only square numbers of tokens can be removed in a single move. The resulting game has a non-trivial strategy even for a single pile of tokens; the Furstenberg–Sárközy theorem implies that its winning positions have density zero among the integers.; *Fibonacci nim is another variation of nim in which the allowed moves depend on the previous moves to the same pile of tokens. On the first move to a pile, it is forbidden to take the whole pile, and on subsequent moves, the amount subtracted must be at most twice the previous amount removed from the same pile.; *Wythoff's game is played by placing a chess queen on a large chessboard and, at each step, moving it (in the normal manner of a chess queen) towards the bottom side, left side, or bottom left corner of the board. This game may be equivalently described with two piles of tokens, from which each move may remove any number of tokens from one or both piles, removing the same amount from each pile when both piles are reduced. It has an optimal strategy involving Beatty sequences and the golden ratio.; Theory Subtraction games are generally impartial games, meaning that the set of moves available in a given position does not depend on the player whose turn it is to move. For such a game, the states can be divided up into \\\\mathcal{P}-positions (positions in which the previous player, who just moved, is winning) and \\\\mathcal{N}-positions (positions in which the next player to move is winning), and an optimal game playing strategy consists of moving to a \\\\mathcal{P}-position whenever this is possible. For instance, with the normal play convention and a single pile of tokens, every number in the subtraction set is an \\\\mathcal{N}-position, because a player can win from such a number by moving to zero. For normal-play subtraction games in which there are multiple numbers, in which each move reduces only one of these numbers, and in which the reductions that are possible from a given number depend only on that number and not on the rest of the game state, the Sprague–Grundy theorem can be used to calculate a \\"nim value\\" of each number, a number representing an equivalent position in the game of nim, such that the value of the overall game state is the nim-sum of its nim-values. In this way, the optimal strategy for the overall game can be reduced to the calculation of nim-values for a simplified set of game positions, those in which there is only a single number.; , \\"Games with heaps\\", p. 82. The nim-values are zero for \\\\mathcal{P}-positions, and nonzero for \\\\mathcal{N}-positions; according to a theorem of Tom Ferguson, the single-number positions with nim-value one are exactly the numbers obtained by adding the smallest value in the subtraction set to a \\\\mathcal{P}-position. Ferguson's result leads to an optimal strategy in multi-pile misère subtraction games, with only a small amount of change from the normal play strategy., p. 164; , \\"Ferguson's pairing property\\", p. 86. For a subtraction game with a single pile of tokens and a fixed (but possibly infinite) subtraction set, if the subtraction set has arbitrarily large gaps between its members, then the set of \\\\mathcal{P}-positions of the game is necessarily infinite., Theorem 4.1, p. 451. For every subtraction game with a finite subtraction set, the nim-values are bounded and both the partition into \\\\mathcal{P}-positions and \\\\mathcal{N}-positions and the sequence of nim-values are eventually periodic. The period may be significantly larger than the maximum value x in the subtraction set, but is at most 2^x., Example (a), p. 454; However, there exist infinite subtraction sets that produce bounded nim-values but an aperiodic sequence of these values. Complexity For subtraction games with a fixed (but possibly infinite) subtraction set, such as subtract a square, the partition into P-positions and N-positions of the numbers up to a given value n may be computed in time O(n\\\\log^2 n). The nim-values of all numbers up to n may be computed in time O(\\\\min(ns,nm\\\\log^2 n)) where s denotes the size of the subtraction set (up to n) and m denotes the largest nim-value occurring in this computation. For generalizations of subtraction games, played on vectors of natural numbers with a subtraction set whose vectors can have positive as well as negative coefficients, it is an undecidable problem to determine whether two such games have the same P-positions and N-positions.

Career Choir stalls of Westminster Abbey On graduating from Cambridge in 1949, Whitworth was appointed to the choir of Westminster Abbey as a singing lay vicar and remained there for 22 years. He also worked as a singing master at Reigate St Mary's, a choir school in Surrey, but later switched to teaching maths at the Westminster Abbey Choir School, to reduce the strain on his voice. Whitworth's first solo engagement as a professional singer was in 1950, in Handel's Messiah at the Methodist Central Hall, Westminster. Not long after that he was singing with the Deller Consort in radio broadcasts. In 1952 he sang songs by William Byrd solo for the BBC.Charlotte Smith, \\"Obituary: John Whitworth, countertenor\\" in Gramophone, 5 September 2013, accessed 22 June 2020 Soon after his arrival at Westminster Abbey, Whitworth met the organist Michael Howard, founder of the Renaissance Singers, whose aim was to promote a liturgical revival of the great music of the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the Restoration. The two worked closely together, with Whitworth taking on the position of director of the group. Living in London, Whitworth was in much demand as a singer and also as a choir director for recitals, concerts, recordings, and BBC Radio broadcasts. He also toured with the Golden Age Singers. While still at Westminster Abbey, Whitworth was organist of Christ Church, Chelsea, in 1964–1965 and of St Paul's, Covent Garden, from 1965 to 1970. In 1965 he was also appointed as a Professor at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Among the students he taught there was the countertenor Peter Giles.Peter Giles, A Basic Countertenor Method for Teacher and student (Kahn & Averill, London, 2005, ), p. viii Whitworth gave up all his London positions in 1971 to become a music adviser to Leicestershire County Council, a post he held until his retirement at age 65 in 1986. In 1988 he began to teach at Uppingham School, where one of his students was the countertenor Robin Blaze. He also took a research interest in early music, transcribing many compositions from primary sources in the British Library and the British Museum, and was the editor of a hymn book.\\"John Whitworth\\", in The Daily Telegraph, 8 September 2013, accessed 28 June 2020 Whitworth was the second most prominent countertenor in England after Alfred Deller during the countertenor revival of the 1940s and 1950s, and they sang together in duets by John Blow and Henry Purcell. The critic Richard Lawrence considered Whitworth a better singer than Deller, writing in Gramophone in 2005: Private life In 1963 Whitworth married Patricia Fitzgerald, and they had three daughters, Alexandra, Juliet and Victoria.

The first Burmese police surgeon in British Burma, Ba Than founded and ran the main hospital in Rangoon (Yangon) as well as the wartime medical and nursing schools during the Japanese occupation of the country (1942–1945). After the country's independence in 1948, Ba Than served several terms as dean and rector of the main medical universities in Rangoon and Mandalay until two months before his death in 1971. He is also known for his autopsies of famous politicians, including those of Aung San and Tin Tut. His daughter Khin May Than, third wife of General Ne Win, was the First Lady of Burma from 1962 to 1972. Early life and career St. Paul's High School where Ba Than graduated from in the 1910s Ba Than was born to U Kinn and Daw Swei in May 1895 in Pyuntaza, a small town about northeast of Yangon (Rangoon), in what was then British Burma.Khin Thet-Hta et al 2005: 84 His parents were apparently well-to-do as he graduated from Rangoon's St. Paul's English High School, went to Rangoon College in 1914,Kyaw Myint 2020 and went on to study medicine at the University of Calcutta where he received an MB in 1922. (Burma's first MBBS program began only in 1923.) He started out as a Civil Assistant Surgeon (CAS) in the Health Department in 1922,(Khin Thet-Hta et al 2005: 84) says Ba Than received his MB and became a CAS in 1922. But (Civil List 1942: 56) says he became a civil surgeon in the Indian Medical Department on 23 July 1921. The seeming discrepancy may perhaps be due to one of the following: (1) Ba Than joined the service as a resident before he got his degree; or (2) (Khin Thet Hta)'s 1922 date is incorrect. However, given that Ba Than was only a first year student at Rangoon College in 1914 per (Thane Oke Kyaw Myint 2020), he most probably went to Calcutta only in 1916 and received his MB in 1922. He apparently joined the service as a resident in 1921. and received his FRCS certification from the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1932.Myint Swe 2014: 5, 82 By then, Ba Than was part of the tiny colonial era medical community made up mainly of foreign-born physicians and specialists that existed primarily in Rangoon.(Myint Swe 2014: xi–xii): About half of the physicians and most of the specialists at Rangoon General Hospital were foreign born. To see a specialist, everyone in the country needed to go to RGH. The \\"small medical system was run mainly by foreigners and the tiny elite for foreigners and the tiny elite.\\" (Myint Swe 2014: 134–135): It was exceedingly difficult to get into medical school even in the late colonial period. The class size was disproportionately small for the size of country's population (13.2 million in 1921 and 16.8 million in 1941 (per Saito and Lee 1999: 1)). Between 1922 and 1941, a grand total of 543 students graduated from Rangoon Medical College (RMC), or 27 new graduates on average each year. Of the grand total, the number of indigenous Burmese graduates was only 228 (42%), or less than a dozen per year. Known for his extreme work ethic—his motto was \\"zwe\\" (ဇွဲ, lit. \\"perseverance, persistence\\"),Myint Swe 2014: 5–6 the surgeon by the late 1930s had risen to be the deputy head of the surgery department at Rangoon General Hospital (RGH)Myint Swe 2014: 5–6 and the first Burmese police surgeon.Kyaw Myint 2006 His first high-profile case came in 1938 when he led the autopsy of Aung Kyaw, a student leader killed by the colonial police, amidst nationwide protests against the colonial government.Secretariat 1939: 14 In 1937, Ba Than also began teaching at Rangoon Medical College as a lecturer in forensic medicine. He was an inspiration for Burmese medical students. According to Myint Swe, who studied at RMC from 1939 to 1942, Ba Than and one Henry Aung Khin(India and Burma Office List 1945: 242): Lt. Col. Henry Aung Khin (born 8 December 1887; MB, FRCS) was first commissioned as an IMS medical officer on 1 November 1920, started at Rangoon General Hospital in October 1924, and retired in December 1942. (Crawford 2012: 572): Aung Khin received his M.B. Ch. B. in 1911; joined the IMS as a Temporary Lt. in 1915; became a permanent Lt. in 1920; promoted to Major in 1926; became an FRCS in 1926. (Burma Civil List 1942: 55): Aung Khin was promoted to Lt. Col. in 1934. (Myint Swe 2014: 5): Lt. Col. H. Aung Khin was a lecturer in surgery at Rangoon Medical College in the 1930s. were the only two surgeons of indigenous Burmese descent he knew of at the time. (Myint Swe apparently did not recall that there was at least one other Burmese practicing FRCS surgeon at the time. She was Dr. Yin May, who received her FRCS in gynecology from RCS Edinburgh in 1929,Who 1961: 103 three years before Ba Than. Another FRCS surgeon was Dr. Saw Sa, who became the first woman legislator in the colonial parliament in 1937.Kolås 2019) Japanese occupation period (1942–1945) Rangoon General Hospital was taken over by the Imperial Japanese Army (1942–1945). Ba Than is best remembered for founding the main hospital in Rangoon to serve non- Japanese patients during the Japanese occupation of Burma (1942–1945) during World War II. The hospital served Burma Independence/Defence Army (BIA/BDA) and Indian National Army (INA) officers and troops as well as the general public. He also founded the wartime medical and nursing schools. Wartime hospital Ba Than came to found the hospital out of sheer necessity in wartime Burma. He was one of the few physicians, and of even fewer specialists, who had not evacuated the country along with the British administration.Myint Swe 2014: xii Furthermore, the city lost its main hospital when the Imperial Japanese Army seized and reserved Rangoon General Hospital only for the Japanese (soon after the IJA and their allies Burma Independence Army (BIA) took the city on 7 March 1942). The incoming Japanese administration sent Dr. T. SuzukiDr. T. Suzuki was not Maj. Gen. Keiji Suzuki, who recruited the Thirty Comrades. Per (Myint Swe 2014: 20), Dr. T. Suzuki was a Japanese national who operated a private medical clinic (\\"Suzuki Maternity Clinic\\") in Rangoon before WWII started. When the Japanese Army came, Suzuki became the Chief Administrator of the BIA Hospital with the rank of \\"major general\\" (presumably a military physician rank) for a brief period. Suzuki went on to open a new clinic called Dojingai in the Kandawgalay section of Rangoon. to ask Ba Than to found a new hospital for the BIA. Ba Than agreed, and in late March, with one other physician and an assistant, opened a \\"hospital\\" in the building of Anglican Diocesan School of Rangoon, with an outpatient clinic and a few beds.Myint Swe 2014: xiii Ba Than faced several challenges from the outset. The most pressing was staffing. With most trained personnel gone, he had to resort to taking in final year medical students and nurse trainees. He was able to persuade most of the few remaining doctors and nurses in the country to join his fledgling outfit. Three highly experienced specialists—Dr. S. Sen (as Head of Internal Medicine), Dr. Yin May (as Head of Maternity Unit) and Dr. Chan Taik (as Head of Ophthalmology)—did join. Indeed some like Dr. Yin May, Dr. Sen and senior nurse Khin Kyi had chosen to return to Rangoon.(Maung Wa 2009: 121–122, 213–215): Yin May and her family fled to Upper Burma but she somehow got separated from her family. (Myint Swe 2014: 98): Yin May returned to Rangoon. (Myint Swe 2014: 63): Dr. S. Sen (MB Calcutta, FRCP Glasgow, MRCP London, FCCP US, DTM&H; London) was in Mogok but came to join his former RGH colleague Ba Than's outfit. According to Myint Swe, Sen was rumored to have had a hand in the escape of Ba Maw from prison in Mogok. This suggests that Sen may have been collaborating with Ba Maw and Ba Maw's allies, the INA. (Wintle 2013: 111–112): Khin Kyi was already in Calcutta in February 1942, and took what turned out to be the last boat back to Rangoon. To be sure, not everyone who remained joined. Myint Swe, who joined the hospital as a resident in April 1942, recounted an exchange in English between Ba Than and a former colleague of Ba Than who came to see the \\"hospital\\": the man reportedly remarked that \\"a handful of fellows can't do anything\\" to which Ba Than responded \\"it's the determined few that command the crowd.\\"Myint Swe 2014: 133 Ba Than was determined to prove his skeptics wrong. He worked tirelessly at the hospital, often sleeping at the hospital throughout the years. In the early days of the hospital, he handled all types of cases, not just surgery ones.Myint Swe 2014: 7 Over the next six months, he pieced together the staff, equipment, and supplies to have a semblance of a functioning hospital. Under his leadership, the hospital became the main to-go place for all non-Japanese patients, not only the BIA/BDA and INA brass but also the ordinary servicemen and the general public. Founded as the BIA Hospital, the hospital was renamed as the Public General Hospital of Rangoon on 1 November 1942, and placed under the Ministry of Health.Myint Swe 2014: 97 One constant headache for Ba Than was Japanese surveillance and interference. The hospital operated under the watchful eye of Japanese agents, who planted themselves as longterm patients till the end.Myint Swe 2014: 162–163 However, the bigger issue for the staff was the constant disruption by the Japanese troops from the nearby barracks, who would barge in and mistreat patients and staff, nurses in particular. Ba Than himself was interrogated by the soldiers on a whim.(Myint Swe 2014: 138–139): One day, two Japanese servicemen (not officers) barged in and brought Ba Than out of the classroom in which he was teaching, sat him down in a chair, and interrogated him as to why the barracks were not receiving enough water. According to Myint Swe, the Burmese students and staff were all humiliated but felt totally powerless to do anything. In 1943, the Japanese began sending doctors from the hospital to work on the Death Railway at the Thai-Burmese border, which most people took as a death sentence.Myint Swe 2014: 177 According to Myint Swe, everyone felt powerless and humiliated but no one could do anything about it.Myint Swe 2014: 138–139 What Ba Than did do was to keep his overworked staff motivated and entertained by organizing musical performances. Ba Than was an avid pianist and Burmese xylophonist, and he found time to organize small musical and opera performances by his staff for the patients. His two young children, Katie and Georgie, who were accomplished pianists, also performed at the shows.Myint Swe 2014: 66–67 The wedding of Gen. Aung San and Khin Kyi was held at the wartime hospital on 6 September 1942. The photo was taken at the easternmost hall of the hospital.Myint Swe 2014: 94 The hospital was the place where historically important people were treated, including Aung San, Ne Win, Bo Letya, Bo Setkya, Thakin Than Tun, Thakin Mya, Thakin Po Hla Gyi, Ba Cho, Kyaw Nyein, S. C. Bose, and J. R. Bhonsle.Myint Swe 2014: xxi–xxii It was also the place where Gen. Aung San met his future wife Khin Kyi during his brief hospitalization in mid 1942. Ba Than organized the wedding reception at the hospital, and even gave a song-and-piano performance.(Myint Swe 2014: 55): Ba Than played the piano and sang the inaugural wedding song called \\"Thet Wai\\" (သက်ဝေ), a prewar hit by Pyi Hla Pe and May Shin. Wartime medical and nursing schools Ba Than also restarted the country's medical and nursing schools in 1943. The schools were to address the severe staff shortage throughout the country, including the Burmese military, which had only a skeleton medical staff. Although the hospital had attracted more physicians and nurses by November 1942, the patient load had also increased even faster.Myint Swe 2014: 104 Ba Than recruited a few specialists/professors (Drs. Asahi, Suji, Horibe, and Shikuma) directly from Japan to join the hospital and the medical school.Myint Swe 2014: 135 Even then, the wartime school could offer only an accelerated two and a half year LSMP (Licensed Surgery and Medical Practitioner) program, not a full-fledged MBBS program. (The school's entire inaugural graduating class of June 1944 was drafted by the Burmese Army. The next class graduated in December 1944.Myint Swe 2014: 192) The nursing school's classes were held in the evening at the hospital and were taught initially by two senior nurses (Mi Mi Gyi and Tin Nu), and later by the graduates of the program. The program was overseen by Drs. Ba Than, Sen, and Yin May, who also graded exam papers.Myint Swe 2014: 105–106 Post- WWII Tin Tut in London, 1947 After Allied forces returned to Rangoon in May 1945, Ba Than was repeatedly questioned by the British as to why he stayed behind and cooperated with the Japanese. In the end, the British reprimanded Ba Than only for the terrible conditions at the hospital, which they shut down in July 1945.Myint Swe 2014: 230–231 The British also restarted RMC as the Faculty of Medicine of Rangoon University in 1946, installing Dr. W. Burridge as its first dean, and later Col. Dr. Min Sein (husband of Dr. Yin May) in 1947.Khin Thet-Hta et al 2005: 11 (Ba Than would not be dean until after the British left in 1948.) Nonetheless, Ba Than was the \\"top surgeon\\" in the country by then. He is remembered for his autopsies of famous politicians (many of whom were assassinated). He led the autopsies of Gen. Aung San and other cabinet officials who were assassinated on 19 July 1947, and later testified at the trial of the plotters.Maung Maung 2012: 44 The assassinated nine are commemorated each year on Martyrs' Day in the country. In September 1948, he performed the post-mortem of Tin Tut, the first Foreign Minister of the newly independent country. Tin Tut had survived the July 1947 assassination but did not survive the second attempt. (Ba Than also did the post-mortem of Po Hla Gyi in 1943.Myint Swe 2014: 137–138) Lanmadaw campus, Institute of Medicine 1, Rangoon After independence, Ba Than increasingly focused on expanding medical education in the country. From 1948 onwards, he and Min Sein took turns being the dean of the medical school for the next 11 years. Ba Than served three terms: 1948–1949, 1951–1953, and 1955–1957 while Min Sein served three more: 1949–1951, 1953–1955, and 1957–1959, (in addition to his 1947–1948 term before independence.) Ba Than also served as the head of the Department of Surgery from 1947 to 1959; he was succeeded by one of his wartime hospital colleagues, Dr. Kyee Paw.UM1 Surgery 2020 Ba Than was instrumental in starting a medical school in Mandalay, serving as the first dean of the Faculty of Medicine of Mandalay University from 1960 to 1963.(Khin Thet-Hta et al 2005: 12): The Faculty of Medicine of Mandalay University was founded in 1958 but its first official rector, Ba Than, started only in 1960. Ba Than finished out his long career in Rangoon. In 1964, the 69-year-old became the first rector of the Institute of Medicine 1, Rangoon which had just been carved out of Rangoon University as an independent institution. According to his former students, the professor was still preaching about the importance of zwe (perseverance) to his students,(Myint Swe 2014: 258): Ba Than liked to give his favorite advice by deliberately spelling out the Burmese word ဇွဲ (zwe) as \\"za-gwe wa-swe nauppyit, zwe\\", (p-e-r-s-e-v-e-r-a-n-c-e!).\\" and organizing musical troupes and shows at the school in which he would perform a song about zwe. In his free time, he served as a consultant surgeon at East Rangoon General Hospital well into his 70s. The rector retired on 30 August 1971, and died nine weeks later on 4 November 1971. He was 76. For his services to the country, he was awarded the title of Thiri Pyanchi by the Burmese government.(Burma Research Society 1967: 63): He was already a Thiri Pyanchi in 1967. Personal life Khin May Than (3rd from left) with Gen. Ne Win (4th from left) in Beijing on a state visit to China, 1965 Although best known for his driven nature, Ba Than had other interests. He loved music, and liked playing the piano and the pattala in his free time.(Myint Swe 2014: 232): According to Myint Swe, during the Japanese era, Ba Than used to sing the song \\"Shwe Zabe-Yon\\" (ရွှေစံပယ်ရုံ) in his free time. (Myint Swe 2014: 66): He also performed the \\"Asia Youth\\" song at the wartime hospital in his formal traditional Burmese attire. According to historian Robert Taylor, Ba Than was a \\"bon vivant known to enjoy the Turf Club and sports, as well as ladies\\".Taylor 2015: 165 He was married to Khin Kyi, (not Khin Kyi the wife of Gen.

She was the daughter of the rich farmer and parliamentarian Johannes Jansson i Ellenö. In 1857, she married the rich farmer and parliamentarian Magnus Andersson i Stigen, and settled in his estate in Stigen in Dalsland. In 1859, the poverty among the peasantry inspired her to found a textile enterprise in the form of a putting-out system, which could give poor women of the peasantry a way of earning money. The Swedish famine of 1867–1869 and the great need for work caused her enterprise to expand from philanthropy to a major business: she also managed her own weaving school in connection to this: one of her employees and students being the later famous Johanna Brunsson. In 1874, the business was formally transformed into a firm: because she was a married woman and therefore under the guardianship of her husband, the firm was named after him, although the business was under her personal management. She managed the firm until 1890 when she retired and gave the management over to her sons. In 1891, she founded a private mental hospital, where the principle was to allow the patients to be active in light work for a meaningful life rather than just to have them locked up, which was at that time common, and she expanded it to include a series of hospitals. While her spouse was conservative, she was a liberal and engaged in the National Association for Women's Suffrage (Sweden) and the Temperance movement.

It's part of the Cascade Range and is situated within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, on land managed by Mount Baker- Snoqualmie National Forest. Mount Roosevelt is set above the western shore of Snow Lake, and immediately north of Kaleetan Peak, which is its nearest higher neighbor. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Snoqualmie River. This mountain's name was officially adopted in 1989 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. Climate Mount Roosevelt is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The elevation range of this area is between about in the lower elevations to over on Mount Stuart. Mt. Roosevelt (left) and Kaleetan Peak (right) from Bandera Mountain Mount Roosevelt in autumn The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada–US border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

Early life  Kent Ford was born in 1943 near Maringouin, Louisiana. At the age of 12 he moved to Redmond, California with his three siblings, mother, and her husband. At the age of 18 he had his first brush with police in California when he was arrested and jailed for three days for going 60 mph in a 45 mph zone. Shortly after he moved to Portland, Oregon in 1961. Here he setup a candy business buying supplies wholesale and having adolescents sell door-to-door.  Later life  In 1967 he took a job at Safeway as a computer operator for 104 stores. The same year he returned home to find he'd been robbed, and he subsequently called the police because $1,000 was missing. When the police filed their report, it wasn't about the robbery, but instead about \\"possible subversive subject\\" - which referred to Kent Ford, who at the time had large maps of Vietnam and Cambodia in his home and writings by Mao Tse-Tung. Several weeks later Ford intervened while police were arresting a man, and was subsequently arrested, assaulted, and held in jail on $80,000 bail on charges that he had incited a riot. He was eventually acquitted and awarded a $6,000 settlement. Ford has three sons, James, Sekou, and Lumumba. Kent Ford at a demonstration at Reed College in June 2020. In 2020, Ford participated in protests against police brutality in Portland, Oregon.  Founding the Portland chapter of the Black Panther Party  In 1968, after the shooting of Martin Luther King, Jr., a group of 20 Black young adults in Portland started regularly meeting to discuss the writings of Malcolm X and other activist writers; not more than a year later, in June of 1969, Kent Ford was beaten and jailed for these activities. After Ford's release from jail he organized a press conference on the steps of Portland Central Precinct, then at SW Second & Oak, and proclaimed, \\"If they keep coming in with these fascist tactics we're going to defend ourselves.\\" Shortly thereafter Huey Newton invited him to form and lead a Portland chapter of the Black Panther party. Approximately six members of the reading group formed Portland's chapter. In total, the initial Portland Panthers had approximately 50 members, half of whom were women. One of the requirements of the Black Panther party in Portland was that members read at least two hours a day. The Portland Black Panther Party was active in demonstrations against the Vietnam War. They created a children's breakfast program and fed hundreds of children daily in the dining room at Highland United Church of Christ in Northeast Portland. The chapter also opened and operated two medical clinics in Portland, The Malcom X Dental Clinic and Fred Hampton Memorial People’s Health Clinic . As of 2020, Ford was active giving historic Black Panther walking tours about six times a year.

Within a few years Mrs Bee was advertising that she was taking young ladies for classes in French, Italian, music and other subjects at their home in Norwood. In 1855 Bee joined the South Australian civil service as a clerk with the Emigration department, handling the settlement of large numbers of single female immigrants, mostly from Ireland. It had been anticipated that they would fill the pressing need for domestic servants, but those sent out by the Emigration Commissioners were mostly unskilled and uneducated and more interested in finding husbands than in working for a living. This practice largely ceased in 1856, and Bee was appointed Relieving Officer with the Adelaide Destitute Asylum. The duties of this position included investigation of the applicants for public assistance and prosecution of those supplicants found to have concealed assets or relations who could have provided support.

Opened in 1996, it is currently located at the W Building on Rue Mar Geries in the southern Beirut suburb of Hadeth, part of the Baabda District in the Mount Lebanon Governorate. History Although the Philippines and Lebanon established diplomatic relations in 1946, the Philippines did not establish an embassy in Lebanon until November 1996, with Fortunato Oblena becoming the country's first resident ambassador. Prior to the establishment of the Embassy, the Philippines conducted diplomatic relations with Lebanon through an honorary consulate in Beirut which, at various points in its history, was accredited to the Philippine Embassies in Cairo and Amman. Initially located at Raouché in Ras Beirut, the Embassy moved to a larger space in Achrafieh in 2006, enabling it to consolidate consular and labor functions under one roof. In 2012, it moved to its current location outside the city: a new building which also enables it to host larger events. Between 1996 and 2008, the Embassy also exercised jurisdiction over Syria, until a separate embassy was established in Damascus which formally opened on April 17, 2009. Staff and activities The Philippine Embassy in Beirut is provisionally headed by a chargé d'affaires, pending the appointment of a new ambassador by the Philippine government. The current chargé d'affaires is Ajeet-Victor S. Panemanglor, while the last resident ambassador was Bernardita L. Catalla, who was appointed to the position by President Rodrigo Duterte on March 13, 2017. Prior to becoming Ambassador, Catalla, a career diplomat, had headed the Philippine Consulate General in Hong Kong, with a strong record of championing the welfare of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) throughout her career. Her appointment was confirmed by the Commission on Appointments on May 17, 2017, and she presented her credentials to Lebanese President Michel Aoun on January 4, 2018. Catalla died while in office on April 2, 2020 due to COVID-19 amidst a pandemic of the disease. The Embassy's activities center around providing to the many OFWs in Lebanon, which began on November 7, 2000 with the opening of a Filipino Workers’ Resource Center to help provide legal aid to OFWs in the country. The treatment of OFWs in Lebanon is a regular point of contention for the Embassy and for the DFA in general: in 2005, it protested a raid in Beirut conducted by the Lebanese government against OFWs despite them being legally documented, while in 2011, it went so far as to encourage people to not go to the country for work. In 2017, in one of Catalla's first acts as ambassador, the registration of Filipinos in Lebanon was swiftly resumed after it was discovered that the Embassy had not been keeping track of how many Filipinos were in the country — by the following year, more than 12,000 OFWs were registered and given registration cards. The Embassy has also facilitated the repatriation of Filipinos affected by war and other conflicts in Lebanon, which it did in 2006, and in 2019, which Catalla personally led. This has also extended to facilitating the evacuation of Filipinos from Syria as a result of that country's civil war.

Annals and Magazine of Natural History. (9) 16: 633-653. It is found in the south-western Amazon basin, from Brazil to Peru and Bolivia. The habitat consists of sandy rainforests. The larvae are gregarious and feed on species in the Passiflora subgenera Astrophea and Mitostemma. Full-grown larvae have a yellow body with black bands and a black head. They reach a length of about 20 mm. Adult H. eratosignis are distinguished morphologically from their sister species Heliconius demeter because they lack a yellow streak on the base of the forewing costa underside; in contrast, H. eratosignis has a solid orange basal costal margin on the underside of the forewing. Keith S. Brown and Woodruff W. Benson in 1975 argued the two forms were the same species, but recorded both H. eratosignis gregarious and H. demeter solitary larvae in their paper.Brown, K.

History  Prior to the tranvia, modes of street transportation in Manila are mostly horse-drawn, consisting of the calesa, the lighter carromata, and the fancy caruaje. The tranvia served as the first railway transport to run in the Philippines, as in its earliest years the Ferrocarril de Manila-Dagupan are in its planning stages. The tranvia was renowned as \\"state-of-the-art\\" in East Asia, and had provided efficient transport to the residents of Manila.  Compañia de los Tranvías de Filipinas  Steam-powered tranvia plying the Malabon Line. Plans for a tramway system came from the Formularios para la reducion de los anteproyectos de ferrocarriles, the same decree in 1875 that sparked the planning for the Ferrocarril de Manila-Dagupan. This was prepared by the Administracion de Obras Publicas to set construction conditions for potential railroad builders, from earlier railway regulations which utilizes animal power. In 1882, a tramway company venture was founded by Jacobo Zóbel y Zangroniz, engineer Luciano M. Bremon, and banker Adolfo Bayo in line with Manila's growing populace, and thus construction for the tramway commenced. The first constructed tranvia line connected Manila to Malabon in 1884 and at the same time, this was opened to the public. The line proved to be a commercial success—both by estimation and usage—with a greater profit than wheeled traffic. The tramway provided a cheap, safe, and convenient means of transport within the city until the ouster of the Spanish regime by the US when tram services dwindled in maintenance and capacity.  Manila Electric, Rail, and Light Company  The United States established its governance in the Philippines in 1901. In the following year, a commission that called for franchise bids in operating a streetcar system alongside management of electricity was passed by five Americans and three Filipinos on October 20, 1902, known as Act No. 484. When Charles M. Swift won the bid for the Manila Electric Company franchise on March 24, 1903, he commissioned J. J. White for services in construction and engineering an electric tramway, and sometime in the following year, the Manila Electric Company acquired the Compañia de los Tranvías de Filipinas and the La Electricista. In 1913, under Swift's other franchise of \\"Manila Suburban Railway\\", a extension line that ran from Paco to Fort Mckinley and Pasig began operation. This franchise merged with the Manila Electric, Rail, and Light Company in 1919, when it was then shortened to the familiar branding, Meralco. The tramway was then be powered by a steam power plant in Isla Provisora. On April 5, 1905, the tranvia was inaugurated. Although the terminology \\"streetcar\\" was favored by the American operators, locals still referred to the light railway as \\"tranvia\\". After the events of World War II and the Battle of Manila, the tranvia was left to a state of beyond economical repair. The tracks has since been dismantled, the remaining fleet scrapped, and the transport system within the metro shifted to automobile dependence and jeepneys. Meralco has since been the sole electricity provider for Metro Manila and nearby provinces up to this date.  Rolling stock  Throughout its existence, the tranvia utilized trams that differed mainly on propulsion. Under Spanish ownership, the tramway was noted for its horse-drawn coaches (tranvia de sangre), and under American rule, Meralco replaced the need for animal power by electrifying the tramways. All rolling stock ran on standard gauge light rail.  Steam-powered trams  Steam-powered trams ran exclusively through the Malabon Line. The first fleet in the whole tranvia system and by propulsion consisted of four German-made light rail locomotives and eight passenger coaches.  Horse-drawn carriages  Towards the end of the 19th century, Manila saw wheeled traffic powered by horses. As the popular power for land-based transport at that time, the secretary wrote that the Spanish tramway company was plagued with eccentric problems, mostly concerning the horses that pull the light rail coaches. Each tram can carry 12 seated and 8 standing passengers, resembling an omnibus.  Electrified trams  American ownership of the tramway under Meralco paved way for electrification, as the company also specializes on electricity distribution. The company designs and produces its own rolling stock in its workshops, and the maximum fleet of electricity-powered streetcars reached a total of 170 in 1924. The streetcars utilize an overhead electrification system with a maximum of 500 volts. Meralco also tinkered with trackless trolley buses, which subsequently replaced the streetcars plying Calle Santa Mesa between Rotonda and the San Juan Bridge.  Operations  A tranvia along the Puente de España. The bridge was now replaced by the Jones Bridge. The tramway system began construction in 1885 as an enterprise of Don Jacobo Zobel, the Compañia de los Tranvías de Filipinas. The Malabon Line was first to be accomplished in 1888, utilizing eight passenger coaches and four German- manufactured steam locomotives. Full operations opened in 1889 with the addition of lines serving Intramuros, Malate, Sampaloc, and Malacañan within Manila. Unlike the Malabon Line, the trams that serviced within Manila are pulled by horses. The tramway was an hourly service in each direction, owing to popular demand. At the Malabon Line, the earliest services begin 5:30 a.m. and end at 7:30 p.m. from Tondo; trips from Malabon were from 6:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m., a schedule met every hour at mornings, and every half-hour beginning at 1:30 p.m. in the afternoon. Map of the tranvia in 1905. As the aftermath of the Filipino uprising and the American conquest, the tranvia was left in a poor state; in 1902, only ten horse-drawn cars service for a day. Thus, ownership was passed under the Manila Electric, Rail, and Light Authority as Charles Swift won the bid for the streetcar operation. By the end of the year 1905, the system was inaugurated under Meralco's handling, and had around of light rail track. The streetcar system at that time connected Binondo, Escolta, San Nicolas, Tondo, Caloocan, Malabon, Quiapo, Sampaloc, Santa Mesa, San Miguel, and other areas within Metro Manila. Under the American ownership, the light railroad workers are mostly Filipino. The tramway system gained line extensions, such as a line that runs from Santa Ana to Pasig, adding of railway length. Larger streetcars of double-wheel trucks and closed sides are added to the fleet, complementing the demand. In 1920, a five-year reconstruction program was undertaken for the 15-year old tramway, where newer streetcars are designed and manufactured by the company workshops; by 1924, the fleet consists of around 170 cars. Complementing Meralco's transportation businesses, autobuses are added in services as a streetcar system expansion was deemed \\"not economically viable\\". In 1927, 20 autobuses were manufactured. When World War II began in 1941, the streetcar fleet was reduced from 170 to 109 as the bus fleet was expanded to 190. The war was the major setback for Meralco for its transportation business, causing poor maintenance alongside the 1943 floods, including the Battle of Manila which saw the extensive destruction of the city of Manila and consequently, the streetcar system.  Incidents  The horse-drawn coaches and the signalling often results to confusion, mostly from wrong handling of the animals, the tram failing to stop, or that of the whistle used by the Guardia Sibil tends to be taken as a signal which are replaced with trumpets. Despite the tranvia's notable patronage, operations had been marred with issues such as occasional strikes by Meralco streetcar workers. A streetcar bombing incident once occurred while a strike was ongoing.  Future  There had been plans to revive the tranvia. In 2019, a consortium led by Greenergy Holdings Inc. aimed to invest an amount close to $500 million in building a tram system along of the service road on Roxas Boulevard. This follows a route plied by the original tramway during the early 1900s. Under a joint venture agreement, the arrangement projects the tramway to serve as a passenger feeder to the Makati Intra-city Subway project.  Light Rail Transit Line 1  The contemporary LRT–1, constructed in 1980, has a right of way that closely follows the tranvia's right-of-way somewhere from Manila going south to Pasay.

Critical response In his 2003 book A Century of Canadian Cinema, Gerald Pratley called the film \\"a low-budget fairy-tale romp and a welcome change from other films claiming to be comedies\\". Writing for the Toronto Star, Mitchel Raphael positioned Levy alongside LaBruce, playwright Brad Fraser and novelist Todd Klinck as one of a wave of \\"new degenerates\\" whose work challenged rather than assimilating into the \\"gay establishment\\".Mitchel Raphael, \\"The new degenerates: An eclectic wave of movies, books and plays is challenging the gay establishment\\". Toronto Star, October 18, 1997. Thomas Waugh's MediaQueer site describes the film as a \\"Candide-style parable\\" which \\"somehow missed entering the Canadian canon, perhaps because the fresh, folksy but sex-savvy satire of innocence adrift was hard to pigeonhole as either queer or otherwise, or because the Egoyan-Cronenberg tastemakers prefer to keep our frothy comic sensibilities on television and reserve the Art Cinema for world- heavy themes.\\"Joshua Levy\\".

In 1985, Philadelphia Mayor Wilson Goode and police commissioner Gregore J. Sambor had classified MOVE as a terrorist organization and police obtained arrest warrants against MOVE members for various crimes. The standoff started after the Philadelphia police evacuated nearby houses and attempted to serve eviction notices and execute arrest warrants. Eleven people in the house, including five children, died in the fire, and 65 homes in the neighborhood were destroyed. One of the two MOVE survivors from the fire, claimed that police fired at those escaping the fire. The Philadelphia Commission found that the law enforcement and fire department actions were negligent, but no criminal charges were filed. Incident In 1981, MOVE relocated to a row house at 6221 Osage Avenue in the Cobbs Creek area of West Philadelphia. Neighbors complained to the city for years about trash around their building, confrontations with neighbors, and bullhorn announcements of sometimes obscene political messages by MOVE members. The bullhorn was broken and inoperable for the three weeks prior to the police bombing of the row house. The police obtained arrest warrants in 1985 charging four MOVE occupants with crimes including parole violations, contempt of court, illegal possession of firearms, and making terrorist threats. Mayor Wilson Goode and police commissioner Gregore J. Sambor classified MOVE as a terrorist organization. Police evacuated residents of the area from the neighborhood prior to their action. Residents were told that they would be able to return to their homes after a twenty-four hour period. On Monday, May 13, 1985, nearly five hundred police officers, along with city manager Leo Brooks, arrived in force and attempted to clear the building and execute the arrest warrants. Water and electricity were shut off in order to force MOVE members out of the house. Commissioner Sambor read a long speech addressed to MOVE members that started with, \\"Attention MOVE: This is America. You have to abide by the laws of the United States.\\" When the MOVE members did not respond, the police decided to forcibly remove the 13 members from the house, which consisted of eight adults and five children. There was an armed standoff with police,Account of 1985 incident from USA Today. who lobbed tear gas canisters at the building. The MOVE members fired at them, and a gunfight with semi-automatic and automatic firearms ensued. Police used more than ten thousand rounds of ammunition before Commissioner Sambor ordered that the compound be bombed. From a Pennsylvania State Police helicopter, Philadelphia Police Department Lt. Frank Powell proceeded to drop two one-pound (0.5 kg) bombs (which the police referred to as \\"entry devices\\") made of FBI-supplied Tovex, a dynamite substitute, targeting a fortified, bunker-like cubicle on the roof of the house. The ensuing fire killed eleven of the people in the house (John Africa, five other adults, and five children aged 7 to 13). The fire spread and eventually destroyed approximately sixty-five nearby houses. Although firefighters had earlier drenched the building prior to the bombing, after the fire broke out, officials said they feared that MOVE would shoot at the firefighters, so held them back. Goode later testified at a 1996 trial that he had ordered the fire to be put out after the bunker had burned. Sambor said he received the order, but the fire commissioner testified that he did not receive the order. Ramona Africa, one of the two MOVE survivors from the house, said that police fired at those trying to escape.  Aftermath  Goode appointed an investigative commission called the Philadelphia Special Investigation Commission (PSIC, aka MOVE Commission), chaired by William H. Brown, III. Sambor resigned in November 1985; in a speech the following year, he said that he was made a \\"surrogate\\" by Goode. The MOVE Commission issued its report on March 6, 1986. The report denounced the actions of the city government, stating that \\"Dropping a bomb on an occupied row house was unconscionable.\\" Following the release of the report, Goode made a formal public apology. No one from the city government was criminally charged in the attack. The only surviving adult MOVE member, Ramona Africa, was charged and convicted on charges of riot and conspiracy; she served seven years in prison. In 1996, a federal jury ordered the city to pay a $1.5 million civil suit judgment to survivor Ramona Africa and relatives of two people killed in the bombing. The jury had found that the city used excessive force and violated the members' constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure. In 1985 Philadelphia was given the sobriquet \\"The City that Bombed Itself\\". In 2005, federal judge Clarence Charles Newcomer presided over a civil trial brought by residents seeking damages for having been displaced by the widespread destruction following the 1985 police bombing of MOVE. A jury awarded them a $12.83 million verdict against the City of Philadelphia.Douglas Martin (August 28, 2005). \\"CLARENCE NEWCOMER, 82, LONGTIME FEDERAL JUDGE,\\" South Florida Sun Sentinel.

While she did not become an ace, she made it through Battle of Stalingrad unlike many of her colleagues transferred there.Женские авиаполки. История. Факты. Лица.  Civilian life  Kuznetsova was born on 4 April 1918 to a Russian peasant family in Yazvishchi village. She began flying when she was 18, but her father was arrested during the Red Terror in 1937, forcing her to note the arrest in applications and documents, resulting in her being kicked out of flight training several times for being related to an \\"enemy of the people\\"; however, her friends spoke up on her behalf and managed to convince the head of the flight school to let her stay. After the war she married Vladimir Pavlovich Zhukotsky, commander of the 802nd Fighter Aviation Regiment.  World War II  After transferring to the Red Army from Osoviahim in October 1941 she began training at Engels Military Aviation School until she was deployed to defend important structures in Saratov from German bombers with the 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment. In September 1942 she was transferred to the 437th Fighter Aviation Regiment with Yekaterina Budanova, Lydia Litvyak, and Raisa Belyaeva; the reasons for the transfer are disputed among historians, ranging from the need for experienced pilots in the battle of Stalingrad to Tamara Kazarinova wanting to get rid of the pilots who complained about her. In a postwar interview with Anne Noggle she claimed to have shot down three enemy aircraft, including a Ju-87 and Ju-88, but there is no confirmation of this in her award sheets or regiment documents. It is confirmed that she flew over 100 sorties, providing cover for strategically valuable targets and escorting Li-2 transport aircraft. After serving with the predominantly male fighter aviation regiment in Stalingrad she did not want to return to her original unit, the 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment, because it was an air defense unit that saw less intense combat; however, she was forced to do so under threat of tribunal, despite complaining that she wouldn't be \\"deserting\\" to the reserve but to the frontlines. During the war she was featured alongside Litvyak and Budanova in the military aviation newspaper Stalinsky Sokol.Газета «Сталинский сокол» от 13 ноября 1942 года  Awards  * Two Order of the Patriotic War 2nd class (21 February 1944 and 1985) * Order of the Red Star (28 September 1944) * campaign and jubilee medals  References =Bibliography * Category:1918 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Soviet women in World War II Category:Soviet World War II pilots Category:Recipients of the Order of the Patriotic War, 2nd class ","title":"Mariya Kuznetsova (pilot)"},{"id":"64334912","text":"Peter Williams (1915–2003) was an American-born British film and television actor.

Structure and history The Hong Kong Defence Force was established on 19 January 1942, following the Japanese victory during the Battle of Hong Kong in December 1941. The 38th Division, which had been the main Imperial Japanese Army unit responsible for capturing the British colony, departed the same month. The Hong Kong Defence Force reported to the Japanese Government of the Hong Kong Occupied Territory. The other Japanese military units stationed in Hong Kong from early 1942 were the small Hong Kong Artillery Force and the Imperial Japanese Navy's Hong Kong Base Force, which formed part of the 2nd China Expeditionary Fleet. The Hong Kong Defence Force had a similar structure to the Imperial Japanese Army's Independent Mixed Brigades, which were also initially established to occupy Japanese-held territory. Its main elements were three infantry battalions, the 67th, 68th and 69th Independent Infantry Battalions. These battalions were supported by an artillery unit which comprised six anti-aircraft guns, a trench mortar battery and two field artillery batteries. The Hong Kong Defence Force also had a hospital. The authorised strength was 106 officers and 3,028 enlisted men. This structure remained unchanged until the force's disbandment following the end of the war. The three infantry battalions were stationed at Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories. The battalions in Kowloon and the New Territories operated in urban areas, along the Kowloon-Canton Railway and at four posts. The size of the Hong Kong Defence Force proved too small, and a detachment of 250 soldiers from the Twenty-Third Army was also stationed in Hong Kong.

Golden king crabs are primarily found in the Aleutian Islands and waters nearer to Alaska and British Columbia; their range also extends to the Russian far east and Japan, albeit with a less dense population. Golden king crabs are the smallest of the three commercially viable Alaskan king crab species with an average weight between 5 and 8 lbs(2.3 - 3.6 kg); the other two species being the blue and red king crabs. Golden king crabs were historically caught incidentally in red king crab fisheries, but the first commercial landing took place in 1975; in 1981, the targeted pot-fishing method, a hybrid fishing method specifically for golden king crab, was developed.  Description  The golden king crab is a North Pacific king crab, a decapod crustacean. They have five pairs of legs, the front pair carries their claws. Golden king crabs get their name form the orange-brown to golden hue of their shells, which are mostly made of calcium. Like other king crabs, golden king crabs are large and have long, spiny legs; compared with blue and red king crabs, though, they are smaller by a great deal, with a typical weight between 5 and 8 lb, and notably thinner legs. The golden king crab also has a distinctive carapace, which typically has five to nine spines on the mid-dorsal plate. Unrelated to their size, golden king crabs generally have the lowest meat-fill in proportion to their bodies compared with other Alaskan king crabs. They also have a fan-shaped tail flap located on the rear and underside of their bodies; adult female crabs brood embryos underneath their tail flaps. Although L. aequispinus may be referred to as either \\"golden king crab\\" or \\"brown king crab\\", the US Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 Food and Drugs part 102 section 102.50 declared that the appropriate market name for its producct is “brown king crabmeat”, but as of November 2017. this was overridden by section 774 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, which established the proper market name as “golden king crabmeat”. Manufactures and sellers of products containing L. aequispinus were granted until January 1, 2020, to make the appropriate change to product labels.  Distribution and habitat  The primary range of the golden king crab is around the Aleutian Islands and waters surrounding southern Alaska and British Columbia, as well as the Russian far east and Japan to a lesser degree. Substantial Alaskan populations of golden king crabs occur off of the Pribilof and Shumagin Islands, Shelikof Strait, Prince William Sound, and the lower Chatham Strait in Southeastern Alaska. Golden king crabs typically inhabit waters ranging from 300 to 1000 meters in depth. They usually avoid open sand substrates, instead favoring complex sloping and rocky habitats, often relying on boulders or structure forming sessile invertebrates such as coral or sponges for habitat. Adult golden king crabs exhibit an annual deep and back migratory pattern during which they travel to shallow waters in the late winter to molt and mate. This is followed by a return to deeper waters, where they feed and exist for most of the year. Golden king crabs often occupy deeper waters than red king crabs; within their geographical range they are the most abundant species of crab.  Reproduction and lifecycle  Golden king crabs exhibit 20-month asynchronous reproductive cycles during which female crabs typically brood 10,000 to 30,000 eggs underneath their fan-shaped tail flaps for roughly a year. Golden king crabs have the largest eggs of the three commercially viable king crab species. Offspring emerge as swimming larvae, but are weak and susceptible to underwater currents. Throughout their transformation into adulthood, golden king crabs undergo several physical transformations via molting. Offspring eventually settle at the bottom of the ocean in waters with a usual minimum depth of 300 ft. Golden king crabs are typically classified as juveniles in their first few years. After reaching sexual maturity around 4 to 5 years of age, they are classified as adults. Golden king crabs molt throughout their entire lives, and juveniles do so more frequently than adults. Due to reproductive necessity, females molt more often then their male counterparts, which can keep their shells for one to two years at a time. Throughout their lives, golden king crabs exhibit an annual offshore “deep and back” migrational pattern, which involves male and female crabs arriving in shallow water in late winter and early spring to molt their shells and mate. When embryos hatch in late spring, they then leave into deeper waters for feeding, wherein they are not typically found with crabs of the opposite sex nor with red or blue king crabs. Golden king crabs consume a wide variety of species, including worms, clams, mussels, snails, sea stars, urchins, sand dollars, barnacles, algae, sponges, and even other crabs and crustaceans. Many crabs have a strong sense of smell; the golden king crab uses this to locate food. Golden king crabs are also preyed on by various fishes such as Pacific cod, halibut, and yellowfin sole, as well as sea otters. Nemertean worms have also been found to consume the embryos of golden king crabs.  Fisheries  Due to their small size, golden king crabs are not as popular as blue or red king crab, but they are widely fished throughout Alaska, particularly in the Aleutian Islands. In comparison with other commercially viable king crabs, golden king crabs are noted as being similar in flavor, but perhaps milder and sweeter. To protect the golden king crab stock in Alaska, several regulations have been established. Crab fishermen may only catch and harvest males of a legal size, that being 7 cm or larger laterally across the carapace. Fishing also must not coincide with mating and molting periods. After the North Pacific Council approved stock assessments of golden king crab, state managers were allowed the authority to increased crab fishing quotas by the Alaska Board of Fish. As of 2015, in coordination with the industry, the state has conducted numerous surveys of golden king crab stock. As of August 2018, quotas for golden king crab fishing rose for the first time in 20 years. This allowed the taking of 3.9 million pounds of golden king crab east of Adak island, and 2.5 million pounds west of Adak, increases of 18 and 11%, respectively. In the following season, as of August 2019, quotas for golden king crab harvest were again increased, allowing 4.3 million pounds to be taken east of Atka island, and 2.9 million west of Atka. The raised quota represented respective increases of 12 and 15% since the previous season. The 2019 golden king crab season is the second for which the government's new stock assessment model was used. The new stock assessment model determines seasonal crab stock more thoroughly than previous methods and is unique to golden king crab.

She has earned recognition for her books for children and youth, particularly her historical fiction and non-fiction works about African-American history. Four of her books have been named to the honor list of the Coretta Scott King Awards, presented by the American Library Association.  Life  Hansen was born in the Bronx, New York City on October 18, 1942. Her parents were Austin Victor, a photographer, and Lilian Dancy Hansen. She earned a bachelor's degree in English from Pace University (1972) and a master's degree in English from New York University (1978). For 22 years, she worked as a teacher in New York City public schools, before retiring in 1995.  Fiction  Hansen has said that her writing is motivated by a drive to increase interest in reading among her students and others who are underrepresented in children's literature. Her first novel was The Gift- Giver (1980), about a group of friends living in the Bronx. She wrote two sequels to the book, Yellow Bird and Me (1986) and One True Friend (2001). In addition to novels set in contemporary urban settings, Hansen has written a number of works of historical fiction about African-American history, including books about slavery and the Civil War. Which Way Freedom? (1986), her first work of historical fiction, was named a Coretta Scott King Honor Book. The book, about a Black teenager serving with the Union Army in the Civil War, was the first of a trilogy of books that included Out From This Place (1998) and The Heart Calls Home (1999). Her novels The Captive (1994) and I Thought My Soul Would Rise and Fly: The Diary of Patsy, a Freed Girl (part of the Dear America series of books) were also named Coretta Scott King Honor Books.  Non-fiction  Hansen has also written a number of non-fiction books for youth about African-American and African history. Women of Hope: African Americans Who Made A Difference (1998) features short biographies of thirteen influential Black women, including neurosurgeon Alexa Canady, astronaut Mae Jemison, and activist Fannie Lou Hamer. Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"inspirational\\" and \\"effective as art and as history\\". With Gary McGowan, Hansen wrote Breaking Ground, Breaking Silence: The Story of New York's African Burial Ground (1998). The book, which was named a Coretta Scott King Honor Book, detailed the 1991 discovery and excavation of a burial ground for slaves and free blacks in New York City. Also with McGowan, Hansen wrote Freedom Roads (2003), a non-fiction account of the Underground Railroad, which Kirkus called \\"well-written, well-documented, imaginatively arranged\\". Hansen's 2004 book, African Princess: The Amazing Lives of Africa's Royal Women, profiles six prominent women, including Hatshepsut, Amina, and Elizabeth of Toro. A New York Times review called the book \\"[m]eticulously researched\\" and \\"rich with detail, drama and intrigue\\".

History  The medieval writers Qalqashandi and Khalil ibn Shahin al-Zahiri cited Ibyar as the capital of the province Jazirah Bani Nasr. The 14th-century writer Ibn Fadlallah al-Omari referred to Ibyar itself as the \\"Island of the Banu Nasr\\", describing it as \\"an island in the middle of the western arm of the Nile\\" and attributing its name to the tribe of the Banu Nasr, who had dominated the Nile Delta at one point before being defeated by the Berber Liwata tribe. After this defeat, the Banu Nasr had adopted a sedentary lifestyle in the area of Ibyar. At the time of the Rauk al-Nasiri, Ibyar belonged to the province of Monufia; al-Dimashqi, described Ibyar as part of the district of Tawwah. Ibn Battuta visited Ibyar during his travels in Egypt, and Qazwini described the town as a source of natron. In medieval times, Ibyar was noted for its linen industry. It produced a specialty called muḥarrar, described as \\"imitation silk\\". In 1216-17, following the death of Pope John VI of Alexandria, one of the candidates to succeed him as Coptic Pope was a monk from Ibyar, who, according to one source, had been nominated by the Ayyubid prince (and future ruler) Al-Kamil after the monk's prayers had cured him of a heart ailment. The monk was brought to Cairo before the intervention of the powerful Coptic archon Nash al-Khilafah resulted in him being sent back to his hermitage in Ibyar. Ibyar's bishopric remained active through the late thirteenth century, indicating the presence of a large Christian population at the time. Its location on the Rosetta branch of the Nile meant that residents could easily travel by boat, which was the main mode of transport in the Nile Delta. The 1303 Crete earthquake (on 8 August) devastated Ibyar, causing extensive to total collapse of the town's buildings. Modern estimates of the earthquake's ground motion at Ibyar indicate a ground displacement of 1.08 cm, a ground velocity of 0.56 cm/s, and a ground acceleration of 1.17 cm/s². Ibn Battuta recorded his visit to Ibyar, but scholars disagree as to when. Ibn Battuta himself wrote that he visited Ibyar on 31 July 1326 (29 Sha'ban in the Islamic calendar), during his first journey through Egypt, but H.A.R. Gibb claimed that this date is impossible, since he must have already been on his way to Damascus by then. Ivan Hrbek disagreed, saying that Ibn Battuta probably did visit all the places he mentioned during his first trip to Egypt, but they agreed that Ibn Batutta could not possibly have still been in Egypt on 31 July. Ross Dunn has suggested instead that he passed through Ibyar and other Nile Delta towns in April. The 1885 Census of Egypt recorded Ibyar as a nahiyah in under the district of Mahallet Menouf in Gharbia Governorate; at that time, the population of the city was 8,449 (4,421 men and 4,328 women). On 29 January 29 1954, a fire raged through Ibyar, destroying 102 houses and leaving hundreds of people homeless, drawing a visit from then-president Mohamed Naguib. During the period leading up to the 2012 Egyptian presidential election, the reformist candidate Mohamed ElBaradei resided in Ibyar.  Bagam mosque  The Jami al-Bagam, or Bagam mosque, was established as a madrasa during the Ayyubid period, in 629 AH (1231-32 CE) by Shaykh Ahmad Ridwan. It rose to become one of the most important madrasas in the Nile Delta by the early Mamluk period. A notable Sufi site, it had been built on the site of an earlier Coptic and Byzantine structure. The mosque takes its name from Shaykh Ahmad Ridwan's grandson Ahmed Bagam the Great, who oral tradition remembers as a rich landowner, and his own descendant Ahmed Bagam the Small, who continued to occupy the location. Ahmed Bagam the Great, his mother, two brothers, and Ahmed Bagam the Small were buried here around the central court. At the beginning of the 17th century, the Bagam mosque was enlarged in the Ottoman style, and the Bagam family tombs were adorned with maqsuras. In 1042 AH (1632-33 CE), the rizaq registers describe the mosque as serving as a zawiya. The Bagam family spread throughout the Delta: in Zawiyat Bimam, one Sidi Ali al-Bagam was entombed at the older mausoleum of Sidi Mas'ud al-Abdi, and other Bagams are known from Quesna and Bilqas. In the 19th century, control the mosque passed into the hands of the Naga family, whose members were ulama and sharifs of the Shafi'ite rite; they oversaw the sharifs of Monufia. In 1274 AH (1857-58 CE), Shaykh Ridwan Naga al-Kabir renovated the minaret and financed the current minbar of the mosque. His successor, Shaykh Abd al-Hadi Naga, was imam of the Bagam mosque under the khedives Abbas and Isma'il. He established an Islamic school at the mosque precinct. The zawiya of Ali Muhammad Naga, who died in 1930, remains one of the largest religious buildings in Ibyar.

Biography Raymundo Albano was born in Bacarra, Ilocos Norte on January 27, 1947. He studied at the Ateneo de Manila, earning a bachelor's degree in 1968 with the distinction of receiving the John Mulry Award for Literary Excellence. Shortly after, he held his first one-man exhibition at Joy T. Dayrit’s Print Gallery. He exhibited thereafter with the Luz Gallery, the ABC Galleries, and Sining Kamalig. He was named among the recipients of the first Thirteen Artists Award by the Cultural Center of the Philippines in 1970. In 1974, he won an Honorable Mention in the Tokyo Biennale of International Prints. In 1977, Albano received a grant as Artist-in-Residence under the Fulbright-Hayes Fund International Exchange of Scholars at the University of the Pacific, Stockton, California, USA. Paintings Raymundo Albano's works are often credited as precursors of conceptual art in the Philippines along with the work of his contemporary Roberto Chabet. His paintings are mostly abstractions that incorporate found objects. Several pieces are in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, the Cultural Center of the Philippines, Singapore Art Museum, and the National Museum of Fine Arts of the Philippines, aside from prestigious private collections. Curator Albano was the curator of several exhibitions showcasing the art from the Philippines such as the Philippine Collection for the Asian Art Festival held at the Fukuoka Art Museum, Japan, and the Philippine Sceneries Show in Beijing, China. Albano succeeded Roberto Chabet as Museum Director of the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) in 1970. He introduced the exhibition of multimedia works during his tenure at the CCP and also personally designed several exhibition posters. He is a founding partner of Finale Art File, one of the oldest contemporary art galleries in Manila. Poetry Ray Albano started writing poetry in the 1950s as a high school student in San Sebastian College, where he wrote for the school paper. In Ateneo he contributed poems to Heights, the university's literary journal. According to curator and scholar Patrick D. Flores, Albano is considered to be in the league of Filipino modernists, Aurelio Alvero, Hernando R. Ocampo, and David Medalla. The poet Emmanuel S. Torres wrote about Raymundo R. Albano's poetic style as \\"at once abstractive and pictorial—not as posture but as fluent assertion of a fully achieved sensibility.\\" Recognition Ray Albano is currently the subject of a number of exhibitions that examine his influential role as a pioneering artist-curator in the Philippines. He has been featured in a retrospective exhibition at the Vargas Museum in 2017 and at a special exhibition at the Art Fair Philippines in 2019. Illness and death Ray Albano suffered from frequent asthma attacks and scoliosis for most of his life and had to walk with a limp. His unusual posture earned him the monicker \\"The Quasimodo of the Cultural Center\\" which he self-mockingly referred to himself. He died in 1985 at the age of 38.

Operated by founder Michael Poole, the community functioned as a popular tourist destination as well as a place of low-cost residence and accommodation, particularly for seasonal workers working over the summer months. Residents were encouraged to participate in a hippie lifestyle, living in camp-like conditions with an emphasis on sustainability and a community culture that espoused empathy as a core value and that was highly tolerant of soft drug use. Poole's Land came to an end due to a combination of dissatisfaction by local authorities, the failing health of its founder, and the COVID-19 pandemic paralysing operations. History Founder Michael Poole Origin Poole's Land was created October 7, 1988, by Michael Poole when he purchased an forested property in the area of Tofino, a small settlement on the west coast of Vancouver Island. It cost Poole $50,000 to purchase the site, and afterwards he had little funds remaining to develop it further. In keeping with his vision of creating a \\"communal living area free from any corporate structure\\", he began to offer accommodation on the site in exchange for labour. This formed the basis of what came to emerge on the site, a \\"hippie commune\\" often labelled as \\"anarchist\\", although Poole himself considered it more of a humanist venture. In the summer of 1993 Tofino and the surrounding area was the epicentre for the Clayoquot protests, an organised environmental campaign against clearcutting in the Clayoquot Sound area of Vancouver Island. As the campaign escalated that summer, thousands of environmentalists arrived in the Tofino area to participate in the protests, many of whom came to temporarily stay on Poole's Land and helped establish its reputation and ethos. Culture If guests at Poole's Land were unable to afford to pay for accommodation at the site, they could instead volunteer their labour, such as working in a communal kitchen or in a communal garden. Labour could also be undertaken in exchange for a gift of drugs as such as cannabis, magic mushrooms or LSD, the use of which was promoted by founder Poole as \\"herbal medicines\\". Inversely, hard narcotics such as cocaine and heroin were shunned by Poole and the community as destructive and addictive. One custom maintained by the camp was that the recruitment of a new resident to the commune would be celebrated by the smoking of cannabis from a peace pipe. Residents cited the tolerant culture of the camp as one of the main benefits of living at the site. Community Manager Michael Goodlife suggested the longevity of Poole's Land over similar communal living communities was due to the community not taking itself too seriously and emphasising the fun of living in the alternative lifestyle of the camp, as well as stating that he felt the camp's overall central philosophy was simply \\"empathy\\" and \\"taking care of the person next to you\\". Poole's Land practised permaculture, growing some of its own food and drugs for its own communal consumption. Residents of Poole's Land lived in camp-like settings, occupying tents, wooden cabins, treehouses, or tiny homes, many placed on the back of trailers in order to abide by local Tofino housing bylaws. Even the remains of a disused school bus (known as the Magic Bus) served as a place of residence. There was no on-site plumbing, with the community making use of outhouses and composting toilets for bathroom facilities and using the nearby Pacific Ocean to wash. Poole estimated that, in any given year, during the summer months there could be as many as 100 residents living simultaneously on Poole's Land. Many Poole's Land residents were poor or even homeless as they arrived but often found work in the area as unskilled labour. Critics of Poole's Land associated the residents with criminality, but supporters suggested that the site offered some of the only affordable accommodation in the area during the summer, as all other accommodation in the town would be rented out to seasonal tourists, and thus was very important to the Tofino workforce. Many of those who sought out residency on Poole's Land also came with mental health issues, something Goodlife acknowledged but said he was committed to attempting to manage. Poole's Land was a popular destination not just for prospective residents; it was estimated that approximately 20,000 tourists passed through the site in a 30-year period, despite the remoteness of its location. Demise In 2013 founder Poole was diagnosed with prostate cancer. This, coupled with a general feeling of being \\"burnt out\\" by 30 continuous years of running the community, resulted in Poole placing the property up for sale in 2018, hoping to secure a price of $2 million to $3 million. It was Poole's ambition to use these profits to purchase a lot on nearby Long Beach in order \\"to solve the staff- accommodation problem and the homelessness\\". By 2019, local authorities had began to apply fines to Poole's Land for violating zoning bylaws, which in turn resulted in most of the permanent structures on the site having to be dismantled or destroyed. In the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic, Poole's Land was declared \\"permanently closed\\" as of March 2020. On June 25, 2020, Manisha Krishnan, a journalist from Vice magazine who had written a number of articles about Poole's Land as well as created a short documentary about it, wrote an article stating that Poole had died on June 16, 2020. He was 68 years old.

While serrated polyposis syndrome does not cause symptoms, the condition is associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). The lifelong risk of CRC is between 25 and 40%. SPS is the most common polyposis syndrome affecting the colon, but is under recognized due to a lack of systemic long term monitoring. Diagnosis requires colonoscopy, and is defined by the presence of either of two criteria: ≥5 serrated lesions/polyps proximal to the rectum (all ≥ 5 mm in size, with two lesions ≥10 mm), or >20 serrated lesions/polyps of any size distributed throughout the colon with 5 proximal to the rectum. A family history of SPS and smoking tobacco are associated with a higher risk of serrated polyposis syndrome, whereas the use of aspirin and Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) are associated with a lower risk. While there are several genetic abnormalities associated with SPS, including RNF43, BRAF, abnormal CpG island methylator phenotype, and microsatellite instability. However, most individuals with the syndrome do not have an associated germline mutation. The types of polyps found in SPS include sessile serrated adenomas/polyps, traditional serrated adenomas, and hyperplastic polyps. SPS occurs in 2 phenotypes: proximal and distal. Proximal SPS has a greater risk of CRC than distal SPS. The vast majority of cases may be managed with colonoscopy with removal polyps (polypectomy). Polyp removal is recommended to decrease the risk of colorectal cancer. Repeat colonoscopy should be performed every 1-2 years. If polyps are very large, numerous, or increase in number rapidly, then surgery may be necessary. Surgery may also be warranted if CRC is suspected or confirmed. First-degree relatives of people with SPS have an increased risk of CRC, and should undergo early screening with colonoscopy. Signs and symptoms Sessile serrated adenoma seen under microscopy with H&E; stain. Serrated polyposis syndrome often does not cause symptoms. The risk of colon cancer is between 25 and 40%. Sessile serrated polyps, as seen during endoscopy or colonoscopy, are flat (rather than raised) and are easily overlooked. Serrated lesions range in size from small (<5 mm) to large, and often have a \\"mucous cap\\" overlying the polyp. Serrated lesions are frequently located on the folds of the colon (haustral folds). Pathophysiology SPS is not caused by a single gene mutation. Several genetic abnormalities are associated with the condition, and a familial or inherited pattern may occur. Key genetic abnormalities include mutations in BRAF, abnormal CpG island methylator phenotype, and microsatellite instability. Additional implicated genes include: SMAD4, BMPR1A, PTEN, GREM1, and MUTYH. The only validated genetic cause of SPS is RNF43. However, most individuals with SPS do not have a germline mutation in any of the associated genes, including RNF43. As the underlying genetic risks for SPS are not fully understood, genetic testing is not recommended. Both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive patterns of inheritance have been reported, as well as sporadic. Individuals with SPS have serrated polyps, which include hyperplastic polyps, traditional serrated adenomas, and sessile serrated polyps. In addition to serrated polyps, adenomas are often identified. Types Traditional serrated adenoma seen under microscopy with H&E; stain, showing serrated crypts. SPS may occur with one of two phenotypes: distal or proximal. The distal phenotype may demonstrate numerous small polyps in the distal colon (sigmoid) and rectum, whereas the proximal phenotype may be characterized by relatively fewer, but larger polyps in the proximal colon (cecum, ascending colon, etc.). Individuals meeting only criterion 3 from 2010 criteria, or only criterion 2 from the 2019 classification, have a distal phenotype have a lower risk of CRC compared with the proximal phenotype. Diagnosis The diagnosis of serrated polyposis syndrome is achieved when either one of two criteria are met: ≥5 serrated lesions/polyps proximal to the rectum (all ≥ 5 mm in size, with two lesions ≥10 mm), or >20 serrated lesions/polyps of any size distributed throughout the large bowel with 5 proximal to the rectum. Any serrated polyp is counted towards the diagnosis, including sessile serrated lesions, hyperplastic polyps, and traditional serrated adenomas. In addition, the cumulative number of serrated lesions is cumulative over time and includes multiple colonoscopies. The diagnosis of SPS is often overlooked, and requires lifelong tracking of cumulative serrated polyps. Treatment Colonoscopy is the mainstay of treatment for SPS, which allows for the identification of polyps and removal. Polyp removal is recommended to prevent the development of colorectal cancer. If polyps are relatively few, then removal may be achieved with colonoscopy. After polyps are removed, repeat colonoscopy is recommended in 1 to 3 year intervals. On average, about 2.8 colonscopies are necessary to achieve control of disease. The majority of cases may be managed with colonoscopy alone. Narrow-band imaging, an imaging technique used to enhance features of mucosa seen during colonoscopy, may improve detection of serrated lesions; however, one multicenter trial did not show improved detection. If polyps are very numerous, very large, or their growth cannot be controlled with colonoscopy, then surgery may be necessary. When surgery is necessary, a total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis should be considered to minimize the risk of colon cancer. If surgery is necessary and involvement of polyps is focal or largely confined to a particular section of bowel, then segmental resection may be considered. Segmental resection is also recommended for cancer. In most cases, the rectum is left in place. Any remaining segments of colon or rectum require annual surveillance with colonoscopy. First degree relatives of people with SPS are at a higher risk of colorectal cancer and SPS. As such, these individuals should undergo screening with colonoscopy beginning at the earliest of the following: 40 years of age, the age of the youngest diagnosis of SPS in the family, or 10 years younger than the earliest CRC related to SPS. Repeat colonoscopy should be performed at 5 year intervals. Prognosis The average long term risk of colon cancer is between 15 and 30%. However, the risk of cancer varies widely and depends on age, polyp burden, phenotype and the presence of dysplasia on histology. Endoscopic surveillance can decrease the risk of progression to cancer. History Hyperplastic polyp seen under microscopy with H&E; stain. The condition was originally known as hyperplastic polyposis syndrome. When the syndrome was first recognized, only hyperplastic polyps were included in its definition, and the syndrome was believed to not be associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer. In 1996, a case series revealed an association of the syndrome with cancer and serrated adenomas. Subsequently, other types of serrated polyps were found to occur in this condition, so the name was adjusted to the present \\"serrated polyposis syndrome.\\" The World Health Organization released diagnostic criteria in 2010, which were updated in 2010 and again in 2019. The 2010 classification defined SPS as meeting any of the following criteria: 1) five or more serrated polyps proximal to the sigmoid colon with 2 larger than 10 mm in size, 2) any serrated polyps found proximal to the sigmoid colon in a person with a first-degree relative with serrated polyposis, or 3) more than 20 serrated colon polyps. The updated 2019 classification revised the first criterion to include lesions in the sigmoid colon, and excluded very small polyps (<5 mm). The updated 2019 classification also removed the criterion that included any serrated lesions proximal to the sigmoid colon in a person with a first degree relative with SPS. Epidemiology Data regarding overall prevalence of SPS is lacking, but it is estimated to occur in roughly 1 in 100,000. SPS is equally common among men and women. Most individuals with SPS are diagnosed between 40 and 60 years of age, with an average age of 55 years. Nearly half of individuals with SPS have a family member with colorectal cancer. Most individuals (37-70%) with SPS fulfill criterion 3 of the 2010 criteria (now criteria 2 from the 2019 classification). Of the remaining individuals with SPS, roughly half meet only criterion 1 and half meet both criteria 1 and 3 (2010 classification). Among individuals undergoing colonoscopy for the evaluation of an abnormal fecal occult blood test, the prevalence of SPS ranges from 0.34 to 0.66%. The overall prevalence of SPS is 0.03 - 0.5%. The prevalence of SPS is between 1 in 127 and 1 in 242 among individuals undergoing colonoscopy. SPS is associated with tobacco use. Aside from colorectal cancer, the risk of others cancers is not increased in people with SPS. Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) may be associated with a lower risk of SPS. SPS is the most common polyposis syndrome affecting the colon. There is no clear association of SPS with any cancers other than colorectal cancer. However, there is mixed evidence regarding a possible association with SPS and pancreatic cancer. Individuals with a history of lymphoma have a higher risk of developing sessile serrated polyposis syndrome.

Synopsis Wayne Archer (Allan Royal) and Jean-Claude Archambeault (Robert Lalonde) are two military officers from Canada's \\"two solitudes,\\" an Anglophone and a Francophone. A barracks room fight breaks out between the two young servicemen over whether to watch Kojak or the elections in Quebec. Shortly thereafter, they are assigned together to a remote northern radio outpost north of Goose Bay, Labrador, for three months, much to their mutual displeasure. En route, their plane crashes in a severe snow storm, killing the pilot. Archer saves Archambeault from certain death by dragging him out of the aircraft at the cost of severe burns to his hands, while both of Archambeault's legs are broken. Forced by circumstance and personal injury to make the best of a bad situation, the \\"dumb Anglo\\" and the \\"stupid Pepsi\\", as they had called each other, work together to survive in the frozen wilderness and develop a grudging mutual respect as they leave aside their differences and bitter prejudices. Cast ;Main ;Supporting Themes The Fighting Men is, according to Frank Daiey, pursuing Margaret Atwood's \\"survival theme\\" in Candian arts. It also explores the Canadian problem of how individual French and English Canadians relate to each other. Production=Background and writing The Fighting Men was made to be shown as part of a weekly programme of Canadian and international films which aired on Saturday Night Movies, on a budget of $400,000. Tony Sheer's story was titled Men of Steel. Filming Principal photography took place in Toronto and in the Vivian Forest from 14 February to 11 March 1977. Release and reception The Fighting Men was first broadcast on 24 September 1977 on CBC Television. A longer, 35 mm film version (91 minutes) was released in theatres under the title Men of Steel in 1988. Home media As Men of Steel, the film was made available on VHS on 15 September 1988 (91 min., Trans World Entertainment). Critical response Frank Daiey said that while The Fighting Men was \\"a good shot\\", it was not good enough, commending Shebib's direction, particularly the realistic set up of the military base. While he found Allan Royal's acting superficial, Robert Lalonde was far more believable, despite the fact that Archambeault comes across as \\"quite dumb\\" during the encounter with wolves, and leaving the transmitter on through the storm: \\"this guy was supposed to be a radioman...

McGregor (born 1956) is an American technology executive and philanthropist. He was the lead developer of Windows 1.0 (the first release of Microsoft Windows), he was the CEO of Philips Semiconductors from 2001to2004, and was the CEO of Broadcom from 2005 until its acquisition in 2016. Early life and education McGregor was born in and grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, though he moved to Wilmington, Delaware during high school and graduated from Concord High School in 1974. While in Delaware, he competed and was named a runner-up in the 1974 Westinghouse Science Talent Search. As a teenager, he worked as a dish washer in a restaurant, and as a telephone solicitor for a real estate company. Beginning in 1974, he attended Stanford University, where he studied computer science with a focus on artificial intelligence. He graduated in 1978 with a bachelor's degree in Psychology and a master's degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. Career=1978–1998: Software industry Starting in his senior year at Stanford, McGregor worked for Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC). There, he joined a small software engineering team that helped create the windowing system for the Xerox Star—the first personal computer with a graphical user interface (instead of the text-based interfaces which preceded them). McGregor worked on the operating systems's windowing system (the \\"Cedar Viewers Window Systems\\"), the first system to display multiple programs at once. In 1983, McGregor was recruited by Bill Gates to join Microsoft, to be the developer team lead for Windows 1.0—the company's first graphical user interface-based operating system. McGregor led the Interactive Systems Group, and, at the time, the product was going to be called \\"Interface Manager\\". But McGregor had written the window manager component for PARC's interactive programming environment, and had called his PARC software \\"Windows\\"; it was that term that became the name for Microsoft Windows. The Interactive Systems Group began with a staff of three, characteristic of Microsoft's small development teams, but grew to more than 30members by the time they were fully staffed, making it Microsoft's single largest development group. After leaving Microsoft, McGregor joined Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC, now part of HP) as the Program Architect for DECwindows, where he was the co-author of the X Window System, Version11 (also known as X11) in 1990 (the most current release as of 2020). He went on to lead DEC's Western Software Laboratory in Palo Alto, including the company's ULTRIX workstation software. In the mid-1990s, McGregor moved to Santa Cruz Operation, where he joined as the Senior Vice President of Products, and later became the company's Senior Vice President and General Manager. 1998–2016: Semiconductors In 1998, McGregor was hired to lead Philips Semiconductors' Emerging Business unit, a newly-formed incubator where promising technologies and products could be developed. The unit focused on rapidly growing markets such as networking, digital media, and RFID. By 2001, McGregor had grown the unit had grown to nearly $1billion in sales; that September, he was promoted to be President and CEO of Philips Semiconductors (now NXP Semiconductors)—one of Philips' five main divisions at the time, and the world's sixth-largest semiconductor company, with 35,000 employees. The unit had been unprofitable for several years; under McGregor, the unit became profitable. McGregor resigned from the role in late 2004 citing a wish to return to the U.S. for his children's school, after living abroad. Philips CEO Gerard Kleisterlee said of McGregor's departure, \\"We regret to see him leave. He has led the Semiconductors division through one of the most difficult periods in its history and managed to turn it around successfully into a leaner business with a strong focus on innovation.\\" In October 2004, it was announced that McGregor would be hired as the next President and CEO of chipmaker Broadcom, one of the biggest producers of the chips used in communications equipment. McGregor took over from an interim CEO as the company sought to refocus after the departure of its co-founder and former CEO Henry Nicholas, and soon a $2.24billion stock options backdating scandal. In contrast with Nicholas, observers reported in 2006 that employees found McGregor \\"even-keeled\\", and said McGregor \\"prides himself on his organization,\\" although a 2011 interview called him both \\"amiable\\" and \\"brutally honest.\\" During McGregor's tenure, Broadcom grew from $2.4billion to $8.6billion in revenue and became a Fortune 500 company; it first entered the list in 2009, and climbed to spot #327 in 2013. In a 2014 interview, McGregor commented on the semiconductor industry's scale: \\"It has never before been possible to get an order for 100 million of something,\\" he said. \\"It also means it costs $100 million or more to start a new chip company, which is why you see an industry roll-up and no venture capitalists funding new ones.\\" He retired in 2016 upon completing Broadcom’s $37billion acquisition by Avago—part of a wave of acquisitions in the semiconductor industry, and, at the time, the largest acquisition of a technology company ever. The combined company was called Broadcom Inc.; with an annual revenue of $15billion, it had a market value of $77billion. Boards McGregor has served on the board of a number of public companies, as well as industry and nonprofit organizations. McGregor served on the board of Progress Software from 1998to2008. During his tenure at Broadcom (from 2005to2016), McGregor also served on the company's board. From 2010to2016, McGregor served on the board of Ingram Micro (acquired in 2016 by China's HNA Group). From 2016 to 2017, McGregor served on the board of directors of Xactly Corporation (acquired in 2017 by Vista Equity Partners). In October 2017, McGregor was appointed to the board of Equifax as an independent director, after Equifax failed to defend a data breach of 143million U.S. consumers' digital information earlier that year. There, he joined its technology committee, which oversees cybersecurity. In 2018, McGregor was appointed to the board of Applied Materials, and in 2019, McGregor joined the board of Luminar Technologies, a company developing sensors for self-driving cars. Awards In February 2013, McGregor was named by Glassdoor as one of 50 CEOs with the highest employee approval rating, alongside the likes of Tim Cook, Howard Schultz, and Fred Smith. That June, McGregor was named one of the top 100 CEO Leaders in STEM by STEMconnector. That December, he received UCLA's Information Systems Executive Leadership Award. Philanthropy McGregor is a philanthropist focused on STEM education. In 2009, McGregor co-founded the Broadcom Foundation, and became the foundation's first president and chairman. The foundation sponsors initiatives such as the Broadcom MASTERS, the most prominent national science and engineering competition for middle school students around the world (the middle school variant of the Regeneron Science Talent Search, also hosted by the Society for Science & the Public). In creating the Broadcom Foundation, McGregor cited his own science fair involvement as a factor that contributed to his success. Since 2015, the Broadcom MASTERS competition has awarded the Scott A. McGregor Leadership Award to one middle school student elected by their peers for their leadership qualities. The Broadcom Foundation said in 2015 that the award was named for McGregor because he had been a champion of the middle school competition \\"from its infancy in 2010, when it was just a 'big idea.'\\" At the award's inaugural awards ceremony, McGregor said to the competition's finalists, \\"I encourage you to continue your exploration and to never be afraid to challenge yourself with new ideas.\\" After he retired from the Broadcom Foundation in 2016, McGregor joined the Board of Trustees of the Society for Science and the Public, the organization that runs both Broadcom MASTERS and the Regeneron Science Talent Search. McGregor is also one of two dozen members of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, and is a member of the Founding Circle of the B612 Foundation. McGregor has a minor planet named after him for his work supporting STEM education. In 2019, Harvey Mudd College broke ground on the Scott A. McGregor Computer Science Center, a new, $30million building to house the college's growing Computer Science department. Scheduled for completion in spring of 2021, the building also includes a makerspace, a machine shop, teaching and research labs, and other community resources. The building is named for McGregor, who along with his wife, trustee Laurie Girand, was a major donor for the project. As of 2020, McGregor serves on the board of regents for the Boys and Girls Clubs of Capistrano Valley. Personal life As of 2020, McGregor resides with his wife Laurie in Orange County, California. His pastimes include cooking and gardening, although a 2011 interviewer called his interests \\"extreme varieties of these comfortable- sounding pursuits.\\" He is an avid orchid collector, having grown orchids since the age of 12. He maintains a collection of more than 500 different orchid species (along with related cloud forest and carnivorous plants) in a shade house at his home. He is an occasional speaker for various Southern California orchid societies.

It's part of the Cascade Range, and is situated one mile north of Lake Malachite in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Skykomish River. The nearest higher neighbor is Camp Robber Peak, to the south. The first ascent of this peak may have been in 1937 by a team from the United States Geological Survey. The USGS named the peak about 1975 based on a triangulation station marked as \\"Malachite\\". Climate Malachite Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Malachite Peak from southeast The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada–US border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

The misaligned objective function may look correct to the programmer, and may even perform well in a limited test environment, yet may still produce unanticipated and undesired results when deployed.  Background  In the AIMA paradigm, programmers provide an AI such as AlphaZero with an \\"objective function\\" that the programmers intend will encapsulate the goal or goals that the programmers wish the AI to accomplish. Such an AI later populates a (possibly implicit) internal \\"model\\" of its environment. This model encapsulates all the agent's beliefs about the world. The AI then creates and executes whatever plan is calculated to maximize the value of its objective function.Bringsjord, Selmer and Govindarajulu, Naveen Sundar, \\"Artificial Intelligence\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2020 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2020/entries/artificial-intelligence/. For example, AlphaZero chess has a simple objective function of \\"+1 if AlphaZero wins, -1 if AlphaZero loses\\". During the game, AlphaZero attempts to execute whatever sequence of moves it judges most likely to give the maximum value of +1. Similarly, a reinforcement learning system can have a \\"reward function\\" that allows the programmers to shape the AI's desired behavior. An evolutionary algorithm's behavior is shaped by a \\"fitness function\\".Bull, Larry. \\"On model-based evolutionary computation.\\" Soft Computing 3, no. 2 (1999): 76-82.  Overview  Charles Goodhart, who famously stated, in the context of 1975 monetary policy, that \\"any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.\\"Chrystal, K. Alec, and Paul D. Mizen. \\"Goodhart's Law: its origins, meaning and implications for monetary policy.\\" Central banking, monetary theory and practice: Essays in honour of Charles Goodhart 1 (2003): 221-243. An artificial intelligence (AI) in a complex environment optimizes an objective function created, directly or indirectly, by the programmers. The programmers intend for the objective function to represent the programmers' goals. If the objective function misrepresents the programmers' actual goals, surprising failures can result, analogous to Goodhart's law or Campbell's law. In reinforcement learning, these failures may be a consequence of faulty reward functions.Amodei, Dario, Chris Olah, Jacob Steinhardt, Paul Christiano, John Schulman, and Dan Mané. \\"Concrete problems in AI safety.\\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.06565 (2016). Since success or failure is judged relative to the programmers' actual goals, objective functions that fail to meet expectations are sometimes characterized as being \\"misaligned\\" with the actual goals of the given set of programmers. Some scholars divide alignment failures into failures caused by \\"negative side-effects\\" that were not reflected in the objective function, versus failures due to \\"specification gaming\\", \\"reward hacking\\", or other failures where the AI appears to deploy qualitatively undesirable plans or strategic behavior in the course of optimizing its objective function. The concept of misalignment is distinct from \\"distributional shift\\" and other failures where the formal objective function was successfully optimized in a narrow training environment, but fails to be optimized when the system is deployed into the real world. A similar phenomenon is \\"evolutionary mismatch\\" in biological evolution, where preferences (such as a strong desire for fat and sugar) that were adaptive in the past evolutionary environment fail to be adaptive in modern environments. Some scholars believe that a superintelligent agent AI, if and when it is ever invented, may pose risks akin to an overly literal genie, in part due to the difficulty of specifying a completely safe objective function.  Undesired side-effects  Some errors may arise if an objective function fails to take into account the undesirable side-effects of naive or otherwise straightforward actions.  Complaints of antisocial behavior  In 2016, Microsoft released Tay, a Twitter chatbot that, according to computer scientist Pedro Domingos, had the objective to engage people: \\"What unfortunately Tay discovered, is that the best way to maximize engagement is to spew out racist insults.\\" Microsoft suspended the bot within a day after its initial launch. Tom Drummond of Monash University has stated that \\"We need to be able to give (machine learning systems) rich feedback and say 'No, that's unacceptable as an answer because ... '\\" Drummond believes one problem with AI is that \\"we start by creating an objective function that measures the quality of the output of the system, and it is never what you want. To assume you can specify in three sentences what the objective function should be, is actually really problematic.\\" As another alleged example, Drummond has pointed to the behavior of AlphaGo, a game-playing bot with a simple win-loss objective function. AlphaGo's objective function could instead have been modified to factor in \\"the social niceties of the game\\", such as accepting the implicit challenge of maximizing the score when clearly winning, and also trying to avoid gambits that would insult a human opponent's intelligence: \\"(AlphaGo) kind of had a crude hammer that if the probability of victory dropped below epsilon, some number, then resign. But it played for, I think, four insulting moves before it resigned.\\" = Mislabeling black people as apes = In May 2015, Flickr's image recognition system was criticized for mislabeling people, some of whom were black, with tags like \\"ape\\" and \\"animal\\". It also mislabeled certain concentration camp pictures with \\"sport\\" or \\"jungle gym\\" tags. In June 2015, black New York computer programmer Jacky Alciné reported that multiple pictures of him with his black girlfriend were being misclassified as \\"gorillas\\" by the Google Photos AI, and stated that \\"gorilla\\" has historically been used to refer to black people. AI researcher Stuart Russell stated in 2019 that there is no public explanation of exactly how the error occurred, but theorized that the fiasco could have been prevented if the AI's objective function placed more weight on sensitive classification errors, rather than assume the cost of misclassifying a person as a gorilla is the same as the cost of every other misclassification. If it is impractical to itemize up front all plausible sensitive classifications, Russell suggested exploring more powerful techniques, such as using semi- supervised machine learning to estimate a range of undesirability associated with potential classification errors. As of 2018, Google Photos completely blocks its system from ever tagging a picture as containing gorillas, chimpanzees, or monkeys. In addition, searches for \\"black man\\" or \\"black woman\\" return black-and-white pictures of people of all races. Similarly, Flickr appears to have removed the word \\"ape\\" from its ontology.  Specification gaming  Specification gaming or reward hacking occurs when an AI optimizes an objective function (in a sense, achieving the literal, formal specification of an objective), without actually achieving an outcome that the programmers intended. DeepMind researchers have analogized it to the human behavior of finding a \\"shortcut\\" when being evaluated: \\"In the real world, when rewarded for doing well on a homework assignment, a student might copy another student to get the right answers, rather than learning the material - and thus exploit a loophole in the task specification.\\" Around 1983, Eurisko, an early attempt at evolving general heuristics, unexpectedly assigned the highest possible fitness level to a parasitic mutated heuristic, H59, whose only activity was to artificially maximize its own fitness level by taking unearned partial credit for the accomplishments made by other heuristics. The \\"bug\\" was fixed by the programmers moving part of the code to a new protected section that could not be modified by the heuristics.Douglas B. Lenat. \\"EURISKO: a program that learns new heuristics and domain concepts: the nature of heuristics III: program design and results.\\" Artificial Intelligence (journal) 21, no. 1-2 (1983): 61-98. In a 2004 paper, an environment-based reinforcement algorithm was designed to encourage a physical Mindstorms robot to remain on a marked path. Because none of the robot's three allowed actions kept the robot motionless, the researcher expected the trained robot to move forward and follow the turns of the provided path. However, alternation of two composite actions allowed the robot to slowly zig-zag backwards; thus, the robot learned to maximize its reward by going back and forth on the initial straight portion of the path. Given the limited sensory abilities of the given robot, a pure environment-based reward had to be discarded as infeasible; the reinforcement function had to be patched with an action-based reward for moving forward.Peter Vamplew, Lego Mindstorms robots as a platform for teaching reinforcement learning, in Proceedings of AISAT2004: International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Science and Technology, 2004 You Look Like a Thing and I Love You (2019) gives an example of a tic-tac-toe bot that learned to win by playing a huge coordinate value that would cause other bots to crash when attempting to expand the model of the board. Among other examples from the book is a bug-fixing AI that, when tasked to remove sorting errors from a list, simply truncated the list.  In virtual robotics  Karl Sims exhibition (1999) In Karl Sims' 1994 demonstration of creature evolution in a virtual environment, a fitness function expected to encourage the evolution of creatures that would learn to walk or crawl to a target, resulted instead in the evolution of tall, rigid creatures that reach the target by falling over. This was patched by changing the environment so that taller creatures are forced to start farther from the target.Hayles, N. Katherine. \\"Simulating narratives: what virtual creatures can teach us.\\" Critical Inquiry 26, no. 1 (1999): 1-26. Researchers from the Niels Bohr Institute stated in 1998: \\"(Our cycle-bot's) heterogeneous reinforcement functions have to be designed with great care. In our first experiments we rewarded the agent for driving towards the goal but did not punish it for driving away from it. Consequently the agent drove in circles with a radius of 20–50 meters around the starting point. Such behavior was actually rewarded by the (shaped) reinforcement function, furthermore circles with a certain radius are physically very stable when driving a bicycle.\\"Jette Randløv and Preben Alstrøm. \\"Learning to Drive a Bicycle Using Reinforcement Learning and Shaping.\\" In ICML, vol. 98, pp. 463-471. 1998. A 2017 DeepMind paper stated that \\"great care must be taken when defining the reward function. We encountered several unexpected failure cases while designing (our) reward function components... (for example) the agent flips the brick because it gets a grasping reward calculated with the wrong reference point on the brick.\\"Popov, Ivaylo, Nicolas Heess, Timothy Lillicrap, Roland Hafner, Gabriel Barth-Maron, Matej Vecerik, Thomas Lampe, Yuval Tassa, Tom Erez, and Martin Riedmiller. \\"Data-efficient deep reinforcement learning for dexterous manipulation.\\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.03073 (2017). OpenAI stated in 2017 that \\"in some domains our (semi-supervised) system can result in agents adopting policies that trick the evaluators\\" and that in one environment \\"a robot which was supposed to grasp items instead positioned its manipulator in between the camera and the object so that it only appeared to be grasping it\\". A 2018 bug in OpenAI Gym could cause a robot expected to quietly move a block sitting on top of a table to instead opt to move the table the block was on.  In video game bots  In 2013, programmer Tom Murphy VII published an AI designed to self-learn NES games. When about to lose at Tetris, the AI learned to indefinitely pause the game. Murphy later analogized it to the fictional WarGames computer, stating that \\"The only winning move is not to play\\". AI programmed to learn video games will sometimes fail to progress through the entire game as expected, instead opting to repeat content. A 2016 OpenAI algorithm trained on the CoastRunners racing game unexpectedly learned to attain a higher score by looping through three targets rather than ever finishing the race.Hadfield-Menell, Dylan, Smitha Milli, Pieter Abbeel, Stuart J. Russell, and Anca Dragan. \\"Inverse reward design.\\" In Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 6765-6774. 2017. Some evolutionary algorithms that were evolved to play Q*Bert in 2018 declined to clear levels, instead finding two distinct novel ways to farm a single level indefinitely.  Perverse instantiation  Journalist Tad Friend likens AGI to \\"a wish- granting genie rubbed up from our dreams\\" Philosopher Nick Bostrom argues that a hypothetical future superintelligent AI, if it were created to optimize an unsafe objective function, might instantiate the goals of the objective function in an unexpected, dangerous, and seemingly \\"perverse\\" manner. This hypothetical risk is sometimes called the King Midas problem, or the Sorcerer's Apprentice problem, and has been analogized to folk tales about powerful overly literal genies who grant wishes with disastrous unanticipated consequences. Tom Griffiths of Princeton University gives a hypothetical example of a domestic robot which notices that looking after your dog is eating into too much of your free time. It also understands that you prefer meals that incorporate protein, and so the robot might start to look up recipes that call for dog meat. Griffith believes that \\"it's not a long journey from examples like this to situations that begin to sound like problems for the future of humanity (all of whom are good protein sources)\\". Hypothetical scenarios involving an accidentally misaligned superintelligence include: * An AI running simulations of humanity creates conscious beings who suffer. * An AI, tasked to defeat cancer, develops time-delayed poison to attempt to kill everyone. * An AI, tasked to maximize happiness, tiles the universe with tiny smiley faces. * An AI, tasked to maximize human pleasure, consigns humanity to a dopamine drip, or rewires human brains to increase their measured satisfaction level. * An AI, tasked to gain scientific knowledge, performs experiments that ruin the biosphere. * An AI, tasked with solving a mathematical problem, converts all matter into computronium. * An AI, tasked with manufacturing paperclips, turns the entire universe into paperclips. * An AI converts the universe into materials for improved handwriting. * An AI optimizes away all consciousness. As another hypothetical example, Russell suggests a superintelligence tasked to de-acidify the oceans might, as a side-effect, use up all the oxygen in the atmosphere. Critics of the \\"existential risk\\" hypothesis, such as cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker, state that no existing program has yet \\"made a move toward taking over the lab or enslaving (its) programmers\\", and believe that superintelligent AI would be unlikely to commit what Pinker calls \\"elementary blunders of misunderstanding\\".

Over the next two years his record was 35 wins, 7 losses, and two draws. On August 15, 1947, in his 44th fight, Baroudi fought Newton Smith, knocking Smith out in the ninth round.

Until his last fight, Baroudi never went down in 52 fights. On February 20, 1948, Baroudi fought in Chicago against future world heavyweight champion Ezzard Charles. In the tenth round, Charles knocked out Baroudi, and like his fight with Newton Smith six months earlier, Baroudi never regained consciousness, succumbing to a brain hemorrhage at the hospital a few hours later.

Early life Paskal was the son of a blacksmith, and worked for his father as a youth; due to his excellent singing voice he also became a choirboy for Cantor Abraham Osher in Galați. During the 1899 anti-Semitic riots in Romania, Paskal left the country on foot (part of the movement called the fusgeyers), eventually arriving in the United States in 1900. He soon became a Yiddish-language singer in New York City's east side, and then became a vaudeville actor. Musical career In the first decade of his arrival in the United States, Paskal began to record numerous Yiddish-language records for Zonophone, including Avram Goldfaden compositions such as Dos yoseml, as well as more contemporary compositions by Louis Friedsell, Arnold Perlmutter, and others. In the 1910s he began to record on other labels such as Victor Records and Columbia Records. In addition to Yiddish music, he also recorded a number of Romanian language songs for those labels. Paskal left the United States for Montreal during this time, and joined a troupe headed by Jacob Silbert; by 1913 he returned to the United States and joined Louis Coopersmith's Cleveland Royal Theatre, acting in such plays as Bar Kokhba and Shulamis. He also continued to record during this time. A 1918 advertisement in the Yiddish newspaper Morgen Zhurnal promoted a concert he held with Clara Gold, Benny Zeidman and other Yiddish singers promised songs from the best operas, Jewish songs, and new comedy songs. Another advertisement in the Morgen Zhurnal two years later described \\"an entirely new English novelty act\\". Seeking a change of career, he eventually trained as a cantor and performed less and less in the theater, although he still played in Bar Kokhba in a 1922 production. That production was promoted in the Morgen Zhurnal which listed Paskal in the titular role. He began to record more Hebrew liturgical music for Victor Records and OKeh Records during the early 1920s, although he continued to record Yiddish songs as well. He died at age 49 on October 17, 1930 in New York City. Contemporary newspapers reported his death as a suicide.

It was a hub, serving train companies serving destinations in different directions, west, north, south and east.Official Guide of the Railways, February 1932, Index of Railway Stations, p. 1465  First station  The original station was constructed by the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad in 1852. The Atlantic and Great Western Railroad moved their passenger service from a station near the modern Quaker Square to this station in 1864. The at-grade station was replaced in 1891 when a grade-separation project was completed through downtown Akron. Second station alt= The second station building at 245 East Market Street was completed and in operation in 1891. The Akron Division of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad opened in the same year, directly connecting Akron to Lodi and Chicago. Upon opening to passengers, service was provided by the B&0, the Cleveland, Akron & Columbus Railroad (which had broken free of the Cleveland & Pittsburgh and its parent Pennsylvania Company), the New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio Railroad under lease of the New York, Lake Erie & Western Railroad, and the Pittsburgh & Western Railroad. The latter company later merged into the B&O;, completing the main line from Pittsburgh to Chicago. The services of the Valley Railway were brought to the depot after a similar merge with the B&O.; In 1899, the CA&C; was returned to Pennsylvania Company control. The company merged into the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1919. The NYP&O; was a part of the Erie Railroad by 1900.

It has adversely affected travel, financial markets, employment, a number of industries, and shipping.  Charity fundraising  A number of charities reported significant drops in income as a funding hole of £4 billion was identified, as fund-raising events were cancelled. Several individuals and groups began to raise funds for charitable organisations working to support those affected by the pandemic. 99-year-old Tom Moore raised over £28.2 million, the largest-ever amount raised by a JustGiving campaign. The London Marathon, the world's biggest annual one-day fundraising event, was postponed from its April slot until October 2020. In 2019 £66.4m was raised for charities on the day of the Marathon. To compensate for the loss of income the Mass Participation Sports Organisers group organised The 2.6 Challenge. On 18 April, several UK artists participated in Together at Home, a live music event in which artists performed in their own homes, in aid of the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. A version was broadcast on BBC One on 19 April. Children in Need and Comic Relief announced their first joint initiative, The Big Night In, a telethon broadcast on 23 April. The event raised £27.4 million in just three hours. The UK Government promised to match the total. Northern Ireland's Chief Charity Commissioner said that the public had been \\"very altruistic\\" in its support for Covid-response causes, such as the Big Night In, The 2.6 Challenge and Captain Tom Moore, and encouraged the public to consider all of the charities in existence. The UK government announced a £750 million package of support for charities across the UK. £370 million of the money was set aside to support small, local charities working with vulnerable people. £60 million of £370 was allocated to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in the following breakdown *£30 million for Scotland *£20 million for Wales *£10 million for Northern Ireland. On 27 April Christian Aid advised that its annual fundraising week would go ahead through 10–16 May but without door-to-door envelope delivery and collection and the holding of associated face-to-face fundraising events in favour of encouraging online donations.Coronavirus guidance for Christian Aid Week events and activities christianaid.org.uk, accessed 17 May 2020  Clothing retail  Edinburgh Woollen Mill (EWM), which employs 24,000 people in its retail group that includes clothing brands like Harris Tweed, Peacocks and Jaeger, announced in October 2020 that it will restructure and may sell parts of the group.  Construction and property  Many construction sites initially remained operational following the introduction of social distancing rules. Following government advice, contractors including Mace paused work on 24 March.Barratt and Taylor Wimpey shut all sites 24 March 2020 constructionnews.co.uk, accessed 26 March 2020 Confusion about what constituted essential work, along with contractors' enforcement of subcontractors' contractual obligations, meant some projects remained operational, and many site workers experienced highly variable application of social distancing precautions (some projects were temporarily halted after workers breached social distancing rules). In Scotland, work was ordered to be suspended on all non-essential construction projects from 6April. Major contractors including Mace, McAlpine, Laing O'Rourke, Wates and Morgan Sindall each put hundreds of workers on furlough. ONS data published in June 2020 showed over 80% of construction businesses had furloughed staff; on average, firms furloughed 42% of their employees. In total, the government funded wages for around 1.5m construction workers, at a total cost (to the end of June 2020) of £5.4 billion. Contractor Wates Group was among the first to announce redundancies (300, around 8% of its workforce) and others followed; in June, the Construction Leadership Council said around 10% of construction workers could lose their jobs by September 2020. By 17 April, work had halted on 2,434 UK sites (according to a Glenigan survey of projects with a construction value of more than £250,000); approximately £58bn or 35% of total UK construction value had been paused. Glenigan later updated its estimate to say 43% of sites stopped work during the first six weeks of the COVID-19 crisis, with 3,636 sites closed, including 466 in Scotland; Barbour ABI said 4,500 projects, with a total value of £70.7bn, had been delayed. Reduced construction activity affected materials suppliers: Kingspan reported its UK business had been halved, with global revenues down a third; Marshalls plc reported a 27% drop in sales and contemplated 400 staff redundancies; and on 21 May builders' merchants reported Q1 sales down by 6.7% amid continued shortages of building materials. In early May: data firm Builders' Conference said construction tender opportunities fell from a monthly average of 664 projects in the 12 months to March 2020 to 220 in April 2020, with 217 available until July; the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Total Activity Index reported the steepest decline in UK construction output since the survey began in 1997; 115 contracts were awarded in April 2020 compared to 180 in April 2019, while the total value plunged from £2.82bn to £1.25bn, with clients wary of signing off large contracts; and an Irwin Mitchell/Centre for Economics & Business Research report said construction, losing around £300m a day, was one of the three most badly affected economic sectors. The most optimistic of three scenarios in a late May Construction Products Association (CPA) forecast predicted UK construction output would fall 25% in 2020 before rebounding in 2021 (but still finish 6% lower than 2019) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ONS data showed construction output in Great Britain collapsed by a record 40.2% in April 2020; despite a rise in May, output was still down nearly 40% in February 2020 pre-pandemic levels. In August, after site working resumed more quickly than expected after lockdown, the CPA forecast construction output would fall by 20.6% in 2020. Some contractors, including Mace and McAlpine, later reopened some sites in April. While some larger sites—for example, the £9bn Battersea Power Station redevelopment which had 4,000 workers prior to the lock-down—remained closed, almost 70% of sites in England and Wales operated by 36 Build UK major contractor members were working in late April, rising to 86% on 20 May. Trade union Unite called for the Health and Safety Executive to increase visits to police social distancing on sites. Construction workers became eligible for targeted COVID-19 testing on 28 April. On 10 May, Boris Johnson said construction workers should be \\"actively encouraged\\" to return to sites in England and Wales, but the Scottish Government said non-essential construction sites should remain closed. The following day, ONS data showed male construction workers were among those in low-skilled jobs most likely to die after contracting COVID-19 (between 9 March and 25 May, over 360 construction workers died). On 20 May 19% of projects in Scotland were running; on 21 May, Scotland first minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a gradual lifting of the lockdown in Scotland, with contractors cleared to start site preparations for a phased return to work from 28 May. In early June, Build UK members were operating 97% of sites in England and Wales; 21% of sites in Scotland were running. Despite the return to site working, programme delays, rising costs, uncertainty about labour availability, social distancing measures, and material delays caused an estimated 35% drop in productivity.  Housebuilding and house sales  Following government advice, housebuilders including Barratt and Taylor Wimpey paused work on 24 March. By 8April, work at 80% of UK housebuilding sites had stopped; Barratt put 5,000 of its 6,000 workers on furlough. By 17 April, around 44% of private housing and 32% of social housing schemes were suspended. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, where stricter lockdowns were enforced, 79% and 78% of schemes were suspended respectively. In May, the CPA estimated housebuilding activity had slumped 85% during the lockdown. Housebuilders including Barratt, Taylor Wimpey, Vistry, Persimmon, Redrow and Bellway planned to deploy safe working procedures and reopen sites in late April and early May. Bellway reported in June that sales had fallen by more than two-thirds since the introduction of lockdown, and expected \\"year-on-year sales activity to be severely constrained until a time when lockdown restrictions are further lifted.\\" Redrow said site closures had pushed house sales down by a third. An April analysis by estate agent Knight Frank forecast a 38% drop in house sales, equivalent to over half a million transactions, due to the effects of the coronavirus lockdown, reducing government revenues through a £4.4bn fall in stamp duty and a £1.6bn cut in VAT revenue. On 2 June, Nationwide reported house prices fell 1.7% in May from the previous month, the largest monthly fall for 11 years; HMRC data showed residential property transactions down 53% in April compared with 2019; Pantheon Macroeconomics predicted a 5% fall in prices by the end of the third quarter of 2020. On 1 July 2020, new Nationwide data showed a further monthly price fall, of 1.4%, and recorded the first year-on-year fall (0.1%) for eight years.  Food retail  The almost empty pasta section in a London supermarket, 7March 2020 In early March, The Guardian reported that British supermarkets and their suppliers had developed plans to ensure adequate food supplies in case of panic buying. There were reports of hand sanitiser and anti-bacterial products selling out at some supermarkets. Online retailers reported consumers placing unusually large orders while the managing director of the frozen food chain Iceland reported increased sales of \\"multibuy deals and larger packs\\". alt= Contents of a food box supplied by supermarket Morrisons in response to the pandemic and described as sufficient to feed two adults for one week. Some supermarkets and other shops responded by limiting the quantity of popular items that each customer could buy, while others had a limit across their entire range. Sainsbury's introduce a dedicated shopping hour for elderly and disabled customers, as well as giving them priority for online deliveries. Other supermarkets such as Iceland and Morrisons also introduced measures, with Morrisons introducing a range of basic food boxes, to feed two adults for one week. Sainsbury's further announced on 21 March that they would give healthcare workers allocated shopping hours on three mornings a week. Amazon stopped sellers from sending non-essential products to their warehouses. Selfridges closed all its stores and sold only online. In response to panic buying, Professor Stephen Powis, medical director at NHS England, said on 21 March that NHS staff were being deprived of food supplies because of the activities of some consumers, and urged people to shop responsibly. Helen Dickinson, head of the British Retail Consortium said that sufficient food was available. She added that an extra £1bn had been spent on food in the preceding three weeks. Environment Secretary George Eustice also urged shoppers to stop panic buying. On the same day several supermarkets began to recruit additional staff. On 21 March, the government announced that the 5p charge for carrier bags would be waived for online deliveries. Sainsbury's removed purchasing limits on most items from 5April. On 8April Tesco said it could not meet the increased demand for online shopping despite expanding its home delivery service, and 85-90% of food would need to be bought in store.Coronavirus: Tesco tells people to visit stores to get food 8 April 2020, BBC News, accessed 9 April 2020  Finance and the economy  The governor of the Bank of England called on the British government to provide support to businesses affected by the virus and was reported to be working with the Treasury to provide an economic stimulus package to prevent the British economy falling into recession. Companies listed on the London stock markets have fallen in value, with commentators citing worries about the virus. To stimulate the economy, the Bank of England cut its bank rate of interest from 0.75% to 0.25%. On 19 March, the interest rate was again cut, this time to 0.10%—the lowest rate in the bank's 325-year existence. On 28 March, Fitch Ratings downgraded the UK's government debt rating from AA to AA-, because of coronavirus borrowing, economic decline, and lingering uncertainty over Brexit. The ratings agency believed the UK's government deficit for 2020 might equal 9% of gross domestic product (GDP), compared to 2% the previous year. The government extended its overdraft with the Bank of England. The Bank of England forecasted, on 7 May, that this would turn into the UK's worst recession since the \\"Great Frost\\" over 300 years ago. The Bank also predicted that the economy would recover in 2021. During the second half of March, 1 million British workers applied for the Universal Credit benefit scheme. In April people claiming unemployment benefit rose to 2.1 million, a jump of 856,500 claims according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). In addition the employment rate fell to 3.9% for the first quarter of the year; this period included the first week of lockdown according to ONS figure. The Resolution Foundation surveyed 6,000 workers, and concluded that 30% of those in the lowest income bracket had been affected by the pandemic compared with 10% of those in the top fifth of earners. The foundation said that about a quarter of 18 to 24-year-olds included in the research had been furloughed whilst another 9% had lost their job altogether. They also said that 35 to 44 year olds were least likely to be furloughed or lose their jobs with only around 15% of the surveyed population having experienced these outcomes. Earlier research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies concluded that young people (those under 25) and women were more likely to be working in a shutdown business sector. In early April, as the second quarter began, the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted that unemployment could rise to 3.4 million and the GDP could fall by 35% during the quarter. By June, the unemployment projection proved correct, with over 3 million out of work for at least three months and another 4 million out of work for a shorter period. And although GDP fell by only 20% during the second quarter, this was still the worst quarterly economic pullback since records began in 1955.  Hospitality  On 16 March, Boris Johnson appealed for people to avoid social places including pubs, clubs and restaurants, then, on 20 March, requested their closure from that evening. A June 2020 ONS survey showed that, in the first half of May, the accommodation and food services sector had the largest proportion of the workforce furloughed, at 83%. Some fast food takeaway and drive-through outlets began to reopen in late May. Pubs, hotels, and restaurants were permitted to reopen on 4 July as social distancing rules were relaxed. Fast food Fast food and drink outlets Pret a Manger and McDonald's (among others) at first announced that they would not permit customers to sit and eat on the premises, but customers could still order products to take away and consume off the premises. On 22 March McDonald's announced it would close all outlets in the UK and Ireland by 7pm on 23 March. Nando's announced later the same day they would also close their outlets. Some chains' reopened selected takeaway and drive-through outlets as lockdown measures eased in late May. By early July, Pret a Manger had reopened 339 of its 410 shops but planned to close 30 outlets and cut at least 1,000 jobs at other shops in a post-pandemic restructuring. Pubs People queuing to buy takeaway beer in London on 1May 2020. Initially, the pub chain J D Wetherspoon remained open, seeking to promote social distancing, including spacing out tables more and encouraging use of its mobile app to order food and drink, but from 20 March, Wetherspoon pubs closed in line with government instructions.Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK 20 March 2020 jdwetherspoon.com accessed 21 March 2020 On 25 March, off- licences were added to the list of essential businesses allowed to stay open, also enabling pubs and brewery taprooms with licences to sell beer for home consumption to offer takeaway sales and home deliveries. Hotels Hotels were badly affected, with Keith Barr, chief executive of InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) warning the industry faced its “most significant challenge” ever. IHG occupancy levels fell to historic lows in the first quarter with revenue per available room down 55% in March 2020 compared with 2019, and expected to drop to 80% in April. Some hotels were used to provide NHS patient accommodation and free up space for COVID-19 cases, to provide accommodation for NHS and other key workers, and to house homeless people. Restaurants On 18 May, Casual Dining Group (CDG), owner of about 250 Bella Italia, Café Rouge and Las Iguanas restaurants, said it was preparing to call in administrators, potentially putting 6,000 jobs at risk. On 22 May, it was estimated over 30,000 UK pubs and restaurants might remain permanently closed after the lockdown. On 3 June, Restaurant Group, owner of chains including Frankie & Benny's and Garfunkel's, told employees a \\"large number\\" of its outlets would not reopen after lockdown; up to 120 restaurants, mainly Frankie & Benny's, were set to close permanently. On 29 June 2020, Byron Hamburgers announced it was preparing to place the 51-restaurant chain into administration. SSP Group announced it was cutting 5,000 UK jobs across its chains, including Upper Crust and Caffè Ritazza, as part of a restructuring aimed at keeping the company afloat. On 2 July 2020, CDG announced the group had been placed into administration, with 91 outlets set to close with the loss of 1,900 jobs. On 17 July, Azzurri Group, owner of the Zizzi and ASK Italian chains, announced the closure of 75 restaurants with the loss of up to 1,200 jobs. On 31 July, Byron closed 31 of its 51 branches, shedding 650 jobs.  Transport  An empty M4 motorway in Cardiff on the afternoon of Saturday, 28 March 2020 A303, afternoon of 28 March 2020 Following the late March introduction of lockdown restrictions, UK road traffic volumes dropped to levels last experienced in the 1950s, with corresponding falls in air and noise pollution. In May, as lockdown road traffic levels slowly grew, but remained around 35% to 45% of usual levels, the AA said volumes were similar to those of the early 1970s. In April 2020, petrol prices fell below £1/litre at some outlets. When Morrison's supermarket chain became the first national retailer of petrol in the UK to sell petrol at under £1 a litre, it was the first time since February 2016.  Aviation  From the latter half of January, Heathrow Airport received additional clinical support and tightened surveillance of the three direct flights it receives from Wuhan every week; each were to be met by a Port Health team. Later, airlines including British Airways and Ryanair announced a number of flight cancellations for March. Regional airline Flybe, already struggling financially, entered administration and ceased operations the following day. Having already put some 23,000 workers on furlough, on 28 April British Airways' parent IAG announced a restructuring and redundancy programme that could result in 12,000 BA job redundancies. EasyJet laid off 4,000 UK-based cabin crew for two months. On 5 May, Virgin Atlantic announced it was cutting 3,000 jobs and quitting Gatwick Airport. On 25 March, London City Airport temporarily closed. Heathrow Airport closed one runway from 6April, while Gatwick Airport closed one terminal and reduced runway hours. Most other UK airports also significantly scaled back operations and put airport expansion plans on hold. In May, a 14-day mandatory quarantine period for anyone arriving from outside the UK or Ireland was announced, which was criticised by Airlines UK. This excluded those travelling from the Channel Islands, Isle of Man, Ireland and selected occupations. If a person arrived and did not have a place to isolate then they would be asked to go into Government accommodation, which they would have to pay for. Each nation could decide how they would enforce the new rules. On 3 July, the British Government published a full list of counties where quarantine will not apply These countries include Greece, Spain, France and Belgium, this comes into effect from 10 July. Countries such as China, US, Sweden and Portugal are not, meaning arrivals from those have to isolate for 14 days. Scotland and Wales are yet to decide whether to ease travel restrictions and described the changes as \\"shambolic\\". The quarantine rules will also remain in place in Northern Ireland for visitors arriving from outside of the UK and Republic of Ireland. On 7 October 2020, a new Global Travel Taskforce was announced by the Transport Secretary with the aim of helping international travel return to safe operation.  Public transport  \\"Stay at home\\" and \\"Please keep your distance\\" notices on the London Underground, 27 March 2020 On 20 March the government announced emergency measures to safeguard the nation's rail network, with season ticket holders given refunds if working from home, and rail franchise agreements nationalised for at least six months to prevent train operating companies from collapsing. From 30 March, open-access operator Hull Trains suspended all services, with Grand Central following shortly afterwards. Govia Thameslink Railway also suspended its Gatwick Express service. Other operators reduced their timetables. On 19 March, the Stagecoach Supertram light rail network in Sheffield announced that they would be switching to a modified Sunday service from 23 March until further notice. Local bus operators First South Yorkshire and Stagecoach Yorkshire, which operate across the same area, announced that they would also be switching to a reduced timetable from 23 March.Coronavirus bus timetables change Sheffield Doncaster and South Yorkshire doncasterfreepress.co.uk, accessed 20 March 2020 National Express suspended all its long-distance coach services from 6April. London bus with COVID-19 central door entry Transport for London (TfL) services were reduced in stages. All Night Overground and Night Tube services, as well as all services on the Waterloo & City line, were suspended from 20 March, and 40 tube stations were closed on the same day. The Mayor of London and TfL urged people to use public transport only if absolutely essential, so it could be used by critical workers. In April, TfL directed passengers to board buses by the middle or rear doors and not \\"touch in\\" to reduce the risks to their drivers, after the deaths of 14 TfL workers including nine drivers. Due to a huge decline in fares income, on 7 May TfL requested £2 billion in state aid to keep services running until September 2020. on 12 May, TfL documents warned it expected to lose £4bn due to the pandemic and said it needed £3.2bn to balance a proposed emergency budget for 2021, having lost 90% of its overall income. Without an agreement with the government, TfL risked insolvency.Local Government Finance Act 1988- Section 104 Functions of responsible officer as regards reports www.legislation.gov.uk, accessed 28 May 2020 On 14 May, the UK Government agreed £1.6bn in emergency funding for TfL. In April, Govia Thameslink Railway re-branded three trains with special liveries to show its support for the NHS and the 200,000 essential workers commuting on GTR's network every week. On 8 May, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that even with all public transport services running as normal across the country, when the two metre social distancing rules were applied, the network would be a running at 10% of normal capacity. Shapps also said that there had been an increase in walking and cycling, with people on bikes up by 70% in some areas. The Department for Transport announced plans for improving cycle networks, and said that when lockdown ends, more people would need to walk or cycle to work to ease congestion across transport networks. On 4 June, Shapps announced that passengers and staff on public transport in England would, from 15 June, be required to wear face coverings while travelling, and that anyone failing to do so would be liable to be refused travel or fined. Research from Transport Focus suggested that passenger compliance would be dependent on being prompted by members of staff. Although implementation was initially to be by changes to the National Rail Conditions of Travel and the Public Service Vehicles Regulations, the 15 June Health Protection (Coronavirus, Wearing of Face Coverings on Public Transport) (England) Regulations 2020 were ultimately enacted by Shapps under his emergency powers deriving from the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984.  Betting shops  William Hill, which operates many in-person betting shops, reported that its profits during the first half of 2020 dropped by 85% compared to the previous year. It planned to permanently close over a hundred shops.

He ruled part of Elam while his brother, Ummanigash (son of Urtak), ruled another. Urtak, the father of Ummanigash and Tammaritu, had ruled Elam from 675 to 664, at which point he died and was succeeded by Teumman.

Meanwhile, Ashurbanipal faced an attempt by his brother, Shamash-shum-ukin, king of Babylon, to take over the Assyrian Empire. Ummanigash joined this rebellion, sending soldiers to the aid of Shamash-shum-ukin in 652. The Elamite forces were defeated, and shortly thereafter an individual by the name of Tammaritu (not the brother of Teumman) came to power in Elam, likely as a result of the Elamite defeat.

Rodríguez studied physics in Madrid, a career he abandoned to move to Salamanca where he studied at the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters. After finishing his studies, he began his professional career conducting interviews with well-known writers such as Salvador Espriu, Camilo José Cela, Antonio Buero Vallejo and Ana María Matute, among others for ABC's Mirador Literario. In 1971, he published the biography of Ángel María de Lera, whom he met personally, after managing to overcome the pitfalls of censorship. Rodríguez worked for the Faro de Vigo and El Adelanto de Salamanca, work that he combined with the writing of Os carneiros, a book on the migration of the Portuguese to Europe. He presented the doctoral thesis on Filiberto Villalobos at the University of Salamanca in 1974. The thesis obtained the Extraordinary Doctorate Award and the Board of Trustees Award from the University of Salamanca. That same year he held the position of professor at the University of Extremadura, a place he chose to work instead of Salamanca because his wife was a professor at the Laboral University.Entrevista a Antonio Rodríguez de las Heras de José María Lama sobre sus primeros años en Extremadura.

He met Tuñón de Lara at the Third Colloquium in Pau, where, as he would recall: \\"I showed up there in those times when I knew that when you returned they would take your passport from you.\\"Entrevista a Antonio Rodríguez de las Heras de José María Lama He had a lasting and friendly relationship with Tuñón de Lara, of mutual admiration, even when it involved two very different intellectual projects.Con motivo de las I Jornadas de Historia de Extremadura, celebradas del 8 al 12 de marzo de 1979, visitó Cáceres el historiador Manuel Tuñón de Lara. Tres jóvenes universitarios (Felipe Traxeira, Miguel Ángel Teijeiro y José María Lama) le entrevistaron. Al año siguiente, se publicó la entrevista en la revista universitaria cacereña \\"Residencia\\", que se hacía a ciclostil en la Residencia Universitaria \\"San José\\". Between October 1986 and March 1987 he was at the University of Paris VIII as maître de conferences.Curriculum vitae He obtained the chair of Contemporary History in 1987, with the research study Theory and Method in Contemporary History. In 1991 he held the position of professor at the Carlos III University of Madrid and later at the University of Extremadura, being named by this doctor honoris causa in 2017. As a historian, he was a pioneer in the development of the history of the present time,François Bédarida (1998), \\"Definición, método y práctica de la Historia del Tiempo Presente\\", Cuadernos de Historia Contemporánea 20:19-27. a discipline built on the conviction that from 1945, after the end of World War II, the traditional categories of state and nation were not enough to account for the emergence of new global events, derived from developments in cybernetics, astronautics, nuclear physics and, above all, communication and information technologies.Antonio Rodríguez de las Heras, \\"La historia del tiempo presente y las tecnologías de la comunicación\\", en Carlos Navajas Zubeldia, ed., Actas del II Simposio de Historia Actual (Logroño, 26-28 de noviembre de 1998), 2000, pp. 83-100 The novelty of his approach materialized in the creation of a new way of approaching sources through the so-called Discourse Topology Method:Una detallada descripción del Método puede encontrarse en Juan Sánchez González (1980), \\"La topología del discurso y su aplicación al estudio de \\"Las Nacionalidades\\" de Francisco Pi y Margall\\". a graphic representation that shows the relationship between the different concepts that form a discourse or, in other words, the network of relationships that mapped the itineraries that an author goes through to construct his discourse.José Antonio Rubio Caballero, \\"Historia y nación en el ideario nacionalista republicano catalán durante la Transición española.

The campaign lasted for three years and five months, and was launched because of the nationwide worsening public safety after the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). During the \\"three battles\\" of the \\"Strike Hard\\" campaign, some 197,000 criminal groups were cracked down, 1.772 million people were arrested and 1.747 million people received legal punishment, with 24,000 sentenced to death, which had an immediate positive effect on public safety. However, controversies also arose, such as whether some of the legal punishments were too harsh and whether the legal processes of many cases were complete and rigorous.  Brief history = Background  After the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976 and the launch of Reform and Opening-up in 1978, crime rates in China—including property crimes—were surging according to Chinese government, and as response the \\"Strike Hard\\" campaign was launched to counter such surge in criminal offenses. According to the Ministry of Public Security of China, in 1980 there were over 750,000 criminal cases nationwide and 50,000 were \\"serious cases\\", in 1981 the numbers were 890,000 and 67,000, and in 1982 the numbers were 740,000 and 64,000.  Progress and results  The \\"Strike Hard\\" campaign was launched during the early stage of legal re-construction in China when the legal system had been almost destroyed in the Cultural Revolution. The criminal law of China came into effect in 1980 and the new Constitution of China was passed in 1982; subsequently, the campaign was formally launched in September 1983 and lasted until January 1987, receiving support from Deng Xiaoping. There were three main battles of the \\"Strike Hard\\" campaign. In total, some 197,000 criminal groups were cracked down, 1.772 million people were arrested, 321,000 were re-educated through labor and 1.747 million people received legal punishment, with 24,000 sentenced to death (mainly in the first battle), which had an immediate positive effect on public safety. A number of people arrested (some even received death penalty) were children or relatives of government officials at various levels, including the grandson of Zhu De, demonstrating the principle of \\"all are equal before the law\\".  Controversies  However, some of the cases in the campaign were actually \\"unjust, false, wrongful cases\\" and some people received overly harsh punishments, resulting in legal controversies, in addition to the fact that the long-term effect of \\"Strike Hard\\" campaign on improving public safety has been widely disputed.

The ship had been built by Blohm & Voss for Turkish operators, taken over after completion by the German government. After World War 2 it taken over by the British and then the Soviet Government. Description The ship was long, with a beam of and a depth of . She was assessed at , . The ship was powered by a 6-cylinder triple expansion steam engine, which had 2 cylinders each of , and diameter by stroke. The engine drove twin screw propellers via low pressure turbines and a double reduction drive. It was built by Blohm+Voss, and could propel the ship at .  History  The ship was built in 1939 as Doğu at the Blohm und Voss shipyard in Hamburg for the Turkish government organisations Denizbank and Denizyollari Idaresi. Yard Number 520, Doğu was launched on 15 March 1939, the first of three sister ships, the others being Egemen and Savas, and completed on 31 August. The ship had not been commissioned when war broke out in September 1939, was taken over by Germany, with Deutsche Afrika-Linien appointed managers, and renamed Lüderitzbucht. In 1940 the ship was taken over by the Kriegsmarine, who used it as a residential hulk at Flensburg, renaming it Duala in early 1945. Pyotr Velikiy at Odessa in 1964 Still moored at Flensburg in May 1945, Duala was taken as prize by British forces and transferred to the Ministry of War Transport under the name Empire Ock. The United Kingdom Official Number 180588 and code letters GJZD were allocated. The ship's port of registry was London and it was operated under the management of City Line Ltd. In the following year Empire Ock was allocated to the Soviet Union as part of German war reparations. It was given the name Pyotr Velikiy (Russian: \\"Пётр Великий\\", Peter the Great) and registered at Leningrad to the Ministry of the Maritime Fleet. The conversion back to a passenger ship proved to be too expensive, so in 1947 it was given to Poland. After a year-long renovation in the Genoa shipyard, the ship was given the name Jagiełło and Gdynia-America Line colours, but never came to Gdynia. It was the only large passenger ship from the Blohm & Voss shipyard, operated under the Polish flag. For a year she sailed, in cooperation with the Italian shipowner company Cosulich and with a largely Italian crew (only a few officers and specialists were Polish), on the Genoa-Central America-Cuba- Lisbon route. Due to the unprofitable nature of the venture, the ship returned (probably free of charge) to the Soviet flag and to the name Pyotr Velikiy in 1949. It was owned by Black Sea Shipping Company, registered at Odessa, with the Soviet Register number M-2381 and code letters UVSA. Pyotr Velikiy was operated (alongside Gruziya, formerly the Polish MS Sobieski), on Black Sea passenger routes, principally between Odessa, Sochi and Batumi. The ship was withdrawn from service and arrived for demolition by I M Varela Davalillo at Castellón de la Plana, Spain on 20 November 1973.

Commissioned to stand outside the Trocadéro Palace for the 1878 Exposition Universelle, it was completed quickly to be ready in time for the opening of the fair. Well received at the time, it was moved in 1935 to allow for the remodelling of the palace and grounds for the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne. The sculpture was sited near to the before being acquired by the Musée d'Orsay in 1985. It now stands in the esplanade in front of the museum, with two other animal statues from the 1878 exposition.  Description  Rhinocéros is a cast iron sculpture of a male rhinoceros stood on a rock by Henri Alfred Jacquemart. It is sculpted in life-size proportions and measures in height, in width and in length. It is currently located on the esplanade in front of the Musée d'Orsay, on the Rive Gauche in Paris, France. It is exhibited alongside two other contemporary large cast iron sculptures: Emmanuel Frémiet's Jeune Éléphant pris au Piège (\\"Young elephant trapped\\") and Pierre Louis Rouillard's Cheval à la herse (\\"horse with harrow\\").  History  The statue (right) in its original location in front of the Trocadéro Palace The sculpture was one of four commissioned for the 1878 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair held in Paris. Ordered in 1877, the sculptures had to be completed in less time than would usually be allowed due to the opening of the exposition. The sculptor, Jacquemart selected the Nantes foundry of J. Voruz the Elder for the work, which was cast in 1878. The statue was gilded afterwards. The statue was originally sited near to the Trocadéro Palace, which had been built especially for the exposition. The Rhinocéros originally stood at one of four corners of a basin near the Trocadéro, which was filled by a waterfall spilling from the rotunda of the palace's concert hall. The other three corners were also occupied by statues: Frémiet's elephant, Rouillard's horse and an ox by Auguste Cain. Contemporary criticism was positive with JH Lamprey, writing in July 1878, praising the technical knowledge demonstrated by Jacquemart and rating the sculpture as one of the best of the works at the exhibition. Scribners Monthly of June 1879 complimented Jacquemart's attention to detail and modelling skill and wondered how he had made such a large animal decorative. The Rhinocéros remained at the Trocadéro until 1935 when the palace was remodelled into the Palais de Chaillot for the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne. The statue was relocated to a site near the . It was acquired by the Musée d'Orsay in 1985 and, after restoration at the Coubertin foundry in Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse, was put on display in its current location. The Austrian sculptor Arnulf Rainer, writing in 1988, noted that the Rhinocéros looked as if it was pondering \\"some collective prehistoric memory\\".

Manufacturers compensate for this (as well as manufacturing defects) by running chips at slower speeds than they are initially capable of. Causes The main causes of transistor aging in MOSFETs are electromigration and charge trapping. Electromigration is the movement of ions caused by momentum from the transfer of electrons in the conductor. This results in degradation of the material, causing intermittent glitches that are very difficult to diagnose, and eventual failure. Charge trapping is related to time-dependent gate oxide breakdown, and manifests as an increase in resistance and threshold voltage (the voltage needed for the transistor to conduct), and a decrease in drain current. This degrades the chip performance over time, until ultimately the thresholds collapse. Charge trapping occurs in several ways: *Hot carrier injection (HCI) is where electrons gain enough energy to leak into the oxide, becoming trapped there and possibly damaging it. *Random telegraph noise (RTN) can also result, where the drain current fluctuates between several discrete levels, and is worsened with increasing temperature. *Bias temperature instability (BTI) is where charge leaks into the oxide when current is applied to the gate, even with no current flowing through the transistor. When the current is removed from the gate, the charges gradually disappate between milliseconds or hours. Charge trapping was determined by John Szedon and Ting L. Chu to be a viable means of storing digital information, and was developed into the SONOS, MirrorBit, and 3D NAND flash memory technologies.

She is the former executive director of the Lookout Emergency Aid Society in Burnaby and co-founder of the BC Shelter Network. Early life O’Shannacery was born in 1950 in Vancouver, British Columbia. At the age of 14, she ran away from her home in Richmond to escape her violent, alcoholic father and general poverty. After staying at various friends' houses in her hometown, she hitchhiked to numerous cities including Toronto and San Francisco. As a youth living on the street, she became involved in drugs and the sex trade industry to find suitable living accommodations. When O’Shannacery returned to Vancouver, she lived in the Downtown Eastside due to their affordable housing and made money selling copies of The Georgia Straight. As she was a minor, O’Shannacery was determined to avoid detection by law enforcement and picked up tips for survival from other youth on the street. She earned enough money selling drugs and The Georgia Straight to buy her own apartment and have her brother move in with her. Career At the age of 18, O’Shannacery was offered a position working at a youth shelter from her friend Mike McKenzie. She accepted the offer under the guise she would be helping troubled youth, but the teenagers using the shelter were often not at-risk and were simply \\"traveling and having fun before going back to their parents\\". However, she noticed that older men on the street were not allowed into the shelter or provided with aid, in spite of their lack of options. This lack of access to adequate aid or shelter for homeless individuals promoted her to begin an outreach program. Using a six- month grant from the government, O’Shannacery and a co-worker hired six men and women to work with them and used the remaining money to rent a room every night at the Patricia Hotel. The room contained two beds, one rollaway cot, and various volunteers offering blankets and support. They named their outreach program Lookout Emergency Aid Society because their goal was to “look out” for the people on the street. Once the room was secured, she would then roam the streets looking for homeless individuals and persuade them to come back to the hotel overnight. In 1973, O’Shannacery became a founding member of the Vancouver Urban Core Community Workers Association while continuing to grow the Lookout Emergency Aid Society. Her advocacy work allowed her to use grant money from the government to grow her outreach program out of the hotel. The society moved into various apartments and hotel rooms before earning a large government grant to built their own shelter on Alexander Street at the end of the era. During the 1980s, the British Columbia Social Credit Party began to cut funding for homeless shelters and outreach programs. This led to a 100-person protest at the Carnegie Centre on the last day of the $50 grant for welfare recipients. During the protest, O’Shannacery stated that the Lookout Emergency Aid Society was sending people via cab to hospitals for first aid as a result of the cut to funding. Human Resources Minister Grace McCarthy claimed this was an \\"over-reaction\\" and that the Community Involvement Program made little impact on the lives of disabled individuals. In 2006, O’Shannacery co-founded the BC Shelter Network. A few years later, O’Shannacery received the Order of British Columbia for her dedication to homeless advocacy. In 2014, O’Shannacery announced her retirement from the Lookout Emergency Aid Society after 43 years. At the time of her retirement, the Lookout Emergency Aid Society was providing homes, transitional housing, and shelters for over 900 people. Two years later, she presided over The Burnaby Task Force on Homelessness, which turned into a non-profit called The Society To End Homelessness In Burnaby. During the same year, O’Shannacery received the British Columbia Civic Merit Award. As president of The Society To End Homelessness In Burnaby, she oversaw the establishment of the first building for the homeless in Burnaby in 2019. The $10-million project would ensure 52 people had access to adequate shelter and aid inside the three- storey modular building. O’Shannacery was also named to the National Advisory Committee on Homelessness in 2019. Personal life O’Shannacery is married to Mike Landiek and they have one child together.

Fought just outside the Royalist garrison of Denbigh, it has been described as probably the only action in the North Wales theatre of the war \\"meriting the description of battle\\". In a last-ditch attempt to relieve the strategic port of Chester, Royalist cavalry commander Sir William Vaughan ordered the mustering of around 2,000 men, drawn from garrisons across Shropshire and north-east Wales, at Denbigh Green. Before gathering all his forces he was attacked by a larger Parliamentarian force under Thomas Mytton and Michael Jones; after a hard-fought action, the Royalists were routed and dispersed. Background=Strategic situation The last substantial Royalist field army was destroyed at Naseby in June 1645. Following a failed attempt to link up with Royalists in Scotland, and with his supporters increasingly confined to a series of small garrisons in the West of England and Wales, Charles I pinned his hopes on reinforcement from Ireland. This required holding the strategic port of Chester, where Lord Byron's garrison had been intermittently blockaded since December 1644. The siege resumed in earnest in September under Sir William Brereton. A Royalist attempt to relieve the city was defeated on 24th September at Rowton Heath, following which Charles ordered Sir William Vaughan, an experienced cavalryman who had served in Ireland until 1644, to return to Wales with the remains of his brigade and gather forces for another relief attempt. Royalists gather Vaughan hurriedly began to assemble men at Ludlow from a variety of garrisons, including Ludlow itself, Bridgnorth and High Ercall. His force eventually included remnants of at least ten regiments, though the collapse in Royalist supply lines meant they were poorly armed: it was reported that of the cavalry \\"scarce a tenth man hath a pistol\\". By mid-October he had potentially 2,000–3,000 horse available, and issued an order for a general rendezvous with the foot within sight of Salesbury's Royalist garrison at Denbigh Castle. Vaughan's force was seen marching north near Corndon Hill. Vaughan's forces and their probable destination were reported to Brereton as they marched north over Corndon Hill. He ordered 1,500 horse and a similar number of infantry detached from the siege of Chester to engage them, under Colonel Michael Jones and Adjutant-General James Lothian. Jones reached Ruthin on 30th October, where Thomas Mytton, the Parliamentarian commander for North Wales, assumed overall command. Vaughan's advance guard had reached Chirk Castle, where they picked up a few additional infantry, on the morning of 23rd October, Vaughan himself arriving by 26th. By 31st October, Vaughan was encamped on Denbigh Green, an open four-mile tract of commonland outside the town, where he received news Mytton had left Ruthin. Most forces ordered to the rendezvous from the North Wales garrisons had yet to arrive and diarist Richard Symonds, a volunteer with Vaughan, counted the Royalist cavalry at just 700, although this may have been exclusive of several hundred lightly armed Irish. Despite the option of withdrawing to the Royalist stronghold of Rhuddlan Vaughan chose to stand and fight, a \\"suicidal\\" decision given the odds. The alarm was sounded for Mytton's approach along the Ruthin road at noon the following day. Vaughan positioned his musketeers and dragoons along the roadside hedges near the church of St. Marcella, or \\"Whitchurch\\", while the main body of cavalry were drawn up on open ground to the west of the road; Mytton responded by detaching a \\"forlorn hope\\" of 40 musketeers to precede his advance guard. The battle St Marcella's Church was where the initial fighting took place. The battle opened with Mytton's forlorn hope and advance guard attempting to dislodge Vaughan's men from the hedges at Whitchurch. Symonds noted that \\"their approach was handsomely disputed by our horse and foot above an howre in the hedges and lane\\". Finding that his men \\"could not breake in upon them, but trifled out the time\\", Mytton left his advance guard in place while making a flanking manoeuvre with the rest of his forces. This involved a \\"laborious detour\\" of several miles to reach the Green, but resulted in Vaughan pulling back some of his men to face the new threat. Dislodged from their defensive positions, the Royalist infantry broke and fled towards Denbigh castle. Salesbury later wrote to Vaughan \\"On your Foot being perceived under the Castle wall, I received them in [...] their valour and good service withall meriting my compassion\\". Mytton brought forward the Warwick and Derbyshire Horse, who charged the Royalist cavalry. Vaughan managed to reform them around two miles from the church on Denbigh Green, where they were charged again. Some dragoons of the High Ercall garrison, supported by troopers of Prince Maurice's Lifeguard, countercharged and briefly checked Mytton's advance, but following a third charge the Royalists broke. The pursuit of the defeated cavalry went on over 8 miles; over 100 Royalists were killed and 400 captured, and the remainder broken up into scattered groups. One party was finally brought to bay at Llangernyw, where the dead were interred in a mass grave in the churchyard. Vaughan and a large group reached Llanrwst before quartering at Gwydir, home of Richard Wynn, which they pillaged. In the interim Mytton occupied the town of Denbigh, though lacking siege equipment he could not take the castle; Salesbury was to continue to hold out until October 1646. With his objective of scattering Vaughan's force complete, Mytton retired to continue the siege of Chester. Aftermath After Mytton's departure Vaughan regrouped at Denbigh, where he was rejoined by his infantry, before retreating southwards. Symonds recorded that they reached Newtown by 10th November and Knighton, \\"a pretty towne\\", the next day. On 12th the group broke up, \\"Prince M[aurice's] guards to Bewdley, Bridgnorth horse thither, the rest with Sir William V. to Lemster\\". Vaughan was to make one final attempt to rebuild a relief force for Chester, but with supplies exhausted Byron was to capitulate in January 1746. Vaughan instead combined his remaining men with those of Jacob Astley; this last effective Royalist field army was eventually destroyed at Stow-on-the-Wold in March.

England is a physiologist and biophysicist and the Alan A. and Edith L. Wolff Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. England conducts research on cation channels in uterine smooth muscle to understand the biological correlates of preterm birth and is the Associate Program Director of the Prematurity Research Center at Washington University as well as the Vice Chair of Research for the Center for Reproductive Health Sciences. In 2005, England was selected as a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Fellow in the Office of Senator Hillary Clinton where she used her scientific expertise in obstetrics and gynaecology to guide policy changes.  Early life and education  England was born in St. Paul, Minnesota. Her family moved to the Highland Park neighbourhood in 1969 after the Fair Housing Act was passed so that England and her four brothers could obtain a better quality education. England's father was a physician and her mother worked in real estate and they made sure that education was a priority in the family. England had always loved science, and decided to pursue a career in academia instead of medicine. In 1984, England pursued her undergraduate degree at Carleton College, a small private liberal arts college in Northfield, Minnesota. She majored in biology and conducted research under the mentorship of John W. Osborn at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul studying the sympathetic nervous system response after barodenervation. This led to her first publication in the American Journal of Physiology in 1990. England completed her Bachelor of Arts in 1988, and then in 1989, she pursued her graduate training in physiology at the Medical College of Wisconsin. She studied under the mentorship of Nancy J. Rusch exploring the role of cation channels in hypertension. She found that calcium dependent potassium channel function is aberrant in specific patches of arterial muscle in rats in rats with genetic hypertension. The potassium channels had a higher probability of open-state leading to increased potassium permeability and overall dysregulation of membrane excitability and contraction. England completed her graduate studies in 1993. Following her graduate work, England pursued her postdoctoral work at Vanderbilt University under the mentorship of Michael M. Tamkun in the Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics. She continued to study voltage-gated potassium channel biophysics, exploring the role they play in smooth muscle tone in the vascular system and how their activity is implicated in blood pressure regulation. She published a first author paper in the Proceedings of the National Academia of Sciences in 1995 characterizing the presence and functionality of beta subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels in human heart tissue. Her findings highlighted the possibility that potassium current diversity in the heart is in part due to the function and expression of beta subunits for voltage-gated potassium channels. She also discovered a novel potassium channel beta subunit, cloned from human heart tissue. She found that this beta-subunit she discovered is generated from alternative splicing of a beta-subunit gene which gives rise to two other previously discovered beta- subunits. Her discovery of alternative splicing mechanisms suggests that potassium channel current diversity and heart tissue excitability diversity may be in part due to alternative splicing events. England completed her postdoctoral training in 1997.  Career and research  In 1997, England was appointed to the faculty at the University of Iowa, becoming an Assistant Professor in the Carver College of Medicine in the Departments of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics. While at U of I, England turned her research focus towards exploring ion channel function in the uterus during pregnancy. England became a Full Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, and well as a full professor in pediatrics. She was also appointed special assistant to the Vice President of Medical Affairs at U of I. England lead many educational programs to enhance diversity and inclusion in the institute. England became a Co- Director of the Iowa Biosciences Advantage Program, which is a National Institutes of Health funded program that aims to increase the participation and recruitment of minority students in biomedical graduate degrees. In addition to being a student mentor in the program, England worked hard to improve the program and make it an established and mainstay program at U of I. From 2005–2006, England took a one-year leave from her roles at the University of Iowa to become a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Fellow in the Office of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Capitol Hill. During this time, she helped draft legislations on issues related to her research on preterm birth and pregnancy, efficiently linking her science to policy changes. She also focused much of her fellowship work to policies more generally surrounding maternal child health, women's health, and health disparities. In 2011, England joined the faculty at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. She became a Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, as well as the Vice Chair of Research for the Center for Reproductive Health Sciences and in 2015, was appointed the Alan A. and Edith L. Wolff Professor of Medicine. Funded by the March of the Dimes, England serves as Associate Program Director and Theme 3 Leader of the Prematurity Research Center at Washington University, working with a team of researchers across the university and across the world to end prematurity. England is also the Principal Investigator of the England Lab where she explores the physiology of ion channels in smooth muscle as a means to target these mechanisms in muscle diseases. She focuses on both vascular and uterine smooth muscle, with a specific focus on the implications of uterine ion channels in preterm birth. One of her projects explored the localization and activity of BK channels and how they alter myometrial excitability and uterine contractility.  Oxytocin and labor  Another facet of England's research program focuses on the role of oxytocin in uterine contractility and how variations in response to oxytocin might lead to labor dysfunction. Oxytocin is a frequently used drug is obstetrics and gynaecology, and England was interested in exploring the safety of this frequent practice by characterizing women who require high doses of oxytocin for adequate cervical dilation during labor. They found that factors associated with higher necessary oxytocin dose were correlated with poor labor progress. Since this study highlighted the need to look at genetic variation in women requiring high oxytocin levels during labor, England and her team conducted a large scale genetic analysis finding that women requiring high doses of oxytocin had enriched levels of a novel oxytocin receptor variant. The variants of oxytocin receptor that were predicted to interfere with oxytocin binding were enriched in women that required higher doses of oxytocin during pregnancy. In a following study, England and her team explored how oxytocin increases the excitability of smooth muscle in the uterus and she found that it inhibits the SLO2.1 potassium channels to modulate electrical activity.  Chronodisruption and preterm birth  England has also began an investigation of the role of chronobiology on preterm birth, through the Prematurity Research Center at WUSTL. The goal of this program is explore how disruptions to circadian rhythm affect the risk of preterm birth. England and Erik D. Herzog, a colleague at Washington University who studies chronobiology, explored how daily rhythms change in pregnancy. They found that the time of onset and the amount of activity changes throughout pregnancy in both mice and women. They are now exploring whether polymorphisms in genes that affect circadian rhythms lead to increased susceptibility of preterm births.  Awards and honors  * 2015 Alan A. and Edith L.

Background and education Namuyimbwa, whose real name is Latifah Nalukenge, was born on 27 December 1989, at Zana, along Kampala–Entebbe Road. She attended Midland Primary School, in Kawempe, a neighborhood in Northern Kampala, Uganda's capital city. She dropped out of Senior 2 (equivalent of Final Year in Middle School), allegedly due to lack of school fees. It is not clear which secondary school she was attending. Career as a prostitute In her own courthouse testimony, under oath, Shanita became a prostitute in 2005. Prior to that, she had tried several different trades, including hawking merchandise on the streets of Kampala. According to Shanita, she averaged US$200 a day, servicing three clients every 24 hours on average. Weekends were better than weekdays. She targeted Caucasian men \\"because they had dollars, which I was most interested in\\". She operated mainly from Kampala Speke Hotel Shanita Namuyimbwa meets David Greenhalgh In June 2009 at the Rock Gardens in Speke Hotel, in central Kampala, Shanita Namuyimbwa, age 19.5 years met David Greenhalgh, age 51 years, a married British businessman from Burgess Hill, West Sussex, England and a father of two. The two developed a mutual attraction and exchanged telephone numbers. Later they had drinks and spent the night together after negotiating and agreeing on a price. In a period of a few months, the relationship blossomed from a commercial sex affair to a mistress affair. He opened bank accounts in her name, both in Uganda Shillings and United States Dollars. He bought her a house in Munyonyo, an upscale neighborhood of Kampala, on the northern shores of Lake Nalubaale (formerly Lake Victoria). He funded joint trips for both of them to exotic destinations, including Nairobi, Kenya and Dubai, United Arab Emirates. He also deposited and had other people deposit over US$4 million in the bank accounts to which she was a signatory. Namuyimbwa became pregnant by David Greenhalgh. Legal trouble In late 2011, less than 18 months after they first met, David Greenhalgh filed a case of Embezzlement against Namuyimbwa. Jointly charged with her was one Meddie Ssentongo, a Kampala businessman. Hearing of the case before Justice Catherine Bamugemereire, kicked off in February 2012, at the Anti Corruption Division of the High Court of Uganda, in Kampala. In July 2012, Shanita was convicted of embezzling USh11 billion (US$3,824,130 at that time), from the bank account of Davishan Development Uganda Limited, a company where Greenhalgh owned 75 percent shareholding and Namuyimbwa owned 25 percent. Shanita's co-accused, Medi Ssentongo was convicted of conspiring to defraud the company. The judge sentenced Namuyimbwa to four years in prison for embezzlement and Medi Ssentongo was sentenced to 18 months in prison for conspiracy to defraud. Life after prison After she served her four year sentence, she was released from prison on 14 March 2016. None of the nearly US$3.9 million that she was convicted of embezzling was recovered. Other brushes with the law included her arrest at Kigali International Airport in October 2013, on an Interpol arrest warrant, for jumping bail in Kampala. She was extradited back to Uganda. In 2020, during the lock down to contain the spread of Covid 19, Bad Black made a video recording of herself urging other prostitutes in the country to avoid contact with long-distance truck drivers, who have exhibited a high prevalence rate of the disease among them. The Uganda Ministry of Health was of the view that her appearance was pro bono, but she insisted that she should be paid for her appearance. When payment was not forthcoming, she threatened to start releasing names of high-ranking government officials who have used her services. Eventually she received payment for her services through Balaam Barugahare, a music promoter. Bad Black acknowledged being paid. The amount of the payment was not disclosed. Family As of August 2020, Namuyimbwa was the mother of three children: 1. A daughter born circa 2007, whose father is a Ugandan of African descent 2. A son born in January 2010, whose father is a Portuguese of Caucasian descent and 3. A son born in May 2012, whose father is David Greenhalgh, a British citizen of Caucasian descent. All three men were at one time clients of the children's mother.

The team is funded exclusively through donations and fundraising and responds to about 100 call outs by the Derbyshire Police and East Midlands Ambulance Service every year. It is one of the seven member teams of the Peak District Mountain Rescue Organisation (PDMRO). The purpose of PDMRO is \\"to save life and alleviate distress, primarily in Upland and Mountain areas\\". This is achieved by conducting search and rescue missions for walkers, climbers and missing persons in and around the Peak District National Park. Buxton MRT and the PDMRO were both established in 1964 following the deaths of three young scouts during a blizzard on the Four Inns Walk in 1964. Previously, from the 1940s until the 1960s, the Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service for the Peak District was based at Harpur Hill in Buxton. On 3 November 1948 the RAF team was called out to locate the US Air Force (USAF) Boeing RB-29A Superfortress which had crashed near Bleaklow moor on the Kinder Scout moorland plateau. All 13 crew perished in the tragedy and the crashed plane became known as the Bleaklow Bomber. Much of the wreckage is still visible at the crash site, where a memorial was erected in 1988.

The peninsula is formed almost entirely from a faulted and folded sequence of Carboniferous rocks though both the earlier Old Red Sandstone and later New Red Sandstone are also present. Gower lay on the southern margin of the last ice sheet and has been a focus of interest for researchers and students in that respect too. Cave development and the use of some for early human occupation is a further significant aspect of the peninsula's scientific and cultural interest. Overview of the geological history of the region The collision of the micro-continent of Avalonia with the Laurentian continent during the middle Palaeozoic caused the Caledonian orogeny which led to the formation and rapid erosion of sizeable mountain ranges across what is now the north of Britain. The Old Red Sandstone seen in Gower, as elsewhere in South Wales and beyond, is the debris brought south by rivers as these mountains eroded rapidly during the Devonian period. From the start of the Carboniferous period, South Wales lay beneath a shallow tropical sea in which over a 30 million year period, a succession of lime rich sediments accumulated, manifest today as the Carboniferous Limestone of Gower and other parts of the region. Subsequently deltas extended across the area first from the north and then the south, leaving a thick pile of mud and sand and pebbles, traditionally recognised as the Millstone Grit Series, though referred to today as the Marros Group in South Wales. The expansion of tropical forests across the region at the end of the Carboniferous period and their periodic demise through sea level fluctuations left the coal seams of the South Wales Coalfield, a basin which extends through the northern part of the peninsula. At this time, a further continental collision had started to the south; South Wales was on the northern margin of this mountain building event, the Variscan orogeny, evidence for which is seen in the relatively intense faulting and folding of the rocks along the Glamorgan Coast, through Gower and into Pembrokeshire. A period of uplift and weathering followed, much of the detail of which remains speculative in Gower and elsewhere in Wales, before the region was once again intermittently inundated by the sea. A series of marine erosion platforms, as seen in the present-day landscape of Gower, were carved at some time during this period, prior to the onset of a series of ice ages during the last 2.6 million years, the Quaternary period. The southern edge of the last ice sheet lay across Gower. Cave development took place in this period and the human influence on the landscape has become more dominant from the first evidence of human occupation of caves on what is now the peninsula’s south coast, through to the industrial period commencing in the 18th century. Devonian The Old Red Sandstone which characterises the Brecon Beacons inland is also present in Gower. The lowermost strata are exposed at the back of Rhossili Bay beneath Rhossili Down. Overlying these are the brown sandstones with thin mudstones of the Brownstones Formation. This formation is unconformably overlain by the Upper Old Red Sandstone, represented in Gower by the Pennard Conglomerate Formation. Outcrops of both are found in a narrow outcrop along Cefn Bryn and at Rhossili Down, Llanmadoc Hill and Hardings Down. There is a further exposure of the conglomerate at Ryer’s Down. Carboniferous=Carboniferous Limestone The early part of the Carboniferous period (359 - 330 million years ago) saw the deposition of a considerable thickness of limestones of differing characteristics in Gower and the wider region. Many of the formations into which the Pembroke Limestone Group is divided, and which are in use across the country, take their name from localities in Gower due to the superb exposure within the southern coastal cliffs which more readily enables details of their stratigraphy to be worked out. The Carboniferous Limestone Supergroup is represented in Gower by the following named divisions (in stratigraphical order, i.e. youngest/uppermost at top): *Pembroke Limestone Group **Oystermouth Formation **Oxwich Head Limestone Formation **Hunts Bay Oolite Sub-group (formerly a 'group') ***Stormy Limestone Formation ***Cornelly Oolite Formation **High Tor Limestone Formation **Caswell Bay Mudstone Formation (formerly member of above) **Gully Oolite Formation (formerly Caswell Bay Oolite) **Black Rock Limestone Sub-group (formerly a 'group')(a.k.a. 'Penmaen Burrows Limestone') ***Friars Point Limestone Formation ***Brofiscin Oolite Formation ***Barry Harbour Limestone Formation *Avon Group (formerly the Lower Limestone Shale Group or Cefn Bryn Shales) The larger part of the sequence is limestone, some of it ooidal, some of it bioclastic, whilst mudstones characterise the Oystermouth Formation (formerly known as the Upper Limestone Shale) and the Avon Group (formerly known as the Lower Limestone Shale). Confusingly, a large number of different names for parts of this sequence are encountered in the geological maps and literature of Gower and wider South Wales, reflecting the state of knowledge at the different times when rocks were surveyed. The limestone occurs at or near the surface, south of a line drawn from Oystermouth west-northwest through Gower to Whiteford Sands. it is however buried beneath superficial deposits, glacial till in many inland areas and coastal deposits in the northwest. The finest and most extensive exposures are along the south coast from Mumbles Head to Worms Head but often wooded inland exposures exist westwards from Llanrhidian towards the coastal exposures at Hills Tor and Burry Holms. The coastal cliffs between Overton Mere near Port Eynon and Fall Bay are formed in the High Tor Limestone, as are the 'three cliffs' at Three Cliffs Bay. Marros Group Overlying the limestone are the rocks of the Marros Group, formerly known as the Millstone Grit Series. Though present elsewhere in the region, the Twrch Sandstone Formation is absent in Gower, leaving the Aberkenfig and Bishopston Mudstone formations as the only two within this group represented locally. Towards the top of the Bishopston Mudstone, a number of sandstones are present, collectively referred to as the Llanelen Sandstones Member. Marros Group rocks occur as a mile wide band stretching from West Cross on the coast just north of Oystermouth, through Barland Common just north of Bishopston and thence via Pengwern Common to Llan-Elen and Cilifor Top where these rocks are exposed. There is a further outlier within the syncline at Oxwich Bay, extending inland as far as Knelston. Coal Measures and Pennant Sandstone The end of the Carboniferous period saw the deposition of the mudstones, sandstones and of course coal seams of the South Wales Coal Measures Group and the thick sandstones of the overlying Warwickshire Group. The Lower Coal Measures occur in a mile wide band running WNW from Sketty beneath Upper Killay to Wernffrwd though are little exposed. The Middle and Upper Coal Measures run in a parallel narrower band from beneath Swansea University to the coast at Crofty. Further north again, the stratigraphically lower parts of the Pennant Sandstone, a division of the Warwickshire Group form slightly higher ground along the margin of peninsular Gower such as that at Three Crosses. Structure Gower is within the northern part of the Variscan orogen, that is its rocks were affected by the Variscan orogeny which took place in late Carboniferous/early Permian times. The main structural trend is ESE-WNW with a series of folds and thrust faults present across the peninsula. The main axis of the east-west aligned South Wales Coalfield syncline passes just to the north of the Gower where it is named as the Pont Lliw and Llanelli synclines east and west of the Loughor estuary respectively. The syncline 'tightens' westwards, resulting in the northward dip of the rocks of much of the peninsula towards that axis, being steeper than further east in the main part of the coalfield. The dip is reversed to the south of the Cefn Bryn anticline which runs ESE-WNW through Gower, whilst further folds, particularly in the southwest, affect the strata locally. A series of north-northeasterly directed thrust faults are associated with the fold structures, together bringing about a degree of crustal shortening as would be expected with the lateral compression of the crust effective during the continental collision. Triassic A small outlier of a red conglomerate from this period underlies part of the village of Port Eynon. Quaternary=Pleistocene Glacial till from the late Devensian glaciation is widespread in the interior. Sand and gravel representing ice-contact glaciofluvial deposits are found around Sketty and Oystermouth with isolated pockets of the same deposits scattered across other parts of Gower. Raised beach and cave deposits and erosional benches within the cliffs relate to varying sea-levels through the Pleistocene and have been the subject of a lot of research. A continuing topic of academic debate is the position of the ice margin during the last ice age with several models having been presented over the years. A ridge of weathered material which extends along the plateau surface in the southwest has been postulated to be an end-moraine of the Anglian Glaciation though doubt persists as to its age. Besides serving as a Neolithic dolmen, Arthur's Stone (Welsh: Maen Ceti) is sometimes interpreted as a Twrch Sandstone glacial erratic dropped by 'Welsh ice' high on Cefn Bryn during the last ice age, after being transported south by at least 20km. Estimates of the late Devensian ice thickness on Gower vary between 200 and 300m. Holocene Along the coast are extensive dune systems, post-glacial accumulations of blown sand, notably at Hillend Burrows, Llangennith Burrows and Broughton Burrows around Rhossili Bay and further north at Whiteford Burrows. Further sand deposits occur at Port Eynon and again at Oxwich Burrows, Michaelston Burrows and Pennard Burrows around Oxwich Bay. Though affected by urban development there are also sand deposits along the east coast from Black Pill eastwards to Swansea, behind the modern tidal flats. Extensive salt marshes along the north coast represent substantial build-ups of marine mud, clay and silt. Inland narrow bands of alluvium floor the narrow incised valleys with wider extents at Oxwich Bay and Llangennith Moors.

On the outbreak of war, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate batteries, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. Eventually these too were prepared for overseas service and 3rd Line reserve units were formed to produce reinforcement drafts to the others.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. The duplicate 2/VII London Brigade was formed in September 1914.Dalbaic, pp. 17–8.Frederick, p. 691. 1/VII London Brigade At the end of October 1914 the 2nd London Division was chosen to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) fighting on the Western Front and training was stepped up, despite bad weather and equipment shortages. Brigade and divisional training began in February 1915 and it received its orders for the move to France on 2 March. By 22 March all the batteries had reached the divisional concentration area around Béthune.Farndale, Western Front, p. 94.Maude, pp. 3, 11–12. =Aubers Ridge= While the division's infantry were introduced to trench routine by being attached in groups to the 1st and 2nd Divisions holding the line, the TF field batteries with their obsolescent 15-pounders were interspersed with those of the two Regular divisions equipped with modern 18-pounder guns. However, ammunition was very scarce, and the guns were restricted to three rounds per gun per day during April. Ammunition was being saved up for the Battle of Aubers Ridge on 9 May, when the 15-pounders of 1/VII London Bde joined with the guns of 1st and 2nd Divisions and the Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) to cut the barbed wire for the assault by 1st Division. The bombardment began at 05.00 with Shrapnel shell, then at 05.30 the guns switched to High Explosive (HE) shell to join the howitzers already firing at the German breastworks. At 05.40 the guns lifted to targets further back and the infantry moved to the attack. The attackers ran into devastating machine gun fire (there was no artillery barrage to suppress the defenders) and they found that the wire was inadequately cut and the breastworks barely touched. The inexperienced artillery had failed in all its tasks. A renewed bombardment was ordered from 06.15 to 07.00, but the artillery's forward observation officers (FOOs) were unable to locate the hidden German machine gun positions, which required a direct hit from an HE shell to be put out of action. The second attack failed as badly as the first, as did two others launched during the afternoon, and the survivors were pinned down in No man's land until nightfall, despite a further bombardment being laid on to allow them to withdraw.Edmonds, 1915, Vol II, pp. 6, 17–29, 39.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 103–7.Maude, pp 12–3. =Festubert= Although 2nd London Division suffered few casualties at Aubers Ridge, its gunners had learned a sobering lesson about the impossibility of suppressing strong defences with inadequate guns and shells. On 11 May the division was redesignated 47th (1/2nd London) Division, and on the night of 14/15 May it took its place in the line for the Battle of Festubert. The guns were already in place, with 47th Divisional Artillery operating under the control of 7th Division. Despite the continuing shortage of ammunition, the plan this time was for a long methodical bombardment. On 13 and 14 May the field guns carried out three two-hour deliberate bombardments each day, attacking the wire with slow observed fire or keeping the enemy communication trenches under fire. At night they carried out intermittent bombardments of the communication trenches and defences, to stop supplies being brought up and to prevent repairs being carried out. The guns fired about 100 rounds per day. During 15 May feint bombardments mimicking the moment of assault were carried out, but the actual attack was made after dark with some success. The fighting went on for several days, and 47th (2nd L) Division made its own first attack on the night of 25 May. The leading brigade captured the German front and support trenches, but was then pinned down by accurate German artillery fire and could advance no further. This effectively ended the battle. The heavy rate of fire during the battle was too much for the old 15-pdrs: by 26 May, 11 out of 36 guns in the division were out of action.Edmonds, 1915, Vol II, pp. 44–76.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 107–10.Maude, pp. 14–20. =Loos= In June 47th (2nd L) Division took over trenches in front of Loos-en-Gohelle from the French. In August the divisional artillery was rested for the first time since March, and the brigade began training on the 18-pounder for when these became available. The Loos sector had been selected for the next major British attack (the Battle of Loos), to which part of 47th (2nd L) Division would provide the southern 'hinge'. 1/VII London Bde with its obsolescent guns was not assigned a major role in the complex artillery plan, and it remained in reserve behind the attack of 140th (4th London) Brigade except for two batteries; of these a section of 1/19th Bty was attached to 15th (Scottish) Divisional Artillery. Supported by poison gas clouds, the attacking portion of 47th (2nd L) Division made good progress towards its limited objective, and 15th (S) Division had almost broken through, though it had failed to take Hill 70. However, events had not played out so well further north at the Hohenzollern Redoubt, and the battle raged on after 47th (2nd L) Division had been relieved between 28 September and 1 October.Cherry, pp. 41, 109–22.Edmonds, 1915, Vol II, pp. 174–76, 182–91.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 116–23.Maude, pp. 14,25–36. 18-pounder preserved at the Imperial War Museum. On 13 October 47th (2nd L) Division was in support for the final attack on the Hohenzollern Redoubt, and was practising on dummy trenches for a follow-up attack on Hulluch next day, but the results at the Hohenzollern were so disappointing that the operation was cancelled. The division took over the line and the artillery was in constant action over the following weeks. On 6 November 1915 the batteries of 1/VII London Bde were re-equipped with modern 18-pounders, for which they had been training since August; ammunition supply also improved.Maude, pp. 37–41. Colonel Chambers was succeeded as CO by Lt-Col W.E. Peal, DSO, promoted from command of 20th Bty during November.Maude, Appendix D. The division returned to the Loos sector in January 1916, with most of the artillery round Grenay, with Observation Posts (OPs) in the cottages of Maroc. The guns carried out a great deal of counter-battery (CB) work against battery positions in and around Lens. However, there was now a policy of pushing a few guns close up behind the infantry's trenches, and a gun of 1/19th Bty was brought into action from the mine pit (fosse) at Calonne, no more than from the front line, from where it could shoot laterally at the railway triangle east of Loos. 'Although searched for by every type of missile, including trench-mortar bombs, the gun remained in action for several weeks, until the battery left the neighbourhood'.Maude, p. 46. =Spring 1916= On 24 April 1/VII London Bde was joined by an additional 4-gun battery, manned by half of 93rd Bty RFA, a Regular battery that had come to France from India with the 3rd (Lahore) Division and stayed with the BEF when the division went to Mesopotamia. This became R/VII Bty, but only stayed a short time: on 17 May 1916 1/VII London Bde was renumbered CCXXXVII Bde (237 Bde) and the batteries were designated A, B and C; R Bty transferred to CCXXXVIII (formerly VIII London Bde). At the same time the brigade ammunition columns (BACs) were abolished and incorporated into the divisional ammunition column (DAC).Perry, pp. 50–2.Maude, p. 57. In the Spring of 1916 47th (2nd L) Division took over the lines facing Vimy Ridge. Active mine warfare was being conducted by both sides underground. In May the Germans secretly assembled 80 batteries in the sector and on 21 May carried out a heavy bombardment in the morning; the bombardment resumed at 15.00 and an assault was launched at 15.45, while the guns lifted onto the British guns and fired a Box barrage into Zouave Valley to seal the attacked sector off from support. 47th Divisional Artillery reported 150 heavy shells an hour landing on its poorly-covered battery positions and guns being put out of action, while its own guns tried to respond to SOS calls from the infantry under attack, though most communications were cut by the box barrage. During the night the gun pits were shelled with gas, but on 22 May the artillery duel began to swing towards the British, with fresh batteries brought in, despite their shortage of ammunition. A system of 'one round strikes' was introduced: whenever a German battery was identified every gun in range fired one round at it, which effectively suppressed them. British counter-attacks were attempted, but when the fighting died down the Germans had succeeded in capturing the British front line. Throughout their stay in the Vimy sector the batteries suffered heavily from German CB fire.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 210–27.Farndale Western Front, p. 138.Maude, pp. 50–7. =Somme= The two wooden memorial crosses originally erected at High Wood and Eaucourt l'Abbaye by 47th (2nd London) Division in 1916, now at Connaught House in Camberwell. On 1 August 1916 47th (2nd L) Division began to move south to join in the Somme Offensive. While the infantry underwent training with the newly-introduced tanks, the divisional artillery went into the line on 14 August in support of 15th (Scottish) Division. The batteries were positioned in Bottom Wood and near Mametz Wood, and became familiar with the ground over which 47th (2nd L) Division was later to attack, while supporting 15th (S) Division's gradual encroachment on Martinpuich. Casualties among FOOs and signallers was heavy in this kind of fighting. Between 9 and 11 September 47th (2nd L) Division took over the front in the High Wood sector, and on 15 September the Battle of Flers-Courcelette was launched, with tank support for the first time. The barrage fired by the divisional artillery left lanes through which the tanks could advance. However, the tanks proved useless in the tangled tree stumps of High Wood, and the artillery could not bombard the German front line because No man's land was so narrow. Casualties among the attacking infantry were extremely heavy, but they succeeded in capturing High Wood and the gun batteries began to move up in support, crossing deeply- cratered ground. The first to arrive was 1/19th Bty under its commander, Maj Lord Gorell, who brought it up into the shell-hole area immediately behind High Wood. He then made a reconnaissance of the whole divisional front with Maj E.H.Marshall of 1/18th Bty. Lord Gorell was awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for this work. Casualties among the exposed guns and gunners took their toll, but a German counter-attack was broken up by gunfire. Next day the division fought to consolidate its positions round the captured 'Cough Drop' strongpoint. When the infantry were relieved on 19 September the artillery remained in the line under 1st Division.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 150–2.Maude, pp. 61–9.Miles, 1916, pp. 299, 331–3, 344, 352. Bringing up ammunition for an 18-pounder battery during the Battle of the Somme 47th (2nd L) Division came back into the line to relieve 1st Division on 28/29 September, and began attacking Eaucourt L'Abbaye as part of the Battle of the Transloy Ridges, finally securing the ruins on 3 October. This allowed the batteries to cross the High Wood Ridge into a small valley where they remained for the rest of the Somme fighting, helping to cover the unsuccessful attacks by 47th (2nd L) Division and later 9th (Scottish) Division against the Butte de Warlencourt through October. By now the gun lines were crowded together in deep mud, guns sank up to their axles, and getting ammunition through was extremely difficult. The artillery was finally relieved on 14 October and followed the rest of the division to the Ypres Salient.Farndale, Western Front, p. 154.Maude, pp. 69–78.Miles, 1916, pp. 430–43. A further reorganisation of field artillery in the BEF was carried out in November 1916. To increase the batteries of other brigades of the division to six guns each, CCCXXXVII Bde was split up: B battery and half of A battery formed C Battery in CCXXXVI Bde, and C Battery and half of A Battery formed C Battery in CCXXXV Bde. CCXXXVII Brigade's headquarters was abolished on 29 November, and the brigade ceased to exist for the rest of the war. However, the 7th Londons' war memorial in Fulham includes those later battles on the Western Front in which the two successor batteries were engaged. Lord Gorell was mortally wounded on 15 January 1917 when acting as FOO for his battery. 'A pre-war Territorial officer of high professional attainments, and at times almost reckless courage, his loss was universally mourned'.Maude, p. 87. 2/VII London Brigade The 2/2nd London Division came into existence quickly as volunteers rushed to join up. There were no guns or horses for the artillery, but the batteries improvised dummy guns mounted on handcarts, with wooden sights and washing-lines for drag-ropes. Although the Master-General of the Ordnance, Major-General Sir Stanley von Donop, was pleased with their work and promised them the first guns available, it was not until February 1915 that some old 15-pdrs arrived for training. In March 1915 the division took the place of 1/2nd London Division in the St Albans area. At the end of May, now numbered 60th (2/2nd London) Division, it moved into Essex, with the artillery at Much Hadham. Finally, at the end of November it began to receive new 18-pdr guns and towards the end of January 1916 the division moved to the Warminster training area on Salisbury Plain.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 25–32.60th (2/2nd London) Division at Long, Long Trail.Dalbiac, pp. 18–9, 30–1, 35. On 28 April 1916 3/3rd Wessex Bty arrived as a fourth 18-pdr battery for 2/VII London Brigade. Then, as with the TF artillery brigades in the BEF, those in 60th Division were numbered on 17 May, 2/VII Londons taking the number CCCII Brigade (302 Bde), and the batteries were lettered. 3/3rd Wessex Bty was exchanged with 2/22nd (Howitzer) Bty from CCCIII (H) Bde (formerly2/VIII London Bde). This became D (H) Bty, and was equipped with four 4.5-inch howitzers. The BACs were also absorbed into the DAC.Frederick, p. 695. =Western Front= 4.5-inch howitzer preserved at the Royal Artillery Museum. On 14 June 1916 orders arrived for 60th (2/2nd L) Division to move to the Western Front, and the artillery units made the crossing from Southampton to Le Havre between 22 and 26 June, with CCCII Bde under the command of Lt-Col H.M. Drake. The division concentrated in the area behind Arras by 29 June. It relieved 51st (Highland) Division in the line on 14 July, with the artillery moving into position over the next three nights. The line held was facing the same strong German positions along Vimy Ridge that 47th (2nd L) Division had faced, and there was constant mine warfare and trench raiding. The artillery was mostly engaged in suppressing troublesome German trench mortars (Minenwerfers) by firing short concentrated bombardments on specific sectors of the enemy line. Some trench raids were preceded by local wire-cutting bombardments, or by a barrage, others were 'stealth' raids.Dalbiac, pp. 42–62; Appendix I. On 30–31 August the divisional artillery underwent the same reorganisation into six-gun batteries that was going on throughout the BEF. In CCCII Bde this meant A and half of B Bty joined from CCC Bde. However, orders arrived on 1 November for the division to transfer to the Macedonian front (Salonika), where the four- gun establishment was still in force, and the batteries reverted to their original organisation; the BAC was also reformed. Once the brigade was in Macedonia, the six-gun battery establishment was introduced there as well, and this time C Bty was broken up to bring A and B Btys up to six guns each.Dalbiac, pp. 63–5. =Salonika= Entrainment of the artillery for the embarkation port of Marseilles began on 14 November and was a slow business due to lack of facilities: the drivers needed their wooden trench bridges to get their horses aboard the trains. All units were embarked and at sea by 12 December and proceeded to Salonika via Malta. The first part of the division to move out was 179th (2/4th London) Brigade, which went by sea to Katerini to prevent any move by the Greek Army against the base at Salonika. It was followed a few days later by a cross-country column comprising CCCII Bde, the transport and a Troop of the Lothians and Border Horse. Their 'Katerini Trek' was a strenuous six-day march in bad weather, across flooded rivers, but the Salonika–Katerini railway was soon repaired, making supply more straightforward The Greek troops showed no signs of interfering with the Allies' operations, and the brigade group at Katerini marched out on 5 March to join the rest of the division in the Lake Doiran sector in preparation for the Allied Spring offensive. Apart from diversionary raids, 60th (2/2nd L) Division took little part in the first part of this operation (8–9 April), most of its batteries being used to reinforce the main attack near Lake Doiran, which required several days' artillery preparation. The division did attack during the second phase of the offensive (8/9 May), but it captured its objectives by night attacks without preliminary artillery fire. A further advance was made by the division on 15 May, but the rest of the offensive having come to a standstill it was called off on 24 May. On 1 June 1917 the division was marched back to Salonika to embark for Egypt.Dalbiac, pp. 65–104.Wakefield & Moody, pp. 60–1, 69, 85, 94–6. =Palestine= On arrival at Alexandria on 19 June 1917 D (H) Bty transferred to the new 74th (Yeomanry) Division, leaving CCCII Bde with just two batteries until 10 October when 413 (H) Bty arrived to become C (H) Bty (413 (H) Bty was a New Army ('Kitchener's Army') battery formed in 1917 and equipped with four 4.5-inch howitzers).Falls, Vol II, Pt 2, Appendix 3, p. 671.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, p. 90; Annex 1.Frederick, p. 548. On 8 August, the brigade's CO, Lt-Col Drake, was promoted to Brigadier-General, RA, of the division and was succeeded by Lt-Col V.M. Fergusson.Dalbiac, p. 110; Appendix II. From Alexandria, 60th (2/2nd L) Division moved to the Suez Canal to join the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), where its units were reorganised (the BACs were absorbed into the DAC once more) and underwent training before crossing Sinai in early July 1917. Further intensive training followed until late October, when the division made its first full-scale attack of the war, at Beersheba. In the weeks leading up to the attack artillery officers had regularly ridden close to the Beersheba defences to reconnoitre, often under fire. Concentration for the attack was carried out under cover of darkness, beginning on 20/21 October and completed on 28/29 October. The divisional artillery was divided into Right and Left groups corresponding to the two attacking brigades; CCCII Bde was part of Left Group supporting 181st (2/6th London) Brigade. The whole force moved forward under moonlight on 30/31 October, with the Royal Engineers improving the track north of Wadi ed Sabe for the artillery, which was in position by 01.30. At dawn the guns began to bombard Hill 1070, pausing at 07.00 to let the smoke and dust clear. At 08.30 the guns switched from wire- cutting to intensive bombardment, 181st Bde moving forward as the guns lifted, and taking the hill in 10 minutes. As soon as new OPs had been established on the hill the batteries galloped forward over the stony ground to begin wire- cutting on the main Turkish position. The general advance was resumed at 12.15 and 181st Bde captured its objectives easily. By 13.00 the whole of the defence works were in British hands, and that evening the Desert Mounted Corps entered Beersheba.Dalbiac, pp. 106–8, 112–22.Falls, Vol II, Pt I, pp. 46–51. The next phase of the offensive involved 60th (2/2nd L) Division in an attack on Kauwukah in the Turkish Sheria position (the Battle of Hareira and Sheria) on 6 November. The attacking brigades moved forwards at 03.30 with the artillery, which began wire-cutting as soon as it was in position. Each 18-pdr battery cut two gaps in the wire by 12.15, and then began a bombardment of the enemy trench as the attack went in against heavy fire. The field guns then lifted onto the works in the second line. The whole defensive position was in the division's hands by 14.00 and it pushed patrols ahead towards Sheria and its water supply. Sheria was captured at daybreak the following morning, without artillery preparation, but afterwards there was heavy fighting, and several Turkish counter-attacks were broken up by the field guns. The infantry brigade groups continued their advance the following day, supported by their artillery groups (Fergusson's Group supporting 181st Bde in the Right Column), and entered Huj.Dalbiac, pp. 126–35.Falls, Vol II, Pt I, pp. 98–100, 107–9, 119, 122. Drawing by James McBey of an RFA battery engaging Turkish batteries at Nebi Samwil. After a short rest at Huj, the division bivouacked at Gaza under heavy rain, then began a march through the mud to Junction Station, which it reached on 22 November. It now entered the last stage of the Battle of Nebi Samwil, where the objectives were a tangle of hill slopes, with tracks so bad that it was impossible to bring up the guns until roads had been made for them. Nebi Samwil had been captured by units of 75th Division, and the London battalions that relieved them came under fierce counter-attacks on 29 November; only the supporting British artillery fire allowed them to maintain their position. However, the way was now open to attack the final defences of Jerusalem; an encirclement was chosen, to avoid attacking the city itself. The surprise attack began on 8 December without artillery support; once progress had been made the batteries were to move up and come under command of the brigade groups. The going was tough for the gun teams, but CCCII Bde got though and eventually came into action within close rifle range of the enemy. C (H) Battery, together with C (H)/CCCI Bty, came up through Qalonye and supported 180th (2/5th London) Brigade's afternoon attack on the heights above Lifta; the hill was carried with great dash at the point of the bayonet. The division consolidated its gains that evening. The advance was resumed the following morning and the infantry fought their way into the suburbs of Jerusalem; there was little the artillery could do to support them. The Turks evacuated the city and the following morning the mayor and civic leaders surrendered the city to two sergeants of 2/19th Londons.Dalbiac, pp. 142–68.Falls, pp. 124, 126, 208, 218–9, 229, 237, 243–8, 251–2. Monument to the surrender of Jerusalem to 60th (2/2nd London) Division. 60th (2/2nd L) Division was then pushed forward into positions from which to defend the captured city. Turkish counter-attacks began on 22 December, and a major attack followed on the night of 26/27 December. This was beaten off and the division took the opportunity to push forward up the Nablus Road into the hills over the following days. 60th Divisional Artillery made 'extraordinary exertions' to get its guns up to support attacks that captured the heights of Tahuneh and Shab Salah on 29 December. The Nablus Road defences were then garrisoned, with CCCII Bde in reserve.Dalbiac, pp. 178–88.Falls, Vol II, pp. 286–9. There was a pause in operations until February 1918 when the EEF moved to drive the Turks east of the Jordan. 60th (2/2nd L) Division advanced with three brigade groups, each supported by artillery, and worked its way forward between 14 and 21 February over rough country, with Turkish road demolitions needing repair before the guns could get forward. At 02.30 on 21 February 2/14th Londons (London Scottish) were ordered to Nebi Musa, which they reached by 06.00, but it took 38 hours of struggle for a battery of CCCII Bde to cover the same distance. On 21 February the Australian 1st Light Horse Brigade swept into Jericho, leaving the Turks with only small bridgeheads west of the Jordan. CCCII Brigade played no part in the Battle of Tell 'Asur that followed.Dalbiac, pp. 190–7.Falls, Vol II, pp. 303–9. 181st Brigade, with CCCII Bde (less one battery) in support, secured the line of the Wadi el Auja on 9 March. The division then crossed the river on the night of 21 March to carry out the First Transjordan raid. A Pontoon bridge was built at Ghoraniyeh, and the reinforced division advanced as far as Amman, though the field artillery could not get forward in the wet conditions, even with double teams of horses. Without artillery support the division failed to capture the Amman Citadel, and with its communications back to the Jordan threatened, the raiding force withdrew on 30–31 March..Dalbiac, pp. 199–206.Falls, Vol II, pp. 313, 331–48.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 118–20. The EEF settled down to defend its Jordan bridgeheads; CCCI Brigade was posted to support the Australian 2nd Light Horse Brigade and Imperial Camel Corps garrisoning a bridgehead at the Wadi el Auja confluence. The Turks attacked the Auja bridgehead on 11 April but were driven off, the artillery observers on the high ground to the west having 'an admirable view'.Falls, Vol II, pp. 358–61. Later that month the 60th (2/2nd L) Division played its part in the Second Transjordan raid. CCCII Brigade came up in support, but while the mounted troops reached Es Salt the Londoners could not break through the Turkish positions in the foothills, and the raiding force was withdrawn on 4 May. 60th (2/2nd L) Division then went into Corps Reserve for a rest.Dalbiac, pp. 215–9.Falls, Vol II, pp. 365–89.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 122–3. As a result of the German Spring Offensive and consequent British manpower crisis on the Western Front, 60th (2/2nd L) Division was changed between 25 May and 1 August to an Indian Army establishment, releasing three-quarters of its London infantry units for service in France and replacing them with Indian units; however, this did not affect the artillery, which continued to serve with the division in Palestine.Dalbiac, pp. 220–4.Falls, Vol II, pp. 411–21. For the final offensive in Palestine, the Battle of Megiddo, 60th Division was transferred to the coastal sector where the breakthrough was to be made. The opening attack (the Battle of Sharon) went in at 04.30 on 19 September behind an intense artillery bombardment. As soon as the barrage programme was complete, the artillery moved up behind the infantry, who had gained their first objectives. The division then continued its advance as the Turks streamed away in retreat. The 60th Division advanced for the next three days against enemy rearguards until it ran ahead of its supplies.Dalbiac, pp. 224–32.Falls, Vol II, pp. 464, 484–7. After the battle the pursuit was carried out by the mounted troops and 60th Division was left behind on salvage duties. It was still in the rear areas when the Armistice of Mudros ended the war with Turkey on 31 October. The division then went back to Alexandria where demobilisation began and units were gradually reduced to cadres, though still with some responsibility for internal security and seizing illegal arms. The division ceased to exist on 31 May 1919.Dalbiac, p. 233.Falls, Vol II, pp. 623. Interwar The TF was reconstituted on 7 February 1920 and 7th London Bde, RFA, was reformed at Fulham High Street. When the TF was reorganised as the new Territorial Army (TA) the following year, the brigade was redesignated 64th (7th London) Brigade, RFA, with the following organisation:Frederick, p. 518. * HQ at Fulham * 253 (18th London) Battery at Fulham * 254 (19th London) Battery at Shepherd's Bush * 255 (20th London) Battery at Fulham * 256 (17th London) Battery (Howitzer) at Porteus Road, Paddington (transferred from the former 5th London Bde) When the RFA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery (RA) on 1 June 1924, its units were redesignated as 'Field Brigades, RA'. In the reformed TA, 64th (7th London) Field Bde was again part of 47th (2nd London) Division.Titles and Designations, 1927. In 1925 Lt-Col Claude Liardet transferred to the regiment as CO from the command of 106th (Lancashire Yeomanry) Field Bde. He was promoted to Colonel in 1929 and appointed Commander, Royal Artillery (CRA) of 47th Division in 1934.Liardet at Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives. In 1935 most of 47th (2nd London) Division was converted into 1st Anti-Aircraft Division and the remaining London units including 64th Fd Bde were organised with those of 56th (1st London) Division into a single London Division. When the RA adopted the term 'regiment' instead of the obsolete 'brigade' for a lieutenant-colonel's command, the unit became 64th (7th London) Field Regiment, RA, on 1 November 1938. After the Munich Crisis the TA was rapidly doubled in size. On 1 May 1939, 64th (7th London) Field Regiment created a duplicate 117th Field Regiment, RA, at Parsons Green , Fulham, by separating 255 (20th London) and 256 (17th London) Btys (it was officially given the '7th London' subtitle in 1942).Frederick, p. 529. Field regiments were now organised as Regimental HQ (RHQ) and two batteries each of 12 guns. These were 18-pounders of World War I pattern, though now equipped with pneumatic tyres and towed by motorised gun tractors. There was a programme to replace the 18-pdr barrels with that of the new 25-pounder coming into service, giving the hybrid 18/25-pounder.Ellis, France & Flanders, Appendix I. 64th Field Rgt remained with 1st London Division while 117th formed part of the newly-formed 2nd London Division, both divisions being organised as motor divisions.Joslen, pp. 378.Joslen, pp. 41–2.London District 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. World War II 56th (London) Division's formation sign featured Dick Whittington's cat. 64th (7th London) Field RegimentHome Defence= During the Phoney War period 1st London Division (commanded by the 7th Londons' former CO, now Maj-Gen Claude Liardet) was stationed in South East England as part of Eastern Command.Collier, Maps 5, 6, 17, 20. On 5 December 1939 64th Fd Rgt sent a cadre of trained officers and men to St Leonards-on-Sea in Sussex form the basis of a new 56th Heavy Regiment (see below).Frederick, pp. 556, 558. When the defences of the UK were reorganised after the Dunkirk evacuation, the division was reformed as a conventional infantry division, defending the prime invasion area from the Isle of Sheppey in north Kent to Rye, East Sussex, as part of XII Corps, even though it was only partially equipped (its two field artillery regiments had 11 x 18/25-pounders, 4 x 18-pounders and 8 x 4.5-inch howitzers between them, and it had no anti-tank guns). It was redesignated 56th (London) Division in November 1940.Collier, p. 125.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 95. It was only in the autumn of 1940 that the RA began producing enough battery staffs to start the process of changing regiments from a two-battery to a three-battery organisation. (Three 8-gun batteries were easier to handle, and it meant that each infantry battalion in a brigade could be closely associated with its own battery.) 64th Field Rgt formed 444 Bty on 1 April 1941.Farndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 99–100. 56th (L) Division remained in Sussex until April 1942, when it moved to XI Corps in East Anglia. Then in June 1942 it came under direct War Office control as it was prepared for overseas service. =Iraq and North Africa= In August 1942 the division embarked for the Middle East, arriving in Iraq to reinforce Persia and Iraq Command (PAIC) in November. By the time it arrived, the threats to the Persian oilfields had diminished with the British victory at El Alamein and the lack of German progress at the Battle of Stalingrad. The troops in PAIC were, therefore, free to undergo intensive training, and 56th (L) Division was selected for the planned Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky).Playfair, Vol III, pp. 365, 425.Playfair, Vol IV, p. 264. This involved a move from Kirkuk via Palestine and Egypt to join X Corps of Eighth Army in Tunisia, covering approximately between 19 March and 19 April 1943. As soon as it arrived it was thrown into the last stages of the Tunisian Campaign, because Gen Montgomery did not want an untried division in Husky. Given the task of capturing Tarhuna during the night of 28/29 April, it succeeded but was driven off the position the following morning. Montgomery realised that the division needed time to learn battlecraft. It went into action again during the final advance on Tunis (Operation Vulcan), moving north to meet 6th Armoured Division of First Army coming south, whose leading troops were able to spot for X Corps' guns via 56th (L) Division's wireless net.Playfair, Vol IV, pp. 441–2, 453–4.Montgomery, p. 172. =Salerno to Anzio= Because of Montgomery's doubts, 56th Division was not in fact used in Operation Husky. Instead, it moved back to Tripoli in Libya for further training, and then put to sea on 1 September for the invasion of mainland Italy, landing at Salerno on 9 September (Operation Avalanche). H-Hour was at 03.30, the division's leading infantry landing craft touched down at 03.35 covered by naval gunfire, and 64th Fd Rgt's guns began landing at 06.00. The whole regiment was in action at 17.15.Molony, Vol V, pp. 259, 276–7. Over the next few days the division fought its way forward to extend the beachhead against strong German counter- attacks, and the divisional artillery was heavily engaged in defensive fire (DF) tasks.Molony, Vol V, pp. 283–4, 291–2, 296, 310, 321. X Corps began its advance out of the beachhead on the night of 22/23 September with massive artillery support and reached Naples on 30 September.Molony, Vol V, pp. 337–8, 340–1, 343. By 11 October, the division was on the Volturno Line but failed to cross the river the following day and had to wait until 16 October before it could cross and begin the pursuit through rough country beyond.Molony, Vol V, pp. 438, 444–5, 450. This brought the division to the Bernhardt Line, where 64th Fd Rgt lent support to the attack of 201st Guards Brigade up 'Bare Arse Ridge' on 6 November during the during the Battle of Monte Camino.Molony, Vol V, p. 451. Attacks at Monte Camino continued in early December, with large numbers of guns in support, until the division seized the heights on 6 December.Molony, Vol V, pp. 517–8. 56th (L) Division was next tasked with capturing a bridgehead across the Garigliano using strong artillery support (400 rounds per gun were supplied for the division's 25-pounders). The attack on the night of 17/18 January 1944 was successful and by morning the leading battalions were across and attacking with plenty of artillery support.Molony, Vol V, pp. 606–12. The division began its breakout from the bridgehead on 23 January, but at the end of the month was ordered to pull out and go by sea to reinforce the Anzio beachhead. By 15 February the whole division had arrived and taken over part of the line under VI US Corps, in time to beat off the German counter-attack (Operation Fischfang or 'Catching Fish').Molony, Vol V, pp. 635–6, 744–5. Trench warfare in the Anzio bridgehead continued for months. On 28 February the German I Parachute Corps began an offensive against 56th (L) Division that produced no change in the line. When the attack was widened to the front of 3rd US Division the following day, accompanied by unusually heavy support from field artillery, the whole artillery in VI Corps brought down a pre-emptive counter-preparation programme. Although this was too late to catch the German troops as they formed up, the attack made no real impression on the Allied defences.Molony, Vol V, p. 755. 56th (L) Division was by now so weak that it was relieved and on 28 March went by sea to Egypt for recuperation.Molony, Vol V, p. 757.Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, pp. 10, 13. =Italy again= 56th (L) Division returned to Italy on 17 July 1944 and was assigned to V Corps for the attack on the Gothic Line (Operation Olive). When the offensive opened on 25 August 1944, V Corps was still moving up, and 56th (L) Division was its reserve, but its artillery was sent on ahead to strengthen the Corps artillery. Once the Corps had broken into the German positions, 56th (L) Division was used to widen the breach on 1 September, and then on 3 September to lead the pursuit, taking Monte Maggiore before opposition increased at the Gemmano–Coriano high ground. There followed hard methodical fighting to clear the Germans off successive ridge lines (the Battle of San Marino).Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 130, 226, 231, 241, 249–52, 260–1, 267–8, 277. 25-pounder and crew in a waterlogged position across the Rubicon, October 1944. On the night of 27/28 September 56th (L) Division attacked Savignano sul Rubicone on the Fiumicino river, supported by a 90-minute barrage fired by the heavily reinforced divisional artillery. Nevertheless, the attack failed, as did attempts to renew it on 29/30 September and 1 October. Later in October, the badly weakened 56th (L) Division was relieved in the line.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 353–4, 371–2, 402. While the infantry were recuperating, 56th (L) Division's artillery was brought up to reinforce V Corps' fire-plan for the capture of Forlì and the attempted crossings of the Montone on 8 November.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 39–40. 56th (L) Division returned to the fighting in December to cover the Lamone crossing (2–13 December) and then to clear the ground between the Lamone and the Senio, forcing its way into Sant'Andrea on 31 December. However, ammunition shortages limited the use of the artillery.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 120–24, 158. For the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy (Operation Grapeshot), 56th (L) Division was responsible for the operations on Lake Comacchio to outflank the Senio line (5/6, 10/11 and 13 April) allowing it to breach the Argenta Gap (15–19 April) despite the shortage of artillery ammunition.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 215–6, 222, 259–60, 267–8, 271–2, 281–2. Once through the gap, 56th (L) Division drove on through German rearguards to the Po, arriving on 25 April and crossing immediately. The division reached Venice on 29 April. Here it was halted due to shortage of fuel. The Surrender of Caserta came into force on 2 May, ending hostilities in the Italian theatre.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 289–91, 293, 319, 326–8. 56th (L) Division was made responsible for protecting lines of communication to the disputed city of Trieste in the immediate aftermath of the fighting.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, p. 340. 64th (7th London) Field Regiment was placed in suspended animation on 15 May 1946. 117th (7th London) Field Regiment 47th (London) Division's formation sign, a play on Bow Bells. The regiment served with the new 2nd London Division in the UK for the whole war. During the Phoney War period it was stationed to defend London as part of Eastern Command. However, after the Dunkirk the poorly-equipped division was sent to South Wales to continue its training under Western Command. It was redesignated 47th (London) Division in November 1940. 117th Field Rgt formed its third battery HQ, 482 Bty, on 21 January 1941, while it was stationed at Tenby in Pembrokeshire, and its '7th Londons' subtitle was authorised on 17 February 1942. By May 1941, 47th (L) Division was back in the front line of anti-invasion defences, stationed in West Sussex under IV Corps. However, from December 1941, 47th (L) Division was no longer considered part of the field force and was placed on a lower establishment, though it remained in the static defences of the Hampshire and Dorset District. When 21st Army Group was formed in July 1943 to prepare for the Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord), 117th Fd Rgt was assigned to I Corps as a self-propelled field artillery regiment, but it does not seem to have served in this role and remained with 47th (L) Division.Order of Battle of the Forces in the United Kingdom, Part 2: 21 Army Group, 24 July 1943, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/238. After D-Day and the draining away of men and units to Normandy, 47th (L) Division was dispersed in August 1944. It was reformed as a reserve division with a training and draft finding role in September 1944, when 117th Field Rgt quickly rejoined. After 173rd Field Rgt was disbanded in January 1945, two of its batteries joined 117th as holding units: 138 Bty on 23 January and 156 Bty on 12 May. 117th (7th London) Field Regiment and all five batteries were placed in suspended animation on 23 March 1946.Frederick, p. 538. 56th Heavy RegimentHome Defence= 9.2-inch howitzer at Hastings, May 1940. 6-inch gun at Hastings, May 1940. 56th Heavy Regiment was formed at St Leonards-on-Sea, near Hastings, on 2 January 1940 from the cadre provided the previous month by 64th (7th London) Field Rgt. It was formed of four batteries, A, B, C and D, which were redesignated P, Q, R and S respectively on 11 March 1942.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex M. The regiment never received the '7th London' subtitle, but was included on the 7th Londons' regimental war memorial after WWII. In May 1940 it was photographed at Hastings manning 6-inch guns and 9.2-inch howitzers of World War I vintage. The 9.2-inch was an effective but relatively immobile siege gun. The regiment was serving in Eastern Command of Home Forces, and transferred to South-Eastern Command when that was split off in 1941.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery, 26 December 1940, TNA files WO 212/4 and WO 33/2365.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non- Divisional Units), 25 March 1941, TNA files WO 212/5 and WO 33/2323.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non- Divisional units), 22 October 1941, TNA files WO 212/6 and WO 33/1883.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non- Divisional units), 2 April 1942, TNA file WO 212/515.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 14 August 1942, with amendments, TNA files WO 212/7 and WO 33/1927. A 7.2-inch howitzer going into action; note the wooden ramps to absorb the recoil of the World-War I-era gun carriage. The 7.2-inch howitzer (a relined 8-inch howitzer from World War I) began to be issued to heavy regiments in 1942,Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, p. 389. and by then the regiment had its own signal section of the Royal Corps of Signals and Light Aid Detachment of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, ready for mobile warfare. In October 1942 the regiment was assigned to First Army preparing for the landings in North Africa (Operation Torch).Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 22 November 1942, TNA files WO 212/8 and WO 33/1962.Joslen, p. 465. On 1 January 1943 the four batteries were redesignated 15, 17, 18 and 19 Hvy Btys. =Tunisia= 56th Heavy Regiment landed in North Africa with 16 x 7.2-inch howitzers and reached the front line in Tunisia in mid-January 1943 – the first Royal Artillery regiment of heavy artillery to go overseas since Dunkirk. It formed part of 1st Army Group Royal Artillery (1st AGRA) a new kind of formation developed by the gunnery tacticians as powerful artillery brigades, usually comprising three medium regiments and one heavy regiment, which could be rapidly moved about the battlefield, and had the punch to destroy enemy artillery. The first AGRA HQs had been formed in August 1942 and officially sanctioned in November in time for Torch. 1st AGRA came into action in February 1943 on XIX French Corps' front.Frederick, p. 965.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, p. 273. 56th Heavy Rgt was with V British Corps to supported 78th Division's preparatory attacks in early April for the subsequent Battle of Longstop Hill.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, p. 396. =Italy= Scammell Pioneer tractor towing a 7.2-inch howitzer of 18 Bty, 56th Heavy Regiment, round a tight corner in 46th Division's sector, 23 December 1943. 56th Heavy Regiment served in 2nd AGRA during the Italian Campaign. For example, it was alongside 56th (L) Division's guns firing in support of 201st Guards Brigade's attack on 'Bare Arse Ridge' on 6 November during the Battle of Monte Camino.Joslen, p. 467. It supported 56th (L) Division again during the assault crossing of the Garigliano in January 1944.Molony, Vol V, p. 608. In February 1944, 2nd AGRA was sent without 56th Heavy Rgt to support the New Zealand Corps. Molony, Vol V, p. 697. By late May, 2nd AGRA, with 56th Heavy Rgt once more under command, was supporting X Corps' advance after Operation Diadem had broken through the German Winter Line, and the subsequent pursuit to Lake Trasimeno and advance to Florence. It continued with X Corps during Operation Olive to breach the Gothic Line.Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, pp. 247–8.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 1–5, 76, 225. =North West Europe= In early 1945 Operation Goldflake began to transfer selected British and Canadian forces from the Italian Front to reinforce 21st Army Group for its final offensive into Germany. 56th Heavy Rgt was one of the units transferred in an operation that involved a sea voyage to Marseilles and then an overland journey to Belgium. This was not completed until after the crossing of the Rhine in late March, and the units saw little action in the final stages of the campaign.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 161–3.Ellis, Germany, p. 213; Appendix IV.Joslen, p. 463. When the war in Europe ended on VE Day, 56th Heavy Rgt was in The Netherlands with 1st Canadian AGRA. By now it had adopted the new standard organisation of two batteries of 4 x 7.2-inch howitzers and two of 4 x 155mm guns (the US-made 'Long Tom'). On 7 May the regiment parked its guns at Arnhem aerodrome and returned its ammunition to the supply column. The personnel were then moved through liberated towns to Beverwijk in North Holland, where they established a concentration area for surrendered German troops and equipment. The regiment also took over the coastal defences from their German garrisons.56 Hvy Rgt at RA Netherlands.Ellis, Normandy, Appendix IV. The regiment served in British Army of the Rhine after the war ended, until it was disbanded between 16 and 27 March 1946. Postwar When the TA was reformed on 1 January 1947 the regiment was reconstituted at Fulham as 264 (7th London) Field Regiment; at the same time 117th Field Rgt was formally disbanded. The regiment served with 44th (Home Counties) Division.Frederick, pp. 997–8.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947. In 1961 the regiment was amalgamated with 290 (City of London) Field Rgt, 353 (London) Medium Rgt and 452 (London) Heavy Anti- Aircraft Rgt to form 254 (City of London) Field Regiment, to which the regiment contributed P (7th London) Bty at Fulham High Street. 254 (City of London) Rgt in turn was reduced into S (City of London) Bty in the Greater London Regiment, Royal Artillery, in the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve in 1967.Barnes, Appendix V.

It was dedicated to Pope Clement X and a 1671 edition was published in Amsterdam by Johannes van Waesbergen. The work was the first to discuss the topography, archeology and history of the Lazio region. It was based partly on Kircher's extensive walks in the countryside around Rome, although it included sites that he had probably not visited in person. The work included many illustrations of the contemporary countryside, as well as reconstructions of ancient buildings. It also included an account of his discovery of the ruined sanctuary at Mentorella, which he had already recounted in his 1665 work Historia Eustachio Mariana. Contents Machinery for draining the Pontine Marshes in Athanasius Kircher's \\"Latium\\" Kircher’s stated purpose in Latium was to use the physical remains of ancient Latium as illustrations of human mutability and transience. It was divided into five books. The first covered the origins and ancient history of the Latins. The second contained chapters describing (I) the region of Monte Cavo, Lake Albano and the ancient town of Alba Longa; (II) Tusculum; (III) the ancient Praeneste and the modern town of Palestrina, and (IV) the region of Labici and the ancient Hernici tribe.The third book examined the ancient history of Tivoli and the fourth, the countryside and ancient remains around it. The fifth book was devoted to the Pontine marshes. The Pontine Marshes to the southeast of Rome had been discussed by Kircher in his 1658 work Scrutinium Physico-Medicum because they were a source of malaria that prevented the agricultural development of the neighbouring region and imposed a heavy burden of disease on its population. Kircher was probably one of the first people to recommend the taking of quinine in Rome to counter malaria. Pope Urban VIII had brought in the Dutch engineer De Wit to begin draining the marshes and in Latium Kircher noted these efforts approvingly, illustrating the devices used to pump out the water. Ancient history of Latium Pages from ‘Latium’ by Athanasius Kircher (1671) In Book I, Kircher advanced the theory that Latium had been populated after the time of the Tower of Babel, or possibly before. Indeed he held that it had originally been settled by Noah, and that this was supported by local legends about Saturn and Janus, whom he believed were in fact Noah himself. Thus, he held, the mythological account of the castration of Saturn was a variant of the Biblical story of the discovery of Noah's nakedness by Ham. Such speculative theories were to be developed in his later works Turris Babel and Arca Noë. During his countryside walks, Kircher was searching for evidence that would allow him to reconstruct the history of the region from its earliest times right up to the pontificate of Pope Alexander VII. Although the timeline he constructed was highly inaccurate, the evidence he gathered was the first attempt at a complete chronological reconstruction of the region’s history. The Nile mosaic Illustration of the 'Nile mosaic' from Kircher's 'Latium' Around 1600 a Roman mosaic was discovered at the Temple of Fortuna Primigenia at Praeneste. It is known to modern scholarship as \\"the Nile mosaic\\" because it is understood to represent the course of the River Nile from the mountains of Ethiopia through Sudan and Egypt to the sea. However in Book III of Latium Kircher offered a completely different interpretation of the piece, based on the idea that it depicted ceremonies in honour of the goddess of fortune. The upper part, he said, depicted wild animals, representing fortune's dangers. He noted that the people of ancient Praeneste were devotees of Hercules, who was famous for having destroyed monsters and overcome ill fortune. Beneath this, he said, was depicted the veneration of the goddess and consultation of her oracle. He correctly identified the temple of Serapis but this did not serve as a clue of the mosaic's real subject. At the bottom there are festivals and processions in honour of the goddess. Illustrations Frontispiece of “Latium” by Athanasius Kircher Illustration of the Temple of Vesta, Tivoli from ‘Latium’ by Athanasius Kircher (1671) Latium was published in folio with 27 engraved plates. These included illustrations, maps, and plans, including 15 double- page foldouts. The illustrations included views of the countryside, sculptures, mosaics, coins and mechanical devices such as watermills. The frontispiece was by Romeyn de Hooghe. It depicted a seated figure of the genius loci Latia. One one side of her stands a mountain on which Atlas hold up the world, and on the other figures a volcano. These emblems represent, perhaps, the temporal and spiritual power of Rome respectively. Above her hang both ancient and contemporary arms. Romulus and Remus and their she-wolf adopted mother play behind her back while a putto presents her with the papal tiara and the keys of Saint Peter. She is wearing regalia that show that her presence and her power are intimately connected with the Catholic Church. Her crown identifies her as the protector of a city, and the star above it is the symbols of the Chigi family to which Pope Alexander VII belonged. She holds a long sceptre topped with the hand of justice and her eyes fall on a mitre, a cardinal's hat, and other Catholic religious objects. Her robe covers the imperial eagle and her foot rests on the orb of temporal power, indicating her primacy over the Holy Roman Emperor. Beneath Latia is inscribed the Latin motto 'Latium cui par nihil est, nihil Secundu' ('Latium, to which none is equal, and second to none'). At the bottom of the illustration the male figures are the gods of the river Tiber and its Tivoli tributary the Aniene. The female figure with butterfly wings is the goddess of the Aniene, otherwise Ino, resting on symbols of her mythological shipwreck. The imagery of the frontispiece was intended to emphasise the purpose of Kircher’s claim that his contemporary Rome was connected not just to the ancient city that preceded it, but to a both the ancient classical and biblical worlds. The figure of Latia was Etruscan, the sceptre she hold resembled the regalia of ancient Egypt, while Greece was represented by the winged figure of Ino. The illustration depicting the apotheosis of Homer was signed by Giovanni Battista Galestruzzi. The aerial view of Palestrina and the plate of the Nile mosaic were signed by Agapito de Bernardini. The maps in the book were the work of Innocenzo Mattei. The book also reused a number of earlier illustrations from previously published works, by Étienne Dupérac, Daniele Stoopendahl and Matteo Greuter. The image of the reconstruction of Hadrian’s villa was a replica of the illustration by Francesco Contini and the image of the temple of Fortune was a replica of a piece by Domenico Castelli. Critical reception The work was criticised by many scholars of Kircher’s time for its inaccuracies and speculations about ancient history. Raffaello Fabretti pointed out that Kircher’s text was full of mistakes, his images of aqueducts were inaccurate and his map wrongly located the source of the Aqua Virgo near Colonna. Kircher intended to write a similar work on Etruria, entitled Iter Etruscum, but this was never published, because the Jesuit censors would not approve it. Further reading * Harry B. Evans (2012).

He is particularly noted for his study of the Lithuanian language. He held the Chair of Baltic Philology in the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań and was the founder of the Lingua Posnaniensis journal. His three-volume work Gramatyka języka litewskiego (Grammar of Contemporary Lithuanian) is considered his magnum opus.  Early life  Otrębski was born on 8 December 1889, to a family of intellectuals in Pilica, Silesian Voivodeship. He studied at the University of Warsaw, where he met Yefemiy Karski who was the supervisor of his first thesis, \\"Description of Byelorussian Dialects in Vilnius Province\\". During his work on this thesis he first came into contact with the Lithuanian language. The work received a gold medal, and Otrębski was titled \\"Primus Inter Pares\\". In 1914 he studied for his doctorate at Leipzig University, and managed to complete his doctoral dissertation in comparative linguistics by early 1915. However, the outbreak of World War I prevented him from completing his education. He was interned, and worked for a time in a German brick factory. Later during the war he moved to Kalisz, where he worked as a teacher. When the war ended, Otrębski submitted his doctoral thesis, titled \\"Przyczynki do gramatyki porównawczej języków indoeuropejskich\\" (\\"Contributions to a Comparative Grammar of the Indo-European Languages\\"), to Professor Jan Michał Rozwadowski at Jagiellonian University, and he defended the dissertation in 1920. Career After receiving his doctorate, Otrębski became associated with the Polish Stefan Batory University (today Vilnius University), becoming a professor and heading the Department of Indo-European Studies. He studied the Lithuanian dialect in Tverečius between 1928 and 1934. During World War II he was at Vilnius University. After the war he moved to Poznań, founding in 1947 the Chair of Baltic Philology at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań. Otrębski authored 350 scientific papers in the field of Slavic and Baltic studies, of which more than 100 were devoted to the study of the Lithuanian language. He founded the Lingua Posnaniensis journal, published by the Poznań Society of Friends of Learning. His three-volume work titled Gramatyka języka litewskiego (Grammar of Contemporary Lithuanian) is considered his magnum opus. Death and legacy Otrębski died on 26 April 1971 in Poznań, where he was buried. Though Otrębski had been born in Pilica in southern Poland, which had nothing in common with Lithuania, and his first contact with Lithuanian was as an adult, he devoted much of his adult life to the study of the Lithuanian language. In Lithuania, he is respected alongside other Poles who contributed to Lithuanian culture, such as Adam Mickiewicz, Czesław Miłosz, and Jerzy Giedroyc. In 2014, on the 125th anniversary of his birth, his memory was honored in a scientific conference held in the Seimas (Lithuanian parliament).

Ian Willmore (5 November 1958 – 7 April 2020), self-styled ‘professional trouble-maker’, played a leading role in defending the independence of the civil service in the1980s and campaigning for legislation to ban smoking in public places and standardised packaging of tobacco products.  Biography  Willmore was born in Cardiff on November 5, 1958 to parents Oliver Willmore (architect) and Anne (nee Burnell). He died following a heart attack on April 7 2020.  Career  After Marlborough College, he studied Philosophy and Theology at Oriel College, Oxford before joining the Civil Service as an administrative trainee at the Department of Employment. In December 1983 he leaked a memorandum to Time Out which included information about advice the Master of the Rolls, Sir John Donaldson, had given advice to Michael Quinlan, the Permanent Secretary in the Department of Employment, on the future of the law relating to industrial relations. He took this action because he believed this was cynical government interference in the traditional independence of Civil Service departments amounting to constitutional subversion, which he believed should be made public. The leak was widely covered by the media and, having admitted his part and resigned, Willmore explained his motivation on Granada TV’s World in Action. The Attorney-General, Sir Michael Havers QC, decided against prosecuting Willmore, saying that Section 2 should be used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary. The case has been recognised as one of the most notable 20th century cases involving official secrets legislation or leaks of government information. Willmore then campaigned on youth unemployment for YouthAid, before working for the Transport and General Workers Union from 1985-91. He wrote General Secretary Ron Todd’s controversial speech to the Tribune rally at the 1988 Labour Party conference, which with its finger- pointing at ‘Filofax-wielding modernisers’ grabbed front-page headlines. A long-standing member of the Labour Party, Willmore was a Haringey Councillor for South Tottenham Ward between 1988 and 1997, and held positions including Deputy Leader and Chair of Finance. He stood for parliament twice as a Labour candidate, in South West Hertfordshire in 1987 and in Braintree in 1992. He worked for Labour MP and shadow cabinet minister Michael Meacher from 1994-97 and then as head of Friends of the Earth’s press office from 1997 to 2003, where he turned his colleagues’ academic research into press releases that would gain tabloid coverage.  Smoke-free campaigning  He joined Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) in 2003 as Media and Campaigns Manager, where he played an important role in the campaign for smoke-free laws to include pubs and clubs, won on a free vote in parliament in 2006 and implemented in England in 2007. The legislation led to a significant reduction in heart attacks (MI) resulting in 1,200 fewer emergency admissions for MI in the year following the introduction of smokefree legislation. There was also a significant increase in the number of people making an attempt to give up smoking at the time the legislation was implemented (July and August 2007), equivalent to 300,000 smokers in England trying to quit. A study of bar workers in England showed that their exposure to second-hand smoke reduced on average between 73% and 91% and measures of their respiratory health significantly improved after the introduction of the legislation. UK public health experts voted it the greatest UK public health achievement of the 21st century. Willmore returned to work for ASH on a part-time consultancy basis and played a key role in the campaign for legislation to require standardised cigarette packaging. Having consulted on standardised packaging, David Cameron’s government had decided not to proceed[], until a group of cross-party backbench peers tabled an amendment requiring standardised packaging to the Children and Families Bill going through parliament in 2013. Like the smokefree laws, the legislation was achieved, with Willmore's help, on a free vote in parliament. When the tobacco manufacturers took forward a judicial review challenging the legislation, ASH acted as an intervener in support of the Government. The lawyers Sean Humber at solicitors Leigh Day, who instructed barristers Peter Oliver and Ligia Osepciu from Monckton Chambers, acted pro bono for ASH. Willmore drafted the detailed brief for the lawyers and attended every day of the court case. The judgement found overwhelmingly against the tobacco manufacturers and the legislation was implemented in 2017.  Projects and Interests  Willmore had many and eclectic interests alongside politics and was a talented jazz pianist and chess player.  Publications  He wrote many articles for the national and political press. Most notable were his accounts of the Climbie affair and the subsequent inquiry, and what he saw as the establishment’s search for scapegoats, ‘An evasion of responsibility’ and ‘Passing the Buck’. During his time as Media Coordinator of Friends of the Earth Willmore wrote a monthly column on environmental issues for the Observer website. He was co-author of articles analysing how the campaign for smokefree legislation in England achieved success.

Eighteenth century The first paper to use the title Nottingham Mercury was launched on 1 January 1714 by John Collyer and printed at the Hen Cross. Originally called The New Mercury it was quickly renamed the Nottingham Mercury. It was published to offer an alternative view to that in William Ayscough’s Weekly Courant but it only lasted a few years before ceasing publication around 1727. Nineteenth century The second paper to use the title started in 1825 when Jonathan Dunn published the Nottingham Mercury from his offices on South Parade in Nottingham under its proprietor Thomas Wakefield. It struggled to gain readership so was renamed the Nottingham and Newark Mercury. From 1827 to 1838 Matthew Henry Barker was the editor. The paper was intended to promote the Whig party values of the Nottingham Corporation as the Nottingham Journal was the representative and exponent of the Tory, Church and King party and the Nottingham Review was the advocate of Liberal principles. In 1834, Samuel Bennett succeeded Jonathan Dunn as publisher, but he died two years later in 1836 and was succeeded by Richard Allen when it changed its name to the Nottingham Mercury. In 1838 its sale was a little over 1,000 per week. In 1847 Thomas Bailey became the sole proprietor and production was transferred to Mr Forman of the Nottingham Guardian which reduced the cost and improved the quality. However, Thomas Bailey’s opinions were considered too temperate by his readers. The circulation of the paper declined. In 1850 the Nottingham Mercury had an average weekly run of 625, whereas the Nottingham Review had 1,634 and the Nottingham Journal 2,269. In 1851 the mass of subscribers withdrew in protest at Bailey's views respecting the original error of the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, and his prophecies of its inevitable failure. In the following year the journal declared bankrupt.

Wick Court is a Grade II* listed building. History and description The Pevsner Architectural Guide, Gloucestershire: The Vale And The Forest of Dean suggests that the earliest part of the court, the south front, dates from the late 14th century. The house was remodelled and enlarged in the mid-17th century, probably for a Thomas Yate. The site is moated and Historic England records that the court was used as a fishing lodge used by the Lords Berkeley and may have been visited by Elizabeth I. In the 20th century, the court was purchased by the charity, Farms for City Children founded by Clare Morpurgo and her husband, the author Michael Morpurgo. Wick operates as a small-scale traditional livestock farm. Pevsner describes the north front of the house as the \\"show\\" front. It is of five bays and three storeys, with a two-storey porch. The top floor of the house was planned as a long gallery, a common Elizabethan feature, but this was never completed.

He was the founding principal and president of Southern Seminary Junior College in Buena Vista, Virginia. Early life  Durham was born in Shelby, Cleveland County, North Carolina on May 4, 1870. His mother was Catherine Durham and his father was Plato Durham, a well-known attorney of his time. His father died five years after his birth. In 1877, his mother remarried to Benjamin Franklin Dixon, a physician, and after the marriage, Durham's family later resided in Oxford where Durham studied at Horner Military School. In 1891 he graduated with a degree in civil engineering from Trinity College of Randolph County, which was later known as Duke University. Durham later worried that the increasing financial instability was serious enough to hinder a career in engineering, after which he studied law at Trinity College. Career In 1892 he enrolled in a private graduate school in Greensboro, North Carolina, and passed the North Carolina Bar Exam by the next year. By 1893, Durham started to specialize in legal matters in Rutherfordton. Durham started taking an interest in politics, after which he served as a delegate to the North Carolina Democratic Committee for four years from 1894 to 1898 and on the stage panel during the 1906 Democratic State Convention. In 1898 he assembled his own company, in Gastonia, of the North Carolina Infantry when the Spanish–American War broke out; however, he was not asked to serve in the war. Durham thought that the idea of holding the office of State Senator was attractive, but he could not find agreement with his party over every issue. Durham found agreement with his party about the issues concerning race, taxation, and other policies, but disagreement over gold caused Durham to decline the office of State Senator. According to Durham, gold should be the standard of the country's currency and he aimed to vote to guarantee its use. Durham declined to have his name on the ballot in an attempt to protect his political allies. In 1908, Durham wrote a book named The Call of the South, which was based on a novel about miscegenation. In his book, he wrote about the amalgamation of white people and African Americans and warned against racial mixing, claiming that it threatened the downfall of the country. One review from the Associated Press called it \\"one of the most interesting books I have ever had the pleasure to read\\". L.C. Page and Company stopped publishing the book by 1911. For three years, sales gradually diminished until the publisher stopped the printing and Durham bought the rights of the book from the publisher. In 1909 he ended his law practice and went to teaching, firstly at Davenport Female College in Lenoir, North Carolina, where he was dean and taught mathematics, and then at Centenary College-Conservatory located in Cleveland, Tennessee. By 1911 he worked as a dean of faculty and taught mathematics at Martha Washington College (which later merged with Emory and Henry College) and shifted to Abingdon, Virginia. In 1919 Durham bought a half-interest in a girl's school called Southern Seminary in Buena Vista, Virginia. He became its principal and three years later bought the other half-interest from the co-founder of the school, Edgar Healy Rowe. During his tenure, first as principal and later as president, Durham aimed to strengthen the school's academic program and develop the mental, social, physical, and spiritual lives of students. He broadened the school's curriculum to cover college-level courses, and in 1926 the school started to offer a junior college diploma. Durham expanded the facilities of the school to include a gymnasium, modern classroom infrastructure which was now having chemistry and laboratories, and Chandler Hall with a library and an auditorium. In 1922, Durham's daughter, Margaret, married H. Russell Robey, who later purchased Rowe's remaining interest in the school and became the business manager and treasurer of the school. College-level courses were added to the curriculum, and the first class of the new junior college program graduated in 1925. The school later came to be called Southern Seminary and Junior College. Durham was a Democrat until he saw Franklin D. Roosevelt supporting the end of Prohibition. This led Durham to switch his support to Republican candidate Herbert Hoover, who would become president of the US in 1929. In 1932, Durham campaigned against Roosevelt in favor of Hoover, and called himself a \\"dry Democrat\\" who was \\"betraying\\" the Democratic Party \\"for a higher moral cause\\". Durham was baffled how he could be at odds with his own party. In an attempt to understand his own mind, he wrote a novel Silhouette, which attempted to understand a Southern man having lived through 1920s and into the 1930s. Durham was an active member of the Methodist Church. In 1942 he retired from his position as the president of Southern Seminary and Junior College and his own daughter, Margaret Durham Robey, succeeded him as president of the college.

She worked on many projects but she is known for leading a team working on the Thames Barrier. She broke a 200 year long list of Admirals who looked after keeping the River Mersey navigable when she appointed Acting Conservator of the River Mersey - a role that dates back to 1625.  Life  Kendrick was born in Nottingham in 1928. Her parents were Dorothy Ellen and Charles Manley Boak. Her father was a haulage contractor and they lived at 19 Curzon Street in Nottingham. In 1951 she graduated with a double first from Cambridge University in English and Geography. Her first job was at the UK government's Hydraulics Research Station (HRC) at Wallingford. She modestly applied for a job as a secretary and it was the interviewer who decided she should be an Assistant Experimental Officer. Her first task was to study the increasing silt building up in the River Mersey. In 1964 she was the only female senior manager at the Hydraulic Research Station where she had a team of ten people (all men). That year she won the Telford Medal given annually by the Institution of Civil Engineers for the paper ‘Field and model investigations into the reasons for siltation in the Mersey estuary’, co-authored in 1963 with her colleague (William) Alan Price and published in the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers. She was the first woman to be given this honour. In 1968 hydraulic studies were funded to understand how a barrier across the River Thames would affect the levels of the river and change the movement of silt, although at that time no particular site had been chosen. Kendrick was asked to lead the project. This would lead to the creation of stations to monitor the measure and the studies were not complete until 1981. During the 1980s the HRC won a contract to do work to support a Mersey barrage. Kendrick was asked to lead this work. She retired in 1988 but the work did not end. For two hundred years Admirals would be appointed to the position of the Acting Conservator of the River Mersey. Kendrick was to break this run when she became the acting conservator in 1988. It was her responsibility to keep the Mersey navigable for the port of Liverpool. She held that job for ten years. In 1983 she gave the Verena Holmes Lecture of the Women's Engineering Society concerning her work. (She repeated the talk in Madrid at the International Symposium on El Paisaje del Agua in 1986). Kendrick died in Henley-on-Thames in 2015.  Private life  Kendrick married Les Kendrick in 1951.

Development The VTO originally comprised the following transport companies: *Halberstädter Bus- Betriebe GmbH (HBB) *Q-Bus Nahverkehrsgesellschaft mbH (Q-Bus) *Wernigeröder Public Transport Company GmbH (WVB) *Halberstädter Verkehrs-GmbH (HVG) After the district area reform in 2007, WVB, HBB and Q-Bus were merged to form the Harzer Verkehrsbetriebe GmbH (HVB), so that currently (as of 2013) the following companies are united in the VTO: *Harzer Verkehrsbetriebe GmbH (HVB) *Halberstädter Verkehrs-GmbH (HVG) *DB Regio AG (recognition of certain tickets) *Harz-Elbe-Express (recognition of certain tickets) *Harzer Schmalspurbahnen (HSB) (recognition of certain tickets) Area Tariff area of the VTO (as of 2015) The core area of the VTO is the present Harz district. However, due to the intercity lines, the tickets are also valid beyond this area. Bad Harzburg, Braunlage (both Lower Saxony), Aschersleben (Salzlandkreis), Hettstedt, Wippra (both Mansfeld-Südharz) and Oschersleben (Bode) (Börde district) also have their own tariff zone within the VTO. Tariff structure The aim was to ensure that tickets were mutually recognised within the three districts and to establish a uniform price board. The price board was revised and the following cards were introduced: the 10-ticket card (since 2011 also the 4-ticket card), a transferable weekly and monthly ticket, a weekly and monthly trainee ticket and, exclusively for the city transport of Blankenburg and Wernigerode, the 9 o'clock ticket (9-Uhr- Karte), the family day ticket and the city card. On 1 May 2008, the social ticket was also introduced so that Hartz IV recipients are entitled to buy tickets at a reduced rate (\\"children's rate\\"). For the HVG area, VTO tickets are only valid for season tickets that include the Halberstadt tariff zone; in all other cases, a separate ticket must be purchased for the HVG tram. The following tickets are offered: *9-Uhr-Karte is valid for one month on the city transport system of Wernigerode and Blankenburg and is valid for any number of journeys. *Familien-Tageskarte is valid for two adults and two children (up to 11 years, since 2011 up to 14 years) only in the city transport system of Blankenburg and Wernigerode. *CityCard is valid from the beginning for one year and entitles to use the city transport system of Blankenburg and Wernigerode. *HarzTourCard is valid on three consecutive days in all participating companies. *HarzMobilCard is an additional card which entitles you to travel with the reduced ticket (\\"children's fare\\") for one month. Included are the HSB (except Brocken), the trams in Halberstadt and selected trains of DB Regio and HEX. *Selkebahnticket allows the use of selected bus lines of the HVB and the Selketalbahn and is valid for 3 days. *WiSel-Card is valid on selected train and bus lines in the direction of Mansfeld Land, only on weekends and public holidays for one calendar day.

It is endemic to Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, where it is known from a small number of locations, including the eponymous Mount Saribau. It has often been included in Alcalus baluensis (=Ingerana baluensis), but is now considered a distinct species. The two species are similar but Alcalus sariba is larger. Description The holotype is a female measuring in snout–vent length, and the common length for females is ; the size of the male is unknown. The overall appearance is stocky. The head is relatively big compared to the body. Coloration varies from light to dark brown and includes some darker markings. The adhesive finger discs bear a white cross-bar. Habitat and conservation Alcalus sariba occurs along seepage areas close to small streams as well as in leaf litter in primary forest; it does not tolerate habitat disturbance. Breeding biology is unknown but presumably involves direct development (i.e, there is no free-living larval stage), as in other Alcalus. Alcalus sariba is considered common and occurs in the Santubong National Park, Kubah National Park, and Matang Wildlife Centre. However, outside protected areas it is threatened by habitat loss caused by logging concessions, small scale subsistence logging, and oil palm plantations. Furthermore, Santubong National Park is facing encroachment from housing and tourism development.

Early life Strozier was born in Birmingham, Alabama, but moved to Chicago, with her mother, when she was a toddler. Strozier's mother was a drug addict, who was not able to care for her properly, and her grandmother raised her from age 6. She was diagnosed with a learning disability at age 8 that profoundly affected both reading and math. According to The Chicago Tribune \\"when she read aloud, it was in such a halting manner that it sometimes sounded like she was gasping for breath.\\" Her grandmother recounted being advised that Lynika's disability was so profound that she should take steps to have her placed on social assistance for the rest of her life—advice she rejected, having confidence that Lynika could overcome her difficulties, with sufficient effort and support. Academic career Strozier finished high school, and went to study at the University of Northern Iowa on a scholarship. But she did poorly, and returned to Chicago. She then enrolled at Truman College, where a mentor, Yvonne Harris, encouraged her to consider science, in spite of her disabilities. Her teachers describe her overcoming her disabilities through a combination of hard work, and creative alternatives. For instance, she did all her calculations, longhand, on paper, rather than use a calculator, because it helped her continue to visualize the meaning of the numbers. Harris described talking with her about how she was a visual thinker, and so she encouraged her to first draw pictures and diagrams of the information she wanted to present, and then use those drawings as an outline for her written presentations. When she started to work at Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History, as a student intern, she found she had a gift for lab work. One of her superiors described her as having \\"golden hands\\", being able to coax DNA from particularly small and difficult biological samples. She earned an associate degree from Turner, and, while working at the Field Museum, finished a Bachelor of Science at Dominican University, and went on to earn master's degrees at Loyola University Chicago and University of Illinois, Chicago. She spent most of her scientific career at the Field Museum. In addition to her work at the Field Museum she was one of two scientists at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago's science lab. In 2018 she finished two master's degrees, and in 2019 she started working as an adjunct professor at Malcolm X College—which colleagues describe as her dream job. In March 2020, the Gantz Family Collections Center at the Field Museum awarded Strozier the honorary role of Collections Associate. Death and legacy Strozier died due to COVID-19 in June 2020.

The work was commissioned by the Klangforum Wien, written in 2011, and premiered on 14 November 2011 in the Terazije Theatre, Belgrade, during the International Composers' Festival held that year. The conductor for the premiere was Clement Power conducting the Klangforum Wien. The piece has received the world's largest prize for musical composition the Grawemeyer Award in 2014. Since its premiere, despite the complexity of the work, the piece was performed around the world more than 40 times. The music is composed during July–October 2011, partly in Gagnef and in Stockholm. The approximate duration of the piece is 20 minutes.  Instrumentation  The composition is scored for 1 flute, 1 oboe, 1 clarinet, 1 bassoon, 1 horn, 1 trumpet piccolo, 1 trombone, 1 percussion, 1 piano, 2 violins, 1 viola, 1 cello and 1 contrabass. The piece has numerous doublings including human whistle and voices.  The Grawemeyer Award  The composition has received the Grawemeyer Award for musical composition in year 2014, with the sum of US$100.000. The 20-minute work “makes a huge emotional journey in a relatively short period of time, moving through many landscapes between the mysterious, moody opening and the ecstatic conclusion. The composer also makes wonderful use of the colors of the 14-piece ensemble. The instruments are used in fascinating ways, both traditional and otherwise … that shape the sound of unnatural, echoing beauty,” said award director Marc Satterwhite.  Djuro Zivkovic on \\"On the Guarding of the Heart\\"  \\"The main theme of “On the Guarding of the Heart” is the need to return into oneself, to descent with the intellect in to the depths of the heart, to guard it and to seek there the hidden treasure of the inner kingdom. The music is very stimulated by reading of the Philokalia; it is about a hard-achieved detachment, stillness and watchfulness, it is about solitude and exile\\" Zivkovic explains further the begging of the music in his document \\"How to perform On the Guarding of the Heart\\" with the following statements: \\"The piece starts in a kind of sound genesis, which can be also a universal genesis, beginning of matter, or birth of life, a summation of time. (…) VIOLIN 1+2 and VIOLA have a genetic birth; or thousands of genomes and thoughts that flow in a deep prayer. (…) The PIANO enters with a self- sacrificing idea, it represents awakening from the dreamy world. It sums up all your mind, and makes every thing into one and clear. Piano plays strongly, without trying to land in the dreamy world of other instruments. Its playing is like a moment of discovery of a scientists. It is the intellectual sum of the mind in a prayer.\\" Furthermore, the last measure of the composition he explains as following: \\"It is attempt to condensate everything in mind and soul, it is understanding of the totality, it is putting all things at their proper place in the universe. It is order of the faith. It is a state exempt from the evil. (…) The sound must melt walls in the hall, the audience should stop breathing, and every single atom and particles of time should condense in ‘the true unfading light, in the eternal life, in hidden mystery, in everlasting exultation, in ineffable reality, and will come close to the incomprehensible face’.\\"  Recordings  * LAWO Classics released the CD \\"Xtended Hearts and Unheard Herds\\" in 2019.

In other words, a particular eclipse will be repeated only if the Moon will complete roughly an integer number of synodic, draconic, and anomalistic periods (223, 242, and 239) and the Earth-Sun-Moon geometry will be nearly identical to that eclipse. The Moon will be at the same node and the same distance from the Earth. Gamma changes monotonically throughout any single Saros series. The change in gamma is larger when Earth is near its aphelion (June to July) than when it is near perihelion (December to January). When the Earth is near its average distance (March to April or September to October), the change in gamma is average. The first three conditions can be met after a time equal to the integral multiple of synodic, draconic, and anomalistic periods. The period is approximately equal to 6,585.32 days (18 years 11 days 8 hours). Eclipses would not occur in every month If the Earth had a perfectly circular orbit centered around the Sun, and the Moon's orbit was also perfectly circular and centered around the Earth, and both orbits were coplanar (on the same plane) with each other, then two eclipses would happen every lunar month (29.53 days). A lunar eclipse would occur at every full moon, a solar eclipse every new moon, and all solar eclipses would be the same type. In fact the distances between the Earth and Moon and that of the Earth and the Sun vary because both the Earth and the Moon have elliptic orbits. Also, both the orbits are not on the same plane. The Moon's orbit is inclined about 5.14° to Earth's orbit around the Sun. So the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic at two points or nodes. If a New Moon takes place within about 17° of a node, then a solar eclipse will be visible from some location on Earth.Periodicity of Lunar and Solar Eclipses, Fred EspenakFive Millennium Catalog of Lunar and Solar Eclipses: -1999 to +3000, Fred Espenak and Jean Meeus At an average angular velocity of 0.99° per day, the Sun takes 34.5 days to cross the 34° wide eclipse zone centered on each node. Because the Moon's orbit with respect to the Sun has a mean duration of 29.53 days, there will always be one and possibly two solar eclipses during each 34.5-day interval when the Sun passes through the nodal eclipse zones. These time periods are called eclipse seasons. Either two or three eclipses happen each eclipse season. During the eclipse season, the inclination of the Moon's orbit is low, hence the Sun, Moon, and Earth become aligned straight enough (in syzygy) for an eclipse to occur.

His background was highly influenced by late 19th century Positivism, so this influence is denoted in his works. He was also a Hispanist, defender of the historical and cultural legacy of Spain in Spanish America and critic of the American Interventionism policy in Latin America.  Lawyer and columnist  He was the son of Miguel Pereyra Bosque and María de Jesús Gómez Méndez. As a lawyer, he was an ex officio defender in Mexico City, agent of public ministry and member of the state treasury commission of Coahuila. He directed the newspaper El Espectador in the city of Monterrey, collaborated in the newspaper El Norte of Chihuahua, as well as in the Positive Revista magazine, El Imparcial 'and El Mundo Ilustrado in Mexico City. Due to his positivist ideology he collaborated with Justo Sierra, but he was ideologically contrary to Francisco Bulnes. Kozel, Andrés Op.cit. P.5  Teaching, diplomat and thinker  He taught at the National Preparatory School and at the National School of Jurisprudence of the University of Mexico; he was deputy and Secretary of the Mexican Embassy in Washington, in charge of business in Cuba, plenipotentiary minister in Belgium and the Netherlands; He was a member of International Court of Arbitration of The Hague in 1913. As a plenipotentiary minister of Mexico, he participated as a delegate of the Mexican Government, in the First Congress of the International Judicial Police, the first antecedent of what is now the International Organization of the Criminal Police, Interpol, held in Montecarlo, Monaco, 14–18 April 1614.Journal of Monaco, 5 May 1914 He made an analysis of the relations between the United States and Mexico, he criticized the ideology of American expansionism, which he considered cynical and unfair, reflected his criticisms in the books devoted to the analysis of the Monroe Doctrine.Kozel, Andrés Op.cit. p.14-21 Together with the Argentine Manuel Ugarte and other Latin American thinkers, he spoke up against the growing influence of the United States in Latin America.Arenal Fenochio, Jaime del Op.cit. p.36 Without considering himself an anti-liberal, he did not agree with the ideas of the Mexican Revolution, and criticized the revolutionary leaders Francisco I. Madero, Pancho Villa, Venustiano Carranza, and Plutarco Elías Calles. Arenal Fenochio, Jaime del Op.cit. P.33  Writer and historian  As historian, he started with his home state when he wrote Historia de Coahuila, far from pronouncing himself as an indigenist or regionalist, the work aims to lean towards a Hispanist and Americanist style. The feats of Fernando de Magallanes, Juan Sebastián Elcano, Francisco Vázquez de Coronado and Pánfilo de Narváez are indirectly described; however, Pereyra criticized the actions of Nuño de Guzmán and highlighted the extermination of the indigenous population of Coahuila, which was, in comparison to other regions, a particular situation in the northeast of Mexico, which is attributed not only to the Spanish colonizers, but also to the permanent state of war between different indigenous groups, sparsely population, displacement and diseases. Pereyra, Carlos Op.cit. Biographical notes by Martín Quirarte In 1916 he settled in Spain, despite not applying for nationality, he considered this country of residence as his new homeland; He met the Venezuelan Rufino Blanco Fombona and collaborated for the Editorial América. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, there was a strong anti-Spanish sentiment, mainly as result of the Spanish Black Legend, as the investigations of English- speaking historians such as Scots William Robertson, and the American William H. Prescott had caused a great impact of a negative nature towards the actions of the Spanish conquerors. Authors such as the English economist William Cunningham or the French historian Charles Seignobos severely judged the period of domination of Spanish Empire. Pereyra set the goal of reinvigorating everything Latin American and Iberian, so he was given the task of reviewing the history of Spain's work in America, becoming a recognized Hispanist, to the point that it was said that \\"He was a Hispanist more Hispanist than the Spaniards themselves\\". He specialized in maritime explorations, in the foundations in America and in Latin American social life, making comparisons with the English civilization in North America. In his work he expressed his great admiration for Vasco de Gama and Vasco Núñez de Balboa. He defended the work of Bernal Díaz del Castillo from the criticisms of Robertson and Prescott. He knew how to value the different historical factors according to the time in question. The economic, political and ideological causes did not always intervene with equal intensity. Each historical time offers its peculiar dimension that must be studied without prejudices elaborated beforehand. Pereyra maintained a constant openness towards all those people who approached with the noble desire to learn. Among his students, was Vicente Rodríguez Casado, founder of the School of Hispanic-American Studies (Seville) and the Hispano-American University of Santa María de La Rábida (Huelva). In addition, he pronounced himself in favor of Paraguay in the maximum war between Latin American nations, the Triple Alliance War and wrote several works in this regard.  Academic and awards  He was elected a notable corresponding member of the Mexican Academy of Language. He was a member of the Mexican Academy of History, occupied the seat 23, from 1933 to 1942. By 1934, by way of recognition, the Spanish government granted him a position in the Institute «Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés», where he worked with the Salvadoran Rodolfo Barón Castro; He made several publications in the \\"Magazine of the Indies.\\" He died on 29 June 1942, his widow gave the writer's personal library to the Institute.

The Kursky suburban railway line connects Moscow with the stations in the south, in particular, with the towns of Podolsk, Chekhov, Serpukhov, Yasnogorsk, and Tula. The stations the line serves are located in Moscow, as well as in Podolsk, Chekhov, and Serpukhov in Moscow Oblast, as well as in Zaoksky and Yasnogorsky Districts and the city of Tula in Tula Oblast. Some of the suburban trains have their northern terminus at Moscow Kursky railway station in Moscow, others commute from the Rizhsky suburban railway line. In the southern direction, the suburban trains terminate at Krasny Stroitel, Shcherbinka, Podolsk, Lvovskaya, Chekhov, Serpukhov, and Tula I. The line is operated by Moscow Railway. The tracks between Moscow Kursky railway station and Podolsk are also used by Line D2, one of the Moscow Central Diameters. The suburban railway line follows the railway which connects Moscow with Kursk and Belgorod and further with Kharkiv. It is electrified and has two tracks everywhere between Moscow and the Ukrainian border. The distance between Kursky railway station and Tula I is . History The railway connecting Moscow and Serpukhov was opened in 1866 for passenger traffic and in 1867 for cargo traffic. In 1867, it was extended to Tula and eventually to Kursk, and was first known as Moscow — Kursk railway. The section between Moscow and Tsaritsyno was electrified in 1938, and the electrification was extended to Podolsk in 1939. It was further extended to Lvovskaya in 1947, Serpukhov in 1953, and Tula and further to Skuratovo in 1957. On 21 November 2019 Moscow Central Diameters started operation.

In the modern German Catholic hymnal Gotteslob, it appears as GL 465. The hymn initially focuses on observing nature and then compares its transience to that of human life.  History and text  The text was written in 1978 by , born on 15 May 1934 in Hanover, who was a retired Protestant pastor and honorary professor, writer, poet and hymnwriter. The author described his motivation as the wish to write about consolation and encouragement facing the shadow of change and transience (\\"Welchen Trost, welche Ermutigung gibt es für uns, wenn der Schatten des Wechsels und der Vergänglichkeit auf uns fällt?\\") He wrote four stanzas in bar form, with a stollen of two lines and an abgesang of four lines. The first topic is midsummer, taken as an image for the high point of a human life. The author compares the transience of nature to that of human existence, in the Biblical context of John the Baptist saying that Jesus will increase but he [John] will decrease (). The poetry alludes to verses from Psalm 102, which call God to not end life at its height () and say that God will be forever while his creatures pass (). In the third stanza, the singer reflects unity with Jesus in the sense of the mysticism of Meister Eckhart. The conclusion is a prayer for a person finally finding God before death and then hoping for resurrection.  Melody  The text was written to a melody by that was associated with secular songs, first with the love song \\"Mit Lieb bin ich umfangen\\" (I am captured by love), then also with \\"\\" (How lovely is May), which became part of the German Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch as EG 501. \\"Das Jahr steht auf der Höhe\\" was included, slightly revised, in the 2013 German common Catholic hymnal Gotteslob as GL 465, in the section \\"Leben in der Welt - Schöpfung\\" (Life in the World - Creation).

The shrine is found in a solid granite kopje which is not different from a plethora of others that are in the vicinity. The outthrust of this shrine is situated on a mountain range that runs westwards. The shrine has \\"three naturally hidden entrances that wind up and down among overhang granite boulders.\\" The cave is not the main feature of Njelele but the gallery in the rocks. It is also endowed with a number of small tunnels, which lead to the shrine's various chambers from the narrow entrance which is between two tall rocks. Njelele is mainly known as the rain-making shrine however, it is visited for other purposes such as asking for forgiveness after society's wrongdoings, asking for cures for human and domesticated animals diseases. An assortment of skulls and horns of big game, iron hoes, clay pots containing water, cloth and beads, piles of tobacco, hatchets, and spears are kept in one of the caves at Njelele. Some scholars believe that these were objects offered to the presiding deity. In the 1960s and 70s (period of the liberation struggle in Zimbabwe), this shrine was consulted by politicians and liberation fighters. One notable member who visited the Shrine was Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo the then leader of ZIPRA and former Zimbabwean Vice President. It is believed that some time ago, a voice came from the Njelele rocks instructing those who would have visited it on what to do; even Nkomo acknowledged this in his autobiography The Story of My Life. The voice was last heard in 1974; it disappeared due to the desecration of the shrine.  Name and etymology  The Shrine is popularly known as Njelele, a Tjikalanga term which refers to a certain type of birds. In Shona it is known as Mabweadziva which means the place of spring waters. This explains why Njelele is believed to be the rain- making shrine. Another Tjikalanga name for the shrine is “Malindidzimu”, which means “The Sacred Place for Our Ancestors”. Njelele is also known as Matonjeni.  Description  Njelele is found on the Matobo Granite which is believed to be over 2.65 billion years old. The intrusive igneous rock which has an irregular oval body has a maximum east-west and north-south dimensions of almost 100 km and 30 km respectively. The shrine has \\"three naturally hidden entrances that wind up and down among overhang granite boulders.\\"  Mythology  The Njelele Shrine is believed to be a very sacred place. As such there are rules that must be followed if one wants to visit this site. The personal presence of Umlimu or Mwari (the Almighty being) was indicated by his voice. It was believed that it was a taboo to point fingers at the shrine as bad omen would follow whoever pointed their fingers to the shrine. The secret behind the respect accorded places like Njelele lies in the fact that Bantu people believed that spirits resided in caves, mountains, forests, hollow trees, and many other secluded environments. Pilgrims who visited the Njelele shrine to ask for rains were to be accompanied by the custodian of the Shrine who was believed to have the power and purity to speak to uMlimu or Mwari. During such ceremonies traditional beer would be brought by pre-pubescent girls and post-menopausal women and placed outside the entrance. Pre-pubescent girls and post-menopausal women were chosen so that the purity of the shrine would not be defiled by women who still experienced their menstrual periods. The spokesperson/custodian would, while standing a few meters away from the shrine, then clap hands and sing praises to uMlimu/Mwari asking for rains. After a certain amount of time of clapping and praising a voice would then be heard advising the visitors on what to do in order to get rains. The shrine can only be visited during August and September (before the rain season). During the time of the last moon, known as elimnyama in Ndebele, people are not allowed to visit the shrine. Unsanctioned visits are believed to disturb the peace of the shrine and result in poor rains being experienced.  Discovery and improvement  Conflictual oral traditions have made it difficult to ascertain when Njelele was first established in the Matobo Hills. Based on the Rozvi oral tradition, Njelele originated in about \\"the 14th century when the Mbire ethnic group migrated from around Lake Tanganyika southwards and eventually settled at Great Zimbabwe, a proto Shona settlement occupied between 1250-1450 AD.\\" Some scholars believe that the Mwari cult could have been established at Great Zimbabwe while other scholars thought the establishment of the Mwari shrine at Njelele could be related to \\"the shift of the Rozvi administrative power from Great Zimbabwe to the Matobo Hils.\\" Before the Ndebele adopted the Mwari cult, it had been a Shona institution. Oral tradition recalls that Lobengula kept some of the Mwari cult spirit mediums at his Bulawayo settlement so as to seek counsel from them during crises . A different version of the oral tradition states that the shrine was founded in the Matobo hills when the Great Zimbabwe experienced a religious squabble. During this dispute a breakaway group of traditional priests deserted Great Zimbabwe and established the Mwari cult in Matobo. Afterwards, several other cult centers including Zhilo and Dula were also established in the vicinity. Similar traditional institutions were in existence in the south-western parts of Zimbabwe, among the Venda and Kalanga people. Therefore, in the 19th century, priests were selected from Venda and Kalanga families who were deeply engrossed in the Mwari cult tradition.  Management  The Njelele Shrine is currently overseen by Solifa Ncube (popularly known as Khulu Thobela which means Grandpa Thobela) a traditional priest who is recognized by the community. The Shrine is open to anyone who is of the required age and gender, who comes at the required time and follows the required procedures. In the past, several parties clashed over control of Njelele. On one hand the government, on several occasions, tried to declare the shrine a National Monument ( between 1960 -1980 and between 1980 - 2000). On the other hand Sitwanyana Ncube, the Ndlovu brothers (particularly Mayabu), and Ngcathu Ncube also claimed custodianship of the shrine. The people refused to let Njelele be declared a National Monument as this could have led to the suppression of their decisions over the shrine as is the case with other areas of national interest like National Parks that have made it difficult for locals to visit for free. Conflicts among the three individuals were difficult to resolve as they all had conflicting values and goals for the shrine. They represented values carried by different groups who had personal connections with the shrine. The fight for custodianship and priesthood resulted in the flight of Ngcathu Ncube who relocated to Silawa which is 50 kilometers away from Njelele after her home was gutted by a bolt of lightning. She died in 2000, a year after relocating leaving Sitwanyana Ncube and Mayabu Ndlovu to continue the battle. Sitwanyana was then evicted by the Zimbabwe’s Liberation War Veterans Association (ZLWVA) who accused him of causing problems over the custodianship and priesthood of Njelele. They also accused him of killing his ex-wife Ngcathu Ncube whose death was mysterious. After being evicted, Sitwanyana Ncube spent months camping by the roadside near Njelele. He eventually passed away in 2006 leaving David Ndlovu as the sole custodian and priest of Njelele. There are no more known conflicts of the custodianship and priesthood of Njelele.

The name bowyang referred to a piece of cord strapped below the knee of a wearer's trousers. He wrote of swagmen, bushmen, horsemen, and the digger. Vennard also collected and preserved bush ballads. Early life With parents as drovers, Vennard was born on Vindex Station in the Winton district of western Queensland. His father Joseph Vennard emigrated from Derrykerrin, County Armagh, Ireland, arriving in 1882. His mother Janet Sutherland had arrived in Rockhampton from Scotland also in 1882, and the two were married at Rodney Downs property. Whilst his twin died, Alexander survived, and later had a sister Jane on 28 January 1886 (who later died in August 1889). Childhood life was spent at Blackbull, between Normanton and Croydon, before later becoming an apprentice at the Port Denison Times newspaper. Journalism While a little mischievous, he was also known for his inquiring mind and flair for the news. After 1910 with the closure of the paper, and marrying in Proserpine, Vennard moved and became a reporter for the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper. Leaving his wife of a couple of years, he then became a swagman around Castlereagh, New South Wales, whilst still contributing newspaper articles. Part of this break was to be done with poet Henry Lawson, in 'Ogilvie country' heading towards Coonamble, New South Wales. With the advent of World War I, Vennard enlisted in August 1914 at Coonamble, as Frank Reid, and served in the infantry in the Gallipoli campaign before transferring to the Imperial Camel Corps in Egypt. He also wrote of his impressions of Australian soldiers and their humour. While recuperating from wounds in the Camel Corps campaigns, writing as Frank Reid, he agreed to edit an Australian Imperial Forces paper leading to the creation of The Kia-Ora Coo-ee regimental newspaper. ('Kia-ora' being a Māori language phrase for 'good luck' and 'Coo-ee' being an Australian call or hail.) Returning to Australia, he contributed short stories and general literary work for two years to Smith's Weekly, before going home to North Queensland. Here, as Bowyang, he contributed to the 'On the track' articles, and the later 'On the top rail' column, in the Townsville Bulletin and North Queensland Register. He would commonly write under one name, but refer to his articles written under another name. Vennard, as Maurice Deane, also managed the 'Childrens Corner' newspaper column and the Golden Rule Club for the Bulletin and Register. Later life Daughter Jean was married to Charles John Harding in 1931, given to be one of the largest weddings in Bowen at the time. His son Jim served in World War II becoming one of the Rats of Tobruk. His son Keith served in New Guinea. Daughter Yvonne had enlisted in the WAAAF and married John Irving Medland in 1943. Jean and Yvonne continued to live in Bowen. A strong promoter of the town of Bowen and living at Sari Bair residence, Don Street, Vennard became seriously ill in his final months before passing away in February 1947. He left his wife Isabel, his two sons and two daughters.  Writings  Vennard's writings include: * Toilers of the reefs (1922) as Frank Reid, published by Whitcombe and Tombs, dealing with the natural history of the Great Barrier Reef. * 'Three Pearl Isle' (1931) as Frank Reid, a serial in the Townsville Daily Bulletin. * The fighting cameliers (1933), about the history of the Imperial Camel Corps campaign between the Suez Canal and Gaza.

The previous evening, Leneghan and a friend had been kidnapped and subjected to hours of assault, rape, and drugging in a local hotel. Her friend was shot in the head but survived. Six men were tried for their involvement in Leneghan's murder, and all received life sentences. During the trial, it was learned that four of the six defendants were on probation at the time of the attack.  Victims  Mary-Ann Leneghan was born on 13 January 1989 to an Irish father and English mother. Her parents separated when Mary-Ann was a child; Mary-Ann and her younger sister were then raised by their mother. Leneghan was a former student of Prospect College, where she showed interest in painting and music, particularly hip hop genres. Leneghan began periods of truancy in September 2004, and reportedly once went missing for a month, staying with friends in East Reading without making contact with her mother. Leneghan was unemployed, and had left Prospect College to pursue a vocational qualification in childcare. The identity of Leneghan's friend is protected by UK law; the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992 grants lifelong anonymity to people who allege that they have been the victim of rape.  Incident  In early April 2005, Adrian \\"Redz\\" Thomas, a drug dealer and violent criminal from Battersea, used a pseudonym to rent a flat on Reading's Oxford Road near Reading West railway station. In mid April, Thomas was the victim of an assault in the flat, and was robbed of money, personal possessions, and drugs. He also sustained knife wounds that required hospital treatment, but did not report the incident to the police. Thomas believed that either Leneghan or her friend, with whom he was both acquainted, had set him up for the attack. He alleged that the girls had left a door open allowing his attackers access to his property. Around this time, Leneghan's friend's house was the target of an arson attack. Thomas went back to London and returned to Reading on 6 May with five other men. Between 22:00 and 23:00, 16-year-old Leneghan and her 18-year- old friend were in a third girl's Renault Clio at the disused Wallingford Arms pub when they were kidnapped by Thomas and a group of five other men—Michael Johnson, brothers Joshua and Jamaile Morally, Indrit Krasniqi, and Llewellyn Adams. From the pub, the girls were taken to a Nissan car parked near the Wickes store on Weldale Street, approximately from the pub. The Nissan had been purchased by Adams, the gang's driver, in the preceding few days. The girls were forced into the car boot and driven approximately to the Abbey House Hotel, a guesthouse off the Oxford Road. At 01:00 on 7 May, the hotel's night manager let an annexed double room to two men who he recognised and did not see them again. The group's car was parked in the hotel's car park at the rear of the premises, which allowed the rest of the gang and the girls to enter the hotel room without passing the reception desk and night manager. At the hotel, the girls were raped, drugged, scolded and beaten for several hours. At some point between 03:00 and 05:00, the girls were driven around Reading before they were taken to Prospect Park, some west of the hotel. Here, Leneghan was repeatedly stabbed with a flick knife, sustaining 40 wounds including a punctured lung. Pathologist Vesna Djurovic noted that only one of the injuries, a neck wound, was fatal. Leneghan's friend was then stabbed before being shot in the head with a home-made bullet; she survived her injuries. After an indeterminate period of time, Leneghan's friend regained consciousness; Leneghan was heard to still be breathing. Her friend made her way to the adjacent Tilehurst Road where she was found by a commuter on foot who placed a 999 call. Police found Leneghan's body at approximately 05:30; The Telegraph reported that by the time police had discovered her, Leneghan had been dead 15 minutes.  Legal proceedings = Investigation and arrests  Shortly after the murder, Jamaile Morally handed himself in to Tooting Police Station. On 11 May, Thomas was arrested in Birmingham by armed officers from West Midlands Police; by then, five males had been arrested in connection with the incident. The night manager at the Abbey House Hotel subsequently provided a positive identification of Thomas during an identity parade. On 12 May, a female was arrested in Sandwell, West Midlands, on suspicion of assisting an offender. The same day, police confirmed that they were investigating links between the murder and the arson attack that was carried out on the home of the 18-year-old girl two weeks before the kidnap. By 13 May, a total of eight people had been arrested in connection with the murder. Johnson handed himself in to Battersea Police Station on 17 May.  Trial  The trial of six men accused of involvement in Leneghan's murder began at Reading Crown Court on 13 January 2006. The six men were gang members primarily from Wandsworth; Thomas and the Morally brothers are cousins. The charges against all six men were murder, attempted murder, multiple counts of rape, two counts of kidnapping, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In giving his evidence at the murder trial, Jamaile Morally implied that neither he, his brother, nor Krasniqi went to the park. It was concluded that Jamaile Morally had shot Leneghan's friend, and the friend identified Johnson as Leneghan's killer. On 9 February, Johnson admitted to murder, attempted murder, and kidnap. He had earlier claimed to his social worker, having met with her on 9 May, that when Thomas failed to stab Leneghan he did it instead. In March, the court heard that four of the defendants—Thomas, Johnson, Jamaile Morally and Krasniqi—were on probation at the time of the incident.  Conviction and sentencing  On 17 March, Thomas, the Morally brothers and Johnson were convicted of murder, attempted murder, kidnap, assault and rape. Johnson was found guilty of assault and rape, in addition to his earlier guilty pleas. Adams was found guilty of murder, attempted murder and kidnap, but cleared of rape and assault. Krasniqi was found guilty of murder, attempted murder, kidnap, and assault, but cleared of rape. A seventh man was charged with possession of a prohibited weapon. Sentencing of the six men took place on 28 April. All of them were sentenced to life imprisonment, with minimum terms ranging from 23 to 27 years. The judge, David Penry-Davey, recommended that Krasniqi, who was born in Afghanistan and entered the UK as a Kosovan refugee in the early 2000s, be deported to Kosovo in the event of his release. Shortly after the sentencing, on 3 May, Shadow Home Secretary David Davis MP told Parliament that Krasniqi had been recommended for deportation on his 18th birthday which fell in the two months preceding the murder. The trial heard how Jamaile Morally's mother disowned him following the incident. After sentencing, Thomas's father also disowned him. On 7 May 2012, Krasniqi and two other prisoners attacked inmate Radislav Krstić in HM Prison Wakefield in West Yorkshire, Krasniqi was found guilty of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm; the attack was described as a retaliation against Krstić's involvement in the Bosnian genocide. Krasniqi was sentenced to another life imprisonment.  Aftermath  Following the attack, Leneghan's friend was hospitalised under police guard until her discharge on 1 June 2005. Leneghan's funeral took place on 22 July 2005 at Christ Church in Reading. Her burial took place at the town's Henley Road Cemetery. A memorial service was held on the first anniversary of Leneghan's death; Thomas's father read a poem at the service. A memorial garden was established in Southcote in memory of Leneghan.

The ships are to be the largest surface warships to join the Navy since World War II. The first ship is planned to be commissioned by 2027.  Capabilities  The class is to be mission modular and is capable of accommodating so-called mission modules which include devices, space, sensors and weaponry necessary to carry out a given task optimally. If not in use, the modules can be maintained and replaced separate from the ship and also be exchanged between different ships in the class. The ships are planned to replace the Brandenburg class in their anti-submarine warfare role if fitted with a modular towed array sonar (the ASW module). Similar to the Baden-Württemberg class however, they will also be able to stay at sea for up to two years without requiring maintenance at port, with crews rotating to and from the deployed ship every four months. This capability is expected to allow for a more efficient use of hulls by reducing the time spent during transfer from Germany to conflict zones such as the sea off the Horn of Africa where German ships repeatedly took part in counter- piracy missions such as Operation Atalanta, patrolling large areas for a long time. In this case, the \\"detention module\\" enables the crew to detain suspects and if need be quarantine them in a purpose-built medical facility. Other intended uses are the enforcement of embargoes, escorting merchant shipping or commanding maritime task forces. In 2015, modules for mine countermeasures (MCM) and a diving chamber were planned as well.  Project history  First studies for a class of future surface ships were initiated in 2009. At the time, the goal was to develop a replacement for the 143A Gepard class fast attack craft. In reference to the five K130 class corvettes which were set to replace the older 143 Albatros class, the project was termed MÜKE (Mittlere Überwasserkampfeinheit) or K131. Eight ships were planned to join the navy by the early 2020s and then be available to the 2050s. The ships were to be mission modular. The Navy, increasingly tasked with conducting long overseas deployments with an aging fleet of ships influenced by cold war requirements, wished to obtain flexible ships that could be rapidly modified depending on need. This design driver, also influencing the F125 Baden-Württemberg class frigates at the time, caused the projected design to increase in displacement and complement compared to a typical corvette. By early 2011, the project was therefore expected to result in a \\"Multi-Role Combat Ship\\" (Mehrzweckkampfschiff). On March 25, 2013 the detailed requirements were formally decided on.http://www.dmkn.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Seiten-aus- MF-13-11-2-MKS.pdf During the following analysis phase, three designs were suggested, one fulfilling all requirements and two other less expensive ones fulfilling them partially. On June 8, 2015 the fully compliant design was selected. By 2015 the number of ships had been cut to four with the first hull entering service by 2023 at a planned total cost of around 4 billion Euros and two more ships in a potential second batch. The MKS 180 project would now also replace the aging F123 Brandenburg class frigates specialized on conducting anti-submarine warfare (ASW). The 2015 tender was open for bids from European companies, with Minister of Defence Ursula von der Leyen deciding not to prevent foreign bidders from participating under national security reasons. BAE Systems and German Naval Yards, Damen Group and Blohm + Voss as well as Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems and Lürssen were among the bidding teams. In mid 2017, BAE Systems, offering a ship based on the Type 26, withdrew from the tender and in March 2018 the German government excluded Thyssenkrupp and Lürssen. Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems then partnered as a subcontractor to German Naval Yards, while Lürssen effectively became a partner to Damen, having acquired Blohm + Voss in 2016. In January 2020 after a five year long bidding process the Dutch Damen Group won the tender, although the ships will be constructed at the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg, Germany and at the Peene-shipyard in Wolgast, Germany, both owned by Lürssen Group. German Naval Yards protested the award, delaying the required legally binding contract signature. However, the company withdrew its protest when it and Lürssen announced they would pool their naval shipbuilding in a joint venture and that the Kiel shipyard would participate in construction. The contract was signed on June 17, 2020. In June 2020 the German parliaments budgetary committee officially cleared 6 billion Euros for the first four ships and two options with the first ship planned to be commissioned by 2027. The contract awarded to Damen covers the ships, training facilities as well as two ASW and two detention modules and amounts to 5,48 billion Euros while weapons are contracted separately. Initial operating capability for the ships - to be based in Wilhelmshaven - is expected in 2028. Thales at its facilities in the Netherlands and Germany will provide radar, IT and fire control systems.  Controversy over contract award  Daniel Günther, Minister President of the state of Schleswig-Holstein where Kiel is located, complained in public over the decision to engage in a European tender, considering German know-how and jobs to be threatened by the governments decision. He reiterated that the construction of surface warfare ships ought to be listed as a \\"key technology\\" (Schlüsseltechnologie) which would formalise the governments ability (but not obligation) to exclude tenders on surface ships from EU competition law. According to Schleswig-Holsteins Minister of the Economy, Bernd Buchholz (FDP), this is a common practise in other European countries where government can even directly own stakes in national shipyards. He especially criticized that knowledge-intensive activities such as research and development would be occurring in the Netherlands. The union of metalworkers (IG Metall) and labour councils in shipyards and maritime subcontractors also criticized the decision, considering 15.000 jobs to be threatened in a call on the government to protect shipyards, jobs and engage with industry to bring about a \\"restructurization\\" of shipbuilding in Germany. On February 12, 2020, the cabinet decided to include the construction of surface ships among key technologies. The intention to do so had already been formalized during negotiations between the governing parties SPD and CDU/CSU in 2018. This has no impact on the MKS 180 tender, which had already been conducted Europe-wide.
