Origins and opening The City Stadium was constructed in the middle of a busy industrial area east of Brownroyd Street off the main tramway route of Legrams Lane. A railway line ran adjacent to the eastern side that carried the goods from the mills to other parts of Britain and the main industry in the immediate area was textile with dye works being particularly prominent around the stadium. Access to the track was by virtue of a bridge (if arriving from the west) over the railway track and then a lane that ran alongside the railway line (also used by those coming from the east and south). The City Stadium opened on Monday 15 August 1932 five years after the opening of the Greenfield Stadium and the main stand which backed onto the railway line and Brownroyd Street featured tote facilities and seating with further terracing and kennels on the south side by Legrams Lane. History The City Stadium was originally affiliated to the British Greyhound Track Control Society (BGTCS), one of the two organisations governing the sport and the rival to the National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC). When the BGTCS disbanded in 1935 the stadium owners the (City Greyhound and Sports Club (Bradford) Ltd) became independent (unaffiliated). Despite basic facilities the stadium was selected by Romulus films to be the backdrop of several scenes in the hugely successful 1958 film called Room at the Top. Racing in the 1960s was mainly handicaps over 470 yards on Wednesday & Saturday afternoons. Closure In 1961 the effect of the Betting and Gaming Act 1960 which allowed the opening of betting shops impacted the City Stadium with attendances and tote turnover being affected badly. An attempt to fight back was made with the owners introducing various ideas (including post racing card games) but a serious fire in 1963 caused ¬£50,000 worth of damage and the track never recovered. Greyhound racing came to an end on the Wednesday afternoon of 30 October 1965. For a short time cycling events still took place on a constructed cycling track described as a velodrome but it was soon replaced by a large warehouse. The area today remains largely industrial and the greyhound stadium would have been where the large Federal Mogul buildings are located. The lane that ran alongside the long-gone railway line is now the road leading to Federal Mogul called 'Greyhound Drive'.

Location This short street, aligned from north to south, connects Piotra Skargi and Zygmunt Krasi≈Ñski Streets. History The street is not mentioned on maps before the second half of the 19th century. Mentioned in a 1855 address book as Grostwo, a Bromberg map of 1876 by Paul Berthold Jaekel features a north-south axis bearing the name Gr√§fe Stra√üe. On this document, like on other maps, the building of the House for blind children - - appears at the northern tip of the streetUeberschitsplan der Gemarkjung Stadt Bromberg Through history, the street bore the following names: * Until 1859, Grostwo village; * 1859-1920, Gr√§fe stra√üe; * 1920-1939, Miko≈Çaj Rej Street; * 1939-1945, Gr√§fe stra√üe; * since 1945, Miko≈Çaj Rej Street. Current patron of the street is Miko≈Çaj Rej (1505‚Äì1569), a Polish poet and prose writer, politician and musician. He was the first Polish author to write exclusively in Polish language, and is considered with Biernat of Lublin and Jan Kochanowski, to be one of the founders of Polish literary language and literature. Main edifices=Tenement at the corner with Piotra Skargi Street N¬∞5 1880s Secession This tenement at then Hoffmann stra√üe 2 was the property of Ms Raa√ü in 1882, then of Emma Stengert. None of the original frontage decoration survived. The main elevation is topped by a large triangular pediment. The side facade on Miko≈Çaja Reja street displays a mural painting, \\"Self-determination\\" (), one of 20 pieces in Bydgoszcz streets.

She lived there until the end of World War I. It then moved in the 1920s to the hand of Leon Wawrzkiewicz, a manufacturer. Today, the edifice houses, among others, the \\"Paderewski Music Society in Bydgoszcz\\" (), a cultural association engaged in the development of music and musical culture in the city. This association organizes every 3 years the \\"International Paderewski Piano Competition\\" in Bydgoszcz: the 10th occurrence will happen from 6 to 20 November 2016. The facade on Piotra Skargi Street is rather common, except some nice palmette motifs inscribed in cartouches. On the other hand, the elevation on Miko≈Çaj Rej street reveals more decorative features with vegetal ornaments and a stylized festoon topped by an oeil-de-boeuf. This side of the tenement gives access to a garden, overlooked by a balcony. The wall of the garden on Miko≈Çaja Reja street displays a mural painting, \\"Time\\" (), by Bezt, Sainer, Pain, Pener, and Autone, one of 20 pieces in Bydgoszcz facades.

In the 1920s, the villa was the property of the landlord of the corner house at Piotra Skargi Street N¬∞7, Leon Wawrzkiewicz, a manufacturer. The house stands out in the street as one of the only villa onto the street, surrounded by higher tenements. One can notice the nicely wood carved motif adorning the outside cross tie beam.

In 1888, it moved to Albertine K√∂nig, who set up a pension at the place. The facility has been running till 1920 and the return of Bydgoszcz to Polish territory. Today, the edifice houses the seat of the St Peter's and St Paul's parish, which church is located a hundred metres away, on Plac Wolno≈õci. The villa displays a nice wavy gable and a roofed avant-corps onto the courtyard.

In 1883, Wilhelm Kriente, a paymaster, became the new owner; his family lived there until 1920. The tenement shows Art Nouveau elements, though many motifs disappeared with time. One can underline the two bay windows, topped by eyelid dormers, and the still preserved portal of the main entry adorned by pilasters, transom light and floral ornaments.

File:Reja 5.jpgMain elevation on the street File:Reja 5 Door.jpgGate Tenement at N¬∞7 1876, 1897 Eclecticism The tenement was initially an educational Centre for deaf children. The first project for deaf children in Bydgoszcz dates back to 1868, when the vice president of the Province of Posen, Karl von Horn, looked to set up such an institution in Bromberg region. First location identified was the Evangelical teacher seminar: it was established in 1871, and provided initially only education, while pupils were living in families. In 1876, at then Gr√§fe stra√üe 5, was built a new school, where students could live as in a boarding school, in the premises. The edifice stood next to the L. Braille special educational centre for blind children. From 1890 to 1900, it has been called Provincial Institute for the Deaf (), covering the area of the Province of Posen. In 1911, its names changed to National Institute for the Deaf. In 1922, two years after takeover by the Polish authorities, the school was transferred to Ko≈õcian. The building footprint is L-shaped. Main edifice dates back to 1897: the part giving onto Reja street housed the dormitory. The three-storey wing onto Krasi≈Ñski Street has been erected in the 1880s. The front elevation presents a small bay window. The school participated to the construction of a brick gym hall (), at the corner of streets Krasi≈Ñski Street and Gimnazjalna in 1896. Today the tenement serves as a residential area. It still boasts -despite a partial rebuilding after 1945- some preserved original woodwork on windows and doors.

The soldiers were of the 1¬™ Divisione d'Assalto \\"M\\" della Legione Tagliamento, part of the National Republican Guard of the Italian Social Republic.  The surrender  At the end of October 1943, the 1¬™ Divisione d'Assalto \\"M\\" Tagliamento was transferred to Brescia, more particularly to Val Camonica, with orders to defend the lines of communication of the Wehrmacht and the construction sites of the Organisation Todt, and to engage groups of partisans. Territorial contiguity meant that its presence also extended to the Province of Bergamo. On 26 April 1945 a group from the military garrison on the route known as the Cantoniera della Presolana commanded by Sub-lieutenant Roberto Panzanelli heard over the radio that the Nazi Fascist regime had surrendered; they accordingly decided to abandon their garrison and head for Bergamo. They set off along the valley, led by Alessandro Franceschetti carrying a white flag; he was the hotelkeeper with whom they had been billeted on the Pass of Presolana. Upon reaching Rovetta they decided to lay down their arms and surrender to the local National Liberation Committee (NLC); the latter agreed that they be treated as prisoners of war with all the attendant safeguards. Sub-lieutenant Panzanelli signed a document to this effect and had it countersigned by the parish priest, Don Bravi, a member of the NLC of Maggiore Pacifico, and others. This committee was self-proclaimed but its guarantees were worthless ‚Äì a fact unbeknown to Panzanelli. The soldiers laid down their arms and were moved to the village school pending transfer to the jurisdiction of the Italian state or to the armies of the allied forces.  Execution by firing squad  On 28 April a group of partisans belonging to the 53¬™ Brigata Garibaldi Tredici Martiri, the Brigata Camozzi and the Brigate Fiamme Verdi arrived in the village and took the soldiers from the school to a point near the local cemetery. On the way, one of the prisoners, Fernando Caciolo, managed to escape and hide, finally taking refuge in the house of the priest, Don Bravi, where he stayed for three months before returning to his home village, Anagni. Sub-lieutenant Panzanelli offered up the signed documents showing their guarantee of status as prisoners of war, but it was torn up and trampled underfoot. At the cemetery two firing squads were formed and 43 of the prisoners, all between 15 and 22 years of age, were shot. Three men were spared on account of their youth. One of the men, 20-year-old Giuseppe Mancini, the last to be shot, was forced to take part in the execution of his comrades. It later became known that Mancini was the son of Edvige Mussolini, the sister of Benito Mussolini.

It was he who gave the order for the soldiers to be removed from the school and executed. The identity of Moicano remained unknown for many decades but witness statements and documents produced at the subsequent trial showed that he had been parachuted to near Pizzo Formico at the beginning of April 1945 as a captain in the Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom) under the command of Count Manfred Beckett Czernin. His task was to make contact with partisan groups in the area, in particular with the group known as Giustizia e Libert√†. Theories that Poduje was responsible for the summary execution at Rovetta were confirmed when Moicano admitted at the beginning of the 21st century that he had indeed ordered the shooting of soldiers of the Italian Social Republic.  The trial  The Italian public prosecutor at Bergamo opened criminal proceedings in 1946. However, in 1951 it was concluded that no one could be found guilty as the summary execution was deemed not to have been a crime but an act of war.

History The house was built in 1897 for Charles Gray, an officer who fought with the Imperial Yeomanry in South Africa. By the 1930s the house was owned by Major Arthur Abrahams from whom it was requisitioned by the War Office in 1939. During the Second World War the house was used by MD1 for the development and testing of various weapons including time delay fuses, depth charges and PIAT guns. The house, which was known locally as \\"Winston Churchill's Toyshop\\", accommodated some 250 people at this time. Meanwhile Abrahams was knighted for his services to the British Red Cross in June 1942. In around 1953 the house became the Central Research Laboratories for Richard Thomas and Baldwins, iron and steel producers. This use continued until 1967 when Richard Thomas and Baldwins was nationalised as part of British Steel. The house has since been converted into offices and in 2016 was owned by Christopher Mann, Chairman of Plenham Publishing.

It is related to coeval sports such as Irish handball, fives, Basque pelota and is a possible antecedent of American handball. The sport has been continually attested since the Middle Ages and its popularity saw it become an important expression of Welsh culture, offering ordinary people opportunities through prize-money, bookkeeping and even player professionalism. Due to its cultural significance games of P√™l-law were simply referred to as Chwarae P√™l (playing ball) and it has since been described as \\"Wales‚Äôs first national sport\\". Rules and scoring P√™l-law shares many rules and its methods of scoring with other handball games, as well as squash and racquetball. A hard, leather- cased ball (a Spaldeen is often used today) is struck with the palm against a front wall. The objective is to keep the ball out of the opponent's reach but inside the bounds of play so that they are unable to return. Points are only awarded for the serving player. Scores are marked on the front wall using the traditional \\"box\\" scoring system, and formal matches are overseen by an official score marker and one referee. Whilst historically the rules varied from village to village, the scoring method remained constant and is still in use today. History=Early development Similar games to P√™l-law have been played throughout the world for thousands of years. Handball-like games have originated in several places at different times. Hieroglyphs in the temple of Osiris in Egypt portray priests taking part in a game very similar to handball. The Civilisations of South and Central America had a handball- like game, which was a large part of pre-Columbian culture. It is likely that the Welsh game has a similarly ancient origin. P√™l-law has been attested in the literature of Wales since the Middle Ages, and was mentioned by Nennius in the ninth century. There is evidence that the game was played at Tintern Abbey and Raglan Castle once held a P√™l-law court inside its Great Hall of State. Importance to Welsh culture By Tudor times, most sports in Wales were banned by order of the English Crown. Sports were banned for a number of reasons, but in Wales they were particularly seen as a distraction from the practice of archery as Welsh longbowmen were integral to the defence of the kingdom. The banned sports were also seen as encouraging gambling, violence and debauchery with only Christmas (and later Easter) seeing the ban relaxed. As sports enjoyed by the English nobility (such as jousting, bear-baiting and cock-fighting) continued with no such restrictions, the outlawed sports came to be seen as an expression of protest against the landowning class. This social context was exacerbated as authorities continued to characterise p√™l- law games as havens of mob behavior, sedition and ultimately revolt. As the Tudor period continued, laws specific to Wales were introduced which removed historic Welsh institutions and barred Welsh people (or English people with Welsh connections) from positions of authority. As such, the surviving Welsh folk-pursuits gained a unique cultural significance to ordinary people. By the fifteenth century p√™l-law had great enough social importance and popularity that the contemporary bard Guto'r Glyn could allude to it in a cywydd simply entitled Y B√™l (). National sport The game was initially played against the side of stone buildings like churches, and the sport's popularity among the Welsh populous drew the ire of both Anglican and Non-conformist leaders, with one Methodist preacher telling his congregations that handball was among the things which were ‚Äútaking the country to eternal woe‚Äù. The eighteenth century saw the construction of the first purpose built courts. The new open- backed courts were often built by the owners of public houses to attract trade and the new venues enabled P√™l-law an unprecedented popularity as a spectator sport. However, the new crowds drew more complaints from landowners, who would often refer to the games as 'fives' a very similar game played by English grammar schools. In 1744 a Joanna Lond of Swansea was accused of: \\"maintaining a certain gaming house for a certain unlawful game called fives\\" and a letter written in 1817, states the author‚Äôs objection to the transformation of the courtyard of the church at Llandaff into a \\"Fives court\\", with games interrupting services. It is likely that such instances actually helped the game maintain a distinct attraction. With Welsh language terminology, an archaic scoring system and distinct working-class culture, any vilification by the Anglican church or local authority appear to have only added to the sport's unique appeal. This era also saw P√™l-law become popular in the west of England. thumbnailleftBrecknock against all Britain! Brecon Castle Fives Court. A P√™l-law challenge for prize money by two local champions referring to the game by the English name of Fives (1786) The late nineteenth century also saw a great number of workers move to Wales and it seems the increasing population enjoyed the sport. Irish handball was a related working-class sport and it is understood that Irish migrants played the Welsh game, with the construction of the Nelson court in the 1860s possibly built with Irish railway workers in mind. Professional development With Wales' industrial development, and the sport's continued popularity, vast numbers were now able to spectate or compete and yet more players became professionals, leading to great rivalries between communities. One of the first names of national renown was Richard Edwards (\\"champion of every church yard in Denbighshire\\"). Local champions like Billy Newnam of Llantrisant and the \\"terrible Treharne twins\\" of Pontypridd also enjoyed widespread fame and adulation. It was common for competitors to travel between villages and towns to challenge the champions of other localities, often for large sums of money. By the 1870s, Dr Ifor Ajax- Lewis of Llantrisant and Richard Andrews, a miner from Nelson were offering enormous prize money to any player who could beat them. Andrews, known affectionately as ‚ÄòDic Ted‚Äô was particularly admired. Playing throughout the 1870s he played in many famous matches such as that against the 19 year old Peter Price. Peter was another miner at the nearby Taff Bargoed colliery, and their showdown was played in front of an especially large crowd at the Harp Inn in Gelligaer. Andrews would play a match against W Jones of New Tredegar for a then record purse of ¬£20. By 1875 the record winnings had increased to ¬£1000. Decline and revivals Wales endured great economic and cultural changes in the early twentieth century, with the boom Edwardian years (which saw the Welsh population grow more than 20%) followed by war, economic uncertainty and numerous industrial disasters. This societal turmoil was reflected by a decline in traditional Welsh activities such as P√™l-law, while further advances in transportation made it easier for teams and supporters to travel to the increasingly popular team sports like Rugby. The Great Depression saw a notable revival however, with P√™l-law again becoming popular as an informal and almost costless street game for impoverished workers. The revival was especially prevalent in the Swansea area, where street versions were a notable feature throughout the city as late as the 1960s. Another revival began with the formation of the Welsh Handball Association in 1987 to both preserve the Welsh game and coordinate international matches with nations playing similar games to P√™l-law. In 1995 markings for One Wall Handball were made within the three-walled Nelson court and in May that year the inaugural European One Wall Handball Tournament was held in Wales. Attended by representatives from Ireland, England, Belgium and even the USA. The tournament was based at Nelson, with Caerphilly and Bargoed also hosting matches. The new international competitions saw Welsh success in 1997 when Nelson's Lee Davies (Welsh champion throughout the 1990s) became World Champion. Courts Local courts were simply known as Y Plaen (The plain) or Plaen P√™l (Ball plain) hosted singles and doubles matches and tended to be three walled, but one walled courts were also built. Today many of the surviving courts are unplayable, with possibly the Nelson Court being the only one to be continually maintained. The Nelson Court The Old Ball Court in Nelson is a three-sided handball court constructed c.1860. The unique design is based upon the earlier court at the yard of the Nelson Inn. The landlord of the Royal Oak constructed the new court to entice more customers, especially from the Nelson Inn. The court elevated Nelson to a major centre for the game with all the great players of their day gracing the court accompanied by large excited crowds and much betting. The Nelson court was also famous for its annual tournaments held between May and August and accompanied by high levels of gambling. The court length was reduced in the 1990s due to safety concerns from the increasing traffic through the village. In May 1995 the first European Handball Tournament was held at Nelson and was attended by American, Belgian, English, Irish and Welsh teams. Recent notable players include Lee Davies, who was Welsh champion throughout the 1990s and became World Handball Champion in 1997. The Eton Fives Yearbook (1994‚Äì95) commented: ‚ÄúAdmittedly the weather was excellent, but I would ask you to envisage a court situated right in the middle of a Welsh village, with a local pub literally on the left hand side of the court and a row of terraced houses on the right, and the main road and shops behind. On Finals day you could mingle with the local spectators. We saw the soul of handball in Wales this May. This year the court there became the centre of village life. We saw the game as it was originally devised, a street game, a game of the people.‚Äù Today, the game remains a unique feature of the village with a seating area built for spectators in 2010. Jersey Marine Another surviving handball court is Burrows Court in Jersey Marine. The Court was built in 1864 by brewery owner Evan Evans. The court features a stone heart set in the highest wall and an inscription which reads Gwrol Galon Hyd Angau (a brave heart till death). This emblem is that of the 17th Glamorgan Volunteer Rifle Corps and it is thought that the court may have been used as a rifle range for the volunteers‚Äô target practice. It was here in 1875 that Dr Ivor Ajax-Lewis, the handball champion for Llantrisant, defeated Mr Lovett, the champion of Neath, in a celebrated match with ¬£1,000 in betting stakes.

His research interest only focus on two proteins: the Ca2+-ATPase of muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the Na+, K+-ATPase expressed in all animal cells. He is a professor of University of Tokyo and the Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences, USA. His research about the Ca2+-ATPase started in 1989. In the next few years, he and his colleagues obtained a series of images of Ca2+-ATPase at the revolution of Atomic-level in the world for the first time. By the x-ray crystallography, cryo-EM and other methods, he has determined the crystal structures of ten intermediates of Ca2+-ATPase. On September 10, 2015, The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded him and Poul Nissen the Gregori Aminoff Prize of 2016 for their fundamental contributions to understanding the structural basis for ATP- driven translocation of ions across membrane. Early life and education Toyoshima was born in a small town of Honjo, in the prefecture of Akita, Japan. The elementary-school education in Honjo is enthusiastic in developing children's ability in science, writing, sports, and arts. He and his old brother worked on science experiments with his mother, a high school economic home teacher. They did quite well in science research contests throughout Akita. He also showed an early flair for crafty innovation. He spent his free time on constructing plastic and wooden models of planes and ships. And when he was older, toy electronics became his pastime. The experience and success in science during his youth help him a lot when he stepped into a highly technical field, he recalled after a few decades. But the immediate effect at that time was that he considered being a doctor when he first feared the career decision. At last, he quit. Since his old brother had pursued medicine in college, he thought it was not necessary to have two medical doctors in the family. So he decided to choose another branch of science instead of literature even though he performed well in modern Japanese that his high school teacher suggested he study literature and writing in college. He finally chose Physics, a fashionable choice at that time and an easier choice than literature for him. In 1973, he was admitted by University of Tokyo on his first trial. He soon considered diligently the possibility to survive in that rigorous environment. In the first two-year, he studied standard physics but also took classes in the biochemistry and botany departments. In the middle of the third year, a visit to Setsuro Ebashi's laboratory appealed him by the description of the Electron microscope work. He decided to carry out a small project in Ebashi's laboratory, where he continued to work on microscopy of muscle thin filaments and myosin heads for his master's and doctoral research when finished his undergraduate degree in 1978. He completed his PhD in 1983. Career In 1984, Toyoshima became a research associate in University of Tokyo after he got PhD degree. Two years later, he took a postdoctoral position at the Laboratory of biophysicist Nigel Unwin in Stanford University. In Unwin's group, Toyoshima worked to develop mathematical methods for disentangling the superimposed information from a projection image, or electron micrograph, of the tubular structure. In 1988, he followed Unwin went to the Medical Research Council, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, where he met another biophysicist David Stokes, who was studying Ca2+-ATPase. He also worked with Stokes. After moving back to Japan in 1989, he joined in the Frontier Research Program at RIKEN as a research scientist. One year later, he moved to the Tokyo Institute of Technology as an associate professor in 1990. In 1994, Toyoshima was offered a faculty position at University of Tokyo, where he is currently professor of Center for Structural Biology of Challenging Proteins, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences. Research During the early research life of Toyoshima, he worked on \\"3D image analysis of muscle thin filaments decorated by myosin heads\\" as an electron microscopist in the Department of Physics, University of Tokyo. Then he turned to the acetylcholine receptor research after he went to Unwin's laboratory to study the cryo-EM in 1986. By developing a new mathematics algorithm to untangle the superimposed images obtained from the cryo-EM, he managed to reconstruct the 3D structure of ion channel at 17 √Ö resolution. This is the first one 3D structure of the ion channel. It was greeted with great excitement. Soon afterwards, the same way was applied to reconstruct the 3D structure of Ca2+-ATPase with the cooperation from David Stokes. They published their analysis of the structure of this protein in Nature in 1993. After backing to Japan, Toyoshima's later research continued to focus on the structure of Ca2+-ATPase. Through combining the x-ray crystallography and the crystallization method for EM, Toyoshima obtained large enough crystals of Ca2+-ATPase in the first state, the E1¬∑2Ca2+. Then he published it in 2000, which caused a lot of excitement at that time because it was world-first for the crystal structure of P-type ATPases at such a high revolution(2.6 √Ö). Over the years that followed, he published a series of crystal structure of Ca2+-ATPase in succession. Until now, he has determined crystal structures of this ATPase in ten different states by x-ray crystallography, covering roughly the entire reaction cycle. He also extended his research to Na+, K+-ATPase and developed a methodology for electron crystallography of ultrathin 3D protein crystals. Nowadays, he still aims at the calcium ion pump just as the direction of the footprints which he stepped on this road of adventure in the past 27 years.

Origins and Opening South of Burnley there was a large open space known as Towneley Park which served Towneley Hall and the Towneley family for five centuries. In 1902 the estate was sold to the Burnley Corporation and despite the fact that most of the park remained in situ they did agree the sale of a plot of land that ran alongside the River Calder and the Hall's north access road. This ten acre plot was in the area known as Towneley Holmes. The stadium could be accessed from either the east or west side, on the west side the path was opposite the Smalley Street junction with Woodgrove Road and cut across Towneley Park meeting the Hall's north access road. The stadium kennels were adjacent to this path situated on the north side of the stadium. From the east there was footbridge over the River Calder that met the Hall's north access road. Whichever entry was chosen resulted in the same turnstile entrances on the east side of the stadium being used where the main stand overlooked the course. A local company with a share capital of ¬£13,000 purchased and constructed the greyhound track which was a very large 570 yards in circumference. The first race night was held on 3 September 1927 with seven thousand attending the meeting opened by Lady O‚ÄôHagan. History The greyhounds initially housed at the Burnley track consisted of 100 brought mainly from Hull. The stadium came under the control of a company called the Associated Greyhound Racecourses with Towneley becoming their second of three tracks that they would eventually own. The first being Darnall Stadium and the third was the Old Craven Park in Hull. Towneley also hosted dirt track speedway in 1929. Haulage businessman Bill Sharples had a litter out of track bitch Calliope, sired by Grand National finalist Douro and trainers included Jack Hillman (a former England goalkeeper) and Jack Ashworth. In 1931 just four years after opening the Associated Greyhound Racecourses went bankrupt with the track then being taken over by a local businessman named W Spencer who closed the stadium blaming the government betting bill that restricted the days that tracks could race. With meetings limited to a maximum of 101 per annum the management put the stadium, kennels and equipment up for auction. Closure During 1935 the stadium was taken over by Captain Ramsbottom who had replaced Harry Bury as the judge and handicapper under a previous promotion. Ramsbottom then made a quick profit by selling onto two brothers Dr. and Clem Hodgson with the last greyhound meeting taking place on 2 November 1935. The buildings associated to the stadium (stands, shelters and kennels) were demolished and the track was filled in as the site became playing fields. A golf course then spread its wings north and incorporated the site into the course. The position of the stadium today would have been on the northerly holes of a golf course, exactly on the opposite side of the River Calder to the ¬£33 million Unity College.

Leonard House is a historic house on Shed Road at Crosstown Road in Berlin, Vermont. Built about 1845, it is one of the oldest houses in Berlin, built in the Berlin Corners area that was once the town center. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Description and history The Chauncey B. Leonard House stands at the northwest corner of Shed Road and Crosstown Road, about west of Paine Turnpike, a historically major north-south route through the area, and just east of Pond Brook, impounded in historic times for the construction of mills. The house is a modest 1-1/2 story wood frame Cape style structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It is five bays wide and three deep, and faces Shed Road, now the access road to the town's municipal complex. The main entrance is sheltered by a porch with Victorian turned posts and balusters, and a spindled valance above. Ground floor windows on the facade facing Crosstown Road are topped by slight projections decorated with scallop-cut shingles, and the gable above has angled siding at the peak. with The Berlin Corners area developed as a small village in the early 19th century, and became more prominent as a civic center after the town's first meeting house (located on Turner Hill) burned down in 1838. Located at the outlet of Berlin Pond, Pond Brook provided water power for grist and saw mills, and was the town's early economic center. Chauncey Leonard, a blacksmith, built his house here about 1845, and it was for many years associated with various owners of the mills. The house's Queen Anne alterations were made by Mary Perkins, who purchased it in 1892 and lived here for forty years.

Brown's novels that feature the lead character also include historical themes and Christianity as motifs, and as a result have generated controversy. Brown states on his website that his books are not anti-Christian, and that he is on a \\"constant spiritual journey\\" himself.

Sulakshan and N. Gajan were shot dead by police in Kokkuvil in northern Sri Lanka on the night of 20 October 2016. Background Vijayakumar Sulakshan was 24 years old and from Kandarodai. Nadarajah Gajan was 23 years old and from Iranaimadu. Both men were third year students at the University of Jaffna's Faculty of Arts and were studying political science and journalism. Incident On the night of 20 October 2016 Gajan attended a social event at Sulakshan's house in Jaffna. After the event Sulakshan was returning Gajan to his student hostel in Chunnakam on a motorcycle when, at around 11.30pm, the pair were shot by police at Kulapiddy junction on the Jaffna-KKS Road in Kokkuvil. According to the police the students had failed to stop at a police roadblock at the junction and sped off. The police opened fire, hitting the rider, Sulakshan, twice in the head and killing him. The motorcycle rammed into a parapet wall on the roadside which resulted in serious injuries to the passenger, Gajan. The police claimed that the students were under the influence of alcohol. Sulakshan and Gajan were rushed to Jaffna Teaching Hospital where Sulakshan was pronounced dead whilst Gajan succumbed to his injuries shortly afterwards. Aftermath A tense situation prevailed in the area after the incident as other students surrounded the hospital's mortuary. Nationally however news of the shooting was suppressed by the police and it was not until the following night (21) that the event was reported in Sri Lanka's national media. The police initially denied that there was a shooting, claiming that the two deaths were accidental. This led to accusations of a police cover-up. On the morning of 21 October 2016 Jaffna Magistrate S. Satheeshkaran arrived at the scene of the shooting to begin a magisterial inquiry. Post-mortems were carried out that afternoon and initial reports suggested that bullets were found in the victims' bodies. Sulakshan was reported to have been shot three times and had injuries to his chest, neck and spine. Gajan was reportedly shot at least once. According to the official Judicial Medical Officer's report, Sulakshan was killed by a shot in the chest and Gajan died of head injuries sustained during the crash into the wall. The students bodies were returned to their parents but they were ordered to bury them rather than cremate. After the post-mortem contradicted the police's earlier statement officers from the Criminal Investigation Department were sent to take over the investigation. On 22 October 2016 five police personnel (a sub-inspector, a sergeant, two constables and a driver) were arrested and remanded until 4 November 2016. Expressing grief at the deaths, President of Sri Lanka Maithripala Sirisena ordered an impartial inquiry and compensation for the students' parents. The shooting was condemned by the Tamil National Alliance, the largest political party representing Sri Lankan Tamils.

Women's Voice  In reports from TechCrunch and other publicly accessible websites, Cheryl reported her unpleasant encounter with a leader of 500 Startups, David McClure, which caused emotional distress.  Sexual Harassment in Silicon Valley  In 2017, Yeoh came forward and published her account of the sexual harassment she experienced in 2014. Yeoh‚Äôs claims were against Dave McClure who had recently resigned from 500 Startups after allegation by another woman. In the account, posted online after founder Sarah Kunst and Susan Yin‚Äôs accusations, Yeoh alleges that McClure repeatedly harassed her while in Malaysia. In an interview to the BBC, she recounted the incident stating, ‚ÄúI felt like it wasn't a rare thing, it was considered normal in the start-up world, the tech world\\". In a follow up interview, Yeoh announced that she would not be pressing charges against McClure as her main goal was to raise awareness about sexual harassment and abuse of power, specifically in the tech world.  #MovingForward  Following the release of her account, Cheryl Yeoh worked with co-founder Andy Coravos to establish the #MovingFoward public directory. The #MovingFoward directory includes dozens of tech oriented top tier venture capital firms that have posted their reporting contacts and have publicly committed to a protocol of improving anti-harassment, anti-discrimination, diversity and inclusion measures in the workplace. Launched to coincide with international Women‚Äôs Day in May 2018 the movement is specifically aimed at giving young entrepreneurs who are often reluctant to speak out against investors, a forum where they may speak openly about harassment.

She is known both for her advocacy of women's rights and for her support of Islamism. Al-Badawi holds degrees from the University of Khartoum and the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, and became a professor of Arabic at Omdurman Islamic University in 1980. Her association with Islamism began in the 1950s, when she was one of the first female members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Al-Badawi later joined the National Islamic Front, and beginning in the 1980s represented the party for several terms in the National Legislature. She also served in the Pan-African Parliament. Early life and academic career Al-Badawi was born in Al- Ubayyid, Kurdufan Province. Her paternal grandfather was a prominent Islamic scholar in Omdurman, while her father was a district commissioner, in office during both the Anglo-Egyptian condominium and after independence in 1956. Because of her father's work, al-Badawi lived in a number of different cities as a child, spending periods in Al-Ubayyid, Berber, Atbara, Khartoum, and Omdurman. She completed her secondary education with the support of her father, who had liberal views towards girl's education despite the prevailing societal attitude at the time. Al-Badawi went on to complete a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) at the University of Khartoum in 1956, as one of the first four women to graduate from the Faculty of Arts. She worked as a high school teacher for a period, and then went to England for further study. In 1961, she graduated from the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London with a Master of Arts (M.A.) in Arabic. After returning from England, al-Badawi was appointed head of the history department at a teacher's college. She later worked in Khartoum as an inspector for the Ministry of Education. In 1969, al-Badawi moved to Saudi Arabia to work a consultant for UNESCO. She was involved in the establishment of the Girls' College of Education in Riyadh, and served as the college's dean for a period, as well as editing the college magazine. Returning to Sudan, al-Badawi completed a doctorate in Arabic at the University of Khartoum in 1974, and in 1980 was made an associate professor in Arabic at Omdurman Islamic University (OIU). After a brief spell as a deputy vice-chancellor at United Arab Emirates University, she returned to OIU in 1983 to become dean of the women's college, becoming the first woman to hold the position. In the early 1990s, al-Badawi spent a sabbatical as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. Politics Al- Badawi's first involvement in politics came as a leader in various women's groups of the 1950s and the 1960s. She represented Sudan at several international gatherings, including the 1952 Arab Women's Conference and the 1957 Soviet Women's Conference. Al-Badawi's initial involvement was with the Sudanese Women's Union, but she and several others left that group due to ideological conflicts. She subsequently helped establish an Islamist women's group, the National Women's Front, having earlier been one of the first female members of the Muslim Brotherhood. In 1981, al-Badawi became a member of the National People's Council, the legislature of Sudan under President Gaafar Nimeiry. She later served in the National Assembly from 1996 to 2005, and in 2004 was elected to the Pan-African Parliament.Akyeampong and Gates, p. 340. For a period in the mid-1980s, al-Badawi was one of only two female legislators in Sudan. She was a member of the National Islamic Front, an Islamist party, and one source has called her \\"the most visible Islamist woman activist\\" in Sudan at the time. At an international forum in 1996, al-Badawi spoke of Islam and feminism as mutually exclusive, and rejected the idea of \\"Islamic feminism\\" as incompatible with taqwa (piety). Journalism In 1956, al-Badawi became the first editor of Al-Manar (\\"The Beacon\\"), a weekly magazine published by the women's bureau of the Muslim Brotherhood. The following year, she led a delegation of female Sudanese journalists to France and the United Kingdom. The initial run of Al-Manar lasted less than a year, but the magazine was re-established in 1964 and was said to have had some influence on female voters in the 1965 general election. In later years, al- Badawi produced a weekly television and radio program, and worked as a columnist for various Sudanese newspapers.

Origins and opening The Old Road Ground was located south of the gas works and water works on Anchor Road and was originally used by Clacton Cricket Club. In 1905, Clacton Town was invited to use the ground and a wooden stand was built. The cricket club later folded and was replaced by Clacton St Paul's between 1918 and 1923.Our grounds F.C. Clacton The council, which owned the ground, forced it to be rebuilt in 1935 so that a new car park could be put in its place. As a result, the pitch was shifted fifty yards to the west. A new wooden stand was erected for Clacton's first match in the new Eastern Counties League on 31 August 1935, with the original stand in one corner of the ground and an uncommissioned railcar being used as changing rooms. A new 500+ seat concrete stand was built after World War II, with a covered terrace built in the southeast corner in the 1950s. A further covered terrace had been installed by the time the greyhound racing arrived in 1967. Clacton's record attendance at the ground of 3,505 was set for an FA Cup match against Romford in September 1952. Greyhound Racing In 1967, the council constructed a greyhound track around the outside of the existing football pitch used by F.C. Clacton. This action required the stands to be dismantled and the pitch to be shifted once again. The back straight (or far terracing) became inaccessible and a totalisator office was built on the end of the main stand, another alteration was the permanent addition of a portakabin used as the Greyhound Bar and Caf√©. The changing face of the ground did not please the football supporters and when in 1974 the council gave six months' notice to the club, the outlook was bleak. However, the council subsequently offered a recurring one year licence afterwards. The tourism boom in Clacton-on-Sea had reached its crescendo by 1970 but the greyhound operation continued for over a decade using an 'Outside Sumner' hare and race distances of 240, 450 & 650 yards. On 3 August 1984, the management headed by General Manager Mr. J. Carolan and Racing Manager John Old joined the National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) bringing affiliation to a governing body but also increasing costs. The race distances were 213, 404, 570, 760 & 925 metres. Closure In 1985, the council announced that they planned to sell the nine acre site to developers who wished to build a retail park. The last football game took place on 21 February 1987 and the final greyhound meeting occurred one week later on 27 February 1987. The site was demolished the same year and turned into the retail park. The site today is between Halfords and Morrisons.

However, the most prominent feature of the church, and the most commonly visited tourist attraction in the town, is the main altarpiece: a Crucifixion (circa 1529-1530) by Lorenzo Lotto. The work was commissioned by Bishop Bonafede for the church, painted mainly in Venice, and completed in situ in the present frame circa 1534. Lotto was paid 100 gold florins and a quantity of olivo oil. The signature on the painting was not discovered until 1831.Province of Macerata, tourism office, entry on church. The scene depicts three levels: *Christ and the two robbers are crucified against a darkening sky. *A disorganized rabble of soldiers, some on horseback, mill below the crosses, with multiple askance spears.

The first run was organised by Macleod High School, who chartered a train in March 1958 with 200 students from Melbourne, running to Warrnambool, Hamilton, Portland, Stawell, Bendigo, Echuca, Kyabram and back to Melbourne. The Victorian Railways operated the train through to 1976, then VicRail and the Public Transport Corporation operated the service until 1989, when the train was withdrawn. All of the carriages were preserved and most ended up with the Seymour Rail Heritage Centre, who continued to run tours on occasion until 2004. Rollingstock=Original The train was formed originally with whatever rolling stock was available, but within a few years it had settled to a standard consist made up to carry between 80 and 90 school children, 6 teachers and four railway staff members. As of 1976, the consist used up to five of the six available E type sleeping cars, each with 20 berths; plus the shower car Carey, formerly a horsebox; Melville, a former royal carriage used to provide power for lighting, heating and cooking; 43BPL (a former sitting carriage) used as a classroom; and Avoca as the dining car for the train, with 48 seats allowing serving the whole train meals in two sittings. Refurbished During the early 1980s the Victorian and New South Wales railway authorities were looking at merging the two overnight standard gauge trains, the Spirit of Progress and Southern Aurora, and this would have freed some sleeping carriages for the Vinelander service to Mildura; its sleeping carriages 1-4 and 11-14 could then be cascaded to the Train of Knowledge, replacing the older sleeping carriages 5 through 10. In expectation of this switch over, maintenance of the older carriages was allowed to run down in anticipation of them being scrapped. However, by the end of 1983 the carriage cascade had not yet started, while schools around Victoria still wanted to lease the train. VicRail relented and started a refurbishment program, with cars 5, 7, 8 and Carey sent to Bendigo for refurbishment and 6, 9, 10, Melville and Avoca to either Ballarat or Newport.Newsrail January 1984 p.60 At the same time, the former buffet car allocated to The Gippslander, Moorabool, was superseded by new BRN and refurbished BRS cars with buffet modules fitted, so it was used to replace the worn-out 43BPL.Newsrail May 1997 The scope of the refurbishment was to ensure a further three years of operation.Newsrail March 1984 p.88 Dining car Avoca had its old, reportedly dangerous gas-fired cooking equipment replaced, ventilation added to the roof of the car, the deep fryer removed and a freezer added at the saloon end of the kitchen (in lieu of a small freezer fitted to Melville), and replacing of the floor.Newsrail March 1984 p.88 The power supply in Melville was upgraded to better cater for both Avoca and Moorabool.Newsrail March 1984 p.88 Shower car Carey had its bank safe removed, and each shower cubicle had the hot and cold pipes recessed behind cover plates instead of being exposed.Newsrail March 1984 p.88 Moorabool was stripped internally at Ballarat Workshops from November 1983, and the former kitchen door was sealed as part of these works, as had been done to sister car Tanjil when it was converted to standard gauge. The car was fitted out as an open-plan classroom with whiteboards for lessons and a non-slip floor fitted, at a total cost of $200,000. Investigations were made at the time into fitting the car with a diesel alternator, as a backup or alternative source of power to Melville.Newsrail March 1984 p.88 43BPL was retained as a standby carriage in case the work on Moorabool took longer than intended, but it was finally withdrawn in November 1984 and allocated to the Australian Railway Historical Society for preservation.http://pjv101.net/cd/pages/c133d.htm Moorabool was first used in the consist on 15 October 1984, with a stripped Murray substituting in the intervening period.Newsrail December 1984 p.377 The six sleeping carriages were all upgraded. Each had the upholstery and taps fixed or replaced as required, and cars 7, 8, 9 and 10 had tail lamp brackets and taildiscs fitted to permit them to mark the end of the train, matching 5 and 6. Fly-wire screens were not fitted, to make cleaning of the windows easier, but clear glass was installed in the vestibule doors. The gas heaters were removed from each conductors' compartment except that in No.6 (nominally reserved for train crews), and redesignated as storage areas. Cars 9 and 10 were fitted with pressurised water systems, in lieu of the original rooftop water filling points. Lastly, all six sleepers had their original names restored - No.5 through No.10 respectively returning to Wando, Acheron, Coliban, Inman, Pekina and Loddon.Newsrail March 1984 p.88 In addition to the restored names, all vehicles were repainted into a bright red livery with black underframe and tan roof. Previously, Carey, Melville, Avoca and Sleeping Car No.5 had been painted blue with yellow stripes, while the rest of the train was in a faded red. The cars entered their respective workshops in December of 1983, and the train was reassembled for new bookings from May 1984.Newsrail January 1984 p.60 The first sighting of the train back in service was Friday 25 May 1984, at Spencer Street Station and hauled by locomotive T407.Newsrail August 1984 p.248 A photo dated 28 September 1985 shows the train with three sleepers either side of the shower car, followed by Moorabool, Avoca and Melville at the west end. Circa 1988-89, it is known that at least Coliban had been fitted with end-of-train marker lights and a lamp bracket. Tour descriptions Students and school staff members were expected to supply their own bedding for fitting to the carriage berths, but much of the rest of the requirements were provided as part of the service. Circa late 1970s, VicRail (as it then was) provided an insurance cover of $1,000,000 against personal injury, included in the cost of the trip. Post-1976, four Monday to Friday tour options were offered: Tour 1, South West The first tour covered Victoria's western and south western districts, with stops at Maldon and Castlemaine, the Great Western winery, Tower Hill reserve, Port Campbell coastline, Warrnambool, the Grampians, Port Fairy and various Geelong industries. Students were charged $107 each. Tour 2, Central North The second tour covered Victoria's central northern region, with stops at Maldon and Castlemaine, Ballarat with the Eureka Stockade, Sovereign Hill and the Mine tour, Bendigo with the Epsom pottery, the talking tram, Sandhurst town and Lake Weroona, Swan Hill including the Pioneer Settlement (with the Sound & Light tour), a paddlesteamer cruise, the Clock Museum, the Tyntyndyer Homestead and The Big Grape. Tour 3, Gippsland The third tour explored Victoria's eastern region, running to Sale RAAF base, Bairnsdale, the Buchan caves, a timber mill at Nowa Nowa and the town of Lakes Entrance, along with a cruise to Metung, the Morwell open cut mine, Gippstown folk museum and the Glenmaggie Weir.

On display are especially royal coaches, barouches, sledges, litters and even a carousel. Marstallmuseum Nymphenburg Coronation coach of Emperor Charles VII.  History  The rich holdings of the Wittelsbach were already exhibited in the first half of the 19th century just like at the Viennese Court. At the end of the Monarchy in 1918, the vehicle stock was about 300, some of which were no longer fit for driving. Lastly, cars were also managed by Marstall. After the end of the monarchy, the remaining high-quality exhibits were exhibited from 1923 in the former Court Riding School at Marstallplatz. This area east of the Munich Residenz was largely destroyed in 1944 by air raids. Already before 1941, the collection had been transferred to Nymphenburg Palace. Thus, today's Marstallmuseum is located in the rooms of the former court stables in the southern Building of Nymphenburg Palace. It was opened in 1952. In 1986, a refurbishment and new conception took place.  Exhibition  Centrepieces are the splendid chariot of Elector Charles Albert (1726-1745), which he used on the occasion of his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor in 1742 and the two coronation carriages of King Maximilian I Joseph (1799-1825). Built for a private order of King Ludwig II (1864-1886), the five carriages and sledges came into the collection only after his death in 1886. The portrait gallery of his horses, which Ludwig II had made by the painter Friedrich Wilhelm Pfeiffer, is also represented. Less elaborate, but very elegant are the coaches from the time of the Prince Regent Luitpold (1886-1912). Since 2012, the newly restored Hercules sledge of the Bavarian Elector Max Emanuel (1679-1726) and the pompous litter of his first consort, the Austrian princess Maria Antonia have been put on display as well.

A specialist sprinter, he began his racing career in Spain where he won two races as a two-year-old in 2007. He began his second season in France, winning the Listed Prix des Sorbiers before being sent to England where he recorded an upset victory in the Group One King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot. He was then relocated to England but failed to win in 2009 before returning to his best form as a five-year-old in 2010. In that year he won the Abernant Stakes and the Palace House Stakes before winning the King's Stand Stakes for a second time. After his retirement from racing he became a breeding stallion and had had some success as a sire of winners. Background Equiano was a bay horse with no white socks on his hind legs bred in France by Ecurie Skymarc Farm. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Acclamation, a high-class sprinter who won the Diadem Stakes in 2003. The best of his other progeny was Dark Angel, who won the Middle Park Stakes before becoming a successful breeding stallion. Equiano's dam Entente Cordiale showed little ability as a racehorse, producing her best effort in three races when finishing third in a maiden race at Cork Racecourse in March 2002. She was a descendant of the American broodmare Mock Orange, the ancestor of several good winners including Cryptoclearance, Devil May Care and Regal Ransom (UAE Derby). As a foal in December 2005 Equiano was offered for sale at Deauville and was bought for ‚Ç¨26,000 by Cuadra Madro√±os SL. He entered the ownership of F√©lix S√°nchez Blanco and was sent to race in Spain where he was sent into training with Mauricio Delcher S√°nchez near Madrid. Racing career=2007: two-year-old season As a two-year-old in Spain, Equiano ran five times in Spain winning races at San Sebasti√°n in August and at Madrid's La Zarzuela racecourse in September. On his final appearance of the year he was sent to France to contest the Group Two Crit√©rium de Maisons-Laffitte over 1200 metres on 2 November. He started the 25/1 outsider of the nine-runner field but kept on well in the closing stages to finish third behind the German colt Pomellato. 2008: three-year-old season Though still based in Spain, Equiano was campaigned in France in the spring of 2008, beginning the season by finishing second to Verba in the Prix Le Sancy over 1200 metres at Maisons- Laffitte on 7 April. On 20 May the colt was partnered by Olivier Peslier when he started 1.7/1 favourite for the Listed Prix des Sorbiers over 1100 metres at Chantilly Racecourse and won by two lengths from Jane Blue. He was then moved up in class for the Group Three Prix du Gros Ch√™ne over 1000 metres at Chantilly on 1 June. Ridden by Christophe Soumillon he started an 18/1 outsider but exceeded expectations as he took the lead in the last 200 metres before being overtaken and beaten a neck by the leading French sprinter Marchand d'Or. After his runs at Chantilly the colt was sold to James Acheson who kept him under Spanish-based training. On his next appearance, Equiano was sent to England to contest the Group One King's Stand Stakes over five furlongs at Royal Ascot on 17 June in which he was ridden by Peslier and started a 22/1 outsider in a thirteen-runner field. The favourite for the race was the filly Fleeting Spirit, whilst the other British runners included Kingsgate Native, Benbaun (Prix de l'Abbaye), Dandy Man (Palace House Stakes), Hoh Mike (Sprint Stakes), Moorhouse Lad (King George Stakes) and Enticing (Molecomb Stakes). The other international challengers were Takeover Target and Magnus (The Galaxy) from Australia, Abraham Lincoln from Ireland and National Colour from South Africa. Racing up the stands side (the left-hand side from the jockeys viewpoint) Equiano led from the start and always looked the most likely winner despite hanging slightly right in the closing stages. He won by half a length and a neck from Takeover Target and Fleeting Spirit. After the race Peslier commented \\"He ran very well in France last time and today was the big ambition. The horse has a lot of speed and he travels well. The trainer said he would be better to stay behind and get cover but I said over five furlongs he'd be better in front. He was handy and everything went right for him\\". After his win at Ascot Equiano remained in England and was transferred to the stable of Barry Hills at Lambourn. In August he started favourite for the Nunthorpe Stakes (run that year at Newmarket Racecourse) but finished fourth behind Borderlescott, National Colour and Kingsgate Native. On his final run of the season he finished ninth behind Marchand d'Or in the Prix de lAbbaye at Longchamp Racecourse on 5 October. 2009: four-year-old season In most of his races as a four-year-old, Equiano was ridden by his trainer's son Michael Hills. He produced his best performance on his seasonal debut when he started favourite for the Abernant Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in April and finished second, beaten half a length by the seven- year-old gelding Tax Free. Equiano failed to win or place in his remaining eight races in 2009. He finished well beaten in the Duke of York Stakes, Prix du Gros Ch√™ne, King's Stand Stakes, July Cup, King George Stakes, Nunthorpe Stakes, Haydock Sprint Cup and Prix de l'Abbaye. 2010: five-year-old season Equiano began his fourth season in the Abernant Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket on 15 April in which he was ridden by Michael Hills (as in all of his races that year) and started the 11/4 favourite. After taking the lead soon after the start he was hard-pressed in the closing stages and \\"just held on\\" to win by a short-head from the four-year-old Mullionmileanhour and record his first success for 22 months. In the Group Three Palace House Stakes at the same course on 1 May he started second favourite behind the 2009 winner Amour Propre in a field which also included Borderlescott, Sole Power and Total Gallery (Prix de l'Abbaye). Equiano led from the start and \\"stayed on gamely\\" to beat Borderlescott by three quarters of a length. Barry Hills commented \\"Michael rode him last Saturday and said he gave him the best feeling a horse had given him. I am sure the King's Stand will be on the agenda, but I'm not sure if we'll have another race first\\". Three weeks later Equiano started joint-favourite alongside Kingsgate Native in the Temple Stakes at Haydock Park. He led for most of the way but was overtaken by his market rival inside the final furlong and beaten half a length into second place. On 15 June Equiano attempted to repeat his 2008 success in the King's Stand Stakes and started the 9/2 third choice in the betting behind Kingsgate Native and the Australian challenger Nicconi (winner of the Lightning Stakes). The other nine runners included Borderlescott, Total Gallery, Amour Propre, Gold Trail (Railway Stakes) and Markab. Equiano quickly took the lead and \\"ran on gamely\\" in the final furlong to win by one and a half lengths from Markab with Borderlescott taking third ahead of Nicconi. After the race Barry Hills said \\"He's a very fast horse and he was always going to win today because he's in such good form.\\" Michael Hills said, \\"He stumbled coming out of the gates but once he was back on his feet he was off. What a thrill! Someone beeped a car horn at the three pole and he went even faster.\\" On 9 July the horse returned to six furlongs for the July Cup at Newmarket and finished second of the fourteen runners, beaten half a length by the Australian import Starspangledbanner. In the Nunthorpe Stakes at York Racecourse on 20 August he started slowly, was hampered in the first furlong and never looked likely to win. Michael Hills eased the horse down in the closing stages and Equiano finished last of the twelve runners behind Sole Power. A training setback prompted the announcement of his retirement on 15 September. Barry Hills commented \\"Equiano was one of the fastest horses I have trained and the exceptional speed he demonstrated in winning this year's King's Stand Stakes marked him out as a very special sprinter. He was also a very sound horse and a perfect horse to deal with in every way.\\" Stud career After his retirement from racing, Equiano became a breeding stallion at the Newsells Park Stud in Hertfordshire. He has also been shuttled to stand in Australia for the southern hemisphere breeding season. The best of his offspring have been The Tin Man (British Champions Sprint Stakes) and Strath Burn (Hackwood Stakes).

Towey Michael John Towey (June 17, 1902 ‚Äì September 29, 1960) was an organized labor leader and Democratic politician from Philadelphia. Towey was born in 1902 in County Mayo, Ireland, the son of Joseph and Ann Towey. He emigrated to the United States at the age of 15 and graduated from Philadelphia's Northeast High School. He later attended the University of Pennsylvania before graduating with an engineering degree from Drexel Institute of Technology. After graduating, Towey worked as a plumber and became the business representative of the United Association of Plumbers. He was later elected the president of Plumbers Union Local 690. Towey also became involved in Democratic party politics, running for the Democratic nomination in the 5th state Senate district in 1936. He fared poorly, placing a distant second to the machine candidate, Israel Stiefel. Towey's prospects with the party improved by 1947, when he and Anthony Massing were nominated without opposition for Philadelphia City Council in the 5th district (the district sent two members to Council at the time). They went down to defeat in November against Republican nominees Louis Schwartz and Frederic Garman. Towey solidified his position in the party three years later when he defeated the machine-backed incumbent to become ward leader of the 19th ward (located in West Kensington). In 1951, he ran again for City Council from the river wards' newly drawn 6th district and was elected with 55% of the vote. Towey's election was part of a Democratic wave that combined with independent, pro- reform Republicans to sweep the Republican machine from power for the first time in 67 years. The Democrats had come to power in the city because of their backing of a new city charter that reduced waste and mandated civil service reform. By 1954, however, Towey joined fellow Democrat James Hugh Joseph Tate in an effort to weaken the civil service reforms of the new charter. They fell just of the two-thirds vote in Council to put their amendments on the ballot. The following year, he was reelected with a slightly increased majority of 56%. In 1956, Towey and Tate again proposed charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections and this time found the required vote to put it on to the ballot for popular approval. The referendum failed in a vote that April. In 1959, Towey ran for a third Council term and defeated Republican Stanley Bednarek with 60.3% of the vote, his greatest margin to date. The next year, he suffered a heart attack at his Juniata Park home and died at the age of 58. He was survived by his wife, the former Pearl Weidmayer, and was buried in Philadelphia's North Cedar Hill Cemetery.

His research covers a variety of workplace topics, including the science of workplace excellence, achieving top performance, and the connection between health, happiness, and productivity. Friedman is also a regular contributor to the Harvard Business Review, penning widely read articles such as \\"How to Spend the Last 10 Minutes of Your Day\\", \\"9 Productivity Tips From People Who Write About Productivity\\", and \\"Regular Exercise is Part of Your Job\\", where he covers engaging and counter-intuitive ideas such as lowering the temperature, leaving tasks unfinished, and leveraging team sports in order to work at your peak. While all are research-backed claims, Friedman's articles go past the science of optimum performance to bring actionable tips to improve everything from your sleep to your credibility at work. Friedman‚Äôs first book, The Best Place to Work: The Art and Science of Creating an Extraordinary Workplace, published in 2014, used the \\"latest research from the fields of motivation, creativity, behavioral economics, neuroscience, and management,\\" to understand what makes people successful at work. The book presents stories and research in an effort to provide leaders with techniques \\"to promote smarter thinking, greater innovation, and stronger performance.\\" Among the many surprising insights, Friedman explains how learning to think like a hostage negotiator can help you defuse a workplace argument, why placing a fish bowl near your desk can elevate your thinking, and how incorporating strategic distractions into your schedule can help you reach smarter decisions. Along the way, the book introduces the inventor who created the cubicle, the president who brought down the world‚Äôs most dangerous criminal, and the teenager who single-handedly transformed professional tennis‚Äîvivid stories that offer unexpected revelations on achieving workplace excellence. The Best Place to Work is available in print, eBook, and in an unabridged audio edition narrated by Walter Dixon, was an INC. Magazine Best Business Book of the Year and was hailed as a ‚Äúmust read‚Äù from the Library Journal. Publishers Weekly called the book \\"an energetic, conversational look at what really makes an office environment tick.\\"  Bibliography = Books  *  Audio  *  Selected articles    * *  References  External links  Category:1977 births Category:American psychologists Category:21st-century American writers Category:University of Rochester alumni Category:City University of New York alumni Category:Living people ","title":"Ron Friedman (author)"},{"id":"52075887","title":"Fastlane (2017)"},{"id":"52075889","title":"All These Countless Nights"},{"id":"52075900","text":"Hooked Up may refer to: * Hooked Up (film), a 2013 Spanish horror film * Hooked Up (TV series), a 2004 reality television series * Hooked Up Records, an independent record label ","title":"Hooked Up"},{"id":"52075915","text":"Lyc√©e Henri Sellier is a railway station located on the √éle-de-France tramway Line 4 in the commune of Livry-Gargan.

His eminent book in Islamic sciences is Usul al-Fiqh or the principles of jurisprudence written according to the thought school of Agha Shaykh Muhammad Hosein Isfahani, one of the eminent Shia Marja's. Introduction His family by the name of Muzaffar counted as one of eminent families in Najaf. His family includes many scholars and men of religious learning. Most of them are known as Muzaffar in that city since the twelfth century of the Hijrah. Some of his relatives are inhabitants of Basra in Iraq and reside in al-Jaza‚Äôir. His father, named Muhammad ibn Abdullah, a jurist and Mujtahid was a Marja' taqlid. His father was also born and educated in Najaf. He spent his youth in study, his only other activity being prayer and teaching until he had distinguished himself as a jurist. He wrote a very comprehensive commentary on the book of Shara‚Äôi al-Islam which he called Tawhid al-Kalam. One of his achievements was establishment of \\"Montada Al Nashar\\" or publication of Montada to develop and publicize the most important Islamic books. He also founded the faculty of jurisprudence (fiqh) in Najaf University which includes courses such as comparative fiqh, Shia jurisprudence etc.http://www.ensani.ir/fa/content/45107/default.aspx Eminent scholars like Muhammad Taqi Jafari sought an association with al-Muzaffar. Early life Muhammad Rida al-Muzaffar was born on the fifth of Sha'ban, 1322 AH (1904 AD). Since his father died before him, his brother Abdun-Nabi became responsible for raising him. Muhammad Rida grew up in the scholarly environment of Najaf. Like many ulama, he participated in a variety of courses and scholarly circles, leading to the completion of his advanced education in religious seminaries. His early teachers were his brothers Abdun-Nabi and Muhammad Hasan.http://www.introducingislam.org/info/muzaffar/chapter7.php Scholarly opinions He has many opinions in different domains of Islamic learning like usul al fiqh, logic and fiqh. Usul al-fiqh One of his innovations in the domain of usul is to present new divisions on the subjects of Usul. According to the school of thought of his master, Muhammad Husein Isfahani, Muzaffar believes in new orderness on the subjects. For instance, before him, the subject of Ishtighagh (derivatives) has to discuss in the partition of alfaz not introductions. As a result, he divided subjects into four categories: alfaz, rational discussion (mabahith aqliyyah), hujjat, usul Amaliyyah (practical principles).

The refuge covers a roughly rectangular area of the Atlantic Ocean extending southeast from the coast between Rio Preto in the south and Pontal do Piraquea√ßu in the north. A survey to provide information on creation of the conservation unit found 116 species of vascular plants in the salt marches and mangroves and 560 species of algae. The algae provide substrate, shelter and food for the diverse marine fauna. History The Santa Cruz Wildlife Refuge was created by federal decree on 17 June 2010. The management plan was to define fully protected areas and areas that could be used for small-scale fishing for subsistence purposes. It is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation. It became part of the Central Atlantic Forest Ecological Corridor, created in 2002. The consultative council was created on 23 November 2010. The refuge is classed as IUCN protected area category III (natural monument or feature). Objectives are to protect biological diversity and natural environments, including the mangroves and coastal vegetation important for species that use the area for feeding and breeding, and for stabilizing the coastline, to support compatible tourist, recreational and educational use of the seafront, and to contribute to recovery of biological resources and sustainability of fisheries and small- scale subsistence extraction by the coastal communities in the region around the unit.

It was built in 1814‚Äì16 as a Methodist church and converted into a Sikh place of worship in the late 1970s. The main hall is Grade II-listed; the former Soldier's Institute and Sunday School next door, now in use as a langar, is not.  Location  The gurdwara and langar are situated on an irregular quadrilateral plot of about 1500 m¬≤ (0.37 acre) on the corner of Calderwood Street and John Wilson Street (part of the A205 or South Circular Road). The plot is at the northside of Calderwood Street, which at this point slopes down towards the east. This street was called William Street at the time when the Methodist church was built. It was renamed Calderwood Street in 1938, after a local industrialist and Woolwich Polytechnic chairman. The south-eastern section of Calderwood Street is part of Bathway Quarter, a designated conservation area; the gurdwara and langar are not.  History = Methodist church  The first Wesleyan Methodist congregation in Woolwich was established in 1789 by a carpenter at the Warren, Thomas Murrell. A chapel was built on Woolwich New Road, a site that is now occupied by the east end of Equitable House. As this chapel was soon outgrown, in 1812 a plot on the north-west side of William Street (now Calderwood Street) was leased from the Powis Estate. Building started in 1814 and the church was completed two years later at a cost of ‚Ç§4,594. In 1817 a Sunday school for 400 children was built immediately to the east of the chapel. This building was replaced in 1889‚Äì90 by the current building designed by Walter Whincop, after a legacy was left by a former Sunday school superintendent. The new building would also house the Soldiers' Institute, the Methodist church being an official garrison chapel for nonconformists. Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 234, 295, 297.  Sikh gurdwara  The Soldiers' Institute closed after the Second World War and church attendance dwindled to around fifteen in 1977. A redevelopment scheme for the site was blocked by Greenwich Council after the chapel was listed in 1973. In 1977 the two buildings were put up for sale and shortly afterwards acquired by the local Sikh community to be converted into a gurdwara, which has been its function ever since. During the harvest festival (Visakhi), thousands of Sikhs march in procession (Nagar Kirtan) through Woolwich, starting at the Gurdwara Ramgarhia in Masons Hill and finishing at the Gurdwara Sahib in Calderwood Street.Sikh procession to take part in Woolwich on April 11 starting on Masons Hill on newsshopper.co.uk, 7 April 2015.  The buildings  The Woolwich Sahib Gurdwara consists of two buildings: the former Wesleyan church hall of 1816, now a gurdwara, and the former Soldier's Institute and Sunday School of 1890, now in use as a langar. The site is partly surrounded by a brick wall with fences, some of which are decorated with Sikh symbols. On the south-west corner of the premises a tall, ornamented flagpole has been placed with a Nishan Sahib, the Sikh triangular flag.  The main building  Main hall from the south The main church hall was finished in 1816 and is a Grade II-listed building since 1973 (English Heritage Building ID: 200246).Woolwich Methodist Church, Greenwich on britishlistedbuildings.co.uk. The architect is not known, although it is likely to have been designed by the Rev. William Jenkins, who is responsible for at least eleven Methodist chapels in the early 1800s, all clearly inspired by Wesley's Chapel of 1778 in City Road. The Woolwich chapel was an enlarged version of the Wesleyan chapel in Rochester, Kent, a Jenkins design. It measures 16 by 22 m (52x71 ft). The Wellington Street fa√ßade has five bays and two floors with nine round-headed windows. The centrally placed main entrance is accentuated by a prostyle portico. The three central bays project slightly and are crowned by a pediment. On the parapet below the pediment a stone plaque with the inscription The Methodist Chapel, 1816 is now covered up by a wooden sign with the text ‡®ó‡©Å‡®∞‡®¶‡©Å‡®Ü‡®∞‡®æ ‡®∏‡®æ‡®π‡®ø‡®¨ ‡®µ‡©Ç‡®≤‡®ø‡®ö - Gurdwara Sahib Woolwich. The west and east walls are plain brick with ten windows each. At the north end of the building is a small apse and the former vestry. The plainness of the interior of this type of Methodist chapel with its flat ceiling has been described as barn-like. In the main seating on the ground floor rows of pews faced the pulpit. Additional seating areas were created on the galleries situated around a large oval opening through which the pulpit could be seen. Unusual in a Methodist church of this type is the presence of burial vaults underneath, \\"in case another Death should happen in the Preacher's family\\". The two main floors of the building are currently used as Darbar Sahib Halls, the lower and upper prayer hall, containing the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scriptures. The main alterations for Sikh worship have been the removal of the pews and the insertion of a fixed floor where the galleries had been.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 295-296.  The annex building  Annex building from the south east The annex building was built in 1889‚Äì90 after a design by local architect Walter Whincop. It is described in Volume 44 of the Survey of London as \\"the last of a locally distinctive type to survive in Woolwich\\". Unlike the adjacent church hall it is not a listed building. The main fa√ßade on Calderwood Street, now painted white, consists of three bays and three storeys (including the basement). It is flanked by two single-storey porches. The western entrance was for the children attending Sunday school, the eastern entrance was for the soldiers. The original west doors were replaced by ornamental doors of wood and bronze made in Rajasthan. In the basement were baths and a caf√© for the military men, on the ground floor their reading room and a meeting room, on the top floor was the Sunday school. The building's main use currently is that of a langar hall (a communal refectory serving vegetarian food) with a kitchen. On the top floor are meeting rooms, a library, Granthi quarters and offices. The basement is used for various functions and serves as a Saturday school for pupils 5‚Äì18 years old, the Guru Nanak Khalsa School Greenwich.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 295-297.Layout of the Gurdwara and Guru Nanak Khalsa School Greenwich on woolwichgurdwara.org.uk.

Political History During Youssef Wahba‚Äôs first term as Prime Minister, Ibrahim was appointed Minister of Education and served from November 20, 1919 to May 21, 1920. He held the post of Minister of Education again during Tawfik Nasseem‚Äôs second term from November 30th, 1922 to February 9th, 1923. As Minister, he focused on eradicating the illiteracy of workers in several districts throughout the country. He was appointed Prime Minister on March 15th, 1923, and served until January 27th, 1924, where he continued to work as the Minister of Education. In addition to this, he became the Minister of Justice on November 18th, 1923. During his tenure as Prime Minister, he was known for his judiciousness and was given the nickname Sheikh Al Qadaa, or Chief of Judges. His time as Prime Minister was known as the ‚ÄúMinistry of Law‚Äù because of his simple and straight forward programme of putting the Constitution in force says Sir William Hayter in his book Recent Constitutional Developments In Egypt. The most important accomplishments of his reign include: the release of Saad Zaghlol after only serving as Prime Minister two weeks, the release of detainees in Egypt, the release of members of the Wafd Party and others exiled to Seychelles, several laws that he had annulled, and the issuance of the constitution on April 19, 1923. Another important accomplishment was the modification of the elections law and the introduction of greater transparency within the elections process. During his tenure as Prime Minister and with the return of Saad Zaghloul Pasha from exile the Zagloulists won elections obtaining almost all seats of the parliament. On January 17, 1924 Ibrahim submitted his resignation from his post as Prime Minister stating that he would have liked to stay long enough to also supervise the Senate election but the people of Egypt have spoken and their will should be respected. This loss reinforced the idea that the elections under his reign were fair and free. After ten days of hesitation, King Fouad accepted the Cabinet resignation, Egypt Chronicles.com. He became the first President of the Hizb Al Etihad or the ‚ÄúUnion Party‚Äù, which was established to support the palace in 1925, and was also appointed as the head of the Senate in 1925 and Minister of Finance in Ziwar Pasha term as Prime Minister.

Early life and education The daughter of artist Jill Hosmer, Noble was born in Waco, Texas, and grew up in the City Heights neighborhood of San Diego, moving there in 1982 at the age of 9. Her youth in City Heights has been described as \\"dependent on welfare, captivated by hip-hop and dance music, among racially diverse neighbors.\\" She earned a BA in philosophy from the University of California at San Diego in 2002, and an MFA in sound art at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2007. Career As a house music disc jockey, Noble performed at underground clubs internationally and in Chicago, Illinois, where she spent five years as a DJ. In 2007, she moved to San Diego to teach media production at High Tech High School in Point Loma while continuing her sound art practice. She collaborated in 2011 with math teacher David Stahnke in the \\"Illuminated Mathematics\\" project, winning second place in knowledge building and critical thinking, among twelve educators who represented the U.S. at Microsoft's Global Learning Forum. They went on to win first place in \\"Knowledge Building and Critical Thinking\\" category of the Global Forum Educator Awards. Frakture (2009-10) Noble's Frakture, a remix of a 1953 vinyl recording of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, is an \\"eight- track audio collage of analog synthesizer, acoustic drums, recordings of healthcare protests, contemporary political propaganda, emergency alarms, the New York Stock Exchange, dice rolling\\" and other sounds. On the recording, Noble reads excerpts from the text of the novel. Sound art and installations (2012-present) What Lies Beneath, by Margaret Noble Noble's installation 44th and Landis opened in 2012 at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego. The large-scale multimedia art piece combined Victorian-style paper dolls with 1980s urban influences based on her upbringing in San Diego's City Heights neighborhood, and included a performance by Noble. The show's visual centerpiece was a hanging series of 100 paper dolls, along with paper-doll clothing, objects and architecture. In her 2016 interactive piece \\"What Lies Beneath\\", she worked in sound sculpture, creating a tall wooden box with instructions next to it to raise the lid, which caused sounds of organ pipes, truck brakes and other dissonance to emit. The person interacting with it controlled the sound with the lid, with a \\"storm\\" inside the box. I Long to Be Free from Longing, by Margaret Noble Her \\"Head in the Sand\\" is a wooden box sitting on four legs with a head-sized hole in the top and instructions to visitors to place their heads in the hole and wait. Inside is a chambered light and sound show with soft pastoral sounds, the hole serving as a sanctuary from the art exhibit itself. \\"Head in the Sand\\" was included in her 2016 exhibition Resonating Object, an interactive mixture of sound, sculpture and videos, at South Puget Sound Community College in Olympia, Washington. The exhibition also included \\"I Long to Be Free From Longing\\" and \\"Material Shrine for the New Class\\", featuring dangling objects the visitor could squeeze to activate different sounds. Her 2014 interactive sound installation \\"I Long to Be Free From Longing\\" won first place in the 23rd annual Juried Exhibition at the Athenaeum Music & Arts Library in San Diego. Noble's 2016 sound art installation Time Strata, a public art commission for the Port of San Diego at the Cesar Chavez Park pier, consisted of three sound sculptures made of materials including vintage buoys, hunks of bamboo, bells, stainless steel and harp strings, along with sounds of creatures like snapping shrimp in the water under the pier. Microphones placed around the pier fed the sound into a mixer and then into four digital consoles where participants could sample and alter the sounds. I Have Arrived, by Margaret NobleFor The Collector, Noble worked with puppeteers Animal Cracker Conspiracy and visual directors Bridget Rountree and Iain Gunn, creating a multi-layered soundscape that used animated video, live video projection and puppetry to tell a story of a debt collector. Righteous Exploits, a 2013 experimental performance created with Justin Hudnall, used a combination of live audio and video multimedia and performance art. Her 2018 installations of Resonating Objects included \\"lawn sprinklers sitting on grass-covered pedestals, playing their percussive, shimmering, water-spraying sounds\\", entitled \\"I Have Arrived\\", which explores the use of expendable resources on lawns, or status symbols. A Shit Pile of Lights and Sounds for Your Pleasure, by Margaret NobleTwo other pieces are \\"Scaled Discords, 2015\\", with spinning tops representing \\"power structures, resource allocation and racial inequality in America\\", and \\"A Shit Pile of Lights and Sounds for Your Pleasure\\" consisting of \\"mash-up of Lite Brite, a Ouija board, and an early Akai sampler\\".  Critical reception  Noble's art has been presented on PBS and reviewed favorably in Art Ltd. Magazine, The San Diego Union-Tribune, and San Francisco Weekly. Thomas Larson of the San Diego Reader wrote that \\"enlarging the sensorium of art with sound begins with disorder,\\" but while visual art may be viewed with \\"one or one hundred other hushed-up viewers,\\" sound art is more like \\"a Fourth-of-July picnic, Charles-Ives polyphony, a resolute disequilibrium\\".Now Is Not a Good Time, by Margaret Noble Reviewing her exhibit titled, \\"Now Is Not A Good Time\\", Rebecca Romani of The Buzz wrote in 2018 of its \\"intriguing mix\\" of sewing and tatting materials and rattlesnake tails powered by tiny batteries. Romani commented, \\"It's tempting to read a cautionary tale of watching too much Little House On The Prairie and the nostalgia that lead us to these current times.\\" Reviewer Michael James Rocha said in 2016, \\"Artist Margaret Noble isn't afraid to push the boundaries of what's art.\\" Observing Frakture, Jennie Punter of Musicworks wrote of Noble's \\"underground club DJ‚Äôs flair for performance and a conceptual artist's commitment to the rigorous investigation of ideas\\". Mark Jenkins of The Washington Post wrote, \\"Her primary goal is audience participation, whether that involves turning a crank or inserting one's head into a box to prompt whooshing sounds. Noble's work completes its circuit when the spectator is, literally or figuratively, inside it.\\" Of the exhibit 44th and Landis, Angela Carone of Public Radio International commented, \\"Look close and you'll see the ghosts of Ms. Pac-Man, the labels from Animal Cracker boxes and Laffy Taffy, and, on the seedier side, signage from neighborhood massage parlors. The paper dolls are pint-sized mash-ups of '80s pop culture and Victoriana. They seem to emerge from Noble's childhood dreams as she tried to make sense of both a threatening and exciting environment.\\" Drew Snyder noted, \\"...there is an excess to the sound collage, a soft but persistent drone of spinning bottles or coins, rolling glass marbles, the eternal creak of a cabinet hinge, the rapt knocking on a door, or the sound of something falling over. These reverberations are strikingly material, a confluence and collision of metal, plastic, wood and glass that mash up and reconfigure what we can imagine as a neighborhood's aural life.\\" Discography=Albums * Frakture (2010, self-released on CD and vinyl) Compilations * \\"Nufon\\", from Female Pressure (2008, Austrian DVD release) * \\"Safer is Better\\", from Musicworks #118 Spring 2014 (2014, CD) Solo exhibitions * 44th and Landis, Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, 2012 * Touch, Ohrenhoch der Ger√§uschladen Sound Gallery, Berlin, Germany, 2014 * Dorian's Gray, Roswell Museum and Art Center, Roswell, NM, 2015 * Resonating Objects, Institute of Contemporary Art, San Jose, CA, 2015 * Interactivity: Sight and Sound, Cafritz Foundation Arts Center, Montgomery, MD, 2015 * Resonating Objects, Kenneth J.

His league and championship career with the Galway senior team spanned thirteen seasons from 1976 until 1989. He played his club football with Milltown. McManus won his first All-Ireland medal as a part of the Galway Minor team that beat Cork in the 1976 final. He followed this with a Sigerson Cup win with UCG in 1979/80. He won the university title again the following year in 1980/81 as Captain, as well as finishing as Top Scorer and winning the Player of The Tournament Award. McManus joined the Galway senior team during the 1976/77 National League campaign, making his Championship debut in 1977, aged 19. He won a National Football League with Galway in 1981, scoring a goal in the final. McManus was also a part of the Galway team that were beaten by Dublin in the 1983 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final. Inter- County Career=Minor and Under-21 Gay McManus began his football career with Galway playing at full-forward for the Minor team who were defeated in the Connacht final of 1975. He was still eligible for the minor grade the following year, playing an integral role in helping Galway to go all the way to winning Connacht and All-Ireland minor glory, defeating Cork in the All- Ireland final on a scoreline of 1-10 to 0-6. McManus' next underage success with Galway came with the Under-21 team in 1979. McManus was the difference for Galway that day scoring 0-7 from full-forward as Galway defeated Sligo 0-12 to 0-9. Galway would be defeated by eventual champions Down in the All- Ireland semi-final. Senior McManus made his senior debut for Galway in the 1976/77 season of the National Football League, just off the back of his All-Ireland Minor success. In 1977, he made his championship debut aged just 19 as Galway would go as far as the Connacht final. Despite McManus doing well for Galway on the frees, they were narrowly beaten by Roscommon on a scoreline of 1-12 to 2-08. Mcmanus and Galway would fall short to Roscommon again the following year on a scoreline of 2-07 to 0-09. Galway wouldn't reach the Connacht final again for another 4 years. McManus won his first piece of silverware with the Galway senior team following victory over Roscommon in the 1980/81 National Football League Final, Galway running out victors 1-11 to 1-03, McManus providing a great goal for Galway. 1982 saw McManus take the helm of the Galway captaincy after he and his club, Milltown won the 1981 Galway Senior Football Championship. McManus would go on to lead Galway to their first Connacht title win in six years as Galway defeated Mayo 3-17 to 0-10. Galway were defeated by eventual champions Offaly in the All-Ireland Semi-Final. In 1983, Galway retained their Connacht crown, beating Mayo in the final 1-13 to 1-10. Galway would go on to play Dublin in the 1983 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, the infamous 'Game of Shame'. Galway had one player dismissed, as Dublin had three more. Amazingly, Dublin's 'Dirty Dozen' managed to hold off Galway's attack and win the ill-tempered game 1-10 to 1-08. The game would go down in history as one the most memorable All- Ireland finals. Galway would bounce back from their All-Ireland defeat of 1983, going on to reach the final of the 1983/84 NFL, but would fall short to Kerry 1-11 to 0-11. The Tribesmen would make it three Connacht titles in a row in 1984, overcoming Mayo in the final, 2-13 to 2-09. In the All-Ireland semi- final, they would face Kerry again and unfortunately would lose again to the eventual All-Ireland champions. Galway failed to reach the Connacht final in 1985 but would make up for it in 1986, going all the way to beat Roscommon 1-08 to 1-05 in the final. Unfortunately, Galway would bow out at the semi- final stage once again, this time to Tyrone 1-12 to 1-09. Galway won the Connacht championship in 1987 by the smallest of margins, beating Mayo 0-08 to 0-07. In the All-Ireland semi final Galway were minutes away from winning as they led against Cork by a point. However a converted Larry Tompkins free-kick outside the forty-five meant that the sides would have to meet again. Unfortunately, it wasn't Galway's day in the replay as they were simply outclassed by Cork, 0-18 to 1-04. After Galway failed to reach Connacht finals in 1988 and 1989, it was now high time for McManus to finish up his career after thirteen seasons. Gay McManus was an integral part of Galway's dominance in Connacht in the 1980s. From captaining the side in 1982 to leading from the front as Galway's top scorer on many occasions, he is undeniably one of the best forwards of that era. In 2020, he was selected as one of the twenty greatest Galway players of the last fifty years by the Irish Independent. Club Gay McManus made his senior championship debut for the Milltown senior team as a sixteen year old in 1974. He would play championship football for Milltown for twenty years before retiring in 1994. In that time, he would play in four county finals in 1978, 1981, 1986 and 1987. Unfortunately, Milltown only won one of them four county finals, in 1981. On that day they defeated St. Grellan's, Ballinasloe 0-11 to 2-3. In a man of the match performance, McManus scored nine of Milltown's eleven points.

In 1752 the alms house was sold by his descendant Edmond Shee. The family were dispossessed during the Cromwellian period. However they regained control and power in the 18th century. Sir Nicholas Power O'Shee of Gardenmorris, Co. Waterford took back ownership of the house in 1756 and it operated as an almshouse until 1830. The house was also used as a Catholic chapel before the 1800s and as a hospital in 1837. It became a shop in the early 20th century. The Alms house was in 1978 acquired by Kilkenny Corporation and restored to its original condition. It was reopened as the city tourist office in 1981 The building is a terraced two-bay two-storey gable-fronted rubble stone house, with cut- limestone features, and a half-dormer attic.

Plot  Warren, an alcoholic drifter, learns from a phone call that an ex-girlfriend has died and he has a son in Mexico. Warren writes down the caller's number before travelling to sell Bo Dawg and his associate methamphetamine. Bo Dawg's associate accidentally shoots himself. Warren shoots Bo Dawg dead and flees, pursued by Cal and Robbie. Warren, after failed attempts to contact the caller, stops at Bedford Flats, an isolated town deep in the American desert near the Mexican border. Warren meets the local liquor store owner Don and local drunk Bob, who is warned that the town is sick of his behavior. Warren attends a sobriety meeting held by Steve Patterson. After the meeting, Steve offers to help Warren become sober. Returning to his motel room, Warren discovers Cal and Robbie have tracked him down. Warren seeks shelter with Steve and his wife Cheryl. Warren takes a horse tranquilizer he finds planted in Steve and Cheryl's bathroom to ease his withdrawal and passes out. When he awakens, Warren is tied up in the middle of the desert along with Cal, Robbie, Bob and another man, Jim. Sheriff Burnside ignores Bob's pleading and announces the town's annual hunt, where armed townsfolk will hunt and kill the captives. Burnside introduce the hunters, including Steve and Cheryl, Don, and a trio of siblings, Charley, Jessie, and Mickey Wakowski. Burnside frees the captives, who flee through the desert. After a few miles of running, Jim falls over in exhaustion. Warren leaves him the rest of the tranquilizers to ease his suffering. After running several miles further, Bob says he knows what they must do to survive. He knocks Cal unconscious with a rock, forcing Warren and Robbie to flee in different directions. Soon after, the hunters set off to find the men. The Wakowski siblings shoot Jim with an arrow and run him over with a car. When they reach Bob and Cal, Bob attempts to exchange Cal for his survival. Don kills both Cal and Bob with a long range rifle. Steve and Cheryl ambush Warren, attempting to hit him with their car. Steve accidentally crashes, knocking himself unconscious and killing Cheryl. Warren grabs a gun and a map from the car. When Don arrives, he flees. As night falls, Warren succumbs to his alcohol withdrawal and hallucinates. After bumping into Robbie, the pair discover a service hut, and Warren filters ethanol out of various supplies. Warren contacts a man on a radio and requests help; however, it is revealed to be the Wakowskis. They shoot Robbie through a window, killing him instantly. When the Wakowskis enter the hut, Warren shoots Charley with an arrow through the neck, shoots Mickey multiple times with a gun, and kills Jessie with an axe. Continuing his hike through the desert, Warren finds a group of Mexicans sneaking into the US and realizes they are tying red ribbons as they go. Warren steps on a bear trap, rendering him immobile. Don catches up to Warren and stabs him, but Warren shoots Don dead. Meanwhile, Steve awakens in Bedford Flats, taken back to receive medical help. Upon learning that Cheryl has died, Steve becomes enraged, murders a townsperson and leaves to locate Warren. Burnside and his son, Junior, set out to help Steve. Burnside explains to Junior that Steve was once a captive in the hunt but escaped, bettered his life, and became sober. Despite Burnside's belief that Steve is a changed man, Steve shoots Junior through the head and beats Burnside to death with a baseball bat. At night, Warren hallucinates Bo Dawg urging him to take his own life. Warren refuses and frees himself from the bear trap. At the American‚ÄìMexican border, he discovers a red ribbon leading to an underground passageway. While traveling through it, Steve attacks Warren. Warren eventually sets Steve on fire with a lighter and a bottle of tequila. Warren reaches the Mexican side of the tunnel and checks his phone for service. As he gets service, he is suddenly shot through the neck by a Mexican gang member. As the gang approach Warren, he laughs.

It opened in 2013 on the old site of South Chadderton School. The school had 4 year groups (Year 7, 8, 9 and 10). The school had around 210 students.  History  Collective Spirit Free School was opened in September 2013 on the old site of South Chadderton School which joined with Kaskenmoor School to create Oasis Academy Oldham in 2012. The opening of the school was controversial due to it being the first Free school in the Borough of Oldham to be opened. The school was given the green light in 2012 and opened in September 2013 with 50 Year 7 students. The opening was controversial due to the land that the school is situated on is prime development land and is worth ¬£1.1 million. Many people thought that 'giving' the school the land was a lost opportunity to sell the land to a developer. In May 2016, Collective Spirit Free School had its first Ofsted inspection. The school was rated inadequate in all areas and there were even calls by local MP Jim McMahon to close down the school and send students to other mainstream secondary schools in the area. As a result of this, the school closed in July 2017.  Ofsted  Collective Spirit Free School came under heavy controversy because it was the first free school to be opened in the borough of Oldham. In June 2016, the Ofsted report for the school was released, and it was rated inadequate which is the lowest grade a school can receive. Local MP Jim McMahon pleaded for the school to be closed saying that students weren't being given an acceptable standard of education and that students felt unsafe due to bullying and fighting, also adding that the school didn't even have a library. He went on to say it was one of the 'most damming' Ofsted reports he's ever seen.

As of 2016, about one-and-a-half million Po√§ngs are sold annually, and a total of 30 million have been produced.PO√ÑNG: 40 Years of Comfort and Style POSTED BY IKEA USA ON SEPTEMBER 01, 2016 The Japanese designer, Noboru Nakamura, created the chair in 1976 in collaboration with product manager Lars Engman. Its design resembles that of the \\"Armchair 406,\\" created by the Finnish designer Alvar Aalto in 1939, but it features thin upholstery instead of the 406's webbed seat. Its molded plywood frame swings slightly when a person sits in it, giving the impression of a rocking chair; Nakamura intended this to evoke a relaxing feeling. The design of the chair has been changed several times since its introduction. Initially named \\"Poem,\\" it was renamed to \\"Po√§ng\\" in 1992, and the seat part was changed from tubular steel to wood, which allowed the chair to be flat-packed and led to a price reduction of 21%. The color, pattern, and material of the upholstery were also repeatedly changed to account for changing customer preferences. The Po√§ng's price has decreased markedly since its introduction. In the 1990s it sold for up to $350 in the U.S. (adjusted for inflation as of 2016) compared to a 2016 price of $79. In its post-1990s form, the Po√§ng is composed of a frame of bent, glued beechwood veneers and solid wooden rails, finished with clear lacquer and available in various colors. The seating material consists of polypropylene support fabric and cushions made of leather or fabric filled with polyurethane foam. A matching ottoman footstool is also sold. Ingvar Kamprad, the founder of IKEA, expressed an affinity for the Po√§ng, and said in 2006 that he had owned the same one for 32 years.1974 IKEA chair, one careful owner, not for sale Luke Harding for The Guardian Wednesday 20 December 2006 References Category:IKEA Category:Chairs Category:Products introduced in 1976 Category:Individual models of furniture ","title":"Po√§ng"},{"id":"52076542","text":"Colette Libourel (born 26 December 1940) is a French former swimmer.

Early life Stanback was born in Salisbury, North Carolina on December 15, 1958. Her father was a businessman, and her mother was a teacher and also a journalist. Both of Anne's parents were active in the Civil Rights Movement, which instilled Anne with the importance of activism even at a very early age. She attended Davidson College, and graduated from there in 1981. She then went on to attend the Yale Divinity School. Career and activism Stanback's activism is strongly informed by her faith, which she melded with feminist theologies and social justice issues. In Connecticut, Stanback co-chaired the Connecticut Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights, and helped pass the Connecticut Gay Rights Statute in 1991. That statute prohibited discrimination towards LGBT people in housing, employment, credit, and public accommodations. In 1991, she became Executive Director of the National Abortion Rights Action League's Connecticut chapter. In 1993, she became the Executive Director of the Connecticut Women's Education and Legal Fund, wherein she also advocated for Title IX and focused on the disparate support given to men and women's teams. In 1999, Stanback was the founding Executive Director of Love Makes A Family, an organization based in Connecticut. The organization was formed in response to a court ruling that denied adoption rights to a lesbian couple, and the organization successfully advocated for adoption laws to protect the rights of same-sex couples in Connecticut. Because of their advocacy, Connecticut became the first state in the United States to pass a law that recognized second-parent adoption without the action of a previous court. After their victory, Love Makes A Family shifted their focus to that of marriage equality. In 2008 the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to deny LGBT couples the right to marry, and in 2009 the Connecticut General Assembly made that ruling into state law. After that historic win, Love Makes A Family shut down. Stanback is now the Director of Strategic Partnerships for the Equality Federation, wherein she works to pass state-level laws to protect LGBT people from employment and housing discrimination. Since 2008, she also is on the boards of Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) and Freedom for All Americans. Honors Stanback has received numerous honors for her work.

The representatives before the National Strike Council were elected or revoked by the struggle committees of each school through the holding of plenary assemblies. It was initially established three representatives per school on strike but then with the increase of the same was reduced two. In the local assemblies of the schools agreements were reached that were taken to the plenary of the Council, then the decisions taken in the Council were taken to the assemblies of each school to be ratified and put into operation. Decisions in the National Strike Council were taken by simple majority and were followed by all delegates.Ontiveros, Rivas O., Ren√©.

History  The mine was named after Baron Hatherton who had assumed the surname Littleton in 1812. First workings at the mine, however, were conducted by the Cannock and Huntingdon Colliery Company in 1877. Upon sinking the first \\"No. 1\\" shaft they encountered water at a depth of 438 ft (133 metres) and the shaft became flooded. Lord Hatherton who owned the land on which the colliery was constructed sunk the \\"No. 2\\" shaft in 1899 which was completed to a depth of 1,622 ft (494 metres). In the 1960s the colliery was modernised and equipped with skip winding. After this, production regularly surpassed 1,000,000 tons in a year. The colliery closed in 1993 following the overturning of a reprieve granted a year earlier. The colliery has now been completely demolished and the old site is shared between Littleton Green Community School and a housing development.

In 1935, the Burmese ruby was purchased by Howard Hoeffer of jeweler Trabert & Hoeffer-Mauboussin, whereupon it was used in several Hollywood films in the 1930s, including the musical comedy Vogues of 1938. Trabert & Hoeffer-Mauboussin sold the jewel on September 14, 2004. Description The 83-carat Star of Burma is a cabochon- cut star ruby with a pigeon-blood color. The color, common to Burmese rubies, is among the most coveted of ruby colors. The jewel's setting was never signed. An advertisement for the jeweler in the 1935 issue of Vogue depicted the ruby as mounted in a platinum pendant or brooch, surrounded by diamonds, and described that \\"in all the world there is not another like it\\". History The ruby came from a mine in Burma, present-day Myanmar. At the time, Burmese rubies were considered the finest in the world. Trabert & Hoeffer had formed a working partnership with the French jeweler Mauboussin from 1935 to 1953; this partnership allowed Trabert & Hoeffer access to European jewels. Around this time, the Netherlands' House of Orange-Nassau quietly sold numerous gems to jewelers including Trabert & Hoeffer-Mauboussin, including the Star of Burma, to Howard Hoeffer of Trabert & Hoeffer-Mauboussin in 1935. At a diamond fashion show and preview of the film Rhodes of Africa in 1936, Mary Lewis wore the Star of Burma set in a necklace's pendant, which also contained 6,000 diamonds and 150 rubies. The 1937 film Vogues of 1938 showcased costumes using name brands, including clothes by Omar Kiam, designer furs by Jaeckel, shoes by I. Miller & Sons, handbags and hats by John Fredericks and Sally Victor, and jewels by Trabert & Hoeffer-Mauboussin. The title sequence was of Joan Bennett's gloved hand wearing a diamond and platinum bracelet with the Star of Burma, pulling open curtains to reveal the opening credits. The gem was also worn in the 1937 film Hollywood Hotel, and as a pendant from a ruby and diamond necklace by Tamara Geva in the 1937 film Manhattan Merry-Go-Round. The Jewels of Trabert & Hoeffer-Mauboussin, published in 2014, describes that the jeweler's most valuable gems, including the Star of Burma, were lent and sometimes sold after Howard Hoeffer established stores in resort communities in the late 1930s. The jewel was sold at fine art and jewelry auctioneer Doyle New York, at a September 14, 2004 auction, where the jewel was the primary highlight of the event.

It is almost always done with specially bred dogs called coonhounds, of which there are six breeds, and is most commonly associated with rural life in the Southern United States. Coon hunting is also popular in the rural Midwest. Most coon hunts take place at night, with the dogs being turned loose, trailing and putting the raccoon up a tree without human assistance. Once the raccoon is in the tree, with the dog at the base, it is referred to as \\"treed\\", with \\"treeing\\" being the active verb form. In addition to meat or fur hunts, there are also competition hunts to demonstrate the speed and skill of the dog. In these the raccoons are not killed, but are treed and released. Some of the largest competition hunts are the Grand American, Autumn Oaks, and Leafy Oaks. Coon hunting has been recorded in such books as Where the Red Fern Grows and popularized in stories and songs recorded by Jerry Clower, Jimmy Martin and others. In Alabama, there is a cemetery specifically for the burial of coon dogs. Training Coonhound puppies typically start their hunting training at less than six months of age. The dog's owner or trainer will begin by teaching it to follow the scent of a raccoon's pelt or commercial scent stick dragged across the ground. A Treeing Walker Coonhound puppy After the young dog has mastered this, it is taken hunting, either by itself or with other dogs. Many dog trainers prefer hunting older dogs alongside a younger one, with the reasoning that they will set an example for the inexperienced dog. Experienced dog trainers note that the most difficult part is often not teaching the dog to hunt raccoons but teaching it to ignore other animals such as opossums, whitetail deer and rabbits, which are colloquially called \\"trash\\". Practice Modern coon hunting is practiced with the use of a trained dog or pigs. While historically coon hunting dogs were of any breed, modern coon dogs are almost always members of the scenthound subgroup called coonhounds. There are six distinct breeds of coonhound developed specifically to hunt climbing game by scent; Black and Tan Coonhound, Redbone Coonhound, Bluetick Coonhound, English Coonhound, Treeing Walker Coonhound, and Plott Hound. The breeds vary somewhat in size, though color is the largest obvious difference. All but the Plott Hound descend from the English Coonhound. A major difference in hunting performance is whether a dog is hot-nosed, meaning it will skip an older scent to follow a fresher one, or cold-nosed, meaning it will follow an older scent. Of the six coonhound breeds, the hot-nosed Treeing Walker Coonhound is the most popular. Some hunters also use Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dogs, although this breed is not a hound but a cur. A Redbone Coonhound treeing a raccoon at night The dog or dogs are released at night in an area where raccoons are likely to be, such as a forest, crop field or swamp, and allowed to find a raccoon scent. Most dogs will emit a long, distinct bay upon striking a trail, and will continue to bay the entire time they are tracking the raccoon. The dog's voice may change timbre depending on how fresh or \\"hot\\" a scent is. Unlike some breeds of hunting dog that use sight to locate their prey, coonhounds use their sense of smell alone. The hunt typically ends when the raccoon climbs a tree. Upon reaching the tree, the dog or dogs will stop baying and begin the \\"tree\\" bark, also referred to as the chop bark for its short, sharp sound. This change in vocalization lets the hunter know when a raccoon is treed. Some dogs have emitted as many as 150 chop barks per minute when on a tree. The dog is thus said to be treeing, and the raccoon is considered treed. The human hunter may either follow the dog as it hunts, or remain in one place and only go after the dog once it has treed. Tracking collars with built-in global positioning systems may be used to help locate the dog, though historically the dog's voice was used as a locator. Following the dog to the tree is often done on foot, although some hunters use mules or horses, and some utilize all-terrain vehicles. Horses and mules used for coon hunting typically are able to jump fences \\"flat-footed\\" or from a standstill. The hunter dismounts for this procedure, unlike traditional British fox hunting in which part of the sport involves jumping fences at speed. This method has led to a mule show competition called coon jumping. Regardless of how they choose to travel, hunters typically wear a headlight in order to allow free use of both hands, though years ago flashlights or lanterns were more common. The first coon hunting headlights were carbide lights similar to those used by coal miners, but today headlights are made and sold specifically for hunting. A .22 rifle is the preferred caliber of gun, and boots are highly recommended due to mud and rough terrain. The Bluetick Coonhound is one of six breeds of scenthound specifically bred to hunt raccoons Not all coon hunting is in the wild, as many modern hunters enter their dogs in competition hunts, also called nite hunts. In 2002 the United Kennel Club (UKC), the largest registry for coonhounds, sanctioned over 6,000 such hunts across the United States. The largest and most prestigious annual hunts, also called field trials, include the Autumn Oaks, Leafy Oaks, and Coonhunting World Championship. All are licensed UKC events. The Autumn Oaks is held in Richmond, Indiana and attracts competitors from 39 states and Canada. Another large annual hunt is the Grand American Coon Hunt, which has been held in Orangeburg, South Carolina since 1965 and is sanctioned by the American Coon Hunters' Association. It includes a popular bench or conformation show in addition to the hunting competition, and has special events for children who hunt or own coonhounds. In addition to the larger all-breed hunts, the UKC also holds a number of nite hunts each year that are breed-specific, meaning that they are limited to dogs of only one breed. The Southeastern Treeing Walker Conference is an example of this. The American Kennel Club and other kennel clubs also sanction coon hunting competitions. While killing raccoons is legal during the hunting season, typically September to February, some hunters merely tree the raccoon and then leave it unharmed. In competitive hunts, where the objective is to demonstrate the skill of the dog, killing or harming the raccoon will often result in disqualification. Hunting for the sport without killing the raccoon, which is equated to catch and release fishing, or chasing raccoons from crop fields is legal year-round. Regulations As with all game animals in the United States, the hunting of raccoons is regulated by wildlife conservation officials in each state and seasons and bag limits will therefore vary. In Tennessee, for example, coon hunting season begins in mid-September and ends in February, with a bag limit of one raccoon per hunter per day, while in Kentucky, it begins in October and ends on the last day of February, with no bag limit. Some states, including Iowa, require a valid trapping or hunting license to train a coonhound to hunt. Inadvertent hunting or running of deer by coonhounds is particularly problematic for hunters, as hunting deer with dogs is illegal in most states. History Raccoons were first hunted by Native Americans, who harvested the common animals both for meat and fur. British and European settlers in North America later adopted the practice. While Native hunters did not rely on dogs, white hunters utilized them from Colonial times; George Washington is credited with owning some of the first coon hunting dogs, French hounds given to him by the Marquis de Lafayette. Most of the early coon dogs were actually Foxhounds imported from Europe or mixed breeds with hound blood, but these dogs often had trouble finding raccoons when the latter climbed trees, and breeders began to specifically develop dogs for their treeing ability: the ability to follow the scent to the base of a tree and stay there until the hunter came. A pair of raccoons in a maple tree Coonhounds existed as a distinct type by the mid-to-late 1800s. By 1885 a raccoon pelt sold for approximately 25 cents, a fair price for the time. Up to World War I raccoons were very common despite being hunted often, and were sometimes poisoned to keep them from destroying crops. Raccoon fur car coats were a fashion trend in the 1920s, leading to high pelt prices and an increase in hunting and trapping. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, when many rural families lived in poverty, raccoons were hunted extensively and became relatively rare. Hunters sold the pelts for needed money, and the meat provided protein. In the 1940s and '50s conservation efforts were undertaken, including teaching hunters not to cut down den trees that raccoons used for raising offspring. The raccoon population subsequently expanded, to the point that they became recognized as a least-concern species. During the 1950s, staged nite hunts were created and by the 1970s had become popular with some hunts involving over one thousand dogs. In the 1970s, the price of raccoon pelts rose again to a high of 25 to 30 dollars each, and some people made their entire income from coon hunting. It was possible to catch ten raccoons per night in well-populated areas, with good dogs. One outdoors writer estimated that in 1985 there were 30 to 40 thousand coon hunters in Michigan alone. This market hunting largely died out by the late 1980s, and it is estimated that during the fur boom trapping took more raccoons than hunting with dogs. The practice of coon hunting is sometimes associated with possum hunting, since the same dogs were often used, the animals are both climbers by nature, and are common in the same geographic areas. However, opossums are criticized for being too easy to hunt and too greasy to be edible if killed, and are seldom hunted today. Coon hunting continues to be popular in the rural South and Midwest. The Indianapolis Star noted in a 2014 article that while some coon hunters are \\"overalls-clad people from the backwoods\\", some earn six-figure salaries, and a top coonhound can cost as much as $40,000. Media and culture Published in 1947, Fred Gipson's first novel, Hound-Dog Man, tells the story of two young boys on a coon hunt with a \\"hound dog man\\" in 1905 Texas. It was made into a 1959 film starring Fabian Forte and Stuart Whitman, but while the book was successful the movie was a flop. In 1961 Wilson Rawls published the novel Where the Red Fern Grows, the story of young coon hunter Billy Colman, who lives in the Oklahoma Ozark Mountains with his Redbone Coonhounds, Old Dan and Little Ann. The book was unsuccessfully marketed to adults for several years before being tested at schools, where it became a mainstay. A movie of the same name was made in 1974, starring Beverly Garland, Stewart Peterson and James Whitmore. It was remade in 2003. Southern comedian and folk storyteller Jerry Clower released his record of \\"The Coon Hunt\\", a comic tale of a Mississippi coon hunt gone wrong, in the early 1970s. It became popular almost immediately, launching Clower's career, and remained his best-known work, in addition to bringing over $1 million in sales and ultimately becoming a platinum record for MCA Records. Country and bluegrass musician Jimmy Martin coon hunted as a hobby and wrote and recorded several songs about his coonhounds. Two of his songs, \\"Pete, the Best Coon Dog in the State of Tennessee\\" and \\"Run Pete Run\\", which describe the exploits of a \\"half Black and Tan and half Walker\\" named Pete, became bluegrass hits. On the latter song, the voice of Martin's coonhound is actually heard. In addition to fictional portrayals of coon hunting, there are several magazines specifically devoted to the sport, of which two are Coonhound Bloodlines and Full Cry. Other The Key Underwood Coon Dog Memorial Graveyard is a cemetery located in Colbert County, Alabama. Since the 1930s it has been specifically dedicated to burial of coonhounds.

From 1965 to 1970 the houses were restored and given to elderly people of Kinsale. There are two parts to the structure.

The final line-up consisted of vocalist/instrumentalist Rey Osburn, guitarist Eric Stenman, drummer Matt McCord, and bassist Rick Verrett. They released three studio albums: Synaptic Hardware (1993), Hypersonic Hyperphonic (1996) and Tried + True (2000). History=Early years and indie releases (1992‚Äì2000) Tinfed was founded in Sacramento, California by Rey Osburn and Eric Stenman. Stenman and Osburn had previously performed together in the band Elegy, who had only released a 7\\" titled Dormant / Separated in 1990. Similar to that project, Tinfed's sound was heavily influenced by punk rock, industrial rock, and indie rock. The band released their debut, titled Synaptic Hardware, in 1993 on Primitech Releases. Mercado left the band shortly after the release and the band expanded to include bassist Nick Frederick and drummer/percussionist Matt McCord, the latter of whom had also been a former member of Elegy. Their second album was issued by electro-industrial label Re- Constriction Records on December 3, 1996 and was titled Hypersonic Hyperphonic. Sonic Boom noted that \\"Tinfed is one of those bands who would fit perfectly on tour with the likes of God Lives Underwater, Stabbing Westward, Filter & Gravity Kills which means they should do rather well with the current crossover audience.\\" In 2000, their song \\"Immune\\" was featured in the film Mission: Impossible 2 and appeared on its soundtrack. Major label years and break-up (2000‚Äì2003) The band signed to the major record label Hollywood Records and replaced Nick Frederick with Rick Verrett. Tinfed released their major-label debut Tried + True on August 22, 2000. Stanton Swihart of Allmusic gave the album a mixed review and criticized the band for sounding too derivative of Britpop groups such as Radiohead and Travis, saying \\"they ultimately fail to attain the same levels of esoteric complexity as those bands.\\" Swihart concluded his review saying the band's best material may be ahead of them: \\"While Tinfed is not unequivocally successful or innovative on a sonic level, it is frequently exciting and a terribly promising effort from a band that may eventually cast its own considerable shadow.\\" CMJ reviewed it more positively, calling Tried + True a \\"forward-thinking rock record with plenty of potential commercial appeal\\" that \\"contains pretty guitar pop enhanced only minimally by studio machinery.\\" \\"Dangergirl\\" featured a guest appearance by Chino Moreno, lead vocalist of Deftones. On March 4, 2003 the band released Designated Rivals, an album containing remixed and several previously unreleased tracks, on Attinuator Records. In July the members of Tinfed announced they had decided to turn their attention to separate projects, effectively ending the band. Rey Osburn formed the two bands Ghostride and Death Valley High, with Matt McCord also joining Death Valley High along with Osburn. Rick Verrett had joined Team Sleep in 2001 and appeared on their self-titled debut in 2005. Eric Stenman continued building his resume as a producer and recording engineer, working with bands such as AWOLNATION, Saves The Day, Will Haven, Senses Fail and Thrice.

He inherited and then owned a general store called \\"The Brazen Head.\\" The store was located in Cornhill, an area in the center of Boston. Because of his loyalty to the crown, Jackson made enemies with many patriotic Bostonians, and was the target of frequent intimidation by the Sons of Liberty.  Early life  Jackson was born in 1731. His mother, Mary, a widow, owned a general store located in Cornhill, MA in Boston named \\"The Brazen Head.\\" Jackson took after his mother; in 1758 the two were working side-by- side running the store. The Brazen Head A depiction of the Old State House, circa 1801. The Brazen Head was located nearby in the adjacent square. Originally owned by Mary Jackson, the Brazen Head was a general store located in Cornhill, an area in the heart of Boston. Located next to the Town House, otherwise known as the Old State House, the Brazen Head was most likely a well-known store. The Town House was an incredibly important building, and has been referred to as \\"The principle public building of the Provence [Massachusetts].\\" According to History of the Old State House by George Moore, \\"Washington, Lafayette, Franklin, Jefferson\\" and others joined important Massachusetts residents in visiting the Town House. It can be deduced, then, that the Brazen Head was an important and highly trafficked store due to its centrality within Boston and its location next to the Town House. A newspaper advertisement in a 1736 edition of the New England Weekly Journal also provided us with some insight on the Brazen Head's surroundings. The advertisement stated, \\"Several sorts of glass bottles, as also goods velvet corks, to be sold by Mr. Belthazar Bayard, next door to Brazen Head in Cornhil, Boston.\\" This indicates that the Brazen Head was not the only landmark in the area, and that Cornhill housed many different, important stores. A map of the area in Boston affected by the Great Boston Fire. The Town House is marked by a \\"C\\" in the top left of the map, the relative location of the Brazen Head and therefore the location of the start of the fire. The Jacksons relied heavily on imported goods their entire lives, and before the non-importation agreement it seems like they were well respected in the Boston community. An advertisement in the Boston Gazette from 1759 stated, \\"Imported from London and Bristol, and sold by Mary Jackson and Son at the Brazen Head, Cornhill, Boston: Brass kettles, skillets, warming pans, iron pots and kettles, powder, [etc]‚Ä¶ A wholesale customer may depend upon being well serv'd at a reasonable price.\\" The Brazen Head clearly sold a diverse array of goods, and according to the ad, the Jacksons could be counted upon as trustworthy vendors.  The Great Boston Fire  The Brazen Head, and the entire city of Boston for that matter, suffered a major setback in 1760. \\"The Great Boston Fire\\" broke out on March 17 and 18. It raged on for two days, destroyed 349 buildings and left over 1,000 people homeless. According to a newspaper article in the Boston Evening Post, \\"[The fire] began about two o'clock in the morning, in the dwelling house of Mrs. Mary Jackson and Son, and the brazen head in Cornhill, but the accident which occasioned it is yet uncertain. The flames catch'd the houses adjoining in the front of the street, and burn four large buildings before a stop could be put to it there.\\" The fire was obviously devastating, but the Jacksons rebounded quickly. As seen in Jackson's biography from the Massachusetts Historical Society, the shop was reopened in 1763, run now exclusively by William. Nonimportation agreement In 1767, the merchants of Boston signed a nonimportation agreement in response to the Townshend Acts. The aim was to pressure Great Britain into withdrawing what they saw as punitive taxation legislation. Author Richard Archer described the committee that drew up this agreement, which included John Rowe, William Phillips, and John Hancock, as \\"a veritable who's who of Boston smugglers\\".Archer, p. 77 Most of the merchants did not expect the agreement to apply to existing stock, or that they could not sell British goods. They had just agreed not to import them. In April 1769 a committee was formed to enforce the nonimportation agreement.Archer, p. 146 This committee began to demand inspections of merchants' premises and forced them to put proscribed goods into storage. Initially, the non-importation agreement created by Boston merchants was designed to have a definite time frame, specifically between January 1769 and December 1769.Archer, p. 145 The terms were agreed upon, and carried out rather successfully. Archer additionally wrote, \\"On May 2, after a report by the second committee, the body of merchants concluded that only six of the 211 signers of the Agreement had broken their word 'through Inattention,' by neglecting to countermand their orders placed in the fall.\\" This can be seen through two different lenses; on one hand, the agreement was largely successful, but on the other hand, it showed that Jackson, while in the minority, was not the only one who continued to sell imported goods. In retrospect, it makes sense that Jackson imported British made goods. Larger businesses were able to continue profiting during this time period, but family owned stores such as the Brazen Head did not have the capital or domestic connections necessary to prosper without importing goods. On top of this, it was agreed on that the period of nonimportation would continue past 1769 if necessary in an effort to strengthen the colonists' stance against the British.Archer, p. 149 Nonimportation was not exclusive to Boston, and those identified as importers were blacklisted all throughout New England. Jackson, for example, was listed in a newspaper located in New London, Connecticut in 1770. The newspaper printed a list of those who \\"audaciously\\" continued to import British goods, and singled out specific merchants as traitors to the revolutionary cause.New London Gazette, 1770 This shows the massive influence that the Sons of Liberty and the like had on the general population, and how much the organization's propaganda affected the colonial population.  Broadside  A picture of the broadside that publicized Jackson's rejection of the Non-Importation Agreement. Despite the clear economic strain that nonimportation was putting on Boston businesses, the Sons of Liberty wasted no time in shaming those who continued to import and sell British goods. After the May 2nd meeting cited earlier, the Sons of Liberty began publishing the names of storeowners who did not comply with the Non-Importation Agreement in Boston newspapers. This gave not only the importers a bad name, but also the consumers who continued to buy goods from the blacklisted stores. In the case of Jackson, the Sons of Liberty went even farther in their attack on the Brazen Head. They wrote and printed a broadside (a large, poster sized notice) condemning Jackson and the Brazen Head. It used passionate and charged language in its attempt to portray Jackson as a traitor. The broadside read, \\"WILLIAM JACKSON, an IMPORTER; at the BRAZEN HEAD, North Side of the TOWN- HOUSE, and Opposite the Town-Pump, [in] Corn-hill, BOSTON. It is desired that the SONS and DAUGHTERS of LIBERTY, would not buy any one thing of him, for in so doing they will bring disgrace upon themselves, and their Posterity, for ever and ever, AMEN.\\" The broadside also inspired violence amongst protesters. In late 1769 or early 1770, the approximate time frame when the broadside was first posted, an angry mob surrounded the Brazen Head and other Boston stores whose owners failed to comply with nonimportation. The mob created effigies in addition to the broadsides, and even attempted (but failed) to intentionally burn down Jackson's store. The intimidation and harassment Jackson was subject to by colonial patriots is an example of how brutally Loyalists in Boston were treated in the pre-revolutionary era. Boston, the epicenter of pre-war patriotism, proved to be a hostile environment for anyone who remained loyal to the crown. Later life After the Revolutionary War began, Jackson's public profile significantly decreased. The damage caused by the Sons of Liberty had been severe, and as revolutionary sentiments got stronger, the contempt directed at Jackson only intensified. In 1776, Jackson and other Loyalist merchants fled Boston with a good portion of the British military in hopes of reaching England, but American privateers intercepted the small fleet before reaching its destination. J.L. Bell, author of the brief article, \\"Escaping Tories: Captured at Sea,\\" stated, \\"According to the 8 April Boston Gazette, William Jackson was the new owner of the ship Manly (the captain of American privateering fleet) had captured, a prize estimated to be worth ¬£35,000 with the goods aboard.\\" Colonial authorities subsequently threw Jackson in jail, and the following year he was banished from Boston. Jackson had paid a dear price for loyalty; patriots used him as a symbol of a traitor, and destroyed his economic and personal lives. Not much is documented following his capture and arrest in 1776 as Jackson slowly faded out of Boston society. In 1777 he was put on trial for \\"attempting to profit from the distress caused by the Revolution\\" and exiled from Boston. It is known that Jackson received little compensation or pension from the British in return for his unwavering support at the end of the war. Shortly after he was banished from Boston, Jackson ended up moving to England, where he died in 1810.

It boasts a total of 28 wine cellars (11 producer cellars and 17 private cellars). The Breedekloof represents 14.24% (13 029 hectares) of wine grape vineyard plantings in South Africa. Most traditional cultivars can be found in the Breedekloof, with Chenin Blanc being the most planted.SAWIS 2016. SA Wine Industry Statistics. NR 40 View of the mountains in the Breedekloof  Location  The Breedekloof wine district is situated between Worcester and Paarl under the Breede River Valley Municipality. It includes the Rawsonville, Slanghoek, Goudini and Breerivier area. The west and south-west of Breedekloof borders the Slanghoek and Du Toitskloof Mountains and its north-eastern part is covered by the Hex River Mountains.  Terroir  The Breedekloof is characterized by a great combination of terroirs. Its is seamed by two mountain ranges, and nestled between the Atlantic Ocean and the Klein Karoo. The Breedekloof possesses a variety of soil that varies from deep heavy black soils to sandy shale soils in old river beds. This unique combination of soils and climate make it a favourable terroir for wine production. The Valley receives an annual winter rainfall of +- 700mm, which classifies it as a high rainfall area in South Africa., UniWines 2016. Vineyards in the Breedekloof  Economic activities  The main economic activity in the Breedekloof is agriculture. It is traditionally a wine- producing area, but peaches, prunes, pears and other crops are also grown. Tourism has also become an important industry in the area with new wedding venues and guest houses providing many opportunities.  Breedekloof Wine Route  The Breedekloof wine route is the youngest wine route in South Africa. It was established in 2002, South Africa Tourism 2016. and consists of 22 cellars. It runs from Gouda to Montagu (east to west) and McGregor to Tankwa-Karoo National Park (north to south). It forms part of Route 62, which claims to be the longest wine route in the world., SA Venues 2016.  Breedekloof Wine Festival - Soetes & Sop  Soetes & Sop is an annual wine festival, typically hosted in July, organized by Breedekloof wine & tourism office in Rawsonville. All participating cellars (14 in 2016) are open for the event. It is a decentralized event,, Cape Town Magazine 2016. allowing visitors to buy a ticket which includes a wine glass and soup mug which they can use at the different cellars for tastings. On the day visitors are able to taste a wide variety of multi award-winning soetes (also known as dessert wines), including Hanepoot, Muscadel, Noble Late Harvest, Red Jerepigo and Port. Further, many cellar pair these offerings with a variety of soups. , Breedekloof Wine Valley 2016.

This is a more aggressive strategy since the bishops may be exchanged at any time during the opening. (See: Ranging Rook#Types of Ranging Rook.) Cheerful Central Rook is played against a Static Rook opponent. White variation 1\\\\. P-77 P-34, 2. P-26. Open bishop diagonals. Black plays Static Rook. 2\\\\. ...P-54. White pushes the central pawn, the signature move of Cheerful Central Rook. 3\\\\. P-25. Rook pawn advance. 3\\\\. ...R-52. Central Rook move. Early pawn push After White swings their rook to the central file, pushing the second file pawn by Black (4. P-24) in order to trade the pawns off and get a pawn in hand is thought to be a mistake (although not quite a blunder) here since it will result in a position judged to be better for White. (Note the similarity of these lines with the old Central Rook vs Side Pawn joseki.) After the pawn push and pawn trade off (4. ...Px24, 5. Rx24), since the bishop diagonals are both open, White will trade off the bishops (5. ...Bx88+, 6. Sx88) and drop their bishop forking Black's rook and left silver (6. ...B*33). If Black plays 7. Rx21+ aggressively capturing White's knight, White replies with 7. ...Bx88+ capturing Black's silver and aiming to bring the promoted bishop back to the 22 square in order to capture Black's promoted rook. This continuation is believed to be better for White. In case Black retreats the rook with 7. R-28 after 6. ...B*33, White can play the move 7. ...P*26 aiming for P-27+ to push Black's rook off the second file. Castling Gote usually aims for an Incomplete Mino castle: However, there is always the option of a Bear-in-the-hole castle as well. Countermeasures=Maruyama Vaccine One of the most popular countermeasures against Cheerful Central Rook is the so-called Maruyama Vaccine (‰∏∏Â±±„ÉØ„ÇØ„ÉÅ„É≥, Maruyama wakuchin). Tadahisa Maruyama started playing it by 2002, and it received that name thanks to the actual Maruyama vaccine, a vaccine developed in Japan in the 1970s against some types of cancer. In the opening, before gote can move P-55, sente will go for a bishop exchange with 4. Bx22, Sx22 (see Diagram), with the aim of gaining a bishop in hand and turning the game into a slow one. In reaction to this move, the strategy developed so that the Ranging Rook side would switch from a Mino castle to an Opposing Rook. =The New Maruyama Vaccine= Once the position in the Maruyama vaccine's diagram was arrived at, sente's king would castle at 5. K-68. However, gote would reply then by dropping the bishop with ...B*33, from which sente would go with 6. N-77, and gote would push a pawn to ...P-74 aiming at the head of the knight, and dropping a bishop at 7. B*88 would be pointless following ...P-55. To avoid this situation, then, from the previous diagram the king won't move to 5. K-68, but instead the silver would move to 5. S-78 (see Diagram), a move that is called the New Maruyama Vaccine. By moving the silver there, sente will be fully prepared for gote's bishop drop at 33. =5. P-96= From the New Maruyama Vaccine diagram, the game will go next with 5. ...K-62, 6. S-48, P-55, and a bishop drop at 7. B*65, and from there ...G-32, 8. Bx83+, P-56, 9 +Bx56, Rx56, 10. Px56, and gote will have the advantage following ...B*88. Yasumitsu Sat≈ç developed a new move to prevent this situation, where instead of 5. S-78, the pawn is pushed with 5. P-96 (see Diagram). Following 5. P-96, if gote goes with ...P-9d sente will switch over to the New Maruyama Vaccine with 6. S-78. If instead gote goes ahead and pushes the central pawn with ...P-55, then 7. B*65, G-32, 8. Bx83+, P-56, 9. Px56, B*88, and with 10. L-97 sente is in a good position. This move became popular after Sat≈ç defeated Yoshiharu Habu in an official game using this strategy in July 2005.  Super Quick Attack G49-58  Rather than a countermeasure, the Super Quick Attack G49-58 (‚ñ≤5ÂÖ´ÈáëÂè≥Ë∂ÖÊÄ•Êà¶, Go-Hachi Kin Migi Chou Kyuusen) strategy can be called a strategy of mutual attack. From the basic position (i.e., 1\\\\. P-76, P-34; 2. P-26, P-54; 3. P-25, R-52), Black (sente) pushes the right gold with 4. G49-58, and White (gote) decides to go for an attacking race. This strategy was devised hurriedly by Takeshi Fujii in the middle of the 12th Ryuo title matches against Daisuke Suzuki, for which the latter had declared he'd be using ranging rook as a general strategy. The strategy started being played in that very same tournament. Following 4. G49-58, the game will continue with 4. ...P-55; 5. P-24, Px24; 6. Rx24. White can then respond with either 6. ...P-56 or 6. ...G-32, and it will turn into a super quick attack if the choice is 6. ...P-56 (Suzuki decided to go for a slow development by playing 6. G-32). From 6. P-56, the joseki goes 6. ...P-56; 7. Px56, Bx88+; 8. Sx88, B*33; 9. Rx21+, Bx88+; 10. N*55, K-62. While White has the advantage in terms of pieces, the knight drop at 10. N*55 is a powerful move. If White decides to defend from the fork by dropping 10. ...S*54, then Black will check with the powerful 11. B*33, and no matter how White defends, Black will get a Horse by capturing the lance without any loss, winning the position. Hence, White must move 10. ...K-62 instead, at which point, 11. +Rx11 will follow (see accompanying diagram). In the past, from the diagram, it was frequent to play 11. ...+Bx99. Against the lance capture at +Bx99 it was concluded by way of research that White will be at an advantage even after the powerful 12. L*66 and 13. B*33, but then Ry≈´ma Tonari (3-dan at the time) discovered the 12. L*33 move (see diagram). Whatever the case, in a super quick attack strategy the game frequently will reach its end in few moves, and as research shows, it will easily turn into a win-or-lose game. Moreover, against G-58 White can opt instead for castling the king, starting with 4. ...K-62, and there are other ways of preventing a decisive showdown. For this reason, with the exception of Toshiaki Kubo and K≈çji Tanigawa, it is rare to see this strategy played in title matches.

Unbaked and produced on-site either as adobe blocks or by pouring into mouldings (the rammed earth technique), it has significant economical and ecological advantages.A Compendium of Information on Selected Low-cost Building Materials. United Nations Center for Human Settlements, 1986, p. 40; Sustainable Building Design Manual, vol. 2: Sustainable building design practices, (New Delhi: Energy and Resources Institute, 2004), pp. 121, 131; Horst Schroeder, Sustainable Building with Earth (Heidelberg, New York: Springer, 2016), pp. 320 ff. Its physical and mechanical properties are superior to traditional earth construction materials, and are comparable to other stabilized earthen materials. The ratios of the mixture are determined in accordance with the purpose of construction. Alker has primarily been used as a wall construction material; for this purpose, the addition of 8-10% gypsum, 2.5-5% lime, and 20% water to earth produces optimum results. These ratios may change according to the nature and content of clay in the soil. Research The initial research for Alker was completed in 1980 at the Faculty of Architecture of Istanbul Technical University.Ruhi Kafescioƒülu, Nihat Toydemir, Erol G√ºrdal ve B√ºlent √ñz√ºer, ‚ÄúYapƒ± Malzemesi Olarak Kerpicin Al√ßƒ± ile Stabilizasyonu‚Äù, T√úBƒ∞TAK M√ºhendislik Ara≈ütƒ±rma Grubu, Proje no: 505, 1980. The word Alker is an abbreviation combining the first syllables of the Turkish words for Gypsum (Al√ßƒ±) and Adobe (Kerpi√ß). Alker was inspired by a traditional plaster material consisting of a mixture of earth, gypsum and lime, which has been in use in the earthen architecture of Anatolia since the neolithic era due to its high water resistance.Naumann, Rudolf, Architektur Kleinasiens von ihren Anf√§ngen bis zum Ende der hethitischen Zeit (Tubingen: Wasmuth, 1971); Gourdin, W.H. and W.D. Kingery, ‚ÄúThe Beginnings of Pyrotechnology: Neolithic and Egyptian Lime Plaster‚Äù, Journal of Field Archeology, v. 15 (1975):133-150. The initial project for Alker was based on the addition only of gypsum to earth with the appropriate qualities. The addition of lime was introduced later, and improved the material‚Äôs earthquake resistant properties. Research on the properties and application methods of Alker has continued, mainly at Istanbul Technical University.Ruhi Kafescioƒülu, ‚ÄúThermal Properties of Mudbricks: the Example of Gypsum Stabilized Adobe,‚Äù Proceedings of the Expert Group Meeting on Energy-Efficient Building Materials for Low-Cost Housing, United Nations Human Settlement Division, Amman, 1987Bilge I≈üƒ±k, Tugsad Tulbentci, Sustainable housing in island conditions using Alker-gypsum- stabilized earth: A case study from northern Cyprus, Building and Environment, Volume 43, Issue 9, September 2008, pp. 1426-1432Ruhi Kafescioƒülu, ‚ÄùGypsum- stabilized Adobe (Alker) Structures: An Evaluation of Their Social, Economic, and Environmental Advantages,‚Äù 8th International Seminar on Structural Masonry: Proceedings; 05-07 November 2008, ed.

One of the earliest among these, constructed in 1995 in Istanbul Technical University‚Äôs Ayazaƒüa Campus, has been in continuous use without necessitating significant repair. In this particular construction process, the material was poured into mouldings and rammed, with a view to exploring possibilities for mass construction with Alker. Properties Alker is characterized by its quick setting time (approximately 20 minutes), hence preventing clay shrinkage and eliminating the need for curing and drying processes. If needed, a retarding agent may also be added to the mixture. It is a porous material with a lower volumetric weight, and nearly four times more pressure resistance compared to traditional earthen wall materials. Structurally, Alker is comparable to concrete as a conglomerate material. It must be noted however that while properties of concrete improve in direct ratio to the amount of cement it contains, increased amounts of clay (the binding element) in the Alker mixture have negative effects on its physical properties, particularly in terms of pressure and erosion resistance.B. Pekmezci, R. Kafescioglu and I. Aghazadeh, \\"Improved Performance of Earth Structures by Lime and Gypsum Addition,\\" METU Journal of the Faculty of Architecture, v. 29, 2012, pp. 215-217 Alker exhibits high resistance to water-related erosion, in contrast to traditional unbaked earthen building materials which are characterized by poor resistance to water. In erosion tests pure earthen materials completely dissolve; the erosion rate in Alker is minimal. The material gains a rigidity of 0.375 MPa during the setting process, within the first twenty minutes after pouring. It gains rigidity while containing 20% moisture, which makes it possible to remove mouldings and stack blocks shortly after pouring the material.B. Pekmezci, R. Kafescioglu and I. Aghazadeh, \\"Improved Performance of Earth Structures by Lime and Gypsum Addition,\\" METU Journal of the Faculty of Architecture, v. 29, 2012, pp. 206-209. Its unit weight is lower than those of comparable building materials. Its shrinkage and expansion rates are low, and are comparable to those of concrete. As such, it can be poured continuously without necessitating a contraction joint. It is characterized by resistance to water and moisture. The ratio of lime in the mixture can be modified in order to completely eliminate water-related erosion. Experiments on capillary water absorption have shown that increased amounts of lime in the mixture results in an increase in quantity and in reduced width of capillary canals, proving the material‚Äôs erosion resistance. Compressive and shear strength and modules of elasticity and rigidity present advantages in terms of earthquake resistance. Once the mixture is poured into a mould, the production process is completed, and a significant degree of rigidity is reached. It does not require curing and drying, providing economy of time, labor, and energy. Resistance to pressure is 3,5 - 4 MPa. The lime in the mixture reduces resistance to pressure to a minimal degree, while increasing elasticity and resistance to impact. During pressure tests cube-shaped blocks fracture in pyramidal forms, comparable to concrete blocks, and do not disintegrate in the way unstabilized earthen blocks do.Ruhi Kafescioglu, \\"Gypsum-stabilized Adobe (Alker) Structures: An Evaluation of Their Social, Economic, and Environmental Advantages,\\" 8th International Seminar on Structural Masonry: Proceedings, 05-07 November 2008, ed. L. Tanacan, Istanbul: ITU, 2008, pp. 51-59 Alker is not a patented material. It has been developed with the aim of creating a widely used low-cost Ecological Building material available for self-building as well as for larger sustainable architecture projects. A number of projects have been developed that are based on Alker (gypsum- and lime-stabilized earth) technology. Among these is cast earth, which uses the Alker mixture with the addition of a retarding agent in order to lengthen the setting time. If Alker is to be produced on the construction site, addition of a retarding agent is not necessary.

The compound is used, inter alia, as catalyst for oxidation reactions, in particular for the selective oxidation (e. g. alkanes to alcohols) with molecular oxygen under mild conditions. Occurrence and production The synthesis of N-hydroxyphthalimide from phthaloyl chloride and hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of sodium carbonate in aqueous solution was first reported by Lassar Cohn in 1880 (referred to as \\"Phthalylhydroxylamin\\"). Synthesis of N-hydroxyphthalimide from phthaloyl chloride using hydroxylamine hydrochloride The product forms as a red sodium salt under basic conditions, while white N-hydroxyphthalimide precipitates in 55% yield as the solution is acidified. N-hydroxyphthalimide is also produced by reacting hydroxylamine hydrochloride with diethyl phthalate in the presence of sodium acetate, or with phthalic anhydride in the presence of sodium carbonate with heating. In the last case, an overall yield of 76% is produced following purification by recrystallization. Microwave irradiation of phthalic anhydride and hydroxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine produces N-hydroxyphthalimide in 81% yield. Even in the absenceof a base, phthalic anhydride and hydroxylamine phosphate react to produce N-hydroxyphthalimide in 86% yield when heated to 130 ¬∞C. Preparation of N-hydroxyphthalimide from phthalic anhydride Properties N-Hydroxyphthalimide is a colorless to yellow, odorless crystalline powder which is soluble in water and organic solvents such as acetic acid, ethyl acetate and acetonitrile. The compound exists in two different-colored monoclinic crystal forms. In case of the colorless white form, the N-OH group is rotated about 1.19¬∞ from the plane of the molecule, while in the yellow form it is much closer to planarity (0.06¬∞ rotation). The color of the synthesized N-hydroxyphthalimide depends on the type of solvent used; the color transition from white to yellow is irreversible. N-hydroxyphthalimide forms strongly colored, mostly yellow or red salts with alkali and heavy metals, ammonia and amines. Hydrolysis of N-hydroxyphthalimide by the addition of strong bases produces phthalic acid monohydroxamic acid by adding water across one of the carbon-nitrogen bonds. N-hydroxyphthalimide ethers, on the other hand, are colorless and provide O-alkylhydroxylamines by alkaline hydrolysis or cleavage through hydrazine hydrate. The \\"phthalylhydroxylamine\\" reported by Cohn was known to have a molecular formula of but the exact structure was not known. Three possibilities were discussed and are shown in the Figure below: a mono-oxime of phthalic anhydride (\\"phthaloxime\\", I), an expanded ring with two heteroatoms, (2,3-benzoxazine-1,4-dione, II), and N-hydroxyphthalimide (III). It was not until the 1950s that Cohn's product was definitely shown to be (III), N-hydroxyphthalimide. Three structural isomers of considered as Cohn's \\"phthalylhydroxylamine\\" Applications and reactions Nefkens and Tesser developed a technique for generating active esters from N-hydroxyphthalimide for use in peptide synthesis, an approach later extended to using N-hydroxysuccinimide. The ester linkage is formed between the N-hydroxyphthalimide and a carboxylic acid by elimination of water, the coupling achieved with N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC). For peptide synthesis, the N-terminus of the growing peptide is protected with tert- butyloxycarbonyl while its C-terminus (Z-NH-CH(R)-COOH) is coupled to N-hydroxyphthalimide. An ester of the next amino acid in the desired peptide sequence is shaken with activated ester, adding to the chain and displacing the N-hydroxyphthalimide. This reaction is quantitative and nearly instantaneous at 0 ¬∞C. The resulting ester needs to be hydrolysed before the cycle can be repeated. Conversion of C-terminus of peptide to an active ester of N-hydroxyphthalimide The N-hydroxyphthalimide can be removed by shaking with sodium bicarbonate, but the N-hydroxysuccinimide approach shows greater reactivity and convenience, and is generally preferred. Esters of N-hydroxyphthalimide and activated sulfonic acids such as trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride or p-toluenesulfonyl chloride are used as so-called photoacids, which split off protons during UV irradiation. UV- Reaktion mit NHPI-triflat The protons generated serve for the targeted local degradation of acid-sensitive photoresists. N-hydroxyphthalimide can be converted with vinyl acetate in the presence of palladium(II)acetate to the N-vinyloxyphthalimide, which is quantitatively hydrogenated to N-ethoxyphthalimide and after purified by cleavage, yielding O-ethylhydroxylamine. Darstellung von O-Alkoxyaminen via N-Hydroxyphthalimid A variety of different functional groups can be oxidized with the aminoxyl radical (phthalimide-N-oxyl, PINO) formed by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from N-hydroxyphthalimide under gentle conditions (similar to TEMPO): Bildung des PINO-Radikals Using molecular oxygen alkanes can be oxidized to form alcohols, secondary alcohols to ketones, acetals to esters and alkenes to epoxides. Amides can be converted into carbonyl compounds with N-hydroxyphthalimide and cobalt(II)salts under mild conditions. Oxidation von Amiden mit N-Hydroxyphthalimid Efficient oxidation reactions of precursors of important basic chemicals are of particular technical interest. For example, Œµ-caprolactam can be prepared using NHPI from the so-called KA oil (\\"ketone- alcohol\\" oil, a mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone) which is obtained during the oxidation of cyclohexane. The reaction proceeds via cyclohexanol hydroperoxide which reacts with ammonia to give peroxydicyclohexylamine followed by a rearrangement in the presence of catalytic amounts of lithium chloride. Oxidation von KA-√ñl zu Caprolactam The use of N-hydroxyphthalimide as a catalyst in the oxidation of KA oil avoids the formation of the undesirable by-product ammonium sulfate which is produced by the conventional Œµ-caprolactam synthesis (Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime with sulfuric acid). Alkanes are converted into nitroalkanes in the presence of nitrogen dioxide. Nitrierung/Oxidation von Cyclohexan mittels NHPI Cyclohexane is converted at 70 ¬∞C with nitrogen dioxide/air into a mixture of nitrocyclohexane (70%), cyclohexyl nitrate (7%) and cyclohexanol (5%). Furthermore, applications of N-hydroxyphthalimide as oxidizing agents in photographic developers and as charge control agents in toners have been described in the patent literature. Phthalimido-N-oxyl (PINO) The radical derived by removal of an H-atom from N-hydroxyphthalimide is called N-phthalimido-N-oxyl, acronym being PINO. It is a powerful H-atom abstracting agent. The bond dissociation energy of NHPI (i.e., PINO-H) is between 88-90 kcal/mol, depending on the solvent.

The Signalong methodology has been effectively used with individuals who have cognitive impairments, autism, Down's Syndrome, specific language impairment, multisensory impairment and acquired neurological disorders that have negatively affected the ability to communicate, including stroke patients and English as an additional language. The name \\"Signalong\\" is derived from the understanding that wherever possible the sign is accompanied with speech, hence you \\"sign along with speech\\". The programme was devised in 1991 by Gill Kennard, a language teacher, Linda Hall, a science teacher who produced the illustrations and Thelma Grove, a speech and language therapist from the Royal College of Speech & Language Therapists. Signalong is a registered trade mark of The Signalong Group, a charity established in 1994. The original trademark application for Signalong was filed in the UK on 30 April 2001, with registration approved as from that date under UK trademark registration no. 2268715.  Programme  Signalong uses a total communication approach to teach language and literacy skills, through a combination of speech, signs and descriptions at the appropriate level for the child or adult's needs. Because of its unique methodology of handshape, orientation, placement and movement, idiosyncratic signs can be de-coded and translated to a format that is consistent and transferable. Signalong consists of a Core Vocabulary of approximately 1726 concepts but is not taught in a specific order. Vocabulary should be introduced when required and where possible, with real objects and in real situations to help re-enforce the link between the sign and spoken word. Although Signalong is a key word signing system, once initial communication has been established, the learner can develop their language to 2, 3 or 4 word level as appropriate. In addition to the Core Vocabulary, there is an additional 7,000 concepts.  Development  In 1983 Kent County Council was adopting the Derbyshire Language Scheme (DLS), a flexible framework following typical language development that is used to help children develop their language skills. The DLS vocabulary is based on research into the type of objects and activities experienced by children as they develop. In 1991 due to the lack of vocabulary available from existing signing systems, Gill and Thelma developed vocabulary on the single-word level of the DLS and on the vocabulary that had been requested by parents and carers at Abbey Court School. It has remained one of Signalong's most dearly held principles that the vocabulary should be led by the needs of the user of the resource and not dictated by others. The first ‚Äúpilot‚Äù copies of Phase 1 were published in April 1992 and as word of Signalong's existence spread the team came under heavy pressure to produce signs for sex education. Although they were already working on Phase 2, this was set aside and, in June 1993, ‚ÄúPersonal and Social Education‚Äù was the next manual to be published. This brought Signalong to the attention of a much wider user group, the vocabulary being seen as particularly relevant to older learners and adults and in 1994 achieved charitable status. Signalong have over 70 different publications to date. Signalong resources are designed to be self-explanatory and accessible, however by popular demand, the first Signalong training in sign-supported communication was made available in May 1992 and subsequent Tutor training in 1995.  Use  Signalong is based on British Sign Language adapted for the needs and abilities of children and adults with verbal communication difficulties. It uses one sign per concept, one concept per sign. Signalong is a sign‚Äìsupporting system used in spoken word order and uses a total communication approach to reference links between sign and word. It also uses key-words i.e. the essential word in any sentence, and uses signs at partner's level and moderate language to ensure that the message is understood. It is best to start with real objects and real experiences, generalise concepts before moving on to more abstract representations. Vocabulary is needs led and feedback from users helps Signalong to decide on vocabulary research. When the sign has been selected, a description is worked out. This follows a consistent method of four elements; handshape - how the hands are formed; orientation - how the hands are held; placement - where the hands are held and movement - any changes in the first three elements. Signalong is used extensively throughout the UK, but has also been adapted for use in countries including France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Germany and Romania.

The orange curve rises steeply from 17:00 to 18:00 as the sun sets, requiring about 5 gigawatt of generating capacity from dispatchable sources to come on line within one hour. In utility-scale electricity generation, the duck curve is a graph of power production over the course of a day that shows the timing imbalance between peak demand and renewable energy production. The term was coined in 2012 by the California Independent System Operator.  Solar power  In many energy markets the peak demand occurs after sunset, when solar power is no longer available. In locations where a substantial amount of solar electric capacity has been installed, the amount of power that must be generated from sources other than solar or wind displays a rapid increase around sunset and peaks in the mid-evening hours, producing a graph that resembles the silhouette of a duck.Paul Denholm, Matthew O‚ÄôConnell, Gregory Brinkman, and Jennie Jorgenson. \\"Overgeneration from Solar Energy in California: A Field Guide to the Duck Chart\\" NREL/TP-6A20-65023. National Renewable Energy Laboratory, November 2015 In Hawaii, significant adoption of solar generation has led to the more pronounced curve known as the Nessie curve. Without any form of energy storage, after times of high solar generation generating companies must rapidly increase power output around the time of sunset to compensate for the loss of solar generation, a major concern for grid operators where there is rapid growth of photovoltaics. Storage can fix these issues if it can be implemented. Flywheels have shown to provide excellent frequency regulation. Short term use batteries, at a large enough scale of use, can help to flatten the duck curve and prevent generator use fluctuation and can help to maintain voltage profile. However, cost is a major limiting factor for energy storage as each technique is expensive to produce at scale. Mitigation strategies Methods for coping with the rapid increase in demand at sunset reflected in the duck curve, which becomes more serious as the penetration of solar generation grows, include: *Installing more dispatchable generation *Orienting some solar collectors toward the west to maximize generation near sunset. *Energy storage including: **Pumped- storage hydroelectricity **Battery storage power stations **Solar thermal energy with thermal energy storage **Ice storage air conditioning **Use of batteries in electric vehicles for temporary storage (vehicle-to-grid) **Power-to-X *Energy demand management, including: **Transitioning to more efficient lighting systems, such as compact fluorescent and LED lighting **Time-of-use pricing (TOU) and real-time pricing **Smart grid technology **Electric power transmission from the west where the sun is shining to the east where the sun is low A major challenge is deploying mitigating capacity at a rate that keeps up with the growth of solar energy production. The effects of the duck curve have happened faster than anticipated. =Duck curve in California= The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) has been monitoring and analyzing the Duck Curve and its future expectations for about a half a century now and their biggest finding is the growing gap between morning and evening hours prices relative to midday hours prices. According to their last study, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, found that the wholesale energy market prices over the past six months during the 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. period (the ‚Äúneck‚Äù of the duck) have increased to $60 per megawatt-hour, compared to about $35 per megawatt-hour in the same time frame in 2016. However, on the other side they have measured a drastic decrease in the midday prices, nearing $15 per megawatt-hour. These high peaks and deep valleys are only showing continued trends of going further apart making this Duck Curve even more prevalent as renewable energy production continues to grow. A crucial part of this curve comes from the Net Load (\\"the difference between expected load and anticipated electricity production from the range of renewable energy sources\\"). In certain times of the year (namely Spring and Summer), the curves create a ‚Äúbelly‚Äù appearance in the midday that then drastically increases portraying an ‚Äúarch‚Äù similar to the neck of a duck, consequently the name ‚ÄúThe Duck Chart.‚Äù During the midday, large amounts of solar energy are created, which partially contributes to lower demand for additional electricity. Increasing battery storage can mitigate the issues of solar abundance during the day. When excess solar energy is stored during the day and used in the evening, the price disparity between inexpensive midday and expensive evening energy can be reduced. Enough total solar technology exists to power the world, but there is a current lack of infrastructure to store solar energy for later use. An oversupply of energy during low demand coupled with a lack of supply during high demand explains the large disparity between midday and evening energy prices.

She was instrumental in founding the Rodenbach Brewery in Roeselare.  Biography  Born in Mechelen, Regina Wauters was the daughter of a rich local brewer. She married Pedro Rodenbach in 1818 and moved to Roeselare in West Flanders, Belgium, where his family had a distillery. In 1821 Pedro took along with his brothers and sister a brewery. The brothers agreed to a partnership for fifteen years. At the end of this period, Pedro and Regina bought the brewery from the others and Regina ran the business while Pedro served in the military during the Belgian revolution. Rodenbach bought the distillery from his family in 1835. He died in Brussels in 1848. His family sold the distillery to Regina Wauters, Her distillery remained for a long time the only significant distillery in Roeselare. Regina extended it immediately after she bought it. Later she asked her eldest son, Raymond, to work in the distillery. Raymond Rodenbach would continue to run the distillery until c.1895. The distillery was later sold to Honor√© Talpe who transformed it into a chicory factory. Regina invested her money not only in the distillery of the Rodenbachs but also in their brewery. In 1836 the family Rodenbach sold the brewery in Roeselare with numerous other properties. Pedro Rodenbach would buy most of it with the money of Regina. Pedro had to sign legal documents to recognize her as sole proprietary of the brewery and any other property that he had bought from his family. Regina immediately began to expand the brewery. Although she succeeded in building one of the largest distilleries in the region, she would fail to create the largest brewery in the city. She suffered from the fierce competition with Anna Gesquiere, who also ran a brewery in Roeselare. In 1860 her son Edward Rodenbach came to work in the brewery and it was during his directorship that the brewery expanded outside Roeselare. In 1864 Regina sold him, at the age of 69, her brewery, her house and workshops, along with eleven bars she had bought. Regina Wauters would retire to live on her private means until her death in 1874.  References  Further reading  * Dappere dynamische dames. Roeselaarse vrouwen in de kijker.

Life Archibald was the son of Sir Colin Og Campbell of Lochawe and his wife Helena, a possible daughter of John de Menteith. He became Lord of Lochawe either through inheritance from his father or the disenfranchisement of his brother, Dougall. In 1342, King David II granted Archibald the forfeited lands of his brother Dougall as well as the barony of Melfort. Melfort was in turn granted to Archibald's half- brother Neil, from whom the Campbells of Kenmore and Melfort descend. In the 1350s, Archibald was granted numerous properties in Argyll by John, Lord of Menteith and John's cousin Mary de Menteith, most notably Castle Sween. In 1373, he received the lands of Finnart and Stronewhillen from Paul Glenn. In 1382, he and his son, Colin, were appointed the hereditary position of King's Lieutenants and Special Commissioners in the Sheriffdom of Argyll, which would provide them income in exchange for performing various bureaucratic duties.  Marriage and issue  According to Ane Accompt of the Genealogie of the Campbells, Archibald married Isabella, daughter of John Lamont. She is referred to as Mary in other sources.

The 228th was made up of recruits from West Side, Chicago, and the western and northwestern parts of the Chicago area, and trained often at Camp Grayling.http://www.kurtgippert.com/pages/books/014478/otto-l- mcbride/history-228th-infantry-regiment-1947-1952 References 228 228 Category:Military units and formations established in 1947 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1952 ","title":"228th Infantry Regiment (United States)"},{"id":"52077598","text":"Robert E. MacLaren FMedSci FRCOphth FRCS FACS VR is a British ophthalmologist who has led pioneering work in the treatment of blindness caused by diseases of the retina. He is Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Oxford and Honorary Professor of Ophthalmology at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology. He is a Consultant Ophthalmologist at the Oxford Eye Hospital and an Honorary Consultant Ophthalmologist at the Great Ormond Street Hospital. He is also an Honorary Consultant Vitreo-retinal Surgeon at the Moorfields Eye Hospital. MacLaren is an NIHR Senior Investigator, or lead researcher, for the speciality of Ophthalmology. In addition, he is a member of the research committee of Euretina: the European Society of Retina specialists, Fellow of Merton College, in Oxford and a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy. Early life Edinburgh Medical School, Teviot Place Robert MacLaren was born on 14 November 1966, at Epsom in Surrey. His father was a photographer, which prompted an early interest in optics. MacLaren was educated and trained at the University of Edinburgh Medical School, from 1985 to 1990, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine (MB) and a Bachelor of Surgery (ChB). Dr. MacLaren then earned an academic doctorate, between 1992 and 1995, at the University of Oxford, where the PhD is known as a DPhil. The doctorate was for his work on optic-nerve regeneration. As an undergraduate, he also attended courses at Yale University, in the United States. Ophthalmology MacLaren was appointed Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Oxford in March 2009. In February of the same year, he was made Honorary Professor of Ophthalmology at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology. He has been a Fellow of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (FRCOphth) since June 2003. MacLaren is a professor in the Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology (NLO), the academic ophthalmology outstation of Oxford University's Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, which is part of the Medical Sciences Division and based in the John Radcliffe Hospital. MacLaren is described as 'one of the stars' of the developing inter-disciplinary field of ophthalmic translational medicine (TM). This combines practical skills in eye surgery with clinical academic application in research, to investigate the diseases of the eye 'from bench to bedside': aiming to improve patient outcomes, at least by arresting or slowing the progress of a disease, or ‚Äì ideally ‚Äì by reversing the effects, partially or totally. Once the processes of the diseases are understood, new surgical technologies are furthering the options for a surgical solution and new ophthalmic technologies have created a variety of implants, such as electronic retinal devices for prosthesis. Furthermore, the enhanced precision of surgery allows additional interventions, with the application of gene therapy and stem-cell therapy to retinal dystrophies (inherited conditions). Surgery Horizontal section of right eye, looking upwards. The retina and macula are at the back of the eye MacLaren has been a Consultant Ophthalmic Surgeon for the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (OUH) since March 2009. His surgical work is based largely at the Oxford Eye Hospital and the Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology [NLO], both located within the John Radcliffe Hospital, on Headington Hill in Oxford. He has also been Honorary Consultant Vitreoretinal Surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, in London, since May 2006. He has been a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd) since July 1998 and was awarded their annual King James IV Professorship in 2007. He is one of the first surgeons in the world to have made a successful retinal implant for visual prosthesis, sometimes described as creating: a 'bionic eye'. He is also a pioneer in robot-assisted surgery for ophthalmic operations. Key events of his work at the Moorfields and John Radcliffe hospitals include: ;2007 World's First Retinal Gene-Therapy Surgery MacLaren was the assistant surgeon to (Professor) James Bainbridge and helped perform the world's first retinal gene therapy treatment. The operation was carried out at Moorfields in London. The patient was Mr. Robert Johnson, a young man with Leber's Congenital Amaurosis (LCA). A faulty gene in the pigment layer, RPE65, prevented his photoreceptor cells from working, so a valid copy of the gene was implanted in one eye to 'patch' the blind-spot and restore function. The delicate operation required passing a needle through the eye, to lift the retina and insert the new gene-copy in the pigment layer. ;2011 Choroideremia Gene Therapy Trial This trial was funded by the Health Innovation Challenge Fund and the Oxford (OUH) BRC. It addressed the progress of the disease choroideremia, or choroideraemia, in which a faulty gene, CHM, leads to a loss of REP1 protein, affecting the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and causing progressive loss of vision. On 24 November 2011, Mr. Jonathan Wyatt, a Bristol barrister, received a 'good copy' of the REP1 gene, administered through an adeno-associated virus (AAV) ‚Äì serotype 2 (AAV2) ‚Äì as a vector, in fluid under the retina. By 2016, the results of the trial appeared both 'promising and lasting' and further work was authorised, with a view to seeing whether the process could eventually be applied to more common conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). ;2012/2015 Electronic Retinal Implant Trials These trials, funded by the NIHR and the Oxford (OUH) BRC, tested the ability of an electronic retina to replace a retina that has become damaged, a development common in patients with the hereditary condition retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The implants were developed by German company Retina Implant AG. The devices also require a power-plant to be inserted behind the ear, in the manner of a cochlear implant. The pilot-trial of 22 March 2012 tested the Alpha IMS device. The supporting power-plant procedure was carried out by surgeon Mr. James Ramsden with Mr. Markus Groppe. The main operation was undertaken, at Oxford, by MacLaren with Mr. Tim Jackson, consultant surgeon at Kings College Hospital. The patient was Chris James, a council-worker from Wiltshire. MacLaren suggested that if the trial were successful, an electronic retina could become standard for patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). He warned that current devices were not suitable to treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or diseases of the optic-nerve, such as glaucoma. The following week, Mr. Jackson, with Prof. MacLaren, operated on Robin Millar, a music-producer, in London; another four UK patients also received the device during that year. On 8 June 2015, the improved Alpha AMS device was implanted in the first patient, again with MacLaren carrying out the procedure, in Oxford. ;2016 Robot- Assisted Surgery Trial In the past, retinal diseases of the eye could be monitored to microscopic level ‚Äì using laser scanners and microscopes ‚Äì but interventions were not possible because the delicate nature of the eye meant that surgical operations were beyond the physiological limits of the human hand. On 9 September 2016, operating at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, MacLaren and Dr. Thomas Edwards performed the world's first robot-assisted operation inside the eye. The patient was the Rev. Dr. William Beaver, a local priest. This operation was described as the 'R2D2 Trial', because it was testing the safety and efficacy of the Robotic Retinal-Dissection Device (R2D2), developed by Dutch firm Preceyes BV (pronounced: precise!). The operation involved lifting off a damaged membrane, 100th millimetre thick, from the retina, at the back of the eye; the robot's tolerance, however, would have allowed work to 1000th millimetre. The operation proved the efficacy of the new technologies available, allowing the possibility of exploiting their potential to new scientific and a medical ends: MacLaren said that with robotic systems, a whole new chapter of eye surgery had just begun. ;2017 X-linked Retinitis Pigmentosa Gene Therapy Trial Mutations in the X-linked RPGR gene are the most common cause of severe sight loss in retinitis pigmentosa. The RPGR gene contains a highly repetitive sequence of purine bases in the DNA with a large section comprising almost exclusively Guanine or Adenine nucleotides, which made it very difficult to clone it for gene therapy. Using a form of gene editing known as codon-optimisation, MacLaren and members of his research team were able to engineer a stable version of RPGR that was expressed highly efficiently in an AAV vector. This led to the first gene therapy trial for X-linked retinitis pigmentosa sponsored by Nightstar and with MacLaren as the surgeon. Research The Oxford NIHR Biomedical Research Centre (OxBRC) is, as evidenced by NIHR funding allocation, one of England and the UK's leading centres for medical research. It is sometimes styled 'Oxford (OUH) NIHR BRC' since the establishment of a second BRC in Oxford: the Oxford Health NIHR BRC. The OxBRC's NHS Host is the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, where Mr. MacLaren is a Consultant Ophthalmologist and its Academic Partner is the University of Oxford, where MacLaren is also Professor of Ophthalmology. Additionally, in 2016, the NIHR appointed MacLaren to be a senior investigator, or lead researcher, for the speciality of ophthalmology. Between March 2001 and April 2006, Dr. MacLaren was a Resident Clinical Research Fellow at the Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Trust, in London. He was then a faculty member and a founding research-theme leader in the Moorfields ‚Äì UCL Institute of Ophthalmology Biomedical Research Centre, which was then the specialist BRC for Ophthalmology. His current clinical and laboratory research efforts focus on the forms of blindness which are to date incurable. By understanding the causes of retinal degeneration, it may be possible to slow, arrest or ameliorate the processes. The ultimate aim is then to reverse such effects and to restore working vision. The research efforts concentrate on two areas of the eye in particular: the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and the photoreceptors. The NLO Clinical Ophthalmology Research Group ('the MacLaren Group') is looking at replacement methods for each, and for both, to improve patient outcomes. Electronic retinal implants have already been trialled to treat retinitis pigmentosa, and trials are now being conducted to treat choroideremia through gene-therapy: implanting missing or faulty genes to correct retinal dystrophies (inherited conditions). As well as retinal issues, research is undertaken to improve outcomes for conditions relating to the lens and to the optic nerve, such as improved intra-ocular lenses (IOL) for cataract operations and therapies for glaucoma. Teaching Oxford University DPhil, in full academicals. In addition to his other duties, MacLaren has a full programme of teaching and tutoring. He is formally qualified, with a Postgraduate Diploma in Learning and Teaching in Higher Education (PGDipLATHE) from 2006. He has been a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy since June 2003. As a Bodley Fellow ‚Äì the active staff of the college ‚Äì at Merton, since October 2007, he is a stipendiary lecturer in human anatomy. He has held weekly tutorials in medical sciences for undergraduates since 1992: anatomy, genetics and cell biology for Year 1, and neuroanatomy and visual neuroscience for year 2; third year FHS topics relate to gene therapy, stem cells or visual neuroscience. As a mentor at the Academy of Medical Sciences, he supervises clinical academics. He also supervises junior doctors training in ophthalmic surgery and DPhil research students. Business In 2014, with Oxford University, he co-founded the private bio- technology company NightstaRx Ltd., also known Nightstar, in which he remains a director, and which is based at the offices of the Wellcome Trust in London. The technology spin-out was developed with Oxford Innovation, Ltd. and Syncona Ltd. and the clinical-stage company now is backed by Syncona, NEA venture capital and Oxford Science Equity-Management (OSEM).https://www.synconaltd.com/case-study/nightstarx/ It was formed to develop commercial gene therapy treatments to treat choroideremia ‚Äì an inherited cause of blindness affecting 1 in 50, 000 ‚Äì and other forms of inherited retinal dystrophy. The company has received four rounds of funding, including its IPO on NASDAQ in September 2017.https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/nightstar-therapeutics- plc-1031815-84628 Military the grounds of the HAC, Armoury House Professor MacLaren is also a commissioned officer in Group A ‚Äì the units intended for operational service ‚Äì of the Territorial Army, now Army Reserve, of the British Army. As a qualified doctor, he served as a Medical Officer (MO) in the Royal Army Medical Corps. He achieved the rank of major. MacLaren was posted to the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) and, in due course, became the Surgeon-Major: the Regimental Medical Officer (RMO). The term Surgeon- Major applied to all the unit's RMOs, most of whom were in General Practice (GP), and it was coincidental that Major MacLaren was primarily an occupational surgeon. Major MacLaren also served as locum RMO to the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, at Knightsbridge in London. In addition to serving as an RMO, Major MacLaren volunteered for an operational tour, in the former Yugoslavia, engaged in the field of military medicine, as part of 1st Mechanised Brigade, with case-work based more on occupational injury and trauma medicine, rather than disease and genetics. Having served as a member of the Volunteer Reserves for more than a decade, Major MacLaren, RAMC qualifies for the post-nominals: VR. Family life Robert MacLaren is married with three children: two boys and a girl. He is the grandson of the lawyer Robert Edwin Newbery MC, great-great grandson of the Victorian actor/playwright James Roland MacLaren and great-great-great grandson of the engineer Sampson Moore.

The industry was the second largest export sector of Bangladesh in FY 2014‚Äì2015. The industry also plays a good role in creating employment. However, Human Right Watch reported that it is responsible for pollution of air, water, and soil, that lead to serious health problems in the population. It is also known to be largely involved in child labour. Set up of tannery industry in Bangladesh The first tannery in what is now Bangladesh was set up at Narayanganj sometime in the 1940s by a businessman R.P. Shaha. The tannery was later shifted to Hazaribagh area in Dhaka. In 1965, there were 30 tanneries in Dhaka. After the independence of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Government acquired the 30 tanneries. The industry had a significant development in 1970s. Situation Increasing interest of buyers has opened up an opportunity for footwear and leather industries of Bangladesh. The production of leather-made items has been increasing in the country. The sector has the potential for becoming the second largest foreign currency earner after ready-made garments. Industry analysts believe that Bangladesh's over one billion footwear industry has the potential to grow to a 15-billion dollar vibrant industry within a decade. According to EPB data, the leather industry has crossed the record $1-billion mark in 2012‚Äì13. Bangladesh earned $1.29 billion from exports of leather, leather goods and footwear in 2013‚Äì14 fiscal. The export target for 2014‚Äì15 has been set with an increase by 4.2 per cent. This rate of growth needs to be progressively accelerated to attain the target of $5 billion in 2020.Leather industry of Bangladesh Exports of leather and leather goods crossed $1 billion for the second year in fiscal 2014‚Äì15, according to data from the Export Promotion Bureau.Leather sector's exports cross $1b for second year Education Institute of Leather Engineering and Technology The Institute of Leather Engineering & Technology is an educational institution at Hazaribagh, Dhaka, Bangladesh that provides education related to making leather, leather products and footwear. The institute offers graduate courses through the University of Dhaka. It is an institute of University of Dhaka where admission is given through the admission test of A unit. It was the only educational institution of its kind in the country before Khulna University of Engineering & Technology introduced Leather Engineering Department for honours. Khulna University of Engineering & Technology is the another university which offers degree in Leather Engineering. The department of Leather Engineering started its journey form 2010 and till now 4 batches successfully completed their graduation. Opportunities and Challenges Leather is a unique commodity that links grassroots villages with high societies and traditional practices with emerging technologies. For many developing countries, leather and leather manufacturers constitute an indispensable and dependable source for export trade and foreign exchange earnings. For Bangladesh, leather is a high priority industrial sector and footwear exports, an extreme focus area. Bangladesh has, just few decades since Independence, made significant gains from the leather trade, progressing from the status of an exporter of 90% plus raw hides and skins to that of an exporter and predominantly leather product manufacturer. However, there is little systematic research into this sector. This study is trying to address the research gap by seeking to understand the current status, problems and prospect of leather industry in Bangladesh.Leather Industry in Bangladesh: Opportunities and Challenges It is notable that China, the world's largest footwear manufacturer, is now withdrawing from the global leather goods market. And Bangladesh is ready with huge potentials to attract foreign investments in the sector. According to a report, China's annual leather footwear production had dropped by 5.29 per cent in 2012 and 7.45 per cent in 2013. While asked about the reasons for China's focus shift, Bangladesh Footwear and Footwear Accessories Association (BFFAA) said labour cost in China has gone up. In consequence the Bangladeshi manufacturers are seeing brighter prospects for the leather sector after the readymade garment industry because of a policy shift in China, the world's largest economy.Daily-sun Country's leather industry is facing a number of problems. The tanneries of Hazaribagh area in the capital have not been fully shifted to Savar where favourable conditions have been created as per the criteria set by most buyers. Technical know-how of the workers needs to be developed to cope up with new challenges in this industry.Leather industry Leather Goods Manufacturers and suppliers * Helena Enterprise Ltd * Bata Shoe Co.

Inspired by both liberation theology and feminist theology, it aims to contextualize them to the conditions and experiences of Asian women.  History  The first recognizable collective attempt to do Asian feminist theology can be traced to the late 1970s, which saw the formation of theological networks and centres that aimed to study the gendered dimension of both theology and society. The Conference of Theologically Trained Women of Asia was founded in January 1981 followed by The Women's Commission of the Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians (EATWOT) in 1983. The first Asian women's theological journal In God‚Äôs Image was founded in 1982 and helped form the Asian Women's Resource Centre for Culture and Theology in 1988. These organizations, networks and centres allowed Asian female theologians to discuss strategies for dealing with patriarchy in society, the church and theology, which they saw as unhelpfully dependent on the West.  Context  Kwok Pui-lan Although there was Asian theology being written during the 1960s, this \\"water buffalo\\" theology was written mostly by men who looked to traditional Asian culture and practices as sources for their theology. In doing so however, they neglected the experiences of women and tended to romanticize Asian traditions without properly critiquing its patriarchal elements. Chinese theologian Kwok Pui-lan writes \\"challenging the colonial legacy, these theologians sometimes were too eager to embrace the cultural traditions of Asia, without taking sufficient notice of their elitist and sexist components.\\" Wai-Ching Angela Wong furthers this point, noting that \\"Asianness and nationalism alike will easily fall into the old trap of orientalism, which fixes 'the Orient' in time and place\\"; this is especially oppressive to Asian women. Problems were also found within Western feminist theology which was accused of: # speaking from a tradition where Christianity was dominant, which was largely irrelevant for most Asian women # a tendency to universalize Western experiences as representative # being insufficiently radical ‚Äì it failed to consider the axes of colonialism, cultural imperialism, religious pluralism, and internalized colonialism # some displayed racist or ethnocentric orientations that essentialized Asian women  Stages  In the early stages of the late 1970s‚Äì1980s, Asian feminist theologians saw the need to stress the commonality of Asian women. There was a call to embrace their shared identity as Asian women first and foremost. Emphasis was placed on the shared and lived experiences of oppression, colonialism, and neo-colonialism and the theology of this stage was more reflective and descriptive than analytical. Grace Ji-Sun Kim In the 1990s, this gave way to the awareness of the dangers of generalizing experiences. Asian feminist theologians began to call to attention the diversity and wide range of lives and situations experienced by women across Asia. Turning to their own traditions and cultures, Asian feminist theologians began to look at these with a critical feminist consciousness, while at the same time identifying in them liberating and life-affirming aspects to emulate and draw upon. The third and present stage sees a huge range of diverse theories and subjects being engaged with. Christology was from the beginning a key issue of interest for Asian feminist theologians and this has remained so, however there are now works being done on subjects such as Mariology, sophia, soteriology, and ecclesiology. Theologians are engaging with a wider range of theories such as postcolonial theory, psychoanalysis, political feminist hermeneutics, and others. Additionally, other hallmarks of this stage include more work being done on the notion of hybrid identities by second- and third- generation immigrant Asian women such as Wonhee Anne Joh and Grace Ji-Sun Kim, as well as a shift in focus onto the oppression faced by Asian women in the Western world.  Sources  Chung Hyun Kyung In seeking a new theology, Asian feminist theologians have turned to traditional practices, myths, and motifs, while at the same time being aware of problematic elements. An example of this is detailed by Korean theologian Chung Hyun Kyung who talks about han-pu-ri as a way for Asian women to find healing. Chung describes han as coming from \\"the sinful interconnections of classism, racism, sexism, colonialism, neo- colonialism, and cultural imperialism which Korean people experience everyday\\". For her, this built-up han is imprisoning Korean women. The ritual of han-pu-ri, overseen mostly by female shamans, is a method of liberation that is especially helpful as it is \\"one of the few spaces where poor Korean women played their spiritual role without being dominated by male-centred religious authorities\\". Oral traditions also play an important role due to its central place in many Asian societies, with poems, songs, stories, and dance being seen as potential ways of doing theology.  Theology = Bible  Asian feminist theologians draw upon Biblical stories such as that of the Samaritan woman, the Syrophoenecian woman as well as the figure of Mary, the mother of Jesus who is seen as the first fully liberated human by Indonesian writer Marianne Katoppo.  God  Unlike some Western feminists, Asian feminist theologians have little problem with the language used to speak about God, or the gender of Jesus. Indeed, for some such as Virginia Fabella, the very fact that Jesus is male is advantageous. She writes, \\"among Asian women, the maleness of Jesus has not been a problem for we see it as 'accidental' to the salvific process. His maleness was not essential but functional. By being male, Jesus could more repudiate more effectively the male definition of humanity and show the way to a right and just male‚Äìfemale relationship\\". The Asian feminist understanding of God is holistic and ecological. This approach sees God in all life (Panentheism) and views God as the creative power that sustains life. There is an emphasis on relationality of humans, other life- forms and God. Chung Hyun Kyung states, \\"Asian women emphasize the importance of community in their theologies because only in community can humanity reflect God and fulfil the image of God\\". It also moves away from the dualism of Western approaches that insist on a divide between mind/body, nature/culture, male/female. Instead, God is seen to easily possess both masculine and feminine qualities. Padma Gallup of India claims that Western Christianity has lost this inclusive understanding as it is too \\"wrapped in layers of ponderous patriarchy, Zoroastrian dualism, Greek philosophy, and the ethics of the marketplace and morality of the dominant male of the Puritan tradition.\\" Quoted in .  Christology  For many Asian women, the images of Christ that were propagated during the colonial era are unhelpful. The notion of Jesus as Lord reinforced servility to colonial authorities, and the image of Jesus as the Suffering Servant encouraged passiveness and docility. Virginia Fabella writes, \\"Asian women have been 'lorded over' for centuries and all the major religions including Christianity have contributed to this sinful situation.\\" Likewise, Muriel Orevillo-Montenegro explains that \\"the Jesus of Asian women is the Asian Christ who accompanies them in their daily struggles for liberation from all forms of oppression and suffering. This Christ seeks to engage with religions, cultures, and indigenous spiritualities to make life flourish for every living being.\\" Instead, they have understood Jesus as a liberator, who has come to set people free both spiritually and from their earthly bondage of socio-economic oppression. Asian feminists have emphasized how Jesus sought out the poor and marginalized within society, and noted his ministry with women (; ; ; ; ) as well as his female disciples (; ; ; ). Other notions of Christ include a reworking of his suffering to mean that he is compassionate and deeply empathetic and understanding of the suffering faced by many Asian women; and an organic model of Christology as advocated by Kwok who looks at Jesus' use of metaphors from nature (; ; ).  Spirituality  Spirituality for many Asian feminist theologians involves both body and soul in harmony and focuses on the joyful celebration of life. Specifically, the female body is embraced and loved, reacting against traditions such as female infanticide and sex tourism that devalue female bodies. This spirituality is holistic and life-affirming, exhorting women's procreative power and emphasizing interconnection with all living things.  Sexuality  Asian feminist theologians see sexuality is an important part of spirituality. For some such as Elizabeth Dominguez, sensuality and erotic love is to be embraced as God has intended it to be the purest form of human communion. Reacting against traditional church teachings that inhibit the eroticism of women, for Asian feminist theologians, a woman's sensuality is something that is liberating and freeing, allowing them to feel deeply towards God and others.

Discovery Romano's star was first reported as one of eleven new variable stars in the Triangulum Galaxy. These were numbered from GR 282 to GR 292. GR 290 was described as a Hubble‚ÄìSandage variable, more commonly known now as a luminous blue variable (LBV). It was described as varying from photographic magnitude 16.5 to 17.8. The other ten stars were relatively common stars in our own galaxy, but the highly luminous GR 290 was a member of the M33 galaxy and came to be called Romano's star. A detailed follow-up study of the new rare type of variable showed that it was 17' from the centre of M33, on the outskirts of the galaxy near one of the spiral arms. On the photographic plates taken between 1960 and 1977, the star is seen to vary irregularly between photographic magnitude 16.5 and 17.8, with quiescent periods in 1960‚Äì1961 and 1974 onwards. A spectroscopic study near minimum brightness in 2003 confirmed the LBV nature of Romano's star and showed that the spectral type was Of/WN. It is listed in the Extragalactic Variable Stars catalogue as M33 V532. Variability Analysis of historical records show that Romano's star was likely quiescent from 1900 until five outbursts occurred between 1960 and 2010. The brightness is not constant during maximum but shows variations on a timescale of months. The third of the five outbursts was the brightest, peaking at magnitude 16.5. The minimum brightness in 2014 was the faintest ever recorded at below magnitude 18.7 and the star remained faint into 2016. It has been suggested that the sequence of outbursts is now complete. Spectrum The spectrum of GR 290 shows prominent emission lines of hydrogen and atomic helium, along with a broad complex of ionised nitrogen emission lines and weak ionised helium emission. There are also some faint absorption lines attributed to interstellar material, and some forbidden emission lines. C is detectable but much weaker than the nitrogen lines. The spectral type of Romano's star is that of a Wolf‚ÄìRayet star on the nitrogen sequence, but also with hydrogen. It varies in phase with the brightness changes, from WN8h‚Äì9h at minimum brightness to WN10h‚Äì11h at maximum. Although the spectral type changes, the colour of the star remains roughly constant, as measured by the B‚ÄìV and U‚ÄìB colour indices. Properties The effective temperature of Romano's star changes from about at minimum brightness to about at maximum brightness. The radius also changes from about at minimum to at maximum, so that the star is much larger and cooler when it is visually brightest. Typical behaviour for an LBV during these outbursts is for the bolometric luminosity to stay approximately constant, but Romano's star is one of several that have been shown to significantly change their luminosity. The luminosity increases from around at minimum to over at maximum. Romano's star is estimated to have a current mass of and to be losing mass at a rate of every 25,000‚Äì50,000 years. The mass loss is highest when the star is largest and brightest. Evolution Although Romano's star has a Wolf‚ÄìRayet spectrum, it is not a classical hydrogen-free star Wolf‚ÄìRayet star. It still shows about 70% more hydrogen than helium at the surface. It is estimated to be only four million years old and has not yet lost all of its outer envelope of hydrogen. Modelling the evolution of massive stars suggests that Romano's star started as a star, has experienced a relatively brief LBV stage after it left the main sequence, and is now losing the last of its hydrogen before becoming a more conventional Wolf‚ÄìRayet star.

The building corners have paneled pilasters rising to an entablature and a fully pedimented cornice. An open deck with balustrade extends most of the way across the front and beyond the left corner. The first floor interior originally consisted of three small chambers across the front, and a larger open chamber to the rear, which was used as a classroom. The main sanctuary is on the second floor, with original pews and other 19th-century features.Goebel-Bain, Michael (2016). NRHP nomination for Robinhood Free Meetinghouse; available by request from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission The church was built in 1856, to house Methodist and Congregationalist church groups. The downstairs area served as a vestry meeting space and classroom for religious instruction. The church was designed by Moses Riggs, member of the locally prominent Riggs family, and was built on land given by Herbert Low and Francis Low, Jr. The Congregationalists ceased use of the church in 1864, while the Methodist congregation continued to use it for another century. It has since passed into private ownership, and has recently been adapted for use as a restaurant.

As South Africa saw the end of political apartheid, the country experienced movement in the demographics of social class. Many native South Africans were able to get high paying jobs and raise themselves out of poverty. However, South Africa still remains one of the most unequal societies on the planet today. Though racial lines of the rich whites and poor blacks became less clear after the shift to democratization, inequality still exists on a major scale, and has shifted to the differences within the black community. Since South Africa became a democracy, those blacks that were more privileged or grew up in a better living environment have experienced higher incomes and social stability. The majority of such blacks are those who were lucky enough to live close enough to go to school in a white area when apartheid ended, and therefore received an education far superior to the status quo for the rest of the nation. However, the blacks who did not have such privilege remained poor, and little opportunity for social mobility exists. A good indicator of social mobility is opportunity and equality of education, as statistics show that there is a direct correlation between education level and income. The Government of South Africa has made massive investments in education. However, when examined more closely, it was found that these investments in education benefit the wealthiest of South Africans the most, and do very little to help the poor communities. Tests conducted in South African schools showed that 27% of 6th grade students in South Africa are illiterate. However, when schools are separated by regional wealth that number drops to just 4%, revealing a stark contrast between education for the rich and poor. Because of this large inequality of opportunity, it is difficult for a poor South Africans to raise themselves out of poverty. Though the opportunity exists, the chances are much lower for a poor South African to receive opportunity than a rich South African, revealing a trend of little social mobility. Some scholars argue that this lack of social mobility for the nations poor is further fostered by government funded housing. Since its transition to democracy, the South African government has made large investments in government funded housing. These government run housing projects are located in areas that receive the least amount of funding for education and welfare, ensuring that the uneducated and poor will remain uneducated and poor. A level of social mobility does exist among blacks who are able to attend schools in white areas, but with 76% of the total population being black combined with massive regional grouping of blacks, white schools are few and far between, and inaccessible to the poor. Perspectives on South African social mobility can vary. The topic of race has dominated South African politics for the last half century, and therefore, when looking at inequality and social mobility, people often turn to race as the determining variable. It is possible to argue that social mobility exists in South Africa, and it can be seen in the fact that the all the wealth and high status within the country was previously held by whites, whereas today, there are many natives who have been able to pull themselves out of oppression and into a status of income security and wealth. However, it is also clear that there is a large gap between those natives who have been able to achieve a level of success and those who have remained in poverty. It is in this gap where social mobility is hardly present, if at all. Statistically, those natives who were born to poor families and poor communities do not have the equality of opportunity to achieve success in South African society.

She led excavations in Perga and Side which resulted in the expansion of the Antalya Museum. Her restoration work on the Temple of Apollo in Side was noted for its significance to Turkish heritage. Her scientific work on the \\"Weary Hercules\\" statue in the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston formed the legal basis for return of the bust of the statue to the Antalya Museum to be reunited with the statue's base. The Antalya Women's Museum has an annual award named in her honour which recognizes the woman of the year. Early life Jale Ogan was born on 1 February 1914 in ƒ∞stanbul to Mesture Hanƒ±m and as their second daughter Her father was the curator and director of the ƒ∞zmir Archeology Museum for many years and later became the director of the Istanbul Archaeological Museum. During the beginning decades of the Turkish Republic, he brought transformation to curatorial work in the country by systematically cataloguing the holdings and utilizing laboratories to scientifically restore objects and artifacts. He also opened galleries to the public expanding museum collections and encouraged his daughter in her desire to study archaeology. After graduating from the Erenk√∂y Girls High School in 1934, her father helped her secure a scholarship to study abroad, since there was no opportunity for her to continue studies in Turkey. Studying in Germany, with the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation scholarship, Ogan began her archaeological training in Berlin, at the German Archaeological Institute. The following year, she was awarded a scholarship to continue studying by the Turkish government. Despite the war, Ogan was determined to complete her doctorate and though bombs regularly fell on the city, she took her thesis and notes into a bunker continuing to work. Ogan graduated in 1943 after completing her doctoral thesis, Kunstgeschichtliche Untersuchung der Opferhandlung auf r√∂mischen M√ºnzen (Examination of Art History in Sacrifice Rituals on Roman Coins), alongside . Career Ogan returned to Turkey 1943 and became an assistant to , Chair of Ancient History and Numismatics for the University of Istanbul. In 1944, she married Mustafa ƒ∞nan, a civil engineer and instructor at the Istanbul Technical University, and the following year gave birth to their son, H√ºseyin ƒ∞nan. She spent the next two years taking photographs of artifacts and organizing the archive at the university. In 1946, she worked with to found a chair of classical archaeology at Istanbul University, as previously the university had no independent archaeological department. That same year, she began excavations with Mansel on the site at Perga working on the Temple of Artemis. The following year, they began digs at Side, initially working on the site of the Temple of Apollo, continuing their excavations until 1966. During this period, in 1962, the conversion of one of the baths on the site into a museum was completed under ƒ∞nan's direction and the Antalya Museum had to be expanded twice to house the findings. ƒ∞nan began publishing articles in both German and Turkish on her studies of sculptures. The first was an evaluation of Roman portraits from the Anatolia region, Antalya b√∂lgesi Roma devri portreleri: R√∂mische Portr√§ts aus dem Gebiet von Antalya (Roman portraits from the area of Antalya, 1965) and the following year she published Roman and Early Byzantine Portrait Sculpture in Asia Minor with . In 1967, ƒ∞nan was put in charge of the excavations at Perga and that same year, a large group of bronze statues appeared in the United States with a murky provenance, but with claims of possible origin in south-west Anatolia. ƒ∞nan began working to try to verify the actual location of origin in 1973. Unlike other finds in which the sites were known and misappropriated pieces later appeared in museums, the bronzes were unique in that the pieces appeared in a museum but their place of origin was unknown. From 1970 to 1972, ƒ∞nan worked at a dig site in the ancient city of Cremna in the Pisidia region and then between 1972 and 1979 excavated at Seleucia along the Mediterranean coast north of Manavgat, uncovering the city agora, as well as several baths and the temple structure. Dated to the Hellenistic period, the agora was constructed in the Ionic Order and contained decorations depicting the Seven Sages of Greece as well as mosaics. She was appointed as a full professor at Istanbul University in 1974, and upon Mansel's death, the following year was elevated to the head of the archaeology department. In 1980, while excavating at Perga, ƒ∞nan uncovered the bottom half of a 2nd century AD copy of Lysippos' \\"Weary Heracles\\". Rumors at the dig had led them to a workman who was suspected of taking statuary, but no one suspected that the upper torso of the statue was stolen. The following year, the missing half surfaced in New York. The bottom half of the statue was displayed at the Antalia Museum and the upper half was displayed at MFA, after their 1982 acquisition of the piece. From 1981 to 1990, ƒ∞nan led restoration work on the Temple of Apollo at Side, conserving a significant monument of Turkey's cultural heritage. Though she retired from the university in 1983, ƒ∞nan continued to work, beginning excavations again in Perga at the Theater in 1985 continuing her work there until 1992. In 1990, ƒ∞nan uncovered the Sebasteion, or imperial cult temple, in a dig at Bubon, which she attributed as the place which had housed the bronze statues she had first heard of in 1967. Her findings were published in the book, Boubon Sebasteionu ve heykelleri √ºzerine son ara≈ütƒ±rmalar in 1994. The bronzes were said to have been brought to the Burdur Archaeological Museum with an unknown origin, but due to the unauthorized excavations reported at Bubon at that time and the similarities to artifacts found there, ƒ∞nan began her investigation at that location. From the looter's diary and examination of scattered pieces of arms, heads and torsos held in various collections worldwide, she confirmed that the building had inscriptions for fourteen statues. Though her attribution of seven statues to the Bubon site gained wide acceptance in archaeological circles, the scattered nature of the pieces and the unauthorized excavation of the statues have raised doubts by other researchers. In 1990, a journalist, √ñzgen Acar was attending an exhibition at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art and went to see the private collection of Shelby White and Leon Levy. He spotted the statue and thought that it looked familiar. After publishing photographs of the statue in the American art magazine Connoisseur, ƒ∞nan did a photo stitching of the bust portion and agreed with Acar that the two pieces were of the same statue. She was determined to retrieve the statue as part of Turkey's cultural heritage and made a plaster cast of the lower portion to prove that the two parts would fit together. ƒ∞nan, Engin √ñzgen, the General Director Monuments and Museums and students went to Boston with the cast to meet with experts and lawyers, but their results were rejected. At her own expense, ƒ∞nan made a second trip, with a plaster cast made by an American sculptor, which the Turkish government had hired, in 1992. The second cast conclusively proved the two parts were of the same statue, but the MFA continued to fight returning the piece to Turkey until 2011. Beginning in 1995, ƒ∞nan who had Parkinson's disease, curtailed her field work and focused her work on publishing. Works produced in this period included Toroslar‚Äôda Bir Antik Kent: Lyrbe? Seleukeia? (1998) and Perge'nin Roma devri heykeltra≈ülƒ±ƒüƒ± 1 (2000), which catalogued the finds made in Perga from 1946 to 1992. Death and legacy In 1989, in honor of ƒ∞nan's 75th birthday, a book, Festschrift f√ºr Jale Inan, was published by colleagues and friends in honor of her lifelong accomplishments. Prior to her death, on 26 February 2001, ƒ∞nan donated her books and compilations to the Antalya Museum. In her honor, the Antalya Women's Museum established the Woman of the Year Award, given annually to recognize women who have contributed to Turkish culture and the development of women.

She has contributed to the fields of cultural studies, ethnography, and feminist film theory, particularly in regards to star studies and examining the spectatorial response to film. She is a currently professor of Media and Cultural Studies and the director of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Arts and Languages (CIDRAL) at the University of Manchester.http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/Jackie.stacey/personaldetails She previously worked in the Department of Sociology at Lancaster University as a professor of women's studies and cultural studies. She has served as co- editor of Screen since 1994. As an author, she has been largely collected by libraries.  Education  Stacey received a Bachelor of Arts degree in European Studies in 1982 from the University of Sussex and a Master of Arts degree in Women's Studies in 1985 from the University of Kent. She received her doctorate in 1992 from the University of Birmingham.  Theory and Thought = Female Spectatorship and Homoerotic Desire  In her 1987 article \\"Desperately Seeking Difference,\\" Stacey posits that there is a very strong connection between lesbian films and films that feature female bonding and friendship. She argues that there is inherently a \\"homoerotic component\\" in films about women with intimate friendships, even if there is no explicit homosexual contact between the female characters. Stacey links this argument to her work in spectatorial theory by comparing the homoerotic way in which the female characters on screen interact with one another to the way the female spectators in the audience form a connection with the films' female stars. Stacey suggests that the way female spectators view the stars they see on screen must pertain to some element of desire, as their idealisation of the stars negates the concept of purely narcissistic identification. Rather than viewing the female spectatorial experience through the lens of either male desire or female identification, Stacey calls for a deconstruction of the binary and a more nuanced spectrum with which to explore female spectatorship. Jackie Stacey's theory of female spectatorship's relation with homoerotic desire has stemmed much academic debate. Opposition to Stacey's theory has been most notably come from Teresa de Lauretis. In contrast to Stacey, de Lauretis, a proponent of orthodox Freudianism, claims that the dichotomy between object libido and the desexualised ego libido that centres on narcissistic identification can not be combined or otherwise dismantled. While Stacey argues for the eroticisation of identification, de Lauretis very staunchly insists that the dichotomy be maintained.  The Future of Women's Studies  In 1992, along with Hilary Hinds and Ann Phoenix, Jackie Stacey co-edited Working Out: New Directions for Women's Studies, an anthology that attempted to answer the question of where women's studies belonged. Stacey and her co-editors were especially interested in addressing the ambiguities and uncertainties that exist in the field. The title reflects their claim that women's studies is still \\"working out\\" how to respond negotiate its marginal standing inside mainstream academia. In her written and editorial work, Stacey has expressed concern over whether or not women's studies's pursuit of academic legitimacy would diminish open political feminist debate. In regards to selecting texts to form a feminist canon, Stacey has warned that doing so runs the risk of creating a \\"hierarchy of knowledge\\" that may exclude the voice of the Other.  Summary of Academic Work  Stacey is noted for her work in film spectatorship analysis. In her book, Stargazing: Hollywood Cinema and Female Spectatorship (1993), Stacey surveyed the responses women had to the Hollywood starlets of the 1940s and 1950s, such as Doris Day and Rita Hayworth. Through examining letters the respondents sent to her, she examined the spectatorial reaction of the female viewers, an area of inquiry she claims has been much neglected in feminist film theory. With this study's focus on the female spectatorial experience to film and Hollywood mythology, Stacey pushes against the traditional cine-psych mode of analysis (using psychoanalysis as a tool for interpreting the text), a mode of analysis that emphasises meaning as exclusively governed by the text. Along with Annette Kuhn, Stacey co-edited Screen Histories: A \\"Screen\\" Reader (1999), an anthology of essays that address the concept of \\"history\\" in screen studies. The essays were originally published in academic journal of film and television studies Screen over the preceding twenty years. In Global Nature, Global Culture (2000), Stacey, along with Sarah Franklin and Celia Lury, addresses the problematic inherent masculinity of the theory of globalisation. Their argument against this gendered imbalance and their proposition for a field of globalist feminist cultural studies is situated around three case studies. The authors include and analyse cultural images, references, texts, and artworks that are widely distributed to Western audiences, such as The Body Shop, Benetton commercials, and Jurassic Park. While other works in globalisation theory have indeed touched on \\"how global forces shape and reshape landscapes of culture and nature,\\" few have engaged with it so extensively.

It includes a foreword by novelist Matthew Pearl and is dedicated to Sean Collier. Geeks & Greeks is set at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and locations in Boston, Cambridge, and the Quincy Quarries. The story was inspired by MIT's hacking culture and the writer's experiences with fraternity hazing. At MIT a hack is a clever, benign prank or unsanctioned public display or installation that requires technical sophistication to execute and often incorporates an offbeat sense of humor. Geeks & Greeks has been described as Good Will Hunting meets Animal House. Plot Geeks & Greeks is the story of Jim Walden, a brilliant and charming young man who wants desperately to become an astronaut. Unfortunately he gets kicked out of high school for a prank. After a viral video catches the attention of MIT's admission office he is offered a scholarship to MIT. At MIT Jim pledges Alpha Zeta Omicron (AZO), a raucous fraternity, and gets indoctrinated into MIT's hacking culture. Jim and his pledge brothers endure all manner of high-tech hazing at the hands of Luke Bardolf, a gruff AZO senior who is obsessed with pulling off the greatest hack at MIT. Jim befriends Dexter Garfinkel (the ultimate nerd and AZO's live-in problem set slave) and begins a romance with Natalie Taylor (the Shakespeare- loving receptionist at a fertility clinic). Other characters include Professor Neustadt (who mentors Jim and helps him understand the significance and meaning of hacks) and the Bridge Troll (a homeless man who Jim aids). When an elaborate prank goes wrong, MIT's Discipline Committee sanctions Jim and forces him to make restitution, leading Jim to Natalie's fertility clinic as a way to make money quickly. Meanwhile Jim and Luke engage in an escalating back-and-forth prank battle, which leads to a climactic showdown at the Quincy Quarries after Luke nearly kills Dexter with his recklessness. In the end Jim draws on his hacking prowess in a frantic race against time to prove to MIT that he deserves to be there, save his scholarship, make restitution with a bold gamble, exact revenge against Luke, win back Natalie, and inspire Dexter to revolt against his indentured servitude. Autobiographical and historical content Elements of Geeks & Greeks were inspired by hazing incidents Altes witnessed as an MIT student as well as actual hacks, such as: * hackers constructing a replica of a campus police car on top of MIT's Great Dome, * hackers creating a dorm room on top of the Great Dome, * hackers making the MIT President's office appear to vanish, * MIT's Alpha Tau Omega fraternity commandeering the Boston Sheraton's rooftop sign to make it spell \\"ATO\\" (their initials), and * MIT's Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity painting the smoot markers on the Harvard Bridge. The book contains 120 endnotes citing the real-life events that influenced the graphic novel. Reception Critical reception has been generally favorable. The Miami Herald called Geeks & Greeks a \\"funny, human story of struggle and redemption with believable characters in outrageous but plausible situations.\\" Library Journal called it an \\"amusing romp\\" and said its \\"inventive dialog effectively juxtaposes outrageousness with hyperacademic geekery, like the 'milliHelen' measure of beauty, the insult 'nanophallus,' and a football cheer based on pi.\\" The Post-Standard cited the \\"vast pool of knowledge\\" Altes drew on in creating a graphic novel that \\"sets out to entertain while also showing what the modern nerd is really like.\\" MIT's student newspaper The Tech called it \\"a compelling read, filled with jokes that will please anyone with nerdier sensibilities and stories that are sure to inspire young readers to apply to the Institute,\\" although they criticized the book for \\"racial and gender under-representation\\" among the characters. Geeks & Greeks has received positive reviews on the geek/comic culture websites FanboyNation.com, ForcesOfGeek.com, ForeverGeek.com, and ComicCrusaders.com.

Early life and education Jane Wright was born in Ontario in 1954. She attended Queens University in Kingston, Ontario. Her interest in entomology led her to the University of Guelph, Southern Ontario, the only university in Canada with an entomology department. At the University of Guelph, working on her master's degree Wright decided to study apple maggots but professor John Laing persuaded her to study ladybird beetles instead as not as much research had been done on them. Wright did much field work studying ladybird beetles, determining the conditions during the winter that made them most likely to survive. The conditions for research were difficult involving carrying packs of tools, traps and specimens through areas without roads. She dug traps of specimens out of frozen ground to recover them. After graduating from the University of Guelph Wright enrolled at Berkeley, California in the United States. At the time, no university in Canada offered a PhD program in entomology. Wright studied parasitic wasps in quarantine. She found that wasps chose their host scale insects in which to lay their eggs based on their size. If the wasp eggs were female they were most likely to survive in a larger host while male eggs were able to survive and develop in smaller hosts. Career Following her PhD, Wright worked with CSIRO-Australia researching dung beetles in Africa. The buffalo fly in both Africa and Australia is a pest to livestock, taking up to 20 blood-meals a day causing bleeding ulcerations. CSIRO-Australia was seeking a parasitic insect that could be imported from Africa to Australia to control the buffalo fly population. Dung beetles feed on the larvae of buffalo flies as they develop in animal dung and had already been identified as a possibility for controlling the buffalo fly‚Äôs population when Wright joined the CSIRO-Australia research team in Africa. There are over 250 species of dung beetles that feed on buffalo fly and use their bodies as parasitic hosts; identifying which species would best serve the purpose was the research that Wright continued. In researching the different beetles that grew in animal dung Wright came across species that had not yet been named. The specialists named this new small African species of beetle Aleochara wrightii after Wright. The CSIRO-Australia led dung beetle research in Africa went on for almost 20 years and Wright contributed to that research for more than two years. Those funding the research decided to change their priorities and Wright and her group were forced to pack up their research camp in Africa. Wright salvaged her research once back in Brisbane Australia and distributed imported dung beetles to Australia. They are making a positive impact on keeping the harmful population of buffalo flies under control today. Wright next found work again with CSIRO-Australia in their Division of Entomology as an insect ecologist/behaviorists in Canberra, Australia. She researched stored grain beetles and how they cause harm to grain kept in silos. Wright then began work for the Stored Grain Research Laboratory in Australia to control the warehouse beetle and its harmful impact on stored grains and stored grain commodities. The warehouse beetle is not indigenous to Australia and originally an attempt was made to eradicate them. Wright worked with other researchers to find that the warehouse beetle had spread from plants and silos with stored grain into the wild across Australia and that complete eradication was impossible. Wright and her team found the most effective amounts of heat and fumigants used in grain to control the warehouse beetle. Wright became the deputy head of the Stored Grain Research Laboratory. Wright was asked if she saw any discrimination in the workplace as a female scientist. She said that she encountered remarkably little, but during a time that she was applying for work during her final year at Berkeley a person at a conference told her that \\"a woman who had studied in California would never ever want to go to a remote part of Canada and work on insects in the forest.\\" Wright did not get an interview for the job the man was referring to. A year later at the same conference Wright derived \\"enormous satisfaction\\" by telling the same person about the job that she had taken working for CSIRO with dung beetles \\"in African game parks, and dodging lions and American Buffalo.\\" References Category:Living people Category:1954 births Category:Queen's University at Kingston alumni Category:University of Guelph alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Women entomologists Category:Canadian entomologists Category:Canadian women scientists Category:Australian women scientists Category:20th-century women scientists Category:21st-century women scientists ","title":"Jane Wright (entomologist)"},{"id":"52077929","text":"Eucalyptus aequioperta, commonly known as the Welcome Hill gum, is a mallee, sometimes a tree and is endemic to Western Australia. It has rough bark on the lower half of the trunk, lance-shaped leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and fifteen, white flowers and more or less cup-shaped fruit.E. aequioperta flower buds Description Eucalyptus aequioperta is a mallee or sometimes a tree growing to a height of or more, and forms a lignotuber. The bark is a dark grey colour, firm and flaky to fibrous over the lower half of the trunk and extending to large limbs. The bark becomes slightly tessellated on older trees and on higher branches is smooth, dull and pinkish grey to white. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, glossy and a similar green on both sides. The leaf blade is linear to narrow lance-shaped or curved, long and wide with a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of between seven and fifteen in leaf axils, the groups on a peduncle long, individual buds on a pedicel long. The buds are \\"egg-in-egg cup shaped\\" or spindle- shaped, long and wide. The operculum is long and equal in width or narrower than the floral cup. The stamens are white. Flowering has been observed in May and the fruit are cup-shaped to cone-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide. Taxonomy Eucalyptus aequioperta was first formally described by the botanists Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper in 1993 in the journal Nuytsia. The type specimen was collected by Brooker near Mount Walker, north of Hyden in 1985. According to Brooker and Hopper, the specific epithet (aequioperta) is \\"from the Latin aequi - equal and opertus - cover, referring to the operculum shape, in relation to the hypanthium\\". The proper classical Latin word for \\"equal\\" is however aequus.Lewis, C.T. & Short, C. (1879). A Latin dictionary founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin dictionary. Oxford: Clarendon Press. Francis Sharr noted that \\"the precise meaning is unclear\\". Eucalyptus aequioperta is part of the subgenus Symphyomyrtus section Dumaria in a sub-group of nine closely related species called series Ovulares. The rough barked members of this series include E. aequioperta, E. baudiniana, E. brachycorys, E. myriadena and E. ovularis and the smooth barked members include E. cyclostoma, E. cylindrocarpa, E. exigua and E. oraria. Distribution and habitat The Welcome Hill gum grows in red sand on sandhills in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions of Western Australia. It is found in an area between Corrigin in the west, Southern Cross and Coolgardie in the east but its distribution is not well known and may extend even further east.

Of particular note is his exchange with Galileo Galilei, regarding sunspots.  Biography  Welser belonged to a rich family of the old German nobility that had emerged in the city of Augsburg. His uncle Bartholomeus Welser was one of the originators of the family wealth; with the Fugger family he financed the imperial election of Charles V, whose counselor he became. He was a commercial leader in Portuguese spices and in the economic growth of Antwerp. He also had an economic relationship with the French crown. In 1528, Bartholomeus, who had outfitted a fleet to the Americas, took control of the colony of Venezuela, obtaining from the emperor the right to retain ownership of it via an annual payment. His descendants kept it until 1555, when Spain took control of Venezuela.AA.VV.,Biografia universale antica e moderna, 1831, p.176 At the age of 16, Mark was sent to Padua, where he studied for ten years. He traveled often to France, and stayed in Paris in 1572. He became duumvir of Augsburg in 1611, but was also distinguished for his scholarship and his writings.. He also traveled to Italy, and in 1612 in Rome, he was named a member of the Accademia dei Lincei; the following year, he was elected to the Accademia della Crusca.Mario Bagioli Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism, University of Chicago Press, 1993 Mark was familiar with the Italian language and interested in historical research, and in the study of Greek and Latin authors, whose dissemination he promoted by financing the publishing house \\"Ad Insignia Pinus\\". The most important of his many works is his , dealing with the early history of the Bavarians, which was translated into German by the author's brother Paul (died 1620). His collected works, under the title , were collected and published in 1682 with a biography of Mark by C. Arnold. Controversy regarding sunspots Christoph Scheiner observing sunspots In late 1611, the Jesuit Christoph Scheiner, a mathematics teacher at Ingolstadt, using the pseudonym Apelles latens post tabulam (Apelles hiding behind the painting), wrote three letters to Welser, claiming the discovery of sunspots. These, Scheiner held, could not be an alteration of the Sun, which according to Aristotelian doctrine was an incorruptible celestial body, but instead were stars interposed between Earth and the Sun, which by an optical illusion appeared to be on the solar surface. Welser, a patron of academics and strongly connected with the Jesuits, caused Scheiner's observations to be published, and asked Galileo for an opinion. Galileo responded to Welser, criticizing him for diffusing an erroneous theory, which Galileo identified as having Jesuit origin, of three satellites orbiting the Sun. Scheiner responded, this time openly sustaining his theory with the book De maculis solaribus [...] accuratior disquisitio. Galileo replied in December 1612 with a third letter to Welser in which he claimed that he, prior to Scheiner, had discovered sunspots. In 1613, under the auspices of the Accademia dei Lincei, Galileo published Istoria e dimostrazioni intorno alle macchie solari e loro accidenti (\\"History and demonstration regarding sunspots and their behavior\\"), confirming that sunspots were present, disappearing and reforming, on the corruptible surface of the Sun, which with reasonable probability drew them along with its rotation.William Shea, La Rivoluzione scientifica: i protagonisti.

The language was designed and developed from the ground-up by Paul Longtine. Written in C, Toi was created with the intent to be an educational experience and serves as a learning tool (or toy, hence the name) for those looking to familiarize themselves with the inner-workings of a programming language.  Specificationhttp://dev.nanner.co/language/file/doc/SPECIFICATION.html = Types  0 VOID - Null, no data 1 ADDR - Address type (bytecode) 2 TYPE - A \`type\` type 3 PLIST - Parameter list 4 FUNC - Function 5 OBJBLDR - Object builder 6 OBJECT - Object/Class 7 G_PTR - Generic pointer 8 G_INT - Generic integer 9 G_FLOAT - Generic double 10 G_CHAR - Generic character 11 G_STR - Generic string 12 S_ARRAY - Static array 13 D_ARRAY - Dynamic array 14 H_TABLE - Hashtable 15 G_FIFO - Stack  Runtime  Runtime context definition = The runtime context keeps track of an individual threads metadata, such as: * The operating stack ** The operating stack where current running instructions push/pop to. ** refer to STACK DEFINITION * Namespace instance ** Data structure that holds the references to variable containers, also proving the interface for Namespace Levels. ** refer to NAMESPACE DEFINITION * Argument stack ** Arguments to function calls are pushed on to this stack, flushed on call. ** refer to STACK DEFINITION, FUNCTION DEFINITION * Program counter ** An interface around bytecode to keep track of traversing line- numbered instructions. ** refer to PROGRAM COUNTER DEFINITION This context gives definition to an 'environment' where code is executed. = Namespace definition = A key part to any operational computer language is the notion of a 'Namespace'. This notion of a 'Namespace' refers to the ability to declare a name, along with needed metadata, and call upon the same name to retrieve the values associated with that name. In this definition, the namespace will provide the following key mechanisms: * Declaring a name * Assigning a name to a value * Retrieving a name's value * Handle a name's scope * Implicitly move in/out of scopes The scope argument is a single byte, where the format is as follows: NamespaceScope 0000000 0 Scopes are handled by referencing to either the Global Scope or the Local Scope. The Local Scope is denoted by '0' in the scope argument when referring to names, and this scope is initialized when evaluating any new block of code. When a different block of code is called, a new scope is added as a new Namespace level. Namespace levels act as context switches within function contexts. For example, the local namespace must be 'returned to' if that local namespace context needs to be preserved on return. Pushing 'Namespace levels' ensures that for every n function calls, you can traverse n instances of previous namespaces. For example, take this namespace level graphic, where each Level is a namespace instance: Level 0: Global namespace, LSB  '1'. Level 1: Namespace level, where Local Level is at 1, LSB  '0'. When a function is called, another namespace level is created and the local level increases, like so: Level 0: Global namespace, LSB  '1'. Level 1: Namespace level. Level 2: Namespace level, where Local Level is at 2, LSB  '0'. Global scope names (LSB  1 in the scope argument) are persistent through the runtime as they handle all function definitions, objects, and names declared in the global scope. The \\"Local Level\\" is at where references that have a scope argument of '0' refer to when accessing names. The Namespace argument refers to which Namespace the variable exists in. When the namespace argument equals 0, the current namespace is referenced. The global namespace is 1 by default, and any other namespaces must be declared by using the = Variable definition = Variables in this definition provide the following mechanisms: * Provide a distinguishable area of typed data * Provide a generic container around typed data, to allow for labeling * Declare a set of fundamental datatypes, and methods to: ** Allocate the proper space of memory for the given data type, ** Deallocate the space of memory a variables data may take up, and ** Set in place a notion of ownership For a given variable V, V defines the following attributes V -> Ownership V -> Type V -> Pointer to typed space in memory Each variable then can be handled as a generic container. In the previous section, the notion of Namespace levels was introduced. Much like how names are scoped, generic variable containers must communicate their scope in terms of location within a given set of scopes. This is what is called 'Ownership'. In a given runtime, variable containers can exist in the following structures: A stack instance, Bytecode arguments, and Namespaces The concept of ownership differentiates variables existing on one or more of the structures. This is set in place to prevent accidental deallocation of variable containers that are not copied, but instead passed as references to these structures. = Function definition = Functions in this virtual machine are a pointer to a set of instructions in a program with metadata about parameters defined. = Object definition = In this paradigm, objects are units that encapsulate a separate namespace and collection of methods. = Bytecode spec = Bytecode is arranged in the following order: , , , Where the is a single byte denoting which subroutine to call with the following arguments when executed. Different opcodes have different argument lengths, some having 0 arguments, and others having 3 arguments.  Interpreting Bytecode Instructions  A bytecode instruction is a single-byte opcode, followed by at maximum 3 arguments, which can be in the following forms: * Static (single byte) * Name (single word) * Address (depending on runtime state, usually a word) * Dynamic (size terminated by NULL, followed by (size)*bytes of data) ** i.e. FF FF 00 <0xFFFF bytes of data>, ** 01 00 <0x1 bytes of data>, ** 06 00 <0x6 bytes of data>, etc. Below is the specification of all the instructions with a short description for each instruction, and instruction category:  Opcode  Keywords: TOS - 'Top Of Stack' The top element TBI - 'To be Implemented' S<[variable]> \\\\- Static Argument. N<[variable]> \\\\- Name. A<[variable]> \\\\- Address Argument.

A list of TBI primitive subroutines providing methods to tweak objects this bytecode set cannot touch. Uses argstack.  Compiler/Translator/Assembler  Lexical analysis = Going from code to bytecode is what this section is all about. First off an abstract notation for the code will be broken down into a binary tree as so: /\\\\ / \\\\ / \\\\ node> can be an argument of its parent node, or the next instruction. Instruction nodes are nodes that will produce an instruction, or multiple based on the bytecode interpretation of its instruction. For example, this line of code: int x = 3 would translate into: def /\\\\ / \\\\ / \\\\ / \\\\ / \\\\ int set /\\\\ /\\\\ / \\\\ / \\\\ null 'x' 'x' null /\\\\ / \\\\ null 3 Functions are expressed as individual binary trees. The root of any file is treated as an individual binary tree, as this is also a function. The various instruction nodes are as follows: * def ** Define a named space in memory with the type specified *** See the 'TYPES' section under 'OVERVIEW' * set ** Set a named space in memory with value specified  Going from Binary Trees to Bytecode  The various instruction nodes within the tree will call specific functions that will take arguments specified and lookahead and lookbehind to formulate the correct bytecode equivalent.

Of the abbey, only the church, dedicated to St Blaise, and a small monastic apartment remain. History Originally the site had a chapel dedicated to Santa Maria inter rivoira (or between the rivers), since it was located between the rivers Tenna and Tennacola. A Benedictine abbey was founded in 1030, and consecrated in 1059. The dedication to St Blaise did not arise till the 15th century. The first two centuries of the abbey were prosperous, but it then fell into decline till it was abandoned by the mid-13th century. The Romanesque-style abbey church, built with local stone, has remained as a local oratory dedicated to the Virgin. It has a narrow nave leading to a flat apse wall with two narrow windows. The fa√ßade has a single high oculus with a rounded portal. The portal has an inscription from 1117, noting some repairs which appear to have reduced the size of the church. The apse and nave walls have fresco remnants from the 15th century, attributed respectively to Giovanni di Corraduccio and Matteo da Gualdo. The crypt remains relatively intact, supported by sturdy simple columns.Cultural Tourism in the Province of Macerata , entry on abbey, by Fondazione della Cassa di Risparmio della Provincia di Macerata.

It affected approximately 100 km (62 miles) of the fault, from the San Francisco Peninsula to the Santa Cruz Mountains. It was a strong earthquake, with an estimated moment magnitude of 6.8 to 7.2, making it one of the largest known earthquakes in California. The region was lightly populated at the time, although structural damage was reported in San Francisco, Oakland, and Monterey. It is unknown whether there were fatalities. Based on geological sampling, the fault created approximately 1.5 meters (5.0 feet) of slip. For years, another large earthquake was said to have occurred two years earlier on June 10, 1836 along the Hayward fault; however, this is now believed to be referring to the 1838 San Andreas earthquake. There is no evidence a large earthquake hit the region in 1836. Preface During the 1830s in California, the largest of the few settlements usually contained no more than several hundred individuals. This is true even for the area between the San Francisco Peninsula and south to the Santa Clara Valley. Indians kept no records and communications between the villages was poor. There were no local newspapers and no correspondents from news agencies in the distant United States. Beginning in 1833, the secularization of the Spanish missions brought an end to the once plentiful and dominant source of information in the study of previous earthquakes, and other Mexican sources during this period were also lacking. The California Gold Rush ushered in a host of changes, including the startup of newspapers in the Sierra Nevada and the San Francisco Bay Area. These records were tapped later on by seismologists in their study of earthquakes in the area. The lack of archives made work difficult for seismologists preparing earthquake catalogs or those involved in creating seismic hazard and risk estimates. The science of seismology was still many decades in the future and no measuring equipment existed to aid in the recording and documentation of earthquakes. Had there been equipment available to use in the study, there were still no scientists in the area to perform the work. Instruments capable of detecting earthquakes that were designed by John Milne became available by 1896, but it was not until the Wood-Anderson seismograph was developed in 1926 that instruments began to be used in widespread fashion in California. Details that made their way into the earthquake catalogs showed that the period 1836‚Äì1840 was one of the most active on record. Tectonic setting The San Andreas Fault SAF system is a network of active right-lateral strike-slip faults that form a portion of a complex and diffuse transform type plate boundary. The zone of deformation between the Pacific and North American plates extends east into the Basin and Range Province of Eastern California and western Nevada. The faults span on and off shore along the California portion of the Pacific Rim, and near San Diego they are about wide. In the area near San Francisco Bay, the extent of the various fault strands are limited to about . This system of faults terminates in the north at the Mendocino Triple Junction where the north-northwest trending SAF meets the east trending Mendocino Fracture Zone and the Cascadia subduction zone. It terminates in the south in a more gradual fashion at the Salton Sea where displacement transitions to a series of transform faults and spreading centers along the Gulf of California Rift Zone. The northern part of the SAF consists of four main sections between the northern end of the Central part (the San Juan Bautista section) and the Menocino Triple Junction. These are known as the, Santa Cruz Mountains (or Loma Prieta), Peninsula, North Coast and Offshore sections, going from south to north. All these sections ruptured during the 1906 earthquake. Earthquake history The history of earthquakes along the northern part of the SAF relies on paleoseismic investigations before about 1776, when the first missions were founded in this part of California. A series of earlier events have been identified, the most recent of which occurred in the time interval 1660‚Äì1780 with an estimated rupture length of greater than 250 km and apparently affected the Offshore, North Coast and Peninsular sections of the fault. Since 1776 possible events on the fault include earthquakes in 1836, 1838, 1839, 1865, 1890 and 1906. The 1836 event is no longer thought to have been a large earthquake and it remains uncertain which fault was ruptured. The 1839 event is now accepted as misreporting of the 1838 earthquake. The 1865 event is only known to have affected the Santa Cruz Mountains, but is interpreted to be a reverse fault type earthquake not on the SAF itself. The 1890 earthquake is thought to be a result of rupture along the Santa Cruz Mountains section, with an estimated magnitude in the range 6.0‚Äì6.3. There has been no large earthquake on the northern part of the SAF since 1906. The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake was another reverse fault type event. Damage The damage associated with this earthquake is quite poorly documented, relying on relatively few written accounts and most of these were only recorded well after the event. Effects were reported from as far north as the northern end of the San Francisco Peninsula and as far as Monterey in the south. On the peninsula, the walls of some buildings in the Presidio were cracked and the walls of the Mission San Francisco Dolores were badly damaged. Across the other side of the bay, large fissures were reported at \\"Oakland valley\\" (near the waterfront at Oakland). An adobe house was destroyed at San Leandro and a large landslide was seen in the nearby hills. The walls of the mission buildings at both San Jos√© and Santa Clara were badly affected and a house collapsed in San Jose town. At Woodside adobe buildings were badly cracked and there are reports of the \\"ground (moving) in waves like the ocean\\". An open fissure was also described to extend from near Lone Mountain to the Santa Clara mission. Many trees were uprooted and thrown sideways, something that was also observed during the 1906 earthquake. At Santa Cruz reports shortly after the earthquake of buildings in disrepair may be a result of the earthquake and at Monterey some adobe walls were damaged and crockery and glassware broken. The age of major rockfalls in the Sierra Nevada that are thought to be seismically triggered have been investigated using lichenometry. Four main groups of ages were identified as 1817, 1837, 1857 and 1909, all with an uncertainty of 10 years and presumed to be associated with the major San Andreas earthquakes of 1812, 1838, 1857 and 1906. Rockfalls dated as 1837 were found to be equally as abundant as those dated 1857 and 1909, suggesting that the effects on the Sierra Nevada range was similar for all three events. Earthquake Due to the paucity of contemporary observations of this earthquake, there is significant uncertainty about the time and date, the magnitude, the maximum intensity and the exact portion of the fault that ruptured. The date is not known precisely, other than that the earthquake occurred in late June, 1838 and that the time was shortly after midday. The magnitude has been estimated from the size of the affected area, the maximum magnitude and the rupture length/displacement. This gives a magnitude range of 6.8‚Äì7.5. The maximum estimated intensity is at least VII‚ÄìVIII (very strong to severe) on the Modified Mercalli intensity scale, based on contemporary reports of damage to mission buildings in Santa Clara, San Francisco and San Jose, although it may have reached IX (violent). The description of the earthquake at Woodside, coupled with the report of a probable surface rupture in the same area suggests that some, if not all, of the Peninsula section ruptured. This is further supported by the interpretation of a paleoseismic investigation at Filoli, north of Woodside. The degree of shaking at Monterey, which is interpreted to be similar to that in the 1906 earthquake, has been used to support rupture along part, if not all, of the Santa Cruz Mountains section of the fault. The maximum suggested rupture length is 140 km, assuming that both sections of the fault ruptured completely. The possibility of rupture extending into the Santa Cruz Mountains has been investigated by paleoseismic techniques, particularly trenching across the fault at a series of localities, Grizzly Flat, Hazel Dell, Mill Canyon and Arano Flat. Initial results from Grizzly Flat found no evidence for the 1838 event, but the dating of the horizons have been re-evaluated and rupture associated with the 1838 earthquake is now thought to be consistent with observations at all four sites, suggesting a minimum rupture length on this section of the fault as 14 km. The displacement during the 1838 earthquake has been estimated at three of the Santa Cruz Mountain paleoseismic sites and at Filoli, covering 83 km of the rupture length. The values are; Filoli 1.6¬±0.7 m, Hazel Dell 1.5 m, Mill Canyon 1.0 m and Arano Flat 1.0 m. Assuming a total rupture length of 100 km, this gives a magnitude range of 6.8‚Äì7.2. The likely rupture extent has also been estimated by looking at stress transfer following the 1838 event. This analysis is more consistent with a rupture of 75 km in terms of subsequent earthquakes on the Santa Cruz Mountains section in 1865 and 1989. Aftershocks A contemporary account mentions many aftershocks, continuing for at least 2 and a half months until the writer left the area. Some larger aftershocks in 1840 and 1841 have also been attributed to the 1838 earthquake with magnitudes of about M 6 and epicenters near San Juan Bautista, supporting an extension of the 1838 rupture into the Santa Cruz Mountains.

The remaining thirty passengers were injured, as was the truck driver, Bruce Guilford. Investigation and trial Immediately following the accident, the National Transportation Safety Board sent a disaster crew to investigate the crash. The report established that both drivers had been seriously sleep-deprived and that Guilford had falsified his driver logs to conceal his having driven more than the maximum number of hours without rest. He had fallen asleep and his truck had remained stationary after the highway reopened following a temporary closure; Vides, an undiagnosed diabetic who had also had very little sleep in the days before the accident, had not reacted in time to avoid colliding with the truck. The bus also had two substandard tires and was not equipped with seat belts.

In addition he is a two time Badwater Ultramarathon champion and the 5th fastest North American, all-time, at the 24-hour run, covering 163.5 miles (an average pace of 8:48 per mile). Coast-to-coast run On September 12, 2016, he set out to break the record for the United States coast-to-coast (3,100 mile) run, starting in San Francisco City Hall ending in New York City, City Hall. The previous record was 46 days, eight hours and 36 minutes, set in 1980 by Frank Giannino Jr. Frank noted that he felt \\"nostalgic\\" watching Pete break his record and commented that he was impressed with how fast Pete was running, nine and a half minutes per mile. Frank traversed America much slower, often walking, during his record, but only slept 6 hours a night, which allowed him to cover similar ground at the much slower pace of 11 plus minutes per mile. Throughout Pete's crossing, he would gather local runners to join him promoting health and fitness. During his attempt he faced many hardships including snow storms, 35 mile per hour winds, and a major motor accident destroying his support vehicle (which provided Pete food and hydration). Several other ultramarathon runners have attempted to break the over 30 year old record, but have failed. A recent attempt by Robert Young was plagued by allegations of cheating, although Young didn't finish the distance anyway. To emphasize accountability, so there was no questions about the legitimacy of the record, Pete ran with a satellite transceiver which records his exact location at all times. In addition, Pete wore two GPS watches‚Äîin case one failed‚Äîand his team gathered witness signatures, took videos and photos, and assembled media reports daily.

Fischl Jr. (October 25, 1926 ‚Äì October 12, 2016) was an American U.S. Air Force colonel and politician. In 1966, Fischl, an Air Force pilot with the 433rd Tactical Fighter Squadron during the Vietnam War, was awarded the Silver Star, the U.S. military's third-highest decoration for valor in combat, \\"for gallantry in connection with military operations\\" for his role in an airstrike conducted in North Vietnam on September 3, 1966. Fischl later served as the Mayor of Allentown, Pennsylvania, from 1978 until 1982. Biography=Early life and education Fischl was born and raised in Allentown, Pennsylvania, to Frank R. Fischl, Sr. and Helen (n√©e Gehringer) Fischl. He graduated from Allentown High School (now called William Allen High School) in 1945. In 1947, Fischl entered the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. He played as a starting halfback on the Army Black Knights football team, where he was briefly coached by Vince Lombardi. He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 1951 and entered the United States Air Force. Fischl would later graduate from the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (now called the Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy) and earned his MBA from Syracuse University. U.S. Air Force Fischl, an Air Force pilot, flew combat missions in both the Korean War and the Vietnam War. On September 3, 1966, then-Major Fischl, a member of the 433rd Tactical Fighter Squadron based in Thailand, took part in an airstrike in North Vietnam. He was awarded the Silver Star on October 18, 1966, \\"for gallantry in connection with military operations\\" for his role in the September 3rd mission. According to the Silver Star citation, \\"On that date, Major Fischl conducted a night strike on a vital supply and storage area of the hostile force in a highly defended area. With complete disregard for his own safety, Major Fischl continued the attack in the face of intense defenses to deliver ordnance on the target, completely destroying the target. By his gallantry and devotion to duty, Major Fischl has reflected great credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.\\" In addition to his Silver Star, Fischl was also awarded two Distinguished Flying Crosses, eleven Air Medals, two Service stars, and the Legion of Merit. His final posting was as the Director of Safety for the Air Force's European division. Fischl retired from the U.S. Air Force with the rank of colonel in 1974. Political career In 1977, Fischl, a Republican, announced his candidacy for Mayor of his native Allentown, Pennsylvania, after friends encouraged him to run for the office. He narrowly defeated incumbent Mayor Joe Daddona, a Democrat, by just 121 votes in the 1977 mayoral general election. As mayor, Fischl introduced a series of tax breaks for businesses and established tax abatement zones, which were intended to encourage property development. Projects which were developed as a result of Fischl's tax breaks included the present day Wells Fargo corporate offices (formerly Wachovia) and the downtown Crown Plaza Hotel. Frank Fischl underwent quadruple bypass surgery while in office, which many believed contributed to his decision not to seek a second term in the 1981 election. He was succeeded by former Mayor Joe Daddona, who regained the office in 1982. In 1984, Pennsylvania Governor Dick Thornburgh appointed Fischl to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, where he served as a member from 1984 until 1991. Frank Fischl died in Allentown on October 12, 2016, at the age of 89. He was survived by his wife of 41 years, Anne L. (Eckert) Fischl; his two daughters, and his stepdaughter. He was buried in Grandview Cemetery in South Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania.

Superior Court (Decker), 41 Cal. 4th 1 (2007), is a criminal case decided by the Supreme Court of California that distinguished between solicitation and attempt.Criminal Law - Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012, Wolters Kluwer Law & Business; John Kaplan (law professor), Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder, , Background Decker searched out, asked, and later met with and paid an assassin to murder Decker's sister. After Decker made elaborate preparations, Decker had his final meeting with the assassin. \\"The assassin said, 'I want you to know, once I leave, its done. So you sure you want to go through with it?' Decker replied, 'I am absolutely, positively, 100 percent sure,'\\" then Decker handed over the money.\\" The assassin was an undercover detective wearing a recording device. Decker admitted he solicited murder, but denied he attempted murder, arguing that solicitation and attempt are not identical, with attempt having a standard of being much closer to the act intended to cause the consummation of the crime. The trial court agreed, and the attempt charge was dismissed for lack of evidence per its understanding of the law on elements of an attempt charge. The prosecution appealed and the California Supreme Court reinstated the attempt charge. The court reasoned agreed that solicitation and attempt are different, and that solicitation does not imply attempt, the latter requiring a finding of greater proximity to fruition of the crime. But the court found that a jury might find the solicitation to have occurred at an earlier request to do the murder, and additionally find attempt at the time of the passing of the money. Opinion of the Court The Supreme Court wrote: ::\\"Although Decker did not himself point a gun at his sister, he did aim at her an armed professional who had agreed to commit the murder... The solicitation is complete once the request is made... In this case the solicitation was complete early in Decker's first conversation with [the assassin] when he asked [the assassin] to kill [Decker's sister]... But the People do not contend that this request was sufficient to prosecute Decker for attempted murder. They argue instead that the solicitation, in combination with Decker's subsequent conduct... that Decker put this plan into operation no later than the point... at which he... paid [the assassin] $5,000... ::\\"The issue is not whether solicitation alone is sufficient to establish an attempt, but whether a solicitation to commit murder, combined with a completed agreement to hire a professional killer and the making of a downpayment under that agreement, can establish probable cause to believe Decker attempted to murder... downpayment on a contract to murder... makes the object of the contract 'closer to fruition'.\\" References Category:2007 in United States case law Category:Attempt ","title":"People v.

He was born in Tampa, Florida, and grew up in Hampton, Georgia, a small town approximately south of Atlanta. Music career Showing an early interest in music, Alan's mother brought home an acoustic guitar when he was 6 years old. He began learning songs he heard on the radio by ear. Other instruments he plays include piano, drums, bass guitar, banjo, and mandolin. In 2010, he moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, to expand his musical career. After filtering through several local bands, Josh found his niche in 2014 when he joined up with the Sin City Sinners, leading the vocals for the band that included members Brent Muscat (Faster Pussycat), Scott Griffin (RATT and L.A. Guns), Michael ‚ÄúDoc‚Äù Ellis (RATT, Love/Hate, and Todd Kerns and the Anti-Stars), and Blas Elias (Slaughter). In March 2015, RATT drummer Bobby Blotzer guested with the Sinners. Blotzer asked Josh and fellow Sinners' members Doc and Scott to join him in forming a new version of RATT. Josh toured with Blotzer's version of RATT while continuing as the singer for the Sin City Sinners. February 14, 2016, the Sinners released the album Let It Burn. On February 19, 2016, Josh announced his departure from the Sin City Sinners in order to work full-time with Blotzer's version of RATT. During this time, he toured world-wide with Blotzer's version of RATT as lead vocalist for the American Made tour, performing throughout the United States, in Canada, and the U.K. On January 23, 2017, Josh resigned from RATT to pursue his own musical career.

The court had interpreted the meaning of a broad swath of surveillance and cybersecurity laws without public disclosure, thereby creating a body of FISA court common law as precedent for subsequent cases, and which provides legal parameters for restricting and allowing actual surveillance practices. Unlike most other legal proceedings in the United States, the controversial Fisa court operates in secret for reasons of national security. From 2001 thorough 2015 it made a series of opinions that established a legal foundation (precedent) for expanding the government's surveillance activities. Among the opinions sought is that which interprets the original Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, in hopes it will expose an alleged Yahoo! program to scan large numbers of emails without a search warrant, possibly required by the 4th Amendment of the United States Constitution. Critics of the Fisa court, like United States Senator Ron Wyden (Oregon) have said these classified rulings are a body of \\"secret law\\" which throws away congressionally enacted privacy restrictions. The United States executive branch, and others, respond that US surveillance practices and proceedings must be kept in complete secrecy for national security reasons. The USA Freedom Act of 2015 mandates that the Fisa court release \\"novel\\" interpretations of the law (which thereby set precedent for future authority and cases), but does not clearly mandate retroactive disclosure. The ACLU argued that meaningful democratic debate and decisions about surveillance and cybersecurity cannot occur without the release of the precedent setting decisions prior to 2015.

Anna was presumably named after her father's aunt. There is little information of her life. The Muscovite custom at the time dictated the ideal life of a Russian princess as a cloistered seclusion from the world; as they were not permitted to marry a non-Orthodox nor a partner below their social status, and there were no Orthodox Kingdoms other than Russia at the time, daughters of the tsar were expected never to marry, nor have any contact with men outside of the family during their life.Massie, Robert K., Peter the Great: his life and world, Abacus, London, 1995[1980] This necessitated a life secluded with an all- female staff in the imperial terem (Russia); the tsarevna's attended church and even official state processions covered by screens, and made their pilgrimages to convents in covered sleighs and wagons, as was in fact the custom for all Russian noblewomen at the time.Massie, Robert K., Peter the Great: his life and world, Abacus, London, 1995[1980] Tsarevna Anna's life seem to have answered to this ideal of seclusion. As was required of her, she stayed unmarried. It is known that she was among those accompanying her sister-in-law tsaritsa Maria when the court was evacuated during the Moscow Plague of 1654. She was known as a supporter of her niece Sofia Alekseyevna of Russia and her reign. In 1689, when Sophia was deposed by tsar Peter the Great, Foy de la Neuville reported that Sophia sent her sister Tsarevna Marfa Alekseyevna of Russia and her aunts Tsarevna Anna Mikhailovna and Tsarevna Tatyana Mikhailovna to mediate.

Biography Tatyana was born the daughter of Tsar Michael of Russia and Eudoxia Streshneva, and the sister of Tsar Aleksei I of Russia. In contemporary Muscovite custom, Russian princesses were completely secluded from the world outside of the women's quarters of the terem, not allowed contact with men nor allowed to marry. Tatyana followed these rules, but she was also able to exert some degree of influence at court. She was known as a supporter of the reforms of Patriarch Nikon of Moscow. She had a good relationship with her brother tsar Alexei. Sophia's regency During the regency of her niece Sophia, she reportedly exercised some degree of influence at court, where she was treated as the senior female member at court in etiquette matters and given precedence by regent Sophia before the dowager Tsaritsa Natalya. When Sophia was deposed by tsar Peter the Great in 1689, Foy de la Neuville reported that Sophia sent her sister, Tsarevna Marfa, and aunts, Anna and Tatyana, to mediate. Tatyana tried to mediate and prevent Peter from imprisoning her niece Tsarevna Marfa in a convent, but without success; she lost her influence as Peter's reforms progressed society from the old way and the old court.

The 4% tax would be on top of the current 6% state sales tax, resulting in a total of 10% in taxes charged on all prepared meals. The referendum was voted on by Fairfax County residents in the general election on November 8, 2016. The referendum was rejected by voters in by a margin of 56%‚Äì44%.Fairfax County votes down proposed meals tax History A similar meals tax proposal was put to a referendum in 1992, and was defeated by a margin of 58%‚Äì42%. The proposal for a meals tax in Fairfax County has been debated for years; the most recent effort in 2012 failed to get the question on the ballot. In 2014, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors formed a task force to explore the issue. On June 7, 2016, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors voted 8‚Äì2 to place the question on the ballot in the November 2016 general election. Ballot question The question on the ballot will read as follows: > \\"For the purpose of reducing dependence on real estate taxes, shall the > Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County, Virginia, be authorized to levy a > tax on prepared food and beverages, otherwise known as a meals tax, as > allowed by Virginia Code ¬ß 58.1‚Äì3833, at a rate not to exceed four percent > (4%) of the amount charged for prepared food and beverages (which, based > upon state law, is applicable only to sales outside the town of Clifton, and > towns of Herndon and Vienna that have already implemented a meals tax)? The > revenues generated shall be dedicated to the following purposes: 70 percent > of the net revenues to Fairfax County Public Schools. 30 percent of the net > revenues to County services, capital improvements and property tax relief.\\" Arguments=In favor Supporters of the meals tax say it would give the county a new source of revenue and reduce its dependence on real estate taxes. It would generate an estimated $99 million in revenue per year, according to the county. Supporters say the money is needed to fund schools after several years of budget cuts. Fairfax County Board of Supervisors chairman Sharon Bulova wrote in an October editorial that the 70% designated for county schools would be used primarily for teachers' salaries, and pointed to similar meals taxes in neighboring counties and cities. Prominent supporters of the meals tax include The Washington Post editorial board, Fairfax County Board of Supervisors chairman Sharon Bulova, and Fairfax County School Board chairman Pat Hynes. Against Opponents of the meals tax say it would unfairly affect low-income and middle-income families, and negatively impact tourism. They say that it would cause decreased tipping, devastating waiters who rely on tips to make a living. They also point out that restaurants only make 3‚Äì4% in profit, and the meals tax would hurt small business owners. Springfield District Supervisor Pat Herrity said in an October forum that the answer to county budget problems is to address spending issues, not create a new tax. Prominent opponents of the meals tax referendum include Fairfax-based Great American Restaurants, Clyde's Restaurant Group, the Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce.

This formation was assigned to the Volkhov Front near Leningrad, toiling through the so- called \\"Rat's War\\" in the wooded swamps of that region and taking significant casualties in the encirclement of its 2nd Shock Army near Lyuban in early 1942. In January 1943, it helped to lead the partial raising of the German siege of Leningrad in Operation Iskra, distinguishing itself sufficiently to be redesignated as the 64th Guards Rifle Division. Well over a year later a second 327th Rifle Division was formed and was also moved to the Leningrad region where it took part in the offensive that drove Finland from the war, then spent the first months of 1945 clearing German forces from the coasts of the Baltic States and containing the German forces trapped in Courland. 1st Formation The division first formed on September 1, 1941 in the Oryol Military DistrictWalter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 78 at Voronezh, right alongside the 329th Rifle Division. It was manned primarily by workers from that city, and when it reached the front it was considered well-trained by the standards of the time.David M. Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad 1941 - 1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, p. 569 Col. Ivan Mikhailovich Antiufeev was appointed to command the division on the day it began forming. Its basic order of battle was as follows: * 1098th Rifle Regiment * 1100th Rifle Regiment * 1102nd Rifle Regiment * 894th Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 77 In late October the division was assigned to 26th Army, which was forming up in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. This army was assigned to the new Volkhov Front in early December, and redesignated as the 2nd Shock Army on the 17th.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 77 Battles for Leningrad On January 7, 1942, 2nd Shock Army entered the Lyuban Offensive Operation. The initial attacks collapsed in exhaustion and confusion, and the army commander was replaced. After regrouping, the attack was resumed on the 13th, this time with more effective artillery preparation, which shattered the defenses between two German infantry divisions and caused one of them to panic. Over the following days the army's forces managed to carve small wedges into the enemy positions, but did not penetrate them until the 17th, with the help of more than 1,500 aircraft sorties, and advanced 5 - 10 km. In order to widen the penetration, the 327th was regrouped into Operational Group Korovnikov in 59th Army for a new attack to begin on January 27. The mission was to eliminate German strongpoints at Spasskaya Polist and Lubino Pole along the Leningrad road. While the attack on the former failed, the bulk of the army, over 100,000 men, was able get past and advance as far as 75 km into the German rear, posing a grave threat to their forces in the Lyuban, Chudovo and Kirishi regions. After the mouth of the penetration was widened on February 12, the 327th, as part of a shock group with 46th Rifle Division, 80th Cavalry Division, and two ski battalions, attacked northward towards Lyuban on the 19th, enveloping and capturing Krasnaya Gorka in the process. Lyuban was only 10 km distant. However, on February 27, elements of German I Corps attacked the flanks of the penetration, recaptured Krasnaya Gorka, and encircled the 327th and 80th Cavalry in Ryabovo. Although most of the encircled forces escaped, the Germans claimed 6,000 prisoners by March 15.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 160-68 On May 21, Colonel Antiufeev was promoted to Major General, but a few days later he left the division; his position was taken by Col. F. M. Zhiltzov. As the ordeal of 2nd Shock Army continued, the remnants of the division, along with 92nd Rifle Division and two rifle brigades, reached and occupied the main defensive line from Ruchi along the Ravan River to Vditsko, Rogavka Station, to Lake Tigoda on May 28, while the army's remaining forces prepared to launch an attack to link up with 59th Army; this attack was set to begin on June 5. This movement was detected by the German forces. On May 30, I Corps and XXXVIII Corps began a joint attack which severed the final link to 2nd Shock late that day, although at considerable cost. A desperate final lunge eastwards by 2nd Shock on June 5 gained little ground. During the following weeks, individual men and small groups of the 327th filtered through the porous German lines, enough that the division could be rebuilt.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 202-03 On July 15 the 87th Cavalry Division, which had also been trapped in the pocket, was officially disbanded, and its remnants were incorporated into the rebuilding 327th.Sharp, \\"Red Sabers\\", Soviet Cavalry Corps, Divisions, and Brigades 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. V, Nafziger, 1995, p. 68 On the same date, Colonel Zhiltzov handed his command over to Lt. Col. Nikolai Antonovich Poliakov, former commander of the 87th Cavalry. This officer was promoted to full colonel on July 25 and would lead the division for the rest of its 1st formation. During the Third Siniavino Offensive, which began on August 19, the division was employed on a secondary sector, south of the main assault front of 2nd Shock Army. It nevertheless distinguished itself in the first week of September by enveloping and capturing the German strongpoint at Voronovo, on the Naziia River, with the help of 286th Rifle Division; both units dug in late on September 7. On January 12, 1943, Volkhov and Leningrad Fronts launched Operation Iskra, which finally opened a land corridor to the besieged city. The 327th distinguished itself again in this fighting, to the east of Siniavino, and on January 19 was redesignated as the 64th Guards Rifle Division, one of a relative handful of formations to win Guards status in the fighting on the northern sector of the Soviet-German Front.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 220, 222, 285 2nd Formation After an absence of over a year from the Red Army order of battle, a new 327th Rifle Division was formed on May 1, 1944, in the 60th Army of 1st Ukrainian Front, based on the soldiers and equipment of the 156th Fortified Region.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, p. 123 Maj.

When the Svir‚ÄìPetrozavodsk Offensive began on June 20, the 327th was transferred again, this time to 23rd Army in Leningrad Front; it would remain in this Front for the duration. At the same time it was assigned to 6th Rifle Corps, where it would remain, apart from a brief period at the end of the year, into the postwar. In January 1945, 6th Corps was shifted to 8th Army, clearing the Baltic coast and islands of remaining German troops, and from March to the war's end the division served as part of the Courland Army Group, containing the isolated forces of the former Army Group North.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", pp. 123-24 General Kozik left his command to Col.

Its editors viewed strong executive leadership as a threat to the liberties of its subscription readership. The paper published staunch and increasingly vitriolic opposition to the leadership and policies of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Historians often consult the pages of the Examiner for insights into the growing problems faced by the Davis administration and the South as they faced the increasing prospect of defeat in the Civil War. History The Examiner was first published as the Richmond Weekly Examiner. The newspaper published a weekly edition from 1848 until about 1863. As Richmond grew, demand for the paper increased and the Examiner began to publish a semi-weekly edition, the Richmond Semi-Weekly Examiner, in 1849. The Examiner began to publish a daily edition in 1861. At the time of Virginia's secession in April, Richmond editors had commenced the publication of four separate, independent daily newspapers. All of the papers supported the Confederate cause, especially as the would-be nation had selected Richmond as its new federal capital. However, the Examiner's executive editor, John Moncure Daniel, personally disliked President Jefferson Davis, and Daniel was not characterized by verbal self-restraint. In the words of the Encyclopedia Virginia, \\"Daniel was known for his mordant, combative personality and rapier- like pen.\\" As Davis promoted some of his Cabinet members and demoted others, and made similar reshuffles and changes to the Confederacy's team of military field commanders, Editor Daniel and his staff defended many of the men who had been held back by the Davis Administration. In sharp contrast to this supportive attitude towards those who had been lateraled or dismissed, the Examiner criticized men who had remained on Davis's team. These critiques took on greater and greater bitterness over time. In August 1864 the daily paper attacked the Treasurer of the Confederate States of America, Edward C. Elmore. The Southern treasury was virtually empty, and the Examiner insinuated that Treasurer Elmore had embezzled the Southern States' tiny remaining stock of hard money in order to enjoy a gambling spree. The enraged treasurer challenged Daniel to a duel, and wounded the crusading editor with a pistol shot.Washington, D.C. \\"Daily National Republican\\", August 16, 1864, p. 1, col 7; Washington, D.C. \\"Evening Star\\", August 27, 1864, p. 4, col. 1 On the military side, the Examiner championed the tactical skills of General Joseph E. Johnston, an officer disliked by President Davis. After Davis relieved Johnston from command over the Army of Tennessee in July 1864, the Examiner began to speak with despondency of the future prospects facing the Confederate States of America. Its editorial position may have caused further problems of morale in a capital city that would soon be hungry and besieged by the Union armies. The daily paper was itself hit by the siege of Richmond, and was unable to continue to publish as a broadsheet with a masthead. The paper struggled on in a half-sheet format without a masthead until the fall of Richmond and the Confederacy in April 1865. The Daily Richmond Examiner tried to continue to publish under Federal occupation, but was unable to do so. The newspaper ceased publication in July 1867, when it merged into the Richmond Enquirer. The Richmond Enquirer & Examiner was published from July 15, 1867 to December 31, 1869, when the newspaper changed its name back to simply Richmond Enquirer. The Library of Virginia has microfilm copies of the Examiner's weekly, semi-weekly, and daily editions for all of the years noted above, and has paper copies of the Semi-Weekly Examiner for the period of 1849-1863.

The three main causes of frizz are genetics, hair damage, and humidity. Frizzy hair can be seen as a positive or a negative trait depending on the current fashion and one's personal preference. Many hair products, such as gels, pomades, and hair waxes, are designed to reduce frizz. Definition There is more than one definition of frizz. Researchers who studied the perception of hair health found that while women around the world perceived the absence of frizz as a sign of healthy hair, how they described \\"frizz\\" varied widely according to hair type and desired style. As described by women in the study, the two main types of frizz are: #short strands sticking up at the part and throughout the hair length that \\"project away from the main body of hair\\"; this type is especially noticeable on women with straight hair who are trying to achieve a smooth style; and #strands of wavy or curly hair that do not align with others to form a defined wave or curl.Marsh (2015), p. 40. By this definition, frizz is not exclusively a characteristic of curly hair; straight hair can be frizzy, and tightly curled or afro-textured hair can be frizz-free. \\"Frizz\\" sometimes refers to curly hair in general, but that is not what most women understand the term to mean. Causes According to cosmetic chemist Randy Schueller, the three main causes of frizz are genetics, damage, and humidity. Genetics Some wavy or curly hair naturally aligns or \\"clumps\\" in a clearly defined, consistent pattern, and some does not. Curly hair that does not have natural curl definition appears frizzy and is sometimes mistakenly characterized as damaged. Even when hair has a defined curl pattern, combing or brushing it when it is dry can break up the clumps, causing the hair to expand into a frizzy mass. This is often done intentionally to add volume.LaFlesh (2010), pp. 68-69. Blow-drying hair from the ends toward the roots can raise the hair's cuticle, resulting in frizz.Milady (2011), p. 466. Damage Although all hair is technically \\"dead\\", hair that has been damaged is perceived as less \\"healthy\\" than undamaged hair.Marsh (2015), p. v. Some styling techniques can cause breakage, chipping of the hair cuticle, and other forms of damage which contribute to frizz. Excessive or rough brushing can cause breakage. This results in frizz because the hair is stretched out of shape before it breaks, so that the shorter hair that remains tends to spring outward, away from the main body of hair. Backcombing can be damaging,Milady (2011), p. 542. as can combing curly hair when it is dry. Excessive use of heat styling tools such as blow dryers and flatirons can weaken the hair, making it susceptible to breakage and split ends.Marsh (2015), p. 64. Recommendations for minimizing heat damage include using heat styling tools set on low,Milady (2011), pp. 64, 548. using a diffuser when blow drying, and never using a curling iron or flat iron on wet hair. Direct heat can boil the water in the hair, causing bubbles to form inside the hair fiber, weakening the hair.Blume-Peytavi (2008), p. 290. Some authors recommend avoiding heat altogether, and allowing the hair to air-dry.LaFlesh (2010), p. 113. Other common causes of hair damage include the use of relaxers and other harsh chemicals; use of a razor to cut curly hair, which weakens the hair cuticle and promotes frizz;Milady (2011), p. 372. and harsh shampoos that strip the hair of its natural oils.Blume-Peytavi (2008), p. 512. Having some hairs that are shorter than others is not necessarily a sign of breakage. Hair naturally sheds as it reaches the end of its growth cycle, and a new hair grows in its place; the average lifespan is about six years.LaFlesh (2010), pp. 26-27. Humidity In a humid environment, moisture penetrates the hair shaft and is absorbed into the cortex, causing the proteins there to swell. Different kinds of proteins absorb moisture and swell differently, causing the hair shaft to twist and bend in an irregular pattern. To prevent this, Schueller recommends using conditioners and styling products that contain dimethicone, which repels humidity. Although moisture causes frizz, which many women perceive as \\"unhealthy\\", many women also believe that moisture is good for their hair, and buy moisturizing hair products. In reality, these products are designed to smooth the surface of the hair rather than increase the hair's water content.Marsh (2015), p. 42. Perception and treatment Young woman with frizzy hair. Frizzy hair has been perceived differently in different eras and cultures. Publicity photos of the silent film star Mary Pickford were often backlit, highlighting her halo of frizz, and the frizzy perm was a mainstay of 1980s Western fashion. In the 1979 film My Brilliant Career, when the frizzy-haired Sybylla threatens to cut off all her hair, her aunt Gussie replies, \\"It'd be a pity to lose your finest asset.\\" Today, some people embrace their natural frizz, while others see it as a problem in need of a solution, and advertisements for hair products often present it as such. Those looking for ways to reduce frizz encounter a great deal of conflicting information online and in the media. Products and treatments that work well for one person may not work for another due to factors such as curl pattern, hair density, hair porosity, the amount of sebum produced, whether the individual strands are coarse or fine, protein levels (which are affected by one's diet), allergies to certain ingredients, regional humidity levels, and finally, subjective ideals of beauty. Moreover, some of the methods used to smooth frizz can cause damage, making hair even more frizz-prone than before; for example, flatirons can burn the hair (see Damage, above), and some hair gels contain drying ingredients.LaFlesh (2010), p. 144. Some experts recommend the use of products containing silicones,LaFlesh (2010), p. 179. while others warn that silicones can cause buildup. Myriad products such as serums, pomades, and hair waxes are designed to reduce frizz, and each has its advocates and detractors. Some relatively non-controversial recommendations for reducing frizz include regular use of instant, deep, and leave-in conditioners;LaFlesh (2010), pp. 183-188. occasional hot oil treatments;LaFlesh (2010), pp. 123-124. and regular trims to remove any split ends or damaged tips.Marsh (2015), p. 38.

L. Edge (1954) \\"Geometry of three dimensions over GF(3)\\", Proceedings of the Royal Society A 222: 262‚Äì86 Robert J. T. Bell described how the regulus is generated by a moving straight line. First, the hyperboloid \\\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\\\frac{y^2}{b^2} - \\\\frac{z^2}{c^2} \\\\ = \\\\ 1 is factored as :\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{a} + \\\\frac{z}{c}\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{a} - \\\\frac{z}{c}\\\\right) \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{y}{b}\\\\right) \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{y}{b}\\\\right) . Then two systems of lines, parametrized by Œª and Œº satisfy this equation: :\\\\frac{x}{a} + \\\\frac{z}{c} \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\lambda \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{y}{b}\\\\right), \\\\quad \\\\frac{x}{a} - \\\\frac{z}{c} \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{y}{b}\\\\right) and :\\\\frac{x}{a} - \\\\frac{z}{c} \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\mu \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{y}{b}\\\\right), \\\\quad \\\\frac{x}{a} + \\\\frac{z}{c} \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{y}{b}\\\\right) . No member of the first set of lines is a member of the second. As Œª or Œº varies, the hyperboloid is generated. The two sets represent a regulus and its opposite. Using analytic geometry, Bell proves that no two generators in a set intersect, and that any two generators in opposite reguli do intersect and form the plane tangent to the hyperboloid at that point.

Following the bishop exchange, the rook is moved to the Fourth File. This contrasts with the defensive so-called normal or standard Fourth File Rook that keeps the bishop diagonal closed until the player is ready for a counterattack so that they may avoid rough and tumble battles initiated by their opponent. (See: Types of Ranging Rook.) Although it's labelled a Fourth File Rook opening, thanks to the bishop exchange the rook can easily switch to the 8th file (for Black) or to the 2nd file (for White), and hence it also keeps some strong elements of Opposing Rook openings.  Overview  In a typical static rook vs. ranging rook game, ranging rook defends from static rook's rook pawn by way of the power of the bishop. In this situation then, with a bishop exchange the rook's pawn can break through and in consequence ranging rook will be at a disadvantage (hence the proverb, \\"Aim for a bishop exchange against ranging rook\\"). For this reason ranging rook will attempt to block the bishop's diagonal early, and will enter battle as soon as the king is castled. In Bishop Exchange Fourth File Rook, instead, the bishop's diagonal remains open and the development of the opening occurs following the bishop exchange. When White (gote) is the one playing ranging rook, the rook moves to 42 without closing the bishop's diagonal. After that, of course, the bishops will be exchanged, and it's possible that the rook will move to the second file, aiming to counterattack against Black's rook pawn. According to professional player Hirokazu Ueno, this opening has three characteristics. First, thanks to the bishop exchange Black doesn't need to worry for an attack on the bishop's head. Second, the tendency to go for a slow game is strong. Finally, it can be used when playing Black or White. In addition, since ranging rook's natural enemy at large is Static Rook's Bear- in-the-hole castle, with the bishop exchange the horse has to be taken by the silver, which means that static rook won't be able to build Bear-in-the-hole without losing one tempo. Furthermore, even if Bear-in-the-hole is built up, since it makes the silver and golds to lean heavily on one side it becomes really easy for ranging rook to find good places to drop the bishop in hand, and even against the solidness of a Mino castle it becomes easy to wage battle, hence the ranging rook is at advantage. Moreover, since White's R-42 places the rook temporarily in the fourth file, it becomes a preparation for a powerful counterattack against Black's B*6e. However, this results of course in the waste of one move, and this isn't necessarily satisfactory. Nevertheless, research has shown that there is no problem even if the Black's bishop is dropped at B*6e, thanks to a development by which rook can then move to the 2nd file and hence turn into a Direct Opposing Rook, which became really popular between 2011 and 2013. An opening to build Bear-in-the-hole from Bishop Exchange Fourth File Rook has also been created, the so called Leghorn Special (ÁôΩËâ≤„É¨„Ç∞„Éõ„É≥„Éª„Çπ„Éö„Ç∑„É£„É´ hakushoku reguhon supesharu or, most commonly, the abbreviation „É¨„Ç∞„Çπ„Éö regusupe).  Craze and K≈çz≈ç Masuda Award  Chikako Nagasawa had been playing Bishop Exchange Fourth File Rook in female tournaments since 2000, and Nagasawa's fellow countryman K≈çichi Kinoshita played it frequently in male tournaments since around 2002. Later on, it started attracting attention when Yoshiyuki Ueyama won against Hiroyuki Miura by using this opening. In addition, according to Ueno, Takeshi Fujii had been exploring novel countermeasures against Anaguma to replace the Fujii System when this opening made its appearance in the world of professional shogi after being popular among college players, and his adoption of the opening caught a lot of attention and produced a craze for the strategy in the subsequent years. Fujii went on to receive the K≈çz≈ç Masuda Award for his use of this strategy in 2013. Development 1\\\\. P-76 P-34. The most common first two moves in shogi: bishop diagonals are opened. 2\\\\.

Role in university restructuring  Prior to his appointment in Adelaide, concerns were raised by the National Tertiary Education Union that Stirling could repeat restructuring plans implemented at Curtin with adverse impacts to staff and students. Plans to restructure Flinders University emerged in 2016, during Stirling's second year in the position. In 2017 the University's previous model of four Faculties and 14 Schools was transformed into six Colleges: College of Business Government and Law; College of Education, Psychology and Social Work; College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences; College of Medicine and Public Health; College of Nursing and Health Sciences and College of Science and Engineering. Professional services were restructured to align with the new model. In 2018 Flinders University embarked upon an academic restructure process which sought to increase staff levels and appoint Teaching Specialists, a move opposed by the local branch of the NTEU.https://indaily.com.au/news/2018/12/07/heartless-cruel-disrespectful- unnecessary-uni-staff-slam-restructure-plan-in-tense-confrontation/ It claimed approximately 200 academic staff members could be affected and that the process could cost Flinders University over A$20 million, in addition to the recruitment costs for new staff members. Stirling believed that the restructure would produce improvements in the university's underlying performance, including growth in commencements and research funding.https://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/flinders- vicechancellor-happy-to-go-his-own-way/news- story/e654d7ec6135328fc98edbd939163b6d The NTEU lodged several notices of dispute which the University referred to the Fair Work Commission.

La Vereda del Monte was the upper part of La Vereda Caballo, (Spanish for \\"The Horse Trail\\"), used by meste√±eros from the early 1840s to drive Alta California horses to Sonora for sale.Frank F. Latta, JOAQUIN MURRIETA AND HIS HORSE GANGS, Bear State Books, Santa Cruz, California. 1980. From its northern beginning at Point of Timber on the Sacramento River Delta near modern-day Brentwood, the trail traveled south to the Livermore Valley. It passed nearby east of Alisal (now part of Pleasanton, California) up into the mountains on Crane Ridge, then continued south through the San Antonio Valley onto the rugged backcountry divide of the Diablo Range, traversing what is now Henry Coe State Park and crossing Pacheco Pass. It continued southward to a mountain ranch on Cantua Creek where mustangs and stolen horses were gathered by Joaquin Murrieta's horse gang before they drove them down the rest of La Vereda Caballo to Sonora for sale. At Poso de Chane east of present-day Coalinga, La Vereda del Monte linked to other roads and trails of La Vereda Caballo such as El Camino Viejo, or another across the valley to the east to the Kern River and Kern Lake, then through Old Tejon Pass, south through Southern California across Antelope Valley and east along the foot of north side of the San Gabriel Mountains before crossing to a spot near Rancho Cucamonga. From there the drove went by various routes, depending on available water, to cross the Colorado Desert into Baja California and the crossings of the Colorado River into what was then Sonora (before the Gadsden Purchase), then across the Sonoran Desert on the Camino del Diablo to Caborca and south into Sonora where the horses were sold. La Vereda del Monte was used by meste√±eros and horse thieves most notably by Joaquin Murrieta's Five Joaquins Gang as a route for driving mustangs and stolen horses from Contra Costa County and the upper Central Valley southward toward Mexico, unobserved by authorities. Murrieta was reportedly killed by California Rangers at the Arroyo de Cantua, after they had found and followed the Vereda to his gathering place there on the trail where he and his gang held and organized their horse herd for the drive to Sonora.  Stations Along The Route Of La Vereda del Monte  * Estaci√≥n primero, Located in Contra Costa County northwest of Point of Timber on Arroyo del Sur, was the uppermost of the gathering points of mustangs for the drove down the Vereda del Monte to Cantua Creek. * Estaci√≥n segundo: Las Tinajas, , a watering place and corral with a supply of relief saddle horses, and occasional captured mustangs to add to the drove. The location is at large outcrops of Vaqueros Sandstone, called Murrieta Rocks, about a mile northeast of Brushy Peak just within the southern bounds of the Rancho Ca√±ada de los Vaqueros. From the east the outcrop overlooks a spring in an eastern tributary arroyo to the upper Kellogg Creek that flows down from Brushy Peak. The original name Las Tinajas, (The Jars), refers to the waterholes to be found eroded into the sandstone on top of the outcrops. * Estaci√≥n tercero: Located along Crane Ridge, at a waterhole in the Arroyo Mocho, in the vicinity of Mud Springs. Fresh saddle horses were stationed here. Between droves the band gathered in horses from the plain beyond Corral Hollow at La Centinela for the next drove. The arroyo was named Mocho after the nickname of the custodian of this and the next station near the source of the arroyo. * Estaci√≥n cuarto: Valle de Mocho, 1st overnight stop in what is now known as Blackbird Valley, south of Mount Mocho. Horses captured on the plain to the east opposite Lone Tree, Hospital, Kern and Ingram Canyons were brought here for the drove as well as horses from the lower Santa Clara Valley as far up the east bay side as the Rancho San Antonio (Peralta) and Rancho San Leandro. The Valle de Mocho was named after the man in charge of the station, Avalino Mart√≠nez, known by his nickname as \\"Mocho,\\" (meaning cut off or short) for his diminutive four feet, four inch, stature. The Arroyo Mocho, and the nearby peak, Mount Mocho is also named after him. * Estaci√≥n quinto: In Adobe Valley was a brush corral that held captured horses taken near Arroyos del Puerto, Salado Grande and Saladillo and brought up Salado Grande and from near Latta Creek, over the mountains toward Adobe Mountain to Adobe Valley. They were added into the drove in San Antonio Valley along with others held in Isabel Valley. From here the Vereda followed the divide of the Diablo Range, taking the path now taken by County Line Road as far as the Fifield Ranch. * Estaci√≥n sexto (alternate): Valle Atravesado, (Crossed Valley),, so named because it lay across the path of the north-south trending Vereda in an east west direction, was an alternative to Valle Hondo as an overnight camp with a brush corral for the drove if it was slowed while driven from Valle de Mocho to Valle Hondo. Valle Atravesado has been subsequently dammed in the 20th century on its south side and is now a reservoir on the upper reach of Mississippi Creek and is now called Mississippi Lake.Henry Coe State Park ‚Äì Backpacking into the Orestimba Wilderness by Richard Perkins from richard-rowland-perkins.com accessed 12/06/2108. See mention in the hiking journal of the author of Mississippi Lake and Dam in Day 2 and Day 4 where he visited it. See also the included topographic map for Day 4 travel. * Estaci√≥n sexto: Valle Hondo (Deep Valley) a former rancheria below the Vereda on North Fork Pacheco Creek, was an overnight camp with a brush corral. Valle Atravesado was the alternative overnight spot if Valle Hondo could not be reached. From either location the drove then added in horses taken from Arroyos Orestimba, Garzas and Meste√±o that had been held at either Estaci√≥n Paraiso or at Mustang Flat. They were added into the drove where the Vereda passed north of Mustang Peak. * Estaci√≥n s√©ptimo: Estaci√≥n Romero, gathered in horses captured opposite Arroyos Quinto, Romero, San Luis Gonzaga and Alamos. This station was a major hangout for the gang, and it had a brush and pole corral for the holding of stolen horses nearby in Bull Heads Canyon that were added into the drove at early daylight. * Pacheco Pass was where La Vereda crossed over the trail through this pass at the head of Pacheco Creek, to the west of its summit. This trail over the Diablo Range, between the coastal valleys and the San Joaquin Valley, was steep and rugged and not heavily traveled until 1857 when a wagon road with a lesser grade than the old trail was built over it. * Frenchs Flat a holding corral for horses to be picked up by the droves, here where the Vereda passed, five miles south of Pacheco Pass. * Estaci√≥n octavo: Aguaje Caballo Blanco. * Estaci√≥n noveno: Valle Quien Sabe, on the Rancho Santa Ana y Quien Sabe.Hoover, Mildred B., et al. Historic Spots in California. 3rd edition. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1966. It was a watering place and sometime gathering point for large numbers of horses from the valleys to the west. * Estaci√≥n d√©cimo: Aguaje Panochita gathered in horses captured opposite Arroyos Los Banos, Ortigalita, Panochita and Panoche Grande. * Estaci√≥n und√©cimo: Corral Redondo located a little ways above the mouth of Arroyo de Corral on the Arroyo Panoche Grande at the eastern foot of the trail over Panoche Pass to the west. Corral Redondo was (and still is) a natural, high banked, almost round loop in the arroyo channel that the vaqueros finished enclosing with drag lines, poles and brush. At this station horses were added in that had been taken from the Upper San Benito, Bitterwater and Salinas Valleys. Also a change of horses was kept there at all times. * Deposito: Rancho de Cantua, on Arroyo Grande (Arroyo de Cantua). The rancho of the Cantua brothers, used to gather and brand and organize the gang's droves of horses. Location of an adobe building, used as a warehouse for the gang. ** Murrieta Spring a historic spring flowing from the south bank of Cantua Creek, about 100 yards above where El Camino Viejo crossed the Creek in the San Joaquin Valley. The Spring formed a pool in the arroyo where it emerged from the foot of the western mountains southwest of the Rancho de Cantua. This is where Harry Love and his detachment of California Rangers found the gang at the spring and attacked them on July 25, 1853. * Joaquin Ridge ** Joaquin Rocks Also known by the name \\"Tres Piedras\\" meaning \\"three rocks\\". It was a lookout, a meeting place and campsite for the gang and its leaders, and also sometimes the route of droves of horses being sent to Sonora. ** Joaquin Spring This spring below Joaquin Rocks to the west along Joaquin Ridge was originally known as Valenzuela Spring until about 1950. This original name probably commemorates Joaquin Valenzuela, one of the Joaquins of the Five Joaquins Gang, leader in charge of the Gang's horse trade to Sonora, and one of the men said to have been killed in the battle of the Cantua at Murrieta Spring. The spring, located in a mountainside meadow, would also supply water and grazing for droves of horses. References * Frank F.

It aired on Fox in the United States on November 6, 2016, and is written by Artie Johann and directed by Brian Iles. The episode title is a play on the lyrics of the Taylor Swift song \\"Shake It Off\\". The episode sees Chris getting a date with Swift. Plot In Brian's Prius, Peter takes Chris and Meg to school. In the school's hallway, Neil tells Chris he's taking Vice- Principal Brenda Maguire to the upcoming school dance, explaining that she's now single since her husband died from ALS. Chris asks Kara Morris to the dance - only for her to shoot him down and call him that robot from Big Hero 6. As Kara leaves, Chris states that the robot's name is Baymax. After Chris is rejected by every girl that he has asked to the dance, Stewie tells him about singer Taylor Swift, who Chris is completely ignorant about. As the conversation snowballs, Stewie suggests that he ask Taylor to the dance. Stewie makes an internet video as a means to ask her out, but Chris reveals that he made his own video and asked her simply out of the blue. She posts a reply video that says she accepts, elating Chris and Stewie. Chris's date with Taylor makes its way to the local news and the Griffin family is excited at meeting Taylor when she arrives at their house to meet Chris before they head off to the dance. Meanwhile, as Peter is goofing off in Brian's car, a businessman enters and sits down in the back seat. Assuming Peter is his Uber driver, since the car is a Prius, he hands him 20 dollars for his fare. Seeing an opportunity, Peter impersonates an Uber driver. After this encounter, he decides that he wants to be a real Uber driver and heads over to their office to apply. While filling out an application, he finds out just what little is required for the job. Hired on the spot, he turns out to be a horrible Uber driver. Peter sees an opportunity to take care of a \\"few\\" errands and \\"quick\\" stops while taking one of his fares to the airport. After Taylor arrives, the Griffins make a good first impression (save for Brian and Meg, who are presumptuous at her movie casting choices). Taylor enjoys her time with Chris at the school dance, and during a walk in the park, the couple kiss. The next day, Brian finds a music video called \\"The Boy in the Giant Tux\\" on Bonnie Swanson's Facebook page that features Taylor mocking, insulting, and making fun of Chris. The video portrays Taylor as a heartbroken girl lashing out at Chris for the way he behaved during their dance date. Brian and Stewie resolve to talk to Taylor in her Rhode Island mansion. When Brian, Chris, and Stewie arrive, she reveals that she sabotages all her relationships \\"with nice guys...and John Mayer\\" so that she can get a lot of material for her songs. Taylor invites Chris to her concert to make it up to him. During one of his drives, Peter's fare directs him to turn down a dark alley, where a group of Italian-accented taxicab drivers are there waiting for him. The fare explains why he led him here, and they begin mercilessly beating him. Turns out that the beating is just because he is an Uber driver, and they don't tolerate competition. Peter manages to shield himself with a Judd Hirsch medallion. As he's going into details about the fabricated story of how he obtained it, his fare burns Brian's Prius. At her next concert, Taylor plays a song called \\"Me, Taylor\\" about falling in love with Chris but is booed because she's too happy. Realizing Taylor lacks inspiration for her art, Chris breaks up with her and insults her to make her angry again so she can gain back her fans. A now elated Taylor smiles then goes back onstage to loud applause when she promises to deliver one of her trademark breakup songs. As Chris, Brian, and Stewie leave the concert, their Uber driver arrives. It's Peter, beaten badly as he rolls up in Brian's now burnt and smoking Prius. At the Griffin house, Lois mentions that Uber is a great job to have despite the fact that Peter got assaulted.

Greenwood was a promising under-16 footballer, but opted to attempt a career in basketball in 2008, moving to the United States in 2011 to play for the University of New Mexico. Greenwood returned to Australia in 2015 and joined the Perth Wildcats of the National Basketball League, but abruptly announced his retirement from basketball to sign with the Adelaide Football Club as a category B rookie in September 2015. After four years with Adelaide, he joined the Suns in October 2019. Early life and career Born and raised in Hobart, Tasmania, Greenwood was a talented junior footballer, representing Tasmania at the national under-16 championships in 2007. The following year, however, he accepted a basketball scholarship at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) and moved to Canberra. He spent four years at the AIS and represented their SEABL team between 2008 and 2010. Following the team's withdrawal from the SEABL in 2011, Greenwood joined the Hobart Chargers for the 2011 season. After winning Basketball Australia's Junior Male Player of the Year in 2008, Greenwood joined the Australian Boomers for their 2009 program. At 17 years and 4 months, he was the youngest athlete on the squad. He later made his debut for the Australian Emus under-19 basketball team at the 2009 FIBA Under-19 World Cup, in New Zealand. Two years later, he helped the Emus to a sixth-place finish at the 2011 FIBA Under-19 World Cup, in Latvia. He averaged 17.1 points, 4.0 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game, and was one of five players named to the All-Tournament Team. He helped Australia win its group with a 5‚Äì1 record, and finished 6-3 in the tournament overall. He also scored a tournament-best 26 points against the United States. College career In April 2011, Greenwood signed a National Letter of Intent to play college basketball for the University of New Mexico. He joined the Lobos program for the 2011‚Äì12 season. Freshman year As a freshman in 2011‚Äì12, Greenwood earned Academic All-Mountain West Conference selection. The Lobos won the Mountain West Tournament title and reached the third round of the 2012 NCAA Tournament. Greenwood scored a season-high 22 points in 19 minutes against Air Force on 8 March 2012, which marked his first 20+ point performance of his career. In 33 games, he averaged 6.3 points, 3.7 rebounds and 2.5 assists in 23.2 minutes per game. Sophomore year As a sophomore in 2012‚Äì13, Greenwood earned Honorable Mention All-Mountain West and repeated as an Academic All-Mountain West selection. He was also named to Bob Cousy Collegiate Point Guard of the Year Award Watch List. He started every game for the Lobos as a sophomore, and led the team in steals with 47. He had a season- best game in win against Boise State on 16 January 2013, recording 15 points and a team-high seven rebounds, all while battling the flu. He also hit a layup to send the game into overtime, where he scored five points in the extra period to clinch the win. The Lobos once again won the Mountain West regular- season and tournament titles, and reached the second round of the 2013 NCAA Tournament. In 35 games, he averaged 7.0 points, 5.0 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 1.3 steals in 28.5 minutes per game. Junior year As a junior in 2013‚Äì14, Greenwood earned All-Conference Honorable Mention for a second consecutive season and Academic All-Mountain West for a third consecutive season. He finished sixth in assist-to-turnover ratio in the NCAA with 105 assists and 30 turnovers (3.5 asst-to). He also recorded 105 assists after tallying 83 as a freshman and as a sophomore. On 21 January 2014, he scored a season-high 20 points against Boise State for his second 20+ point game of his career. The Lobos won the Mountain West Tournament title for a third straight year and once again reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament. In 31 games, he averaged 6.2 points, 5.1 rebounds and 3.4 assists in 31.8 minutes per game. Senior year As a senior in 2014‚Äì15, Greenwood earned Academic All- Mountain West (fourth straight year), NABC All-District Second Team, and All- Mountain West Third Team honours. During the season, he became the 33rd Lobo to reach the 1,000-point career mark. He also became the 17th Lobo in program history to reach 1,000 points and 500 rebounds, and joined Lamont Long as the only guards in program history with 1,000 points and 600 rebounds. Greenwood graduated top ten in Lobo history in career minutes played (3,843), assists (372) and made three-point field goals (187). On 20 November 2014, he scored a career-high 24 points against Boston College in the ESPN Puerto Rico Tip-Off. On 21 January 2015, he scored 22 points on six made three-pointers and had eight rebounds against UNLV. During the game, he had his first dunk since his freshman year. He scored in double figures in 18 games, with five of those games being 20-point performances. After dominating the Mountain West Conference for three seasons, Greenwood and the Lobos were knocked out in the first round of the 2015 Mountain West Tournament. In 31 games, he averaged 11.6 points, 5.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.5 steals in 35.3 minutes per game. Professional basketball career After earning a pre-draft workout invite from the Utah Jazz in May 2015, Greenwood signed a three-year contract with the Perth Wildcats of the Australian National Basketball League on 1 June 2015. The following month, Greenwood joined an Australian squad for the 2015 World University Games in Gwangju, South Korea. With preseason training beginning on 3 August 2015, Greenwood impressed in his first week as a Wildcat, coming away with great results in a series of performance tests. However, on 20 August 2015, Greenwood walked out on the Wildcats to have a crack at breaking into the AFL ranks. AFL career While at New Mexico, Greenwood was approached by several AFL teams, but he knocked them back to continue with basketball. By mid-August 2015, however, Greenwood had lost the motivation to play basketball and subsequently retired from the game to pursue AFL. After training with the Adelaide Football Club for two weeks, Greenwood signed a two-year category B rookie contract with the club on 4 September 2015. In 2016, Greenwood made a smooth transition into the Crows' State League side after an eight-year hiatus from competitive football. He played every game of the season, impressing in roles through the midfield and half-forward. He showed strong physicality and developed his ball skills throughout the year, averaging 16 disposals and kicking 25 goals from 21 games, and helped the club reach the SANFL finals for the first time. As a result, he finished sixth in the State League Club Champion award. Greenwood (right) during the 2017 AFL Grand Final Parade On 10 May 2017, the Crows promoted Greenwood to their senior list as possible cover for the concussed Tom Lynch, naming him as an emergency for their Round 8 clash. A week later, the Crows named Greenwood to make his debut on 20 May 2017 against the Brisbane Lions at the Gabba. In his debut, he kicked three first-half goals and finished with 15 disposals, two marks and nine tackles in helping Adelaide defeat Brisbane 140‚Äì60. Greenwood quickly became an important part of Adelaide's midfield and impressed in his first season at AFL level, having a mature body and kicking with high efficiency. He was a member of the Crows' 2017 Grand Final side. At the conclusion of the 2019 AFL season, Greenwood requested a trade to . The trade was finalised on 15 October 2019. Personal Greenwood is the son of Mike and Andree Greenwood. His father played water polo and his mother played basketball. Greenwood's sister, Josie, also played college basketball at New Mexico. Greenwood's grandfather, Peter Marquis, won three consecutive VFL premierships with Melbourne between 1955 and 1957. In 2015, his mother was diagnosed with terminal secondary breast cancer. He subsequently started a charity to raise funds for the UNM Cancer Center in honour of his mother, which received over $50,000 in donations throughout the course of the senior season. Andree was surrounded by her family in Tasmania when she lost her battle with breast cancer on 23 October 2017.

A Coxeter decomposition of a polygon is a decomposition into a finite number of polygons in which any two sharing a side are reflections of each other along that side. Hyperbolic polygons are the analogues of Euclidean polygons in hyperbolic geometry. A hyperbolic n-gon is an area bounded by n segments, rays, or entire straight lines. The standard model for this geometry is the Poincar√© disk model. A major difference between Euclidean and hyperbolic polygons is that the sum of internal angles of a hyperbolic polygon is not the same as Euclidean polygons. In particular, the sum of the angles of a hyperbolic triangle is less than 180 degrees. A triangle group formed by reflecting a triangle on its sides.Coxeter decompositions are named after Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter, an accomplished 20th century geometer. He introduced the Coxeter group, an abstract group generated by reflections. These groups have many uses, including producing the rotations of Platonic solids and tessellating the plane.  Coxeter decompositions  Given a polygon P, a group G can be generated by reflecting P around its sides. If the angles of P are /k for natural numbers k, then G will be discrete. A Coxeter decomposition of a polygon is a decomposition into a finite number of polygons in which any two sharing a side are reflections of each other along that side. The goal of a Coxeter decomposition is to break up a polygon into a composition of congruent triangles reflected on its sides.  Hyperbolic triangles  If triangle ABC can undergo Coxeter decomposition and has angles k_i\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{q_i}, where k_i is the number of times the ith angle is broken up, the triangle ABC can be written as \\\\left( \\\\frac{k_1}{q_1}, \\\\frac{k_2}{q_2}, \\\\frac{k_3}{q_3}\\\\right). Several properties of these fundamental polygons are known for hyperbolic triangles. The decomposition of a triangle with three fundamental angles * The fundamental triangle has a right angle. The proof of this involves two cases dependent on if the angles of the decomposed triangle are fundamental. If they are not, then it follows that since the process of decomposition is finite, eventually a fundamental triangle will be formed with a right angle. If they are, a proof by contradiction based on the area of the fundamental triangle proves that it will have a right angle. * For a triangle \\\\left( \\\\frac{k_1}{q_1}, \\\\frac{k_2}{q_2}, \\\\frac{k_3}{q_3}\\\\right), at least two q_i are equal. This is also proved by contradiction based on the area of the fundamental polygon found using the Gauss‚ÄìBonnet theorem. We can say the area of the whole triangle is equal to the number of fundamental triangles times their area. This gives us 1 -\\\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\\\frac{k_i}{q_i} = N \\\\left( 1 -\\\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\\\frac 1 {q_i}\\\\right). If we assume that q_1>q_2>q_3, then the previous equality is broken for N>1. Therefore, at least two angles are equal. * Given a triangle where all three angles are fundamental, there is a single decomposition. A nontrivial proof of this can be found in. * All possible decompositions are known.These are all Coxeter decompositions of hyperbolic triangles, excluding the more detailed one above.  Other hyperbolic polygons  Quadrilaterals may also have Coxeter decompositions. * If a quadrilateral in not convex, then there are two possible triangular decompositions. This is done by decomposing it into two triangles are then decomposing those. These two triangles are obtuse. *A quadrilateral can be decomposed by quadrilaterals. * All decompositions of convex quadrilaterals are also known.

Through advocacy initiatives, educational programs, architectural resources, and cultural events, the foundation‚Äôs goal is to encourage the community to learn about and preserve the historic buildings that make the Tucson and Pima County unique. History Founded in 1985, the organization is committed to honoring and preserving Tucson's unique architectural treasures and public spaces. During the early 1980s, a growing concern over the continual demolition of historic buildings sparked the conception of a non-profit organization that could actively protect and advocate for Tucson's historic built environment. In March 1985, the Tucson Historic Preservation Foundation was established for the purpose of acquiring, maintaining, and preserving endangered historic properties in the Tucson area. The Tucson-Pima County Historical Commission was instrumental in helping organize the Foundation. Judge Norman S. Fenton, the first president of the new non-profit, said: \\"The Foundation was created by those who felt frustrated at having to stand helplessly by on many occasions and see historical buildings and part of Tucson's heritage destroyed because there was not an appropriate organization available for their acquisition and preservation.\\" Ironically initial funding for the Foundation came from the sale of salvageable materials donated by Frank McClure and Homes Tuttle Ford from the demolition of the Spanish Revival Mansion \\"Avalon House\\"¬ù on Oracle Road. The Foundation's primary goal was to establish a solid financial base that would enable THPF to act quickly, if necessary, to save endangered historic buildings. Although the foundation never fulfilled it intended mission, it did influence the protection and stabilization of many Tucson Historic Properties. Funds from the Foundation were loaned to Fort Lowell Neighborhood Association to preserve the Historic San Pedro Chapel. In the early 1990s, the Foundation became dormant. In 2008 under the leadership of Demion Clinco the organization was restructured and a new board established. The organization has been able to save Tucson's neon signs, listed numerous building on the National Register of Historic Places and as Local Historic Landmarks. The Tucson Historic Preservation Foundation launched Tucson Modernism Week in 2011 and continues to manage the annual educational program. The foundation has worked to save southern Arizona's early silent film heritage including restoration and screenings of silent films shot in Tucson and southern Arizona including The Mine with the Iron Door and Ridin' Wild (1925 film). As of 2016, Demion Clinco serves as the Executive Director and Suzy Gershman as the President of the Board. In 2016 the Foundation purchased and saved the Hirsh's Shoes building, located at 2934 E Broadway Blvd in Tucson. Awards Each year the Foundation presents awards to recognize the individuals, organizations and projects that work to preserve Tucson's heritage : * The Grand Punch Bowl Award. Each year, the Preservation Foundation Board of Directors honor an individual who has contributed not only to the foundation‚Äôs mission, but has made a significant contribution the work of preservation in the Tucson community. The honoree keep the bowl until a new individual is recognized. The historic punch bowl originally served guests for decades starting in 1947 at the Lodge on the Desert. * The Presidents's Award. Starting in 2012 and continuing yearly, the president of the Tucson Historic Preservation Foundation has recognized a board member for their extraordinary contribution to the organization. Archives The organization's Archives exist to sustain the mission of the foundation by collecting, preserving, organizing, and encouraging use of its historical documents and research materials. Maintained are a collection of books, historic documents, resource materials and photographs dealing with architecture, Tucson, Arizona history, historic preservation, as well as horticulture and landscape architecture.

Biography There is not much known about the early career of Alaminos other than that he was from Cu√©llar, and that he was born on 27 October 1813. His military career began with his participation in the First Carlist War (1833‚Äì1839). He then served under General Juan Prim, 1st Marquis of los Castillejos during the Hispano-Moroccan War (1859‚Äì60). In 1871, he was elected as Senator of Burgos, and the following year (1872) as Senator of C√≥rdoba. Before the abdication of King Amadeo I of Spain, Alaminos was sent to assume the position of Governor-General of the Philippines on 24 January 1873. He was the first Governor-General to arrive and depart from the Philippines on a steamship. During his term, Alaminos fought against the Archbishop of Manila, Gregorio Melit√≥n Martinez, keeping the conflict between the colonial government and the church ongoing. It was during the administration of former Governor-General Carlos Mar√≠a de la Torre y Navacerrada when the conflict was rekindled. In around 1870, the governor- general appointed Luis Alcala Zamora as Bishop of Cebu but it was not approved by Archbishop Melit√≥n Martinez. Alaminos was replaced by an interim governor in 1874, during the administration of President Francisco Serrano, 1st Duke of la Torre. He died in 1899. During his administration in the Philippines, Alaminos, Pangasinan and Alaminos, Laguna were named in his honor. Family Alaminos hails from a 17th-century noble family from √öbeda. Juan's brother, Francisco Alaminos y Vivar, was a lawyer. He served as mayor of Rute in 1828, and of Cabra in 1834. Meanwhile, Juan's nephew, Francisco Alaminos y Chacon, served as his adjutant, and later as Governor of Luzon.

The main line from Swansea to Neyland, a port on Milford Haven, was opened as a broad-gauge line by the South Wales Railway from 1852, and that company merged with the Great Western Railway in 1862. The main line was converted to \\"narrow gauge\\" (later known as \\"standard gauge\\") in 1872, and most of the original main line is in use today. Several independent lines were opened in West Wales, and at the \\"grouping\\" of the railways in 1923 most of them were absorbed by the Great Western Railway. Some of them were chiefly mineral railways, and many have closed as the industries they served declined. Some rural routes too have closed, but branch lines to Pembroke and Milford Haven, and a main line extension to Fishguard are still in operation. Predecessor waggonways and canals Although the economy of south-west Wales was predominantly agricultural, there were areas of mineral extraction. This chiefly consisted of coal in the area north of Llanelly and around Saundersfoot. Limestone was also quarried around Llanelly, and on a smaller scale further west and north. In the eighteenth century transport to market dominated these industries, and only locations close to water were successful. Primitive waggonways were built conveying the mineral over relatively short distances directly to the coast. The first short part of the Carmarthenshire Railway had been opened in 1803, giving a plateway tramroad connection between coal pits and a quay at Llanelly. By 1805 the line had reached Cross Hands, high on Mynydd Mawr (Carmarthenshire), bringing good quality anthracite down from there to the sea. For a time the line flourished, but by 1832 it was in decline, and part of the lower alignment had been used for a new edge railway, while the upper parts had become derelict. Other mineral lines now became dominant in the area, and the Carmarthenshire Railway ceased to play an important role in the traffic. In 1812 the Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal and Tramroad Company was authorised by Parliament, to build a canal serving Llanelly, with feeder waggonways serving pits. Two horse-operated waggonway branches, probably of 4 ft 2in gauge, were built to Burry Port harbour in 1832. One of them ran north to Cwmcapel and the other east to Sandy, near Llanelly. At this point it connected with the Cille Colliery waggonway on the Stradey Estate.M R C Price, Llanelly & Mynydd Mawr Railway, Oakwood Press, Usk, 1992 Michael Denman, Railways Around Llanelli: A History of the Railways of East Carmarthenshire.

This was an edge railway, and traction was limited to horses. Emboldened by the success of the initial line, the company decided to build a more ambitious line from the Llanelly Dock to pits further to the north-east. The company changed its name at this time to the Llanelly Railway and Dock Company, by Act of 21 August 1835. This second line, separate from the Dafen line, opened as far as Pontardulais in 1839, extending to Duffryn and Cwmamman on 6 May 1840. In the following two years an eastward extension to pits in the Amman Valley was opened, and in 1842 a westward branch to the Great Mountain (Mynydd Mawr) was constructed. The company operated trains itself, now using steam locomotives, and from 1850 a passenger service was run.Michael Denman, The Llanelly Railway and Dock Company: The Heart of Wales Pioneer. The Wider View, Ilminster, 2012, South Wales Railway=Origins The South Wales Railway in 1856 The Great Western Railway completed its first main line between London and Bristol in 1841, and already during the construction period thought had been given to branches and extensions. The Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway had opened part of its line, from Swindon to Cirencester, and was continuing construction to Gloucester and Cheltenham. In 1843 the Cheltenham company was absorbed by the Great Western Railway, and now planning turned to the means of reaching South Wales. In 1844 the South Wales Railway was proposed, to run from Standish, south of Gloucester on the Cheltenham line, through Chepstow, Newport, Cardiff, and Neath, passing close to Swansea and Carmarthen, to Fishguard. There was to be a branch from Whitland to Pembroke. The Great Western Railway and its associated companies used the broad gauge, unlike most other lines in Great Britain, which used the narrow gauge, later called standard gauge. Although the South Wales Railway was to be an independent company, it was supported by the GWR and had many mutual directors and investors, and its engineer was Isambard Kingdom Brunel. In fact when it was authorised by the Act of 1845 the GWR was to subscribe ¬£600,000 of the ¬£2.8 million capital of the company. There was to be a swing bridge over the River Loughor (between Gowerton and Llanelly) and a drawbridge over the River Towy near Carmarthen.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: Volume I: 1833 to 1963: Part II. Great Western Railway, London, 1927 There were difficulties about the selection of route east of Newport, and a further Act of 1846 followed; this also authorised a branch from Landore to Swansea, and a Haverfordwest branch from near the later Clarbeston Road. A perpetual lease of the line to the Great Western Railway was agreed at this time, on the basis of a rent of 5% on the capital of ¬£4 million (shares and loans combined) and half of any surplus profit. This arrangement was to commence on the line reaching Fishguard, and meantime the GWR would work the line on behalf of the SWR.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: Volume I: 1833 to 1963: Part I. Great Western Railway, London, 1927 Gauge of the South Wales Railway In 1846 the Gauge Commission, established by Parliament, reported. The commission had been charged to consider the future track gauge of railways in Great Britain. The existence of the broad gauge throughout the Great Western Railway system and its allies, and the narrow gauge (as it was then called) on most other lines, resulted in inconvenience at the break-of-gauge: locations where the two systems met. While this was an inconvenience for passenger traffic, it was a serious problem for goods and mineral traffic, which had to be manually transshipped. The commissioners found that the break of gauge was \\"a serious evil\\" and recommended that no further railway should be constructed on the broad gauge system, and that \\"some equitable means should be found of producing such entire uniformity of gauge or of adopting such other course as would admit of the Narrow Gauge carriages passing, without interruption or danger, along the Broad Gauge Lines.\\"Gauge Commissioners' Report, quoted in MacDermot, volume I part I, page 235 The report appeared to call into question the gauge of the already authorised South Wales Railway, but the Lords of the Board of Trade, having considered the matter, modified the policy. It was their opinion that the SWR should be made on the broad gauge, and the resulting Act stated that the railways authorised > by an Act passed in the last session of Parliament, intituled An Act for > making a railway to be called \\"The South Wales Railway\\" [and a modifying > Act] intituled \\"An Act for completing the Line of the South Wales Railway\\", > and to authorize the Construction of an Extension and certain Alterations of > the said Railway, and certain Branch Railways in Connexion therewith... > shall be constructed on the Gauge of Seven Feet.An Act for Regulating the > Gauge of Railways (18th August 1846) Accordingly, the line was built on the broad gauge, with far-reaching consequences. The Western terminal As well as serving the industry and commerce of south and south-west Wales, the South Wales Railway was intended to link with a ferry between Fishguard and a harbour in Ireland in the Wexford area. By providing a transport medium between southern Ireland and the GWR network, it was hoped to secure the Post Office contract for mail between London and Dublin. This relied on a partner railway in Ireland, the Waterford, Wexford, Wicklow and Dublin Railway Company. Fishguard Bay was considered to be a suitable location for the development of a ferry port, and Brunel contemplated developing a transatlantic shipping business using Fishguard. In 1845 there was a catastrophic failure of the potato crop on which a majority of Irish people depended for a living; this resulted in mass starvation and commercial depression, which deepened the following year. The catastrophe is known as the Great Famine, and also as the Irish Potato Famine. The economy in Ireland worsened considerably, and coincidentally the general economic climate throughout the United KingdomAt this period the United Kingdom consisted of Great Britain and all of Ireland. worsened considerably making the raising of money extremely difficult.Ernie Shepherd, Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company: An Illustrated History, Colourpoint Books, Newtownards, 2015, The Irish railway promoters saw that it was hopeless to try to raise money for their railway, and for the time being indicated that they would be unable to pursue the link on the Irish side. The South Wales directors saw that building a line as far as Fishguard was futile, and approached the GWR proposing that the 5% guarantee should come into effect on the line reaching Swansea, and not Fishguard. The GWR were not amenable to this extension of their liability and declined. The South Wales Railway company naturally had to consider its position, and a certain alienation from the GWR took place at this time, signalised by the resignation of certain shared directors whose positions were now untenable.K A Murray and D B McNeill, Great Southern & Western Railway, Irish Railway Record Society, Dublin, 1976, First opening of the South Wales Railway Construction of the first section of the South Wales Railway, between Chepstow and Swansea, had been proceeding and it opened for traffic on 18 June 1850. The crossing of the River Wye at Chepstow was not ready, and this section was therefore isolated from the rest of the railway system for two years, until the river was bridged, on 19 July 1852. The Great Western Railway had been working the Bristol and Exeter Railway by contract, but the B&ER; had taken over its own working; accordingly the GWR had a temporary surplus of rolling stock, and was able to work the SWR line from its opening. The schism between the SWR and the GWR was partly resolved by March 1851, when the SWR determined to build to a terminal on the waterway known as Milford Haven instead of Fishguard. The location became known as Neyland. A lease of 999 years to the GWR, (more properly a working agreement) to take effect when the line was ready to Swansea, was now agreed. Meantime the line would be worked, so far as locomotive and train operation was concerned, by the GWR. Neyland would be reached by extending the Haverfordwest branch, and work on the Fishguard line beyond the intended point of junction was suspended. Opening to Carmarthen 1852 The next section of the SWR, from Landore to Carmarthen, was opened on 11 October 1852.D Bertram, British Railways in West Wales, in the Railway Magazine, November 1962 The Carmarthen station was south of the present-day triangle of lines, close to the Pensarn to Cwmffrwd road (now A484). Barlow rail was used as a cheaper alternative track type; the rail had a broad splayed base and was laid direct in the ballast without sleepers. Engineering features of the route included Cockett Tunnel, of 789 yards and preceded on the Swansea side, by three embankment stabilisation structures, two of which were slender brick large radius arches, the third, a short tunnel, a timber viaduct at Loughor with a wrought iron swing bridge opening section, a timber viaduct at Kidwelly with a wrought iron lifting bridge section. The South Wales Railway route crossed the two lines of the Llanelly Railway and Dock company, and the SWR authorising Act did not specify in detail how this was to be done. It was assumed that the crossing would be on the level, but at this time the Llanelly Company wished to sell its network to the South Wales Railway, and suggested that the crossing would make its system unworkable: it demanded that the SWR pay compensation equivalent to a purchase. The SWR had no interest in acquiring a narrow gauge (later referred to as standard gauge) mineral railway and refused. This issue dragged on for a considerable time, with the Llanelly company putting obstacles in the way, and the SWR considered crossing by a viaduct. Finally the SWR opened its line, crossing the Llanelly lines by flat crossings, and the matter was put to rest. There were also minor horse tramways crossed on the level near Llanelly. In 1852 an Act of Parliament was obtained authorising the extension from Haverfordwest to Neyland and abandonment of the Fishguard line. The lease arrangement with the GWR was again the source of controversy, and the GWR was considered to be exploiting an unfairly high rate of charges while providing inadequate wagons for available goods traffic, and it was only after considerable negotiation that agreement was reached; even then the SWR gave notice to terminate the agreement at the earliest opportunity, on 30 June 1857. Opening west of Carmarthen 1853 On 2 January 1854 the line was opened from Carmarthen to Haverfordwest; it was a single line of Barlow rails. A drawbridge, capable of carrying double track later, was provided at Carmarthen to cross the River Towy. The line onwards from Haverfordwest to Neyland was opened on 15 April 1856; the terminus was known at first as Milford Haven,Parker says \\"New Milford\\" at first but this may be a mistake. after the waterway on which it was located; the name Neyland was adopted in 1859. The extension was a single line; there was an opening bridge with a lifting span over the River Cleddau at Haverfordwest. Although there were a few dwellings there, Neyland had no pre-existing commerce whatever, and was created entirely by the SWM. A twice-weekly ferry to Waterford was started soon after the railway opening. As the berthing facilities were expanded, four pontoons were incorporated into the works from the Cornwall Railway, where they had been used for floating the main spans of the Royal Albert Bridge at Saltash.Richard Parker: Neyland: A Great Western Outpost, KRB Publications, Bishops Waltham, 2002, The distance from Neyland to Waterford was 111 miles; Wexford had been abandoned due to silting of the harbour there.H Fayle, The Jubilee of the Fishguard and Rosslare Route: I, in the Railway Magazine, May 1956 By now the use of Barlow rails on the original section of the line was found to be unsatisfactory, and this latest section was laid with bridge rails on longitudinal timbers; the earlier Barlow rail sections were progressively relaid in this form of construction; the work was a considerable financial burden. The original Act authorising the South Wales Railway had included a Pembroke branch from near Whitland. The western terminus of the line was now to be at Neyland, which was only a short ferry crossing from Pembroke Dock, and the South Wales Railway were reluctant to construct the branch. They delayed starting work, but a local person named Allen brought an action to force them to do so, under the so-called \\"Cardwell clause\\" inserted into the authorising Act; this provided for a suspension of dividends if the authorised lines were not constructed. The South Wales Railway attempted some delaying tactics, but were obliged to go to Parliament to ask for an extension of time, and the dividend for the first half of 1857 was not paid. The SWR also presented a proposal for an alternative Pembroke branch. In fact the House of Lords finally agreed with the SWR that building the Pembroke branch was no longer appropriate, and they were released from the obligation. The branch was later built independently by the Pembroke and Tenby Railway. The line between Carmarthen and Neyland was doubled on 1 July 1857. There was now a double track broad gauge line throughout from Paddington, miles in length, of which 164 miles belonged to the South Wales Railway. The traffic on the line was buoyant, except that coal from South Wales was hampered by the gauge change from the narrow gauge lines in the valleys to the main line, and much of that traffic continued to go by coastal shipping. Cattle traffic from Ireland was especially profitable, but the anticipated transatlantic steamer traffic at Neyland did not materialise. The Llanelly Railway and Dock company had a Llanelly station near its own dock, but the importance of connection to the emerging main line network was obvious, and the LR&D; opened a short branch line to a terminus alongside the SWR Llanelly station. Nevertheless, because of the gauge difference, through running was not possible, and a transhipment shed was constructed for the transfer of goods there; these facilities opened in 1852. Neyland and Milford Haven The South Wales Railway terminus was on the body of water named Milford Haven; MacDermot explains the nomenclature of the railway station: > The new port was called \\"Milford Haven\\" till 1859, then for a few months by > its proper name of Neyland; but by the end of that year the Railway Company > christened it \\"New Milford,\\" which nickname it retained for more than forty > years till after the resurrection of its ancient rival Fishguard, when its > real name was restored in the hour of defeat.MacDermot, volume I part II, > page 579 Neyland was selected for its deep water anchorage, but there was no community there except for a few dwellings, and an independent company was sponsored to build a short branch from Johnston to the town named Milford Haven, which had been established in 1790; by 1800 the first large buildings had been built. The Royal Navy and some shipbuilding concerns left the town after 1814, but by then it was well established.Patricia Swales Barker, Milford Haven Through Time, Amberley Publishing, Stroud, 2013, The Milford Railway was incorporated on 5 June 1856, and it constructed the line. It arranged with the Great Western Railway, lessee of the South Wales Railway, to work the line, and in fact it was opened by the Great Western Railway on 7 September 1863,Parker says that this was when the inhabitants formed their own railway company, but that seems to be a misunderstanding. after amalgamation of the SWR. The Milford Railway was purchased by the GWR in 1896 for ¬£50 10s 0d per cent.MacDermot volume II, page 4Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Carmarthen to Fishguard, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2010, The natural harbour at Milford Haven was satisfactory at first, but it was restricted in size, and in 1860 the Milford Haven Docks and Railway Company was authorised (on 23 July), to build a pier at Noyes Point, nearly two miles east of Milford Haven, and a railway to connect it at Milford Haven. The works evidently proceeded slowly for it opened on 18 January 1882, after several acts authorising extension of time. It was leased to the contractor Samuel Lake and Company; Lake had extensive involvement locally at this time. He sub-let the line to the Milford Haven estate, but it was worked by the GWR. In 1921 it became privately controlled, and Awdry, writing in 1990, said that \\"it still is\\".Awdry, page 224E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume II: 1863 - 1921, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1931 However the pier is now (2016) derelict and the railway connection is long since gone. Amalgamation of the South Wales Railway with the GWR 1862 The construction of the West Midland Railway and the laying of narrow gauge rails into Paddington station, caused the GWR to consider amalgamation with the WMR, and negotiations with the South Wales Railway were opened up as well. These went well and the unsatisfactory hybrid working arrangement was replaced by conventional lease at a rent of ¬£170,000 per annum from 1 January 1862, from which date the SWR was for all practical purposed part of the GWR system. SWR proprietors were guaranteed per cent on their capital. Amalgamation was authorised by Act of 21 July 1863, to come into effect on 1 August 1863. Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway On 7 August 1854 the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway obtained Parliamentary authorisation to build a line to Cardigan from a junction with the South Wales Railway at Carmarthen. It was to be a broad gauge line, and a new Carmarthen station closer to the town than the SWR station, was to be constructed. The company found it difficult to raise money for construction, and at first was only able to open from the SWR as far as its own Carmarthen station: this section was opened on 1 March 1860; the SWR Carmarthen station was renamed Carmarthen Junction. The C&CR; extended a further 6 miles to Conwil on 3 September 1860. The C&CR; was worked by GWR engines, and it was immediately unprofitable, and it closed on 31 December 1860. It reopened on 12 August 1861 and opened an extension to Pencader on 28 March 1864 and to Llandyssul on 3 June 1864. It never got any further during its independent existence, and its own traffic was never busy. Llanelly Railway and the Vale of Towy The Llanelly Railway and Dock company had reached the Amman Valley and had a branch to Cross Hands on Mynydd Mawr. In addition, from May 1850 it was running passenger trains between Duffryn and Pontardulais, with omnibus connections at each end forming a multi-modal through service between Llandilo and Swansea. It continued to aspire towards a northwards extension, connecting with other lines that were extending southwards from the industrial north-west of England. By 1853 the company's financial situation had improved sufficiently for it to obtain Parliamentary authorisation to extend the line from Duffryn to Llandilo. The extension was opened as a narrow (standard) gauge line on 24 January 1857. Meanwhile, another company, the Vale of Towy Railway had obtained its authorising Act on 10 July 1854 for a line from Llandovery to Llandilo. Capital was ¬£55,000 and mixed gauge track was authorised, as sale to the Great Western Railway or its allies was anticipated. The line was opened to passengers on 1 April 1858, but goods trains had already been running for a few weeks. The line was just over 11 miles long; the Vale of Towy company did not run its own trains; it was worked by the Llanelly company. The Central Wales Railway was authorised on 13 August 1859 to build southwards from Craven Arms, near Shrewsbury, to Llandrindod Wells; it opened its line on 10 October 1865. A further link in the chain was the Central Wales Extension Railway, authorised on 3 July 1860 to build from Llandrindod Wells to Llandovery; construction proved difficult and time consuming, but it eventually opened throughout to reach Llandovery on 8 October 1868. This completed a through narrow (standard) gauge route from Llanelly to the north-west of England. The Central Wales Extension Railway and the Central Wales Railway were friendly to the London and North Western Railway, and in fact were absorbed by the LNWR in 1868. The Llanelly Railway had hoped that the South Wales Railway or the Great Western Railway would purchase its line, but that was refused, and the rival LNWR gained a territorial advantage in the process. Manchester and Milford Railway The idea of connecting the industrial north west of England to West Wales had been shared by other groups of promoters, and in 1860 the Manchester and Milford Railway was authorised. Originally it had been intended to build all or most of the way between Manchester and the waterway at Milford Haven. Delay in getting financial support eroded that grand idea, and it was now truncated to connect Llanidloes and Pencader. At Llanidloes it was to connect with the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway, giving access, it was hoped, to a chain of other lines reaching Manchester. At the southern end at Pencader, it would connect with the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway, and somehow gain westward access to Milford Haven. This was to be 51 miles of line through remote and wild country, with limited intermediate business and with no firm commitments at the ends for onward connections. As an afterthought there was to be a branch to Aberystwyth. The line was to be narrow (standard) gauge, and proposed share capital was ¬£555,000. The M&MR; Act compelled the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway to lay a third rail to enable the passage of M&MR; narrow (standard) gauge trains to Carmarthen from Pencader. In fact during construction, it was realised that the original route to Llanidloes was impracticable, and in 1865 the M&MR; obtained authorisation to make the Aberystwyth line the main line, abandoning the Llanidloes route. Still desperately short of money, the M&MR; opened its first section from Pencader to Lampeter on 1 January 1866. The C&CR; had not laid the necessary third rail for through running, and for several months the break of gauge was an obstacle. The M&MR; instructed its own contractor to lay the rail, and M&MR; goods trains ran through to Carmarthen over the C&CR; from 1 November 1866; passenger train operation commenced on 1 November 1867. Meanwhile, the M&MR; had been building northwards, and opened its own line as far as Strata Florida (the railway location was known locally as Ystrad Meurig at first) for goods trains by the end of August 1866. The entire route of 41 miles to Aberystwyth was opened throughout on 12 August 1867. At first the service was operated by the contractors, using three Sharp, Stewart locomotives.J S Holden, The Manchester and Milford Railway, Oakwood Press, Usk, 1979, Llanelly Railway extensions to Swansea and Carmarthen Through the 1850s, Swansea had been growing in importance as an industrial centre, and its docks had been considerably extended and modernised. Meanwhile, Llanelly Dock had stagnated, and shippers increasingly turned away from it. The Swansea Vale extension line to Brynamman gave easy railway access to Swansea. The Llanelly company decided it had to make a connection to Swansea and also to Carmarthen, which would give access to the West Wales harbours. The Company had little chance of raising the money for these lines itself, and in October 1860 the directors negotiated with financiers who, they hoped, would provide the money for the new lines. Almost immediately the financial partners proved to be insubstantial, and the arrangement collapsed. Anxious to revive the scheme, the Llanelly Company now courted the London and North Western Railway, which (through the Central Wales companies) had reached Llandovery and naturally sought access to south and west Wales. On 1 August 1860 the Llanelly Railway (New Lines) Act obtained the Royal Assent, authorising a branch line from Llandilo to join the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway near Carmarthen, and another line from Pontardulais to Swansea through Dunvant. The Act also restructured the Company into the \\"Original Line\\" and the \\"New Lines\\", and change that was to have a serious unforeseen effect. The Carmarthen line opened to regular passenger service on 1 June 1865, followed by goods trains on 8 or 14 November 1865. The Swansea section opened on 9 November 1865 to mineral traffic started on the Swansea line, although volumes were small at first. The failure of the financing scheme had forced the Llanelly company into borrowing at high rates of interest. Moreover, the poor income on the Carmarthen line further reduced the Company's trading situation. The New Lines section of the Llanelly Company, which was separately financed, was plunged into financial difficulty, and it went into administration in January 1867. Passenger operation on the Swansea line started on 14 December 1867. The first through train from Llandovery to Swansea ran on 1 January 1868. The Penclawdd branch from Gower Road at the same time to serve local collieries (and later the Elba steel works).Gwyn Briwnant Jones and Denis Dunstone, The Origins of the LMS in South Wales, Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1999, The construction of the new lines obliged the Llanelly company to borrow large sums of money at crippling interest rates, and it was soon in a desperate financial situation. In July 1867 Richard Moon of the LNWR visited and discussed the possibility of help from his company; in exchange they would get running powers over the Llanelly network. The lease of the Vale of Towy line to the Llanelly company was due to be renegotiated, and the LNWR jointly took on the new lease with the Llanelly Company; the LNWR paid off some of the Llanelly's debts, and secured the running powers, getting LNWR access to Swansea and Carmarthen. The Llanelly's New Lines Company was in receivership, being unable to service its debts, and the New Lines were rescued by being worked by the LNWR from 1 July 1871. The Great Western Railway was alarmed that the LNWR now had access to Swansea, and quickly took steps to take over the Llanelly company's Original Lines from 1 January 1873. Thus the Llanelly company ceased to control its network, and the LNWR had acquired the New Lines and the GWR controlled the Original Lines. The lease of the Vale of Towy Railway was joint between the LNWR and the GWR, and it was converted to full joint ownership by the GWR and LNWR by Act of 28 July 1884. The Llanelly Company, now only the owner, but not operator, of the Original Lines, was fully absorbed by the GWR 1 July 1889. Pembroke and Tenby Railway In 1858 the South Wales Railway had been released from its obligation to build a branch line to Pembroke. Local people were disappointed at this, and they determined to build their own line from Pembroke Dockyard to Tenby. They obtained the Royal Assent on 21 July 1859, incorporating the South Wales, Pembroke and Tenby Junction Railway. It was to be a narrow (standard) gauge line, incompatible with the broad gauge of the South Wales Railway. In 1861 the company changed its name to the Pembroke and Tenby Railway. The line opened on 30 July 1863, and was worked by contractors.M R C Price, The Pembroke and Tenby Railway, Oakwood Press, Headington, 1986, While this was a useful start, it was obvious that an isolated line was of limited value. As a narrow (standard) gauge line the P&TR; regarded the South Wales Railway (by now part of the Great Western Railway) as unfriendly, and it sought to connect with the other narrow gauge lines at Carmarthen. The Pembroke and Tenby Act of 17 July 1864 authorised an extension from Tenby to Whitland, and also a west curve at Carmarthen, allowing through running from Whitland into Carmarthen Town to meet the Manchester and Milford Railway there. Capital for the work was set at ¬£200,000. The Whitland extension was opened to the public on 4 September 1866; there was a separate station at Whitland, alongside the Great Western Railway station. However the means of running from Whitland to Carmarthen required the Great Western Railway to alter its broad gauge track to mixed gauge, to enable the running of the P&TR; trains; the GWR did not hasten to facilitate this incursion, and the P&TR; directors considered building an independent line from Whitland to Carmarthen, and obtained Parliamentary powers in 1866. This would have given the P&TR; unrestricted access to the standard gauge lines at Carmarthen. As these were friendly to the rival London and North Western Railway, this had the potential to admit the LNWR to the West Wales area, an extremely unwelcome outcome for the GWR. At length it agreed to give the necessary access over its own route, by converting the up line between Whitland and Carmarthen to narrow gauge, leaving the down line broad: there were thus two single lines side by side. This was the first occasion when any GWR broad gauge track was converted to narrow. The Pembroke and Tenby Railway ran its first goods trains to Carmarthen on 1 June 1868, and passenger services started in August 1869. In May 1872, the GWR altered the track gauge of its lines in South Wales to standard gauge, and this eliminated the benefit of the P&TR; running independent trains between Whitland and Carmarthen. From 1 August 1872, P&TR; coaches were attached to GWR trains at Whitland; these trains called at Carmarthen Junction and were detached there and worked forward to Carmarthen Town station. The Pembroke and Tenby Railway was leased by the GWR on 1 July 1896 and finally absorbed by it a year later. Gwendraeth Valleys Railway In 1864 the impecunious Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway promoted two branch lines from Kidwelly, and one, known as the Lime Line was authorised by Act of 28 April 1864. The C&CR; hoped to attract investment for the construction, but it was disappointed, and the powers were transferred to the Gwendraeth Valleys Railway by Act of 30 July 1866. This new concern opened a short length of the Lime Line from Kidwelly to Mynydd-y- Garreg in 1868; the line was broad gauge. After a period of dormancy, the Gwendraeth Valleys Railway was reopened in 1872 as a standard gauge line. The short line was worked by the neighbouring Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway by agreement of 30 November 1876.R W Miller, The Burry Port & Gwendreath Valley Railway and its Antecedent Canals: Volume Two: The Railway and Dock, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2009, Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway The Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal and Tramroad Company operated a canal serving collieries; the tramways were short branches of the canal serving pits nearby. It saw that its canal was obsolescent and it obtained an Act on 5 July 1865 to convert the canal to a railway. It was to be called the Kidwelly and Burry Port Railway Company, but in 1866 it merged with the Burry Port Harbour Company and changed the name to the Burry Port and Gwendreath Valley Railway. (The spelling \\"Gwendreath\\" was an error by the Company's Parliamentary legal advisors.) The conversion was completed and the line was opened as far as Pontyberem on 23 June 1869. The short Carway branch opened about the end of 1870 and that to the Star Colliery at Trimsaran followed in June 1872. The main line was completed to the foot of the Hirwaen Isaf incline, a mile short of Cwm Mawr in 1870. For many years there was no passenger service on the BP&GV; line, but about the end of 1898 a workmen's service started to run, from Burry Port and calling at Trimsaran Road bridge at Morfa, and later from Tycoch Junction where the Gwendraeth Valley line connected.Raymond E Bowen, Burry Port and Gwendreath Valley Railway and its Antecedent Canals: volume 1: the Canals, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2001, Whitland and Taf Vale Railway Railways in West Wales in 1876 John Owen was the operator of a slate quarry at Glogue, north of Whitland; he formed an alliance with an engineer, James W Szlumper to form a standard gauge railway connection from Glogue down to the main line at Whitland. A standard gauge line was contemplated, although the GWR main line was still broad gauge. The Taf Vale was friendly with the Pembroke and Tenby Railway, which had Parliamentary approval to build from Whitland to Carmarthen. The Taf Vale promoters hoped that this might give them a standard gauge outlet. On 12 July 1869 the Whitland and Taf Vale Railway obtained its authorising Act of Parliament, with capital of ¬£37,000.The Taf Vale is unconnected with the Taff Vale Railway in the Cardiff area. The line was opened as far as Glogue to goods and minerals trains on 24 March 1873. By this time the former South Wales Railway main line had been converted to standard gauge, so the issue of mixed gauge track to Whitland station no longer applied. On 29 April 1873 the Board decided to proceed with construction to Crymmych by directly employed labour, and the short extension opened early in July 1874. The line was opened to passengers on 12 July 1875. There was a connecting road service to Cardigan and to Newport.M R C Price, The Whitland and Cardigan Railway, Oakwood Press, Usk, 1976 GWR Gauge conversion The inconvenience of the break of gauge between broad gauge and narrow gauge lines was becoming more marked over time, and at length in 1871 the decision was taken by the Great Western Railway to convert the gauge of all the broad gauge track in Wales. The work was executed in April 1872. On the night of Tuesday 30 April the up line from New Milford and Grange Court was closed, and single line working of a reduced train service instituted on the down line. Considerable technical preparation had been made including oiling and freeing of the bolts; much of the track was the GWR pattern longitudinal timber track, but some Barlow rail sections had been replaced with rails on cross sleepers, and because of the use of fang bolts this was much more laborious to convert. The up line was ready for narrow gauge traffic on 12 May and all broad gauge rolling stock was cleared from the Welsh lines; this included the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway, and an inspector was sent to verify that this had been done. The reduced train service was operated over the single up line, and sidings at certain station had been previously narrowed to allow passenger trains to be shunted to pass opposing trains, as there was no ordinary crossing loop for a few days. During this time goods trains were not run on the line under conversion, but as far as possible goods traffic was worked by alternative routes where they were available east of Swansea Conversion of the down line was complete on 22 May and the following day a skeleton service was run at reduced speed. Private owners' broad gauge wagons were returned to their home station; in many cases there was not enough siding accommodation for them, and they were turned off the line as close to the home as possible. Following the gauge conversion, the opportunity was taken to enlarge the facilities at the cramped Neyland site; considerable removal of rock was necessary to make the space, and the new layout was commissioned in 1876. From Narberth Road to Goodwick In 1871 Edward Cropper and Joseph Babington Macaulay obtained a Board of Trade certificate to build a standard gauge line from a slate quarry at Rosebush, about 8 miles north of Narberth Road station on the South Wales Railway main line. The line was named the Narberth Road and Maenclochog Railway, and it opened in January 1876, and from September 1876 passengers were carried. The business was not profitable, and the railway closed at the end of 1882, but it was reopened in December 1884, closing once again in 1888. In 1878 it had been thought that the way to achieve profitability was to link to Fishguard Bay, and in that year the Rosebush and Fishguard Railway was authorised, to build from Rosebush to Goodwick; the reference to Fishguard is to the bay; the settlement named Fishguard is at the south-eastern end of Fishguard Bay, and Goodwick is at the north-western end; it was to Goodwick that the line was directed. It proved impossible to raise the money to build the line, but the scheme was revived in 1884, with the same result, and again in 1886 also failed. In 1891 a Colonel Joseph Okell stepped in with his personal money, but in January 1894 he was declared bankrupt.Peter Dale, Pembroke, Cardigan & Montgomery's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 2007, Llanelly and Mynydd Mawr Railway The idea of building a standard gauge line from Llanelly to Mynydd Mawr was revived in 1872; volumes of mineral extraction had increased and enhanced transport from the collieries to the quay at Llanelly was highly desirable. The Llanelly and Mynydd Mawr Railway was authorised by Act of Parliament on 19 July 1875, with share capital of ¬£60,000. The new line was to be 13 miles in length, approaching Llanelly harbour from the north west, and crossing the South Wales Railway main line by a bridge. Raising the capital to build the line was extremely difficult, and the company was on the point of abandoning the scheme in October 1879. However at the last moment it was decided to continue, and the contractor John Waddell agreed to construct the line, taking a large proportion of his price in shares in the company. He started work on 26 April 1880 and in January 1881 he agreed to work the line for five years, for 70% of gross receipts in year 1, then 60%, then 50% in subsequent years. The line was opened on 1 January 1883 although some mineral and excursion traffic appears to have run before that date. Regular public passenger services were never run on the line, although colliers' trains were operated at the turn of the century. Two steam locomotives were in use from the beginning. For some years the profitability of the Company was poor, but Waddell opened a new mine on the line in 1887, and traffic improved considerably. The harbour at Llanelly used by the line was prone to silting, and as the mineral trade increased, and the size of shipping also grew, reducing the attractiveness of Llanelly Harbour; many companies transferred their business to more modern facilities at Swansea. In 1896 the Harbour Commissioners obtained Parliamentary powers to extend and improve the harbour by the construction of a North Dock. This opened in December 1903, special arrangements being made to carry the L&MMR; line across the mouth of the entrance by a swing bridge. Whitland and Cardigan Railway The Whitland and Taf Vale Railway saw that Cardigan was important commercial centre and close enough to build a connecting line. On 2 August 1877 the Company obtained the Royal Assent for its Bill to do so, and it changed its name to the Whitland and Cardigan Railway. Construction was slow due to a shortage of subscriptions for shares, and difficulty in obtaining necessary land. Opening took place at last on 1 September 1886; the Great Western Railway worked the line from the outset. Absorption by the Great Western Railway was on the agenda as the next step, and this was authorised by a section of the Great Western Railway Act 1890, dated 4 August, taking retrospective effect from 1 July 1890. The line was now simply the Cardigan branch of the GWR. Fishguard Bay Railway and Pier Company The concept of reaching Fishguard Bay continued to be attractive as a financial speculation, and Joseph Rowlands, a Birmingham solicitor, and James Cartland, an industrialist, together acquired a majority shareholding in the uncompleted North Pembrokeshire and Fishguard Railway Company. They obtained a fresh Act of Parliament on 29 June 1893 to incorporate the Fishguard Bay Railway and Pier Company. This was authorised to extend from the intended terminal of the North Pembrokeshire line, to Goodwick. A pier or breakwater was to be constructed as well as a hotel, and running powers over the North Pembrokeshire line were granted. The company's capital was to be ¬£120,000. The Waterford and Wexford Railway was engaged in improving the harbour facilities at Rosslare, (formerly known as Greenore or Ballygeary and negotiations took place to combine the activities on both sides of the ferry crossing. This culminated in the incorporation of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company by Act of 31 July 1894.W M J Williams, North Pembrokeshire and Fishguard Railway, in Railway Magazine, September 1899 Rowlands and Cartland purchased the derelict Maenclochog Railway in 1894 for ¬£50,000. The line was in a very poor state of repair, and much had to be done in the way of improvements, but goods traffic started on 13 March 1895 followed by passenger trains on 11 April 1895. There were five up and four down passenger trains daily to and from the end of the line at Letterston, with a coach connection from Goodwick. Rowlands now approached the Great Western Railway, intending to sell his Welsh network to the GWR. The original Maenclochog line was very inadequately engineered for operation by the larger company, and included a gradient of 1 in 27, and Rowlands' approach was unsuccessful. He next promoted a Bill in Parliament to build a line from the Maenclochog line to Carmarthen, where a connection with the rival London and North Western Railway would be possible. The Bill was passed in 1895 and Rowlands prepared plans for further schemes including a line to Swansea, and in 1896 to Aberdare and make junctions with the LNWR, the Midland Railway and the GWR en route; sale to any of those railways was now a theoretical possibility. The Great Western Railway had long considered revival of the original South Wales Railway's scheme to reach Fishguard Bay securing a share of the transatlantic shipping trade. The possibility of the LNWR acquiring access to the West Wales network motivated the GWR to step in; it acquired control of the North Pembrokeshire and Fishguard Railway in February 1898. In May 1898 an agreement was concluded between the GWR, the Great Southern and Western Railway in Ireland, and the Fishguard and Rosslare Company: the Fishguard and Rosslare would complete the harbours in both places, and would build a railway from Rosslare to Waterford, linking in to the Irish railway network; and it would provide steamers. The GS&WR; would work the necessary connecting railways on the Irish side; and the GWR undertook to make a new line from Clarbeston Road to Fishguard Harbour, and work the Welsh railways. The GWR was also obliged to provide \\"an effective steamboat service\\" between Waterford and Milford or Fishguard, in addition to the Rosslare service. The agreement was ratified by Parliament in 1899, and the acquisition by the GWR of the North Pembrokeshire line was included. On 1 July 1899 the GWR opened the extension from Letterston to Goodwick (later named Fishguard and Goodwick) station. The Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours company became a joint enterprise of the GWR and the GS&WR.; The company had considerable construction obligations on the Irish side. Fishguard Harbour Although Fishguard Bay had been reached, there was not a satisfactory harbour there, and the railway approach was still over the very steeply graded Rosebush line. The town of Fishguard is at the south-east end of Fishguard Bay, but the new terminus was to be on the north-west side, where it is sheltered by hills up to 300 feet high. There were sheer cliffs there and it was necessary to blast a terrace for the harbour works. Together with reclamation by tipping the excavated rock into the sea, an area of twenty-seven acres was made available for quay 1,120 feet long, and the new railway station. A breakwater, 2,000 feet long, 300 wide at the base and 70 at the top, and 80 high, was formed. More than two million tons of rock was excavated. Considerable numbers of houses were constructed by the GWR to accommodate staff, as the small local communities had not enough housing for the large terminal activity.John Morris, The Railways of Pembrokeshire, H G Walters (Publishers) Ltd, Tenby, 1981, On 30 August 1906 the promised new route was opened: from Clarbeston Road (on the Neyland line) to Letterston Junction (on the North Pembroke line), as well as an extension from the Goodwick terminus to Fishguard Harbour. The ferry service between Fishguard Harbour and Rosslare was started at the same time. The new line was 11 miles in length with a steepest gradient of 1 in 108, but two miles of the former North Pembrokeshire line between Letterston and Goodwick were at 1 in 50. The Clarbeston Road and Letterston Railway had cost ¬£215,801. Three new turbine steamers, St. George, St. David, and St. Patrick, each of approximately 2,500 gross tons and capable of knots, were provided for the new service; the crossing time was three hours for a 54-mile passage. A fourth vessel, St. Andrew, was added two years later. Day and night train services were established in each direction, the boat trains being allowed hours for the 261 miles between Paddington and Fishguard Harbour. The journey time from London to Cork was 13 hours (allowing for the 25-minute difference in time observed until 1915).H Fayle, The Jubilee of the Fishguard & Rosslare Route: II, in the Railway Magazine, June 1956 The run from Paddington to Fishguard was covered without a stop several times each way in September and October 1907 by London and Killarney Day Excursion trains in a little less than five hours, the longest non-stop run ever made on the Great Western. At first a single line section was operated at Treffgarne and through Spittal Tunnel as the excavation for double track had not been completed. This was finalised on 17 December 1906 when ordinary double-line working was instituted throughout the new line. The section from Manorowen to Goodwick, on the original North Pembrokeshire line, was doubled on 5 May 1907. \\"New Milford\\" resumed its proper name of Neyland, and the ferry activity there ceased, as the Waterford service was diverted to Fishguard from September 1906, mainly carrying cattle and goods. Towards 1909 the steamer traffic between Great Britain and America became increasingly competitive, and the traditional use of Liverpool was questioned, if a shorter crossing time could be achieved elsewhere. White Star liners had started to use Holyhead, and the Cunard Company arranged to land its passengers at Fishguard, forty miles nearer New York and within five hours of London. The first ship to call was the Mauretania, then the biggest and fastest liner afloat. Having left New York at 10 am on 25 August and called at Queenstown (now Cobh), she dropped anchor at Fishguard at 1:15 pm on the 30th. The mails and passengers were in London by 8 o'clock, the mails at 6:40.G A Sekon, The Ocean Mails Line, in the Railway Magazine, October 1909 Early in 1910 the time was further reduced by the omission of the Queenstown call, and the Cunard liners continued to use Fishguard regularly from 6 to 8 times a month until the outbreak of World War I, three or four special trains to London usually being run off each boat. The frequent \\"ordinary\\" special mail and passenger trains usually did the journey from Fishguard to London in about hours with a stop at Cardiff. Reliance on the difficult North Pembrokeshire route between Fishguard and Letterston Junction was seen as a serious limitation, and in 1903 a new route on an improved alignment with easier gradients was designed. This would have been hugely expensive, and the GWR board waited to see how successful the Fishguard route was to be. Its success as an ocean terminal prompted the GWR to start construction. Progress was slow, and in fact World War I intervened and the work was never completed.The abandoned earthworks may be discerned in aerial mapping, heading due north from Letterston Junction. On the outbreak of World War I it was inevitable that the transatlantic trade would be suspended, and the last such call was made when the Lusitania left on 14 September 1914. Grouping of the railways Railway lines in West Wales in 1923The Railways Act 1921 required that the main line railways of Great Britain should be \\"grouped\\" into four larger units; three of these were new entities, but the Great Western Railway was dominant in its area, and absorbed a large number of small concerns, the name Great Western Railway continuing in use. (Outside the area under consideration, several other railways were constituents of the post-1923 GWR.) The London and North Western Railway and the Midland Railway were constituents of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The grouping took place at the beginning of 1923.O S Nock, History of the Great Western Railway, volume 3: 1923 - 1947, Ian Allan Limited, Shepperton, 1967 reprinted 1982, Thus in 1922 the railways in the area under consideration were: Railways already acquired or built by the Great Western Railway * The original South Wales Railway main line, Gloucester to Neyland; amalgamated with the GWR in 1863; * The Milford Railway from Johnston to Milford Haven, purchased by the GWR in 1896; * The line from Letterston to Goodwick, opened by the GWR in 1899; * The new main line from Clarbeston Road to Goodwick, opened by the GWR in 1906; * The Llanelly Railway and Dock Company; the original network, between Llanelly and Llandeilo had been absorbed by the GWR in 1873; * The Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway: open from Carmarthen to Llandyssil only, and absorbed by the GWR in 1892; it had been extended by the GWR itself to Newcastle Emlyn, opening in 1895; * The Rosebush line; the Maenclochog Railway and the North Pembrokeshire and Fishguard Railway had been acquired by the GWR in 1898. * The Whitland and Cardigan Railway; the Company had been absorbed by the GWR in 1890. * The Pembroke and Tenby Railway; from Whitland to Pembroke Dock, the company had been amalgamated with the GWR in 1897. * Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway; sold to the GWR in 1922; * Manchester and Milford Railway: Pencader Junction to Aberystwyth; absorbed by the GWR in 1911. Joint lines * The Fishguard and Rosslare Harbours company was already vested jointly in the GWR and the GS&WR.; Independent lines at Grouping * The Llanelly and Mynydd Mawr Railway was independent until the Grouping process, when it was absorbed by the Great Western Railway. In its final year of independence in 1922 the L&MMR; paid a dividend of 6% on its ordinary share capital of ¬£59,300. * The short Gwendraeth Valleys Railway; owned by the Kidwelly Tinplate Company. * The extension lines of the Llanelly Railway and Dock Company (Llandeilo Junction to Gwili Junction and Pontardulais to Swansea) were in the hands of the LNWR. * The Vale of Towy Railway had been vested in the GWR and the LNWR jointly in 1884, and at the Grouping the joint ownership transferred to the GWR and the LMS jointly. After 1923 From the end of World War I the political situation in Ireland was dominated by the Irish War of Independence, and by the summer of 1921 it had drifted into a situation little short of civil war. As a result, traffic on the Fishguard to Rosslare route had fallen to a fraction of its former volume. The treaty of 6 December 1921 formally ended the hostilities, although outbreaks of violence continued; nevertheless matters seemed to be moving towards stability by the summer of 1923. The Irish Mail service via Fishguard and Rosslare was resumed on 17 September 1923, although through carriages were run from Aldershot to Fishguard, \\"presumably to facilitate troop movements if necessary\\". At the time of the Grouping, the Government had appealed to the railways to undertake as much work as possible for the relief of unemployment, and the GWR proposed a new branch line from Mathry Road, on the Fishguard line, to St Davids, a distance of about ten miles, at a cost of ¬£350,000. (Other lines elsewhere were proposed.) The Company asked for a Government grant, stating that \\"there appears to be little prospect... of the receipts from the lines being more than sufficient to cover working expenses\\". Only a tiny population would be benefitted by the line, and the scheme was not progressed further. The Rosebush line was relaid in 1923, but passenger services stopped in 1937, and the line west of Puncheston closed completely on 3 November 1942; east of that point the line closed on 16 May 1949. (Letterston was served by goods trains until 1 March 1965). The local production of anthracite on the Mynydd Mawr line fell in the years following 1923, substantially reducing the traffic on the former L&MMR; line. Moreover, the size of shipping commonly used increased considerably over this period, and the limitations of sea access for large vessels to Llanelly docks also reduced the activity there. GWR diesel railcars started operation from Swansea to Whitland in 1936. Trecwn depot Passenger services over the Rosebush line had ended in 1937, since when goods services had been progressively truncated. The Army had established a camp at Trecwn during the Boer War, and during World War I the site was converted to an isolation hospital; a siding was laid to enable servicemen to be conveyed by train direct from Fishguard. In 1938 the site was again made use of, now as a Royal Naval Armaments Depot, and an extensive internal narrow gauge railway system was laid, eventually amounting to over 18 miles in extent. The stub of branch line serving Trecwn and Letterston continued in use until March 1965, when Letterston goods depot closed. As late as 1962 a workmen's passenger service operated from Fishguard to Trecwn, ending on 3 August that year. The depot was finally decommissioned in 1996, and the following year the site was purchased by Omega Pacific for industrial use, but rail connection ceased permanently. Nationalisation In 1948 the Great Western Railway was nationalised, in common with the other public railways of Great Britain, and the line was now owned by British Railways. The ownership of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railway and Harbour company thus became joint between British Railways and C√≥ras Iompair √âireann, the latter having been established by the Transport Act, 1944 of the Republic of Ireland. The company owned about 104 miles of railway, of which one mile was in Wales. By 1950 the L&MMR; line crossing the GWR main line was out of use, as sea trade at Llanelly had vanished; onward conveyance of local minerals was now by rail alone. Modernisation By the 1960s British Railways gave more strategic thought to the future; local passenger and goods traffic in rural areas had collapsed, and the coal mining industry was changing considerably, but investment was beginning to be available in new railway equipment. In fact the first diesel multiple unit stock reached Carmarthen in 1957 and its deployment was much extended from 1959. Train service pattern after 1962 In 1962 the Neyland route was still regarded as the main line over Milford Haven. There were eleven passenger services each way west of Carmarthen, of which eight conveyed through carriages from Paddington. Only the Fishguard boat trains had refreshment cars. Four trains conveyed through carriages from Paddington to Pembroke Dock, three to Neyland, two to Milford Haven and three to Fishguard. One of the Milford Haven trains was formed of a composite sleeper only, attached to the 00:45 newspaper train from Paddington. The Pembroke Coast Express ran to Pembroke Dock and the Capitals United Express ran to Pembroke Dock with a portion for Neyland. Carmarthen had another nine trains eastward, mostly to Swansea but also to Derby and Birmingham, and a 22:50 to Ferryside, consisting of one coach attached to a parcels train. A milk train ran daily from Whitland and Carmarthen to Kensington (Olympia) and Wood Lane, and there was a daily fish train from Milford Haven to Severn Tunnel Junction or Carmarthen. Line closures, and openings A branch line to the new Gulf Oil refinery at Waterston was opened on 21 August 1960;The refinery commenced production on 2 November 1960. it made a junction with the Milford Haven line at Herbrandston Junction. A further branch was opened to a new Amoco refinery at Robeston on 20 February 1974. The Hebrandston branch closed on 10 November 1984. Passenger services stopped on The Whitland and Cardigan branch on 10 September 1962, followed by freight in 1963. The Cardigan branch closed to passenger traffic on 10 September 1962, and to goods from 27 May 1963. On 6 April 1964 the stopping service from Clarbeston Road to Fishguard ceased. The line from Johnston to Neyland closed on 14 June 1964. The line had survived until then because of the extensive locomotive and carriage servicing facilities there (from the 1876 expansion), but modern traction enabled the work to be carried out elsewhere, in Swansea and Carmarthen. Nonetheless Pembrokeshire escaped lightly from the 1963 Beeching Report as none of the remaining three branches, to Fishguard, Milford Haven, and Pembroke Dock, were proposed for closure. The Neyland line reopened briefly, from 19 May 1966; construction materials for oil refinery construction were brought in by rail to Neyland; the work finished and the line closed finally in May 1968. The line from Clarbeston Road to Fishguard was singled on 17 May 1971. A Motorail service was established from 19 June 1965, conveying accompanied cars from Fishguard and Goodwick station to London (Kensington Olympia), principally used by customers of the Irish ferry; the service continued in use until 16 September 1982. The Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company had become jointly owned by CI√â and British Railways. In January 1979 Sealink UK was established as a subsidiary of British Railways, and Sealink was sold to Sea Containers Limited on 27 July 1984. The Company changed its name and ownership several times, eventually becoming Stena Line. From 1979 Iarnr√≥d √âireann was established as a subsidiary of CI√â, so that Stena Line and I√â were the joint owners of F&RR;&H;, which remains the position to the present day (2015). Both curves at Carmarthen leading to the station were singled in 1985. In 1986 the line through Gowerton was singled between Cockett West and Duffryn West (approaching Llanelli) as part of the Swansea multiple aspect signalling scheme. With the increase in train frequency in subsequent years the single- track section had become an operational difficulty, and double track was reinstated on 8 April 2013. Topography Easy gradients from Carmarthen but after Sarnau the gradient steepens against westbound trains, then drops to St Clears and Whitland. After Cardigan Junction the gradient steepens to 1 in 101 against westbound trains; approaching Clarbeston Road the gradient falls. Approaching Haverfordwest and beyond it numerous reverse curves and changes of gradient, the double track ends at Johnston, only six intermediate stations to Johnston. Neyland line falls continuously at up to 1 in 75. Milford Haven branch also falls continuously, both branches originally intended to be double track but remained single.

Australia Within the Australian Army, combat service support is provided to combat elements at various levels: first line (organic to battalion or regimental level), second line (at brigade level), and third line (at formation or higher). Thus, for example an infantry unit such as the 5th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment will include a logistics company which fills supply, transportation and maintenance functions, while a combat brigade, such as the 7th Brigade, will be supported by a combat service support battalion such as the 7th Combat Service Support Battalion.

It is a shrub or tree with elliptical to egg-shaped leaves with the narrower end towards the base, panicles of white, greenish white or yellowish flowers and purple to bluish black, spherical to oval fruit. Description Halfordia kendack is a shrub or tree that trpically grows to a height of , the trunk with a diameter of and often flanged at the base. It has grey or pale yellowish-brown bark with corky pustules and is often rough and wrinkled. The smaller branches are smooth, green and about thick. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, elliptical to egg-shaped or lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide and more or less sessile or on a petiole up to long. The leaf tapers to the base and has a rounded or tapered tip and new leaves have a noticeable aromatic scent resembling eau de cologne. There are many conspicuous, closely spaced oil dots. The flowers are arranged in panicles long, each flower about in diameter on a pedicel long. The sepals are long and the petals white, greenish white or yellowish and long with short, soft hairs pressed against the back. Flowering occurs from January to May and the fruit is a purple to bluish black, spherical to oval drupe long that is present in most months. Taxonomy The genus Halfordia was first formally described in 1865 by Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae and the first species he described was Halfordia drupifera, now considered a nomen illegitimum. In 1860, Xavier Montrouzier described Eriostemon kendack in M√©moires de l'Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences, Belles-Lettres et Arts de Lyon, and in 1911, Andr√© Guillaumin changed the name to Halfordia kendack in Notulae Systematicae. Halfordia is named after George Britton Halford and \\"kendack\\" is an indigenous name for this tree in New Caledonia. Distribution and habitat Kerosenewood grows in monsoon woodland and rainforest in coastal and inland areas from sea level to an altitude of . It is found in New Caledonia, New Guinea and eastern Australia. In Australia it occurs from the Torres Strait Islands to the Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, south to Iluka in New South Wales, including on the Mcpherson and Tweed Ranges. Ecology The hard seed is surrounded by pulp, which is eaten by a variety of birds, such as the green catbird, topknot pigeon and wompoo fruit dove. Germination from seeds can be difficult, often erratic. Uses Before the development of fibreglass and carbon fibre, the timber of this species was used in the manufacture of fishing rods. The oily, flexible timber is hard, weighing 1100 kg per cubic metre. This plant is gaining popularity in horticulture. The wood is highly flammable, and chips of wood may be used to start a fire, even when wet, hence one of the common names, \\"kerosene wood\\".

In JazzTimes Jeff Tamarkin wrote \\"Manu Katch√© must be the least egotistical drummer on the planet. Although he‚Äôs rarely out of earshot on Playground, and the vision is clearly his, there‚Äôs not a moment when he hogs the spotlight ... most of the star turns go to the Norwegian hornmen, Trygve Seim on tenor and soprano saxophones and trumpeter Mathias Eick, and to the Polish pianist, Marcin Wasilewski. But they too keep things in check, and Playground, despite brief flashes of intensity, often teeters toward the smooth-jazz chasm‚Äîit never quite falls in, but it comes awfully close\\".Tamarkin, J., JazzTimes Review, November 2007 - accessed October 24, 2016 On All About Jazz John Kelman noted \\"Playground is, like its predecessor, first and foremost an outstandingly honest record and proves, yet again, that accessible music needn't be lightweight or predictable\\".Kelman, J., All About Jazz Review, accessed October 24, 2016  Track listing  All compositions by Manu Katch√©. # \\"Lo\\" - 6:25 # \\"Pieces of Emotion\\" - 4:13 # \\"Song for Her\\" - 6:24 # \\"So Groovy\\" - 5:50 # \\"Morning Joy\\" - 5:27 # \\"Motion\\" - 5:14 # \\"Project 58\\" - 6:13 # \\"Snapshot\\" - 4:53 # \\"Possible Thought\\" - 6:03 # \\"Inside Game\\" - 5:06 # \\"Clubbing\\" - 7:03 # \\"Song for Her (Var.)\\" - 6:22  Personnel  *Manu Katch√© - drums *Mathias Eick - trumpet *Trygve Seim - tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone *Marcin Wasilewski - piano * Slawomir Kurkiewicz - bass *David Torn - guitar (tracks 1 & 12) Production and design *Engineered by James A.
