He is an archaeology Professor at Simon Fraser University and Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Archaeological Science, a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (London) and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Richards has published more than 300 research articles (ncluding in journals such as Nature, Science, and PNAS). His research focuses on studying the diets diet evolution and migrations of past humans and animals using various techniques such as isotope analysis and radiocarbon dating. His work is highly cited and has gathered media coverage.  Education  Richards completed his Bachelor of Arts (with Honours) and received his Certificate in Liberal Arts from Simon Fraser University in 1992. He completed his Masters degree in 1994 from the same institution before moving to U.K. for his doctoral studies. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Oxford in 1998.  Career  Right after his doctoral studies, he accepted a position as Post- Doctoral Research Assistant at the Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art at Oxford University. From 2000 till 2005, Richards was associated with University of Bradford, funded through a Wellcome Trust University Award, first as a lecturer, and was later promoted to Reader and then Professor. In 2004 he joined the newly founded Department of Human Evolution at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (MPI-EVA) in Leipzig, Germany as a Professor (W2) until 2009. During that time he also held a part-time Professorship in Archaeology at the University of Durham (UK). In 2009, Richards moved to the Department of Anthroplogy at the University of British Columbia (UBC), and held a part-time Professorship at the MPI-EVA. Richards was Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies in the Faculty of Arts at UBC from 2012 to 2016. He then moved to the Department of Archaeology at Simon Fraser University as a Professor and Canada Research Chair in Archaeological Science (Tier 1) in 2016.  Research and work  Richard‚Äôs major research areas include bioarcheology, stable isotopes, and archaeological science. He has worked studying the diet evolution of humans in the past, focusing especially on early modern humans and Neanderthals. He published his first article in 2000 about Neanderthal diets using stable isotopes, followed by a number of papers, including a review paper in 2008 in PNAS. The isotope analysis characterized Neanderthals as true carnivores and the results pointed out to the fact that they were effective predators and hunters instead of acquiring protein through scavenging. His research on Neanderthal diet was featured in the New York Times. He has also used strontium isotope analysis to study the landscape use by the early hominins. Richards conducted studies on cave bears using isotopic analysis and found that these bears had nitrogen isotopes values similar but slightly higher than those of herbivores. His research led to the discovery of the fact that these European cave bears were capable to altering their diets to become omnivores or even carnivores. Richards and his students have also conducted considerable research on the diets of people around the world in the Holocene period. A particular focus of this research has been the application of isotopes to study the change of diets associated with the introduction of farming and animal husbandry in Europe and China (the Mesolithic/Neolithic transition). He found, with colleagues, that there was a relatively abrupt change in diet when Neolithic artifacts and foods arrived in northwest Europe ca. 4000 BC. In 2002, Richards co-authored an article about the Medieval Wharram Percy population. They studied the measurements of the nitrogen and carbon isotope analysis conducted on the population to study the weaning age and impact of weaning on the population. The measurements and the data collected traced the weaning age of the Medieval Wharram Percy population to 2 years old. They also discussed the dietary changes in children after weaning. While researching on medieval era and the dietary preferences of the past people, Richards co-wrote an article in 2005 titled ‚ÄúFast or feast: reconstructing diet in later medieval England by stable isotope analysis‚Äù and designed a pilot study to analyze the isotopic variations in medieval population of England. He observed the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis conducted in three different medieval sites in England and found that the values differed significantly from the isotope analysis values collected from medieval sites other than England. His results indicated an important impact of the medieval fasting on everyday livelihood of the populations. Richards has also developed new methods of isotope analysis, especially focusing on the application of sulphur isotopes as dietary and migration indicators. Current research includes developing new isotope systems for dietary and migration studies using isotope analysis (including compound-specific measurements and non-traditional isotopes such as zinc) to explore and catalogue the range and nature of human dietary adaptations throughout the Holocene, and developing and applying isotope analysis in forensics.

The Hampson family  Named after the regional Tasmanian town of Westbury, the historic quilt was created by sisters Mary Hampson (26 June 1868 ‚Äì 1944) and Jane Hampson (13 October 1873 ‚Äì 10 April 1950), possibly with the assistance of other family members such as sister Hannah (died 18 October 1952) over the years 1900 to 1903. They were the unmarried daughters of farmer John Hampson and Mary Ann Parker, and the grand-daughters of emancipated convicts.  Biography  The Hampsons were a long-established farming family, living on the farm \\"Fernbank\\" at Osmastin, outside of Westbury towards the Great Western Tiers. There were seven siblings and it is likely only one ever married. As no descendants were able to be traced, the quilt eventually passed through the hands of a Westbury neighbour, Mary Gray, who had assisted the last Hampson sibling in his later years. She did not have wall space to display it, so gave it to the Misses Genevieve and Myra Fitzpatrick, who hung it on the wall of their historic hostelry, the Fitzpatrick Inn, located on the Bass Highway at the eastern entrance to Westbury.  Quilt provenance  The Westbury Quilt is an historic quilt, completed in a domestic setting by two sisters from the Hampson family. Assistance may have come from a third sister Hannah, or other members of the family. The red cotton fabric could have been dyed at home, as the natural bright red colour known as turkey red or madder red comes from rubia tinctorum, an introduced plant. Construction of the quilt included patchwork, appliqu√©, embroidery, and piece work, with many delicate and intricate stitches. The quilt would have been created by gaslight or candle- light, as electricity did not arrive in the district until the late 1920s. The completed size is 223.0 h x 191.0 w cm and it is backed with pink flannelette. There are a number of panels with dates. The earliest panel with a date is the central motif featuring Queen Victoria, with the embroidered words \\"Good Queen Victoria\\", surrounded by \\"a floral garland representing the Empire\\", dated 1900. The latest dated panel is 28 December 1903, but it is not known in what order the individual patches were worked. The scalloped edge is a series of floral shapes, finely stitched and added as a border on the completion of the front of the quilt, probably after the flannelette backing had been added. The panels depict scenes from the farming life of the Hampson family and the nearby villages. There are loved cows with the names \\"Polly\\" and \\"Kitty\\" and a pair of horses named \\"Bell\\" and \\"Colin\\". A thirteen hour clock bears the words \\"Lost time is never found again\\". The individual patches are rich with homilies, cautionary tales, theological virtues and proverbs, and \\"exhortations to decorous moral and social behaviour\\". These include: * \\"when a woman throws herself at a man's head, she seldom hits the mark\\" * \\"Don't spoil good tea in the making\\" * \\"Faith, Hope and Charity\\" * \\"Better to work and fail than to sleep one's life away\\" The quilt was displayed on the wall of the Fitzpatrick Inn until the late 1980s. It was then not seen for a number of years. When it was discovered, it was found in a room with a dead rat on the centre. The quilt was acquired for the national collection by the National Gallery of Australia, with the assistance of the Australian Textiles Fund 1990.  Legacy  The quilt was included in the national touring exhibition Everyday Art: Australian Folk Art which \\"celebrated the glories of everyday objects\\". Included in the tour was the Tasmanian Museum and Gallery in Hobart in 1999. At the time, it was called the \\"Hampson Quilt\\". To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Westbury Quilt, the craftswomen of the towns of Westbury, Hagley and Whitemore joined together to create a new quilt. Named the \\"Millennium Quilt\\", it is now on permanent display at the Meander Valley Council Chambers in Deloraine.  Further reading  * Rolfe, Margaret. (1987). Patchwork quilts in Australia.

Suryodarmo left Indonesia in 1994, moving to Braunschweig, Germany. She found work retouching photographs and planned to continue her studies in international relations. Following a chance meeting at the city's botanical gardens with Japanese Butoh choreographer Anzu Furukawa, Suryodarmo developed an interest in performance art. She studied sculpture and performance art at the Braunschweig University of Art under Furukawa, who she describes as her \\"biggest influence in thinking.\\" In addition to learning Butoh from Furukawa, Suryodarmo also learned choreography, costume design and staging. In 1996, she was part of the dance performance Kashya-kashya Muttiku with Yuko Negoro at FBZ in Braunschweig.Suryodarmo later took classes from performance artist Marina Abramoviƒá. Suryodarmo received a fine arts degree in 2001 and an MFA in performance art in 2002. She later worked as an assistant for Abramoviƒá. Suryodarmo performed as a \\"living installation\\" alongside her former professor during the 2003 Venice Biennale. Suryodarmo also studied time-based art with Mara Mattuschka. Art career After living in Germany for 20 years, Suryodarmo moved back to Indonesia in 2013. There she has worked towards popularising performance art in the country. Suryodarmo founded the performance art festival Undisclosed Territory in 2007 in her hometown of Solo. The annual festival includes workshops for youth featuring local artists. In 2012, she converted her home studio into Studio Plesungan, an art lab for Undisclosed Territory and performance art workshops. From 2013 to 2016, Suryodarmo served as guest lecturer at Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Yogyakarta. In 2017, Suryodarmo was the first woman to have the role of artistic director for the Jakarta Biennale. She had a solo exhibition at Museum Macan in 2020. Works Suryodarmo typically produces one or two new performances every year. Many of Suryodarmo's pieces are physically demanding, durational forms of performance art. Her use of repetitive motions in long performances creates meaning by stripping down movement and actions to their barest essentials. Rather than plan out her emotions for her pieces, Suryodarmo is \\"planning a platform of action with many considerations of thought.\\" Suryodarmo has said of her work, \\"I intend to touch the fluid border between the body and its environment through my art works. I aim to create a concentrated level of intensity without the use of narrative structures. ...I love it when a performance reaches a level of factual absurdity.\\" Aside from performance art, she also works in installation, video, and photography. She has performed throughout Europe and Asia as well as in North America. In a review of Suryodarmo's works, Michelle Antoinette wrote that her performance art is a \\"vehicle for coming to terms with conflicting aspects of her identity,\\" particularly as a woman within the context of Indonesian culture and cross-culturally as a resident of both Germany and Indonesia. In a review for ArtAsiaPacific, Eva McGovern-Basa writes that Suryodarmo's long durational pieces often involve repetitive actions that \\"deal with physical restraint, resistance and transformation as well as the contemplation of carefully selected objects and environments that trigger poetic movement.\\" Exergie ‚Äì Butter Dance Exergie ‚Äì Butter Dance is among Suryodarmo's most iconic works. She debuted the 20-minute performance in 2000 at Berlin's Hebbel Theatre. Suryodarmo enters to the sound of ceremonial Indonesian drumming that usually accompanies the Pakarena, a Bugis dance from Makassar, South Sulawesi. Wearing high-heeled shoes and a fitted black dress, she begins dancing, treading on 20 blocks of butter that have been arranged on the floor. As the tempo of the drumming increases and the butter melts, she slips and drops to the ground. After each fall, she stands up and begins to dance again, repeating the entire process. The anticipation of each inevitable fall creates a tension for the audience, generating both sympathy and fascination at her perseverance despite the apparent futility of her actions. The work sprang from an assignment by her teacher Abramoviƒá for students to create a piece using only ‚Ç¨10. Exergie ‚Äì Butter Dance has had over 20 separate performances. According to Suryodarmo, \\"the aim of making this work is to get up. You can fail, but you do it anyway. You seldom expose how to get up when you fail.\\" An edited video of Exergie ‚Äì Butter Dance was uploaded to YouTube as the \\"Adele Butter Dance\\" in 2012. In the video, Suryodarmo's 2010 performance at the Lilith Performance Studio is paired with Adele's 2011 song \\"Someone Like You\\". By 2014, the video had received over 1 million views, prompting an article about her in The New York Times. In the article, Rachel Will wrote that the video turned Suryodarmo into \\"one of the most famous performance artists to come out of Indonesia.\\" Why Let the Chicken Run? Why Let the Chicken Run? is a 15-minute performance where Suryodarmo chases a chicken. The work, first performed in 2001, is a response to Ana Mendieta's 1972 work, Death of a Chicken. The work symbolises people's \\"relentless pursuits in life.\\" Lullaby for the Ancestors In Suryodarmo's 2001 piece Lullaby for the Ancestors she repeatedly walks in a circle around a horse while cracking a whip then dunks her head in a bucket of water. The work is based on Jaran Kepang, a traditional Javanese dance where the dancers enter a trance and endure physical trials. Al√© Lino In Suryodarmo's 2003 piece Al√© Lino, she spends three hours leaning into a pole resting on her solar plexus. Inspired by her research into the Bissu, an androgynous gender of the Bugis people, Al√© Lino is an exploration of the \\"physicality of emptiness\\". The Black Ball Egon Schiele's Organic Movement of a Chair and Jug inspired Suryodarmo's The Black Ball. Suryodarmo devised the 2005 piece The Black Ball for a retrospective on painter Egon Schiele. Inspired by Schiele's 1912 drawing Organic Movement of a Chair and Jug, she held a black ball while sitting silently on a chair fixed to the museum's wall, high above the floor. During the first four days of the performance, she sat in the chair for eight- hour stretches. I Love You Suryodarmo's 2007 piece I Love You was first performed in Barcelona. For the piece, she carries a 70-pound pane of glass, and repeats the words \\"I love you\\" for four hours. She has performed I Love You in England, Sweden, and Malaysia. I Am a Ghost in My Own House In her 2012 work I Am a Ghost in My Own House, she explores consciousness related to family. In the piece, Suryodarmo silently crushes and grinds charcoal briquettes for 12 hours. The work premiered as a solo exhibition at Bandung's Lawangwangi Creative Space. By destroying a substance capable of creating energy (charcoal), Suryodarmo communicates a sense of loss. The Acts of Indecency In 2012, Suryodarmo created a photographic series influenced by Egon Schiele called The Acts of Indecency in 2012. In the work, she exposes her legs and is dressed in a tutu, wearing torn stockings stuffed with either ping pong balls or nails. Dialogue With My Sleepless Tyrant In Suryodarmo's two-hour 2013 work Dialogue With My Sleepless Tyrant, she lies down, sandwiched in the middle of tower of mattresses. Only her head is visible, sticking out from the 18-mattress stack, and her hair hangs down the side. Inspiration for the performance piece came from the fairy tale \\"The Princess and the Pea\\". Transaction of Hollows In her piece Transaction of Hollows, Suryodarmo shoots arrows at gallery walls using a Javanese bow. In one performance, she shot 800 arrows until her fingers began bleeding.

Background Upon hearing the news of Koslov's attack at Nummij√§rvi, Russian General Bibikov (positioned at √ñmossa, south of Lappfj√§rd), likewise decided to march and intercept the small Swedish force under Carl von Otter, with 2,150 men of his own, thinking his numerical superiority could easily overwhelm him. Unbeknownst to Bibikov, however, he would march against a Swedish force more than twice the size of his own, under Eberhard von Vegesack, who had landed at Kristinestad with 3,000 men, on 28 August, and taken command over von Otter's small contingent shortly after the battle at Nummij√§rvi. Swedish forces *Bj√∂rneborg Infantry Regiment (2 battalions) *H√§lsinge Infantry Regiment (3 battalions) *Uppland Infantry Regiment (2 battalions) *Gyllenb√∂gel Infantry Regiment (2 battalions) *N√§rpe and Malak Landwehr (3 companies) *A small contingent of the J√§mtland and V√§sterbotten Infantry Regiments *Life Guards of Horse (2 squadrons) *Svea and Finnish Artillery Regiments (15 guns) In total: 5,400 men and 15 guns Battle The Russian army under General Bibikov counted 2,150 men with six guns, while von Vegesack's total force numbered 5,400 men with 15 guns ‚Äî although far from all the Swedish troops would be engaged in the forthcoming battle. On 29 August the Russians launched a fruitless attack on the Swedes; attempts were made to force the Swedish flanks to give way, but in vain. After four hours of fighting the Swedish commander ordered a counterattack which forced the Russians to retreat; the battle had played out much like the fighting the day earlier, at Nummij√§rvi. The Russians retreated with a loss of 153 men killed or wounded while 82 had been captured by the Swedes; who had sustained 113 killed or wounded. The main Swedish army then fought the Battles of Ruona and Salmi, on 1‚Äì2 September 1808, which marked a turning point in the war. Aftermath Wilhelm von Schwerin at √ñmossa, by Carl Staaff At Lappfj√§rd the Swedish commander, von Vegesack, had greatly overestimated the Russian strength and thus failed to deliver a crushing defeat; a Swedish outpost was soon established at √ñmossa which consisted of one battalion from the Uppland Infantry Regiment and two guns from the Svea Artillery Regiment, led by Wilhelm von Schwerin. It was attacked by Bibikov with 1,500 men and six guns, on 6 September. The Swedes were forced back, with a loss of 64 killed or wounded, only after several Russian attacks had been repulsed (among others, by the Cossack Life Guards Regiment); mostly thanks to von Schwerin's stubborn defense at the guns, which allowed the Swedes to retreat in good order.

The Act allows the Minister of Health (or the Director-General of Health in specified circumstances) to make orders under Section 11 to give effect to the public health response to the COVID-19 in New Zealand. Legislative features The COVID-19 Public Health Response Act provides the legislative framework for the New Zealand Government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It applies all alert levels under the Government's COVID-19 Alert Level Framework, replaces the country's state of emergency orders, and empowers police and other \\"enforcement officers\\" to apply various lockdown restrictions including closing premises or roads, banning travel and public gatherings, and requiring people to self-isolate at home or with their social bubbles. The Act empowers the Minister of Health to make \\"section 11\\" orders, which are based on sections 70 and 92L of the Health Act 1956. Section 20 of the Act gives enforcement officers including the Director General of Health, medical officers, Police officers, and any person authorised by the Director General to enter any land, building, craft, vehicle, place, or thing without a warrant if they have \\"reasonable grounds\\" to believe that a person is failing to comply with any aspect of a section 11 order. Enforcement officers also have the power to shut down businesses or undertakings that are operating in violation of section 11 orders. Sections 26 and 26 also provide criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment terms not exceeding six months for those caught violating \\"section 11\\" orders. The Act also has a two-year sunset clause and will automatically be repealed unless it is continually refreshed by the New Zealand House of Representatives every 90 days. The Bill received royal assent on 13 May. Following lobbying from the MƒÅori Council, the Act was amended to remove any specific references to marae and to require that any warrantless search be reported to the relevant marae committee. History and responses On 12 May 2020, Attorney General David Parker introduced the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act to provide the legal framework for the Government's efforts to combat COVID-19 and to replace the country's state of emergency. The bill passed its first two readings on 12 May and passed its third reading on 13 May by a margin of 63 to 57 votes. The COVID-19 Public Health Response Act was supported by the Labour-led coalition government (including the allied New Zealand First and Green parties) but was opposed by the opposition National Party. National Member of Parliament Gerry Brownlee claimed that the bill placed too much power in the hands of the Prime Minister without clarifying what advice she needed to make decisions. The ACT party's sole Member of Parliament David Seymour voted in favour of the bill during its first two readings but opposed it during its third reading because he believed that it did not \\"balance the rights, freedoms and overall welfare of New Zealanders with the Government's effort to control COVID-19.\\" The COVID-19 Public Health Response Act was criticised by Chief Human Rights Commissioner Paul Hunt, who described the lack of scrutiny and rushed process as \\"a great failure of our democratic process\\". Hunt also criticised the lack of provision within the legislation to ensure that those making decisions and implementing the new law would abide by national and international human rights as well as the Treaty of Waitangi. Opposition parties and civil liberties groups also expressed concerned that the bill empowered Police to enter premises without a warrant. In response to criticism, Parker claimed that the bill limited police search powers in comparison to the Health Act 1956 and the national state of emergency. Musician and conspiracy theorist Billy Te Kahika's New Zealand Public Party has sought to repeal the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act. In late July, the Public Party entered into an alliance with independent MP Jami- Lee Ross's Advance New Zealand party.

He came to prominence after World War I as a goalscorer with Glentoran in his native Belfast, and from there moved to Scotland with Falkirk in November 1920; however, he failed to lead the attack as had been hoped, with the club bringing in Englishman Syd Puddefoot for a record fee in 1922. Gowdy is said to have then returned to Ireland without informing Falkirk, intending to play for Glentoran again while the Scottish club tried to have him return to them without success. It was agreed that he would instead play on loan with Queen's Island in Belfast. The move worked out well for player and club as Queen's Island won the double of Irish Football League and Irish Cup in the 1923‚Äì24 season. Gowdy then returned to Falkirk, initially playing alongside Puddefoot (who left during that season) but then in more defensive positions (where he had also been used in Ireland) to good effect, making close to 100 appearances across the next four seasons.

It was a branch member of the of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association from 1928 to 1974, with its jurisdiction including the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. The MAHA operated leagues for senior ice hockey which competed for the Allan Cup, and leagues for junior ice hockey which competed for the Memorial Cup. The New Brunswick Amateur Hockey Association separated from the MAHA in 1968, and the MAHA ceased to exist after the Nova Scotia Hockey Association and Prince Edward Island Hockey Association were established in 1974. History The Maritime Amateur Hockey Association (MAHA) was granted a branch membership within the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) in 1928, with its jurisdiction including the Maritimes provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. The MAHA operated leagues for senior ice hockey which competed for the Allan Cup national championship, and leagues for junior ice hockey which competed for the Memorial Cup national championship. While no junior team based in the Maritimes won the Canadian championship, the MAHA had three senior teams win the Canadian championship which included the Moncton Hawks at the 1933 Allan Cup and 1934 Allan Cup, and the Halifax Wolverines at the 1935 Allan Cup. The Maritimes saw growth in senior hockey during the Great Depression in Canada, as men sought to make a living and it was reported by The Winnipeg Tribune as common knowledge that amateurs were being paid to play in the Maritimes. In December 1934, CAHA president E. A. Gilroy asked the MAHA to make a declaration on operating a commercial league which was considered professionalism and not allowed. After a month of negotiations, the CAHA approved a senior league that excluded players suspended by the CAHA for improper transfers to the MAHA. The alt=Exterior of building Prior to the 1936 Winter Olympics, four members of the Halifax Wolverines that had been added to the Canada men's national ice hockey team were removed after reports of them demanding money. The MAHA called Gilroy's explanation unsatisfactory and threatened to resign as a branch of the CAHA. Nova Scotian lawyer Hanson Dowell served four years as president of the MAHA from 1936 to 1940, and became the first person from Atlantic Canada to be elected president of the CAHA in 1945. The CAHA proposed for the Newfoundland Amateur Hockey Association to join the MAHA in 1951, but Newfoundland declined and later became its own branch of the CAHA. New Brunswick first attempted to become a separate branch of the CAHA in 1953. A second attempt was made in 1967, and after a trial run of one year as its own association, the New Brunswick Amateur Hockey Association separated from the MAHA and became its own branch of the CAHA in 1968. The Maritime Junior A Hockey League was founded in 1968, to bring the highest level of Canadian junior hockey to the Maritimes. It operated until 1971 when junior hockey was reorganized in Canada, and the league was downgraded to Junior B status. The MAHA ceased to exist when the Nova Scotia Hockey Association was granted branch status in the CAHA in 1974, and then the Prince Edward Island Hockey Association was formed and also granted branch status in the CAHA.

The natural vegetation was mostly forest, but over the centuries human activities, including grazing and fires, replaced much of the original forest with grassland and agriculture.Fund, W. (2014). Southland temperate forests. Geography The Southland temperate forests occupy the southernmost portion of the South Island. Fiordland lies to the west. The South Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southeast. The Takitimu Mountains and Hokonui Hills form the northern edge of the ecoregion. Other highlands include the Longwood Range in the southwest, and The Catlins in the southeast. The Southland Plains cover the central-southern portion of the ecoregion. Invercargill is the largest city in the ecoregion. Most of the ecoregion lies within the Southland Region, with part of the northeast of the ecoregion being in Otago. Flora The natural vegetation was mostly forest of broadleaf trees and podocarp conifers. Higher-elevation forests are predominantly southern beech (Nothofagus), including silver beech (Nothofagus menziesii) in the western mountains and red beech (Nothofagus fusca) in the northern mountains. The lowland forests include broadleaf trees and podocarps, with kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides) common in swampy areas and rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) in drier areas. The broadleaf evergreen southern rata (Metrosideros umbellata) and kamahi (Weinmannia racemosa) are found in the central hill country and in The Catlins. Tussock grasslands occurred naturally, and expanded into large areas where the forests were burned or cleared. Red tussock grass (Chionochloa rubra) was the predominant species, with snow tussocks (primarily Chionochloa spp.) found on the higher peaks. Other habitats include dunes, coastal and riverine wetlands, and coastal tussock grasslands. Fauna Native birds include the yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes), yellowhead or m≈çhua (Mohoua ochrocephala), and New Zealand rock wren (Xenicus gilviventris). Swamp harriers (Circus approximans) and South Island fernbirds (Bowdleria punctata punctata) inhabit the tussock grasslands. Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina), New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri) and New Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri) live on the shore. History At the end of the ice age, New Zealand's glaciers retreated and the region became forested. In New Zealand birds were the largest land animals, and several species of flightless moa inhabited the ecoregion, along with Haast's eagle (Hieraaetus moorei) ,the flightless New Zealand swan (Cygnus sumnerensis) and the South Island goose (Cnemiornis calcitrans).\\"Catlins coastal area\\". New Zealand Department of Conservation - Te Papa Atawhai. Accessed 31 August 2020. The Maori settled the region after 1300. The early settlers hunted birds and seals, and the moa, New Zealand swan, and New Zealand goose were hunted to extinction. Haast's eagle relied on moas for food, and also became extinct. Hunters set fires to drive game from the forests, and frequent fires converted large areas of forest to tussock grassland. As populations of large birds and seals dwindled, fishing became an increasingly important source of food for the local Maori and they established kaika or seasonal camps, along the shoreline. European settlers arrived in the 19th century. Mixed-race whaling bases were established at Port Molyneux, Tautuku, and Waikawa, but the whales were soon over-hunted and whaling was abandoned. In the second half of the 19th century farmers and loggers settled the region, and sawmilling became an important local industry. The Southland Plains became one of New Zealand's most productive agricultural areas. Much of the remaining lowland forest was cleared, and many of the wetlands were drained or filled. Large-scale livestock grazing and introduced exotic grasses altered the ecology of the grasslands. Conservation and threats Large areas of the ecoregion have been converted to farmland or pasture. Over the past several decades a network of protected areas has been established to preserve several remaining blocks of upland forest and coastal wetland habitat. Logging, land clearance for development, and introduced exotic species remain threats to the ecoregion's biodiversity. Protected areas Satellite image of The Catlins in the eastern portion of the ecoregion. The dark-green areas are forests, mostly located on the parallel strike ridges of the Southland Syncline. A 2017 assessment found that 2,396 km¬≤, or 21%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Catlins Conservation Park (528.89 km¬≤), established in 1975, is the largest protected area in the ecoregion. Others include Takitimu Conservation Area (457.14 km¬≤) in the Takitimu Mountains, Longwood Forest Stewardship Area (229.55 km¬≤) in the Longwood Range, Hokonui Forest Stewardship Area (53.68 km¬≤) in the Hokonui Hills, and Seaward Moss Stewardship Area (56.22 km¬≤) on the southern coast.UNEP-WCMC (2020).

History and construction The bridge dates back to the 17th century, and became a listed building in 1967. Built of slate, it consists of a segmental arch and a flatter span built of slabs, and incorporates a natural boulder in midstream. The bridge is thought to have been created by miners working in the nearby Tilberthwaite Fells. Already in the 19th century, Alexander Craig Gibson called it \\"an exquisite and unique specimen of a style of bridge all but extinct\\"; a century later, Alfred Wainwright called it \\"the most picturesque footbridge in Lakeland, a slender arch constructed of slate from the quarries and built to give the quarrymen a shorter access from their homes\\". Literary associations *The bridge was acclaimed in a 20th-century poem as \\"...this/exercise in hanging circularity, toppling stress./The rough slate wedges carry their own likeness/on the belly of each, with the grass springing sidewise/at the joins. The bare arch links two valley sides/as though by a handclasp across the sky's reflection\\".Quoted in N Nichlson, The Lake District (Penguin 978) p. 58-9 See also *Ashness Bridge *Birks Bridge *Listed buildings in Coniston, Cumbria  References  External links  * Slaters Bridge Shoot Category:Bridges in Cumbria ","title":"Slater's Bridge"},{"id":"65168071","text":"Kurdyukovskoye () is a rural locality (a selo) in Chernyayevsky Selsoviet, Kizlyarsky District, Republic of Dagestan, Russia.

Chor trajeak (·ûá·ûö·ûè·üí·ûö·ûÖ·üÄ·ûÄ) is a set of traditional Khmer ear cuffs worn mostly by women. Chor trajeak was frequently seen adorned on the ears of both male and female figures on Angkorian temples. These ear ornaments are more commonly associated with the Buddhist tradition of Cambodia. Nowadays, chor trajeak is usually worn by dancers of the Royal Ballet of Cambodia and the groom in their traditional wedding costumes.  Etymology  Chor trajeak comes from two separate Khmer words; chor (·ûá·ûö) and trajeak (·ûè·üí·ûö·ûÖ·üÄ·ûÄ). Chor refers to the ornaments decorated at the edge of something while trajeak means ear. Together chor trojeak means ‚Äúthe ears ornaments,‚Äù or ear cuffs traditionally used throughout Cambodian history.  History  12th-century devatas with chor trajeak or ear cuff carved at Angkor Thom city gate. Chor trajeak has a long history in Cambodia. It's known to have existed since the Angkorian period (9th-15th century) as it is frequently seen on the ears of Angkorian deities, demon, kings and queens as well as other female figures and statues. Variety styles of chor trojeak is depicted on many figures at the Bayon temple and other temples built by King Jayavarman VII. During the reign of Jayavarman VII, Theravada Buddhism was flourishing and after the fall of Angkor, Khmer kingdoms and society were completely transformed into a Theravada Buddhist society. In Post-Angkorian periods, chor trajeak was commonly seen adorned over the ears of the Buddha statues, carvings, and mural painting. Chor trajeak is worn in various occasions. For instance, they are worn by the dancers of the Royal Ballet of Cambodia. In Cambodian wedding, Khmer grooms usually decorate their ears with chor trajeak. Chor trajeak is also found attached to Cambodian Royal Crown (Moha Mokot Reach), the royal regalia of the monarch of Cambodia.  Design  There are a variety of designs and patterns of chor trajeak. These traditional ear cuffs are carved with Khmer patterns (kbach), such as kbach Angkor, kbach kantuy hong, and kbach kanjang. Each design is unique, which can be used to distinguish and understand its context: Chor trojeak used in the Royal Ballet of Cambodia is different from the one that is worn by a Cambodian groom during the wedding ceremony.  Popularity  Chor trojeak is a symbol of beauty for Cambodian women. In a wedding ceremony, the grooms prefer wearing these ears cuffs as a symbol of beauty. In the Buddhist tradition of Cambodia, chor trajeak is considered a sacred ornament usually decorated on Buddha statues, devatas and other Buddhist deities or creatures such as kenorei, krud, etc.  See also  * Srang Kor * Sangvar * Etymology References Category: Jewellery Category:Thai_traditions ","title":"Chor trajeak"},{"id":"65168241","text":"Yasnaya Polyana () is a rural locality (a selo) and the administrative center of Yasnopolyansky Selsoviet, Kizlyarsky District, Republic of Dagestan, Russia.

Biography  Roland was born in September 1958, in the commune of Dax. Before his crimes, he was simply known as a honest, working father with two boys, employed as a foreman of a construction company.  Crimes and investigation  From 1987 to 2002, Cazaux raped at least 36 victims in Basque Country (chiefly in Arcachon and Landes). He was not considered a suspect by authorities, despite a 1982 conviction for sexual assault, for which he served a year in prison, and another for indecent assault, for which he served three months. In addition, Roland underwent medical treatment for a whole year, but psychiatric experts considered he was unlikely to reoffend. He would select potential victims during business trips. The rapist was given the nicknames \\"The Cat\\" and \\"The Spider-Man\\" because of his discretion, attacking always at night, entering through windows and avoiding detection. The examining magistrate hired a profiler, Pierre Leclair, to make a profile of their rapist and his modus operandi. Leclair noted that \\"The Cat\\" pierced holes through the shutters of victims' homes, so he could observe his victims and make sure they were alone. In 1999, a gendarme from Dax, Jean-Philippe Cheradame, made the link between the rapes that took place in Soorts-Hossegor and the ones in Arcachon, revealing that the rapist had widened his hunting grounds. The 'Rape Cell 40' unit was created, bringing together the judicial police of Bordeaux and the Research Section of Pau. The media coverage of the investigation attracted the attention of a retiree from Soorts-Hossegor, who noticed a suspicious man driving a van in his neighborhood, monitoring a nearby villa. He wrote down his license plate numbers, and not long after, the 43-year-old Roland Cazaux was arrested on February 20, 2002 at his home. During the police interrogation, he confessed to 16 successful and 20 attempted rapes, all of which played out in the same way: he would break into the home of a woman living alone at night, cut the power supply, woke her up, then tied her hands to her back with a cord. He would then assure the victim that this was a burglary, before raping her.  Trial and imprisonment  On the day of his opening trial before the assizes court of Gironde on November 28, 2005, the journalist Micha√´l Hajdenberg claimed in his article on Lib√©ration that Cazaux \\"wanted to work on himself, and showed empathy to his victims [...] [He] believed he could drown his vices in his social life; he did not succeed.\\" According to experts, he was not mentally-ill and was fully responsible for his actions. According to Dr. Jean-Pierre Bouchard, the expert psychologist who examined him, only ten months after his release, Roland's dangerous fantasies became active again. On December 16, 2005, the Assizes Court of Gironde found Cazaux guilty of 34 rapes and sentenced him to 14 years imprisonment, with a 15-year probation period. He was forbidden to make any contact with his victims, and was ordered to stay in the regions of Gironde, Landes and Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantique for 10 years. He was paroled on February 20, 2012. According to \\"L'Heure du Crime\\", on May 13, 2015, his lawyer indicated that he currently lives according to the demands of the court, and regularly has psychiatric check-ups.

He attended primary and secondary school in Antakya and studied Theater at the Yeditepe University in Istanbul, from where he graduated in 2009.  Professional career  He played in several Turkish TV series and movies and together with friends he established the Emek Sahnesi Theater in 2011. He is an outspoken critic of Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan's policies and the application of the rule of law in Turkey. He acted in the theater play \\"Only a Dictator\\" (), which was widely viewed as a parody of Erdoƒüan. The play was subsequently prohibited to be performed in the Kadik√∂y district where the Emek Sahnesi Theater is located. As a reaction to this ban, he published the piece in the internet and the play was then shown in the Maxim Gorki Theater in Berlin.  Political career  He was a strong supporter of the Gezi Park protests and as such was criticized by Melih G√∂k√ßek from the governing party, the Justice and Development Party (AKP. In November 2013, he was briefly detained due to suspected links to RedHack, a Turkish hacker group supportive of the Gezi Park protests, but released after a week. In May 2018, he was announced as a candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (HDP) for the parliamentary elections in 2018 in which he was elected as a representative of the Hatay province. In 2018, he and Erkan Ba≈ü announced their resignation from the HDP and together joined the Workers' Party of Turkey (Tƒ∞P), becoming their only representatives in the Parliament.  Controversies  In June 2020, he claimed a car of the TIP he was using was sabotaged by his political opponents in order to cause an accident. After he demanded clarification in a case in which a sergeant admitted to rape of a Kurdish woman but was not arrested, he drew harsh criticism on him by the Turkish Minister of the Interior S√ºleyman S√∂ylu, who blamed him of being a sympathizer of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP-C) and advised him \\"don't get caught\\". The following night, he claimed that he was attacked by five individuals, causing him to stay the night in the hospital. For the assault, he blamed S√∂ylu.

He is the founder and CEO of Wasatch Group, a real estate investment firm, and is the owner of Real Salt Lake of Major League Soccer and other associated soccer teams. Career Hansen was born in Salina, Utah, and raised in southern Utah by his father, working for the Soil Conservation Service, and his mother, a schoolteacher. He graduated from the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University in 1982 with a Bachelor of Science in political science. Hansen started a home-building business that closed during a savings and loan crisis in 1988. Hansen founded the Wasatch Group later that year, taking over government-seized real estate from the Resolution Trust Corporation for resale. The company later expanded into commercial office development and management, including the ownership of high-rise buildings in the Salt Lake City area. , the Wasatch Group manages 65 properties in the Western United States, worth an estimated $1.3 billion, and employs 500 people. Hansen also owns Broadway Media, which manages several radio stations in Utah. Sports ownership Hansen bought a minority stake in the ownership of Major League Soccer franchise Real Salt Lake in 2009 from Dave Checketts. His involvement with the club began with a political fundraiser at Rio Tinto Stadium during a U.S. men's national team match, his second time watching live soccer, where Checketts had pitched the stake to former Disney CEO Michael Eisner before Hansen negotiated his share. Hansen's stake, originally 49 percent of the club, was increased to 62 percent in late 2012. Checketts sold his majority stake in the team to Hansen in 2013, giving him full control of the club, Rio Tinto Stadium, and sports radio station KALL. Under Hansen's ownership through Utah Soccer LLC, Real Salt Lake launched a reserve team, Real Monarchs, that began play in 2015. The team was moved to a new venue, Zions Bank Stadium, on the grounds of a soccer academy in Herriman, Utah, that was partially funded by Hansen and opened in 2018. Hansen also negotiated a tax break with the Sandy city government for Rio Tinto Stadium, which was protested by city leaders in 2017. RSL also launched a women's team, Utah Royals FC of the National Women's Soccer League, that began play in 2018. Hansen had approached Merritt Paulson of the Portland Timbers and Portland Thorns about a franchise in the women's league four years earlier and bought the rights to defunct franchise FC Kansas City. Controversy and end of ownership Following a player strike that caused the postponement of MLS matches on August 27, 2020, Hansen expressed his disappointment in an interview with radio station KXRK, also threatening to cease funding the club due to players not playing to show support for Black Lives Matter and to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake. The comments were criticized by prominent MLS and NBA players, which caused him to later retract his comments in an interview with ESPN700 and issue an apology. An article published later that day in The Athletic reported a history of alleged racist comments made by Hansen about or in the presence of Black employees at the Wasatch Group and in the RSL organization. Further allegations were also published in The Salt Lake Tribune, including Hansen's mimicking of Black employee's accents, triggering investigations from MLS and NWSL. On August 30, 2020, MLS and NWSL announced that Hansen would explore selling Real Salt Lake, Real Monarchs, and the Utah Royals. Personal life Hansen and his first wife Karla Axtell had eight children. His daughter Robin played college soccer for the Utah State Aggies in 2012. He was later married in 1997 to Lynnette Hansen, a business executive and philanthropist. Hansen is currently married to Julie Aiken Hansen. Hansen is also an avid coin collector and acquired a rare 1894-S Barber dime for $1.3 million in 2019.

Early life Karim was born in Batusangkar, today in the Tanah Datar Regency of West Sumatra, on 22 October 1910. He underwent education in Bukittinggi, completing elementary education in 1924, MULO in 1927, and a \\"nobility school\\" (MOSVIA) training local nobility to be civil servants in 1931. Career After completing school, Karim was assigned by the colonial government to Pontianak, where he worked for eight years before he returned to West Sumatra to be assigned in Solok. After the Japanese invasion, Karim went into hiding for some time as the Japanese sought to capture former colonial officials, before a lack of administrative personnel prompted the Japanese to offer Karim his civil servant work back. He was assigned to Bukittinggi in 1943, working there a year before being reassigned to Air Bangis, West Pasaman Regency. He returned to Bukittinggi in mid-1945. Following Indonesian independence, Karim began to work under the Indonesian government. He was briefly detained by Masyumi rebels during the 3 March affair, though the rebellion was short-lived and Karim was soon after freed. He served as the secretary to the Republican military governor of Central Sumatra, , between Operation Kraai and the end of the revolution. He also headed the residency of West Sumatra, under the military governor. For a time, he also taught as a lecturer in a civil servant academy which was established in Bukittinggi. During the post-revolutionary period, Karim was appointed as Minister of Agriculture, representing the Indonesian National Party, for the Second Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet. He was dispatched to lead the Indonesian delegation to the FAO. In a period of high tensions in West Sumatra, in January 1957 Karim was sent to lead a delegation from the national government to the \\"Banteng Council\\". While Karim and his entourage was accepted, the council refused to negotiate with the group. Karim's later press statement in Jakarta received a counterreaction from the council, as Karim claimed that he had negotiated a form of settlement and gave some money to the council. Karim was in Bukittinggi to continue negotiations in February 1958 when the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI) was declared, and he was detained by PRRI. Karim joined the Ministry of Home Affairs after his ministerial career, becoming the director for general governance in 1959, and later the ministry's secretary-general by 1962. He was appointed acting governor of North Sumatra on 8 April 1963, replacing Raja Junjungan Lubis who was facing significant opposition from the Indonesian Communist Party. He held this post until a new governor was elected and sworn in by the provincial legislature on 15 July 1963. He was retired as a civil servant in 1967. He died on 5 September 1995 in Jakarta, and was buried at the Karet Cemetery.

He is best known for historical scenes and social realist depictions of the lives of working people. One of his favorite places to find subjects for those works was in the Basque country of Biscay.  Biography  At the Feet of the Savior He was the only child of , a noted botanist. Throughout most of his childhood, he suffered from a nervous disorder that affected his eyesight. He originally studied architecture, but quit to study painting at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando.Biography and works @ the Museo del Prado. There, he was influenced by the works of Eduardo Rosales. When he first arrived in Toledo, he received a number of commissions for religious paintings. In 1884, he became a Professor of Drawing at the Sociedad Cooperativa de Obreros de Toledo (Co-operative Workers' Society) and was able to marry his childhood sweetheart, Luisa Salazar. Through his long-standing friendship with the painter, Ricardo Arredondo Calmache, he was led to abandon his preference for works in the style of Rosales and turned to social realism. This tendency was heightened by a stay in Italy, at the Regio Instituto delle Belle Arte de Roma, supported by a hard-won scholarship. It was fully confirmed when Rerum novarum, a Papal encyclical on the condition of the working classes, was issued in 1891. At the National Exhibition of Fine Arts in 1887, he had been awarded a Third Class prize for his painting, \\"At the Feet of the Savior\\". Five years later, he was honored with a First Class prize for \\"A Workers' Strike in Vizcaya\\", his first major work in social realist style. In 1900, he was named a Professor of Drawing at the Instituto General y T√©cnico de Segovia. From 1903 to 1904, he was Director of the Escuela de Artes y Oficios de Logro√±o (School of Arts and Crafts). When he returned to Toledo, he became the Professor of \\"Special studies of drawing and decorative composition\\" at the Escuela Superior de Artes Industriales.

He joined the coaching staff at Northern Arizona in 2006 as a receivers coach, working his way up to offensive coordinator in 2009. He left Northern Arizona to accept the offensive coordinator position at San Jose State in 2012. He was a finalist for the head coaching job at his alma mater Idaho in 2012, but the job ultimately went to Paul Petrino.  Colorado  After San Jose State head coach Mike MacIntyre was named the new head coach at Colorado, Lindgren joined him as his offensive coordinator, the same position he held under him at San Jose State. He was shifted to co- offensive coordinator in 2016 following the hire of Darrin Chiaverini, sharing coordinator duties with Chiaverini.  Oregon State  Lindgren was hired to be the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Oregon State in 2018. It was reported in December 2019 that Lindgren was offered the offensive coordinator position at Arizona State, but he turned down the offer.

Fatima had initially refused to contest but was persuaded by Siddaramaiah, Mallikarjun Kharge & G.Parameshwar. Besides people of all communities convinced her contest. More than sympathy, the election campaign was done by highlighting the contributions of her husband Qamar-ul-Islam and won election against Nasir Hussain Ustad of JD(s) and Chandrakanth Patil of BJP by 5,940 votes.  CAA Protest  A massive protest, the largest in North Karnataka, took place in the town of Kalaburagi against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Around 15,000 people gathered for protest march and came out defying Section 144 notification that was imposed on the entire state of Karnataka. MLA Kaneez Fathima was the major catalyst in mobilising citizens. All local Congress Corporators reportedly came out in support of the protest.  Controversy  Kaneez Fatima had purchased 22 acres of agriculture land near Gulbarga. S K Kantha, former minister, had filed a complaint alleging that the purchase was illegal and violated Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961. The Act prohibits purchase of agricultural land by any person other than an agriculturist. The Gulbarga tahsildar, in his report to the Assistant Commissioner, stated that Qamarul Islam runs schools and owns commercial complexes and hence the income of Fatima exceeded Rs two lakh per annum. The Assistant Commissioner set aside the purchase of land by Fatima with an observation that the purchaser had violated the provisions of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act. He has directed the tahsildar to take over the land and mention Karnataka Government as the owner of the land.

Workcamps are considered one of the most important types of international volunteering programs. They were first introduced in 1920 as a way of bringing people together for increased international understanding and peace reconciliation efforts.  Concept  Workcamp volunteering commonly involves teams of 10‚Äì16 young people from multiple countries that live and work together while completing some form of work project. Usually younger people from the ages of 18 on are the main participant group, but some organizations also havecamps for teenagers from the age of 15 or specifically for older people. Workcamps typically do not require any special skills or qualifications for volunteers to participate. International volunteers are supposed to support local communities with their work. There are different types of work depending on the task to carry on, e.g. archaeology, restoration of monuments, environmental protection, community work. While the work itself is an important part of the concept, they also usually to strengthen intercultural understanding, democractic awareness, to increase independence and self-reliance of participants and to increase their understanding of history and politics, with most organisations offering workcamps focusing on the aspect of intercultural understanding. Workcamps are supposed to reduce conflicts and prejudice between people from different national and social backgrounds. Prices oscillate depending on sending organisation, hosting country, modality and length of the stay. Participants usually must pay for their travel tickets, whereas the hosting organisation would pay for accommodation and meals.  History  From 20 November 1920 to 21 April 1921, the first workcamp of Service Civil International took place in Northern France in order to reconstruct the village Esnes-en-Argonne, damaged in the Battle of Verdun in World War I. Behind this initiative was Swiss pacifist Pierre C√©r√©sole, who came up with the idea at a peace conference in 1920 that was part of the Bilthoven Meetings. He saw this form of volunteering as a way to overcome nationalism and militarism. The English Quaker Hubert Parris, who had experience in organizing relief work, supported Ceresole in preparing the project. Pierre C√©r√©sole (on the left) in the first workcamp in France in 1920In the middle of November of 1920, Ceresole and Parris started building a shelter for the volunteers who would be arriving in December, among them several German volunteers who had been soldiers during World War I. During the winter months, the volunteers built several huts for the village. Already in January the working conditions deteriorated and the work of the volunteers became more demanding. The French government reduced the funds for the building materials and in March the prefect of Meuse forbade the mayor of Esnes from allocating work to the volunteers. The difficult political circumstances of that time when the negotiations concerning the German war reparations had just failed, were behind the prefect‚Äôs decision. After this, the volunteers continued to help the farmers in the village and a neighbouring village put forward a new agricultural reconstruction project. Eventually, the local authorities demanded that the German volunteers would have to leave the area. The team finished its work in April 1921 and left Esnes-en-Argonne. Workcamps from the 1920s onwards became a way of responding to global and local humanitarian and crisis situations. The biggest project took place, again organised by C√©r√©sole and Service Civil International, in 1928 in Liechtenstein, where 720 volunteers from over 20 countries helped to reconstruct the country after a flood event. The experience in Liechtenstein and the enthusiasm of the volunteers became a model for future work camps, which from 1930 onwards were carried out in France, Great Britain and other countries. Until the 1950s, the concept of workcamps was mainly spread within Europe and many projects were focused on the reconstruction of the continent after World War II. Service Civil International started branches in several countries, but also organisations like the Christian Movement for Peace (CMP) started adopting the concept of workcamps for example for post-war reconciliation between French and German Christians. Since the 1950s, workcamps have increasingly been organised also in Asia, Africa and Latin America, with a rise in projects especially since the 1990s. In 1948, organisations from Western and Eastern Europe as well as the USA started the Coordinating Committee for International Work-Camps (CoCo), since 1965 Coordinating Committee for International Voluntary Service (CCIVS), at a workcamp conference organised at the UNESCO Headquarters in Paris. The organisation since then focuses on creating a stronger network between its member organisations and to have a stronger representation in international institutions.

First construction on its site began in 1239. The building went through renovations and expansions during different periods in history; it consists of Renaissance, Neoclassical, Valencian Gothic and Baroque styles. It was classified as a Bien de Inter√©s Cultural in 1931. Originally built as a church, it is now used as a Spanish Army headquarters. History and architecture The church was founded in 1239 on land granted by King James I of Aragon. It was replaced by a larger construction in 1250 because of concerns regarding the durability of the original building. Its Gothic cloister, the oldest architectural remains of the church, was built around 1300. It was renovated according to the Occitan Gothic model with a floor plan consisting of a single nave and side chapels in 1382; the remnant of this church that survive is in the form of a spacious temple, the Chapel of Saint Vincent Ferrer built in neoclassical style. It was renovated and extended in the latter half of the 18th century. King Alfonso V of Aragon ordered the construction of the Chapel of the Kings in 1431, and it was completed in 1463 by King John II of Aragon. The structure remains intact and consists of three sections: the first two oblong, and the one that leads to the presbytery hexagonal. Although the chapel has a rectangular plan, two horns at each angle on the front wall allow a spatial transition. The Chapel of the Kings is connected to the Chapel of Saint Vincent Ferrer. It also has its own access through the Renaissance cloister; this entrance consists of a pointed portico with a double archivolt on paired columns with a tympanum of the arms of Alfonso V of Aragon. Highlights of this room are its fa√ßade which was built in Gothic and Renaissance style, the vaulted roof without ribs and a double helical staircase lacking a stone axis.B√©rchez, J., Arquitectura renaixentista valenciana (1500-1570). Val√®ncia, Bancaixa, 1994, p. 51. The staircase communicates with the terrace; it was built in a way to allow two people to go up and down simultaneously without inconveniencing each other. Once the essential parts of the convent were completed, the construction of the entrance patio to the temple and the respective exterior facade were begun. This consisted of an imafronte in the form of an altarpiece divided into two bodies.L√≥pez Torrijos, R. \\"Los autores del sepulcro de los marqueses de Zenete\\", Archivo Espa√±ol de Arte, n√∫m. 203 Juliol-Setembre, p√†gs. 323-336 The Chapter Hall in the eastern gallery is a vaulted room that began construction in the 14th century. It constitutes a square room of twelve meters per side whose rib vault rests on four central columns; fasciculated bundles of these columns are effectively prolonged in the shape of a palm tree in the nervices of the vault, producing an effect of weightlessness and lightness of the room. This room is accessed through a pointed arch decorated with openwork tracery similar to that of the large windows, divided by stylized maineles. The Refectory or Throne Room used as a reception room, began to be built in 1560 and belongs to the Baroque style.B√©rchez, J., Arquitectura renaixentista valenciana (1500-1570). Val√®ncia, Bancaixa, 1994, p. 90.

After weeks of unequal clashes, the rebels were defeated/ During supression of the uprising, the Bolsheviks burned many villages and killed 400-500 peasants.  About = Outbreak of the uprising  On August 23, 1920 residents of the village of Kuzun (K√ºz√ºn) in the Guba district staged an armed uprising. By killing 2 policemen, they declared their disobedience to the new Soviet government. To prevent this uprising, the district committee sent a detachment of 45 armed forces (30 cavalry, 15 infantry) from the 4th Cavalry Regiment to the Kuzun village. However, the detachment was unable to quell the revolt and suffered heavy losses. Only six people survived the detachment. The military commissar of Guba sent troops including a machine gunner to restore Soviet power in the village of Kuzun. On August 26, a new battle broke out between the rebels in the village of Kuzun and Soviet forces. The villagers again resisted the Soviet forces. On August 29, 1920, a new battle took place between Soviet forces and the rebels at four versts of Guba. Soviet troops of a hundred men suffered heavy casualties. National Archives of the Republic of Azerbaijan file 2475, list 1, case 39, sheet.4 By the end of August and the beginning of September, an armed rebel group had already been formed. There were also Turkish officers in the group led by Lieutenant Colonel Afandiyev of the Republican Army. The rebels seized a large number of machine guns and five-barreled rifles. At 7 am on September 3, 1920 the rebels attacked Davachi-Khachmaz region. There they clashed with the seventh cavalry detachment. After a fierce battle, Soviet-Bolshevik fighters were able to maintain their positions. However, four of them were killed and four Lewis machine guns were seized. An armored train of the Bolsheviks was placed near Khachmaz which was increasing their chances to attack. However, the rebels were in positions that could not be reached by artillery fire of the train. According to the intelligence, the locals who were also against the new regime formed an armed group in Charkhi station.National Archives of the Republic of Azerbaijan file 2475, list 1, case 39, sheet.2 One of the strongest groups in Guba was led by Hamdulla Afandi Afandizadeh, a former member of the Parliament of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.Sattar Afandiyev, a national army officer Shukur Bey, a Turkish officer Ismail Ali Afandi and Shamsaddin Afandi, brother of Hamdulla Afandi Afandizadeh, also led the uprising.  Supression of the uprising  These uprising, which were dangerous for the Soviet regime, were seriously discussed at the plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan on September 9, 1920. The plenum decided to send Aliheydar Garayev and Levan Gogoberidze to quell the Guba uprising, and to appoint Gazanfar Musabayov as the emergency commissioner of the Guba district. On September 11, 1920, the emergency commissioner of the district, Gazanfar Musabayov, appealed to the people of Guba. The appeal provided information about the uprising that took place in the district under the leadership of Hamdulla Efendi and Kachak Mail, as well as its suppression. To prevent the uprising from escalating, Musabayov announced an amnesty on behalf of the Soviet government to the rebels and called on the militants to surrender their weapons. He also announced that any new attempts to revolt against the Soviet government would be ruthlessly suppressed.National Archives of the Republic of Azerbaijan file 2475, list 1, case 39, sheet.2 Representatives of the Soviet government in Guba and the 11th Army also appealed to the people of Guba to collect weapons and prevent new uprisings. The appeal also called on the population not to believe the propaganda against the Bolshevik forces, not to join the local Beys and Khans who took a stance against the Soviet government, and to hand over their weapons to the authorities. The Guba uprising, in which 5,000 to 6,000 people took part, was brutally suppressed in September. 400 - 500 villagers were killed in operations led by Aliheydar Garayev and Levan Gogoberidze, who were sent to the region to quell the uprising.

Garrotting was a term used for robberies in which the victim was strangled to incapacitate them but came to be used as a catch-all term for what is described today as a mugging. An 1880 newspaper depiction of a garrotte robbery Despite a general fall in crime following the 1829 establishment of the Metropolitan Police, the press reported in 1856 that garrotting was on the rise. They laid the blame at the recent cessation of transportation to Australia as a punishment for offenders and the subsequent adoption of the ticket of leave system of release on licence. The reported rise in street robbery is considered to have largely been an invention of the press; fears subsided when press coverage petered out at the end of the year. The panic led to the Penal Servitude Act 1857, which increased the minimal prison sentence for offences previously punished by transportation. The July 1862 garrotting of Member of Parliament James Pilkington, widely covered in the press, led to a renewed panic. Again the penal system was criticised for its supposed softness and the police for their inefficiency. The panic saw some Londoners wearing anti-garrotting clothing such as studded leather collars and cravats with razor blades sewn in, a move which was parodied by Punch. The panic led to new legislation on prison conditions, which were made substantially more harsh. Prison sentences lengthened and flogging returned for violent street robberies. These measures affected criminals throughout the late Victorian era and reversed previous measures to move the prison system from punishment towards rehabilitation. The panic petered out by the start of 1863 with reduced press coverage as other stories took over the headlines.  Background  A Metropolitan Police constable in the 1850s, showing high anti- strangulation collar Garrotting is a term for strangulation that came into English from the garrotte, an execution device commonly used in Spain and its former colonies. The term came into common use in Britain after widespread coverage of the execution of General Narciso L√≥pez in Havana in September 1851. It came to refer to a particular type of street robbery in which the victim was strangled with a cord or by the attacker's arm to incapacitate them, often whilst an accomplice relieved them of their valuables. Contemporary reports claimed that the technique was learnt by convicts on prison hulks where it was used by jailers to subdue troublesome convicts. The Metropolitan Police had, since their founding, worn high leather collars as a protection against strangulation. The term later developed into a wider use to cover all forms of street robbery in which violence was used. This was a similar use to the modern term mugging and prior to the 1850s, the Indian term thugee had carried a similar meaning. The phrase \\"putting the hug on\\" was also used in the mid-Victorian era.  1856  Although difficult to measure at a time when most crime went unrecorded it is thought that crime in London had generally been reducing since the 1829 establishment of the Metropolitan Police. Despite this, in 1856 the British public regarded the streets of London as dangerous. A November speech by the Prime Minister Lord Palmerston announcing that Britons would feel safe to travel the world led to an editorial in the Times that stated \\"it is of far more moment to a Londoner that he should be able at all hours of the day or night to walk safely in the streets of London\\". The editor claimed that areas of the city were no-go areas for respectable people who were at \\"imminent danger of being throttled, robbed, and if not actually murdered, at least kicked and pommelled within an inch of his life\\". Subsequent reports in the press claimed that garrotting was on the rise and led to a panic among the middle classes. An 1862 Punch cartoon satirising the ticket of leave scheme. A convict is released by a friendly jailer upon having attained a suitable weight. The press reports laid the blame at a supposedly \\"soft\\" penal system and for the increasing numbers of prisoners released on parole under the ticket of leave scheme. This scheme had been introduced by the Penal Servitude Act 1853 to relieve prison overcrowding. This had been caused by the cessation, in most cases, of transportation to Australia as a punishment and its replacement with penal servitude (imprisonment with hard labour), of a minimum sentence of three years. The ticket of leave scheme was one of the first uses of release on licence for prisoners in the United Kingdom. Newspapers reported that violent crime, previously considered a problem only in working class areas of the city, was spreading to middle class neighbourhoods. There was frequent correspondence in the Times, which carried seven editorials on garrotting during the panic, with one writer claiming that garrotters \\"no longer confine their operations to by-lanes but attack us in the most frequented thoroughfares of the metropolis\\". The criminals, sometimes called \\"street Bedouins\\", were characterised as \\"work-shy savages with a propensity for gratuitous violence\\". The increased publicity for garrotting crimes led to judges and magistrates imposing harsher sentences on those convicted for violent robbery offences. The moral panic is considered to have originated in the press coverage and subsided when coverage was curtailed. The newspapers considered that the story would not remain newsworthy into 1857 and so seem to have made use of some minor changes to legislation to declare the end of the crisis. A House of Commons select committee met to consider alternatives to the ticket of leave system, its report lamented the end of transportation but was largely positive about the system. Its recommendations on minor adjustments to the ticket of leave system were confirmed by the Penal Servitude Act 1857, which was accompanied by guidance from the Home Secretary, Sir George Grey on how the system should work. Under the Penal Servitude Act 1857 criminals would continue to be released on a ticket of leave by prisons at the earliest opportunity though the minimum sentence for offences previously punished by transportation was increased from four years to seven. There remained a lack of police resources to adequately monitor those released on licence, which some reporters suggested would lead to future issues. Following the panic the public fear of garrotting subsided in the later 1850s. In 1859 the Metropolitan Police reduced the height of their anti-garrotting stocks to .  1862‚Äì63  Anti-garrotte attire lampooned in Punch 1862 Anti- garrotte collar lampooned in Punch 1862 A second moral panic occurred in 1862 after the robbery of the member of parliament for Blackburn, James Pilkington. Pilkington was garrotted at 1am on 17 July in Pall Mall, returning from a late night sitting of the House of Commons. Pilkington was assaulted by two attackers who stole his pocket watch. The attack was widely publicised in the press and served as the inspiration for an attack on a cabinet minister in Anthony Trollope's Phineas Finn. Crime had continued to fall through the 1850s, though the police figures for Middlesex (which included much of London north of the Thames) show a slight increase in robberies in the early part of 1862. Despite this there was widespread coverage in the newspapers with almost every fresh street robbery being seized upon as evidence of another garrotting crime wave. The Times once more led the coverage but reports were also made in the Sun, Observer, Punch and the Saturday Review. The Daily News described London as \\"a lair of footpads and assassins by night\\" while the Quarterly Review claimed that \\"the streets of the metropolis are not safe even in the daytime\\". The press claimed again that the treatment of criminals in prison was not a deterrent and Sir Joshua Jebb, director of convict prisons, came in for particular criticism. Police figures for the last quarter of the year show a significant increase in street robbery, though crime in general was falling. The increase might be attributed to greater reporting of robbery following the publicity of the Pilkington case or to the concentration of police resources in this area as a result of the panic. The Middlesex quarter sessions saw an unprecedented 27 garrotters tried, which Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Richard Mayne claimed were almost all of the violent street robbers in London. Sentences passed in this period tended to be heavier than normal, which was attributed to the panic. During this period, in November and December, the Times continued to focus on the panic printing 18 editorials calling for the return of transportation. It continued to blame the legal system, claiming that \\"the whole of this great and most expensive judicial hierarchy seems to be established solely to catch thieves and let them go again\\"; the home secretary (Grey) and prison chaplains were singled out for particular criticism. The newspaper printed correspondence from readers recommending the establishment of new penal colonies in Labrador, the Falkland Islands, Queensland and the Cameroon mountains. Newspaper coverage of the panic declined significantly in December as it was displaced by other stories, including the replacement of Otto of Greece, the capture of Giuseppe Garibaldi in Italy, the Lancashire Cotton Famine and developments in the ongoing American Civil War. The Times reflected on the panic in June 1863 and considered that the crisis had ended due to greater publicity and the refocusing of police resources. The event is now viewed a classic example of a moral panic, a period of intense media coverage with little basis in fact. The Shoreditch Advertiser investigated cases in its district and found not one verifiable case of garrotting among numerous reports, with them all found to be \\"utterly fictitious or mere drunken squabbles\\". The panic was largely confined to London, despite the fact that it had lower levels of street robbery than other parts of the country, such as the north west. The panic led to shifts in the behaviour of Londoners. There were cases of citizens attacking one another in the mistaken belief that they were preventing a garrotting. Some Londoners took measures towards self-defence including the purchase of personal weapons and the adoption of bizarre anti-garrotting devices such as spiked collars and cravats with razor blades sewn into them. These were lampooned by cartoons in Punch which included clothing with oversized spikes and overcoats with umbrella-like tails to prevent garrotters approaching the wearer.  New legislation  The 1862 panic led to significant changes in legislation. Under pressure from the press Grey set up the Royal Commission on Penal Servitude and Transportation in December 1862 to review the prison situation and determine if transportation should be reintroduced. The commission reported in June 1863 and its recommendations were implemented via the Penal Servitude Act 1864. Transportation remained largely unavailable but three and four year penal servitude sentences were abolished and replaced by five year minimum sentences. The act also compelled the police to monitor prisoners released on licence. Treadmill at Coldbath Fields Prison, 1864 A House of Lords select committee on prison discipline was set up and reported in July 1863. It recommended harsher prison conditions, the so-called \\"hard fare, hard bed and hard work\\" regime, be implemented as a deterrent to criminals. Under the subsequent Prisons Act of 1865, prisoners were to be prevented from communicating with one another, to be chained and bound more often, to be provided hard planks to sleep on, and given deliberately plain food. Hard labour was defined as time spent on the penal treadmill, crank machine, capstan or on shot drill (passing cannonballs along a line); deliberately monotonous and pointless work. This returned prison life to the harsh standards of the early 19th century, undoing decades of reform which had sought to transfer the prison from a place of punishment to a place of rehabilitation. The harsh measures remained in force until the Prisons Act 1898 which implemented reforms. The moral panic of 1862‚Äì63 therefore caused harsh prison conditions to be inflicted upon hundreds of thousands of prisoners for decades. The Security from Violence Act was also passed in July 1863 and specifically targeted street robbery, becoming known informally as the Garrotters Act. This undid reforms passed by a select committee of 1861 which abolished flogging for most offences and implemented bans on repeated flogging (of 50 lashes a time) for a single offence. Under the Security from Violence Act garrotters faced being flogged three times for each offence. This act, which remained on the statute books until the Criminal Justice Act 1948, was described by Grey as \\"panic legislation [passed] after the panic had subsided\\".  Legacy  Social historian Rob Sindall describes the garrotting panics as perhaps the first moral panics in Britain. Turner et al writing in 2017 consider that the panics had little founding in reality and were largely manufactured by the press. They consider that the increase in violent street robberies observed in the crime statistics is because the police responded by focusing their resources into this area. This increase in recorded crime, as reported in the press, may have led to increase fears. Sindall considers that the criticism of the police for failing to prevent street robbery is not justified. The panics led, by pressure on politicians from the middle classes, to Parliament passing poorly thought-out legislation that was reactionary and ineffective. Outbreaks of garrotting occurred in Liverpool in the 1880s and 1890s and 72 people were flogged for the offence, though with little apparent deterrent effect. The move towards self-defence measures marks the last major attempt by the citizenry to take the lead in self-protection, reversing the general trend at the time to allow the police to adopt this role.

John Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley, the later inheritor of the estate, built the hall on a site north- west of the remains of the priory. The ruins, which had been occupied by businesses, were cleared of industrial debris and made into a picturesque feature; a driveway was created through the ruins.

It is situated to the east of the River Ardle, a mile east of Enochdhu. In 1554 the Earl of Atholl granted a charter of the lands of Invercrosky and Whitefield to Baron Ruadh, who built a house on the land which he named Balvarran, meaning Township of the Baron. The existing house, which is category B listed, dates back to the 17th century and was completed in 1641. Just three years later, in 1664, it was burnt to the ground by the James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. In more recent times cannon balls fired by Montrose's men have been found in the immediate proximity of the house. It was soon rebuilt and later underwent further additions, including a porch, entrance hall, billiards room, kennels and stables designed by Sir Robert Lorimer in 1895. The entrance hall and billiard room include fine plasterwork ceilings. There are three marriage lintels at the property although it is believed all of the dates relate to completion of building works as opposed to the date of marital union. The earliest of these lintels bears the date 1641. Though the exact circumstances are unclear the Duke of Atholl granted the property to James Stormonth of Lednathie in 1791. Moir Tod Stormonth Darling, Lord Stormonth Darling lived at Balvarran between 1894 and 1912. Balvarran remains the home of the Stormonth Darling family.  Myth, legend and folklore = The Balvarran Cupped Stone  The Balvarran Cupped Stone is located north-north-east of the house. This archaeological feature is a mass of micaceous schist featuring four large cups in the surface. It is suggested the cups may have been \\"cressets to light monks to their devotions\\" or that it might have been used as a christening stone by the Barons Ruadh, but there is no definite nor agreed original use for the stone. = Cam Ruadh = Cattle thieves were a persistent problem in the area during the 17th century. To remedy the situation Alexander Ruadh, the 6th Baron Ruadh, engaged the services of his cousin, Cam Ruadh - a respected archer despite having just one eye. Together they schemed to make a white cow lame so that when the cattle were driven away at night the white cow would be visible at the back of the herd. Whenever one of the thieves hit the white cow with a stick to drive it on, Cam Ruadh shot an arrow just a yard behind it and in so doing killed the drover. Once several of the raiders had been killed or injured the rest of them fled leaving the cattle behind. Cam Ruadh had predicted their escape route and hid towards the bottom of the Altchroskie burn, a little above Altchroskie House to the west of Balvarran. Here he killed several more raiders making their escape. It is said that the burn was so reddened with blood that even the stones were stained. There have been many reported sightings of the ghosts of these caterans along the burn. = The Bhantighearna Mharranach = The 7th baron‚Äôs wife, Magdalene, was well known locally as a ‚Äòdreamer of dreams‚Äô and prophetess. Many tales of the ‚ÄòBhantighearna Mharranach‚Äô, (the derivation from gaelic is the Mar Lady) as she was known, remained in local folklore for generations. One such vision occurred on 26 July 1689, when she dreamed she was standing in front of the house at Balvarran and saw a dragon spitting balls of fire flying towards her from the west. However the dragon could do her no harm as it was tethered to a chain at its foot. Though this vision did not transpire literally it‚Äôs thought to signify a feared army of men led by John Graham, Viscount Dundee, who had threatened to execute the likes of Baron Ruadh unless he offered up arms for the Jacobite cause. The following day Viscount Dundee was killed at the Battle of Killiecrankie.

As a teenager, he studied Islam in Mecca, during which he became familiar with the Sarekat Islam (SI) and its leaders in Indonesia. By the age of 18, he had returned to Indonesia, to his home in Tasikmalaya, and joined the SI. Career Once he returned, Djoenaidi worked to manage his father's coconut plantation, and traded in textiles around West Java. He expanded the agricultural business to lemongrass and rubber, and became known with the moniker \\"Lemongrass King\\". He also started a publisher, Galunggung, in Bandung. In 1933, during a business trip to Batavia, he met journalist Saeroen who stayed in a hostel run by Djoenaidi's son, and he agreed to invest in Saeroen's newspaper Pemandangan. Within Pemandangan, Djoenaidi invested a significant proportion of his personal wealth, appointed Mohammad Tabrani as chief editor when Saeroen left, and was noted to be generous in compensation to writers and employees. In 1940 Djoenaidi additionally raised funds through Pemandangan to repatriate Indonesians living in Mecca stranded by transport restrictions due to World War II. During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, Djoenaidi was made deputy chief editor of the Japan-backed Asia Raya newspaper. Following Indonesian independence, Djoenaidi along with others such as Adam Malik and Sumanang co-founded the National Press Company (Badan Usaha Penerbitan Nasional), and he became a member of its board of directors. Djoenaidi had significant connections with republican leaders during the Indonesian National Revolution, at one point being arrested by the Dutch due to \\"connection with terrorist activities\\".

He is University Professor for the Philosophy of Religion and Philosophy of Science at the Catholic Theological Faculty of the Ruhr University Bochum and an associate member of the Faculty of Theology and Religion at the University of Oxford. His research includes theoretical, practical and historical philosophy and can be divided into three main areas: philosophy of science and metaphysics, transhumanism and ethics of digitization, and German Idealism, in particular the philosophy of Karl Christian Friedrich Krause (1781‚Äì1832).  Biography  After studying philosophy, Catholic theology and religious studies at the University of M√ºnster, G√∂cke received his doctorate in 2011 under Klaus M√ºller with a thesis on the panentheism of Karl Christian Friedrich Krause at the Catholic theological faculty. G√∂cke obtained a second doctorate in, this time in philosophy, in 2013 at the Munich School of Philosophy. The work was supervised by Godehard Br√ºntrup and was published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2014 under the title \\"A Theory of the Absolute\\". From 2008 to 2012 G√∂cke was also a research fellow in Religion and Politics under Klaus M√ºller and from 2010 to 2013 a Junior Research Fellow in Philosophy at Blackfriars, Oxford. From 2012 to 2015 G√∂ck was a postdoctoral fellow at the Faculty of Catholic Theology at the Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum. Since 2016 he has been the group leader of an Emmy Noether project on theology as a science. Following a junior professorship from 2017 to 2019, G√∂cke has been Professor for the Philosophy of Religion and Philosophy of Science since 2019. He has also been an Associate Member of the Faculty of Theology and Religion at the University of Oxford since 2017.  Research  In the field of philosophy of science and metaphysics, G√∂cke's research focuses in on questions about the epistemological positioning of theology. Goecke's work deals with basic research on the theory of science, which tries to specify the concept of scientific in order to develop a criterion to differentiate between sciences and pseudo-sciences. In this context, G√∂cke has given special attention to denominational and scientific theology, and to naturalistic and atheistic objections to the viewing theology as a science. In the field of transhumanism and the ethics of digitization, G√∂cke's research concentrates on the one hand on analyzing the philosophical agenda of transhumanism and the arguments that speak for or against a cybernetic change in the biological nature of humans. G√∂cke's research also investigates the religiously coded assumptions of the transhumanist agenda and its promise of salvation and examines the extent to which elements of transhumanist thought can be supported from a Christian perspective, for example in the context of process theology . In the history of philosophy G√∂cke is a leading specialist on the thought of Karl Christian Friedrich Krause (1781‚Äì1832), which he places in the context of ‚Äúclassical German philosophy‚Äù. G√∂cke has aimed to show that Krause's thinking has been wrongly forgotten. According to G√∂cke, Krause developed the first consistently panentheistic system of philosophy which unites all essential areas of philosophical thought. G√∂cke contends that Krause's work can be directly linked to numerous current discussions in ethics, religious philosophy, anthropology and political philosophy.

They can have circular to oblong forms. Their surface areas reach from some meters (as indentations or holes in the ice) to up to 1 or more kilometers (as bowl shaped depressions). Their existence is connected to ice-volcano interaction in two possible ways: They can be formed in the course of a subglacial eruption or on top of a continuously active subglacial high temperature geothermal area. In both cases, a j√∂kulhlaup may be produced in connection with them. Formation and continued existence of ice cauldrons=Ice cauldrons and subglacial eruptions When an eruption takes place under a bigger glacier, eg. an ice cap, it normally begins with an effusive stage. The heat forms an ice cave and pillow lava is produced. After some time, the eruption has reached a stage where the pressure drops within the ice vault and the eruption style changes to become explosive. Hyaloclastite is produced and the heat is transferred to the meltwater. ‚ÄûAt this stage, the surface ice begins to act brittle and creates concentric fractures that cave in towards the meltwater reservoir. This is referred to as the ice cauldron.‚ÄúS. E. Ackiss: Investing the Mineralogy and Morphology of Subglacial Volcanoes on Earth and Mars. Dissertation. Department of Earth, Atmospheric, & Planetary Sciences West Lafayette, Indiana May 2019. 28 August 2020. When the eruption continues, ‚Äúthe meltwater reservoir becomes so large that the ice cauldron collapses inward towards the edifice, exposing the meltwater reservoir and allowing the breach of both the reservoir and the explosive lava, releasing plumes of gasses and jets of hyaloclastites ‚Äú. The ice cauldron can develop further into an ice canyon, as was the case during the 1996 Gj√°lp eruption. It can continue to exist after the meltwater has left the eruption site and the eruption is terminated. But in most cases, ice flow will fill up the ice cauldron again and make it disappear as soon as the eruption products have cooled down enough.

Background As a result of the Battle of Kuopio and the Swedish offensive into Savonia, a significant amount of Russian troops had been tied up in the fight against Johan August Sandels and his 5th Swedish brigade; On 12 June the Swedes counted not fully 2,000 men while the Russians numbered 8,000 under Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly. The disparity in numbers eventually forced the Swedes to abandon Kuopio on 18 June and withdraw to Toivala, but not without harassing the Russians with guerrilla warfare; on 25 June Sandels commenced a feint attack towards Kuopio while Karl Wilhelm Malm and Joachim Zachris Duncker captured a large Russian convoy between Lepp√§virta and Kuopio ‚Äî the whole operation had cost the Swedes 29 killed or wounded while the Russians had lost, in addition to the convoy, more than 82 men. The strategic effect which followed forced several thousand Russian troops which had marched out from Kuopio to reinforce the main army to the west, to return to Kuopio, against the orders of Fyodor Buxhoeveden. Another Swedish offensive against Kuopio took place on 1 July, which, although ending in an operational failure, resulted in 211 Russian casualties to only 83 Swedes. Battle In mid-July, Barclay de Tolly resigned his command due to health reasons, it was passed over to Nikolay Tuchkov; He immediately ordered the reinforcements, which had been unable to leave due to the increased Swedish activity, to proceed west ‚Äî even without these troops the Russians enjoyed a three to one numerical advantage. However, recent Swedish successes had sparked a peasant uprising against the Russians, which forced Generalmajor Ilya Alekseyev (Alexejev) to give up an attempt to attack the Swedish left flank, and instead retreat all the way to P√§lkj√§rvi, where he awaited reinforcements. Upon hearing news of his retreat, Sandels sent a Swedish force under Malm to pursue- and defeat him before the arrival of Russian reinforcements. Malm's force consisted of 250 regular troops with two guns along with 400 armed peasants who had also joined him. He estimated Alexejev's force to 500 cavalry and four companies of J√§gers ‚Äî in reality, and unbeknownst to Malm, the Russians had already received reinforcements and numbered twice the number of his own force, although lacking in guns. On the night to 10 August, Malm attacked Alexejev's force which was deployed around the P√§lkj√§rvi church; he commenced to a frontal assault with the bulk of his forces (200 regulars and an equal number of peasants, with the artillery) while the rest encircled the Russian left flank. Alexejev managed to halt the first main Swedish attack, but soon, after realizing that he was being encircled combined with renewed frontal attacks, ordered a retreat; he managed to break through the encirclement with relative ease, mostly due to the size of his army. At 9:00 P.M the fighting stopped, Alexejev retreated to Sortavala, briefly pursued by Malm who soon returned to Joensuu. The Swedes had lost 55 in killed or wounded, of which 24 peasants. The Russians had sustained one officer and 90 privates killed or wounded while 53 men were captured. Aftermath Alexejev, who feared a Swedish follow-up on Sortavala, requested reinforcements which he received from the army at Kuopio; although he was soon replaced by Mikhail Petrovich Dolgorukov, who advanced towards the Swedish positions at Toivala only after Sandels had recalled his forward contingents by mid-September. On 29 September Dolgorukov stood at J√§nnevirta, threatening the left flank of the Swedish positions at Toivala; Sandels, however, upon hearing the news of the Swedish defeats at Karstula and Ruona‚ÄìSalmi, combined with the threat at his left flank, ordered a retreat towards Koljonvirta, near Iisalmi. Tuchkov occupied Toivala by 30 September. The armistice at Lohte√•, which was signed on 3 October, further confirmed the Swedish setbacks to the west. Sandels and Tuchkov would encounter each other again at the Battle of Koljonvirta, on 27 October.

But when the Congress was busy in the nationwide Non Cooperation Movement, it somewhat neglected the ongoing Eka Movement. It was this time when Madari Pasi established himself as a charismatic grassroot leader among the kisans involved in the Eka Movement. He united the kisans and petty zamindars from all religions and castes. He pushed the movement in to a violent route. He violently assaulted zamindars, karindas, taluqdars and thikadars and even imprisoned them in their own homes. He began to distribute landowning rights to tenants and petty landholders. His name was associated with dread. Gandhi with his NCM-Khilafat Movement, after hearing about the violent activities of the Eka Movement members, disassociated himself from the Eka Movement. After losing the support of Congress it was much easier for the British authorities to ruthlessly suppress it. By 1922 the movement was completely suppressed. After the crackdown Madari Pasi went underground. He tried to associate the peasants with Hindustan Socialist Republican Association. Even though there is a confusion, it is generally believed that Madari Pasi died on March 27 or 28 in 1931 while underground.

The collection has in it over 2000 manuscript volumes. The bulk of the collection was initially purchased in 1958 by the National Library of Scotland (NLS), with later additions to the collection made by purchase and donation. The collection is stored at the NLS main building on George IV Bridge in Edinburgh, Scotland.  History  Gilbert Eliot, 1st Earl of Minto The founder of the family, Sir Gilbert Elliot, 1st Baronet of Minto (1651 - 1718), was born to Margaret Hay and her husband, Gavin Elliot of Midlem Mill, in Scotland. Elliot was initially a writer, though he began assisting in legal cases and helped William Vietch and the Earl of Argyll escape charges in 1679 and 1691 respectively. He was forced to go into exile in Europe due to the treasonous nature of his role, though he was pardoned by King James VII and returned to Scotland in 1687, where he was admitted to the faculty of Advocates. He later was knighted (in 1682) and became a baronet in 1700. He was appointed as a Lord of Session as Lord Minto in 1705, and added Minto to his property in 1703. Elliot was succeeded by his son, Sir Gilbert Elliot, 2nd Baronet of Minto (1693 - 1766), and his son after him, Sir Gilbert Elliot, 3rd Baronet of Minto, who was both a leading figure in the Scottish Enlightenment and an active politician at Westminster. Sir Gilbert Elliot, 4th Baronet (and, later, 1st Earl) (1751 - 1814), was appointed Governor-General of British India in 1807 and as Earl of Minto in 1813. His eldest son, Gilbert-Elliot- Murray-Kynynmound, 2nd Earl of Minto (1782 - 1859) served as a Cabinet Minister in the Whig Ministries of Grey, Melbourne and Russell. William Hugh, 3rd Earl of Minto (1814 - 1891) was a member of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. His son, Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto (1845 - 1914) was made Governor-General of Canada in 1898 and Viceroy of British India in 1905. The Minto Papers document the activities of the members of the Elliot family, and are a valuable source of study for most aspects of Scottish affairs in the 18th and 19th centuries, including: the local history of Roxburghshire; general British politics; war and diplomacy in Europe; Italian affairs of the 19th century; Canadian affairs in the late 19th century; and the British raj. Previously some letters of David Hume were a part of the collection, though these have moved to Oxford's Bodleian Library.  Scope and Contents  The Minto Papers are made up of 2188 volumes and span over the course of three centuries, telling not only the story of the Eliot family, but also providing important historical knowledge and context. The collection is extensive and as such has been catalogued by subject. There are seven subjects which divide the papers: Family papers; Correspondence; Financial Records; Legal documents; Administrative records; Proceedings and reports; and Estate records. Included in the Minto Papers are multiple volumes on minutes and proceedings, various correspondence to and from family members, papers concerning retrenchment and mutiny, speeches, press cuttings, and microfilms, as well as many other miscellaneous documents.  Related Materials  There are several other collections of documents related to the Elliot family which complement the Minto Papers, namely the papers of Countess Mary Elliot, kept the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford, and the records on the Boston Tea Party compiled by a member of the family, Sir Gilbert Elliot, 3rd Baronet of Minto, (1722 - 1777), at Harvard University's Houghton Library. There are also some related items in the Osborn Collection at Yale University and in the National Maritime Museum in London.

Education and career Chisari graduated in 1963 with a bachelor's degree in biology from Fordham University and in 1968 with an M.D. from Cornell University's Weill Medical College. He was in 1970 and 1971 a fellow in anatomic pathology at the Mayo Clinic and in 1972 a staff associate in immunopathology at the NIH's Laboratory of Pathology. In 1973 he completed his residency in internal medicine at Dartmouth Medical School. At Scripps Research he became a research fellow, then an assistant professor from 1975 to 1981, an associate professor from 1981 to 1988, and a full professor from 1988 to 2015, retiring as professor emeritus in 2105. At Scripps Research he headed the Division of Experimental Pathology from 1988 to 2008 and the Laboratory of Experimental Virology from 2008 to 2015. From 1983 to 1984 he was a Fogarty Scholar in molecular biology at the Institut Pasteur. He is now a scientific advisor for Vir Biotechnology. Chisari is perhaps most famous for his research on viral proteins that can cause hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Chisari's research is important in the immunobiology and pathology of hepatitis-B and hepatitis-C virus (HBV and HCV) infections. His laboratory has developed cell- based models and animal models of HBV and HCV infection and has done T-cell analysis of infected humans, subhuman primates, and transgenic mice. He and his co-workers developed the first transgenic mouse model for pathogenic viruses involved in liver cancer. Their research showed how chronic hepatitis triggers liver cancer (whereby an overproduction of a protein in the virus envelope plays a special role). His group also showed that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) secrete cytokiness that prevent the virus from multiplying in the liver cell without killing the cell. His research also resulted in various approaches for immunotherapy in (chronic) hepatitis, for example, through the body's own activated dendritic cells. (There is a typographical error \\"Rouse-Whipple\\".) Chisari has served on the editorial boards of many scientific journals, including the American Journal of Pathology, Hematology, the Journal of Clinical Investigation, the Journal of Immunology, the Journal of Virology, PLoS Pathogens, Virology, and Current Opinion in Virology. He is the inventor or co-inventor for many patents on various peptides for treating or preventing viral infections caused by hepatitis-B or hepatitis-C.

Both producer and director of his own works, his most notable films are Itch√©ri Kenti, a portrait of Chechen rebels during the 1996 war in Chechnya and Tomorrow Tripoli, a documentary film shot in the heart of the Libyan revolution. His main focus is on how mankind behaves in wartime, the challenges of information in our societies and the prospects for revolutions in the post-Cold War world.  Biography  Florent Marcie began photography in December 1989, during the Romanian revolution. He occasionally collaborates with the written press and institutional media. He is a member of the WARM Foundation.  First filmmaking activities  Florent Marcie made his first documentary, La tribu du tunnel (The Tunnel Tribe) in 1995 in the disused streets of the Petite Ceinture in the 13th arrondissement of Paris. The film was selected at the Documentary Film Festival of Lussas and was broadcast on French TV Canal+ and France 2, in French-speaking Switzerland on TSR and in Canada on SRC. In 1997, he produced the documentary Diary of a Sicilian Rebel (Diario di una siciliana ribelle) made by Italian filmmaker Marco Amenta. The movie was selected in the official competition of the 54th Venice Film Festival. After these two experiences for television, Florent Marcie decided to produce, shoot and edit his films himself. He founded his company No Man's Land. His first feature film Sous les arbres d'Ajiep (Under the trees of Ajiep) is dedicated to the famine that ravaged Sudan in 1998. The film was nominated in official selection at the Cin√©ma du r√©el International Documentary Festival at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. He also contributed to the making-of the film Le Peuple Migrateur (Winged Migration) directed by French director Jacques Perrin in 2001.  Freelance journalist and documentary filmmaking in Afghanistan  In 1999, Florent Marcie published an extensive report in the French newspaper Le Monde about Taliban exactions in the Shamaly Plain during the Afghan War (1996-2001). The journalist revealed that \\"in addition to the strictly military objectives of the Taliban, there is now a desire for large-scale displacement of populations, massacres and systematic destruction\\". In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001, Florent Marcie exhumed his footage shot in Afghanistan and edited two TV news reports for the show Envoy√© sp√©cial on French television France 2. The first, aired on September 13, 2001, revealed the Taliban's plans for attacks in the West, held in the jails of Commander Ahmed Shah Massoud's army. It is broadcast worldwide, most notably in the United States on NBC and in Japan on NHK. The report is chosen as part of the best-of made for the twenty years of Envoy√© Sp√©cial in 2010. The second story, aired on October 4, highlights his investigation about ethnic cleansing in Shamaly province. At the same time, his short experimental film Sa√Øa (Afghanistan, 2000), highlighted by Le Monde critic Jean-Michel Frodon, was screened at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (MOMA). In 2015 Florent Marcie completed the editing of Commandant Khawani, a feature film portraying a young commander on the front line of Bagram in Afghanistan in the 2000s. One of his portraits of Commander Massoud inspired a series of stamps issued by the French and Afghan postal services.  Critical recognition with Itchk√©ri Kenti  In 1996 Florent Marcie went to Chechnya and filmed the war on the rebel side. Captured for three days by the Russian special forces and the FSB, he recounts in a long article for Paris Match in May 1996 \\" hours of interrogations, violence, threats, torture...and the obligation to drink vodka at gunpoint \\". Ten years later, his second feature-length documentary, Itchk√©ri Kenti, les fils d'Itchk√©rie (Itchkeri Kenti, people of Itchkeria), was released in France by MK2 Distribution company on 7 February 2007. The film was also selected at the ACID, the parallel section of the Cannes Film Festival. The movie is a portrait of the Chechen people during the Chechen War of 1996. The film was critically acclaimed, praising both the visual qualities and the historical interest of the film. It was rated 3.9/5 stars by ten press critics on Allocin√©. The French critic C√©cile Mury in T√©l√©rama sums up the film, a \\"long and lively travel diary\\", in these words : > \\"During the winter of 1996, the filmmaker and journalist Florent Marcie, > equipped with an amateur camcorder and two photographic cameras, criss- > crossed this small country at war with the Russian giant. Ten years later, > while Chechnya remains the most heavily mined country in the world, and the > fighting has resumed with renewed vigour, he decided to show this film, > which is strikingly immersed in the heart of one of the greatest > contemporary tragedies (in ten years, more than 200,000 dead, as many > exiles...).\\" French newspaper Le Monde hails \\"an fascinating film\\" and a \\"war film apart\\" in which \\"the spectacle and the movement disappear to give way to the inglorious horror of fear and expectation.\\" For the French critics magazine Les Cahiers du cin√©ma, \\"Itchk√©ri Kenti gives off (...) much more than the staging of the umpteenth Euro-political impasse (...) It is the beauty and the richness of a country that finds its truth closest to the collective experience of a liberation struggle. \\". The critic and former editor-in-chief of the Cahiers du cin√©ma Jean-Michel Frodon considers Florent Marcie to be one of the representatives of the new generation of French documentary.  The Libyan Revolution: Tomorrow Tripoli (2011-2015)  In February 2011, Florent Marcie travels to Libya to record the Libyan Revolution of 2011. He spent eight months alongside the Libyan revolutionaries. The film Tomorrow Tripoli tells the story of the Libyan revolution in the small town of Zintan until the fall of Gaddafi. The filmmaker also contributed to cover the conflict for the national and international press with written articles for Le Monde, television reports and interviews for France 24 and several photographs for Agence France-Presse (publised in the French and international press). During the film's premiere in Sarajevo, 150 ex-revolutionaries chartered a plane from Tripoli to attend. In 2015, the film was presented at a retrospective entitled \\"War Paintings\\" (Peintures de guerre) held at the Cin√©math√®que fran√ßaise as part of the \\"Avant-Garde Cinema\\" programme designed by researcher and curator Nicole Brenez. On this occasion, Agence France-Presse highlighted \\"an exceptional documentary\\" with \\"stunning battle scenes\\" and listed the film as the \\"third part of a long-lasting fresco devoted to men in war. Tomorrow Tripoli was screened as part of the exhibition \\"Soul√®vements\\", organized at the French Gallery Jeu de Paume, Paris. Nicole Brenez wrote a text about it in the exhibition catalogue : > To the traditional couple Disinformation and Counter-information, we must > now add the term Ur-Information, the original information, insofar as it > precedes official information, which exploits it to distort, simplify and > betray it. The end of the 1990s saw the simultaneous blossoming of Counter- > Information collectives such as IndyMedia, and solitary politicians, > practicing visual assault as freely as Albert Londres does literary > reporting. \\" The documentary, supported by the French independent distributor Les Mutins de Pang√©e, has been released in several cinemas in France in the fall of 2019 in the presence of the filmmaker.  The A.I. AT WAR project (2017-2020)  Florent Marcie is currently shooting a film on the journey of an artificial intelligence in a war zone titled \\"A.I. AT WAR\\". He was wounded in the head in January 2019 by a police shooting while filming at a demonstration of the Yellow Vest Movement. Following this, Florent Marcie denounced the abusive use of this weapon by police officers in a column for the online newspaper Mediapart. Florent Marcie attended the Athens Avant-Garde Film Festival in 2019 during which he showed his films and gave a masterclass.  Filmography  * The Tunnel Tribe (La tribu du tunnel, 1995, 49 min).

He was a member of the Liberal Democratic Party and headed one of its most powerful factions in the 1980s.  Early life  Nikaid≈ç was born in Kagoshima Prefecture. He moved to the United States in 1932, and graduated from the University of Southern California with a degree in political science. He remained in the United States until August 1941, when he returned to Japan on the Tatsuta Maru. During World War II, he worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and as a non-combatant in the Imperial Japanese Navy.  Political career  Nikaid≈ç unsuccessfully ran as an opposition candidate for the House of Representatives in the 1942 general election. Following the war, he was involved in the formation of the Japan Cooperative Party (1945) and National Cooperative Party (1947). He won his first elected seat in the House of Representatives in the country's first postwar general election in 1946, lost his bid for re-election in the 1947 general election, and returned to the House in the 1949 general election. During this time, he became acquainted with future political allies Kakuei Tanaka and Takeo Miki. Nikaid≈ç lost his seat again in the 1952 general election, but returned to the House again in the 1955 general election and thereafter held his seat until retiring in 1996, winning 16 consecutive elections. Nikaid≈ç was a supporter of Eisaku Sat≈ç's Diet faction starting in 1957, and served in the Sato cabinet as Director of the Science and Technology Agency and Director of the Hokkaido Development Agency from 1966 to 1967. He later became a key supporter of Kakuei Tanaka, and served as Tanaka's Chief Cabinet Secretary from 1972 to 1974. Nikaid≈ç served as LDP Secretary-General from 1981 to 1983, during which time Tanaka was convicted of bribery for his role in the Lockheed bribery scandals (in which Nikaid≈ç himself was not implicated). In 1984, former Prime Minister Zenk≈ç Suzuki backed Nikaid≈ç, who was then 75, in an ill-fated party leadership struggle against Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. Nikaid≈ç thereafter served as LDP Vice-President from 1984 to 1986. During this time, Tanaka was hospitalized following a stroke, and Nikaid≈ç served as titular chairman of the Tanaka faction, but was challenged by Noboru Takeshita. Nikaid≈ç died of heart failure in February 2000 at the age of 90.  Amami reversion movement  As a lawmaker representing Kagoshima Prefecture, Nikaid≈ç played some role in the reversion movement of the Amami Islands, which were part of Kagoshima Prefecture but were administratively separated from Japan by the U.S. military from 1946 to 1953. In July 1950, on his way back from a visitation to Okinawa, Nikaod≈ç visited Amami ≈åshima and gave a speech at a mass rally calling for Amami's return to Japan. On August 18, he asked an \\"emergency question\\" on Amami's reversion to Japan at a Lower House plenary session. The question was a political compromise between the Diet and the Amami Islanders since the Diet was unable to pass a resolution on Amami's reversion that would conflict with a peace treaty the Diet was soon to ratify. Nevertheless, it was the first manifestation of long-standing efforts to single out Amami from the other areas under U.S. military occupation (i.e., Okinawa and Ogasawara) at the Diet to facilitate an earlier return of Amami.

This period in the territories of today's Azerbaijan Republic begins with the incorporation of these territories into the Sasanian Persian Empire in the 3rd century AD. Feudalism started to shape in Azerbaijan in the Early Middle Ages. The territories of Caucasian Albania became an arena of wars between the Byzantine Empire and the Sassanid Empire. After the fall of the Sassanid Empire by the Arab Caliphate, Albania also weakened, and in 705 AD it was overthrown by the Abbasid Caliphate under the name of Arran. As the control of the Arab Caliphate over the Caucasus region weakened, independent states began to emerge in the territory of Azerbaijan.  Sassanid conquest = History  Sassanid Empire 226-651 (AD) Around 227 AD Atropatene, and in 252-253 AD, Caucasian Albania were conquered and annexed by the Sassanid Empire. Atropatene was included to the Sassanid's north marzbans and Albania became a vassal state of the Sassanid Empire, but retained its monarchy; the Albanian king had no real power and most civil, religious, and military authority lay with the Sassanid marzban (military governor) of the territory. After Sassanids‚Äô victory over Romans in 260 AD, this victory, as well as, the annexation of Albania and Atropatene were described in the trilingual inscription of Shapur I at the Ka‚Äôbe-ye Zarto≈°t at Naq≈°-e Rostam. Relative of Sasanian Shapur II (309-379), Urnayr was brought to power in Albania (343-371), and he followed a partially independent policy in foreign policy, Urnayr allied with the Sasanian king Shapur II. According to Ammianus Marcellinus, the Albanians provided military forces (especially cavalry) to the Shapur II armies in their attacks against the Romans, especially during the siege of Amida (359), which ended with the victory of the Sassanid army and as a result, Arsakh, Marlar (now Nakhichevan), Caspiana and other regions of Albania were returned. He also noted that the Albanian cavalry was to play a determinative role in the siege of Amida, like the Chionites (Xionites). The Albanians received an honorary degree for being Shapur's military ally. After this victory, king Shapur II started to oppress the Christian religion in Albania. ‚ÄúClose by him [≈†apur II] on the left went Grumbates, king of the Chionitae, a man of moderate strength, it is true, and with shrivelled limbs, but of a certain greatness of mind and distinguished by the glory of many victories. On the right was the king of the Albani, of equal rank, high in honour‚Äù. In 371, the battle of Dzirav (also known as the battle of Bagavan) took place between the Romans and Sassanid armies. Albania was the Sassanid's ally in this battle too. The battle resulted in the victory of the Roman army. Urnayr was wounded and Albania was deprived of provinces like Uti, Shakashena (Sakasena), Colt (Albania's western border province) and Girdiman valley in this battle. Albania returned its lost provinces with the deal signed between Rome and Sasanids in 387. Caucasian Albania (historical map) In 450, the Sasanian army was defeated by the insurgents of Cristian faith against Persian Zoroastrianism of King Yazdegerd II in the battle near the city of Khalkhal (present Gazakh region) and Albania was cleaned from Persian garrisons. After the death of Yazdegerd II, intestine fought began for the throne in Iran between Yazdegerd's sons Hormuzd and Peroz. The return to Christianity of Vache II resulted in a war between Persia and Caucasian Albania and Vache II declared his recalcitrancy to new Sasanian ShahenShah Peroz. After this distrust, Peroz raised the Haylandur (Onoqur) Huns to fight the Albanian monarch. They occupied Albania in 462. This fight ended with getting off the throne of Vache II in 463. M. Kalankatli wrote that Albania has remained without a ruler for 30 years. The northern part of Azerbaijan was turned into marzbanianity of Sasanian Empire. According to M. Kalankatli, almost, 30 years later, the monarchy of local rulers was reestablished in Albania by the nephew of II Vache- Vachagan III-(487-510). Vachagan Barepa≈° (pious) was admitted to the throne by Sassanid shah Balash (Valarsh) (484-488). Vachagan III restored the concessions of the Albanian tsars, reduced taxes, and granted freedoms to Christians. Independent state institutions were eliminated in the South Caucasus by Sassanids in 510. Governor-generals of Sassanid began a long period (510-629) of domination in Albania. In the late 6th to early 7th centuries, the territory of Albania became an arena of wars between Sassanid Persia, Byzantium, and the Khazar Khanate, the latter two very often acting as allies against Sassanid Persia. In 628, during the Third Perso-Turkic War, the Khazars invaded Albania, and their leader Ziebel declared himself Lord of Albania, levying a tax on merchants and the fishermen of the Kura and Araxes rivers \\"in accordance with the land survey of the kingdom of Persia\\". The reign of the Mihranids dynasty (630-705) arrived in Albania in the early 7th century. This dynasty originated from Girdiman province (now Shamkir-Gazakh region of Azerbaijan) of Albania. Partav (now Barda) was the centre of this dynasty. According to M. Kalankatli, initiator of the Mehranids‚Äô dynasty was Mehran (570-590), and the representative was Varaz Grigor (628-642) who took the title of ‚Äúprince of Albania‚Äù. Partav (Berde) was the capital city of Albania during the reign of Varaz Grigor's son Javanshir (642-681). Javanshir showed his obedience to the Sassanid shah Yazdegerd III (632-651) in the first period of his reign. He was the head of Albanian army as sparapet and alliance of Yazdegerd III in the years of 636‚Äì642. Despite the Arab victory in the battle of Kadissia in 637, Javanshir fought as an ally of the Sassanids. After the fall of the Sassanid Empire by the Arab Caliphate in 651, Javanshir changed his policy and moved to Byzantine emperor's side in 654. Konstantin II took Javanshir under his protection. Javanshir became a ruler of the Albanian country thanks to the protection of Byzantium. In 662, Javanshir defeated the Khazars near the Kura River. Three years later (665), the Khazars attacked again Albania with greater force and won. According to the agreement signed between Javanshir and the head of the Khazars, the Albanians agreed to pay tribute every year. In return, the Khazars returned all the captives and looted cattle. The Albanian ruler established diplomatic relations with the Caliphate in order to protect his country from the invasion of the Caspian Sea. For this purpose, he went to Damascus and met with the caliph Muaviya (667, 670). As a result, the caliphate did not touch Albania's internal independence, and at the request of Javanshir, Albania's taxes were reduced by a third. Javanshir was assassinated in 681 by Byzantine feudal lords. After his death, the Khazars attacked and plundered Albania again. Arab troops entered Albania in 705 and took Javanshir's last heir to Damascus and put him to death. Thus, the rule of the Mihrani dynasty ended in Albania. Albania's internal independence was abolished. Albania started to be ruled by the Caliph's successor.  Religion  According to local tradition, Christianity entered Caucasian Albania in the 1st century through St. Elis√¶us of Albania, a disciple of St. Thaddeus of Edessa. The first Christian church in South Caucasus was established in Caucasian Albania by St. Elishe in the village of Kish in the region of Uti (now Sheki district, north-western Azerbaijan). This church was regarded by Caucasian Albanians as their \\"mother church\\" which laid the foundation of institutionalized Christianity in the kingdom. At the beginning of the IV century, monophysite Albanian church became a state institution as an apostolic church. In the reign of king U·πônayr who was baptized by St. Gregory, Caucasian Albania officially adopted Christianity and it started to gradually spread. According to the Azerbaijani historian Ismail bey Zerdabli, during the reign of Sasanian emperor Yazdegerd I (399-420), Albanian church was developed, and a lot of concessions were given to them. On the contrary, due to Yazdegerd II‚Äôs attempts to strengthen royal centralisation in the bureaucracy by imposing Zoroastrianism on the Christians within the country, Zoroastrianism became spread between Albanians. Moisey Klankatlu wrote that ‚Äústrict order of the ShahenShah obliged us to stop worshipping our religion and accept pagan religion of mags‚Äù. In the mid-5th century, under Albanian king Vache II (440-463) - nephew of Yazdegerd II, Caucasian Albania refused Christianity and adopted Zoroastrianism because of the Persian influence. In Albania, Christian churches were turned into temples, and Christianity was severely persecuted. After Yazdagerd II died in 457, Vache II changed his internal policy. He rejected the Zoroastrianism religion and returned to Christianity. By extending Christianity to Albania, his goal was to get rid of the Sassanid rule. In the monarchy of Vachagan III, in 498, in the settlement named Aluen (Aghuen) (present day Agdam region of Azerbaijan), an Albanian church council convened to adopt laws further strengthening the position of Christianity in Albania. During the council, a twenty-one-paragraph codex formalizing and regulating the important aspects of the Church's structure, functions, relationship with the state, and legal status was adopted. Vachagan III took an active part in Christianizing Caucasian Albanians and appointing clergy to monasteries throughout his kingdom.  Socio-economic and cultural life  During the Sassanid period, two types of land ownership in Albania and Atropatene were common: hereditary land ownership- Dastgerd and conditional land ownership- Khostak. Dastgerd formed at the result of the collapse of communal land ownership, was distributed among the representatives of the ruling class by the state. Khostak was given to feudal aristocracy in exchange for their vassal services. In Albania, the position of community land ownership was also strong. Free peasants with community land have existed here for a long time. Community peasants paid taxes to the ruler's treasury and performed certain duties. In Atropatene, the population divided into four sections: priests, military officers, scribes, and taxpaying class. In the 5th and 6th centuries, the formation of the feudal class in Albania was completed: this class was expressed in many different terms, mainly \\"azat\\" and \\"naharar\\", which corresponded to the peasants-shinakan. The naharars were tax-free. Their main task was military service to the ruler, and at first, they ruled entire provinces or districts. During the reign of Khosrow I (512-514), all men aged 20‚Äì50 were taxed in Azerbaijan, except for priests, scribes, aristocracy, and officers. In the early medieval ages, there were many defence fortress and hurdles in the territory of Azerbaijan. Shirvan wall was constructed along the river Gilgil, 23 kilometers to the north from Beshbarmag wall. Beshbarmag wall began from the shore of the Caspian Sea and lasted till Babadagh and Gilgilchay. Chiraggala was situated on the top of the mountain in the Guba Forest. Another hurdle was built on the north side of the river Saumur. Fortresses like Torpaggala (on the bank of the river Alazan), Govurgala (Aghdam region), Javanshir gala (Ismailli region) and Charabkert gala (Aghdara region) were built during the Sassanid rule.  Arab conquest = History  After the battles of Jalula (637), Nahavand and Hamadan in 642 between the Arab-Sassanids, the Arabs launched attacks against Azerbaijan. According to al-Tabari, ‚ÄúAzerbaijan was conquered in the year of 22 of Hijri‚Äù (642-643). Defeating Sasanids in the battle of Nahavand, the Arabs opened a gateway to the province of Azerbaijan and the territory of Caucasian Albania. The Muslims then invaded Azerbaijan and drew up an agreement with the local population according to which Azerbaijan was surrendered to Caliph Umar on usual terms of paying the annual Jizya. Following years, local people rebelled against Arabs, therefore, the new Caliph Osman sent an army under the ladership of al-Walid ibn Ukba to Azerbaijan in 644‚Äì645. A new treaty with more heavy arrangements was concluded between the sides. Al-Walid sent a group of his army to the North passing the river Aras under Salman b. Rabia, and to Nakjavan (Nakhchevan) under Habib b. Maslama. Habib ended up with a treaty with the population of Nakjavan taxed to them jezya and kharaj, while the army of Salman moved to the direction of Arran, and captured Beylagan. Then, the Arabs attacked to Barda, faced here with the resistance of local people. After a while, Barda population had to conclude the treaty with Arabs. Salman continued his expedition to the left bank of the river Kura and concluded treaties with the governors of Gabala, Sheki, Shakashƒìn and Shirvan. In 652, BƒÅb al-AbwƒÅb (Darband) was conquered by the Arabs. After Darband, Salman continued his campaign through the Kazar Khaganate, however, he lost the battle and was killed. Caliphate again sent an army to the Caucasus under the leadership of Habib b. Maslam in 655. During the period of Arab invasions to Caucasus, southern parts of the territories of Azerbaijan as part of Adurbadagan completely lost its independence, while Caucasian Albania subordinated to Arabs only as vassal. Arab Conquests = Khazar-Arab wars = Due to the outbreak of the First Muslim Civil War and the priorities on other fronts, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century. The Khazars, on their part, only launched a few raids into the Transcaucasian principalities that were loosely under Muslim dominion: in a raid into Albania in 661/662, they were defeated by the local prince, but in 683 or 685 (also a time of civil war in the Muslim world), a large-scale raid across Transcaucasia was more successful, capturing much booty and many prisoners. At the beginning of the 8th century, territories of Azerbaijan was the center of the Caliphate ‚Äì Khazar and Byzantine wars. In 722‚Äì723, Khazars attacked the territories of South Caucasus under the Arabs‚Äô rules and as a result, an Arabian army led by al-Jarrah al-Hakami was swiftly successful in driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, and fought his way north along the western coast of the Caspian Sea, recovering Derbent and advancing onto the Khazar capital of Balanjar, captured the capital of the Khazar khanate and placed prisoners around Gabala. Then al-Jarrah returned to Sheki with the booty and a large number of captives and placed his army here. In 730, after the Khazars looted many cities in Azerbaijan and defeated the Arab armies (Battle of Ardabil, 730), then the Arabs began a campaign of revenge. During the early 730s, the Arabs and Khazars were fighting over Derbent, as a result in 732, the city came into Arab control led by Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik. The Arabs again defeated Khazars in 737 and Arab forces under Marwan ibn Muhammed moved into the central parts of Khazar Khaganate passing through ‚Äúthe Gates of the Alans‚Äù. Marwan returned the south of the Caucasus after capturing Khazar kagan. Thus, the attempts of Khazars to control the South Caucasus were unsuccessful. = Uprisings against Chaliphate  Causes  Internal conflicts within the Umayyads ranks, intensification of discontent among the people under control led to a socio-political crisis in the Caliphate. In the early days of the Abbasid rule, Azerbaijan was the center of a protracted revolt against the caliphate. Abbasids‚Äô coming to the throne in the middle of the 8th century did not facilitate the situation and life of the population in Arran and Azerbaijan. Starting from the Abbasids period, only a few part of the taxes were paid by natural means (as natura, food collected instead of currency) on the contrary to the Umayyads, while they collected all the taxes as natura.  First rebellions  In 748, a revolt against the Umayyad dynasty took place in Beylagan under the leadership of Musafir ibn Kesir, nicknamed \\"al-kassab\\". The inspiration for this uprising was al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Shebani, the leader of the Kharijites. The local feudal lords Ibban ibn Mansur and Hatib ibn Sadal, who were on the side of the caliphate and defended their own interests, attacked Beylagan. The rebellious inhabitants of Arran captured the fortress of Beylagan and released all the prisoners excluding the Emir. Inspired by this success, the rebels marched on Barda, crushed the Arab garrison, and assassinated the local governor, Asim ibn Yazid. The punitive army sent by the Umayyads could not repel this revolt. With the change of power in the Caliphate, the Abbasids were able to counterbalance the rebellions against the caliphate. The people of Beylagan were vanquished, the leaders of the uprisings along with Musafir were killed. The locals of Shamkir revolted against the Arabic migrants who settled in the city in 752, but the Abbasids soon put down this revolt as well.  Khurramites and BƒÅbak Khorramdin  The Khurramites were a religious and political movement against the Arabs Caliphate and often recognized as survival of the Zoroastrian heresy, Mazdakism. According to al-Tabari, their name first appared in 736 when missionary Kedas of Hasemite adopted ‚Äúdin al-·∏¥orramiya‚Äù, and after Hasemite revolution the khorramis were fought as rebels under Sonbadh, Moqanna, Babak and other different leaders in the various cities and regions. One of the researchers of the Khorrami uprising in Azerbaijani historiography, academician Z.Buniadov stated that, the peasant masses of Azerbaijan (especially in the mountainous region) maintained their pro-Islamic beliefs associated with Zoroastrianism and Mazdakism. The pretext for the revolt was that the Arabs collected most of the agricultural produce from the peasants as taxes (kharaj). The socio-economic struggle of the Khurramites was the excess of taxes and the exploitation of property. All lands were to be given to the peasants for free and cultivated together. The Khurramites tried to free the peasants from feudal dependence, to equalize state taxes and communities. The movement of Khurramites in Azerbaijan was associated with Javidhan who was a landlord leader of one of the two Khurramite movements in Azerbaijan (from 807‚Äì808 to 816-817), with his headquarters being in Badd located close to the river Aras. The leader of the other Khurramite movement was Abu Imran, who often clashed with Javidhans forces. During one of the clashes, in probably 816, Abu Imran was defeated and killed, whilst Javidhan was mortally wounded, dying three days later. Javidhan was succeeded by his apprentice Babak Khorramdin, who also married Javidhan's widow. Tabari records that Babak started his revolt in 816‚Äì817. At first, Al-Ma'mun paid little attention to Babak's uprising because of the difficulty of intervening from distant Khorasan, the appointment of his successor, and the actions of al-Fadl ibn Sahl. Such conditions paved the way for Babak and his supporters. Caliph Al- Ma'mun sent general Yahya ibn Mu'adh fought against Babak in 819‚Äì820, but could not defeat him several times. Two years later Babak overcome the forces of Isa ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Khalid. In 824‚Äì825 the Caliphate generals Ahmad ibn al Junayd and Zorayq b.  øAlƒ´ b. ·π¢adaqa were sent for subdue Babak øs revolt. Babak defeated them and captured Jonayd. In 827‚Äì828 Mo·∏•ammad b. ·∏§omayd was sent to overcome Babak. Though his several victories, in the last battle at Hashtadsar in 829, his troops were defeated by Babak. Caliph Al-Ma'mun's moves against Babak had failed when he died in 833. Babak's victories over Arab generals were associated with his possession of Badd fort and inaccessible mountain stronghold according to the Arab historians who mentioned that his influence also extended to the territories of today's Azerbaijan - ‚Äúsouthward to near Ardabil and Marand, eastward to the Caspian Sea and the Shamakhi district and Shervan, northward to the Muqan (Mo·∏°an) steppe and the Aras river bank, westward to the districts of Jolfa, Nakjavan, and Marand‚Äù. In 833, a great number of men from Jebal, Hamadan and Isfahan joined the Khorrami movement and settled near Hamadan. The new caliph al- Mutasim sent troops under Es·∏•ƒÅq b. EbrƒÅhƒ´m b. Mo·π£ øab. The Khorramis were defeated in the battle near Hamadan. According to Tabari and Ibn al-'Asir, 60,000 khurramites were killed. In 835, al-Mutasim sent Khaydhar ibn Kawus al- Afshin a senior general and a son of the vassal prince of Osrushana to defeat Babak. Al-Mutasim set unusually large fees and expense allowances for Afshin. According to Saeed Nafisi, Afshin managed to attract Babak's spies on his side by paying much more money than Babak. When Afshin knew that Babak was aware of Bugha al-Kabir had been sent with a large amount of money for Afshin and preparing for an attack against Bugha, he used this information to drag Babak's full engagement where he succeeded to have Babak's comrades killed and Babak himself got away to Badd. Before Afshin's departure, caliph sent a group under Abu Said Mo·∏•ammad to reconstruct the forts demolished by Babak between Zanjan and Ardabil. Khurramites under Muawiyah attacked the Arabs but they were able to overcome the Khurramites which was recorded by Tabari as Babak's first defeat. The last battle between the Arab caliphate and the Khurramites took place in the fortress of Badd on 837. The Khurramites were defeated and Afshin reached the Badd. After capturing the Badd fortress, Babak came near the Araz River. His goal was to unite with the Byzantine emperor, gather new forces and continue the struggle. Thus, it was announced that the caliph Al- Mu'tasim would give a reward of 2 million dirhams to the person who handed him over alive. Babak's former ally, Sahl ibn Sumbat, handed Babak over to the Abbasid Caliphate, and on March 14, 838, Babak was executed in the city of Samarra. The Khurramites movement has intensified anti-Arab protests in many cities of Azerbaijan. During the weakening of the Arab caliphate, independent states began to emerge in the territory of Azerbaijan.  Management policy  Under the Rashiduns and early Umayyads, the administrative system of the late Sassanid period was largely retained, each quarter of the state was divided into provinces, the provinces into districts, and the districts into sub-districts. Then caliphate created the Emirate system to manage large areas. During the Abbasid period, the number of emirates increased. In their turn, emirates were divided into mahals and mantagas. The person who ruled the emirate was called emir and appointed by the Caliph. The territories of Azerbaijan was first included in the fourth emirate, then in the third one. The Caliphate army initially had only Muslims as regular soldiers. While the other territories were conquested under the Caliphate, non-Arab local people who converted to Islam were allowed to join the army. Eventually non-Muslims who were called Dhimmis also allowed to join the army with being exacted from paying jizya. In addition, the Arabs relocated tens of thousands of Arab families from Basra, Kufa, Syria and Arabia to Azerbaijan in order to create a more reliable social base for themselves and to Arabize the population. Taxes under the Arabs coquest in the territories of Azerbaijan were divided into jizya, kharaj, khums. Jizya was levied in the form of financial charge on permanent non-Muslim subjects (dhimmis): kharaj was a tax on agricultural land and its produce. Sometimes a dhimmi was exempted from jizya if he rendered some valuable services to the state. Khums was taken as a fifth of movable property and fertile lands. Muslim population also paid Zakat as a form of alms-giving treated in Islam as a religious obligation or tax. Zakat (charity tax) was levied on livestock, plant and fruit products, gold and silver, and handicrafts. Zakat was spent on the needs of the clergy, orphans and the disabled. Absheron oil sources and salt lakes were also taxed.  Economic life  The previously slow-growing rice industry began to grow rapidly and began to play a more important role in the economic life of Azerbaijan. In the 9th and 10th centuries, rice cultivation was widespread in Shabran, Shirvan, Sheki and Lankaran regions. Cultivation of flax and cotton were common in Azerbaijan at that time. Artificial irrigation of Mughan, Mil and other plains created special conditions for the increasing of cotton growing. The development of trade created conditions for the rapid development of camel breeding. In the Middle Ages, dromedary and two-humped camels were used in Azerbaijan. Due to their characteristics, camels were also widespread in the mountainous regions of Azerbaijan, where the semi-nomadic form of livestock predominated.  Cities  In the ninth century, weaving became a highly developed field in Azerbaijani cities. Al-Istakhri and Hudud al-Alam (10th century) stated that there was no city equal to Barda, which planted many trees and produced much silk. Among the other regions of Arran, silkworm breeding also developed in Shabran and Shirvan. At that time, Barda, known as the \\"Mother of Arran\\" and the residence of the caliph's rulers, was the largest place not only in Azerbaijan, but in the whole Caucasus. Barda's ‚ÄúKurki‚Äù bazaar‚Äù was one of the most popular bazaars in the Middle East. Gandja was one of the biggest cities of Azerbaijan during Caliphate authority. According to the Azerbaijani historian Ismayil bey Zerdabli, Gandja was an ‚Äúessential city‚Äù, ‚Äúpossessed fortification, great cattle with high walls‚Äù and it was ‚Äúthe last forepast of Muslim world in frontiers‚Äù. Local artisans made clothes, carpets, wooden utensils made of Khalandj (iron tree) for the interior and foreign markets of Nakhchivan. The cities of Shirvan and Shamakhi were famous for their silk products. Silk and silk clothes were exported to other cities in the Caucasus and the Middle East.

Background Hagerstein was born in Helsinki in 1757, at a time when Finland was part of Sweden; therefore his nationality was Finnish, but in some sources he is instead described as a Swedish citizen. It is possible that 'Peter Hagerstein' was not his name at birth, but was anglicised when he became a sailor; his original name may have been Pehr Hagersten. Not much is known of his early life, until he was hired as a deckhand on the British merchant ship HMS Daedalus when it called in the port of Helsinki around 1790. Shortly afterwards, Daedalus joined the Vancouver Expedition of 1791-1795 as a support ship, with Hagerstein in the crew. He sailed with the ship from England, around Cape Horn to Hawaii, Nootka Island in British Columbia, and eventually to Tahiti. Tahiti years The Cession of the District of Matavai, by Robert Smirke In February 1793, Hagerstein deserted Daedalus in Tahiti, and is on record as having 'gone native', eventually learning the Tahitian language, marrying a local woman and settling down. He is described in various sources as having made his living initially as a beachcomber. Thanks to his language skills and understanding of western culture, Hagerstein found a role as translator/interpreter and influential advisor to Kings P≈çmare I and P≈çmare II, mediating and assisting the Kings in dealing with traders, missionaries and other visitors. He is portrayed in a central position in the painting The Cession of the District of Matavai in the Island of Otaheite to Captain James Wilson for the use of the Missionaries Sent Thither by that Society in the Ship Duff, by Robert Smirke, commemorating a land grant for the building of a mission in Tahiti. His knowledge of firearms led to Hagerstein also becoming involved in the King's military, and he was eventually promoted to the position of chief warrior. Later on Hagerstein appears to have fallen out of favour with King P≈çmare II, to the extent where he considered switching his allegiance to a rival chief. He nevertheless remained associated with the King. He had at least one child of his own with a local woman, and looked after two other children. Peter Hagerstein died in Tahiti in 1810, possibly from complications arising from elephantiasis, which had afflicted him for long.

The formulation of this theorem as a game is due to Aharoni, Berger and Ziv.  Description  The game-board is a graph G. It is a zero-sum game for two players, CON and NON. CON wants to show that I(G), the independence complex of G, has a high connectivity; NON wants to prove the opposite. At his turn, CON chooses an edge e from the remaining graph. NON then chooses one of two options: * Disconnection ‚Äì remove the edge e from the graph. * Explosion ‚Äì remove both endpoints of e, together with all their neighbors and the edges incident to them. The score of CON is defined as follows: * If at some point the remaining graph has an isolated vertex, the score is infinity; * Otherwise, at some point the remaining graph contains no vertex; in that case the score is the number of explosions. For every given graph G, the game value on G (i.e., the score of CON when both sides play optimally) is denoted by Œ®(G).  Game value and homological connectivity  Meshulam proved that, for every graph G: > \\\\eta_H(I(G))\\\\geq \\\\Psi(G) where \\\\eta_H(I(G)) is the homological connectivity of I(G) plus 2. It is conjectured that this inequality is tight.  Examples  1\\\\. If G has k connected components, then Œ®(G) ‚â• k. Regardless of the order in which CON offers edges, each explosion made by NON destroys vertices in a single component, so NON needs at least k explosions to destroy all vertices. 2\\\\. If G is a union of k vertex-disjoint cliques, each of which contains at least two vertices, then Œ®(G) = k, since each explosion completely destroys a single clique. 3\\\\. If G has an independence domination number of at least k, i \\\\gamma(G) \\\\geq k, then \\\\Psi(G)\\\\geq k. Proof: Let A be an independent set with domination number at least k. CON starts by offering all edges (a,b) where a is in A. If NON disconnects all such edges, then the vertices of A remain isolated so CON's score is infinity. If NON explodes such an edge, then the explosion removes from A only the vertices that are adjacent by b (the explosion at a does not destroy vertices of A, since A is an independent set). Therefore, the remaining vertices of A require at least k-1 vertices to dominate, so the domination number of A decreased by at most 1. Therefore, NON needs at least k explosions to destroy all vertices of A. This proves that \\\\Psi(G)\\\\geq i\\\\gamma(G). * Note: this also implies that \\\\Psi(L(G))\\\\geq u(G)/2, where u(G) is the size of the largest matching in G. This is because the matchings in G are the independent sets in L(G). Each edge in G is a vertex in L(G), and it dominates at most two edges in the matching (= vertices in the independent set). * Similarly, when H is an r-partite hypergraph, \\\\Psi(L(H))\\\\geq u(H)/r. 4\\\\. If G is the line graph of the complete bipartite graph Kn,n, then \\\\Psi(L(G))\\\\geq \\\\lfloor 2n/3\\\\rfloor. Proof: G can be seen as an n-by-n array of cells, where each row is a vertex on one side, each column is a vertex on the other side, and each cell is an edge. In the graph L(G), each cell is a vertex, and each edge is a pair of two cells in the same column or the same row. CON starts by offering two cells in the same row; if NON explodes them, then CON offers two cells in the same column; if NON explodes them again, then the two explosions together destroy 3 rows and 3 columns. Therefore, at least \\\\lfloor 2n/3\\\\rfloor explosions are required to remove all vertices. * Note: this result was generalized later: if F is any subgraph of Kn,n, then \\\\Psi(L(G))\\\\geq \\\\frac{F}{n} - \\\\frac{n}{3} - \\\\frac{1}{2}.

The neighbors of node #2, on the other hand, have more connections, so the link with #2 is one of many. Distinctiveness centrality is a network centrality measure, used in graph analysis. It is similar to degree centrality, but weighted in order to attribute higher importance to distinctive, non-redundant, connections. In general, many traditional centrality metrics attribute less importance to nodes‚Äô connections with the network periphery. Distinctiveness centrality, on the other hand, attributes more importance to nodes that have links to loosely-connected peers. Distinctiveness penalizes redundant connections.  Calculation  There are five different metrics that can be used to calculate distinctiveness centrality ‚Äì namely D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5. They only differ with regard to the weighting factor used. In addition, only D1, D3 and D4 are designed to consider arc weights. Formulas are presented for a (weighted) undirected graph G, made of n nodes and m arcs. If two nodes, i and j, are not connected, then w_{ij}=0, otherwise w_{ij} \\\\ge 1. If the graph is unweighted, each arc weight is considered equal to 1. In the following, g_j is the degree of node j and I_{(f)} is the indicator function which equals 1 if f=\\\\text{TRUE}, i.e. if there is an arc connecting nodes i and j. An exponent \\\\alpha \\\\ge 1 is used in the formulas to allow a stronger penalization of connections with highly connected nodes. D1 of node i is calculated as: : D_1 (i) = \\\\sum_{j=1, j eq i}^n w_{ij} \\\\log_{10}\\\\frac{n-1}{{g_j}^\\\\alpha}. D2 of node i is calculated as: : D_2 (i) = \\\\sum_{j=1,j eq i}^n \\\\log_{10}\\\\frac{n-1}{{g_j}^\\\\alpha}I_{(w_{ij}>0)}. D3 of node i is calculated as: : D_3 (i) = \\\\sum_{j=1,j eq i}^n w_{ij}\\\\log_{10} \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k,\\\\ell=1,k eq\\\\ell}^n \\\\frac{w_{k\\\\ell}}{2}}{ \\\\sum_{k=1,k eq j}^n {{w_{jk}}^\\\\alpha}-{w_{ij}}^\\\\alpha+1}. D4 of node i is calculated as: : D_4(i) = \\\\sum_{j=1,j eq i}^n w_{ij} \\\\frac{{w_{ij}}^\\\\alpha}{\\\\sum_{k=1,k eq j}^n {w_{jk}}^\\\\alpha}. D5 of node i is calculated as: : D_5 (i) = \\\\sum_{j=1,j eq i}^n \\\\frac{1}{{g_j}^\\\\alpha} I_{(w_{ij}>0)}.  Directed networks  It is possible to extend distinctiveness centrality to directed networks, in order to value incoming arcs more, if they originate at nodes with low out-degree. Indeed, a connection from a node sending arcs towards all other nodes is considered of little value. Let‚Äôs take the case of Sarah receiving a love- letter from Jessica, who is sending love-letters to all people in the neighborhood. The letter is much less important to Sarah than the case of Jessica only sending one letter (to Sarah). Similarly, outgoing arcs are valued more if they reach peers with low in-degree. This means that if Sarah receives a love letter from Jessica only, she will pay much more attention to it than the case of receiving many love letters, from all the people in the neighborhood.

Diamonds have been found in association with gold in the upper part of the Bima. Colonial era Around November 1890 the Zanzibar Arab Mirambo arrived in the Uele region, starting from a point on the Aruwimi River upstream from Yambuya. Passing the Rubi River he went NNE through Bagbwe and Bayo territory, and installed himself on the Bima near the Titul√© post, having obtained the submission of the Bayo people, who supplied auxiliaries to attack the neighbouring people.

The theory revolves around the complex zeros of partition functions of finite-size systems and how these may reveal the existence of phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit. Lee‚ÄìYang theory constitutes an indispensable part of the theories of phase transitions. Originally developed for the Ising model, the theory has been extended and applied to a wide range of models and phenomena, including protein folding, percolation, complex networks, and molecular zippers. The theory is named after the Nobel laureates Tsung-Dao Lee and Yang Chen-Ning, who were awarded the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on parity nonconservation of weak interaction.  Introduction  For an equilibrium system in the canonical ensemble, all statistical information about the system is encoded in the partition function, :Z = \\\\sum_i e^{-\\\\beta E_i}, where the sum runs over all possible microstates, and \\\\beta =1/(k_B T) is the inverse temperature, k_B is the Boltzmann constant and E_i is the energy of a microstate. The moments \\\\langle E^n \\\\rangle of the energy statistics are obtained by differentiating the partition function with respect to the inverse temperature multiple times, :\\\\langle E^n \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{Z} \\\\partial^n_{-\\\\beta} Z = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_i E_i^n e^{-\\\\beta E_i}}{\\\\sum_i e^{-\\\\beta E_i}}. From the partition function, we may also obtain the free energy :F = -\\\\beta^{-1} \\\\log[Z]. Analogously to how the partition function generates the moments, the free energy generates the cumulants of the energy statistics :\\\\langle !\\\\langle E^n \\\\rangle !\\\\rangle = \\\\partial^n_{-\\\\beta} (-\\\\beta F). More generally, if the microstate energies E_i(q) =E_i(0)-q\\\\Phi_i depend on a control parameter q and a fluctuating conjugate variable \\\\Phi (whose value may depend on the microstate), the moments of \\\\Phi may be obtained as :\\\\langle \\\\Phi^n \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{Z}\\\\beta^{-n}\\\\partial^n_{q} Z(q) =\\\\frac{1}{Z} \\\\beta^{-n}\\\\partial^n_{q} \\\\sum_i e^{-\\\\beta E_i(q)}= \\\\frac{\\\\sum_i \\\\Phi_i^n e^{\\\\beta E_i(0)+\\\\beta q \\\\Phi_i}}{\\\\sum_i e^{\\\\beta E_i(0)+\\\\beta q \\\\Phi_i}}, and the cumulants as :\\\\langle !\\\\langle \\\\Phi^n \\\\rangle !\\\\rangle = \\\\beta^{-n}\\\\partial^n_{q} [-\\\\beta F(q)]. For instance, for a spin system, the control parameter may be an external magnetic field, q=h, and the conjugate variable may be the total magnetization, \\\\Phi = M.  Phase transitions and Lee‚ÄìYang theory  Illustration of how the zeros closest to the real axis (red circles) in the complex plane of the control parameter q may move, with increasing system size N, towards the (real) critical value q^* (filled circle) for which a phase transition takes place in the thermodynamic limit. The partition function and the free energy are intimately linked to phase transitions, for which there is a sudden change in the properties of a physical system. Mathematically, a phase transition occurs when the partition function vanishes and the free energy is singular (non-analytic). For instance, if the first derivative of the free energy with respect to the control parameter is non-continuous, a jump may occur in the average value of the fluctuating conjugate variable, such as the magnetization, corresponding to a first-order phase transition. Importantly, for a finite-size system, Z(q) is a finite sum of exponential functions and is thus always positive for real values of q. Consequently, F(q) is always well-behaved and analytic for finite system sizes. By contrast, in the thermodynamic limit, F(q) may exhibit a non-analytic behavior. Using that Z(q) is an entire function for finite system sizes, Lee‚ÄìYang theory takes advantage of the fact that the partition function can be fully characterized by its zeros in the complex plane of q. These zeros are often known as Lee‚ÄìYang zeros or, in the case of inverse temperature as control parameter, Fisher zeros. The main idea of Lee‚ÄìYang theory is to mathematically study how the positions and the behavior of the zeros change as the system size grows. If the zeros move onto the real axis of the control parameter in the thermodynamic limit, it signals the presence of a phase transition at the corresponding real value of q=q^*. In this way, Lee‚ÄìYang theory establishes a connection between the properties (the zeros) of a partition function for a finite size system and phase transitions that may occur in the thermodynamic limit (where the system size goes to infinity).  Examples = Molecular zipper  The molecular zipper is a toy model which may be used to illustrate the Lee‚ÄìYang theory. It has the advantage that all quantities, including the zeros, can be computed analytically. The model is based on a double-stranded macromolecule with N links that can be either open or closed. For a fully closed zipper, the energy is zero, while for each open link the energy is increased by an amount \\\\varepsilon. A link can only be open if the preceding one is also open. For a number g of different ways that a link can be open, the partition function of a zipper with N links reads :Z = \\\\sum_{n=0}^Ng^n e^{-\\\\beta n \\\\varepsilon} = \\\\frac{1-(ge^{-\\\\beta \\\\varepsilon})^{N+1}}{1-ge^{-\\\\beta \\\\varepsilon}}. This partition function has the complex zeros :\\\\beta_k = \\\\beta_c + \\\\frac{2\\\\pi k}{\\\\varepsilon (N+1)}i, \\\\qquad k \\\\in {-N,...,N}\\\\backslash {0}, where we have introduced the critical inverse temperature \\\\beta_c^{-1} = k_B T_c, with T_c = \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{k_B \\\\log g}. We see that in the limit N\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty, the zeros closest to the real axis approach the critical value \\\\beta_k = \\\\beta_c. For g=1, the critical temperature is infinite and no phase transition takes place for finite temperature. By contrast, for g>1, a phase transition takes place at the finite temperature T_c. To confirm that the system displays a non-analytic behavior in the thermodynamic limit, we consider the free energy :F = U-TS = n(\\\\varepsilon - k_B T \\\\log g), or, equivalently, the dimensionless free energy per link :\\\\frac{F}{N \\\\varepsilon} = \\\\frac{n}{N} (1-T/T_c). In the thermodynamic limit, we obtain :\\\\lim_{N\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}\\\\frac{F}{N\\\\varepsilon} = \\\\lim_{N\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}-\\\\beta^{-1} \\\\log[Z] = \\\\lim_{N\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}-\\\\beta^{-1}\\\\log\\\\left[\\\\frac{1-(ge^{-\\\\beta \\\\varepsilon})^{N+1}}{1-ge^{-\\\\beta \\\\varepsilon}}\\\\right] =\\\\begin{cases} 1-T/T_c, & T > T_c\\\\ 0, & T \\\\leq T_c \\\\end{cases} . Indeed, a cusp develops at T_c in the thermodynamic limit. In this case, the first derivative of the free energy is discontinuous, corresponding to a first-order phase transition.  Ising model  The Ising model is the original model that Lee and Yang studied when they developed their theory on partition function zeros. The Ising model consists of spin lattice with N spins {\\\\sigma_k}, each pointing either up, \\\\sigma_k=+1, or down, \\\\sigma_k=-1. Each spin may also interact with its closest spin neighbors with a strength J_{ij}. In addition, an external magnetic field h>0 may be applied (here we assume that it is uniform and thus independent of the spin indices). The Hamiltonian of the system for a certain spin configuration {\\\\sigma_i} then reads : H({\\\\sigma_i}) = - \\\\sum_{\\\\langle i,j\\\\rangle} J_{ij} \\\\sigma_i \\\\sigma_j - h \\\\sum_j \\\\sigma_j. In this case, the partition function reads :Z({\\\\sigma_i}) = \\\\sum_{{\\\\sigma_i}} e^{-\\\\beta H({\\\\sigma_i})} The zeros of this partition function cannot be determined analytically, thus requiring numerical approaches. = Lee‚ÄìYang theorem = For the ferromagnetic Ising model, for which J_{ij} \\\\geq 0 for all i, j, Lee and Yang showed that all zeros of Z({\\\\sigma_i}) lie on the unit circle in the complex plane of the parameter z\\\\equiv \\\\exp(-2 \\\\beta h). This statement is known as the Lee‚ÄìYang theorem, and has later been generalized to other models, such as the Heisenberg model.  Dynamical phase transitions  A similar approach can be used to study dynamical phase transitions. These transitions are characterized by the Loschmidt amplitude, which plays the analogue role of a partition function.  Connections to fluctuations  The Lee‚ÄìYang zeros may be connected to the cumulants of the conjugate variable \\\\Phi of the control variable q. For brevity, we set \\\\beta = 1 in the following. Using that the partition function is an entire function for a finite-size system, one may expand it in terms of its zeros as :Z(q) = Z(0)e^{cq}\\\\prod_k (1-q/q_k), where Z(0) and c are constants, and q_k is the k:th zero in the complex plane of q. The corresponding free energy then reads :-F(q) = \\\\log[Z(q)] = \\\\log[Z(0)]+cq+\\\\sum_k \\\\log[1-q/q_k]. Differentiating this expression n times with respect to q, yields the n:th order cumulant :\\\\langle !\\\\langle \\\\Phi^n \\\\rangle !\\\\rangle = \\\\partial^n_q [-F(q)] = -\\\\sum_k \\\\frac{(n-1)!}{(q_k-q)^n}, \\\\quad n>1. Furthermore, using that the partition function is a real function, the Lee‚ÄìYang zeros have to come in complex conjugate pairs, allowing us to express the cumulants as :\\\\langle !\\\\langle \\\\Phi^n \\\\rangle !\\\\rangle = -(n-1)!\\\\sum_k \\\\frac{2 \\\\cos(n \\\\arg{q_k-q})}{q_k-q^n}, \\\\quad n>1, where the sum now runs only over each pair of zeros. This establishes a direct connection between cumulants and Lee‚ÄìYang zeros. Moreover, if n is large, the contribution from zeros lying far away from q is strongly suppressed, and only the closest pair q_0 of zeros plays an important role. One may then write :\\\\langle !\\\\langle \\\\Phi^n \\\\rangle !\\\\rangle \\\\simeq -(n-1)!\\\\frac{2 \\\\cos(n \\\\arg{q_0-q})}{q_0-q^n}, \\\\quad n\\\\gg 1. This equation may be solved as a linear system of equations, allowing for the Lee‚ÄìYang zeros to be determined directly from higher-order cumulants of the conjugate variable: :\\\\begin{bmatrix}2 \\\\text{Re}[q-q_0] \\\\ q-q_0 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}1 & -\\\\frac{\\\\kappa^{(+)}_n}{n}\\\\ 1 & -\\\\frac{\\\\kappa^{(+)}_{n+1}}{n+1} \\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} \\\\begin{bmatrix}(n-1) \\\\kappa_n^{(-)} \\\\ n \\\\kappa_{n+1}^{(-)} \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\qquad \\\\kappa^{\\\\pm} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{\\\\langle !\\\\langle \\\\Phi^{n\\\\pm1}\\\\rangle!\\\\rangle}{\\\\langle !\\\\langle \\\\Phi^{n}\\\\rangle!\\\\rangle}.  Experiments  Being complex numbers of a physical variable, Lee‚ÄìYang zeros have traditionally been seen as a purely theoretical tool to describe phase transitions, with little or none connection to experiments. However, in a series of experiments in the 2010s, various kinds of Lee‚ÄìYang zeros have been determined from real measurements. In one experiment in 2015, the Lee‚ÄìYang zeros were extracted experimentally by measuring the quantum coherence of a spin coupled to an Ising-type spin bath. In another experiment in 2017, dynamical Lee‚ÄìYang zeros were extracted from Andreev tunneling processes between a normal-state island and two superconducting leads. Furthermore, in 2018, there was an experiment determining the dynamical Fisher zeros of the Loschmidt amplitude, which may be used to identify dynamical phase transitions.

It is the lowest formation of the Santa Fe Group in the San Diego Mountains area, overlying older volcanic units now assigned to the Spears Group. The formation fills paleovalleys cut in the underlying volcanic beds.Cather et al. 1994 The formation is particularly well exposed in a half graben between the East and West Selden Hills; in Selden Canyon to the west; at its type section in the Tonuco Uplift; and in the Rincon Hills to the north, where it is coarser (including boulder conglomerates) and partially silicified. The formation is interpreted as stream and flood plain deposits near the axis of a broad closed basin. The narrow (12 km) half graben is tilted to the northeast and has its footwall on the Caballo Mountains block, where displacement was about . Study of the formation and others in the area support at least four episodes of block faulting starting 35 million years ago, almost all along faults trending north-south.Mack et al. 1994 The formation records the unroofing of the Caballo Mountains.

Their company was one of the earliest electrical engineering consulting firms in the United States. Stone & Webster's first major project was the construction of a hydroelectric plant for the New England paper company in 1890. Stone & Webster not only had valuable insight into developing and managing utilities but they also had keen intuition for businesses to invest in. Through the panic of 1893, Stone & Webster were able to acquire the Nashville Electric Light and Power Co. for a few thousand dollars and later sold it for $500,000. Throughout the next ten years, Stone & Webster acquired interest in large number of utilities while offering managerial, engineering and financial consulting to a number of independent utility firms. Even though Stone & Webster were not a holding company, their financial and managerial presence meant that they had considerable influence in policy decisions. They would often be paid in utility stock. Stone & Webster became involved in Washington State engineering projects‚ÄîWashington's natural resources, and hydroelectric power, and resulting development opportunities brought companies like Stone & Webster to the state‚Äîbeginning with Puget Sound area street railways. By 1900, they had controlled and merged eight small rail lines in Seattle; soon after, they also took over the street railway systems of Tacoma and Everett. By 1908, Stone & Webster listed thirty-one railway and lighting companies under its management including five located in Washington State: the Puget Sound Electric Railway, Puget Sound International Railway and Power Co., Puget Sound Power Co., The Seattle Electric Co., and Whatcom County Railway and Light Co. Stone & Webster leadership was sensitive to the concerns of large utility holding companies and were careful to emphasize the complete independence of these utilities, but Edwin Webster believed that outside capital was crucial to develop the resources of Washington, and chided those who thought otherwise. In 1905, Stone & Webster bought out the power and lighting properties that were once owned by the Bellingham Bay Improvement Co., including the York Street Steam plant and the partially built Nooksack Falls Hydroelectric Power Plant.Stone & Webster took over construction operations and on September 21, 1906, Bellingham received power from the plant via a transmission line. Despite the independence allowed its subsidiaries, J.D. Ross, superintendent of Seattle City Light issued a report critical of Stone & Webster's presence in Seattle, listing 49 companies under Stone & Webster's management at the time. Electric Vehicles William H. Blood Jr. represented Stone & Webster at the inaugural meeting of the Electric Vehicle Association of America. Restructuring  By 1912, the company, nationally, had divided itself into three specialized subsidiaries: * Stone & Webster Engineering * Stone & Webster Management Association * Stone & Webster Investments Rex Dunbar Frazier (photographer and representative of Stone & Webster Engineering) in camp following 1915 Galveston HurricaneMen relaxing at Stone & Webster Engineering camp at Virginia Point, Texas following 1915 Galveston Hurricane In 1927, Stone & Webster expanded the investments business, merging its securities subsidiaries with the investment banking firm of Blodgett & Co. founded in 1886, to form Stone & Webster and Blodgett Inc. In January, 1946, the name of the business, was changed to Stone and Webster Securities Corporation. Stone and Webster Securities was one of the 17 U.S. investment banking and securities firms named in the United States Department of Justice's antitrust investigation of Wall Street commonly known as the Investment Bankers Case.United States of America, Plaintiff, Against Henry S.

Career Upon completing his MHS Graduate Training Program in Clinical Investigation, Polydefkis joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine as an Associate professor. During his tenure at Johns Hopkins, his research focused on developing novel measures of peripheral nerve disease and sensitive outcome measures for clinical trials. He was the lead author of a study in 2014 which found that patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy have trouble on stairs, which can be aided by exercise. Polydefkis's research also found that \\"epidermal innervation is affected early in diabetes and pre‚Äêdiabetes and that novel measures of regeneration can be used in peripheral neuropathy trials.\\" During his tenure at Johns Hopkins, Polydefkis also specialized in treating hATTR amyloidosis and developed the first effective treatment for transthyretin amyloidosis. He collaborated with Phillip Zamore and his company Alnylam Pharmaceuticals to disperse an experimental drug aimed at silencing the chemical blueprint for protein. As word arose of new approaches to treat this disease, Polydefkis and members of Johns Hopkins faculty aided in completing trials of the drug. In his lab, Polydefkis developed a protocol to test for amyloid using punch skin biopsies which yielded positive results. As a result of his research, Polydefkis received the 2019 Donlin M.

Route description The Concepcion‚ÄìClark Transmission Line went into service in August 24, 2008. Originally commissioned by the government-owned National Transmission Corporation (TransCo), it is now operated and maintained by the privately-owned National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP). Line 1 was energized at 69kV on July 11, 2008 and line 2 on August 24, 2008 and were later uprated to their current voltage of 230kV on December 9 and November 30, 2009, respectively. It passes through the municipalities of Concepcion and Bamban in Tarlac and the city of Mabalacat in Pampanga. From Concepcion Substation until its entry to SCTEx, upon passing through New Clark City exit and Sacobia River, and at its terminus at Clark Substation, the line uses lattice towers. Steel poles, however, are used from its entry to SCTEx until its approach to New Clark City exit and after Sacobia River to Clark North Exit. The transmission line starts at Concepcion Substation, parallels with San Manuel‚ÄìConcepcion‚ÄìMexico transmission line, turns right upon entering Subic‚ÄìClark‚ÄìTarlac Expressway (SCTEx) and run parallel into the said expressway until Clark North Exit. It then intersects with San Manuel‚ÄìConcepcion‚ÄìMexico line before passing through Concepcion Exit. Between Concepcion and New Clark City exits, line 2 of the transmission line passes through Seaoil gas station and CityMall SCTEx while line 1 passes through PTT gas station. Upon approaching New Clark City exit and passing through Sacobia River, the line will utilize the western side of SCTEx. It again utilize both sides of the expressway after passing the said river, continues straightforward, and ends at Clark Substation. Components The transmission line consists of 185 steel poles, 20 lattice towers, and 2 portal towers totaling to 207 structures.

It is now in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 351. The painting was bought in Florence in 1894 by Wilhelm von Bode, and was identified as a Sodoma from the start, although some Fin de si√®cle critics expressed their disregard for what they considered \\"a badly restored work\\" (as it turned out after thorough scientific examination in 1978, the work had in fact not been substantially altered at all). Until the 2010s, Holy Family with Saint John the Baptist and an Angel had been considered as a work from Sodoma's early period, predating his journey to Rome in 1509, but stylistic and iconographic examinations from 2017 have established that it has much more probably been painted in Siena in the second half of the 1530s. The Holy Family with Saint John the Baptist and an Angel is one of Sodoma's multiple variations on the extended theme (Holy Family, Holy Family with John the Baptist, Holy Family with John the Baptist and an angel), and quite characteristic for his style. One original aspect of the Strasbourg version is the unusual posture of the (rather feminine) angel, who appears to hold John the Baptist in a motherly fashion.

Established by the city in the 18th century as a poor farm, the surviving elements of the property include the 1870 Warden's House, and the 1933 infirmary, which continues to serve as an elderly care and nursing facility known as Forestdale Senior Living. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020. Description and history The Malden City Infirmary property is located in northeastern Malden, on the east side of Forest Street at Goodhue Street. The current site is a surviving fragment of the original poor farm, which reached its maximum extent at , and include land on the west side of Forest Street that now includes Forestdale Cemetery. The property includes a two-story wood frame Italianate style house, built in 1870 for the poor farm's warden. Its major feature is the infirmary, a single-story U-shaped brick building constructed in 1933, which is connected to the house by a wood-frame connector. Attached to the other side of the infirmary is a brick sunroom, which was probably built earlier in the 20th century during a flu epidemic. This are was first used for the care of indigent residents in 1772, and it was formally organized as a poor farm and almshouse in 1780. In 1897 its facilities included a house with 25 beds, and 20 acres of surrounding land. In the first half of the 20th century, the property was repeatedly subdivided for a variety of public uses, including the cemetery, public housing, and a school. The use of almshouses declined in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the property was repurposed with the 1933 construction of the infirmary. It was operated by the city as a nursing home for its indigent aging population until 2009. It has since been rehabilitated for use as an assisted living facility.

Clarice married British explorer and author Arthur de Carle Sowerby in Shanghai in 1925, and was managing editor of The China Journal. Nina Moise graduated from Girls' High School in 1908, and like her sisters attended Stanford University, where she was president of the Associated Women Students, and ran for editor of the school's literary monthly, the Sequoia. In 1911, she became the first woman student to address the Stanford student body. She graduated from Stanford in 1912.  Career = Theatre  Moise was an actress who became a theatrical and film director. She was both an actress and director with the Jessie Bonstelle company in Detroit. In 1914, she gave a dramatic reading for the Ebell Club in Los Angeles. In 1917 she was named the first professional director of the Provincetown Players. \\"Tactful handling of temperaments on Nina's part pulled the whole bill through to success,\\" recalled Edna Kenton. She directed seventeen productions, collaborating with playwrights Floyd Dell, Eugene O'Neill, Neith Boyce, and Susan Glaspell, among others, before she left the Provincetown Players in May 1918. Later in 1918, during World War I, she was head of the educational department of the San Francisco chapter of the American Red Cross. In 1921, Moise began as company director of the Santa Barbara Community Arts Players. At Santa Barbara, she directed plays performed at the Lobero Theatre, and actors including Eva Le Gallienne. She also appeared on stage, including in the starring role in Within the Law in 1922, when the scheduled star fell ill. In 1922, she took a six-month leave to study developments in theatre in Europe. In 1924, she spoke at the annual meeting of the Drama League of America, on a panel titled \\"The Non-Professional Theatre\\". She left the Santa Barbara Players in 1926, succeeded by Irving Pichel.  Film  Moise became known as a film director in 1933. She told a newspaper that year, \\"I don't want to be hard-boiled, but it would be convenient right now if I could be.\\" Her film credits included work as assistant to Cecil B. DeMille on This Day and Age (1933), as associate director on Cradle Song (1933), and as a dialogue coach on My Marriage (1936), High Noon (1952), and The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955). She helped performers including Buster Crabbe, Akim Tamiroff, Simone Simon, and Claire Trevor improve their voices or change accents. She also coached the voice actors on Disney films including Snow White (1937) and Pinocchio (1940).  Personal life  Moise may have had a personal relationship with Eugene O'Neill. In 1934 and 1935 she traveled to Shanghai. She died in 1968, aged 78, in Los Angeles, California.

Many buildings along this axis undeniably carry historic importance, some are registered on the Kuyavian- Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage list. Location Located in the northern part of Bydgoszcz, the avenue runs through Bocianowo and Bielawy districts, together with the tram line no. 4 following its path. Chodkiewicza street starts on its western side at the crossing with Gda≈Ñska Street and ends in the east when intercepting the urban portion of the S5 expressway. History Bleichfelder district ca 1905 In the 1870s, the northern extension of Gda≈Ñska Street reached today's intersection with Chodkiewicza street. The area in the east delineated by present day Gda≈Ñska, Krasi≈Ñskiego, Ogi≈Ñski and Chodkiewicza streets was then purchased by municipal authorities. This domain, so-called Hempelscher Felde from the name of a previous landlord, was divided at the end of the 19th century and mapped out to draft streets. The first houses on Chodkiewicza street date back to the beginning of the 20th century, mostly located on the western part of the street, close to the main axis of the city that was (and still is) Gda≈Ñska street. This section comprised low tenement houses with front gardens: one can still appreciate instances of these buildings at Nos. 2,5,4-6 or 8. Before 1920, the eastern section of Chodkiewicza street was situated beyond Bydgoszcz city limits, in the rural commune of Bleichfelde (). In the early 20th century, the avenue was the main street of the village, concentrating the majority of the existing buildings. In June 13, 1890, German railway officials found Beamten - Wohnungsverein GmbH (Official Housing Association), a global housing cooperative. In 1902, the Bromberg seat, ancestor of today's Bydgoszcz Housing Cooperative () used loans from the Prussian government to build in a -area, north of Bleichfelder Strasse (previous name of Chodkiewicza), a real estate project of two-story, single-family brick houses called Villen Kolonie. The ensemble was completed in two years and caused a serious crisis on the real estate market of Bromberg center: as a result, the city refused to connect the Villenkolonie Bleichfelde to the municipal water supply and energy infrastructure until 1920. Several factories set up along the northern side of then Bleichfelder Weg during the end of the Prussian period (1900-1920): * a municipal brick factory (at 8/16 Bleichfelder), active from the 1910s to the outset of WW II; * Hermann Boettcher factory of metalwork and steel structures (at 17/18 Bleichfelder Weg), from the 1890s till the 1910s; * Ludwig Kolwitz industries of metal and steel, from 1905 (at 19/21 Bleichfelder). Kolwitz expanded the premises by purchasing the abutting Boetcher warehouse at the beginning of WWI; * Agriculture union warehouse (at 1/2 Kurf√ºrsten stra√üe). Factories at Bleichfelde (1914): bricks workshop (1) - Boetcher's (2) - Kolwitz's (3) - Agriculture union (4) Most of these facilities were linked to the city railway network, using a branch (now gone) extending to southern urban facilities, such as the city gasworks and the city slaughterhouse. After 1945, a tramway line is created, running from the main train station to Bielawy district. Its path, still active, follows Chodkiewicza street, including the end-of-line loop. Since 2010, several investments have been realized nearby: * a project for the new building of the Bydgoszcz Music Academy, at 9-11 Chodkiewicza; * new residential ensemble are planned to replace disused 19th centuty factories, e.g. Botaniq at 19 Chodkiewicza, Sens at 9-11 Chodkiewicza or City Park, completed in 2019 at 19 Chodkiewicza. In 2016, the street underwent a major refurbishment involving the removal of many old chestnut trees. For a long time, the axis consisted of two separate streets, divided by today's Ogi≈Ñski street, which marked city limits until 1920. Hence the avenue bore two distinctive names, until the Second World War when both sections were merged into one street, Albrecht D√ºrer stra√üe. After 1945, a resolution of the Municipal National Council (No. VIII/45) endorsed the path to carry a unique name. However, until 1945, Chodkiewicza street bore the following names: * In the late 19th century, the street was considered as a continuation of the Sedan Stra√üe in the west of Danzigersta√üe; * Beginning 20th century, Bleichfelder Weg (Bleachfield street) (in Bromberg) / Hauptweg (Main street) (out of Bromberg); * 1906 to 1920, Bleichfelder Weg (in Bromberg) / Kurf√ºrsten stra√üe (Electors street) (out of Bromberg); * 1920-1933, Ulica Chodkiewicza (west) / ulica Senatorska (east); * 1933-1939, Ulica Chodkiewicza (west) / ulica Bronis≈Çawa Pierackiego (east); * 1939-1945, Albrecht D√ºrer stra√üe; * Since 1945, ulica Chodkiewicza. Current naming refers to Jan Karol Chodkiewicz (1561‚Äì1621), a military commander of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth army, Field Hetman of Lithuania, Grand Hetman of Lithuania and one of the most prominent noblemen and military commanders of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth of his time.

He lived there till the outbreak of WWII. in 1915, one of the tenants was Major General von Kundel, commanding one the Brigade in Bromberg. The house, though damaged, exhibits landhaus style, altered by early modern architecture: * vertical plastered lines close the openings; * a corner bay window is topped by a simile-roof; * the roofing is marked by a 4-part gambrel roof.

The first owner was August Hempel who lived at 6 Peterson stra√üe (today's Obro≈Ñc√≥w Bydgoszczy street). At the time, one of the tenant was the director of the abutting municipal brick factory (dismantled after the second world war). The villa, renovated in 2019, displays nice characteristics of late Art nouveau-early modern architecture. One can appreciate inside painted wallpapers characteristic for Bydgoszcz and a staircase adorned with mosaic. Outside, one can highlight the original metal and woodworking on the facade, as well as the preserved bartizan.

Erich Lindenburger designed the villa as a different version of the one at No.4: a larger gambrel roof, a small bow window on the ground floor and still some late-Art Nouveau/early modern architecture features. Chodkiewicza 6.jpgthumbVilla at No.6  Tenement at No.7  Beginning of the 20th century Art Nouveau The plot owned by Albert Jahnke, a merchand, has been \\"under construction\\" for several years at the turn of the 20th century. In the late 1900s, Albert Jahnke has the edifice erected and put for rental. In the following years, the tenement moved under the property of Ludwig Kolwitz, the entrepreneur of the neighbouring metalwork industry. From 1909 on, the building housed Hermann Boetcher, also owner of a neighbouring metalwork industry. More recently, the local seat of the Alliance fran√ßaise moved in the tenement. One can underlight in this large edifice the hip roofing, a corner bay window garnished with a stylized mascaron together with a vegetal stuccoed motif on top of one of the facades. File:Chodkiewicza 7.jpgView of the tenement from the street  Villa at No.8  1911, by Alfred Schleusener Late Art nouveau-early modern architecture The commissioner of the villa was Rudolf Kaufmann, a merchand. In the middle of the 1930s, one of the tenant was Jan Montowski, a gynecology surgeon at the Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Bydgoszcz (then called Szpital ≈öw. Floriana Zgromadzenia Si√≥str Mi≈Çosierdzia ≈õw. Wincentego a Paulo) on ≈öwiƒôtego Floriana street. Jan Montowski soon became the director of the hospital before the war. Arrested by the Gestapo, he died in an unknown place and was pronounced dead on September 30, 1939. During WWII, the house was occupied by the Gestapo. In 1945, it was taken over by the NKVD and then by the Ministry of Public Security, better known as UB. This office arranged there a Police departement for children in the end of the 1970s, which closed in 2010. In January 2017, the city authorities decided to sell the facility: however, the case is still to be decided by the court since the owners opposed the municipal decision. The site has been entered in the city register of monuments. The villa is in a bad state, waiting to be taken over by official proprietors. Alfred Schleusener designed a house with Art Nouveau hints (round corners roof, light stucco on facade pilars), but his mind was well oriented towards the then nascient trend of modern architecture.

Kolwitz developped his activity along the street with large warehouses extending north of the avenue. Kolwitz industry operated till the outset of WWII. After 1945, only two buildings remain: those are still standing today. In the backyard of the premises, a real estate project is developped for a completion in 2020.

The German organization Deutscher Schulverein had purchased the plot in 1928, but the municipal authorities were more than reserved on this project of a Albrecht Duerer Schule in Bydgoszcz, thus delaying the issue of the building permit. At the time, it was the largest German school in Poland and started its activity in September 1938, gathering all German educational institutions scattered around the city. It covered education classes from elementary school to gymnasium and comprised a large sport hall. Since 1990, these buildings make up the back bone of the Kazimierz Wielki University. The ensemble on Chodkiewicza street is known as Collegium Maius (Main campus). The buildings harbours the following bodies: * Rector's Office; * Admissions Office; * Teaching Department; * Student Affairs Department; * Main Library; * Physical Education and Sport College; * Vocational Training Centre; * Foreign Language Centre; * Faculties of Pedagogy and Psychology, Mathematics, Physics and Technology and Life Sciences.

In 1905, the shelter for old people's was closed, while the clinic reached a 60-bed capacity. During WWI, the institution treated wounded German soldiers. In the interwar period, the hospital mainly handled patients from outside Bydgoszcz and a adjoined chapel was built. In 1930, the hospital had 120 beds assigned to four departments (surgery, internal medicine, infectious diseases and eye care). Three years later a thorough modernization was performed: the expansion project was designed by Jan Kossowski and unveiled on December 30, 1933. In 1938, the district sold the hospital to the city of Bydgoszcz: it was then subordinated to the newly University Hospital No. 1 - Antoni Jurasz. German occupation had the facility devoted to child care, as a municipal hospital with infection, ENT, ophthalmology and orthopedics departments.. After the liberation, this function as a children's hospital remained. In 1953, the institution was renamed Provincial Children's Hospital - J√≥zef Brudzi≈Ñski. It offered residential, specialised and outpatient care for children and young people from Bydgoszcz and its province. In 1964, a new laboratory building and lodgings for nurses were built. In 1980, the extension of the University Hospital No.1 made the chair of Children's Diseases of Bydgoszcz Medical Academy to be moved to the children's hospital, where it still seats. In 1999, the 10-departments facility passed under the jurisdiction of the Kuyavian- Pomeranian Voivodeship. In 2011-2014, the hospital was significantly rebuilt, which included tearing down existing buildings and erecting new ones from scratch.

He committed suicide on April 26th 2013 shortly after selling the shelter due to bankruptcy and ridicule.  Biography  Silverman, originally from Montreal, moved to Calgary in 1978. He fled his violent and abusive wife in the 1990s, but was unable to find a domestic abuse shelter that could take him in, and would face ridicule at the hands of the police. While plenty of shelters for women existed, the only publicly funded services available for men were for anger management. ‚ÄúAs a victim, I was re-victimized by having these services telling me that I wasn‚Äôt a victim, but I was a perpetrator,‚Äù Silverman told the National Post. After leaving his home, Silverman had spiraled into self-abuse and alcoholism.  Family of Men Society  Silverman founded the Family of Men support society. The organization maintained a telephone crisis line for over a decade to assist men in matters of abuse.  Men‚Äôs Alternative Safe House  Men‚Äôs Alternative Safe House was started in 2010, in Earl's own house in Calgary, making it the only privately funded shelter for male victims of domestic abuse in Canada. MASH hosted about 20 fleeing men and children in 2013 before being shut down. With no public funds to help, Silverman funded the running costs and bills himself, failing to raise significant amounts from either government or private donations. In early 2013, Silverman announced that the sanctuary will be closing because he could no longer afford to run it due to a lack of funding. He sold the house shortly after to a man named Steven Howitt, and committed suicide the next day.  Death  Silverman was found dead by hanging in his garage on April 26th, 2013, in an apparent suicide. His body was discovered by Howitt, who called for help but was unable to save him. Earl left a four-page suicide note, condemning the government for failing to recognize male victims of domestic abuse. Financial ruin and ridicule was said to have contributed to his suicide.  Legacy  Silverman's will directed that the funds from his estate should be dispersed so as to create an 'educational scholarship for male victims of female perpetrated domestic violence.' The superior court of Alberta directed that the funds should be directed to the Mount Royal University Foundation for this purpose. Erin Pizzey, writer and founder of Refuge, said Silverman 'was a martyr to the indifference of the Canadian Government, and we will never forget his name,' and noted that she worried there will be no change in the 'stone-hearted' Canadian government Men's Rights publication A Voice for Men penned Silverman‚Äôs legacy as 'one of providing shelter and help to human beings that the rest of out society is content to see abused, homeless, and disregarded to their deaths.'

The moderate strike-slip shock took place in the Imperial Valley of Southern California, just north of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border in the United States. No injuries or deaths occurred, but damage was estimated at $1‚Äì3 million. With a Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong), this was one of fifteen intensity VII or greater shocks in the Imperial Valley that were observed in the 20th century up until April 1981. The region experiences large stand-alone events and earthquake swarms due to its position in an area of complex conditions where faulting transitions from strike-slip movement to the north and divergence to the south. Preface The Imperial Valley of Southern California is very active seismically and has been subject to numerous destructive earthquakes since communities began to form in this desert area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Records of events prior to this period do not exist due to a lack of settlers in the area. Fifteen shocks of intensity VII or higher were recorded prior to April 1981 and beginning with the intensity VIII shock of April 18, 1906, which was a triggered event following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Tectonic setting The Gulf of California Rift Zone underlies the Gulf of California from the mouth of the Colorado River in Baja California and stretching to the southeast. It contains numerous right-lateral transform faults and rift zones that make up the Pacific‚ÄìNorth American plate boundary. The southern portion has matured into seafloor spreading, and at the northern end of the province is the Salton Trough, which is considered to be an onshore spreading center. The rift zone is covered by thick layers of sediment from the Colorado River drainage basin. Earthquake The Global Centroid Moment Tensor Database shows a NNW strike on a nearly vertical fault, with a rake angle that is within 25 degrees of being pure strike-slip. Intensity The maximum observed intensity for the event was VII (Very strong).

The name derrives from the nickname of the founder, Gustaw R√≥≈ºycki, whilst he was a student at the University of Leoben. History In 1933, mining engineer Gustaw R√≥≈ºycki bought a small mining machinery factory in Za≈Çƒô≈ºe, Katowice from Alfred Wagner and renamed it Fabryka Maszyn Oraz Odlewnia ≈ªelaza i Metali MOJ. He set about expanding the company and by the time WWII broke out the number of employees had risen from 15 to 800. The company produced mining equipment, boat engines, chain saws and other machinery. R√≥≈ºycki was a motorcyle enthusiast and wanted to produce his own machines. In 1935 he employed engineer Karol Zuber to head a new motorcycle division. The first motorcycle, the MOJ 130, was produced later that year. It had a 128 cc two-stroke engine. A 250 cc machine was in development, and there were plans to produce cars. Land had been brought in Sandomierz to build a second factory for car production. Car production was due to start in 1940/1 but the war brought an end to this plan. A rotary engine was in development and R√≥≈ºycki was granted a patent for the design. Following the German invasion of Poland, the factory was commandeered by the Germans to produce mining equipment and ammunition, although a small number of motorcycles were manufactured for military use. R√≥≈ºycki joined the resistance and as a result spent the rest of the war in concentration camps in Dachau and Gusen. After the end of WWII, the factory was nationalised and it was decided not to re-establish motorcycle production. Models=MOJ 130 The motorcycle was modelled on German motorcycles of the time, with an emphasis on quality. Prototype models were fitted with a Villiers engine, but production models used their own 128 cc single cylinder two-stroke engine. A rigid duplex frame was used with pressed steel girder forks. Most components were made by the factory or were from Polish manufacturers. The motorcycle was presented to the press in February 1937 and production machines were available in August of that year. In 1938 the engine was improved with dual exhausts exiting the cylinder at the rear and the carburettor moved to the side of the engine. The gearchange was changed from hand to foot operated. Some machines were purchased by the military, including the 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade. There was also a state-funded purchase scheme for officers to buy the motorcycle. A few competition versions of the model were made and on which R√≥≈ºycki entered various events, including the 1939 Tatra Rally, which he won. Around 600 units of the MOJ 130 were produced pre-war.

Biography Oliver was born in Bloemfontein and raised in Gardens, Cape Town. He attended a Catholic boarding school and after school started a job as a clerk for Old Mutual in Pinelands. He had a number of jobs in human resources and started managing an environmental education NGO. From a young age, he worked as a volunteer for the Progressive Party and later the Progressive Federal Party. Oliver became a part time city councillor in the Cape Town municipality during 1976 and was elected deputy mayor in 1987. At the time, the mayor and deputy mayor offices were ceremonial, with no executive powers and both offices were only for a two-year period. Oliver became mayor on 8 September 1989. Five days after his inauguration as mayor, Oliver along with religious leaders such as Desmond Tutu, Frank Chikane, Farid Esack and Allan Boesak, led a peace march in Cape Town in defiance of the State of Emergency which banned political protests and apartheid laws which enforced racial segregation. That protest march was the first of the two major highlights of Oliver‚Äôs mayoral term. The second was welcoming Nelson Mandela to the Cape Town City Hall to address the South African nation and the world on 11 February 1990, the day of his release from prison. After completing his two years as mayor, Oliver worked as head of Cape Town Tourism (Captour) for about eight years. He left Captour in 1998 and was offered a position to organise an international conference for the Parliament of World Religions, which took place in 1999. When the Cape Town's Unitarian minister died in 1997, Oliver became the congregation's unofficial minister as a volunteer, and in 2000 the church hired him as minister in training. He studied in England and at the University of South Africa and was officially recognized as a minister in 2002 by the British General Assembly. He worked in the Cape Town ministry until 2008 and also obtained a master's degree in religious studies.

He had two brothers and three sisters. To help support the family, Rubin left school to become a carpenter‚Äôs apprentice. In his free time, he sculpted in wood. In 1903, urged by Boris Schatz, a family friend and the \\"father of Israeli art\\", he began studying painting and sculpture at the National Academy of Arts in Sofia.Albert Rubin biography When Theodor Herzl visited Sofia, Rubin was commissioned to paint his portrait. In 1905, the Seventh Zionist Congress in Basel reached a decision to establish an art school in Palestine. A group of thirty young artists from all over Europe were to be selected to form the first class.

He was buried in Cimetiere parisien de Bagneux in a family plot beside his father. His daughter Sylvia Chetrit immigrated to Israel in 1969. Art career In early 1906, Rubin and his family arrived to Jerusalem. He began his studies in Bezalel Art School on March 1, 1906. He was placed in an advanced class. Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, the initiator of the revival of the Hebrew language in the modern era, was hired to teach the students Hebrew. Among his teachers were Ephraim Moses Lilien and Samuel Hirszenberg. He painted and sculpted the landscapes of the land of Israel, especially the ones of Jerusalem. Several of his sculptures remained at Bezalel, among them two busts of children for which he used his younger brothers as models. In the fall of 1909, he left for Paris to continue his art education. To make ends meet he sold all the paintings he had brought with him and began to work as a street artist, creating sidewalk drawings in chalk. He was accepted at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris and received a scholarship, thanks to the intervention of Baron Rothschild. One of his first teachers was Fernand Cormon. He was a candidate for the Prix de Rome, but turned out to be ineligible because he was not a French citizen. He was invited to join the staff of Athenee de France, a respected art magazine, after exhibiting his dual portrait of Sheikh Abu-Nadra (pen name of Yaqub Sanu, an Egyptian Jewish playwright and journalist). After serving in the French army in World War I, he received French citizenship. He was accepted to the Societe des Artistes Francais in 1914. From then on, he exhibited his work at its annual exhibition, Salon des Artistes Francais, and was lauded in the newspapers for his pastels and oils.

In a treatment of pictures in children's books, Tordis √òrjas√¶ter says that Bj√∏rklid's illustrations bear inspiration from Norwegian folklore art. His animals are exaggerated, similar to a child's fantasy. The colors are intense, and figures seem to step directly out of the fairytale. His picture books earned him the from the Ministry of Culture in 1969 and 1973. As painter, he is represented with works in the National Gallery of Norway. He also created animation films for NRK television. Bj√∏rklid died in Oslo in January 2020.

The formation is divided into three informal members These are a lower conglomerate member, a middle tuffaceous member, and an upper volcaniclastic member. The lower member is a sandy or silty conglomerate containing mostly Hondo Group quartzite clasts ranging in size from to over in diameter. The conglomerate is greenish to pale yellow in color poorly sorted, and moderately to well rounded. Ar-Ar geochronology indicates an age range from before 34.5 Ma to less than 28.3 Ma. The middle member is a tuffaceous fine to pebbly sandstone. This is buff to yellowish in color, generally poorly cemented, and poorly sorted. However, some beds are highly silicified. The member contains some well-developed fining upwards sequences a few to tens of centimeters thick. There are some interbeds and channel fills of conglomerate containing local Precambrian clasts, with more conglomerate towards the top. Some ash layers are bioturbated. Ash beds from the Amalia Tuff eruption have been identified within the member, with ages of 23 and 27 Ma, interpreted as pre- and post-caldera pumies.. This member is at least thick. Based on Ar-Ar geochronology, this member was deposited from 28.3 to less than 23 Ma. The upper member is red to purple volcaniclastic conglomerate and sandstone, typically carbonate cemented. Individual bed contacts are abrupt and the lower bed is often scoured. A basalt clast from the base of the member has an age of 19.78 +/- 0.24 Ma, and the member as a whole spans the age range of less than 19.8 Ma to about 15 Ma. This member is overlain by the Dixon Member of the Tesuque Formation. Cabot included tuffaceous beds just north of Santa Fe in the Picuris Formation, but the correlation of this Bishop's Lodge Member remains controversial, with some geologists keeping it with the Picuris Fornmation,Galusha and Blick 1971, others assigning it to the Tesuque Formation,Baldwin 1956, and others more recently assigning it to the Espinaso Formation.Read et al. 2013 The formation is of unusual interest in that it spans the transition from Laramide crustal shortening to Rio Grande rift crustal extension. History of investigation The formation was first named by E.C. Cabot in 1938, likely for exposures in the Picuris Mountains north of Vadito, New Mexico.

Life Knatchnull was born in 1584. Her parents were Ann Elizabeth (born Crispe) and Reginald Knatchbull of Saltwood Castle. In 1604 she joined the English Benedictine convent in Brussels in 1604 and was professed seven years later when she was given the religious name of Lucy. She would write of the anguish she felt at the commitment she had made but in time she took the idea of being a nun joyously. By 1624 she felt crowded at the convent in Brussels and she was given leave to go to Ghent with three other nuns to establish a small convent there. The four nuns were Knatchbull, Magdalen Digby, Eugenia Poulton, Dame Mary Roper. Two of the early nuns were her nieces Mary and Margaret Knatchbull. Within a year they had twenty postulants and the dowries that these recruits bought to the convent. With these funds Knatchnull was able to commission a new building on the banks of the River Scheldt which they moved to in 1628. After the Civil War broke out in 1640, the Catholic convert Tobie Matthew was falsely accused. Matthew, by now in his sixties, left England in 1641. He took refuge with the English Jesuits at their house at Ghent. Whilst he was there he became the spiritual adviser to Knatchbull. He admired her and wrote her biography, The life of Lady Lucy Knatchbull, that was first published in 1931. Death and legacy Knatchbull died in Ghent on 5 August 1629. In 1650 Knatchbull's niece Mary was elected Abbess. The Ghent community had to flee to the UK in 1794 and they initially settled in Preston, moving to Caverswall Castle and then to Oulton in 1853 where it continues.

Environmental policies are transnational when they include actors from at least two sovereign states. As of 2018, more than 1,800 multilateral environmental agreements are in effect.  History  Since World War II, environmental policies have shifted focus from local or discrete issues like loss of biodiversity or pollution to global environmental topics. The post-war economic expansion also created environmental damage, which in turn led to modern environmentalism and the first Earth Day in 1970. The 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm marked \\"the emergence of what has become a large and complex set of environmental regimes\\", and \\"the beginning of international environmental law and policy.\\" Major conferences regarding climate change occurred in the 1970s and 1980s, with the first World Climate Conference in 1979, and the World Conference on the Changing Atmosphere in 1988; the latter resulted in the world's first ambitious targets and timetables for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. As of 2018, more than 1,800 multilateral environmental agreements are in effect. Of these, more than 190 address climate change, consisting of 12,000 sub-state and non-state actors.  Actors = International organizations  International organizations are organizations established by treaties, which are governed by international law and have their own legal personalities. They both create international law and are subject to it. Examples of international organizations with a focus in environmental policy include the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the United Nations Environment Programme.  Non-governmental organizations (NGOs)  Transnational environmental NGOs (TENGOs) are environmental NGOs with a broad geographic scope. Examples of TENGOs include World Wide Fund for Nature, Natural Resources Defense Council, Conservation International, The Nature Conservancy, and the World Resources Institute. One way TENGOs create environmental change is through market-based certification programs, which have been enacted in sectors including ecotourism, forestry, fishing, and fair trade. One of the most successful and visible of these programs is the Forest Stewardship Council, which has served as a model for other certification programs. Other popular certification programs include the dolphin safe label and Marine Stewardship Council.

From 1988 to 1992, Mortimer served as the president of the Bibliographical Society of America, the first woman to inhabit the role.  Early life and education  Ruth Mortimer was born on September 16, 1931 in Syracuse, New York, to Donald Cameron Mortimer and Lillian Ruth Burk The family moved to Rochester, New York before Mortimer entered school. As a first year at Smith College in 1949, Mortimer worked as an assistant in the Rare Books Collection, which was then under the curatorship of Dorothy King. Mortimer graduated summa cum laude from Smith in 1953. During her first three summers at Smith, Mortimer worked as a proofreader for the Lawyers' Co- operative Publishing Company in Rochester. After Smith, Mortimer worked for a year as a pre-professional librarian at the Brooklyn Public Library; during this time, she also took courses in French at the Columbia University School of General Studies. In 1954, Mortimer started study at the Columbia University School of Library Service. For financial support, she worked as an Assistant in Serials at the Smith College Library and also ead papers for two courses there. She received her M.S. from Columbia in 1957. Mortimer also earned a certificate at the Shakespeare Institute of the University of Birmingham, England, in 1955.  Career  From 1957 to 1975, Mortimer worked at Harvard's Houghton Library. While there, in 1964, she produced two catalogues of the institution's 16th Century French and Italian books, the first of which was chosen by the American Institute of Graphic Arts as one of the Fifty Books of the Year for that year. These books are considered \\"standard reference works in the field,\\" notes The New York Times, and were \\"a monument of good typography [and] their author's learning and industry\\" according to the Independent. In these catalogues Mortimer showcased a breadth of knowledge on illustrators and placed specific focus on the visual artistry of the books within. In 1975, she returned to Smith College as curator of the Rare Books Collection. In addition to her curatorial duties, Mortimer gave lectures on art history and taught a seminar on book composition. The Rare Book Collection grew exponentially under Mortimer's curatorship: in 1981 and 1986 (respectively), she oversaw the acquisition of Smith's lauded Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf collections. Mortimer was also responsible for Smith's 1976 acquisition of a three-volume original edition of Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein.\\" Mortimer herself was fascinated with Frankenstein and collected editions of the novel and ephemera related to the novel, which now resides at Smith. Mortimer also oversaw the Smith College library's one- millionth volume purchase, the Epistole devotissime of St. Catherine of Siena. Mortimer was the first woman elected to serve as president of the Bibliographical Society of America, a position she held from 1988 to 1992. Between 1981 and 1988, Mortimer, in collaboration with her husband, edited the BSA's quarterly journal, Papers.

Biography Hermann Aubin was born in Reichenberg, Austria on 23 December 1885. His father was a wealthy factory owner. The Aubin family were descended from French Huguenots who had settled in Frankfurt in the 16th century AD. Aubin graduated at the top of his class from the gymnasium at Reichenberg in July 1904, and subsequently volunteered for a year as a soldier in the Austro- Hungarian Army. Since 1905, Aubin studied history and economics at the universities of Munich and Freiburg. He gained a PhD at Freiburg in 1910 under the supervision of Georg von Below. After gaining his PhD, Aubin lectured on history in D√ºsseldorf. During World War I, Aubin served as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army on a variety of fronts. He gained his habilitation in 1916 under the supervision of Aloys Schulte. With the dismemberment of Austria-Hungary, Aubin became a German citizen. From 1920 onwards, Aubin taught history in Bonn. Aubin was hit hard economically by the hyperinflation of the 1920s, and the poor economic situation in Germany prevented him from gaining a full professorship. During this time, Aubin contemplated leaving the history profession. In 1925, he was appointed a lecturer at the University of Giessen. In 1929 he was appointed a Professor of History at the University of Breslau. At the end of World War II, Aubin was drafted into the Volksturm and fought in the Siege of Breslau. In 1946, Aubin was appointed Professor of Medieval and Modern History at the University of Hamburg. From 1955, he was Honorary Professor of History at the University of Freiburg. After the war, Aubin founded and led a number of scholarly organizations. He was the Editor of Zeitschrift f√ºr Ostmitteleuropa-Forschung from 1952 to 1966. Aubin played a leading role in shaping the field of history in West Germany. On his 70th birthday in December 1955, Aubin received the Grand Cross with Star and Sash of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. He died in Freiburg 11 March 1969.

The term often carries negative connotations. In Israel it's been used in discourse about the possible impact of Mizrahi or non-European Jews on Israeli culture. In other contexts, the term has sometimes been used in an anti-Islamic context for the perceived \\"cultural contamination\\" of European values by \\"degenerate Levantine influences\\". Srinivas Aravamudan describes it as \\"a strategic deformation of orientalism's representational mechanisms\\". Aravamudan writes that \\"levantinizations indicate that agency can be found in a number of guises and forms, sometimes within orientalism itself\\". Constantinople Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's Letters from the Levant were written to well known persons of historical note like Lady Mar, Abb√© Conti and Alexander Pope while her husband served as ambassador to Constantinople in the early 18th century. Her letters were first published in 1763. Scholars have argued that Montagu complicates the concepts of \\"Eurocentrism and authoritarianism\\" emphasized by Edward Said, as challenges the binary conception of Eastern and Western cultures. Aravamudan argues that Montagu's levantinization, as he calls it, \\"demonstrates the ambivalence and the malleability of orientalist topologies\\". According to Aravamudan's analysis of the letters, Montagu writes from \\"a secular anthropologizing stance towards cultures\\", which he says is a feature of post-Renaissance values that take in stride the \\"arbitrary norms that undergird cultural meaning and identity\\". Aravamudan says this viewpoint from which Montagu composed her letters \\"replaces the existing bias of a simple ethnocentricism in favor of the observer's culture with an eclectic relativism\\". Arvamudan believes that underlying this is the author's own feeling of being alienated from their home culture. Israel As early as the mid-1930s fears of a loss of Jewish character had given way to a campaign against the so-called Levantinization of Tel Aviv. At the 25th anniversary of the city's founding in 1934 Hayyim Nahman Bialik said \\"A great danger faces our Tel Aviv, that it will become a levantine city, like other coastal cities.\\" That same year Meir Dizengoff said \\"it develops into a noisy city, a wild levantine city, as if its residents were not the great-grandchildren of the ancestors whose feet stood on Mount Sinai and as if the Tel Avivan public is not entirely Jewish and civilized\\". Not all residents shared these concerns, some citing the examples of Berlin and Warsaw, European cities where anti-Semitism had thrived, as poor examples to follow. For the Ashkenazim the term Levantinization represented some cultural traits that were seen as threatening to the idea of Western modernity and by extension the core values of Israeli society. These included speaking Yiddish, wearing traditional clothing and certain types of religious thought. The Shinui party, founded by Josef Lapid, who has been described as \\"Eurocentric, chauvinistic and anti- Mizarahi\\", viewed Levantinization as a threat to the existence of the state of Israel, along with the Haredim, Palestinians, and similar cultural influences of Russification and Orientalization. Lapid has said: > Levantiniut is a thin layer of European varnish spread over Mizarahi > decadence. And under the Levantine tranquility, the lava of Arab nationalism > and Islamic fundamentalism is simmering. We don't have anything to look for > in this culture and we have no reason to yearn for it. Israel exists thanks > to her being a western state, a state of high tech, a country that has > adapted itself to the values of European culture and the concepts of Anglo > Saxon democracy which are the total contrast to Levantine contamination. Baruch Kimmerling wrote: > The mass immigration of non-European Jews had the potential to fundamentally > change the system through 'Levantinization', and, from the perspective of > the European veterans, to downgrade it to the 'low quality' of the > surrounding Arab states and societies. In stereotypical terms, these > immigrants were perceived as possessing a certain premodern biblical Jewish > authenticity, although at the same time seen as aggressive, alcoholic, > cunning, immoral, lazy, noisy, and unhygienic. Egyptian-Israeli novelist Jacqueline Kahanoff has described herself as a \\"typical Levantine in that I appreciate equally what I inherited from my Oriental origins and what is now mine of Western culture\\". Kahanoff says that she finds the cultural cross fertilization \\"an enrichment and not an impoverishment\\", despite the negative label of \\"Levantinization\\" attached to the phenomenon in Israel.

Traditional Vanyume territory extended along the Mojave River from the Eastern Mojave Desert to present day Victorville and may have included portions of southern Antelope Valley. Though the Vanyume were closely related to the neighboring Serrano people linguistically and culturally, the two groups were politically distinct prior to European contact. Because all documented Vanyume villages had been abandoned prior to the development of modern ethnographic fieldwork, ethnographic information on the Vanyume is limited.  Name  The first European to mention the Vanyume, Father Francisco Garc√©s, referred to the group using the Mohave exonym Be√±em√©. Vanyum√©, a variation of the term, was later adopted by ethnographer Alfred Louis Kroeber.  Pre-Contact = Population  A. L. Kroeber described the Vanyume population as \\"very small\\" at the time of European contact. A 2017 analysis found that the group could have comprised as many as 700 people at the time of contact.  Language  The Vanyume traditionally spoke the Vanyume language, a now-extict Uto-Aztecan language belonging to the Takic branch. The Vanyume language was likely very closely related to the Serrano language, though it may have shared features with the neighboring Kitanemuk language.  Population decline  Between the late 18th and early 20th centuries, the Vanyume population dramatically declined.  Missionization  Beginning in 1790, a number of Vanyume people were baptized at Mission San Fernando and Mission San Gabriel. The period between 1811 and 1814 saw the most rapid missionization, a process likely aided through military intimidation. A 1811 effort may have attempted to forcefully round up and relocate the Vanyume and Serrano. Compared to their upriver counterparts, Vanyume villages on the lower Mojave river enjoyed relative freedom from Spanish influence and missionization. In late 1810s, a number of Vanyume settlements were depopulated and their residents killed by warring Spanish and Mohave people.  Other factors  Indigenous Californians interivewed by ethnographers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries describe incidents of trade-related violence with the Mohave as a key factor in the decline and dispersion of Vanyume populations. These conflicts likely occurred around the 1830s. A number of living individuals are of Vanyume ancestry.

The network primarily broadcasts theatrically released motion pictures and original television programs as well as made-for-cable movies, documentaries, and occasional stand-up comedy and concert specials. HBO does not accept traditional advertising, although it typically airs programming promotions between shows; it also presents content without editing for profanity, violence, sexual depictions, nudity, drug use or other subjectively objectionable material, which‚Äîbesides being able to depict mature subject matter usually not allowed to air on advertiser- supported television networks‚Äîhas allowed the network to give program creators full creative autonomy over their projects. The oldest and longest continuously operating subscription television service in the United States, Home Box Office pioneered modern pay television when it launched as a microwave-transmitted regional service on November 8, 1972, and was a leader in the development and growth of the cable television industry as the first television service to be directly transmitted and distributed to individual cable systems; the first television channel in the world to begin transmitting its signal via communications satellite; the first pay television network to operate a standalone companion service (Take 2, now defunct; followed later by Cinemax and the now-defunct Festival); the first cable-originated network to win Emmy, Golden Globe and Peabody Awards; and one of the first two American pay television services (alongside Cinemax) to offer multiplexed channels complimentary to the parent service. HBO has since expanded to include seven multiplex channels in the United States; and, through its namesake parent subsidiary, twelve active and three defunct international services (either owned by WarnerMedia directly or through programming and brand licensing agreements with domestic media companies) across four continents, and various television, film and home entertainment ventures. This article details the history of HBO tracing to its founding by Sterling Communications (then controlled by Time Inc.) in July 1971, and its operational history from the channel's November 1972 launch to its current ownership by WarnerMedia. Background and development (pre-1972) HBO's origins trace to December 1, 1965, when Charles Dolan‚Äîwho had already done pioneering work in the commercial use of cables‚Äîwas granted a franchise permit by the New York City Council to build a cable television system encompassing the Lower Manhattan section of New York City (traversing southward from 79th Street on the Upper East Side to 86th Street on the Upper West Side). Dolan was one of three applicants to be awarded cable franchise permits by the City of New York on that date, joined by TelePrompTer Corporation (which was assigned most of Upper Manhattan) and CATV Enterprises Inc. (which was assigned to a portion of the city's Upper West Side, extending north of the Harlem River, and The Bronx's Riverdale neighborhood). Dolan's maiden television venture was Teleguide, a closed-circuit television system he started in June 1962, distributing a schedule of tourist information, news, interview segments and feature interstitials to hotels, and by 1964, apartment buildings and office buildings in the New York metropolitan area. Through Dolan's company, Sterling Information Services (operated by Teleguide parent Sterling Movies U.S.A.), Manhattan Cable TV Services began limited cable service in September 1966. Manhattan Cable (renamed Sterling Manhattan Cable Television in January 1971) was the first urban underground cable television system to operate in the United States. Rather than string up cable on telephone poles or use microwave antennas to receive the signals, Sterling had laid new cable lines beneath the streets of and into buildings throughout Manhattan, and repurposed Teleguide's existing cable infrastructure for use by the new operation. Sterling's use of underground cables complied with a longstanding New York City Council ordinance‚Äîoriginally implemented to prevent broad-scale telephone and telegraph outages, after a severe blizzard affecting the Northeastern United States in March 1888 had caused widespread damage to above-ground utility lines in the area‚Äîrequiring all electrical and telecommunication wiring to be laid underground to limit weather-related service disruptions, and because the multitude of tall buildings on Manhattan Island subjected television signals to reception impairments. Dolan curried the financial backing of Time-Life, Inc. (then the book publishing unit of Time Inc.), resulting in Manhattan Cable becoming one of the company's first cable system properties. Despite the investments from Time-Life's share of Sterling (initially 20% at the beginning of operations), Sterling Manhattan consistently lost money throughout its first six years of operation; the company incurred much of its debt from underground wiring expenses (costing as much as $300,000 per mile), and its difficulties attracting new subscribers to generate income (Manhattan Cable managed to receive only around 400 customers by 1967). On August 27, 1969, in an ownership consolidation of the cable assets, Sterling Communications acquired the 49% share in Sterling Manhattan held by Time-Life, in exchange for stock and other assets worth $1.84 million. (Time-Life's interest in Sterling Communications concurrently increased from 25% to 44.5%.) Desperate to keep the company afloat, Dolan began conceiving ideas to help make Sterling Manhattan profitable. In the summer of 1971, while on a family vacation en route to France aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2, he began developing a proposal for a cable-originated television channel. The concept, codenamed \\"The Green Channel\\", was for a subscription service that would offer unedited theatrical movies licensed from the major Hollywood film studios and live sporting events, all presented without interruptions by advertising and sold for a flat monthly fee to prospective subscribers. Dolan wanted to offset the service's start-up costs by having Sterling enter into carriage agreements with other cable television providers to transmit and sell the service to their customers, and draw revenue from fees charged to subscribers who added the channel onto their existing cable service (which then consisted exclusively of local and imported broadcast stations). Dolan later presented his idea to management at Time-Life, who, despite the potential benefit to the company's cable assets, were initially hesitant to consider the \\"Green Channel\\" proposal. In the early 1970s, the cable television industry was not very profitable, and was under constant scrutiny from FCC regulators and the major broadcast television networks (CBS, NBC and ABC), who saw cable as a threat to their viability. Attempts to launch pay television services had been done on an experimental basis in the United States dating to 1951 (among them, Phonevision in New York City, Chicago and Hartford; SubscriberVision in New York City; Telemeter in Palm Springs, California; and Telemovies in Bartlesville, Oklahoma) with little to no success, muzzled by campaigns backed by movie theater chains and commercial broadcasters to assuage television viewers to the supposed threat of pay television to the movie industry and free-to-air television access, limited user interest, and FCC restrictions on the types of programming that could be offered to subscription services. Undeterred, Dolan managed to persuade Time-Life to assist him in backing the project. After the Federal Communications Commission ruled that local governments could not restrict the operation of subscription television services in cable franchise terms, in July 1971, Sterling Communications‚Äînow consisting of Sterling Manhattan; its Long Island-based sister system, Sterling Nassau Cable Television; production firm Allegro Films; and direct- to-cable programming firm Television Presentations Inc.‚Äîinformed the FCC that it planned to operate a cable-originated pay television service. Because Sterling's New York City Council franchise grant specifically required FCC approval for that purpose, Time/Sterling filed an FCC request to authorize pay television operations. Sterling indicated that a subscription television operation would also help Sterling Manhattan fund its fledgling local origination channel, which had incurred $1 million in start-up debt on top of annual company operating losses of $250,000. On September 10, 1971, the FCC gave preemptive authorization to Time-Life and Sterling Manhattan Cable to begin a pay television operation. On November 2, 1971, Time Inc.'s board of directors approved the \\"Green Channel\\" proposal, agreeing to give Dolan a $150,000 development grant for the project. To gauge potential consumer interest, Time-Life sent out a direct-mail research brochure to residents in six U.S. cities. An overwhelming majority of those surveyed (approximately 99%) opposed the idea of paying for a subscription television service, with only 1.2% favoring the concept and expressing interest in being a paying subscriber. In a second survey conducted by an independent consultant, 4% of respondents polled said they were \\"almost certain\\" to subscribe to such a service. A subsequent test conducted by Time-Life to respondents in Allentown, Pennsylvania had salesmen present the pay channel concept to residents by offering them free service for the first month and a refundable installation fee; half of all interviewed residents had expressed interest in purchasing the conceptual service with the offered incentives. During the planning stages, film distributors initially expressed reluctance to license their movies to the Sterling project unless they were provided a count of its potential audience reach and subscription pricing estimates to establish a licensing payment structure similar to their compensation from films shown in theaters. Since the channel would air films without edits for objectionable content, cable operators also wanted to know what movies would be shown on the service to avoid potential advertiser objections and FCC fines for indecency. Sterling executives ultimately agreed to pay a flat licensing fee to the movie studios to acquire film rights. Sterling also allowed cable operators the ability to market the service directly to their customers. Time-Life and Sterling Communications soon proposed for the \\"Sterling Cable Network\\" to be the name of the new service. Discussions to change the service's name took place during a later meeting of Dolan and the executive staff he hired for the project, who ultimately settled on calling it \\" _H_ ome _B_ ox _O_ ffice\\", which was meant to convey to potential customers that the service would be their \\"ticket\\" to movies and events. The moniker was intended as a placeholder name in order to meet deadlines to publish a memorandum and research brochures about the new service; management intended to come up with a permanent name as development continued, however, the \\"Home Box Office\\" name stuck. Multiple obstacles had to be overcome to get the service on the air. A New York City Council provision applying to the company's franchise agreement prohibited the telecast of theatrical feature films over pay television franchises. To circumvent this, rather than launch Home Box Office over Sterling Manhattan, Dolan chose to scout another city with two competing cable franchises to serve as its inaugural distribution system. Originally, he settled on the Teleservice Cable (now Service Electric) system in Allentown. However, management found out that Allentown and surrounding areas fell within the Philadelphia 76ers's television blackout radius, which the team enforced to protect ticket sales. Since HBO was planning to carry regular-season and playoff games from the National Basketball Association (NBA), any 76ers games that the service aired would have been prohibited from being shown within Allentown. Time-Life subsequently agreed to an offer by Teleservice president John Walson to launch HBO on the company's Wilkes-Barre system (located outside of the 76ers' blackout radius), fed from an AT&T; microwave link at the Pan Am Building in New York. (HBO, which elected to forego pursuing telecast rights to 76ers basketball games, would sign on to Teleservice's Allentown system as its second cable affiliate in February 1973.) In August 1972, the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO) attempted unsuccessfully to block Sterling's application to build three community antenna relay (CARS) facilities it planned to use to transmit HBO, over concerns that pay cable service would compete unfairly with movie theaters by using revenue from cable systems to \\"siphon\\" content and, by association, audiences from theatres. Launch and expansion as a regional service (1972‚Äì1975) Original HBO logo, used from November 8, 1972 to May 1, 1975. Home Box Office launched at 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time on November 8, 1972. The service's inaugural program and event telecast, a National Hockey League (NHL) game between the New York Rangers and the Vancouver Canucks from Madison Square Garden (part of a long-term agreement to broadcast sports events based at the Manhattan arena), was transmitted that evening over channel 21‚Äîits original assigned channel on the Teleservice system‚Äîto its initial base of 365 subscribers in Wilkes-Barre. (A plaque commemorating the launch event is located at Public Square in downtown Wilkes-Barre, established in honor of Service Electric's April 1984 addition of HBO sister channel Cinemax to its lineup. Wilkes-Barre resident Marion Sabestinas, who was the first Teleservice customer to sign up to pay the $6 fee to receive Home Box Office's programming at launch, was honored with a lifetime subscription to Cinemax as part of the plaque ceremony.) The first movie presentation shown on the service aired immediately after the sports event: the 1971 film Sometimes a Great Notion, starring Paul Newman and Henry Fonda. Initially airing nightly on an open- ended schedule dependent on the length of the evening's programs (usually from 7:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. ET), Home Box Office's programming initially consisted solely of theatrical films‚Äîincluding four or five recent titles per month‚Äîand event programming. Each evening's schedule was arranged to present either a double feature (which, under FCC anti-siphoning rules then maintained to protect programming supply for broadcast stations until they were struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in March 1977, tended to be releases dating no more than two years from their initial theatrical exhibition), or a combination of either a sports or special event and a theatrical movie, often bridged by a short film or other interstitial content. Home Box Office licensed theatrical motion pictures from various film studios (such as Warner Bros. Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Universal Studios, Columbia Pictures and Paramount Pictures) on a per-title basis; each film received as many as five showings during their scheduled calendar month, depending on the quantity of titles available each month. HBO typically prohibited showings of X-/NC-17-rated, pornographic and foreign art films. Home Box Office‚Äôs extensive and exclusive sports coverage differentiated it from many other subscription television services that launched in the succeeding decades, laying the groundwork‚Äîto an extent‚Äîfor the development of ESPN and other cable-originated sports networks, and was replicated during the 1970s and early 1980s by local subscription services‚Äîincluding PRISM, ONTV and Wometco Home Theater. Through a contractual amendment signed on November 1, 1972, HBO inherited broadcast rights to Madison Square Garden-originated events that had been contracted to a Sterling Manhattan for one of its local origination channels (which served as the progenitor of the MSG Network) since May 1969. Throughout its first eight years, HBO‚Äôs sports lineup included New York Yankees Major League Baseball games; NCAA Division I college basketball games originating from Madison Square Garden; World Football League (WFL) games; American Basketball Association (ABA) games; North American Soccer League games; select LPGA golf tournaments; Canadian Football League games; World Hockey Association regular season and playoff games; Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) tournaments (including the Men's Ice Hockey Tournament and the ECAC Holiday Festival basketball tournament); World TeamTennis; the National Horse Show; the Westchester Kennel Club Dog Show; and Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) tournament events. Out of its sports broadcasts, boxing would be the most enduring part of HBO‚Äôs programming lineup, beginning with its January 22, 1973, telecast of \\"The Sunshine Showdown\\", a world heavyweight championship bout from Kingston, Jamaica‚Äîin which George Foreman defeated Joe Frazier in two rounds‚Äîthat effectively began what became the network‚Äôs flagship sports program, HBO World Championship Boxing. As part of their subscription, subscribers received Home Box Office: Your Monthly Entertainment Guide (later retitled HBO On Air in September 1975, and then [The] HBO Guide in February 1977). The digest size program guide‚Äîwhich would also be distributed to guest rooms of HBO's hotel clients starting in 1978‚Äîprovided programming highlights and complete daily listings for the month; until the May 1980 issue, it also featured \\"HBO Soundtrack\\" (originally \\"Up Front\\"), an occasional column outlining HBO's upcoming programming and answering common programming questions. The HBO Guide ceased print publication in December 2008; a PDF-formatted online program guide, borrowing from the print version's format, began publishing in January 2002, and was made available for download through the websites of HBO and Cinemax (for which the PDF guide was marketed jointly until it ceased publication after the February 2020 issue), and the Home Box Office Inc. lodging website (until site maintenance ceased in August 2014). HBO's launch came with very little fanfare in the press; other than print advertisements promoting the launch in the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader, the service's debut lacked coverage from local or national media outlets. The city administrator of Wilkes-Barre declined an offer to attend the launch ceremony, while Time Inc. vice president J. Richard Munro became stranded in traffic on the George Washington Bridge en route from Manhattan, and was not able to arrive in Wilkes-Barre for the ceremony. Further complicating preparations for the inaugural telecast, in Midtown Manhattan, strong winds‚Äîproduced by a storm system that brought areas of freezing rain over portions of the New York City area that evening‚Äîtoppled the Pan Am Building reception dish being used to relay the Home Box Office signal to microwave towers linked to Teleservice's Wilkes-Barre headend. Time-Life representatives sent a technician to repair the antenna in time for the service's launch, completing maintenance about 25 minutes before the initial telecast. By the end of 1972, the service was received by 1,395 subscribers, all from Teleservice customers in Wilkes-Barre; this number increased to around 4,000 subscribers by February 1973, across Teleservice's Wilkes-Barre, Allentown and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, systems. A third Time-commissioned pay television study by Lieberman Research Inc. released that month, surveying 450 Telecable Wilkes-Barre subscribers (split evenly between 150 current, former or non-subscribers of HBO), found 79% of all respondents (including 76% of former subscribers and 59% of non- subscribers) preferred at-home viewing of movies; male respondents expressed strong interest in viewing sports events on pay television, while a mostly female share of respondents had a strong interest in seeing pay television broadcasts of live Broadway musicals and plays. Time Inc. president James R. Shepley, who was a driving force behind the development of HBO at the corporate level, said: \\"Time Inc. has long been has long been intrigued with this method of communication. Initial marketing results indicate a bright role for subscription television. It seems clear that people are willing to pay fair prices to see television programs of their choice which are free of commercials.\\" On February 28, 1973, Sterling Communications announced it would spin-out HBO and associated assets into a new subsidiary, Home Box Office, Inc. Time Inc. received 9% of Sterling's HBO equity (expanding the former's controlling HBO shares to around 75% of its equity) and committed a $3-million direct investment in the subsidiary. Sterling also raised Time's equity in the company to 66.4% in exchange for the added HBO stake, through the purchase of additional stock and a converted $6.4-million note obligation. Charles Dolan‚Äîwho reportedly had major disagreements with Time-Life management on policy issues, claims which the company denied‚Äîsubsequently resigned as chief executive officer of Sterling Communications and HBO, accepting a $675,000 buyout of a portion of his stock while remaining on the board of directors at both companies in the interim; Dolan used portions of the sale's proceeds to repurchase Time's share of the Sterling Nassau systems and to start the Long Island Cable Community Development Co. (the forerunner to Cablevision Systems Corporation, which would be combined with the Sterling/Cablevision systems on Long Island) as the system's parent company. Gerald M. Levin‚Äîan entertainment industry attorney previously with New York City-based law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, who had been with Home Box Office since it began operations as its director of finance, and later as its vice president and director of programming‚Äîreplaced Dolan as the company's president and CEO. Expanding beyond movies and sports, 1973 saw HBO innovate the concept of original programming for cable television, developing entertainment programming produced by and, at least initially, intended for exclusive broadcast on the channel. On March 23, 1973, HBO broadcast its first non- sports entertainment special, the Pennsylvania Polka Festival, a three-hour- long music event broadcast from the Allentown Fairgrounds in Allentown. On May 9, 1973, Time sold its controlling share of Sterling to Warner Communications for $20 million; high start-up and operating costs for HBO and other Sterling cable assets were reported to be the cause of the sale. Time intended to convert the 260,000 convertible notes it held in Warner's cable television unit, Warner Cable Communications, into common stock shares totaling up to 20% in interest. Sterling would then maintain oversight of Home Box Office under Warner's purview. The Time-Warner cable deal was terminated on June 27, after both companies failed to reach a definitive sale agreement for HBO and the other Sterling subsidiaries; financial arrangements made between Sterling and the New York City Council as part of their 20-year noncompete franchise agreement were alleged to have curtailed the sale. On July 19, 1973, Time Inc. reached an agreement to purchase and assume financial liabilities of Sterling Communications for $6.2 million (including $3.1‚Äêmillion in redeemed public debentures). Time completed its acquisition of Sterling on September 18, 1973, formally dissolving the Sterling holding company and transferring Home Box Office and Sterling Manhattan Cable to its Time-Life Broadcast division. (The \\"Sterling\\" name was subsequently removed from the Manhattan system, which was renamed \\"Manhattan Cable Television\\".) As the acquisition was being completed, HBO was struggling to grow: by October, the service had around 8,000 subscribers across 13 cable systems in Pennsylvania and southern New York State that cumulatively served 110,095 subscribers, and it was suffering from a significant churn rate as subscribers who found the channel's program scheduling repetitive, because of the limited allotment of movies outside of special events, decided to cancel their service. In January 1974, HBO expanded its programming to an average of eight hours per day (from 5:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. ET/PT) on weekdays and twelve hours (from 1:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. ET) on weekends, depending on that day‚Äôs programming lineup. Along with movies and sports, programming at this time had expanded to include concert specials and other music programs, daytime children's programs and various instructional series. With its programming expansion to late afternoons, the service began maintaining a longstanding watershed policy prohibiting R-rated feature films from airing before 8:00 p.m. ET/PT. The policy may be traced to HBO's availability at the time on analog cable tiers, and was maintained long after competing premium services began offering daytime showings of R-rated films as early as 1980 because of subscriber objections to the practice. The policy was extended to encompass TV-MA-rated original series, movies and documentaries once the television industry implemented the TV Parental Guidelines system on January 1, 1997. (, enforcement of the watershed policy on the main HBO feed has been greatly diminished: it currently permits afternoon airings of R-rated films and TV-MA- rated programs; however, it does not allow such programming to be scheduled earlier than 2:00 p.m. ET/PT, with the time of initial airings of R-rated films varying each day. The watershed policy was never extended to most of HBO‚Äôs multiplex channels, although HBO Family, since its December 1996 launch, has prohibited R-/TV-MA-rated programs from airing on its schedule.) Over the two years following its launch, Home Box Office steadily expanded its regional reach: it became available in New York State for the first time in October 1973, when TelePrompTer's Mount Vernon and Ceracche TV Corp.'s Ithaca systems began offering the service. by January 1974, HBO was available on 14 cable systems in New York State and Pennsylvania; The service's addition to UA-Columbia's Wayne system expanded its regional coverage expanded into New Jersey in June 1974. In order to stem its financial losses, on November 13, 1973, Manhattan Cable‚Äîwhich had announced its intent to offer HBO as an extra-fee subscription offering in July of that year, as a move to stem net losses exceeding $10 million‚Äîfiled a request to the City of New York to allow operation of a pay channel. On June 21, 1974, the New York City Board of Estimate passed a resolution that opened access for programmers to lease channel space for subscription television services on Manhattan Cable and TelePrompTer Cable, and cleared Manhattan Cable to offer HBO on a two-year experimental leased basis, in exchange for a 5% fee paid to the city from the system's subscription revenue share. Although the resolution permitted it to offer HBO to its subscribers in Midtown and Lower Manhattan immediately, in order to market the service to potential subscribers, Manhattan Cable Television waited until October 18, 1974, to begin offering HBO on its lineup. (Manhattan Cable turned its first quarterly profits in the first half of 1976, generated in part from, among other factors, revenue from HBO subscriptions.) Terrestrial transmission of HBO via multipoint distribution service began by the Fall of 1974, available to residents in Philadelphia and Wilmington, Delaware (via Micro-TV Inc.) and to select apartment buildings in Queens. (MDS transmission would supplement HBO's coverage into the late 1980s, to both distribute its programming in areas with limited to no cable penetration and as an alternative means to receive the network in areas with cable service.) As Home Box Office's distribution expanded throughout the northern Mid- Atlantic United States, Time/Sterling established a network of microwave receivers and connecting cables on utility landlines to feed HBO's programming from the New York relay antenna to the service's participating cable systems. Although its base had grown from what it had when HBO was being conceived, Sterling Manhattan Cable continued to lose money because the company had only a small subscriber base of 20,000 customers within Manhattan; HBO also faced financial issues, losing nearly $9,000 per month in part due to fees it paid to AT&T; (averaging $11,000) to maintain its New York-based microwave link that was not made up for through the monthly fees it collected from subscribers. Initially, HBO received only a $3.50 cut from the $6.50 monthly fee paid by subscribers (equivalent to $ adjusted for inflationAs calculated by the US Bureau of Statistics' CPI Inflation Calculator), the remainder of which went to cable systems that offered the service. In November 1974, as it was observing its second anniversary, HBO‚Äîthen available to cable television and MDS systems in Pennsylvania, New York State, New Jersey and Delaware‚Äîhad passed the 40,000-subscriber mark. By April 1975, the service had around 100,000 subscribers within its four-state service area. HBO‚Äôs sports coverage expanded in July 1975, as it inaugurated regional coverage of the Wimbledon tennis tournament. (That year saw Arthur Ashe defeat defending champion Jimmy Connors, 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì1, 5‚Äì7, 6‚Äì4, in the Gentlemen's Singles final, becoming the first Black male to win a Wimbledon singles title.) Initially, the HBO telecasts of the tournament mainly consisted of replays culled from other video sources (including the BBC); HBO Sports began to employ an in-house team of commentators starting with the 1978 tournament. Throughout its tenure on the channel, Wimbledon coverage on HBO‚Äîwhich was the first television network to offer weekday tennis coverage on network television‚Äîconsisted of singles and doubles events from the early rounds of the tournament. (NBC‚Äîwhich had the over-the-air broadcast rights to Wimbledon since 1969‚Äîmaintained rights to the quarterfinal, semifinal and final rounds as well as weekend early-round matches.) National expansion, innovation and rise to prominence (1975‚Äì1989) The RCA Satcom domestic communication satellite launched on December 13, 1975, spurred the cable television industry to unprecedented heights ‚Äì with the assistance of HBO. In the Fall of 1974, executives from Time Inc. and the Home Box Office unit began conceptualizing ideas to expand HBO into a national pay television service. Developing a vast infrastructure of microwave and coaxial telephone relay towers in all 50 states and U.S. territories would have been cost-prohibitive for Time/HBO due to the time and expense involved. HBO's existing microwave network was also expensive and difficult to maintain‚Äîespecially in winter, when snow and ice storms periodically disrupted service‚Äîalong with being geographically limiting, as the signal could only be fed to an affiliated cable system if it was along the microwave signal's path. Seeing it as the only efficient and cost-effective option to expand distribution of Home Box Office to the entire nation, Time settled on using a geostationary communications satellite to transmit HBO directly to cable providers throughout the United States within and outside of its existing microwave relay network. Other television broadcasters at the time were hesitant about uplinking their feeds to satellite because they feared that the satellites may inadvertently shut down or jettison out of their orbit, as well as holding reservations about the cost of purchasing downlink receiver dishes, which in 1974, were sold for as much as $75,000 ( adjusted for inflation). Sid Topol, president of cable television equipment manufacturer Scientific Atlanta, met with RCA Americom Communications (which was granted FCC permission to operate and launch a telecommunications satellite), Home Box Office and a group of multiple system cable operators (MSOs) to propose having the RCA satellite transmit the HBO signal; Scientific Atlanta (through a client arrangement with Transcommunications Corp.) would agree to build earth-based satellite relay stations to be set up outside of HBO's Manhattan headquarters and to the service's client cable systems. RCA and HBO agreed to Topol's proposal, and the Time-Life board subsequently approved the satellite transmission plan. On April 11, 1975, Levin and Time- Life unveiled plans to distribute the HBO signal via satellite to cable systems elsewhere throughout the United States, announcing a $7.5-million agreement (including $6.5 million allocated by Levin) with RCA Americom to lease a transponder on the then-under construction Satcom I‚Äîwhich was expected to be launched at the end of 1975‚Äîfor a five-year term. HBO also signed an agreement to distribute the satellite feed on eight UA-Columbia Cablevision systems in California, Texas, Florida, Arizona, Arkansas and Washington State, and have earth station receivers built at their headends to intercept and relay the signal. Now that a more superior transmission method than Home Box Office's existing land-based distribution network was being developed, Time/HBO lined up agreements with various cable system operators‚Äîincluding MSOs like American Television and Communications Corporation, Comcast, Cox Cable Jones Intercable, Heritage Communications and TelePrompTer Cable‚Äîto redistribute the satellite feed for system-determined fees of between $6 and $9 per month. HBO also entered into preliminary discusions with Kansas City-based regional cable service Target Network Television, from which a deal did not materialize, to share a transponder, either by dividing their respective airtime to allow HBO broad coverage in the Midwestern United States or dividing transmission by geographic region. Through the Scientific Atlanta contract, UA-Columbia and other cable providers also commissioned earth station dishes through Scientific Atlanta to receive the HBO satellite feed at their headend sites. On September 30, 1975 at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Home Box Office became the first television network to continuously deliver its signal via satellite when it transmitted the \\"Thrilla in Manila\\", televised from the Araneta Coliseum in Cubao, Philippines. Subscribers of UA-Columbia's Fort Pierce and Vero Beach, Florida systems and American Television and Communications's Jackson, Mississippi system joined HBO's existing cable and MDS affiliates in the Mid-Atlantic U.S.‚Äîsome of which were beginning to transition from microwave to satellite delivery of the network‚Äîin receiving the heavyweight championship boxing match that saw Muhammad Ali defeat Joe Frazier by technical knockout. HBO temporarily fed its domestic Eastern and Pacific feeds to Westar 1 for the first four months of satellite transmissions; the network's transmissions shifted to Satcom 1 when full-time commercial service began on February 28, 1976. The network's programming expanded with the switch to satellite transmission, operating daily from 1:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. ET/PT in an extension of its weekend schedule to weekdays. (A lack of G- and PG-rated films in its inventory and low afternoon viewership were cited for a 20-hour rollback of HBO's weekly schedule on October 11, 1976‚Äîreverting to the 5:30 p.m. ET/PT weekday start time it had prior to the start of its satellite feeds and, with adjustments for sports events, reducing its weekend schedule to begin at 3:00 p.m. ET/PT.) Through the use of satellite, the network began transmitting separate programming feeds for the Eastern and Pacific Time Zones, allowing the same programs that are first broadcast in the eastern half of the United States to air at accordant times in the western part of the country. One month after the satellite launch, preliminary estimates‚Äîtaken toward the end of an extended free preview of HBO on all three systems‚Äîshowed that around 8,250 of approximately 25,630 subscribers between the three charter systems had signed up for the service, and within three months of the satellite uplink, 58,000 customers (or approximately 32% of their combined penetration) among six of the eleven cable systems that added HBO‚Äîin Jackson, Mississippi; Fort Pierce and Vero Beach, Florida; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Fort Smith, Arkansas; and Laredo, Texas‚Äîhad signed up for the service, joining 230,000 subscribers in the Northeastern U.S. HBO estimated that eleven cable systems received its signal via satellite by the end of 1975. HBO achieved coast-to- coast distribution in December 1975, when TelePrompTer added the network to its Seattle‚ÄìTacoma, Washington, systems, extending its reach to the West Coast. By 1977, two fledgling cable networks had joined HBO in pioneering satellite delivery for the cable television industry, along with conceiving the concept of modern basic cable service, becoming the first of many to adopt satellite transmission over the coming years: Atlanta-based independent station WTCG-TV (soon to become WTBS), which, through then-owner Ted Turner, became the first independent station to become a national superstation in December 1976; and the upstart CBN Satellite Service (and later to become the present-day Freeform), started by Pat Robertson as the first satellite- delivered religious network in April 1977. On December 31, 1975, HBO premiered its first comedy special, An Evening with Robert Klein, the first of nine HBO stand-up specials that the comic headlined over 35 years. Positive viewer response to the special led to the creation of On Location, a monthly anthology series that presented a stand-up comedian's nightclub performance in its entirety and uncut; it premiered on March 20, 1976, with a performance by David Steinberg. The network would gradually cultivate a reputation in the comedy world for its stand-up specials, which have helped raise the profile of established comedians (including George Carlin, Alan King, Rodney Dangerfield, Billy Crystal and Robin Williams) and served as the launchpad for emerging comic stars (such as Dennis Miller, Whoopi Goldberg, Chris Rock, Roseanne Barr, Patton Oswalt, Margaret Cho and Dave Chappelle), many of whom have gone on to television and film careers. First version of HBO's logo, used from May 1, 1975 to January 31, 1981; during 1980, HBO used this logo in tandem with the second incarnation of the logo (seen above, in the Infobox) that is still used . By April 1976, Home Box Office reached 386,000 subscribers (306,000 through its terrestrial microwave-landline network, 75,000 through satellite distribution, and 5,000 through MDS-served apartment complexes.) It passed 500,000 subscribers by August 1976, including 180,000 brought into HBO's base through the July 27 closure of its purchase of pay-television programming services company Telemation Program Services, which Time/HBO acquired to provide content mediation with program distributors and, with initial intent, to use Telemation to develop \\"customized\\" programing schedules for HBO's cable affiliates. (Through a contest searching for its 500,000th subscriber, HBO rewarded married elementary school teachers Lester and Carole Diehl, who subscribed through United Cable Television's San Leandro, California system, with an expense-paid vacation to Hawaii and a $200 cash prize presented at a San Francisco press conference featuring comedian John Byner that was shown during the October premiere of his first On Location special.) Concert-based music specials became a part of the network‚Äôs content with the June 19, 1976, premiere of The Fabulous Bette Midler Show, a stage special featuring Midler performing music and comedy routines. It served as the linchpin for the creation of Standing Room Only, a monthly series featuring concerts and various stage \\"spectaculars\\" (including among others, burlesque shows, Vaudeville routines, ventriloquism and magic performances) taped live in front of an audience, which premiered on April 17, 1977 with Ann Corio's 'This Was Burlesque' as inaugural broadcast. By the end of 1977, the network had around one million subscribers across 435 cable and MDS systems serving 45 states. Time's third-quarter fiscal report that year disclosed that HBO had turned its first profit in nearly five years of operation. The network achieved full nationwide distribution in December 1978, having garnered 750 cable affiliates in all 50 U.S. states with around two million subscribers. Programming gradually expanded over time; by January 1979, HBO's programming day lasted between nine and eleven hours per day (usually from 5:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. ET/PT) on weekdays and around 12¬Ω hours (usually from 2:30 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. ET/PT) on weekends. By April 1980, when the current version of its 1975 logo was first introduced, the full \\"Home Box Office\\" name had been de-emphasized in most on-air and other promotional parlance, in favor of identifying under the \\"HBO\\" initialism. (The full name is still used as the legal corporate name of its parent subsidiary under WarnerMedia, and is used on-air in copyright legalese during the end credits of its original programs and network IDs shown twice per day‚Äîin the morning and late afternoon‚Äîat the close of promotional breaks; presenting credits shown at the start of its original specials; and a proprietary vanity card‚Äîbased on the \\"static noise\\" card that has preceded HBO's original series, specials and documentaries since 1993‚Äîshown at the close of the network's original programs.) Subscribership mostly doubled each year into the early 1980s, increasing from around four million subscribers (across 1,755 systems) in December 1979 to around 10.4 million subscribers (across 3,600+ systems) by November 1982. On June 5, 1981, HBO announced it would transition to a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week programming schedule at the start of 1982. Then-HBO President James Heyworth said the decision was effectively forced by rival Showtime's announcement of its pending switch to a 24-hour daily schedule effective July 4 (both announcements were made at that year's National Cable Television Association [NCTA] Convention), as well as the prior switches of The Movie Channel (on December 1, 1979) and Cinemax (on January 1, 1981) to 24-hour programming. (Along with the four larger pay services, Spotlight offered 24-hour programming from September 1, 1981 until it ended operations on February 28, 1984. Home Theater Network, in contrast, maintained a 12-hour-a-day schedule from January 1, 1982‚Äîwhen its programming day expanded by approximately three hours‚Äîuntil it ended operations on January 31, 1987.) The first phase of the switchover commenced on September 4, 1981, when HBO adopted a \\"24-hour\\" weekend schedule (typically running about 58 consecutive hours, from 5:00 p.m. ET/PT Friday until 3:00 a.m. ET/PT Sunday/early Monday). To facilitate the extra weekend programming, HBO and Modern Talking Pictures, then-owner of the Modern Satellite Network (MSN; now defunct), agreed to trade their respective leased timeslots on Satcom I transponder 22 (then assigned to HBO's Pacific Time feed). MSN‚Äîwhich had earlier subleased the bulk of its afternoon hours to Hearst/ABC Video Services for its planned women's channel Daytime‚Äîsubleased its weekend transponder hours (from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. ET/PT) to HBO, in exchange for the latter's unused weekday 10:00 a.m. to noon ET/PT transponder time. Three months later on December 28, 1981, it began offering a full 168-hour weekly schedule (except for occasional interruptions for scheduled early-morning technical maintenance), adding programming full-time from 3:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. ET/PT Monday through Friday. After having only produced a limited amount of unscripted programming since the debut of its first weekly series, Inside the NFL, in September 1977, 1983 saw HBO venture into original scripted programming. On January 3, 1983, the network premiered Not Necessarily the News, a news satire lampooning the week in politics that originally aired as a comedy special in September 1982. The series was cited as having laid the groundwork for satirical news programs that came in later years (such as The Daily Show, The Colbert Report and a later HBO series, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver), and featured Conan O‚ÄôBrien and Greg Daniels, among other notable comics and comedy writers, among its writing staff over its eight-season run. On January 10, 1983, HBO premiered its first regularly scheduled children's program, Fraggle Rock. Created by Jim Henson (who produced the 1978 ACE Award- winning special Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas for HBO) and co-produced with Television South, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Henson Associates, the series (which ran for five seasons, ending in March 1987) centered on a group of various interconnected Muppet species. Later that year, on May 22, 1983, HBO premiered The Terry Fox Story, the first television movie ever produced for the network and the first to be produced for a pay television channel. The biographical film profiled the Canadian amputee runner (Eric Fryer) who embarked on a cross-country run across Canada to raise money and awareness for cancer research before Fox's deteriorating health from advanced cancer (from which he succumbed) ended the trek after 143 days. Besides its venture into original programming that year, in early 1983, HBO jumped ahead of its competitors to become the first pay television service to broadcast Star Wars. As was common with film rights at the time in the pay-TV industry, 20th Century Fox sold off the premium television rights to the science fiction classic on a non-exclusive basis: HBO, Showtime, The Movie Channel, Home Theater Network and Spotlight were contractually bound to premiere it no earlier than 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time on February 1. However, HBO had managed to air the movie at midnight ET that same day, from a planned debut at 7:30 p.m. ET on February 1, after paying Fox for permission to broadcast the film six hours ahead of the competition without promoting their coup to attract an audience other than night owls. In August 1984, Home Box Office Inc. announced plans to scramble the HBO and Cinemax satellite feeds using the Videocipher II encryption system, becoming the first satellite-delivered television networks to encrypt their signals from unauthorized reception by approximately 1.5 million C-band dish owners as well as by various businesses (including hotels, motels and bars) that used rooftop satellite antennas to freely receive HBO, rather than paying for the network through its affiliated cable systems. Periodic testing of Videocipher II signal scrambling began to be carried out during promotional breaks between programs on HBO's Pacific Time Zone feed on April 15, 1985, and on its Eastern Time Zone feed on April 29. (Testing initially commenced on the Pacific feed of Cinemax on March 15, and extended to that service's Eastern feed on April 22.) By August 1985, encryption extended to the entirety of the daytime schedule (from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. ET/PT) on HBO and Cinemax's respective Eastern and Pacific feeds. HBO and Cinemax began scrambling their signals full-time on January 15, 1986, requiring customers to pay an extra fee to get one or both networks as their subscribers through cable systems had long done. Widespread complaints were fielded to Home Box Office Inc. and satellite dish retailers from television receive-only (TVRO) dish users who previously could view HBO and Cinemax's programming for at no extra cost on their corresponding transponder signals, particularly because of the cost of Videocipher II set-top descramblers needed to unencrypt the signal (retailing up to $395, plus $12.95 each for a monthly subscription [or $19.95 for a bundling of both HBO and Cinemax], equal to or slightly higher than the networks' cable subscription rates, and rental fees for the Videocipher receivers). The Satellite Television Industry Association (SPACE) and independent satellite dealers worried about the negative impact on the satellite business from the loss of unencrypted access to HBO and Cinemax and the expansion of full-time signal scrambling to other basic and premium cable networks, as dish sales sharply plummeted and several satellite retailers across the U.S. closed as a result; this spurred SPACE, in March 1986, to lobby for Congressional legislation to protect access to satellite transmissions. The fallout from the full-time scrambling came to a head four months later on April 26, when John R. MacDougall, an Ocala, Florida satellite dish retailer calling himself \\"Captain Midnight\\", staged his own protest of the changes by redirecting a receiver dish towards HBO's Galaxy 1 transponder and intercepting the network's signal during a late-night presentation of the 1985 spy drama film The Falcon and the Snowman. In this act of broadcast signal intrusion, the film's telecast was overridden with a text-based message written by MacDougall, placed over SMPTE color bars, in protest of the channel's decision to scramble its signal for home satellite subscribers and warning other premium services of possible backlash if they followed suit (\\"$12.95/MONTH ? NO WAY ! [SHOWTIME/MOVIE CHANNEL BEWARE!]\\"). The Federal Communications Commission subsequently charged MacDougall for \\"illegally operating a satellite uplink transmitter\\" in violation of the Communications Act of 1934, for which he pleaded guilty after deciding to cooperate with the FCC's investigation into the incident; under a plea bargain deal, MacDougall was fined $5,000, was put on unsupervised probation for one year, and had his amateur radio license suspended for one year. By May 1987, HBO's programming was received by approximately 15 million subscribers across about 6,700 cable systems nationwide. As the 1980s wound down, HBO saw its subscriber base expand greatly as a byproduct of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike; throughout the strike (which lasted from March 7 to August 7 of that year), HBO had an inventory of first-run programming whereas the broadcast networks were only able to air reruns of their shows because of the abrupt halt to their production schedules and the delayed start of the fall television season. Leaning into its growing prominence in pay television, in 1989, HBO unveiled the promotional campaign \\"Simply the Best\\"‚Äîwhich used the Tina Turner single \\"The Best\\" as its imaging theme in some on-air advertisements‚Äîbasing its programming in comparison to rival Showtime. On January 2, 1989, Selecciones en Espa√±ol de HBO y Cinemax (\\"Spanish Selections from HBO and Cinemax\\"), a Spanish-language audio feed transmitted through, depending on the cable system affiliate, either an auxiliary second audio program channel (accessible through built-in and external multichannel audio decoders) or audio simulcasts via FM radio, launched. The service‚Äîwhich initially launched on 20 cable systems in markets with significant Hispanic and Latino populations, and aimed specifically at Spanish-dominant and first-language Spanish speakers‚Äî originally provided Spanish-dubbed versions of recent feature film releases from HBO and Cinemax's movie suppliers. By that Spring, Selecciones's offerings expanded to include Spanish audio simulcasts of HBO's live boxing matches (except for certain events broadcast exclusively in Spanish on networks such as Galavisi√≥n). Selecciones en Espa√±ol de HBO y Cinemax‚Äîreplaced by two dedicated channel feeds, HBO en Espa√±ol and Cinemax en Espa√±ol, on September 27, 1993, effectively acting as part-time simulcast feeds with added first-run Spanish- language movies (mostly from Mexico, Argentina and Spain), and Spanish dubs of HBO's non-sports-event original programming‚Äîquickly gained interest from providers, expanding to an additional 35 cable systems in various U.S. markets in the weeks following its debut. Time Warner ownership; rising prominence of original programming (1989‚Äì2016) Former HBO headquarters in New York City, United States, April 2017. The network moved its operations to WarnerMedia‚Äôs corporate headquarters at 30 Hudson Yards in the city's West Side district in 2018. On March 4, 1989, Warner Communications‚Äîwhich, ironically, was part-owner of rival pay-cable service The Movie Channel from its launch in 1973 until joint venture group Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment sold its stake in Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc. (now Showtime Networks) to majority partner Viacom in 1986‚Äîannounced its intent to merge with HBO parent Time Inc. for $14.9 billion in cash and stock. Following two failed attempts by Paramount Communications to legally block the merger, as Paramount was seeking to acquire Time in a hostile takeover bid, the merger was completed on January 10, 1990, resulting in the consolidated entity creating Time Warner (now known as WarnerMedia), which , remains the parent company of the network. (Manhattan Cable Television would be integrated into Time Warner Cable‚Äîformed through a consolidation of the cable system assets of American Television and Communications [ATC], which Time acquired for $140 million in January 1978 and subsequently integrated with Manhattan Cable, and Warner Cable Communications‚Äîand would adopt its parent unit's identity in January 1993. Time Warner Cable would be spun-off from its namesake parent as an independent company in 2009, and later merged into Charter Communications in May 2016.) By the start of 1990, HBO served 17.3 million subscribers out of a cumulative 23.7 million subscribers covered between it and sister network Cinemax. On August 1, 1991, HBO and Cinemax became the first subscription television services to launch \\"multiplexed\\" companion channels‚Äîa term coined by then-CEO Michael Fuchs to equate the channel tier to a multi-screen movie theater‚Äîoffering, at no extra charge to HBO subscribers, distinct schedules with programs culled from HBO's programming libraries separate from offerings shown concurrently on their respective parent primary channels. TeleCable customers in Overland Park, Kansas, Racine, Wisconsin and suburban Dallas (Richardson and Plano, Texas) that subscribed to either service began receiving two additional HBO channels, HBO2 and HBO3, as part of a test launch. (A secondary Cinemax channel, Cinemax 2 [now MoreMax], was also test launched on the three systems.) The HBO multiplex expanded to include four additional channels: HBO Family (on December 1, 1996), HBO Comedy (on May 6, 1999), HBO Zone (on May 6, 1999), and HBO Latino (on November 1, 2000). On January 1, 1993, HBO and Cinemax‚Äîaccompanied by Showtime and The Movie Channel‚Äîbecame the first television services in the world to transmit their signals using digital compression technology. The compressed satellite feeds, fed through Galaxy 1, were fixed at compression ratios intended to maintain \\"state-of-the-art\\" signal quality at provider headends. (The DigiCipher system, developed in 1992 by General Instrument to replace the Videocipher II system that was standard among satellite-delivered cable channels, was designed with an advanced encryption algorithm co-developed by AT&T; that was structured to prevent the signal piracy issues that were apparent with the Videocipher II.) The adoption of the DigiCipher allowed Home Box Office, Inc. to transmit three HBO feeds and the primary Cinemax channel through the compression standard to participating systems that adopted the technology, and served as the benchmark for the launch of additional multiplex channels of both HBO and Cinemax utilizing compression‚Äîcommencing with the December 1996 launch of HBO Family and concluding with the 2001 launches of four Cinemax channels: WMax (now MovieMax), @Max (now Cinem√°x), OuterMax and 5StarMax. On March 1, 1994, HBO, Cinemax and rivals Showtime and The Movie Channel implemented a cooperative content advisory system to provide to parents specific information about pay-cable programming content that may be unsuitable for their children; the development of the system‚Äîinspired by the advisory ratings featured in the ‚ÄúHBO Guide‚Äù and other program guides distributed by the major premium cable services, and labeled at each co-owned service‚Äôs discretion‚Äîwas in response to concerns from parents and advocacy groups about violent content on television, allowing HBO and other services to assign individual ratings corresponding to the objectionable content depicted in specific programs (and categorized based on violence, profanity, sexuality or miscellaneous mature material). A revised system‚Äîcentered around ten content codes of two to three letters in length‚Äîwas implemented across HBO and the other participating pay services on June 10, 1994. During the 1990s, HBO began developing a reputation for high-quality and irreverent original programming; it was throughout this decade that the network experienced increasing success among audiences and acclaim from television critics for original series such as Tales from the Crypt (a horror anthology series based on the 1950s EC Comics series of the same name), Dream On (from eventual Friends creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane, and which utilized clips from black-and-white television series to illustrate the thoughts of divorced New York City book editor Martin Tupper [Brian Benben]), Tracey Takes On... (a topical sketch comedy show, in which comedienne Tracey Ullman, tackles a specific subject through sketches and monologues), Mr. Show with Bob and David (a sketch comedy series hosted by Bob Odenkirk and David Cross, featuring on- stage sketches and pre-taped pieces) and Arliss (a Robert Wuhl-led comedy about the exploits of a sports agent). One of the scripted comedy programs that premiered early in the decade, Garry Shandling vehicle The Larry Sanders Show, arguably became HBO's flagship series of the 1990s; although it was not commercially as successful as programs airing on the Big Three networks (ABC, NBC and CBS) and Fox, the show‚Äîwhich followed the production of a fictional late night talk show‚Äîenjoyed a cult status and critical acclaim, and received multiple nominations and wins for many major television awards (including four CableACE Awards, three Primetime Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards and two Peabody Awards). Along with influencing HBO's later scripted programming efforts, Larry Sanders‚Äîwhich ran for six seasons from August 1992 to May 1998‚Äîserved as an influence for other show business-based satire series (such as 30 Rock, My Life on the D-List and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip), the use of celebrity guest stars portraying themselves, the absence of laugh tracks now synonymous with single-camera sitcoms and its use of embarrassment- structured comedy (as later popularized by The Office, Arrested Development and the HBO original comedy Curb Your Enthusiasm). The series ranked #38 on TV Guides list of the \\"50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time\\" in 2002 (becoming the only HBO comedy series to make the list) and was also included in Times list of the \\"100 Best TV Shows of All Time\\" in 2007. The Larry Sanders Show was also ranked by various critics and fans as one of the best TV comedies of the 1990s. The original programs that HBO has developed since the early 1990s have earned the channel numerous Emmy and Golden Globe Award nominations and wins. HBO has been nominated in at least one category at the Emmys and Golden Globes since 1988 (when the network earned its first Emmy nomination for Danny Glover's performance as Nelson Mandela in the 1987 original movie Mandela), and set a record for the most Primetime Emmy nominations for a television network in a single year (137) in 2019. Two reasons for what is perceived as the higher quality of these shows are the quality of the writing on the programs and the fact that as a subscription-only service, HBO does not carry \\"normal\\" commercials; instead the network runs promotions for upcoming HBO programs and behind-the-scenes featurettes between programs. This relieves HBO from some pressures to tone down controversial aspects of its programs, and allows for more explicit content to be incorporated into its shows that would not be allowed to air on broadcast television or basic cable, such as profanity, strong/graphic violence, nudity and graphic sex scenes. In July 1997, HBO premiered its first one-hour dramatic narrative series Oz, centering on the inmates of the Oswald State Correctional Facility, a fictional level 4 maximum-security state prison. The program helped start the trend of narrative dramas incorporating gritty realism and storytelling that became standard among premium cable services to the present day. While Oz was critically acclaimed throughout its six-season run, it was not until The Sopranos premiered in January 1999, that the network achieved widespread critical success with an hour-long drama series. The Sopranos‚Äîcentering on mob patriarch Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) and his family‚Äîreceived 111 Emmy nominations and 21 wins over the course of its six-season run, including two honors for Outstanding Drama Series. The mob drama's first wins for Outstanding Drama and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (for Drea de Matteo) in 2004, two of the four Emmys it won that year, marked the first time that a cable program won in either category over a program on one of the major broadcast networks. 1998 saw the debut of From the Earth to the Moon, a 12-part miniseries that was produced by Tom Hanks, Ron Howard and Brian Grazer and based on the Andrew Chaikin book A Man on the Moon. Costing $68 million to produce, it traced the U.S. space program from the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union through the final moon landing, Apollo 17. From the Earth to the Moon‚Äîwhich won three Emmy Awards, including for Outstanding Miniseries, and a Golden Globe for Best Miniseries or Television Film‚Äîhelped lay the groundwork for other high-profile historical films and miniseries produced by the network in subsequent years including 61* (a Billy Crystal-directed 2001 biopic chronicling New York Yankees legends Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle's New York Yankees race to break Babe Ruth's 1927 single-season record of 60 home runs), Band of Brothers (a ten-part 2001 miniseries produced by Hanks and Steven Spielberg, about the E Company soldiers of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment during the European Theater combat of the Pacific War), John Adams and The Pacific (a ten-part 2010 companion miniseries to Band of Brothers from Spielberg and Hanks, based on the 1992 Stephen E. Ambrose book focusing on the United States Marine Corps's Pacific Theater battles during the Pacific War). In June 1998, Sex and the City, based on the book series of the same name by Candace Bushnell, made its debut on the network. Over the course of its six-season run, the comedy series‚Äîcentering on the friendship and romances of four New York City women‚Äîreceived 54 Emmy nominations and won seven, including one win for Outstanding Comedy Series, and in 2004, the first wins for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series (for Sarah Jessica Parker) and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series (for Cynthia Nixon) for HBO since the network first gained Emmy eligibility. On June 25, 1999, HBO Sports announced it would discontinue coverage of Wimbledon after a 25-year run following that year's tournament, citing a need to \\"refresh\\" HBO‚Äôs programming slate; this left HBO‚Äôs boxing franchises (which expanded in February 1996 to include a secondary program for rising boxing talent, HBO Boxing After Dark, and soon expanded to include a short-lived, hip-hop-infused boxing program, KO Nation, in May 2000) as the lone remaining competitive sports offering in its programming portfolio. As part of a joint contract between HBO sister company Turner Broadcasting System, NBC and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, the tournament rights shifted over the succeeding three years between Turner-owned TNT (in 2000), CNN/SI (in 2001) and CNNfn (in 2002), before the cable rights moved over to ESPN (which assumed full U.S. television exclusivity over the championship in 2012) beginning with the 2003 tournament. On March 6, 1999, HBO began transmitting a high definition simulcast feed of its primary channel, becoming the first American cable-originated television network to begin simulcasting their programming in the format. Until January 2001, HBO HD only transmitted some theatrical films from the network's programming suppliers and HBO's in-house original movies in the format, as existing widescreen prints of those films were already scalable in the 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio and could readily be upconverted to HD resolution. Original programming began to be made available in HD on January 14, 2001, as part of a 13-week Sunday \\"encore\\" presentation of the second season of The Sopranos that was remastered in 1080i HD. (HBO had been requiring the producers of its original series to film their episodes in widescreen‚Äîsubsequently downconverted for the standard definition feed‚Äîto fit 4:3 television screens since 1996, in order to future-proof them for remastering in HD.) Sports telecasts were upgraded to HD on September 25, 2004, with an HBO World Championship Boxing fight card headlined by Roy Jones Jr. and Glen Johnson. The 2000s opened with two series that, although they did not surpass The Sopranos in viewership success, maintained similar or matched its critical acclaim, further cementing HBO's reputation as a leading producer of quality television programming. Six Feet Under, premiering in August 2001, was an ensemble drama centering on the lives of a family managing a Los Angeles funeral home. Winning, among others, nine Emmys, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, three Golden Globe Awards and a Peabody Award, it has since been regarded as one of television's best all-time series including under rankings by Time, The Guardian, and Empire. The Wire, premiering in June 2002 and created by author and former police reporter David Simon, was an anthology- style crime drama focusing on different Baltimore institutions and their relationship to law enforcement in each season, tying subsequent storylines through existing characters and prior storylines. While it never won any major television awards, it earned wide critical acclaim for its writing and depictions of criminal and law enforcement issues, also becoming regarded as one of the best series of all time by media organizations such as TV Guide, Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone, and the BBC. The 2003 miniseries Angels in America (based on the Pulitzer-winning play by Tony Kushner, centering around the intersecting lives of six people in 1985 New York), became the first (and to date, only) program to sweep all seven major categories at the Primetime Emmys in the ceremony's history as well as the second program (after Caesar's Hour in 1957) to win all four main acting categories during the 2004 ceremony. In 2005, HBO entered into an agreement with Cingular Wireless (since integrated into the AT&T; Mobility unit of HBO's present-day governing parent company AT&T;) to establish HBO Mobile, a pre-smartphone era mobile subscription web service that provided information on HBO's original programming (including episode guides), mobile wallpapers and ringtones voiced by cast members of the channel's series. (HBO Mobile also operated a similar service, HBO Family Mobile, which offered full-length episodes of the channel's children's programming.) HBO experienced additional viewer success with the 2008 debut of True Blood, a vampire-themed fantasy horror drama based on The Southern Vampire Mysteries gothic novel series by Charlaine Harris. While earning few major television awards throughout its run, True Bloods average viewership often rivaled that of The Sopranos, peaking at an average of 12.4 million per week (counting repeat and on-demand viewership) during its second season. The network saw three more hit series premiere in the 2010s: Game of Thrones‚Äîbased on George R. R. Martin's fantasy novel series A Song of Ice and Fire‚Äîwhich earned both critical and viewer praise, and set a single- year record for Emmy wins by an individual program in 2015 with 12 awards; Girls, a comedy series created by series star Lena Dunham; and True Detective, an anthology-style series‚Äîstructured to feature a different cast and setting within each season's storyline‚Äîwhich initially saw established film actors Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey in its lead roles. On August 13, 2015, HBO announced its re-entry into children's programming, when it reached a five-year programming and development deal with Sesame Workshop. Through the agreement, HBO obtained first-run television rights to Sesame Street, beginning with the January 2016 debut of its 46th season (with episodes being distributed to the program's longtime broadcaster, PBS, following a nine-month exclusivity window at no charge to its member stations); Sesame Workshop will also produce original children's programming content for the channel, which also gained exclusive streaming rights to the company's programming library for HBO Go and HBO Now (assuming those rights from Amazon Video, Netflix and Sesame Workshop's in-house subscription streaming service, Sesame Go, the latter of which will cease to operate as a standalone offering). Although struck with the intent to having the show remain on PBS in some fashion, the nonprofit production company reached the deal due to cutbacks resulting from declines in public and private donations, distribution fees paid by PBS member stations and licensing for merchandise sales. With the debut of HBO Max in May 2020, all Sesame Workshop content will shift from the linear HBO service to the OTT platform upon Max's launch. AT&T; ownership (2016‚Äìpresent) On October 22, 2016, AT&T; announced an offer to acquire Time Warner for $108.7 billion, including debt it would assume from the latter; the merger would bring Time Warner's various media properties, including HBO and Cinemax, under the same corporate umbrella as AT&T;'s telecommunications holdings, including satellite provider DirecTV and IPTV/broadband provider AT&T; U-verse. Time Warner shareholders approved the merger on February 15, 2017. On November 20, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against AT&T; and Time Warner in an attempt to block the merger, citing antitrust concerns surrounding the transaction. U.S. clearance of the proposed merger‚Äîwhich had already received approval from European, Mexican, Chilean and Brazilian regulatory authorities‚Äîwas affirmed by court ruling on June 12, 2018, after District of Columbia U.S. District Court Judge Richard J. Leon ruled in favor of AT&T;, and dismissed antitrust claims asserted in the DOJ's lawsuit. The merger closed two days later on June 14, 2018, with Time Warner becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T;, which renamed the unit WarnerMedia; the Home Box Office, Inc. unit and its assets were assigned to the newly formed WarnerMedia Entertainment division, although it continues to operate as an autonomous subsidiary. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington unanimously upheld the lower court's ruling in favor of AT&T; on February 26, 2019. In July 2018, The New York Times obtained audio from a corporate town hall meeting featuring AT&T; executive John Stankey‚ÄîCEO of WarnerMedia from the merger's completion until May 2020, when Stankey shifted to chief operating officer during his transition to replacing Randall Stephenson as AT&T;'s CEO‚Äîwho argued that HBO's current content model was not profitable enough, and that the network had to produce more content (similar to that offered by streaming services such as Netflix) in order to achieve more engagement with subscribers (including short-form content oriented towards mobile devices), and that HBO needed to \\"move beyond 35 to 40 percent penetration to have this become a much more common product.\\" Stankey's statement contradicted the fact that HBO had been consistently profitable over the last three years, totaling nearly $6 billion, while allocating more than $2 billion per year for programming. Building on this idea, on October 10, 2018, Stankey stated that the company was developing a new over-the-top (OTT) streaming service that would feature content from various WarnerMedia properties including HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. WarnerMedia would later announce on July 9, 2019, that the service would be co-branded with HBO, under the name HBO Max. The service‚Äîwhich was developed under a separate infrastructure from HBO's existing streaming platforms, HBO Go and HBO Now, and will not immediately replace those services‚Äîlaunched on May 27, 2020. On September 27, 2018, HBO announced it would cease airing its boxing telecasts after 45 years‚Äîmarking the end of competitive sports event broadcasts on the network‚Äîfollowing the October 27 edition of HBO World Championship Boxing. (Two additional World Championship Boxing/Boxing After Dark cards would follow that originally scheduled final broadcast, on November 24 and December 8, respectively.) The decision cited factors including the influx of sports-based streaming services (such as DAZN and ESPN+) and issues with promoters that hampered its ability to acquire high-profile fight cards, and resulting declining ratings and loss of interest in the sport among HBO's subscribers, as well as WarnerMedia's efforts to have scripted programming become the primary focus of the network‚Äôs original content. (Since the discontinuance of live sports telecasts, the HBO Sports production unit now exclusively serves to produce sports magazine shows and documentaries for the network.) On November 1, 2018, HBO and Cinemax were pulled from Dish Network and Sling TV in a carriage dispute with Dish Network Corporation over distribution fees, marking only the second known instance that the network had ever been removed from a pay television provider (following a four-month displacement from 17 Times Mirror Cable systems to free up channel space for Spotlight, a rival pay service then owned through a consortium led by Times Mirror, from May to September 1981) and the first to result from a carriage dispute in its then 46-year history. The dispute did not affect Dish/Sling's carriage of WarnerMedia's other cable networks, which were distributed to the satellite and virtual MVPD providers under a separate carriage agreement. , Dish Network and WarnerMedia have not resumed negotiations to restore HBO and Cinemax on the former's pay television services.) On February 28, 2019, Richard Plepler stepped down from his position as CEO of Home Box Office, Inc., after a collective 27-year tenure at HBO and twelve years as head of the network and its parent unit. The New York Times reported that Plepler \\"found he had less autonomy after the merger.\\" On March 4 of that year, AT&T; announced a major reorganization of WarnerMedia's assets, dividing WarnerMedia's television properties among three corporate divisions. Home Box Office, Inc. (encompassing HBO, Cinemax, and their respective wholly owned international channels and streaming services) was reassigned to WarnerMedia Entertainment, placing it under the same umbrella as sister basic cable networks TBS, TNT and TruTV (which were formerly part of the dissolved Turner Broadcasting System subsidiary), and under the leadership of former NBC and Showtime executive Bob Greenblatt. (Other former Turner assets were split between two other new subsidiaries: WarnerMedia News & Sports, which oversees CNN and its sister networks, Turner Sports and management operations for NBA TV, and WarnerMedia Global Kids, Young Adults and Classics, a unit of Warner Bros. that oversees such networks as Cartoon Network and Turner Classic Movies.) On August 10, 2020, WarnerMedia restructured several of its units in a major corporate revamp that resulted in Home Box Office, Inc. and all other WarnerMedia Entertainment assets being consolidated with Warner Bros. Entertainment to form WarnerMedia Studios & Networks Group. HBO/Cinemax President of Programming Casey Bloys‚Äîwho has been with Home Box Office, Inc. since 2004 (as director of development at HBO Independent Productions), and was eventually elevated to programming president in May 2016‚Äîadded oversight of HBO Max and WarnerMedia's basic cable networks to his purview. (The restructuring also resulted in the three former Turner networks reassigned to WarnerMedia Entertainment being brought back under the same umbrella as sister networks Cartoon Network/Adult Swim, Boomerang and Turner Classic Movies.) Among the around 800 employees whose positions were eliminated as part of the changes, the restructuring resulted in the layoffs of around 150 Home Box Office, Inc. employees.

Education and early life  He attended the medical academy of the Ottoman military and during the Turco-Italian war he was deployed to Tripolitania where he met Mustafa Kemal (Atat√ºrk) in 1911. He was stationed in Diyarbakƒ±r during World War I, where the two met once more in 1916. He became an adherent to the Kemalist ideology and was one of the military officers who supported Mustafa Kemal from the start of the Turkish War of Independence.  Political career  After Turkey was created in 1923, he appointed the Turkish ambassador to Poland from June 1924 to January 1926. Later he was involved in the Turkification process of the Turkish territory, which included a large Kurdish population in the eastern provinces. In 1927, he was appointed the Inspector General of the First Inspectorate General, which span over several provinces with a Kurdish majority and was established as a reaction to the Kurdish led Sheikh Said Rebellion. As Inspector General, he had wide-ranging authority in the eastern provinces and was able to deport and resettle people he thought would not fit in the area according to the policies outlined of the Report for Reform on the East. √ñng√∂ren supervised the implemetation of a new Five-Year plan for Security and Disarmament which was announced in April 1932. The soldiers of the Seventh Army of Turkey were involved in the plan due to expected battles. By the end of the year, Tali √ñng√∂ren mentioned that thousands of weapons were confiscated in the campaign and ≈û√ºkr√º Kaya, the Minister of the Interior at the time, elaborated detailed reports about the weapons confiscated. In January 1933 √ñng√∂ren resigned from the post as Inspector-General and was succeeded by Hilmi Ergeneli who served until 1935. In 1934 he was appointed the Inspector General of the newly established Second Inspectorate General in the western provinces of Turkey. In May and June 1934, he traveled through the provinces under his domain and prepared a report concerning the population of the provinces which included a significant Jewish population at the time. He presented his report about the journey to the Ministry of the Interior, which blamed the Jews of being involved in labor unions and also exploiting the Turkish population in the region. Due to health reasons, √ñng√∂ren had to resign from the Inspectorate General in August 1935. He died on the 2 January 1952.  Personal life  Ibrahim Tali √ñng√∂ren was married and had three children.

According to Indian Country Today, Kaur is one of only two Native American oncologists working in the United States.  Early life and education  Kaur is of Choctaw‚ÄìCherokee heritage. At the age of five, her grandmother told her that she was \\"meant to be a healer,\\". She was the first member of her family to graduate from high school, and, after graduating from Augustana College, started her professional career as a teacher. Whilst working as a teacher, Kaur had a daughter and got married. Her husband would come home to see her spending her evenings reading Scientific American. Her husband eventually challenged her to apply to medical school, and in 1975 she was accepted to the University of North Dakota Indian Health Service's Indians into Medicine Program (INMED) programme, which supports Native Americans and Alaska Natives in pursuing careers in healthcare. She originally intended to earn her medical degree and move back to the reservation to work in family medicine. In her third year of medical school, Kaur decided to specialise as an oncologist. She eventually completed her medical degree at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.  Research and career  Kaur is committed to ending health inequities for indigenous communities, looking to transform the medical outcomes of people suffering from cancer. She has focused on increasing participation in clinical trials and supporting indigenous students in pursuing careers in medicine. As one of the first National Cancer Institute (NCI) investigators to collect data on cancer prevalence and perceptions amongst indigenous communities, she has raised awareness of cancer amongst tribes in the Midwest United States. Before the work of Kaur, there was a misconception that cancer was a 'white people's disease'. In particular, Kaur specialises on women's cancers, with a focus on breast and cervical cancer. She has studied the biomarkers of breast cancer in Alaska Natives and Native Americans. She also worked with Alaska Native pregnant women on smoking cessation and exposure to carcinogens. Since founding the resource centre in 1999, Kaur has served as medical director of the American Indian/Alaska Native Cancer Information Resource Center and Learning Exchange (Native CIRCLE). Alongside Native CIRCLE, Kaur leads the American Indian / Alaska Native Initiative on Cancer, Spirit of EAGLES. The programme looks to provide culturally relevant education and research. In particular, Kaur works to improve the access of indigenous communities to the Affordable Care Act. In 2007 Kaur published the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, which identified that despite the progress the United States had made in reducing the prevalence of cancer, this was not reflected in indigenous populations.

The bank's main area of activity is retail banking for private individuals and small and medium-sized companies. Until it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Basler Kantonalbank in 2019 the bank's shares were listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. History Today's Bank Cler was founded on 30 October 1927 by the Association of Swiss Consumers (today Coop) together with the Swiss Federation of Trade Unions as a cooperative central bank - Genossenschaftliche Zentralbank (French: Banque Centrale Coop√©rative; Italian: Banca Centrale Cooperativa). In 1970, the delegates' meeting of the members of the cooperative decided to transform the company into a stock corporation. In 1995 the bank's name was changed to Coop Bank. On 20 December 1999, the Basler Kantonalbank purchased a controlling stake stake in the bank, and in 2001, the name was changed to Bank Coop. As of the end of 2009, the Basler Kantonalbank held a 57.6% share of the bank's stock; a further 10.4% was held by the former parent company - Coop, 5.1% by Swiss trade union associations and 1.1% by the bank in its trading portfolio and in financial investments. The rest of the stock was in free float. In March 2017, Coop sold its remaining shares to the Basler Kantonalbank. On 20 May 2017, the institution undertook a comprehensive rebranding and became Bank Cler (Banque Cler; Banca Cler), Romansh for \\"transparent, simple, clear\\".Die Bank Coop wird zur Bank Cler, Finanz und Wirtschaft, 23 March 2017.

FINMA uncovered \\"substantial support purchases\\" by Bank Coop to counteract a decline in the bank's share price. In doing so, the bank seriously violated the supervisory prohibition of market manipulation and its guarantee as well as its organisational obligations.

Early life  Salguero was born in 1952 in Quito, the fifth daughter of Sixto Salguero, a stage actor, and Mar√≠a Bravo, a professor of history and geography. As a child, she attended the Colegio Americano de Quito. After graduating, she enrolled in the Central University of Ecuador, where she obtained a bachelor's degree in 1973. She subsequently obtained a Ph.D. from the Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador.  Career  Salguero's journalism career began in 1974, and she worked for such magazines as Vistazo and Hogar. She also worked for the publications Nueva, Diario Hoy, El Comercio, and Trazos. She has also worked as a translator for the Ecuadorian government. In 1993 she became the director of the National Cultural Fund, and in 1994 she was named national director of culture.

Beginning in 1964 as a free album insert for fans of the Beach Boys, the magazine was sold separately in 1965 and it grew in popularity. It was introduced as a vehicle to promote the Beach Boys and other Capitol artists, but in the hands of editor Judith Sims, the magazine broke new ground, rising above its fan club origin. Quickly establishing itself as the gateway to the inner circle of the Beatles at the height of Beatlemania, TeenSet parlayed this trust to introduce their readers to new artists, in the process greatly increasing the visibility of Buffalo Springfield, the Doors, Janis Joplin and the Mothers of Invention. The magazine benefited from articles by music critic Sue Cameron, London correspondent Carol Gold, psychedelic maverick Robert Shea (writing under pseudonyms), and photographs from Jim Marshall and Michael Ochs. It began as an early teen girls' magazine but by 1968 was shifting to focus on late teen girls and young women in their early twenties. History=1964‚Äì65 In March 1964, the Beach Boys released the album Shut Down Volume 2 which came with an inner sleeve announcing the invitation, \\"Join the Teen Set on Capitol.\\" The inner sleeve gave instructions for joining the Teen Set fan club, based in Hollywood, California. It promised \\"Details in the next great issue of the Teen Set magazine.\\" The first magazine issue of the Teen Set was ready in October 1964, released as a free insert to the live album Beach Boys Concert. The magazine informed the reader about various aspects of the Beach Boys. None of the articles listed an author. The magazine's chief editor was Brown Meggs, the Capitol executive who had signed the Beatles. Veteran teen magazine journalist and photographer Earl Leaf was hired as guest editor. The second issue was ready in March 1965, printed in a massive run of 500,000, produced by Lou Kimzey and his Kimtex Corporation. The label told Billboard magazine that it was \\"the largest teen-oriented advertising-merchandising campaign in the history of CRDC [Capitol Records Distribution Company].\\" The first 350,000 copies of the magazine were given free with the purchase of a specified teen-oriented Capitol album, including the recent February releases of the Lettermen's Portrait of My Love, and an album by the easy listening Hollyridge Strings (playing orchestral versions of Beatles songs), as well as the March releases of Dick Dale's Live at Ciro's, Bobby Rydell's Somebody Loves You, and The Beach Boys Today! The remaining magazine copies were sold at newsstands for 35¬¢, and they were popular enough for Capitol to move forward with a quarterly publishing schedule. Capitol later reported that they had sold 90,000 of the 150,000 copies set aside for newsstand sales. Artists profiled in the Teen Set volume 2 were Donna Loren, Bobby Rydell, Peter & Gordon and, of course, the Beach Boys. In August 1965, Kimzey told Billboard that he was editor, replacing the Capitol staff. The third and fourth issues were published in runs of 175,000 each by Kimtex. Some non-Capitol artists were included. Featured artists in November 1965 included UK acts such as the Beatles, singer Ian Whitcomb, actor/oboist David McCallum and the Rolling Stones, showing that the British Invasion would be sustained by Capitol through TeenSet. Twenty-five-year-old Judith Sims started as editor to produce the November issue, under publisher Robert Bates of Capitol.Sims, Judith (November 1966). \\"Etc. etc.\\" TeenSet, p. 3 The magazine geared up for a change from quarterly to monthly publication in 1966. 1966‚Äì67 Monthly production began with the February 1966 issue which featured the Beach Boys, the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Sonny & Cher, Herman's Hermits, and an interview with early Beatle drummer Pete Best. The upcoming Elvis Presley film Paradise, Hawaiian Style was teased with photographs taken on location. The price was 35 cents for one issue, or $3 for a yearly subscription, bringing the per-issue price down to 25¬¢.TeenSet, February 1966. Sue Cameron introduced the Mothers of Invention and Buffalo Springfield to TeenSet in the November 1966 issue, an article titled \\"Hollywood Group Scene\\" that also included the Association pop- folk group, and the Everpresent Fullness, a band that saw brief success with Warren Zevon's adaptation of the old Jim Jackson blues song \\"Wild About My Lovin'\\". Michael Vosse kept up interest in Zappa by featuring him in an article published in January 1967.Vosse, Michael (January 1967). \\"Fifty-Four Fab, Boss Questions\\" TeenSet, pp. 46‚Äì48, 60‚Äì61 In December 1966, TeenSet published \\"On Tour with the Beatles\\", showing Sims in close contact with the Beatles as they toured the US. (This turned out to be their final tour.) Sims wrote exciting concert experiences and the daily routine of touring, sharing inside glimpses of the band. Sims later remembered that her position as editor of Capitol's own magazine TeenSet helped her get close to the Beatles who published in the US through Capitol, but she also noted that the major media was uninterested in covering the Beatles' US tour. No reporters had been assigned from Time magazine or Newsweek, so it was just herself, a few other teen magazine editors, and some radio deejays. She wrote that she did not eat with the Beatles \\"nor, alas, sleep with them.\\" Billboard reported that the radio entourage of the Beatles' US tour was composed of deejays Jerry Leighton, Kenny Everett, Jim Stagg, Jerry Ghan, George Klein, Tim Hudson and a few others. The print media was represented by Sims of TeenSet, Bess Coleman of Teen Life, Marilyn Doerfler of Hearst newspapers, and Arthur Unger of progressive teen magazine Datebook who had recently sparked the \\"more popular than Jesus\\" controversy. In January 1967, Sims apologized to her readers about previously being complicit in hiding the married status of the Beach Boys. The catalyst was a recent announcement by Brian Wilson that all five Beach Boys were married, revealing the mild deception of magazines purposely failing to state that musical artists were married, in order to sustain fan interest.Sims, Judith (January 1967). \\"Etc. etc.\\" TeenSet, p. 4 In November 1966, Buffalo Springfield first played their song \\"For What It's Worth (Stop, Hey What's That Sound)\\" at the Whisky a Go Go. Sims heard the song and immediately took a liking to the band, determining to include something about them in every issue. The song played on Los Angeles radio at the end of 1966, then started climbing the charts in early 1967. TeenSet was invaluable in helping to keep the band in the public eye during 1967‚Äì1968, featuring the band in a layout published in January 1967. Sims later said, \\"They just knocked me out. It was obvious they loved playing with each other and respected each other's musicianship. They were a joy to behold.\\" TeenSet picked up American expatriate Carol Gold as the magazine's London correspondent. Gold caught up with the Jimi Hendrix Experience in April 1967 in London, with the interview published in August. When Beatles' manager Brian Epstein died in August, Marilyn Doerfler wrote a remembrance of him, published in the December 1967 issue of TeenSet.Doerfler, Marilyn (December 1967). \\"Brian Epstein ‚Äì In Memory\\". TeenSet Doerfler had previously written in July about a poorly conducted publicity appearance by the Monkees,Doerfler, Marilyn (July 1967). \\"Warning: There‚Äôs a Nut Loose in the Monkee Machine\\". TeenSet, pp. 28‚Äì30 and she had accompanied Sims on the Beatles final tour. =WCFL sponsorship= In mid-1967, Chicago radio station WCFL sponsored a series of TeenSet issues in the Chicago area, adding their call letters to the top of the magazine as sold in Chicago. The \\"WCFL Presents\\" version of TeenSet carried four additional pages of local Chicago music events and advertisements, aimed at the station's fan base. WCFL disc jockey Jim Stagg had previously covered the Beatles final US tour with Sims. 1968‚Äì69 In January 1968, TeenSet included \\"giant wall size\\" posters of Ringo Starr and Micky Dolenz, and the price had risen to 50¬¢ per issue. Carol Gold reported on the UK filming of Magical Mystery Tour film which she had watched in September 1967. The magazine was shifting its aim to reach older high school girls and young women in college. Gold's interview of the Bee Gees was published in February. Around April 1968, Sims interviewed Morrison again at Olivia's in Venice, the restaurant that inspired the Doors' song \\"Soul Kitchen\\". Morrison ate liver and onions while describing the recording process of Waiting for the Sun. Published in June, the cover photo showing Morrison later made this edition a collector's item. Writer Jerry Hopkins interviewed Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, and published stories about them in Rolling Stone and TeenSet. His September 1968 article in TeenSet, \\"That's Funny, You Don't Look Like The Musician Of The Year\\", talked about how the group was known for their onstage antics, or \\"atrocities\\". Hated by some of their audiences, Hopkins joked that the group was \\"both hailed and stoned\\", that is, some listeners were stoning them. The next month, TeenSet included a foldout poster of Zappa, a psychedelic rendering of multiple exposures. in 1968, Jacoba Atlas interviewed Jimi Hendrix in Benedict Canyon, providing enough material for a two-part article. The second half of the interview discussed Hendrix's political views including his thoughts about the Black Panther Party and the Black Power movement; it appeared in the January 1969 issue made controversial because the cover showed white singer Grace Slick in blackface giving the Black power salute. TeenSet sponsored the magazine's \\"first annual\\" (only) ice skating Christmas party in late 1968, held at Topanga Plaza Ice Capades Chalet. With three Canadians in the band, Buffalo Springfield appeared very expert and relaxed on the ice compared to Hearts & Flowers and the Merry-Go- Round. In March 1969, TeenSet published with a question mark next to the magazine name (TeenSet?), which turned out to be the final issue. The cover showed two dolls with pasted-on heads: a naked black G.I. Joe with Jimi Hendrix's head, and a naked Barbie with Mia Farrow's head. This issue hosted an article by Robert Shea writing as \\"Sandra Glass\\", illustrated with glossy magazine cut-out collage figures appearing as puppets controlled by strings. An editor's note said that \\"Miss Glass\\" had had a recent \\"fatal accident\\". The article contained a reference to April Fools' Day, and jokingly concocted a worldwide \\"Illuminati\\" conspiracy involving such disparate elements as Nelson Rockefeller, Raquel Welch, Mao Tse-tung, Thuggee Society and Saint Yossarian. Shea also wrote \\"Morality Is Not Good for You\\" in the same issue, under the name \\"Alexander Eulenspiegel\\". Sims listed this two-page article in the table of contents as \\"The New Morality. It may be just the absence of the old morality.\\"TeenSet, March 1969. In May 1969 the magazine was published with a new name, AUM, an initialism for Adult Underthirty Magazine, also referring to the Hindu meditation word Om. The cover photograph by Ed Caraeff showed four of the GTOs including Pamela Des Barres, each holding a different past issue of TeenSet. The editorial by Sims said the magazine's new title was pronounced \\"awm\\".Sims, Judith (May 1969). \\"Etcetera\\" AUM, p. 3 Continuing with the magazine were writers Jacoba Atlas, Jerry Hopkins, \\"Alexander Eulenspiegel\\" (Robert Shea) and more. The July issue of AUM was the magazine's final appearance, featuring a cover painting titled \\"Aquarius Theatre\\" by The Fool, a Dutch artist duo. Hopkins reported in August that the magazine had been axed by Capitol because of poor sales.Hopkins, Jerry (August 1969). \\"Los Angeles\\". Other Scenes, p. 22. Legacy After TeenSet and AUM shut down, many of the writers went to Rolling Stone, including editor Sims who was hired as the Los Angeles bureau chief. In 2014, the magazine Flashback published a retrospective titled \\"TeenSet: The story behind this pioneering 1960s American rock magazine.\\" From 2016 to 2020, TeenSet has been explored by PhD student Allison Bumsted in her thesis considering multiple aspects of TeenSet magazine and popular music journalism at Liverpool Hope University. Bumsted looks at 'TeenSet from a feminine perspective and reconsiders its role in our popular music journalism history.' Her research will be released in Winter or Spring 2021.

It was controlled by movement of the rotor plane rather than the usual control surfaces, though initially the much modified lone example retained rudders as a precaution. Design and development rotor folded back for storage PA-22 PA-22 rotor head The first autogyros, while relying on the rotor for lift, were controlled in flight with ailerons, elevators and rudders like conventional fixed wing aircraft. The first United States autogyro to dispense with these was the PA-22, which the pilot manoeuvred by altering the rotor plane with a long hanging stick which reached down into the cabin; such designs were termed direct control autogyros. Direct control meant the aircraft could be controlled at the lowest speed at which sufficient lift was available, rather then the higher speeds required for control surface authority. First flown in April 1933, it was first demonstrated in public in Washington D.C. on 8 November 1934. The PA-22 had a three-bladed rotor with a diameter of , pylon-mounted over the cockpit. It was connected via a clutch to the nose-mounted, Pobjoy Cataract engine to spin it up, with rotor blades latched at a low angle of incidence, then unlatched for take-off. Uncowled for cooling and driving a two-bladed propeller, the Cataract powered the PA-22 conventionally once autorotation was established, in standard autogyro fashion. Behind the engine the fuselage of the PA-22 was conventional, with two side-by-side seats in a flat-sided cabin with generous glazing including windows for both upward and downward views. Access was via side doors. Its tail included a constant chord tailplane, mounted above the fuselage, which carried twin fins inboard of its rounded tips. In the early stages of this much modified airframe, the fins carried rudders as a precaution but experience of direct control allowed their removal. The PA-22 had a split axle, fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Its design was similar to that of many fixed wing and autogyro aircraft, with the axles and their rearward drag struts mounted on the central fuselage underside. Long shock-absorbing legs were attached to the upper fuselage. The front wheels were further forward than on other aircraft, making the fraction of weight on the tailwheel greater than usual. Because there was no wing lift involved, it was not necessary to lift the tail during take-off. All three tyres were pneumatic and the tailwheel was steerable. Another unusual feature of the PA-22 was its foldable rotor. Like other autogyros, the rotor blades were hinged to the drive shaft in the plane of the rotor. In flight, each blade's movement was limited to a few degrees by a pin but these could be removed and the blades folded back manually on the ground. With no wings, hangar space was minimized. The compact footprint when folded encouraged hopes for a roadable version. This emerged as the Autogiro AC-35, aerodynamically similar and with a foldable rotor but with a centrally-positioned engine. This drove a tractor propeller in flight via a long drive shaft and the tailwheel on the ground through another shaft. It did not reach production and most of Pitcairn's later aircraft had wings, though the PA-36 was an exception. Kellett Autogiro Company's slightly later wingless Kellett KD-1 autogyro had more commercial success.

It is a repository of the author's rambling thoughts, and some vital moral and spiritual conflicts. It provides many details about Govardhanram's life, giving some glimpses into his family life. Background upright=0.7 Govardhanram obtained his LLB degree in 1883 after repeated failures, and shifted to Mumbai in 1884 to practice as a pleader at high court. In January 1885, when he was 30, he started writing Scrap Book. He noted in it important points and quotations from books that he read from time to time. He wrote this diary till 3 November 1906, a few month before his death. Originally spanned in seven note-books, this works later edited by Kantilal Pandya, Sanmukhlal Pandya and Ramprasad Bakshi, and were published in three volumes during 1957 to 1959. It is believed that Govardhanram maintained a personal diary also which has not yet been traced. Bakshi published an abridged version of Scrap Book in Gujarati titled Govardhanram Ni Manannondh. Contents The notes in the Scrap Book include Govardhanram's personal comments on a wide range of subjects including his personal problems, his nature, emotions, ideals, the problem of his retiring from the active life, Sannyas and Yoga, family life and its problems, perception on the soul, God, life after death, virtue, immorality, bliss, astrology, own writings, and contemporary events. Reception In Tridip Suhrud's assessment Scrap Books was outstanding among Indian selfhood compositions that reelaborate on the themes and the quest of the medieval Bhakti tradition. For the first time, perhaps, we are given a vernacular version of the idea that the self is an experimental locus, where what is recorded, the outer and inner worlds, while fusing in the self can, simultaneously, be disentangled to create separate dimensions. The most exemplary modern expression of the paradox was, he added, M. K. Gandhi's autobiography. Scholars including Uttamlal Trivedi and Balwantray Thakore extensively used these notes while writing on Govardhanram.

The S&BC; operated between Republic, Grand Forks, British Columbia, and Lynch Creek, British Columbia. The line was locally known as the \\"Hot Air Line\\" in both the Boundary District of British Columbia and Republic due to the shaky nature of the company's financing and the grandiose nature of its publicity. The company was incorporated in 1900 in Republic and was bought out in 1901 by the Canadian Republic & Grand Forks Railway Company, who retained the Republic and Kettle Valley Railway name after the buy out. The company reorganized under the Spokane and British Columbia Railway name in 1905 which operated service on the line through 1919 and was officially stricken from the active corporation listing in 1925. Rolling stock In 1912, the company had three steam locomotives and a small inventory of rolling stock mostly geared towards mining and freight hauling. The S&BC; registered only two passenger-freight combination coaches in service, while having a fleet of four boxcars, ten ore dump cars and thirteen flatcars. All of the rolling stock was marked with S. & B.C. along with the car number, 100‚Äì104 for boxcars, 500‚Äì510 for ore dump cars, and 600‚Äì613 for flat cars. History The Republic & Kettle Valley Railway Company (R&KV;) was initially incorporated on August 8, 1900, with J. Stratton as president, upon acquisition by the rival Republic & Grand Forks Railway Company (R&GF;) which was formed in Grand Forks by Tracy Holland and Wylie Morris. Holland obtained permitting from the provincial government to build a rail line from Grand Forks south to the international border, and then with help from Morris permits to build south from the border to Republic. The initial financing was to be supplied by Hollands brother F. Holland along with funds from J. Stratton and T. Coffee all three being employees of the Toronto based Dominion Permanent Trust Company. On March 18, 1901, Morris obtained the needed permits from the Secretary of the Interior to build a Grand Forks to Republic rail line across the northern portion of the Colville Indian Reservation. Upon return from Washington, D.C. Morris worked with the R&GF; company to buy out the R&KV; company, after which the R&GF; Railway board relinquished the survey rights for the route. Organization of the R&KV; Company had been undertaken by Montreal business interests who were backing the Republic Mine on Republic and the company had secured permission for a rail line along the same route on May 8, 1900. The money needed to start building was advanced from Toronto by Stratton, Coffee, F. Holland, and an additional backer named Kleopher, all of the Dominion Permanent Trust. The company incorporated in Republic on August 8, 1900 with J. Stratton as president, and the first draft of route maps across the northern Colville Reservation were submitted for review on April 23, 1901. Review by a worker from the Crow, Flathead Commission assessed damage to already granted tribal allotments crossed by the proposed route. A check for the damages amounting to $5,548.05 was transmitted by Coffee, then vice president of the Republic & Kettle Valley Railway company to the Crow, Flathead Commission. Construction of the line between Danville, Washington, at the Canadian border and Republic was contracted to the Republic and Grand Forks Construction Company on May 28, 1901. The construction company, itself owned by Stratton and formed that same day, was considered by local press to be in essence the same company as the Republic and Kettle Valley company. The construction was disrupted by survey work and construction by the Washington and Great Northern Railway. Survey work by the Great Northern also commenced in 1901 while permits were not granted until July 13th, and the company was notified of survey, but not construction work, approval on July 18th. Notice was given to the Crow, Flathead Commission that some construction work on several allotments had already started. The final maps were transmitted to the commission on August 13, 1901 and review showed the proposed route paralleled closely, crossed, and in some sections used the same bed as the Republic and Kettle Valley railway. W. Morris acting as counsel for the R. & K.V. company lodged protest against the W&GN; with the commission, who ordered a temporary cessation of work by W&GN.; However the commission ruled in favor of the W&GN; company for the initial mapping and granted permission for them to resume building, while forcing the R&KV; to survey an updated route north. Due to the grandiose claims made by the company and the shaky financial dealing, the line was regionally known as the \\"Hot Air Line\\". Full operation began in 1902, with a Grand Forks band travelling to Republic to celebrate the increased ease of commerce between the towns. The rail line paralleled the Great Northern spur line from Republic through Malo and Curlew, Washington to Danville. The northern was initially surveyed by the Republic and Kettle River company, but they were forced to build on higher ground beyond the Great Northern land boundaries. At the border, the line leased rail access from the Kettle Valley Railway to connect to Grand Forks north of the border and then on another to Lynch Creek. Southern line On January 2, 1902, the railroad was also approved by the Secretary of the Interior to conduct surveying for a southern line though the Colville Reservation along the Sanpoil River. From the boundary of the reservation the railway located a line along the Columbia river and then up the Spokane River to a junction with the then defunct Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway road bed. Another juncture, with the Okanogan Electric Railway, was planned near Peach, after which the two would share the line into Spokane. The full extent of the line was a proposed route connecting Republic to Spokane, Washington. With the 1905 reorganization of the company into the Spokane and British Columbia Railway, an additional $4,000,000 in stocks was authorized for the southern line. However, as of a 1915 valuation by the US Commerce Commission, little actual building or prep work had been made on the southern route due to building debts, and none of the additional stocks had been issued. On June 30, 1915, the S&BC; had a total operating loss of $1,109,322.90 at the end of the 1915 fiscal year. Abandonment The final officially scheduled train run on the line was September 27, 1919, and only a few sporadic runs happened after that date, and the last run was in November 1919. The company officially filed a request to abandon its rail line with the Interstate Commerce Commission, with an advisory position held by the Public Service Commission of Washington. The commission held a hearing on January 20, 1921 to ascertain if there was any objection to the filed request or if any hardship would result on the region serviced by the rail line. It was concluded that the Great Northern was providing the needed service in the area and a final order by the hearing commission was made on February 2, 1921 by that the application should be granted. The line was listed as an active corporation in the Seventeenth Biennial Report of the Washington Secretary of State for 1920‚Äì1922, but was stricken from the Washington State Corporation records on July 1, 1925 in the Nineteenth Biennial Report.

To the south was a dock line. The station disappeared from Bradshaw in March 1848 but reappeared in April 1850. A second station opened in January 1881, rendering this one obsolete so it closed on 1 October 1881.  Second station  The second station opened as Overtown Waterloo in January 1881. It was located closer to Waterloo than Overtown, hence the name. It was renamed Overtown in 1886. There were no goods facilities but it had a footbridge and station buildings.

He made his top division debut in September 2020. He is the brother of active wrestler Hidenoumi, who is a former top division wrestler for Kise stable; they became the 18th pair of sekitori brothers in sumo history. Despite the fact that they are in different stables, Tobizaru will not face him in competition as Japan Sumo Association rules prevent close relatives from being matched against each other outside of playoff bouts. Career Masaya Iwasaki followed his elder brother Takuya into sumo, joining the same sumo club in his first year of elementary school. He was also interested in baseball, and had thoughts of becoming a professional baseball player, but gave up the game for sumo when he started junior high school. The future Hokutofuji was a contemporary of his at high school. He studied economics at Nihon University and was a member of their sumo team, but weighing only around 110 kg and having to sit out a year with an ankle injury he did not manage to win any major amateur titles. Deciding to turn professional, he opted not to join his brother who was already a sekitori at Kise stable, preferring the challenge of making his way on his own. Instead he joined Oitekaze stable, also home to End≈ç who was two years his senior at university. He made his debut in January 2015, competing under his family name of Iwasaki. Upon reaching the j≈´ry≈ç division after the May 2017 tournament he changed his shikona to Tobizaru (literally \\"Flying Monkey\\") as he was born in the year of the monkey and he considers his darting movement in the sumo ring similar to a monkey. He recorded only six wins and nine losses in his j≈´ry≈ç debut in July and was demoted back to makushita in September 2017. His 5‚Äì2 record at Makushita 2 in the September tournament would normally have been good enough for an immediate re-promotion, but there were only two openings and priority went to Takagenji and Takanosh≈ç. Tobizaru had to wait until the March 2018 tournament to return to j≈´ry≈ç, but he has maintained his sekitori status ever since. Tobizaru earned promotion to the top makuuchi division for the September 2020 tournament after a 9‚Äì6 record at J≈´ry≈ç 2 in July. He and Hidenoumi became the 11th pair of brothers to both have reached makuuchi. Tobizaru said he hoped his brother would be able to earn promotion back to makuuchi. He was also the tenth member of Oitekaze stable to reach makuuchi since its founding, the last being Tsurugish≈ç in September 2019. In his makuuchi debut he came close to becoming the first wrestler since Ry≈çgoku Kajinosuke II in 1914 to win the championship in his first top division tournament, needing to beat Sh≈çdai on the final day to force a playoff, but he was defeated and finished with a 11‚Äì4 record. He was awarded the Fighting Spirit prize. Fighting style Tobizaru is below the average size for an elite sumo wrestler, being the second lightest sekitori when he reached j≈´ry≈ç in 2017, and he stands just tall. He is an oshi-sumo specialist, preferring to push his opponents rather than grab the mawashi or belt. His likes to pull his opponents down at the edge of the ring, with a high percentage of his victories being by hataki-komi (slap down) and hiki- otoshi (pull down). He is also good at kicks and leg sweeps. His style is fast-paced, and he regularly sidestepped at the initial charge when in j≈´ry≈ç, but in his makuuchi debut made a conscious effort to fight more on the offensive.

Yeskel founded and ran, for 14 years, the Stonewall Center at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst; Yeskel also co-founded United for a Fair Economy and Class Action.  Early life  Felice Yeskel was born on April 6, 1953 and raised in Manhattan, the only child of Harry and Phyllis Yeskel. Yeskel was Jewish. Yeskel's father drove a truck to collect flour sacks from bakeries around New York City. Yeskel's first experiences of class difference began when she attended a program for \\"gifted children\\" at Hunter College Elementary School, with many economically privileged children. Yeskel understood that her working class family's apartment was much smaller than that of many of her classmates' and she experienced feelings of shame and confusion ‚Äî feelings that would inspire her later activism. Yeskel's first organizing efforts occurred while she was attending Seward Park High School; she worked to eliminate (and defeated) the dress code requirement that female students wear dresses to school. She graduated from Seward Park in 1970, a committed feminist and anti-war activist.  Education  Yeskel's activism continued at the University of Rochester, where she earned a B.A. in 1974. She moved to California for a time, working there with Harvey Milk against the anti-gay Briggs initiative. She then moved to the Philadelphia area and earned a Master's degree in Psychology in 1979. While in Philadelphia, Yeskel was involved with Movement for a New Society, which employed non-violent action to fight racism, sexism, classism, and more. After 1982, Yeskel was a leader of the Seneca Women's Peace Encampment at the same time she began working on her Ed.D. in Organizational Development at UMass Amherst, completing her degree in 1991.  Career = Stonewall Center  A number of homophobic incidents occurred on the UMass Amherst campus in 1984. Yeskel approached campus administration, armed with research undertaken or her dissertation, and convinced higher ups that the University did not adequately address the needs of its LGBTQ students. In 1985, Yeskel founded the Program for Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Concerns was created, with her as its director, a position she would hold for the next 14 years. The organization was nestled within the University's Office of Student Affairs. In 1995, the program was renamed The Stonewall Center: A Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, Queer, and Transgender Educational Resource Center, and in 2004, \\"asexual\\" and \\"intersex\\" were added to the name. The Center was the third of its kind in the nation on a college campus ‚Äî after similar centers founded at the University of Michigan and the University of Pennsylvania. The center was (and continues to be) a social hub for the campus, and provided education, brought speakers to campus, and community outreach.  Other ventures  During the 1990s, she was also part of the Diversity Works Project which ran workshops in area high schools aimed at fighting homophobia, sexism, racism, and classism. In 1995, Yeskel and Chuck Collins formed United for a Fair Economy. Together the two co-authored Economic Apartheid in America: A Primer on Economic Inequality and Insecurity. Yeskel's work with United for a Fair Economy brought recognition to issues of class. Yeskel founded, with fellow activist Jenny Ladd, the organization Class Action. In 1995, the pair brought together four people from upper-class backgrounds and four people from poor or working-class backgrounds, all involved in social change work, to meet in dialogue once a month for six hours. In 2001, this work expanded into workshops and more cross-class dialogue groups throughout Western Massachusetts. Yeskel and Ladd founded Class Action in 2004 in order to further expand this work and to \\"raise consciousness about the taboo topic of class and to address classism, both locally and nationally\\" Yeskel also served as a faculty member in the Social Justice Education Program at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.  Personal life  In 2004, Yeskel legally married her partner of many years, Felicia Mednick. The pair had previously married in the summer of 1997, though the union was not yet legal in the United States. Yeskel and Mednick had one daughter, Shira Ma'ayan.  Death  Felice Yeskel died on January 11, 2011, at the age of 57, after a two-year battle with cancer.
