The Rebels played in the Mountain West Conference and compete each season against the remaining eight members of the conference and one permanent interstate rival: Nevada. The Rebels played a 13-game schedule due to their non-conference road game at Hawaii. The Rebels also had non-conference games against Wisconsin and at Idaho and West Virginia. Bobby Hauck was in first season as the head coach of the Rebels football program, having previously coached at the University of Montana. The Rebels played their home games at Sam Boyd Stadium in Whitney, Nevada. The Rebels finished the season 2–11 (2–6 MW). Pre-season At the 2010 Mountain West Conference Media Day, UNLV was picked to finish eighth in the conference, due to their tough schedule which consisted of nine teams that went to bowl games in the previous season and included tough games with Wisconsin, at West Virginia, at Idaho, at Hawai'i and Nevada-Reno. Also at the Media Day, junior wide receiver Phillip Payne was voted to the preseason All- Mountain West Conference team, marking the fourth consecutive season that a UNLV wide receiver had been selected to the preseason All-MWC team. At the end of August 2010, linebacker Ronnie Paulo, safety Alex De Giacomo, offensive tackle Matt Murphy and center John Gianninoto were named as team captains for the 2010 season. Less than a week before the start of the season, first-year head coach Bobby Hauck announced that junior Mike Clausen had beat out senior incumbent Omar Clayton for the starting quarterback position and would start in the season opener against Wisconsin. Coaching changes On November 15, 2009, the Las Vegas Sun announced that Mike Sanford would be let go as head coach following the completion of the season on November 28, 2009. In five years as UNLV's head coach, Sanford posted a 16-43 overall record, a 7-32 record in the Mountain West and a 0-5 record against UNLV's arch rival, Nevada-Reno. Sanford's overall winning percentage of .271 was the second worst in the program's history, only Jeff Horton's .228 (13-44 in five years) was worse. Jerry Koloskie, at the time UNLV's interim athletic director, stated that Sanford's dismissal was a \\"performance-based issue\\" In Sanford's five seasons as head coach at UNLV, the team didn't have a single winning season, with their best records under Sanford's tenure being back-to-back 5-7 records in 2008 and 2009. On December 22, 2009, Sanford was hired by new Louisville head coach, Charlie Strong, to be Louisville's offensive coordinator. On December 22, 2009, newly hired athletic director, Jim Livengood, hired Montana head coach to become the tenth head coach in the program's history. Hauck and former head coach Dennis Franchione were interviewed for the vacant position, Hauck on December 20, 2009 and Franchione on December 21, 2009. Hauck would receive a second interview on December 22, 2009 to iron out contract negotiations. Hauck's contract was for three years which would be a three-year contract with a $350,000 annual salary and $150,000 in completion bonuses. Other coaches other than Hauck and Franchione that were rumored as candidates for the head coaching position were Jacksonville Jaguars defensive coordinator Dirk Koetter, Idaho's head coach Robb Akey and former Washington head coach Tyrone Willingham. On January 4, 2009, it was reported that six of Hauck's assistants from Montana would join his staff at UNLV, including former offensive coordinator Rob Phenicie and defensive coordinator Kraig Paulson who took the same positions with UNLV. Ty Gregorak was named recruiting coordinator and linebackers coach, Chad Germer (Offensive line), Dominic Daste (Tight Ends) and Cedric Cormier (Wide Receivers) were hired by Hauck as well. Utah defensive backs coach J.D. Williams was hired by Hauck to be his assistant head coach, pass defense coordinator and defensive backs coach. Currently, Hauck still has two vacant positions, but Hauck stated that filling those voids would not be an immediate priority. Recruiting Hauck met with most of the returning Rebels players within the first few days of his introduction as the new head coach and the players stated that they had quickly become fond of their new head coach. Within a month, Hauck was able to receive commitments from high school prospects in Southern Nevada, a problem that plagued Sanford during his tenure. Hauck was even able to get three star defensive end Ian Bobak who had originally committed to in-state rival UNR.

Deoxyribonucleic acid. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. eds. S.Draggan and C.Cleveland. Washington DC often abbreviated as cpDNA. It is also known as the plastome when referring to genomes of other plastids. Its existence was first proven in 1962. The first complete chloroplast genome sequences were published in 1986, Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) by Sugiura and colleagues and Marchantia polymorpha (liverwort) by Ozeki et al. Since then, hundreds of chloroplast DNAs from various species have been sequenced, but they are mostly those of land plants and green algae—glaucophytes, red algae, and other algae groups are extremely underrepresented, potentially introducing some bias in views of \\"typical\\" chloroplast DNA structure and content. Molecular structure The 154 kb chloroplast DNA map of a model flowering plant (Arabidopsis thaliana: Brassicaceae) showing genes and inverted repeats. Chloroplast DNAs are circular, and are typically 120,000–170,000 base pairs long. They can have a contour length of around 30–60 micrometers, and have a mass of about 80–130 million daltons. Most chloroplasts have their entire chloroplast genome combined into a single large ring, though those of dinophyte algae are a notable exception—their genome is broken up into about forty small plasmids, each 2,000–10,000 base pairs long. Each minicircle contains one to three genes, but blank plasmids, with no coding DNA, have also been found. Inverted repeats Many chloroplast DNAs contain two inverted repeats, which separate a long single copy section (LSC) from a short single copy section (SSC). The inverted repeats vary wildly in length, ranging from 4,000 to 25,000 base pairs long each. Inverted repeats in plants tend to be at the upper end of this range, each being 20,000–25,000 base pairs long. The inverted repeat regions usually contain three ribosomal RNA and two tRNA genes, but they can be expanded or reduced to contain as few as four or as many as over 150 genes. While a given pair of inverted repeats are rarely completely identical, they are always very similar to each other, apparently resulting from concerted evolution. The inverted repeat regions are highly conserved among land plants, and accumulate few mutations. Similar inverted repeats exist in the genomes of cyanobacteria and the other two chloroplast lineages (glaucophyta and rhodophyceæ), suggesting that they predate the chloroplast, though some chloroplast DNAs like those of peas and a few red algae have since lost the inverted repeats. Others, like the red alga Porphyra flipped one of its inverted repeats (making them direct repeats). It is possible that the inverted repeats help stabilize the rest of the chloroplast genome, as chloroplast DNAs which have lost some of the inverted repeat segments tend to get rearranged more. Linear structure Chloroplast DNA has long been thought to have a circular structure, but some evidence suggests that chloroplast DNA more commonly takes a linear shape. Over 95% of the chloroplast DNA in corn chloroplasts has been observed to be in branched linear form rather than individual circles. Nucleoids Each chloroplast contains around 100 copies of its DNA in young leaves, declining to 15–20 copies in older leaves. They are usually packed into nucleoids which can contain several identical chloroplast DNA rings. Many nucleoids can be found in each chloroplast. Though chloroplast DNA is not associated with true histones, in red algae, a histone-like chloroplast protein (HC) coded by the chloroplast DNA that tightly packs each chloroplast DNA ring into a nucleoid has been found. In primitive red algae, the chloroplast DNA nucleoids are clustered in the center of a chloroplast, while in green plants and green algae, the nucleoids are dispersed throughout the stroma. DNA replication=Leading model of cpDNA replication Chloroplast DNA replication via multiple D loop mechanisms. Adapted from Krishnan NM, Rao BJ's paper \\"A comparative approach to elucidate chloroplast genome replication.\\" The mechanism for chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) replication has not been conclusively determined, but two main models have been proposed. Scientists have attempted to observe chloroplast replication via electron microscopy since the 1970s. The results of the microscopy experiments led to the idea that chloroplast DNA replicates using a double displacement loop (D-loop). As the D-loop moves through the circular DNA, it adopts a theta intermediary form, also known as a Cairns replication intermediate, and completes replication with a rolling circle mechanism. Replication starts at specific points of origin. Multiple replication forks open up, allowing replication machinery to replicate the DNA. As replication continues, the forks grow and eventually converge. The new cpDNA structures separate, creating daughter cpDNA chromosomes. In addition to the early microscopy experiments, this model is also supported by the amounts of deamination seen in cpDNA. Deamination occurs when an amino group is lost and is a mutation that often results in base changes. When adenine is deaminated, it becomes hypoxanthine. Hypoxanthine can bind to cytosine, and when the XC base pair is replicated, it becomes a GC (thus, an A → G base change). Over time, base changes in the DNA sequence can arise from deamination mutations. When adenine is deaminated, it becomes hypoxanthine, which can pair with cytosine. During replication, the cytosine will pair with guanine, causing an A → G base change. In cpDNA, there are several A → G deamination gradients. DNA becomes susceptible to deamination events when it is single stranded. When replication forks form, the strand not being copied is single stranded, and thus at risk for A → G deamination. Therefore, gradients in deamination indicate that replication forks were most likely present and the direction that they initially opened (the highest gradient is most likely nearest the start site because it was single stranded for the longest amount of time). This mechanism is still the leading theory today; however, a second theory suggests that most cpDNA is actually linear and replicates through homologous recombination. It further contends that only a minority of the genetic material is kept in circular chromosomes while the rest is in branched, linear, or other complex structures. Alternative model of replication One of the main competing models for cpDNA asserts that most cpDNA is linear and participates in homologous recombination and replication structures similar to bacteriophage T4. It has been established that some plants have linear cpDNA, such as maize, and that more still contain complex structures that scientists do not yet understand; however, the predominant view today is that most cpDNA is circular. When the original experiments on cpDNA were performed, scientists did notice linear structures; however, they attributed these linear forms to broken circles. If the branched and complex structures seen in cpDNA experiments are real and not artifacts of concatenated circular DNA or broken circles, then a D-loop mechanism of replication is insufficient to explain how those structures would replicate. At the same time, homologous recombination does not explain the multiple A → G gradients seen in plastomes. This shortcoming is one of the biggest for the linear structure theory. Gene content and protein synthesis The chloroplast genome most commonly includes around 100 genes which code for a variety of things, mostly to do with the protein pipeline and photosynthesis. As in prokaryotes, genes in chloroplast DNA are organized into operons. Introns are common in chloroplast DNA molecules, while they are rare in prokaryotic DNA molecules (plant mitochondrial DNAs commonly have introns, but not human mtDNA). Among land plants, the contents of the chloroplast genome are fairly similar—they code for four ribosomal RNAs, 30–31 tRNAs, 21 ribosomal proteins, and 4 RNA polymerase subunits, involved in protein synthesis. For photosynthesis, the chloroplast DNA includes genes for 28 thylakoid proteins and the large Rubisco subunit. In addition, its genes encode eleven subunits of a protein complex which mediates redox reactions to recycle electrons, which is similar to the NADH dehydrogenase found in mitochondria. Chloroplast genome reduction and gene transfer Over time, many parts of the chloroplast genome were transferred to the nuclear genome of the host, a process called endosymbiotic gene transfer. As a result, the chloroplast genome is heavily reduced compared to that of free-living cyanobacteria. Chloroplasts may contain 60–100 genes whereas cyanobacteria often have more than 1500 genes in their genome. Contrarily, there are only a few known instances where genes have been transferred to the chloroplast from various donors, including bacteria. Endosymbiotic gene transfer is how we know about the lost chloroplasts in many chromalveolate lineages. Even if a chloroplast is eventually lost, the genes it donated to the former host's nucleus persist, providing evidence for the lost chloroplast's existence. For example, while diatoms (a heterokontophyte) now have a red algal derived chloroplast, the presence of many green algal genes in the diatom nucleus provide evidence that the diatom ancestor (probably the ancestor of all chromalveolates too) had a green algal derived chloroplast at some point, which was subsequently replaced by the red chloroplast. In land plants, some 11–14% of the DNA in their nuclei can be traced back to the chloroplast, up to 18% in Arabidopsis, corresponding to about 4,500 protein-coding genes. There have been a few recent transfers of genes from the chloroplast DNA to the nuclear genome in land plants.  Proteins encoded by the chloroplast  Of the approximately three-thousand proteins found in chloroplasts, some 95% of them are encoded by nuclear genes. Many of the chloroplast's protein complexes consist of subunits from both the chloroplast genome and the host's nuclear genome. As a result, protein synthesis must be coordinated between the chloroplast and the nucleus. The chloroplast is mostly under nuclear control, though chloroplasts can also give out signals regulating gene expression in the nucleus, called retrograde signaling. Protein synthesis Protein synthesis within chloroplasts relies on an RNA polymerase coded by the chloroplast's own genome, which is related to RNA polymerases found in bacteria. Chloroplasts also contain a mysterious second RNA polymerase that is encoded by the plant's nuclear genome. The two RNA polymerases may recognize and bind to different kinds of promoters within the chloroplast genome. The ribosomes in chloroplasts are similar to bacterial ribosomes. RNA editing in plastids RNA editing is the insertion, deletion, and substitution of nucleotides in a mRNA transcript prior to translation to protein. The highly oxidative environment inside chloroplasts increases the rate of mutation so post-transcription repairs are needed to conserve functional sequences. The chloroplast editosome substitutes C -> U and U -> C at very specific locations on the transcript. This can change the codon for an amino acid or restore a non-functional pseudogene by adding an AUG start codon or removing a premature UAA stop codon. The editosome recognizes and binds to cis sequence upstream of the editing site. The distance between the binding site and editing site varies by gene and proteins involved in the editosome. Hundreds of different PPR proteins from the nuclear genome are involved in the RNA editing process. These proteins consist of 35-mer repeated amino acids, the sequence of which determines the cis binding site for the edited transcript. Basal land plants such as liverworts, mosses and ferns have hundreds of different editing sites while flowering plants typically have between thirty and forty. Parasitic plants such as Epifagus virginiana show a loss of RNA editing resulting in a loss of function for photosynthesis genes. Protein targeting and import The movement of so many chloroplast genes to the nucleus means that many chloroplast proteins that were supposed to be translated in the chloroplast are now synthesized in the cytoplasm. This means that these proteins must be directed back to the chloroplast, and imported through at least two chloroplast membranes. Curiously, around half of the protein products of transferred genes aren't even targeted back to the chloroplast. Many became exaptations, taking on new functions like participating in cell division, protein routing, and even disease resistance. A few chloroplast genes found new homes in the mitochondrial genome—most became nonfunctional pseudogenes, though a few tRNA genes still work in the mitochondrion. Some transferred chloroplast DNA protein products get directed to the secretory pathway (though many secondary plastids are bounded by an outermost membrane derived from the host's cell membrane, and therefore topologically outside of the cell, because to reach the chloroplast from the cytosol, you have to cross the cell membrane, just like if you were headed for the extracellular space. In those cases, chloroplast-targeted proteins do initially travel along the secretory pathway). Because the cell acquiring a chloroplast already had mitochondria (and peroxisomes, and a cell membrane for secretion), the new chloroplast host had to develop a unique protein targeting system to avoid having chloroplast proteins being sent to the wrong organelle. Cytoplasmic translation and N-terminal transit sequences Polypeptides, the precursors of proteins, are chains of amino acids. The two ends of a polypeptide are called the N-terminus, or amino end, and the C-terminus, or carboxyl end. For many (but not all) chloroplast proteins encoded by nuclear genes, cleavable transit peptides are added to the N-termini of the polypeptides, which are used to help direct the polypeptide to the chloroplast for import (N-terminal transit peptides are also used to direct polypeptides to plant mitochondria). N-terminal transit sequences are also called presequences because they are located at the \\"front\\" end of a polypeptide—ribosomes synthesize polypeptides from the N-terminus to the C-terminus. Chloroplast transit peptides exhibit huge variation in length and amino acid sequence. They can be from 20–150 amino acids long—an unusually long length, suggesting that transit peptides are actually collections of domains with different functions. Transit peptides tend to be positively charged, rich in hydroxylated amino acids such as serine, threonine, and proline, and poor in acidic amino acids like aspartic acid and glutamic acid. In an aqueous solution, the transit sequence forms a random coil. Not all chloroplast proteins include a N-terminal cleavable transit peptide though. Some include the transit sequence within the functional part of the protein itself. A few have their transit sequence appended to their C-terminus instead. Most of the polypeptides that lack N-terminal targeting sequences are the ones that are sent to the outer chloroplast membrane, plus at least one sent to the inner chloroplast membrane. Phosphorylation, chaperones, and transport After a chloroplast polypeptide is synthesized on a ribosome in the cytosol, ATP energy can be used to phosphorylate, or add a phosphate group to many (but not all) of them in their transit sequences. Serine and threonine (both very common in chloroplast transit sequences—making up 20–30% of the sequence) are often the amino acids that accept the phosphate group. The enzyme that carries out the phosphorylation is specific for chloroplast polypeptides, and ignores ones meant for mitochondria or peroxisomes. Phosphorylation changes the polypeptide's shape, making it easier for 14-3-3 proteins to attach to the polypeptide. In plants, 14-3-3 proteins only bind to chloroplast preproteins. It is also bound by the heat shock protein Hsp70 that keeps the polypeptide from folding prematurely. This is important because it prevents chloroplast proteins from assuming their active form and carrying out their chloroplast functions in the wrong place—the cytosol. At the same time, they have to keep just enough shape so that they can be recognized and imported into the chloroplast. The heat shock protein and the 14-3-3 proteins together form a cytosolic guidance complex that makes it easier for the chloroplast polypeptide to get imported into the chloroplast. Alternatively, if a chloroplast preprotein's transit peptide is not phosphorylated, a chloroplast preprotein can still attach to a heat shock protein or Toc159. These complexes can bind to the TOC complex on the outer chloroplast membrane using GTP energy. The translocon on the outer chloroplast membrane (TOC) The TOC complex, or translocon on the outer chloroplast membrane, is a collection of proteins that imports preproteins across the outer chloroplast envelope. Five subunits of the TOC complex have been identified—two GTP-binding proteins Toc34 and Toc159, the protein import tunnel Toc75, plus the proteins Toc64 and Toc12. The first three proteins form a core complex that consists of one Toc159, four to five Toc34s, and four Toc75s that form four holes in a disk 13 nanometers across. The whole core complex weighs about 500 kilodaltons. The other two proteins, Toc64 and Toc12, are associated with the core complex but are not part of it. =Toc34 and 33= Toc34 is an integral protein in the outer chloroplast membrane that's anchored into it by its hydrophobic C-terminal tail. Most of the protein, however, including its large guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding domain projects out into the stroma. Toc34's job is to catch some chloroplast preproteins in the cytosol and hand them off to the rest of the TOC complex. When GTP, an energy molecule similar to ATP attaches to Toc34, the protein becomes much more able to bind to many chloroplast preproteins in the cytosol. The chloroplast preprotein's presence causes Toc34 to break GTP into guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and inorganic phosphate. This loss of GTP makes the Toc34 protein release the chloroplast preprotein, handing it off to the next TOC protein. Toc34 then releases the depleted GDP molecule, probably with the help of an unknown GDP exchange factor. A domain of Toc159 might be the exchange factor that carry out the GDP removal. The Toc34 protein can then take up another molecule of GTP and begin the cycle again. Toc34 can be turned off through phosphorylation. A protein kinase drifting around on the outer chloroplast membrane can use ATP to add a phosphate group to the Toc34 protein, preventing it from being able to receive another GTP molecule, inhibiting the protein's activity. This might provide a way to regulate protein import into chloroplasts. Arabidopsis thaliana has two homologous proteins, AtToc33 and AtToc34 (The At stands for Arabidopsis thaliana), which are each about 60% identical in amino acid sequence to Toc34 in peas (called psToc34). AtToc33 is the most common in Arabidopsis, and it is the functional analogue of Toc34 because it can be turned off by phosphorylation. AtToc34 on the other hand cannot be phosphorylated. =Toc159= Toc159 is another GTP binding TOC subunit, like Toc34. Toc159 has three domains. At the N-terminal end is the A-domain, which is rich in acidic amino acids and takes up about half the protein length. The A-domain is often cleaved off, leaving an 86 kilodalton fragment called Toc86. In the middle is its GTP binding domain, which is very similar to the homologous GTP- binding domain in Toc34. At the C-terminal end is the hydrophilic M-domain, which anchors the protein to the outer chloroplast membrane. Toc159 probably works a lot like Toc34, recognizing proteins in the cytosol using GTP. It can be regulated through phosphorylation, but by a different protein kinase than the one that phosphorylates Toc34. Its M-domain forms part of the tunnel that chloroplast preproteins travel through, and seems to provide the force that pushes preproteins through, using the energy from GTP. Toc159 is not always found as part of the TOC complex—it has also been found dissolved in the cytosol. This suggests that it might act as a shuttle that finds chloroplast preproteins in the cytosol and carries them back to the TOC complex. There isn't a lot of direct evidence for this behavior though. A family of Toc159 proteins, Toc159, Toc132, Toc120, and Toc90 have been found in Arabidopsis thaliana. They vary in the length of their A-domains, which is completely gone in Toc90. Toc132, Toc120, and Toc90 seem to have specialized functions in importing stuff like nonphotosynthetic preproteins, and can't replace Toc159. =Toc75= Toc75 is the most abundant protein on the outer chloroplast envelope. It is a transmembrane tube that forms most of the TOC pore itself. Toc75 is a β-barrel channel lined by 16 β-pleated sheets. The hole it forms is about 2.5 nanometers wide at the ends, and shrinks to about 1.4–1.6 nanometers in diameter at its narrowest point—wide enough to allow partially folded chloroplast preproteins to pass through. Toc75 can also bind to chloroplast preproteins, but is a lot worse at this than Toc34 or Toc159. Arabidopsis thaliana has multiple isoforms of Toc75 that are named by the chromosomal positions of the genes that code for them. AtToc75 III is the most abundant of these. The translocon on the inner chloroplast membrane (TIC) The TIC translocon, or translocon on the inner chloroplast membrane translocon is another protein complex that imports proteins across the inner chloroplast envelope. Chloroplast polypeptide chains probably often travel through the two complexes at the same time, but the TIC complex can also retrieve preproteins lost in the intermembrane space. Like the TOC translocon, the TIC translocon has a large core complex surrounded by some loosely associated peripheral proteins like Tic110, Tic40, and Tic21. The core complex weighs about one million daltons and contains Tic214, Tic100, Tic56, and Tic20 I, possibly three of each. =Tic20= Tic20 is an integral protein thought to have four transmembrane α-helices. It is found in the 1 million dalton TIC complex. Because it is similar to bacterial amino acid transporters and the mitochondrial import protein Tim17 (translocase on the inner mitochondrial membrane), it has been proposed to be part of the TIC import channel. There is no in vitro evidence for this though. In Arabidopsis thaliana, it is known that for about every five Toc75 proteins in the outer chloroplast membrane, there are two Tic20 I proteins (the main form of Tic20 in Arabidopsis) in the inner chloroplast membrane. Unlike Tic214, Tic100, or Tic56, Tic20 has homologous relatives in cyanobacteria and nearly all chloroplast lineages, suggesting it evolved before the first chloroplast endosymbiosis. Tic214, Tic100, and Tic56 are unique to chloroplastidan chloroplasts, suggesting that they evolved later. =Tic214= Tic214 is another TIC core complex protein, named because it weighs just under 214 kilodaltons. It is 1786 amino acids long and is thought to have six transmembrane domains on its N-terminal end. Tic214 is notable for being coded for by chloroplast DNA, more specifically the first open reading frame ycf1. Tic214 and Tic20 together probably make up the part of the one million dalton TIC complex that spans the entire membrane. Tic20 is buried inside the complex while Tic214 is exposed on both sides of the inner chloroplast membrane. =Tic100= Tic100 is a nuclear encoded protein that's 871 amino acids long. The 871 amino acids collectively weigh slightly less than 100 thousand daltons, and since the mature protein probably doesn't lose any amino acids when itself imported into the chloroplast (it has no cleavable transit peptide), it was named Tic100. Tic100 is found at the edges of the 1 million dalton complex on the side that faces the chloroplast intermembrane space. =Tic56= Tic56 is also a nuclear encoded protein. The preprotein its gene encodes is 527 amino acids long, weighing close to 62 thousand daltons; the mature form probably undergoes processing that trims it down to something that weighs 56 thousand daltons when it gets imported into the chloroplast. Tic56 is largely embedded inside the 1 million dalton complex. Tic56 and Tic100 are highly conserved among land plants, but they don't resemble any protein whose function is known. Neither has any transmembrane domains.

He was governor of Giza from 2000 till 2004, and Kafr-El-Sheikh from 1996 till 2000. Abouelleil was born in the city of El-Minia, governorate of El-Minia on 24 December 1935 to a father engaged in journalism. He moved to Cairo in the early fifties and after completing his high school education at Al-Ibrahimiyya school, he enrolled in 1954 into the faculty of Law, Cairo University, graduating in 1958. He was appointed assistant to the public prosecutor and along the years ascended the career ladder to the become head of the Cairo Appeal's court and the Cairo and Giza Criminal and National Security court. He was subsequently appointed Chief Justice of the Giza Primary Court from 1992 till 1996. The Governor Years 1996-2004 During his years as a governor Mahmoud Abouelleil was a keen supporter of projects to improve infrastructure and public services and the development of industrial areas, as well as encouragement of investment opportunities in Kafr-el-Sheikh and Giza. Also notable during this period, was shedding the spotlight on the Bahariya Oasis region. These efforts culminated in the presidential decision to allocate 20,000 feddan for agricultural, industrial and tourism development in accordance with environmental considerations in this promising area. Minister of Justice 2004-2006 Several important events occurred during Counsellor Mahmoud Abouelleil's years as minister of justice. Presidential elections took place for the first time in the history of Egypt. This occurred in the midst of several changes to the constitution and other fundamental political laws. In particular, the \\"Judiciary Power Law\\" which had been demanded by judges for over twenty years, finally saw the light in the form of several amendments in favour of judiciary independence. There was also a modification to the current law that deals with regulation of the media to provide new guarantees for freedom of speech and expression. This was law no. 47, 15 July 2006. Counsellor Mahmoud Abouelleil oversaw the parliamentary elections in 2005 by heading the electoral committee in which in the first stage the elections witnessed an unprecedented success of independent candidates. Before the elections Counsellor Mahmoud Abouelleil issued a statement in his capacity as head of the electoral committee guaranteeing that the judiciary observation of the elections would be comprehensive and impartial. This however was not allowed to occur in the second and third stages of the elections which resulted in a crisis forming between the judges group and the state. The judges made their demands clear in terms of independence of the judiciary from the state, and the guarantee of fair and impartial elections. Counsellor Mahmoud Abouelleil sided with the judges and in an historic publication from the ministry of justice he indicated his support of independent judiciary. This was published on June 8, 2005 and was sent to Egypt's highest judiciary board. Dustur Newspaper, Tues 15 May 2007, Mahmoud Abouelleil, where are your days? Sout-el-umma Newspaper, Mon 12 February 2007 p10, The article was the first time the document had been published indicating that the state had forced Judge Mahmoud Abouelleil to leave because of his support of the judiciary and the demands of the judges' group. During this time, the ministry continued to support the different judges groups across the country, providing subsidised health care and financial support to the groups in Cairo, Alexandria and surrounding districts. The crisis between the judges group and the state continued, and it cast its shadow over the two years during which Counsellor Mahmoud Abouelleil was in this position. The continuation of the crisis made it difficult for Counsellor Mahmoud Abouelleil to continue his other political and administrative duties. He presented his resignation while indicating his continued vision and support for judiciary independence, and while making clear that his vision is one that cannot be realised in the current climate. His resignation was accepted ten days after it was presented and was followed by the presidential decision to honour him with the Republican Medal of the First Degree, one of Egypt's highest state honours.El-Arabi Newspaper Sun 3 September 2006, p1, The truth about Mahmoud Abouelleil's exit from the ministry of justiceAl-Ahrar Newspaper, Mon 4 September 2006, p10, Mahmoud Abouelleil quits his position with honourThe Judges' Magazine, Year 21, April- September 2006 p23-24 Counsellor Abouelleil died on 27 September 2011.

History Pennyhill Park Hotel The first historical reference to Pennyhill Park's land relates to when the site was used as a warning beacon point in the national defence against the Spanish Armada in 1588. The construction of the country house itself was started in 1849 by James Hodges, an accomplished civil engineer who would later manage the construction of Montreal's Victoria Bridge, the longest bridge in the world at the time. The buildings were improved in the 1880s to add in an orangery, and again in 1903 with Bath stonework. In 1935, then-owner Colin Goldsworthy Heywood developed the terracing of its formal gardens after being impressed by similar work at the Château de Villandry in France. The British government used Pennyhill Park's grounds and its accommodation buildings as lodging for military personnel in World War I (the land is five miles (8 km) from Royal Military Academy Sandhurst). This was mainly for commissioned officers. The country house opened its doors as a hotel in 1972. The residents James Hodges James Hodges (1814-1879) was a civil engineer and built Pennyhill in about 1849. He was born in 1814 in Queenborough, Kent. At an early age he became an apprentice in the building industry and soon turned to railway construction. He participated in ten important projects and became works manager of the South-Eastern Railway Company. After that, as Sir Samuel Morton Peto’s agent, he built suspension bridges at Norwich, Needham, and Somerleyton, accepted a post as engineer, and then undertook the construction of 50 miles of track for the Great Northern Railway.Dictionary of Canadian Biography, “James Hodges”.

The couple had no children. James’s brother John Oliver Hodges who was also a civil engineer married Louisa’s sister Harriet Humphrey in 1848 and it seems that these two families had a close association. In 1853 James and Louisa went to Canada and for the next seven years James directed the gigantic task of building a bridge (Victoria Bridge) over the St Lawrence near Montreal. He returned to England in 1860 but unfortunately Louisa died two years later in 1862. James went back to Canada for some time and during this time his brother John Oliver Hodges and his family lived at Pennyhill.England Census of 1871. James died in 1879 and the house was sold.

Mission Rabbi David Rosen, Rabbi She'ar Yashuv Cohen and Sheikh Abd al Salam Menasra, at the Religion and the Jewish Arab Conflict conference. The center's mission is to promote good relations between Jews and Arabs within Israel and to enhance peace between Israel and the Palestinians. These goals are pursued in three major interconnected spheres. First, as one of the research centers of the university the JAC coordinates between various faculties of the university – the humanities, social sciences, education, and law - interdisciplinary academic research on Jewish-Arab themes. The second sphere concerns campus life, initiating common activity, seminars and various projects between Jewish and Arab students. The third sphere is the public sphere. The JAC maintains contact with various organizations and NGO's in the field and organizes colloquiums, conferences and working groups aimed to support significant, productive discussion between Jewish and Arab politicians and representatives of the civil society in Israel and between Israelis and Palestinians. Activities The activities conducted by the JAC focus, among other things, on peace initiatives, human and civil rights, equality of women, education, and political, social, economical, cultural and religious aspects of Israel and the Middle East at large. The JAC works toward bridging gaps and forging meaningful and lasting ties between Jews and Arabs. Community outreach plays a central role in the work of the JAC as well.

Rassem Khamaisi, the Head of the Jewish- Arab center who talked about the connection between the Restorative justice and the Koran. The incoming President of the Haifa District Court the Honorable Judge Dr. Ron Shapiro gave a guest lecture. He described how the criminal legal system generally focuses on one tool almost exclusively. A punishment in response to social crime. The severity of the punishment reflects how severely society views the act committed by the accused. There are hardly any references in the criminal procedure relating to the victim or his needs, which are often only an apology or responsibility rather than punishment. The Restorative justice, which was designed to address these and other needs of victims of crime, while providing an opportunity to criminals to repair their ways, is receiving an ambivalent attitude from the courts in Israel. Some take the restorative justice process very lightly in consideration before sentencing; others see it as an indication of the rehabilitation of the defendant or the willingness of the victim to forgive. Dr. Shapira gave several examples of judgments given in references to restorative justice processes. In the conclusion, Dr. Shapiro emphasized the importance of referring to the restorative justice as a treatment tool and the need to add treatment tools to the law, like the restorative justice to the courts responds basket. JAC on campus The Jewish-Arab Center conducts various campus activities, such as: *Student Jewish-Arab Workshop: Multiculturalism, Conflict and Partnership. *Community Leadership *Together for the rehabilitation of the Carmel Forest *Breaking the Ice 2011 *The Haifa Interfaith ForumFor more information, see JAC's official site Scholarships and prizes The Werner Otto Scholarships are awarded annually by the Association of German Friends of the University of Haifa to outstanding female Arab students engaged in graduate studies, as part of the effort to empower women. The Otto Werner Scholarships were awarded for the first time in 2001. Since then, more than 100 women have received the scholarships. The recipients are outstanding students who are also dedicated to social and educational activities in their communities, and act as advocates for many important issues and as role models for other women. Starting this year, JAC have an alumni network working on community projects, which JAC believe will bear fruit in the coming years. JAC's alumni have continued on to PhDs, post- doctoral fellowships and academic careers; have risen to managerial positions in the public sector; and have attained professional success in the private sector. JAC is very proud of their accomplishments and believe that their example will inspire other women. Encouraging trends are appearing already: more and more women are applying for the scholarships; their fields of study are varied and not necessarily what some might consider traditionally feminine; and many more Arab women are not content to complete MA degrees, but also continue on to PhD studies. Research The current 2017 research projects at the JAC are: *The Growth of the Middle Classes and its impact on the Management of Arab Local Authorities (Prof. Rassem Khamaisi) Local government is an important focus subject for research being that it is a part of the governance and management system of local citizens' lives. The central government's avoidance from supplying a basket of services and infrastructure to the citizen, and their transfer to the responsibility and authority of the local government, led to the strengthening of local and municipal citizenship. In addition, it caused the political and administrative leadership to become a central component in the level of development of a locality and the supply of quality services to citizens. This study is intended to deal for the first time, with the process of change in the Arab communities a process of middle class growth that constitutes more than a third of the population of the localities. In this study, prof. Khamaisi will examine how the middle class influences the characterization of candidates for leadership and leaders in local authorities and will try to draw guidelines in order to cope with the Arabs new reality of growing middle class in the localities. *Obtaining planning space Justice through implementation of a Reparcelation (unification and distribution) mechanism in the Arab localities (Prof. Rassem Khamaisi) The study exposes the nature of the relationship between real estate policy versus planning policy and taxation policy in the reality of the transition from agrarian to urban society, and the transition from a normative approach to the land to economic relations as a result of the granting of planning rights that enable direct development. The study includes a discussion on the form of democratization in the planning process, which is the result of decentralizing the planning system with the implementation of the reform in the planning system. At the same time, the research will have an applied contribution that will be presented by guidelines and a toolbox detailing how to implement the mechanism of consolidation and division, in order to correct distortions between private owners and between private landowners and the state. *Water Authority Research (Prof. Rassem Khamaisi) The domestic and urban water and sewage sector consumes more than 40% of the country's freshwater consumption, and is a central component in the management of the national water economy. The ongoing urbanization process and the constant increase in the standard of living, which increase demand for water, reinforce the importance of optimal, efficient, reliable and policy-oriented management that will ensure regular, reliable and quality water and sanitation supplies while achieving public benefits. The goals of the study are to examine the performance measures that were required from the corporations with their establishment and over the years, and to formulate performance indicators that will better serve both the corporations and the regulator, by studying the global experience on the subject and the needs of both sides. Publications The center's publication during 2015-2017 *Study Report: Testing government policy towards the Arab community and the work of Arab local authorities Final report that maps the main barriers which stand before a social- economic development of Arab authorities. The research team included: Prof. Itai Send, Issachar Rosen- Zvi, Prof. Rassem Khamaisi, CPA. Ziad Abu hableh. *Branding Acre as a shared space The document presents a strategic marketing plan for the city of Acre as a shared space between Arabs and Jews, and as an extension to the existing branding plan of Acre as a hub of Mediterranean cultures. Acre's past and present as a shared space among different cultures and religions are a major opportunity for boosting the city's image. The document was edited by Prof. Eli Abraham and Dr. Eran Ketter. *Al- Karmil The book includes articles from the Arabic literature which interpret the reality of life for Arabs and tests them through literary works. This collection of articles deals with the concept of \\"Dreams\\" and how it's presented in the Arabic literature. This 36 book volume was edit by Ibrahim Taha. *Still Playing by the Rules Index of Arab –Jewish relations in Israel 2013 by Sammy Smooha. The findings of the research indicate the attitudes of the Arab and Jewish public towards each other. The index is part of a wide project that includes two surveys that are conducted every year since 2003. One survey is based on 700 face to face interviews with Arab elderlies (including Druze and Bedouin) and a survey that is based on 700 telephone interviews with Jewish elderlies (including immigrants, kibbutz members, and settlers). This index it's the only scientific tool in Israel which examines every year in the same method the attitudes of Jewish and Arab towards each other and towards the country and tests change trends over time. *Between social and real estate values: the housing market among Arab citizens in Israel A research by Prof. Rassem Khamaisi, head of the Jewish- Arab center and a researcher in the department of geography and environmental studies .

The study addresses the question whether representatives are always committed to their constituents and are freely elected by them. This issue of representation is extensive, encompassing various aspects of citizens' lives. At the decision –making level, in public administration, identity, cultural, economic aspects and more. The research addresses concisely samples of issues and points out the need for future comprehensive study on mixed cities. *The Palestinians in Israel: Historical, Sociological and Political Research Mursi Abu Mouk's book on the history, sociology, and politics of the Palestinian population in Israel. The book presents points in the Palestinian past that explain the situation of this population and describes the formative events that have created and established its status till this day. *Environmental demographic and economic factors that influence the real estate rates in Acre The housing and real estate issue is at the heart of every public, social and economic discussion around the country. The stiff prices of housing are the result of the existing-limited supply that straggles to meet the growing and suitable demand pressures in popular places. This difficulty also applies in mixed cities, including Acre and her surroundings. This book by Nasser Khair and Prof. Boris A. Portnov deals with the environmental, demographic and economic factors that influence the real estate rates in Acre. *Living together in a diverse campus This paper summarizes the research that was carried out over the past three years in the University campus. The study was initiated by the Jewish-Arab Center and focused on the question of whether or not an academic institute has the ability to adapt itself to students from diverse groups, and specifically to students from the Arab society, which constitutes a relatively large minority on campus and in Israel. The study analyzed the academic campus in the context of inequality and conflict between national / ethnic communities and examined how the two communities, Jewish and Arab, occupy the campus, a space they are forced or choose to share. *Two banks to the wadi The book of Riad Kabha, born in 1953, is a resident of Barta'a, a graduate of Tel Aviv University, teacher and educator, Mukhtar, head of the Sama Council (2005-2009) and director of the Jewish-Arab Center for Peace in Givat Haviva.

This study exposes the types of functional relations between a minority and a majority in the central metropolitan area in Israel and examines the level of tolerance of the communities and the spatial cooperation. The Druze section In the early 1970s, the Druze section, including the Druze Archive, was integrated into the JAC. The Druze section is headed by Prof. Kais Firro of the department of Middle East History. A major task of the Druze section is to study, preserve and present Druze history, tradition and culture. Since its establishment, the archive has become an international source of information on Druze culture and tradition. It contains one of the finest collections of its kind in the Middle East, including books, periodicals and chronicles acquired from archives all over the world. Another key goal is education for the Druze and the advancement of young leadership. Meetings are organized between the Druze public and academic and military figures, in order to engender ideas for shared projects and to resolve conflicts and problems. In 2005, several meetings of Druze ex-army officers were held, in which critical issues among the Druze population were discussed, and solutions such as taking responsibility and creating a climate for change within the public and in the government's attitude were offered. One decision was to establish a task force from different sectors that would focus on specific issues. Staff The Head of the JAC is Professor Rassem Khamaisi.

Life He was born at Stroud, Gloucestershire, on 2 June 1698. He was educated for the dissenting ministry, probably in London. His first settlement was at Lower Tooting, Surrey, where he succeeded Francis Freeman (died 17 November 1726), a Presbyterian. Miles was at this time an Independent (congregationalist). He was ordained in 1731. In 1737, still retaining his Tooting charge, he became assistant to Samuel Chandler, at the Old Jewry meeting-house. From this time he was counted as a Presbyterian. He held the double appointment till 1744, and for the rest of his life was minister at Tooting only, having John Beesley as his assistant from 1756. In 1743 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1744 he received the degree of D.D. from the University of Aberdeen. To his pulpit work, for thirty years, he devoted two days a week, rising between two and three in the morning to write his sermons. He was a friend of Daniel Neal, and Nathaniel Lardner, and a correspondent of Philip Doddridge, to whom he sent some criticisms of his Family Expositor. He died on 10 February 1763. His funeral sermon was preached by Philip Furneaux. Legacy His widow, Emma Miles (died 1790), by deeds of 6 October 1763 and 15 February 1766, settled an endowment of £500 on the ministry at Tooting, and conveyed the meeting-house to trustees for the use of Dissenters of \\"the presbyterian or independent denomination.\\" In 1880 the property became the subject of a chancery suit, which was decided on 1 March 1888 in favour of the Independents. Works His communications to the Philosophical Transactions extend from 1741 to 1753, and relate to natural history, meteorology, and electricity, in which he made new experiments. He gave assistance to Thomas Birch in his edition (1744) of the works of Robert Boyle.

He is the first MacLeod chief to which heraldry can be assigned. Clan tradition states that he was a minor at the time of his father's death and for six years an incompetent guardian led the clan to its lowest point in clan history. After reaching the age of maturity, Iain Borb managed to acquire some of the clan's lost lands and led his clan and his kinsmen (the MacLeods of Lewis) in the Battle of Harlaw, in 1411. Iain Borb was wounded in the head during the conflict; the wound never completely healed and confined him to his home on Pabbay for much of his life. Tradition states that he died when this wound re-opened during a fencing/wrestling match. There is some disagreement as to which of his sons was the eldest; however, his son William Dubh was the one who finally succeeded to the chiefship, following his death in 1442. Life Iain Borb was the son, and successor of William Cleireach, fifth chief of Clan MacLeod. According to the Bannatyne manuscript, he was only ten years old at the time of his father's death. The manuscript relates how during his minority a guardian was chosen to lead the clan. This man's name was Iain Mishealbhach ('John the Unlucky') who was a cousin of the young Iain Borb. During Iain Mishealbhach's tenure as guardian, the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan were at their lowest point in their history. Many of the clan opposed the selection of Iain Mishealbhach, favouring instead Tormod Coil who slew Alastair Cannoch at the Battle of Sligachan. Tormod Coil defied the guardian and seized part of the lands of Glenelg. The manuscript continues that the during this era, the MacDonalds took full advantage of the disorderedness of the MacLeods. A force of MacDonalds landed at Sleat and took possession of the castles of Dunscaith and Camus and in the process drove the MacLeods out of Sleat. They also invaded North Uist and fought the MacLeods at Cailus, where the MacLeods were completely defeated and further lands were gained by the invaders. Following these victories, the MacDonalds besieged Dunvegan Castle, where the widow of William Cleireach was living at the time. The chief of the MacLeods of Lewis, however, came in force and relieved the castle, defeating the MacDonalds at Fiorlig. Torquil then took the family to Lewis where they remained until Iain Borb reached the age of maturity. Pabbay, Harris, where Iain Borb spent much of his life and where he died in 1442. Iain Borb's first act as chief, according to the manuscript, was to hang Iain Mishealbhach, confiscate the dead man's lands, and banish his family. Later, Iain Borb made an agreement with Domhnall, Lord of the Isles, in which the MacDonalds gave back the lands they won from the MacLeods--except the lands on North Uist. Iain Borb swore his vassalage to the Lord of the Isles and in accordance to this agreement fought under the MacDonalds at the Battle of Harlaw in 1411. During the battle, Iain Borb commanded all the MacLeods (including the MacLeods of Lewis) and the manuscript states that the MacLeods had the honour of fighting on the right of Domhnall's forces. Early 20th century Clan Donald historians A. and A. Macdonald, however, stated that both clans of MacLeods were in the main body of men commanded by Domhnall and that the right wing was made up of MacLeans, commanded by Hector MacLean of Duart (Red Hector of the Battles). The manuscript states how Iain Borb was wounded in the head during the conflict. The wound never entirely healed and for the rest of his life it would bleed whenever he became agitated. For the most part, Iain Borb lived at his castle on Pabbay, where he renovated and enlarged the fortress there. The manuscript tells how during a fencing match with his foster-brother, Somerled MacConn, Iain Borb's wound began to bleed so profusely that he bled to death. choir of Iona Abbey. The stone said to represent a MacLeod is visible on the floor in the middle. The effigy on the left (north) is of a Mackinnon, the one on the right is a Mackenzie. The Bannatyne manuscript states that the first seven chiefs of Clan MacLeod were buried at Iona. The choir of Iona Abbey, for the most part, dates from the early 16th century. Within the centre of the choir there is a large stone which once contained a monumental brass, traditionally said to have been a MacLeod. The stone formed a matrix which at one time contained the brass inlay (tradition states it was a silver inlay). It is the largest carved stone on the island, measuring by . R.C. MacLeod speculated that perhaps the clan's founder, Leod, and five of his successors were buried beneath--however, in his opinion the fourth chief, Iain Ciar, was buried elsewhere. Issue The Bannatyne manuscript records that Iain Borb married a granddaughter of the Earl of Douglas. Several 20th-century clan historians named her Margaret. The couple had two sons, named William and Norman (Tormod), as well as two daughters. The manuscript maintains that Norman was the elder of the brothers, but that he died young and left a young son who was too young to succeed to the chiefship. In fact, William Dubh succeeded Iain Borb as chief of the clan. R.C. MacLeod considered the fact that the clan considered William chief and not guardian was evidence that William was in fact the elder brother. A. Morrison stated that Norman was probably an illegitimate son of Iain Borb and that he was considerably older than William, since Norman led the clan in battle in 1428. According to Morrison, Norman was killed in 1429 and that his posthumous son was the progenitor of the MacLeods of Waternish. D. MacKinnon stated that he led the MacLeods and was slain at the battle in Lochaber in 1429, supporting Alexander, Lord of the Isles against James I. MacKinnon stated that he married a daughter of Chisholm of Strathglass, and by her had his son, John. Morrison stated that Iain Borb's daughters were both born in wedlock. According to MacKinnon, one of the daughters, Margaret, married Roderick MacLeod of Lewis (6th clan chief). MacLeod stated that the other daughter married Lachlan MacLean, of Duart (7th chief of Clan MacLean). The late 19th-century clan historian A.M. Sinclair stated that her name was Finvola and noted that the couple had two sons, Neil and John Garbh. However, several years earlier another late 19th century Clan MacLean historian, J.P. MacLean named Lachlan's wife as \\"Fionnaghal, daughter of William MacLeod of Harris\\". Heraldry Iain Borb is the earliest MacLeod chief to which heraldry can be assigned. The coat of arms of the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan appear in the mid 15th century roll of arms Armorial de Berry (although the armorial actually lists the arms as those of \\"Le sire de bes\\"). The blazon is: azure, a castle triple-towered argent. The castle may represent the seat of the chiefs--Dunvegan Castle, located on Skye.

The movie won the Audience Choice Award at the Chicago Latino Film Festival and a Special Mention in the Havana Film Festival.  Plot  The movie opens as the two protagonists, Rodrigo and Rocco join their families to hold a birthday party for their grandfather, Rodrigo Carnicero, which through most of the movie is only referred to as \\"El abuelo\\" (Spanish for Grandpa). Rodrigo is a regular middle-class teenager, while Rocco (who, in fact, is also named Rodrigo but shortens his name to Rocco) is rather more unconventional, a marijuana user and writer for an independent magazine, and has deep conflicts with his father Luis. Despite being cousins and the best efforts of the grandfather, Rodrigo and Rocco have a troubled relationship and are constantly harsh to each other. During the meal, the boys' parents (the sons of Carnicero) talk about the grandfather's will and the upcoming marriage of Luis. After a furious fight with Luis, Carnicero suffers a heart attack and dies. After Carnicero's death, the family goes into conflict about the terms of his will, which grants money to a longtime friend even when Luis and his brother claim he does not have a right to anything as he is not related to Carnicero, the fact that Rodrigo inherited his grandfather's car, and the expenses of running the big house where he lived. After a funeral mass, held despite the desire Carnicero stated in his will, Rocco realizes his father and uncles are not willing to fulfill the other petition on the will: to have his ashes thrown into the sea at sunrise, in Acapulco, and decides to do it on his own. After stealing Rodrigo's car, Rocco talks his cousin into joining him in the trip. Despite the movie title, they do not drive by the free highway but by the autopista, where they have to pay tolls. By the time they arrive in Acapulco, they're almost out of money. Then starts a recurring event in the movie, where the boys spin the funerary urn to solve a disagreement, under the idea of \\"letting grandpa choose\\", in this case, to decide whether visiting Rodrigo's girlfriend Irina or Grandpa's friend Felipe to borrow money. The outcome leads them to visit Felipe in his restaurant, where they get a loan and Rocco notices an attractive girl who just left a bunch of flyers advertising a hotel. Rocco takes one of the flyers and they rent a room in the hotel. Then they disagree about the plans for the night: Rodrigo wants to go a disco with Irina and Rocco wants to take the ashes to a cantina. The urn-spinning game is used again to decide, and Rodrigo wins. As he is leaving with Irina, he convinces Rocco (who does not have a date) to invite the girl from the hotel, Maria, to the disco. There, Rocco gets bored as he cannot dance, and out of boredom tastes the ashes, which makes Rodrigo take the urn to the dance floor where it gets misplaced. After recovering the urn, he and Maria go to a coffee shop and talk, discovering they have a lot in common and like each other. Returning to the hotel, they have sex. At the same time, Rodrigo and Irina get back from the disco, but they find the hotel room locked and neither of them has money to rent another. They decide to have sex in Rodrigo's car, but are caught by the police and Rodrigo is arrested. He calls Rocco, who uses his remaining money to bribe an officer and take him out of detention. By then, it's morning, so the boys take the urn and go to the beach, but they find out the ashes have been replaced by corn chips. They engage in a fight, each blaming the other for the loss, and return to the disco to search for the ashes, but there the garbage has already been thrown out. In Mexico City, Rodrigo and Rocco's Aunt, Pureza, discovers the ashes are missing. She and Rodrigo's father (also named Rodrigo) leave Mexico City right away to Acapulco, while Luis stays in Mexico City. Back in the hotel room, Rocco discovers a small amount of grey powder on the floor, which he claims tastes like the ashes, and both deduce Maria has taken them, as she stayed in the room while Rocco was getting Rodrigo out of jail. At Maria's house, right next to the hotel, they look at her family pictures and discover Maria is Rodrigo Carnicero's illegitimate daughter, and therefore their aunt. She confronts them and refuses to give back the ashes, forcing them to leave, and then at request of her mother, Perla (who had been Carnicero's lover) explains to her what happened. Maria and Perla decide to bury the ashes (stolen by Maria in a corn chip bag, which is why the corn chips were in the urn) in their garden, but on second thought, divide them in two, and decide to bury one half in the garden and give the other to the boys so they can throw it in the sea. Out of rage and shocked by the revelation, Rodrigo slams the car he inherited from his grandfather, but he and Rocco end up coming to terms with Perla and Maria's decision and accept the half they are given. Rocco gives Maria a watch (left to him by Carnicero in his will, and named as his most beloved possession) and they kiss again, despite knowing they are related, while Rocco builds a warm friendship with Perla. Knowing the visit to Acapulco has been quite eventful, and fearing they'll lose the rest of the ashes, they spin the urn one last time, to decide whether to throw the ashes on sunrise or sunset. Sunset wins. On the dock, Rocco, Rodrigo and Maria meet with Pureza and Rodrigo Sr., but his father fights with Rodrigo about the almost destroyed car, only to discover Rodrigo has matured and stands up to him. Finally, he stays on the dock, and only the three youths and Pureza board the ship. Pureza sees that Maria has the watch, deducing the relation between her and her father, and Rodrigo and Rocco are shown to have built a bond, supporting each other. The movie closes when all four say goodbye to Carnicero and throw the ashes.  Cast and characters  Osvaldo Benavides as Rodrigo Carnicero Esquivel, shortened Rocco, one of the two lead characters. He's a pre-university student, and says he wants to study archeology or philosophy. He also claims to have forced his mother to leave home, after he found her cheating on his father, but it's never clearly stated if it's true or made-up, although he says that for a time he thought it was his fault. He writes for an independent magazine and is a regular marijuana user. Rodrigo Cachero as Rodrigo Carnicero Martínez, the other lead character, who goes by the name Rodrigo. He's much more conventional than Rocco. He has a steady girlfriend, Irina, and is also a pre-university student. Ana de la Reguera as Maria, Carnicero's illegitimate daughter and Rocco's love interest. Despite being offered a scholarship to study oceanography in Baja California, she's willing to turn it down in order to help her mother run a hotel. Otto Sirgo as Rodrigo Sr., Rodrigo's father. He's depicted as an imposing father, always trying to force his will on his son, despite Rodrigo's wishes. Rodrigo states his father always treats him like a child. Pilar Ixquic Mata (Credited as Pilar Mata) as Pureza, addressed during the movie as Puri, Carnicero's daughter. She never married in order to take care of her parents, but at Carnicero's funeral mass, she accidentally manages to meet a man. By the end of the movie she announces she's pregnant. Alejandro Tomasi as Luis, Rocco's father. Of all the boy's parents and uncles, he's the one depicted in the most negative light, shown as greedy, completely uncaring of what his father or son want, and only concerned with his impending wedding. He's said to have gone through many unsuccessful marriages, each time increasing the age disparity between him and his wives (Carnicero says that Rocco's stepmothers are closer to Rocco's own age each time). When Pureza discovers that the ashes are missing, he's the only one of the sons of Carnicero who does not go to Acapulco, only wishing Pureza and Rodrigo Sr. a nice trip. Gina Morett as Perla, Carnicero's lover and Maria's mother. Years before the events depicted in the movie, she worked as a chef at Felipe's restaurant, where she met Carnicero and got involved with him, and later left to start running a hotel on her own. She's a great cook. Alexia Witt as Irina, Rodrigo's girlfriend. She seems to be from a higher social class than the other youths in the movie, as she drives her own car (the only other teenager with a car of his own is Rodrigo, and he inherited it), and her family either spend summers in Acapulco or have a house there. Héctor Ortega as Felipe, Carnicero's longtime friend. Like Carnicero, he's a Spanish expatriate living in Mexico. He owns a restaurant in Acapulco, and is aware of Carnicero's affair with Perla, something he kept secret for over twenty years. In Carnicero's will, he inherits an undisclosed amount of money, presumably destined for Maria and Perla. Xavier Massé as Rodrigo Carnicero, a Spanish doctor living in Mexico as an expatriate. He's Rodrigo's and Rocco's grandfather. He dies the day of his 75th birthday, and his wish to have his ashes thrown to Acapulco's sea starts the main plot of the movie. As he asked to be cremated without any religious ceremony, he's likely an atheist. He had three children and four grandchildren from his marriage, and a daughter from his affair with Perla.

An illustrative and long career army and intelligence officer, Kiani came into limelight when he had served as Director-General of the Pakistan Army's Military Intelligence and the commander of the X Corps. Having remembered as an upright and an honest officer during his military career, Kiani had served as a chairman of Federal Public Service Commission during the General Musharraf's regime and had to leave when he and the then Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz developed differences. Biography=Early life and military service Jamshed Gulzar Kiani was born in 20 July 1944 in Bombay, British India. He was educated at the Gordon College before accepting at the military academy. He attended and graduated from the Pakistan Military Academy in the class of 38th PMA Long Course, and gained commissioned in the Baloch Regiment as 2nd Lt. in 1964. He participated in the second war with India, leading a platnoon, and later joined the ISI as an intelligence officer. In 1969–71, Captain Kiani was stationed in Dacca, East Pakistan as an ISI analyst, joining the GHQ Dhaka of the Eastern Command led by its commander, Lieutenant-General A.A.K. Niazi. During this time, Capt. Kiani developed serious problems on the military strategy led by General Niazi, publicly disagreeing with him over the law and order issue, specifically in regards to the intelligence based on the air operations led by the Indian IAF and Indian Navy in East. Capt. Kiani fought against the Indian Army on the eastern border but due to his objections on General Niazi's and his staff, he was recalled to back to Pakistan, avoiding becoming prisoner of war. In interview given to Dr. Shahid Masood, Kiani had famously called that: \\"General Niazi was a total and abject failure general who had no control over the situation.\\" Recalling his memories from East, Kiani quoted that \\"General Niazi totally failed in East Pakistan and his role was very embarrassing which is a matter of regret.\\" While in East, Capt. Kiani was confided with the information from the U.S.Consulate-General in Dhaka that the 7th Fleet had been deployed for Pakistani soldiers' relieve and retreat. However, the 7th Fleet never arrived due to Soviet Union's Pacific Fleet began trailing the American fleet, making it unable to assist in Pakistani defense. About the surrender of Eastern Command, Kiyani said: our soldiers fought diligently and bravely but it was the military leadership that failed in East, not soldiers. In 1972, he was promoted as Major, continuing his service with the ISI in Karachi, where he worked on the classified assignments covering the security and intelligence management. In 1980s, he went to attend the National Defence University (NDU) and graduated with MSc in War studies before posting back to the Military Intelligence (MI) where Colonel Kiani worked with then-Brigadier Pervez Musharraf on Siachen mission helping him to secure two intermediate posts, Bilafond La in Siachen Glacier. In 1990s, Brig. Kiani held the command of the 111th Infantry Brigade in Rawalpindi, as his one-star assignment before being promoted as Major-General in 1996–97. Kargil debacle and X Corps In 1999, Major-General Kiani was the Director-General of the Military Intelligence when the Kargil fiasco took place with the Indian Army. When India mounted counter-attacks on Pakistani forces incursion in the Kargil sector, Major-General Kiani prepared presentation and briefed then-Prime minister Nawaz Sharif, which according to him, had nothing to do with Kargil conflict, on 12 March 1999. During the event from May to July 1999, Major- General Kiani had given presentation to Joint Chiefs Staff Committee every single week on the conflict, and had given presentation to Prime minister only three times on the conflict. Major-General Kiani's career remained hidden in the public until coming to the public notice when the news media identified him as the GOC-in-C of the X Corps, when the military takeover took place in October 1999. During the interview with Shahid Masood in Geo News, Kiani clarified his role by stating that he was the major-general during the coup d'état and was promoted to three-star assignment on 1 November 1999. Lieutenant-General Kiani took over the command of the X Corps from the outgoing Lieutenant-General Mahmud Ahmed, which he led until 2001. Lieutenant- General Kiani attended the meeting Chief of Army Staff General Pervez Musharraf regarding the terrorist attacks in New York, United States where he, along with others, dissented from the war on terror policy. About the decision of supporting the United States, General Kiani maintained in 2008: \\"The corps commander is a professional soldier and ignoring his advice leads to losses.\\" In 2001, General Kiani was removed from his field command assignment and was posted in the Army GHQ in Rawalpindi as an Adjutant-General, which he served until his retirement in 2004. During his farewell meeting with President Musharraf, General Kiani reportedly reminded him to commitment to doff his army uniform during a meeting, he said that the nation needed him. About commenting the Chenagai airstrike in Bajaur Agency, American forces was used in South and North Waziristan and 80 students were killed in a Bajaur Madrassa in an American operation. Chairman Federal Public Service Commission (2004–06) General Kiani retired from his military service on 14 October 2004, and was announced to be appointed as the Chairman of the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC), a government institution responsible for the appointment of the bureaucrats in the Federal Government of Pakistan. Kiani developed serious differences with Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz in 2006 over introducing of an ordinance. He had severe confrontation with Prime Minister Aziz and was of the view that the row between two men had become a personalized affair though he had pleaded President Musharraf not to drag the FPSC into a controversy. Kiani was succeeded by Shahid Aziz. According to Kiani, if this power was given to Cabinet ministers they would have gotten their own way. On 30 March 2006, Kiani resigned from the FPSC's chairmanship after the government reduced his tenure by two-and-a-half years through a presidential ordinance. On 13 May 2006, Kiani filed a petition of his dismissal in the Lahore High Court which was declined, therefore, Kiani filed a lawsuit against President Musharraf in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. A Supreme Court bench was constituted under Justice F.M. Khokhar and issued legal notices to President Musharraf, and Prime Minister Aziz's government to appear before the trial. However, before the trial took place, President Musharraf made an unsuccessful move suspend and dismissed Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, and declared state of emergency in 2007. Death Shortly after his interview with Shahid Masood on Geo News, Kiani was admitted to the CMH in Rawalpindi with the complaint of pain in abdomen where military doctors diagnosed an infection in his stomach and suggested operation. Despite his operation, his condition deteriorated and kept on ICU ward in a state of coma and passed away on 1 November 2008 at the age of 64. His funeral was attended a large number of people belonging to various walks of life besides including current Chief of Army Staff General Ashfaq Pervez Kiyani, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Tariq Majeed, Corps Commander Rawalpindi Lieutenant General Tahir Mehmood, former COAS General Mirza Aslam Baig, former DG ISI General (Retd) Hameed Gul, Regional Police Officer (RPO) Nasir Khan Durrani, members of Pakistan Ex‑Servicemen Association, ex‑Generals, political figures, former Azad Jammu and Kashmir President Sardar M. Anwar Khan, President and General Secretary of Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) Sardar Asmat Ullah Khan and Malik Siddique Awan and other lawyers. He is survived by his wife and three daughters. Later, after burial ceremony, Auditor General of Pakistan Army (AGP) Lieutenant General Javed Zia laid floral wreaths on the grave of Late General Kiyani on behalf of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Ashfaq Pervez Kiyani and Corps Commander Rawalpindi Lt General Tahir Mehmood. Dissent and criticism on Musharraf On June 4, 2008, Kiani appeared in the Meray Mutabiq, a political talk show, on Geo News and was interviewed by Dr. Shahid Masood where he severely criticised President Pervez Musharraf and his role in Kargil and War on Terror. He termed President Mushrraf's policies as \\"evil actions\\", quoting that he had committed grave mistakes by involving the country in Kargil, and his personal role in the War on Terror, which he was of viewed as surrendering to the U.S. threat of pushing Pakistan into the Stone Age and the armed action on the far-right Red Mosque. He was also critical of treatment given to the Afghan ambassador Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef in 2001, and recommended actions against it but his advice fell on deaf ears. Calls for Kargil War introspection In 2008, Kiani called for introspection on the Kargil War by constituting a Commission, and reportedly marked that Nawaz Sharif did not know anything about the Kargil episode nor he was fully briefed on the events. He supported holding of a probe into the Kargil fiasco, adding factors behind the scene, about which people do not know, would also come into the limelight. In an interview, Masood asked what was General Musharraf's plan, General Kiyani said he had briefed Nawaz Sharif and told him that it was a very sensitive issue and he could not unveil all the details to him. He was only apprised of the ongoing situation. Nawaz time and again asked about the truth from senior officials including Sartaj Aziz who was the foreign minister. He also tried to persuade the chief of army staff. General Majid spoke in detail on the issue. General Mahmood was the corps commander then. Kiyani said our Jawans (soldiers) bravely fought the Kargil War. I think they revived the memories of the 1965 war. Our officers fought more fiercely than in the 1965 War and repulsed enemy attacks time and again. Despite the fact that supplies were disrupted due to extreme cold, the Jawans continued the war. He repeated that arguments will come up when there will be a probe.Ibid He termed Nawaz's travel to the United States a bid to save the prestige of the Pakistan Army. He said in the meeting of 17 May Nawaz gave a green signal to the operation. He assured conditional support to General Musharraf that the government would back the operation when he successfully moved forward. If unfortunately the same failed, he would not be in a position to support General Musharraf's game plan. When the army was caught in an awkward situation, he again travelled to the United States to save the symbol of the country, the Pakistan Army. Criticism and legacy After his revelation, Kiani was widely criticised by the Major General (retired) Rashid Qureshi, the spokesperson of Pervez Musharraf. Rashid Qureshi termed the charges against Musharraf as \\"foolish and rubbish\\". Major-General Qureshi had also said that General Kiani had behaved like \\"an angry and perturbed child\\" who was talking senselessly about all the favours bestowed on him. Qureshi leveled charges on him on ethicality and maintained that: \\"He showed sham loyalty and got promotions and lucrative appointments after retirement. On showing poor performance former Prime minister Aziz sacked him. If he was an upright person, he should have rejected appointment after retirement. Indeed, he was trying to benefit some political elements. During service he did not utter a single word against the policies of Musharraf\\", the Qureshi concluded.\\" General Kiani is remembered in Pakistan's defence circles as A brave soldier of the Pakistan Army. Having remembered as upright, strict and an honest intelligence officer of the army, General Kiani played an active role in the ex-servicemen society's struggle for separation of the offices of the President and army chief. Kiani had faced the threats of court martial last year for raising voice on many matters that have been tabooed in Pakistan for many years. He asked for an inquiry into Kargil operations, which he called a debacle. He also demanded inquiry into the assault on Red Mosque (Lal Masjid) and the girls' seminary (Jamia Hafsa) of Islamabad and claimed that white phosphorus bombs were used in the assault. He also called for the trial of General Pervez Musharraf for repeatedly violating the constitution.Ibid See also *Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 *Pakistani prisoners of war in India *Kargil war *Movement to impeach Pervez Musharraf  References  External links  * Kiani Died * Gen Jamshed Gulzar Kiyani dies * Gen Jamshed Gulzar Kiyani (r) July 1928 – Nov 1, 2008 * General Kiani * Kiani Died * Kiyani Passes Away * The News International * Kiani Passed Away Category:1944 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Government Gordon College alumni Category:Pakistan Military Academy alumni Category:National Defence University, Pakistan alumni Category:People of East Pakistan Category:People of Inter-Services Intelligence Category:Baloch Regiment officers Category:Pakistani military personnel of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 Category:People of the Bangladesh Liberation War Category:Pakistani generals Category:Pakistani memoirists Category:Pakistani conscientious objectors Category:Recipients of Hilal-i-Imtiaz Category:Recipients of Sitara-e-Jurat Category:Recipients of Tamgha-e-Basalat Category:20th-century memoirists ","title":"Jamshed Gulzar Kiani"},{"id":"25777677","text":"Joseph or Joe Fox may refer to: * Joseph Fox the elder (1729–1785), British medical doctor * Joseph Fox the younger (1758–1838), British medical doctor * Joseph Fox (Pennsylvania politician), speaker of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly, 1764–66 * Joseph Fox (dental surgeon) (1775–1816), British pioneer of dental education * Joseph John Fox (1855–1915), Roman Catholic bishop * Joe Fox (boxer) (1894–1965), British boxer * Joe Fox (footballer) (1879–1948), Australian rules footballer * Joe Fox (politician) (1931–1981), Irish politician * Joseph Francis Fox (1853–1903), Member of Parliament for Tullamore ","title":"Joseph Fox"},{"id":"25777683","text":"The Kathmandu International Mountain Film Festival (KIMFF) has been held in Kathmandu since 2000. Starting out as a biennial festival, KIMFF turned annual and competitive in 2007. KIMFF typically takes places around 11 December to coincide with the International Mountain Day. Modes KIMFF uses cinemas, other visual art forms, workshops and discussion forums to inform and educate as wide and as large a variety of audience on particular issues within the duration of the festival. After the completion of festival in Kathmandu, a special package of films is taken to various locations within Nepal as a part of Travelling KIMFF. Extreme sports, adventure, religion, or distinct cultural practices, human beings relate with mountains in a myriad of ways. In a world whose character and landscapes are rapidly changing, our relationship with mountains is only getting broader, subtler, and more intricate. The growing diversity and complexity of this relationship is what Kathmandu International Mountain Film Festival (KIMFF) seeks to explore. KIMFF, the only festival of its kind east of Suez, brings to Kathmandu Valley some of the most recent and exciting films about mountains, mountain environment, mountain cultures and communities from various corners of the world. KIMFF screens films produced during the last three years and features discussion forums, on-demand screenings, as well as exhibitions of books and photography celebrating mountains. The festival is organized with the conviction that human experiences in the world’s highlands, especially those in the developing countries, is worth documenting and sharing. KIMFF hopes not only to encourage a deeper understanding of the social and cultural realities of those regions but also to create a sense that the significance of those regions is often far-flung. Organized by Himal Association, KIMFF started as a non-competitive, biennial festival in 2000. A wide selection of films – alpine documentation, archival footage, adventure cinema, experimental shorts, commentaries, anthropological narratives, feature films, etc. – have been screened in the previous four festivals. These movies have dealt with issues regarding cultural practices, lifestyles, conflict, wildlife, mountain-climbing, environment, globalization, and gender, among many others. Over the years, the festival has attracted not only filmmakers, film enthusiasts, and critics, but also scholars, journalists, activists, and mountaineers. It is the interest of this creative and intellectual community that has sustained KIMFF and placed Kathmandu Valley on the map of international film festivals. The impetus for the festival has always been the trust of this community in the capability of the audio-visual medium in creating social and economic transformations. International KIMFF is also one of the member of International Alliance for Mountain Film (IAMF) among others like Banff Mountain Film Festival, Trento Film Festival, Autrans and others.

He was president of the University of Michigan from 1968 to 1979—and interim president again in 1988—and established a reputation for patience and willingness to engage in dialogue with students during the frequent campus protests of that era. He has been called \\"one of the truly great presidents of the University of Michigan\\". He served as chancellor of the University of Wisconsin–Madison from 1964 to 1967 and also led that institution through a period of campus unrest—including, in one instance, writing a personal check to cover bail for students arrested during a demonstration. He also worked as a lawyer in the U.S. Army during World War II, as a labor negotiator, and as president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  Early life and education  Robben Wright Fleming was born in Paw Paw, Illinois, on December 18, 1916, to Edmund P. Fleming and Emily Jeannette Wheeler. He was of Scottish descent on his father's side, while his mother's Dutch ancestors had come to the U.S. in 1652. His brother Teddy contracted spinal meningitis in 1926, and died after a two-week illness. To remember his brother, Fleming began using Teddy's middle name—Wheeler—as his own middle name, and did so until the Army made him revert to his legal name; his own first name was a concatenation of his uncle Robert's and grandfather Beniah's names. His father ran a general store and an indoor recreational facility, but the businesses fell apart during the Great Depression and his father died in 1933 of tuberculosis, leaving the family with no income, so his mother took a job in a one-room school house outside of town. In high school, Fleming participated in forensics and drama and also played sports, principally basketball and baseball. He graduated as valedictorian and received a scholarship to Beloit College, where he enrolled in 1934. After graduating in 1938, he chose to go to the University of Wisconsin Law School in Madison. Fleming received his law degree and was admitted to both the Wisconsin and federal bars in June 1941. He had already secured a job offer from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), though he was aware he was likely to be called up in the draft in the near future due to the increasing likelihood of war.  Family  Fleming met Aldyth Louise \\"Sally\\" Quixley, a fellow student from Rockford, Illinois, in 1935, when they were both working in the dining hall at Beloit College, and they dated seriously his final two years of school. She worked a variety of jobs in Illinois while he was at law school and joined him in Washington, D.C., after he started his job with the SEC. He proposed to her in Lafayette Square over Christmas 1941, and they were married by Rev. Peter Marshall at New York Avenue Presbyterian Church on April 3, 1942. The Flemings had two daughters, Nancy Jo and Carolyn Elizabeth, and one son, James Edmund.  Government, military, and early academic career  Fleming began his work in the corporate reorganizations division of the SEC in June 1941. He found the work uninteresting and came to believe managers were hiring more attorneys than the workload required simply to avoid losing the positions. After President Franklin D. Roosevelt re-established the National War Labor Board, Fleming used his connections with two University of Wisconsin law faculty members who were involved with its formation to secure a junior position with the organization, beginning in April 1942. He served as a panel assistant whose initial duties involved assisting mediators trying to settle disputes between labor unions and employers, but due to personnel shortages he and other junior staff members were soon assigned to travel and attempt to mediate disputes themselves. His first such assignment was to mediate a dispute between the United Auto Workers and the Machinists Union, which were both trying to organize a Wright Aeronautical factory in Connecticut.  World War II  Fleming's draft number came up and in August 1942 he received his induction orders, which sent him to Fort Riley, Kansas, through December for basic training, and then to Fort Custer, Michigan, for three months of Officer Candidate School. He boarded a ship for Algiers on August 27, 1943, arriving there on September 17, and after a detour to Bizerte, Tunisia, he arrived for duty in Tizi Ouzou, Algeria, where he was posted until December, when he was sent to Naples, Italy. In March 1944, he was sent to Gourock, Scotland, then Shrivenham and Eastbourne in England, to await the invasion of Normandy. Following the liberation of Paris in August 1944, he was sent to France, then Belgium, where he remained until the end of the year. In January 1945 his team of civil affairs officers attached to the Ninth Army went to Stolberg, Germany, which had been a city of 30,000 people, of whom only about 10,000 remained. Fleming was responsible for legal services, public health, and supplying labor for restoring bridges and public utilities. He approached the latter problem by offering a free lunch for volunteer laborers. Many of the legal situations he dealt with involved the military's non-fraternization policy designed to keep Americans from interacting with German citizens. He was transferred to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force at Versailles in February, the work of a friend there who thought he would find the work at headquarters more interesting, but Fleming asked to be transferred back to his unit in Germany and returned there in March. Upon his return to Germany, Fleming served as defense counsel to a pair of sixteen-year-old boys in the Hitler Youth who had been caught spying behind American lines; he lost at trial, an appeal was rejected, and the boys were shot. After the war ended, his unit traveled south and he visited the recently liberated Dachau concentration camp; he later recounted the visit in his autobiography and wrote, \\"Nothing angers me more today than the bigoted scoundrels who would have a new generation ... believe that all of this never happened. Those of us who know ... because we were there have an obligation to speak out.\\" He was ordered home in November 1945 and discharged from the army as a captain on December 16.  Academic life  Fleming took a job with the newly created Veterans Emergency Housing Program, under the direction of Wilson Wyatt. He had hopes that working for the rising Democratic star would make for an exciting place to work, but the agency never got off the ground, and he began looking for other work. Around the same time, the University of Wisconsin offered him a position as assistant professor and director of a new Industrial Relations Center; he accepted the offer and worked there from 1947 to 1952. He returned to Washington from April to September 1950 to serve as executive director of a wage control board President Harry Truman had created at the onset of the Korean War, and during this time he also began to work as an arbitrator. Fleming later served as president of the National Academy of Arbitrators from 1966 to 1967, and was a charter member of the organization at its founding in 1947. Although he was recommended for promotion at Wisconsin, he felt unsure of the prospect for tenure while in his role at the center. When the University of Illinois offered a position as a full professor and director of the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations, he accepted, effective September 1952. In 1957 he became a professor of law and continued to have time off to perform arbitration work, and in 1963, the president of the University of Wisconsin system called to offer him a new position. The Wisconsin system was being reorganized with a provost at each campus under the overall direction of the president, Fred Harrington, and Harrington wanted Fleming for the position in Madison; Fleming accepted, effective September 1964.  Chancellor of University of Wisconsin–Madison (1964–1967)  At their January 10, 1964, meeting, the board of regents of the University of Wisconsin named Fleming a professor of law and provost of the Madison campus, effective that September 1. A few months into his tenure, the regents revived the century-old title of chancellor for Fleming. The University of Wisconsin system was expanding rapidly at this time, and part of Fleming's job was ensuring that the Madison campus, which generated most of the revenue, kept an appropriate share of money for its own needs. The first significant student protests against the Vietnam War took place during Fleming's tenure, and his handling of these is the most notable aspect of his administration. In May 1966, Students for a Democratic Society organized an anti-draft sit-in in a campus building. Rather than forcibly eject the protestors, Fleming allowed them to occupy the building for five days provided they remained peaceful, and he allowed their representatives to address a faculty meeting on the topic. His restraint was widely praised at the time, with the Milwaukee Journal saying the university had \\"shown the nation that a student protest can be a legitimate exercise in democracy, not a disruptive episode in bitterness\\". Protest leaders viewed the sit-in as a failure because the university continued to cooperate with the Selective Service Administration. On February 22, 1967, police arrested seventeen protestors who refused to leave an engineering building at the end of a sit-in protesting Dow Chemical's on- campus recruiting. Fleming personally paid $1,155 in bail () for eleven of them who did not have money to pay their own, an action which drew criticism for being too lenient. He later explained that he did not want the students to become martyrs by remaining in jail during a student rally planned for that evening, and he was confident that if they were present in person, he could make a more persuasive argument than they could. The plan worked, and the protest was muted; students began to call Fleming the \\"Silver Fox\\" because they felt he was outwitting them. He also expanded university projects in Nigeria, France, Germany and Japan.  President of the University of Michigan (1968–1979)  After President Harlan Hatcher announced his retirement from the University of Michigan, the board of regents formed a presidential selection committee assisted by three advisory committees representing students, faculty, and alumni. The student panel voiced concerns related to campus diversity, the university's role in the military draft, and classified research programs with military applications; they also demanded an increased voice in decision-making and respect from the new president. Roger Heyns, then serving as chancellor of the University of California–Berkeley, was the early front-runner for the position. Regents Robert Briggs and Albert Bentley traveled to California in January 1967 to meet with him, but came away unimpressed with his demeanor in the wake of Governor Ronald Reagan's just- announced firing of University of California president Clark Kerr. Fleming was one of four or five candidates on the regents' shortlist, and after a member of the University of Minnesota's presidential search committee leaked news that the school had already made an offer to Fleming to fill its own open position, Michigan quickly invited him to meet with the advisory committees before the end of March. Following a meeting at Detroit's Hotel Ponchartrain that was almost entirely occupied by discussion of how to handle student protests, Briggs offered Fleming the position while driving him to the airport. Fleming accepted, later saying the choice between Michigan and Minnesota was difficult, but was decided by Michigan's academic reputation, his and Sally's preference to live in a smaller city, and a desire not to move further north to even colder weather than Madison's.  Handling early campus protests  The regents created the position of president-designate for Fleming beginning in September 1967, in order to give him four months of planning and orientation before he assumed his full duties on January 1. A student protest that October which disrupted a meeting between engineering faculty and Rear Admiral Samuel Brown demonstrated to the community the differing approaches of the outgoing and incoming administrations. The dean of the College of Engineering asked the Hatcher administration to impose disciplinary measures, and vice president for student affairs Richard Cutler in turn asked the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts to expel one of protestors, Karen Daenzer; the school refused to do so, but the attempt turned her into a cause célèbre on campus. In his own response to the incident, Fleming emphasized its positive aspects, pointing out that all parties acted with restraint, there was no violence, and the police were not involved; at the same time, he called for increased student participation in decision- making. As at Wisconsin, protest leaders at Michigan realized that Fleming's softer approach would make it more difficult to generate opposition to his administration—one, Robert Meeropol, wrote, \\"Hatcher was a great president to work against, because he ... did things that got other people more sympathetic with you, as opposed to Fleming ... We all knew Fleming's coming was a bad thing.\\" Shortly after Fleming took over officially in January 1968, he removed Cutler as vice president for student affairs; Cutler's earlier writings had expressed support for free expression on campus, but his actions in office, including an attempt to ban sit-ins in 1966 and his cooperation in providing the names of \\"subversives\\" to the House Un-American Activities Committee, did not fit into Fleming's philosophy of a restrained and dignified atmosphere of debate. Fleming left the post vacant until 1970, effectively keeping responsibility for student affairs for himself. In his inaugural speech in March 1968, Fleming drew a distinction between the behavior of student protestors and the message they were attempting to convey: The following month, on the morning of the funeral of Martin Luther King Jr., over one hundred African-American students locked themselves in the administration building in a protest over campus diversity. Fleming was the only administrator they allowed to enter the building, and he negotiated a peaceful end to the occupation that afternoon after promising further discussions, which eventually led to the creation of a scholarship fund in King's name and the creation of the Center of Afroamerican and African Studies in 1970. Afterwards, Fleming said of the students' demands, \\"We're interested in what they're interested in; we're not really at odds,\\" and said he felt the timing was appropriate \\"in this period of terrible emotional stress following the insane assassination of Dr. King\\". He also defended their behavior, saying, \\"These kids have not been hostile. We've had this terrible, terrible tragedy. You can't expect the normal rules to apply.\\" A similar building occupation later that month at Columbia University was resolved through police intervention that left hundreds of students and faculty members injured. In dealing with campus protests, Fleming favored a strategy of not letting minor differences become major incidents that would in turn serve as recruitment material for demonstrators. When an anti-war group's plan to dig a \\"bomb crater\\" on the Diag, the main campus square, raised concerns over damage to plumbing and wiring, Fleming found them a safe site to dig it and explained, \\"Why not let them dig one? Everybody else is digging holes for new buildings ... It's not a big job to throw the dirt back in the hole ...\\" Fleming himself described the Vietnam War as a \\"colossal mistake\\" at a teach-in September 1969 and called for the unilateral withdrawal of U.S. forces. This led Vice President Spiro Agnew to call him \\"gutless\\", though Fleming wrote that Agnew was \\"immensely unpopular with both students and faculty and nothing could have helped me more than his remarks\\".  The threat of violence  Fleming viewed vandalism and destruction of property as behavior he could not tolerate, threatening to delist Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) as an approved student organization if it did not reimburse the university for damages caused at an SDS-sponsored sit-in in November 1968. Recognizing that escalating protests nationwide might lead to more serious incidents in the future, in May 1969 he sought assurances that the police would cooperate with his strategy to avoid violence in the event buildings needed to be cleared of protestors; he proposed that he would always enter the building himself, that any police accompanying him would always be unarmed, that arrests would only be made if he deemed necessary, and that the police would retreat in the face of resistance rather than respond with force. Ann Arbor's chief of police, Walter Krasny, broadly agreed with Fleming's flexible approach, later writing: A bomb placed under an Army staff car parked outside the campus ROTC offices in June 1969 caused damage but no injuries. Later that month, two nights of impromptu partying that blocked off South University Street near the president's house was met with teargas fired by sheriff's deputies. Sources differ on what happened next. In his autobiography, Fleming says students came to his house with teargas in their eyes, which he let them into the kitchen to wash out, after which he went out and persuaded the deputy chief of police to withdraw, saying the sheriff, Douglas Harvey, had been \\"itching for a confrontation\\" and reacted beyond what was necessary. Newspaper accounts say Fleming became angry with the police and Harvey was dismissive of his concerns, while the city police agreed to a fifteen-minute delay to allow the crowd to disperse, but when a deputy was hit by a thrown rock, the police charged the crowd and used tear gas and pepper spray to clear the street. Details that emerged afterwards confirmed Fleming's view that university students were not responsible for the violence. The press treated the affair as a conflict between the president and the sheriff, treating Fleming as a hero; the Detroit Free Press wrote in an editorial, \\"Mr. Fleming has had far more experience, with far greater success, in handling these affairs than has Harvey. ... Mr. Fleming kept his campus calm. Now his best-laid plans have been undermined by one dumb cop.\\"  Black Action Movement  In February 1970, a coalition of students called the Black Action Movement (BAM) presented Fleming with a list of demands that included a minimum of 10% Black students by the 1973–1974 school year, the hiring of full-time recruiters to promote Black enrollment, a Black student center, and a variety of modifications to the financial aid program. Fleming delivered the administration's response to BAM in March, hoping to open negotiations, but BAM leaders found some of the wording offensive, particularly a passage about admissions criteria that concluded, \\"We do not know how much further deviation we can make in the criteria and still accomplish anything. At some point it is clear that the student is far better off to enter a college where the competition is less severe and where the course options are less academically oriented.\\" Faculty member and BAM supporter Madison Foster wrote of Fleming's response, \\"I don’t know if Fleming drafted the letter, but he certainly signed it. ... We’ll catch him in his color, symbolically, and jam him to the wall. He will not talk to us like that.\\" Fleming and the administration resisted committing to a 10% enrollment target, citing uncertainty over how to fund the effort. The regents approved a compromise in March that called the 10% number a \\"goal\\"; BAM called the proposal \\"repugnant\\" and called for a campus strike. White supporters of BAM disrupted an honors convocation and attempted to block access to classrooms before BAM leaders told them to stop and take no further actions unless Black student leaders instructed. BAM protestors picketed outside buildings, addressed classes, and engaged in protest actions such as blocking intersections and stopping drivers entering parking garages to discuss the strike's demands. Minor property damage and shoving matches also occurred. Bomb threats were made, although BAM leadership had ruled out such actions. Fleming reiterated that 10% Black enrollment remained a \\"goal\\" but that there was no guarantee of funds being available to achieve it, and said getting any further concessions would be \\"nearly impossible\\". On March 25, the faculty senate adopted a resolution calling for individual schools and colleges to adopt budget cuts to secure the funds to achieve the 10% goal, which allowed Fleming to announce that the funds had been secured on March 27. Further negotiation between Fleming and BAM leader Ed Fabre resulted in an agreement; BAM leaders organized a celebration, and the board of regents issued a statement that praised both the Black students and Fleming while directing a barb at other protestors: Vice President Agnew accused Fleming of \\"surrender\\" to militants for agreeing to the 10% goal, and the Muskegon Chronicle said the university was discriminating in favor of Black students and using a quota system to admit unqualified students. Fleming categorically denied the existence of a quota, citing the fact that the university would, in fact, fall short of its 10% goal because it was only a goal and not a quota. He later said the admissions department told him the agreement was generating a higher quality of applicants rather than lower, and he felt such policies \\"enrich rather than erode the quality of education\\".  University administration  By 1971, the campus unrest had largely dissipated, and other matters came to occupy Fleming's administration. One was finances, as cuts in public financing meant tuition and student fees made up a larger portion of revenues, from 25% in 1966–1967 to 33% in 1976–1977, leading him to worry that lower-income students would be unable to attend. In spite of budget concerns, Fleming was able to make some changes to the undergraduate program, adding a Residential College and securing legislative approval for turning the University of Michigan campuses at Dearborn and Flint into four-year institutions with independent chancellors, rather than branches that only offered upper-division courses in conjunction with local junior colleges. He also oversaw changes to the financing of the athletic department, so that it would be fully responsible for financing its operations, without support from the university's general fund. His administration promoted two departments to full schools: the School of Information and Library Studies and the School of Art. He oversaw the introduction of affirmative action programs, a campus-wide restructuring of salaries and compensation to address gender inequalities, and the construction of several major campus buildings, including the Hatcher Graduate Library, the Bentley Historical Library, the Power Center for the Performing Arts, and a building for the schools of architecture and art. In the fall of 1977, Fleming was approached with job offers to lead the State University of New York and the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara, but declined. Charles J. Hitch, president of the University of California system, said Fleming was under consideration as his successor; a visit to California turned into a job interview, but a conversation with Governor Jerry Brown left him unconvinced of Brown's commitment to continuing California's existing system of higher education, and he informed the board he was not interested. Another offer, from the chairman of the board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, was more interesting to the Flemings, and he announced his resignation from Michigan effective in the new year of 1979. Allan F. Smith served as interim president until Harold T. Shapiro was selected as a permanent successor.  Later career  Fleming and his wife spent two years in Washington, D.C., before returning to Ann Arbor permanently.  Corporation for Public Broadcasting  Fleming began his tenure as president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) in January 1979, and in his memoirs he described the public broadcasting system in the United States as a \\"badly organized entity\\" and a \\"nonsystem\\" that nonetheless did some good work. He lamented that there was \\"none of the discipline that made the British Broadcasting Corporation the model for excellence\\", because the system consisted of independent stations who would never agree to consistent programming or time schedules. Early in his tenure, he convinced the board to give up direct control over which programming CPB funded, in favor of a professionally run program fund. His primary accomplishment was negotiating a $150 million grant from philanthropist Walter Annenberg for the purposes of educational programming. To rectify Annenberg's desire to participate in the programming with the requirements of tax laws and the reluctance of the CPB board to accept outside interference, he proposed the creation of an Annenberg Council, with members from CPB, NPR, PBS, the Annenbergs themselves, as well as two outside members. This became the Annenberg/CPB Project, with Fleming serving as its first director. The project was delayed following the election of Ronald Reagan who, despite being a close friend of Annenberg, wanted to eliminate the CPB; his own party in Congress turned out not to support such a move, so the project moved forward once its future was secure. Fleming's first project as director was to enlist former CBS News president Fred Friendly to produce a series of televised seminars on the Constitution. Historian Nat Hentoff called the Fred Friendly Seminars, which began with that 13-part series, The Constitution — That Delicate Balance, \\"the most valuable, quintessential American television I have ever seen\\". Midway through his tenure at CPB, Fleming was diagnosed with a malignant lymphoma. He underwent chemotherapy and decided to retire by the end of 1981, when he would be 65, and made plans to return to Ann Arbor. He served as interim director of Annenberg/CPB on a part-time basis after returning to Michigan, until a permanent director was found.  Return to Michigan  Fleming returned to the University of Michigan as a professor of law until December 1985, when the regents named him professor emeritus and president emeritus. Fleming had taught one course each semester during his return, but found he was not teaching with the same \\"enthusiasm and skill\\" as he once had. He served as the chairman of the board of the National Institute for Dispute Resolution for eight years following his departure from CPB. The institute, a joint venture of the Hewlett Foundation, Ford Foundation, and MacArthur Foundation, sought to promote the use of alternative means of dispute resolution rather than the courts. He also served as the chairman of the Educational Testing Service's advisory committee and spent eleven years on the board of the S.C. Johnson Foundation. From 1985 to 1990, he served as Michigan Governor James Blanchard's representative to a group trying, ultimately unsuccessfully, to reform the state's medical malpractice system. The University of Michigan board of regents asked Fleming to serve as interim president for eight months in 1988, following the resignation of Harold T. Shapiro to take up the presidency of Princeton University. During this time, the administration tried to set up a process for adjudicating alleged cases of discrimination at the university, but lost a case brought by the ACLU in federal court that argued the system violated the First Amendment. His interim tenure ended with the appointment of James J. Duderstadt as president. In his later years, he served as an expert witness in several cases involving higher education, and in 1991 he served on a commission charged with setting the future direction for higher education in North Carolina..  Legacy  Fleming died in Ann Arbor, on January 11, 2010. The Fleming Administration Building of the University of Michigan He has been praised, especially by his former colleagues, for his restraint and tolerance for campus protests and student activism, particularly at the University of Michigan. Former University of Michigan president Mary Sue Coleman said he \\"will be remembered in the same breath as Henry Tappan and James Angell as one of the truly great presidents of the University of Michigan\\". At the ACLU's 50th Anniversary Dinner in 1970, the organization awarded Fleming a citation for \\"complete commitment to the protection and enlargement of civil liberties on the university campus\\", and said in awarding it that, \\"Perhaps more effectively than any other American educator he had defended the duty of the university to serve as the arena for the clash of ideologies and to do so not timidly but proudly.\\" The assessment of his behavior and legacy from those who participated in the protests themselves is mixed. Some agree with the popular description of him as a thoughtful and courteous interlocutor, among them Bill Ayers of SDS, who wrote, \\"He always wanted to know what you thought ... he was a pretty reasonable guy and I think he believed in the power of reason and the importance of evidence\\", Chicago Seven defendant Rennie Davis, who wrote, \\"His spirit to see humanity in any side is a legacy that will inspire us always\\", and Jim Toy of the Ann Arbor Gay Liberation Front, who wrote, \\"If he got riled, he continued to be polite.\\" Other contemporaries from the protest era have a negative assessment, such as former SDS members Eric Chester, who \\"found him to be a rigid personality, unwilling and unable to engage in a genuine give and take\\", and Gary Rothberger, who called Fleming a \\"cold dude who didn’t care about anything else other than carrying out his assignment\\" and said of his passivity towards alleged police brutality during the South University riots, \\"He did nothing when he could have spoken out.\\"  Commemoration  The University of Michigan's central administration building, designed in 1964 by Michigan's architect laureate Alden Dow, is named the Robben W. & Aldyth Fleming Administration Building. The board of regents approved an infrastructure plan in 2016 that will result in the demolition of the Fleming Building, but university president Mark Schlissel said the school would find another way to continue commemorating Fleming, whom he called one of his personal heroes.

After using it for ground tests to rate Dragon's shape and mass in various tests, SpaceX launched it into low Earth orbit on the maiden flight of the Falcon 9 rocket, on June 4, 2010. SpaceX used the launch to evaluate the aerodynamic conditions on the spacecraft and performance of the carrier rocket in a real-world launch scenario, ahead of Dragon flights for NASA under the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program. The spacecraft orbited the Earth over 300 times before decaying from orbit and reentering the atmosphere on 27 June.  Delays  In September 2009, the launch was slated to occur no earlier than November 29, 2009, however the launch was subsequently postponed ten more times, to launch dates in February, March, April, May, and June 2010, for multiple reasons including finding an open launch date, approvals, and retesting. The launch date was eventually set for June 4, 2010.  Processing  On October 16, 2009, nine Merlin 1C engines of the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket intended to launch the Dragon C100 were test fired at SpaceX's rocket engine test facility in McGregor, Texas. On January 2, 2010, the second stage of the Falcon 9 vehicle was test fired for the full duration required for orbital insertion, 345 seconds. By late February, the launch vehicle had been assembled and raised to its vertical position on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40), having been rolled out to the launch pad on February 19. On March 13, 2010, the first stage engines successfully underwent a 3.5 second static test firing, having failed a previous attempt the day before.  Launch  The Dragon boilerplate launches aboard Falcon 9 Flight 1, June 4, 2010. SpaceX announced in September 2009 that the Dragon Spacecraft Qualification Unit would be the payload for the first Falcon 9 launch. At the time, launch was scheduled to occur no earlier than November 2009. The launch date had been delayed several times for various reasons, The spacecraft was launched and entered orbit on June 4, 2010. The first actual launch attempt targeted a four-hour launch window opening at 15:00 UTC (11 a.m. EDT) on 4 June 2010, with the possibility of a launch attempt the following day in the event that launch did not occur inside the 4 June window. The first attempt to launch the rocket, at 17:30 UTC, was aborted seconds prior to liftoff due to a reported out of range engine parameter, which later turned out to be a sensor error. The launch was rescheduled, with a successful liftoff taking place an hour and fifteen minutes later at 18:45 UTC (2:45 pm EDT). The vehicle reached orbit successfully, entering into a orbit. Launch video (1 min 52 s) The rocket experienced \\"a little bit of roll at liftoff\\" as Ken Bowersox from SpaceX put it. This roll had stopped prior to the craft reaching the top of the lightning towers. A separate issue involved a moderate, uncorrected roll at the end of the second stage firing. The first stage, that is designed to be reusable, disintegrated during reentry, before the parachutes could be deployed.  Orbit  Following the launch, SpaceX left the qualification unit in low Earth orbit, where its orbit was allowed to decay and it reentered the atmosphere around 00:50 GMT on June 27, 2010. The qualification unit remained attached to the second stage of the launcher; production units separate for orbital maneuvering. SpaceX lost contact with the Dragon C100 and the Falcon 9 second stage shortly after orbit was achieved, as the on-board batteries were only designed to last long enough to launch. They re-entered in the early morning hours (UTC) on June 27, 2010. Although exact location is uncertain, it is believed to have disintegrated over Syria and Iraq.  UFO sightings  At around 5:30 am local time on June 5, 2010, sightings of a mysterious \\"lollipop-type swirl\\" light or cloud heading from west to east were reported in the Australian states of New South Wales and Queensland, as well as the Australian Capital Territory. The sightings were likened to the Russian RSM-56 Bulava rocket launch that prompted similar video and images from the Arctic known as the 2009 Norwegian spiral anomaly; it was suggested that the visible object was the spent upper stage or the qualification unit launched aboard the Falcon 9 or both.

These mechanisms include sensory processes through which cues connoting the presence of parasitic infections are perceived (e.g., the smell of a foul odor, the sight of pox or pustules), as well as stimulus–response systems through which these sensory cues trigger a cascade of aversive affective, cognitive, and behavioral reactions (e.g., arousal of disgust, automatic activation of cognitions that connote the threat of disease, behavioral avoidance). The existence of a behavioral immune system has been documented across many animal species, including humans. It is theorized that the mechanisms that comprise the behavioral immune system evolved as a crude first line of defense against disease-causing pathogens. Implications for human behavior Within the psychological sciences, there is extensive research linking the behavioral immune system to a variety of prejudices—including prejudices against people who aren't actually diseased but are simply characterized by some sort of visual characteristics that deviate from those of a subjectively prototypical human being. The disease–avoidant processes that characterize the behavioral immune system have been shown to contribute to prejudices against obese individuals, elderly individuals, and people with physical disfigurements or disabilities. In addition, the behavioral immune system appears to contribute to xenophobia and ethnocentrism. One implication is that these prejudices tend to be exaggerated under conditions in which people feel especially vulnerable to the potential transmission of infectious diseases. Additional lines of research on the behavioral immune system have shown that people engage in more reticent and conservative forms of behavior under conditions in which they feel more vulnerable to disease transmission. For instance, when the potential threat of disease is made salient, people tend to be less extraverted or sociable. Evidence suggests that the behavioral immune system also incorporates mechanisms designed to search out and process (heuristic) signs of disease at the level of basic visual attention. Implications for human culture The behavioral immune system also has consequences at a cultural level of analysis. Under ecological circumstances in which diseases are more prevalent, people also tend to display more reticent and socially restricted forms of behavior, and human cultures are defined by more conservative norms and value systems. Implications for immunology Some research suggests that the behavioral immune system has implications for the functioning of the physiological immune system too. One study found that the mere visual perception of diseased-looking people stimulated white blood cells to respond more aggressively to infection (as indicated by the production of the proinflammatory cytokine Interleukin 6 in response to a bacterial stimulus). Research also indicates that immune-relevant interventions which target pathogen transmission can interrupt behavioral responses. For example, receiving a flu vaccination or washing one's hands can reduce the extent of negative interpersonal and intergroup attitudes elicited by disease cues and concerns.

Political career In the early 1990s, the five pro-western governing parties, Christian Democracy (Democrazia Cristiana), the Italian Socialist Party, the Italian Social-Democratic Party, the Italian Republican Party and the Italian Liberal Party, lost much of their electoral strength almost overnight due to a large number of judicial investigations concerning the financial corruption of many of their foremost members (see the Mani Pulite affair). This led to a general expectation that upcoming elections would be won by the Democratic Party of the Left, the heirs to the former Italian Communist Party, and their Alliance of Progressives coalition unless there was an alternative. On 26 January 1994, Berlusconi announced his decision to \\"enter the field\\", presenting his own political party, Forza Italia, on a platform focused on protecting Italy from the Communists. His political aim was to convince the voters of the Pentapartito, (i.e. the usual five governing parties) who were shocked and confused by Mani Pulite scandals, that Forza Italia offered both novelty and the continuation of the pro-western free market policies followed by Italy since the end of the 2nd World War. Shortly after he decided to enter the political arena, investigators into the Mani Pulite affair were said to be close to issuing warrants for the arrest of Berlusconi and senior executives of his business group. During his years of political career Berlusconi has maintained that the Mani Pulite investigations were led by communist prosecutors who wanted to establish a soviet-style government in Italy. 1994 electoral victory In order to win the March 1994 general election Berlusconi formed two separate electoral alliances: Pole of Freedoms (Polo delle Libertà) with the Lega Nord (Northern League) in northern Italian districts, and another, the Pole of Good Government (Polo del Buon Governo), with the post-fascist National Alliance (Alleanza Nazionale; heir to the Italian Social Movement) in central and southern regions. In a shrewd pragmatic move, he did not ally with the latter in the North because the League disliked them. As a result, Forza Italia was allied with two parties that were not allied with each other. Berlusconi launched a massive campaign of electoral advertisements on his three TV networks. He subsequently won the elections, with Forza Italia garnering 21% of the popular vote, the highest percentage of any single party. One of the most significant promises that he made in order to secure victory was that his government would create \\"one million more jobs\\". He was appointed Prime Minister in 1994, but his term in office was short because of the inherent contradictions in his coalition: the League, a regional party with a strong electoral base in northern Italy, was at that time fluctuating between federalist and separatist positions, and the National Alliance was a nationalist party that had yet to renounce neo- fascism at the time. Fall of the Berlusconi I cabinet In December 1994, following the communication of a new investigation from Milan magistrates that was leaked to the press, Umberto Bossi, leader of the Lega Nord, left the coalition claiming that the electoral pact had not been respected, forcing Berlusconi to resign from office and shifting the majority's weight to the centre-left side. Lega Nord also resented the fact that many of its MPs had switched to Forza Italia, allegedly lured by promises of more prestigious portfolios. In 1998 various articles attacking Berlusconi were published by Lega Nord's official newspaper (www.lapadania.it), with titles such as \\"La Fininvest è nata da Cosa Nostra\\" – \\"Fininvest (Berlusconi's principal company) was founded by the Mafia\\". Berlusconi remained prime minister for a little over a month until his replacement by a technocratic government headed by Lamberto Dini. Dini had been a key minister in the Berlusconi cabinet, and Berlusconi said the only way he would support a technocratic government would be if Dini headed it. In the end, however, Dini was only supported by most opposition parties but not by Forza Italia. In 1996, Berlusconi and his coalition lost the elections and was replaced by a centre-left government led by Romano Prodi. Electoral victory of 2001 In 2001 Berlusconi again ran as leader of the centre-right coalition House of Freedoms (), which included the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, the Lega Nord, the National Alliance and other parties. Berlusconi's success in the May 2001 general election led to him becoming Prime Minister once more, with the coalition receiving 45.4% of the vote for the Chamber of Deputies and 42.5% for the Senate. On the television interviews programme Porta a Porta, during the last days of the electoral campaign, Berlusconi created a powerful impression on the public by undertaking to sign a Contratto con gli Italiani (), an idea apparently conceived by his advisor Luigi Crespi and inspired by Newt Gingrich's Contract with America introduced six weeks before the 1994 US Congressional election, which was widely considered to be a creative masterstroke in his 2001 campaign bid for prime ministership. In this solemn agreement, Berlusconi claimed his commitment on improving several aspects of the Italian economy and life. Firstly, he undertook to simplify the complex tax system by introducing just two tax rates (33% for those earning over 100,000 euros, and 23% for anyone earning less than that figure: anyone earning less than 11,000 euros a year would not be taxed); secondly, he promised to halve the unemployment rate; thirdly, he undertook to finance and develop a massive new public works programme. Fourthly, he promised to raise the minimum monthly pension rate to 516 euros; and fifthly, he would suppress the crime wave by introducing police officers to patrol all local zones and areas in Italy's major cities. Berlusconi undertook to refrain from putting himself up for re-election in 2006 if he failed to honour at least four of these five promises. The Berlusconi II cabinet From left to right: Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush and Silvio Berlusconi. Opposition parties claim Berlusconi was not able to achieve the goals he promised in his Contratto con gli Italiani. Some of his partners in government, especially the National Alliance and the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats have admitted the Government fell short of the promises made in the agreement, attributing the failure to an unforeseeable downturn in global economic conditions. Berlusconi himself has consistently asserted that he achieved all the goals of the agreement, and said his Government provided un miracolo continuo (a continuous miracle) that made all 'earlier governments pale' (by comparison). He attributed the widespread failure to recognize these achievements to a campaign of mystification and vilification in the printed media, asserting that 85% of newspapers were opposed to him. Luca Ricolfi, an independent analyst, held that Berlusconi had managed to maintain only one promise out of five, the one concerning minimum pension levels. The other four promises were not, in Luca Ricolfi's view, honoured. In particular, the undertakings on the tax simplification and the reduction of crime. Subsequent elections  House of Freedoms did not do as well in the 2003 local elections as it did in the 2001 national elections. In common with many other European governing groups, in the 2004 elections of the European Parliament, gaining 43.37% support. Forza Italia's support was also reduced from 29.5% to 21.0% (in the 1999 European elections Forza Italia had 25.2%). As an outcome of these results the other coalition parties, whose electoral results were more satisfactory, asked Berlusconi and Forza Italia for greater influence in the government's political line. The Berlusconi III cabinet In the 2005 regional elections (3 April/4 April 2005), the centre-left gubernatorial candidates won in 12 out of 14 regions where control of local governments and governorships was at stake. Berlusconi's coalition kept only two of the regional bodies (Lombardy and Veneto) up for re-election. Three parties, Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, National Alliance and New Italian Socialist Party, threatened to withdraw from the Berlusconi government. The Italian Premier, after some hesitation, then presented to the President of the Republic a request for the dissolution of his government on 20 April 2005. On 23 April he formed a new government with the same allies, reshuffling ministers and amending the government programme. A key point required by the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (and to a lesser extent by National Alliance) for their continued support was that the strong focus on tax reduction central to the government's ambitions be changed. The 2006 elections Operating under a new electoral law written unilaterally by the governing parties over strong criticism from the parliamentary opposition the April 2006 general election was held. The results of this election handed Romano Prodi's centre-left coalition, known as The Union, (Berlusconi's opposition) a very thin majority: 49.8% against 49.7% for the centre-right coalition House of Freedoms in the Lower House and a two- senator lead in the Senate (158 senators for The Union and 156 for the House of Freedoms). The Court of Cassation has subsequently validated the voting procedures and determined that the election process was constitutional. According to the new electoral rules, The Union, (nicknamed \\"The Soviet Union\\" by Silvio Berlusconi) with a margin of only 25,224 votes (out of over 38 million voters), nevertheless won 348 seats (compared to 281 for the House of Freedoms) in the lower house as a result of a majority premium given to whichever coalition of parties was awarded more votes. Ironically, the same electoral law that Berlusconi's coalition had approved shortly before the election in order to win the election, caused his defeat and gave Prodi the chance to form a new cabinet. However Prodi's coalition consisted of a large number of smaller parties. If only one of the nine parties forming The Union withdrew its support to Prodi, his government would have collapsed. This situation was also the result of the new \\"diabolic\\" electoral system. Centrist parties such as the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats immediately conceded The Union's victory, while other parties, like Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the Northern League, refused to accept its validity, right up until 2 May 2006, when Berlusconi submitted his resignation to President Ciampi. The \\"running board revolution\\": 2008 electoral victory and formation of a new party Following the run-up to the 2006 general election there had been talk among some of the components of the House of Freedoms regarding a possible merger into a \\"united party of moderates and reformers\\". Forza Italia, the National Alliance party of Gianfranco Fini, and the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats of Pier Ferdinando Casini all seemed interested in the project. Soon after the election, however, Casini started to distance his party from its historical allies. On 2 December 2006, during a major demonstration of the centre-right in Rome against the government led by Romano Prodi, Silvio Berlusconi proposed the foundation of a \\"Freedom Party\\", stressing that the people and the voters of the different political movements adhering to the demonstration were all part of a \\"people of freedom\\".The People of Freedom On 18 November 2007, after claiming the collection of more than 7 million signatures (including Umberto Bossi's) demanding the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano to call a fresh election, Silvio Berlusconi announced from the running board of a car in a crowded Piazza San Babila in Milan that Forza Italia would have soon merged or transformed into The People of Freedom party. Berlusconi also stated that this new political movement could see the participation of other parties. Both supporters and critics of the new party called Berlusconi's announcement \\"the running board revolution\\".Italian: \\"la rivoluzione del predellino\\" After the sudden fall of the Prodi II Cabinet on 24 January, the break-up of The Union coalition and the subsequent political crisis (which paved the way for a fresh general election in April 2008), Berlusconi, Gianfranco Fini and other party leaders finally agreed on 8 February 2008 to form a joint list named \\"The People of Freedom\\" (), allied with the Northern League of Umberto Bossi and with the Sicilian Movement for Autonomy of Raffaele Lombardo. In the snap parliamentary elections held on 13/14 April 2008 this coalition won against Walter Veltroni's centre-left coalition in both houses of the Italian Parliament. In the 315-member Senate of the Republic, Berlusconi's coalition won 174 seats to Veltroni's 134. In the lower house, Berlusconi's conservative bloc led by a margin of 9% of the vote: 46.5% (344 seats) to 37.5% (246 seats). Berlusconi capitalised on discontent over the nation's stagnating economy and the unpopularity of Prodi's government. His declared top priorities were to remove piles of trash from the streets of Naples and to improve the state of the Italian economy, which had underperformed the rest of the Eurozone for years. He also said he was open to working with the opposition, and pledged to fight tax evasion, reform justice and reduce public debt. He intended to reduce the number of Cabinet ministers to 12. Berlusconi and his ministers (Berlusconi IV Cabinet) were sworn in on 8 May 2008. On 21 November 2008 the National Council of Forza Italia, chaired by Alfredo Biondi and attended by Berlusconi himself, dissolved Forza Italia and established The People of Freedom, whose inauguration took place on 27 March 2009, the 15th anniversary of Berlusconi's first electoral victory. While Forza Italia had never held a formal party congress to formulate its rules, procedures, and democratic balloting for candidates and issues, (since 1994 three party conventions of Forza Italia have been held, all of them resolving to support Berlusconi and reelecting him by acclamation) on 27 March 2009 at the foundation congress of the People of Freedom political movement the statute of the new party was subject to a vote of approval. On 5820 voting delegates 5811 voted in favour, 4 against and 5 abstained. During that political congress Silvio Berlusconi was elected as Chairman of the People of Freedom by handraising. According to the official minutes of the congress the result favoured Berlusconi, with 100 percent of the delegates voting for him. The People of Freedom split and the fall of the Berlusconi IV cabinet Between 2009 and 2010 Gianfranco Fini, former leader of the conservative National Alliance (AN) and President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, became a vocal critic of the leadership of Berlusconi. Fini departed from party's majority line on several issues but, most of all, he was a proponent of a more structured party organisation. His criticism was aimed at the leadership style of Berlusconi, who tends to rely on his personal charisma to lead the party from the centre and supports a lighter form of party, which in his mind should be a movement-party that organises itself only at election times. On 15 April 2010 an association named Generation Italy was launched in order to better represent Fini's views within the party and push for a different party organisation. On 22 April 2010 the National Committee of the PdL convened in Rome for the first time in a year. The conflict between Fini and Berlusconi was covered live by television. At the end of the day a resolution proposed by Berlusconi's loyalists was put before the assembly and approved by a landslide margin. On 29 July 2010 the party executive released a document in which Fini was described as \\"incompatible\\" with the political line of the PdL and unable to perform his job of President of the Chamber of Deputies in a neutral way. Berlusconi asked Fini to step down and the executive proposed the suspension from party membership of three MPs who had harshly criticized Berlusconi and accused some party members of criminal offences. As response, Fini and his followers formed their own groups in both chambers under the name of Future and Freedom (FLI). It was soon clear that FLI would leave the PdL and become an independent party. On 7 November, during a convention in Bastia Umbra, Fini asked Berlusconi to step down from his post of Prime Minister and proposed a new government including the Union of the Centre (UdC). A few days later, the four FLI members of the government resigned. On 14 December FLI voted against Berlusconi in a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, a vote won by Berlusconi by 314 to 311. In May 2011 the party suffered a big blow in local elections. Particularly painful was the loss of Milan, Berlusconi's hometown and party stronghold. In response to this and to crescent fibrillation within party ranks, Angelino Alfano, the Justice minister, was chosen as national secretary in charge of re-organising and renewing the party. The appointment of 40-year-old Alfano, a former Christian Democrat and later leader of Forza Italia in Sicily, was unanimously decided by the party executive. On 1 July the National Council modified the party's constitution and Alfano was elected secretary almost unanimously. In his acceptance speech, Alfano proposed the introduction of primaries. Resignation On 10 October the Chamber of Deputies rejected the law on the budget of the State proposed by the government. As a result of this event Berlusconi moved for a confidence vote in the Chamber on 14 October, he won the vote with just 316 votes to 310, minimum required to retain a majority. An increasing number of Deputies continued to cross the floor and join the opposition and on 8 November the Chamber approved the law on the budget of the State previously rejected but with only 308 votes, while opposition parties didn't participate in the vote to highlight that Berlusconi lost his majority. After the vote, Berlusconi announced his resignation after Parliament passed economic reforms. Among other things, his perceived failure to tackle Italy's debt crisis with an estimated debt sum of €1.9 trillion ($2.6 trillion) is thought to have factored into Berlusconi's decision to leave office. While he resigned crowds of his opponents sang the hallelujah portion of George Frederick Handel's \\"Messiah\\", demonstrating their approval of the decision; there was also dancing in the streets outside the Quirinal Palace, the official residence of the President of Italy, where Berlusconi went to tender his resignation. The austerity package was passed, it will raise €59.8 billion in savings from spending cuts and tax raises, including freezing public-sector salaries until 2014 and gradually increasing the retirement age for women in the private sector from 60 in 2014 to 65 in 2026. The resignation also came at a difficult time for Berlusconi, as he was involved in numerous trials for corruption, fraud and sex offences. He was often found guilty in lower courts but is alleged to have used loopholes in Italy's legal system to evade incarceration. Berlusconi had also failed to meet some of his pre-election promises and had failed to prevent economic decline and introduce serious reforms. Many believed that the problems and doubts over Berlusconi's leadership and his coalition were one of the factors that contributed to market anxieties over an imminent Italian financial disaster, which could have a potentially catastrophic effect on the 17-nation eurozone and the world economy. Many critics of Berlusconi accused him of using his power primarily to protect his own business ventures. Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League, a partner in Berlusconi's right-wing coalition, was quoted as informing reporters outside parliament, \\"We asked the prime minister to step aside.\\"Hooper, John; Squires, Nick (10 November 2011). \\"The party's over\\". The Age, accessed 25 November 2011. =Announcement= Palazzo Grazioli CNN reported on 7 November that Berlusconi had previously denied the rumors that he was going to resign and had stated on his Facebook page that \\"The rumors of my resignation are groundless.\\" On 12 November 2011, after a final meeting with his cabinet, Berlusconi met Italian president Giorgio Napolitano at the Quirinal Palace to tender his resignation. He announced this to the Italian public by telephone on one of his television channels. Italian news agency ANSA reported that Berlusconi had remarked to his aides that \\"This is something that deeply saddens me\\". Berlusconi conceded that he had lost his parliamentary majority and concluded that \\"things like who leads or who doesn't lead the government was less important than doing what is right for the country.\\" Berlusconi issued a statement that he would not stand for office in Italy again after the budget defeat. In his resignation he was said to have also mentioned \\"eight traitors\\", former allies who had abstained. =Response= The Quirinal Palace. As he arrived at the Quirinal Palace, a hostile crowd gathered with banners shouting insults at Berlusconi and throwing coins at the car and some 200 people marched down Via del Corso yelling \\"resign, resign!\\". After his resignation, the booing and jeering continued as he left in his convoy, with the public shouting words such as \\"buffoon\\" and \\"mafioso\\". An orchestra performed the hallelujah portion of Händel's \\"Messiah\\" and the Dies Irae portion of Mozart's \\"Requiem\\" outside the Quirinal Palace, with vocal accompaniment and dancing in the streets. La Repubblicas headline on 13 November was \\"Berlusconi leaves, party in the streets\\" whilst La Stampas headline read \\"Berlusconi bids farewell, now for Monti\\". President Giorgio Napolitano issued a statement saying that Berlusconi had \\"demonstrated to the head of state his understanding of the implications of the vote in the chamber of deputies.\\" Opposition leader Pierluigi Bersani of the Democratic Party (PD) said \\"[He] has not disappeared. He has resigned\\". Antonio Di Pietro, leader of the Italy of Values, claimed Berlusconi was \\"taking another month to try to buy a few [parliamentarians]\\". On 12 November, following Berlusconi's resignation, Napolitano invited Mario Monti to form a new government. Monti accepted the offer and initiated talks with leaders of Italy's political parties, stating that he wished to form a government that would remain in office until the next scheduled elections in 2013. On 16 November, Monti announced that he had formed a Cabinet and was sworn in as Prime Minister of Italy. He also appointed himself as Minister of Economy and Finance.

Plot Bor, once the largest copper mine,Official website of RTB Copper Mining and Smelting Complex Bor but now just the biggest hole in Europe. Small union protest over the mine privatization is taking place. The plot revolves around Toda and Stefan, two best friends, skaters, who spend their first summer after finishing high school. Stefan's going to Belgrade to the university in fall. Toda says he wouldn't apply to the university even if he had the money. They spend time shooting \\"Jackass-like\\" videos they call Crap and hanging out with their friends and Dunja, their friend who came back from France for her holidays. Toda and Stefan get into a quiet battle for her attention and in that strange relationship of dying friendship and rivalry they try to get ahead of each other. Toda gets injured during one of the stunts and goes to a hospital where he learns that he has to apply to the employment bureau in order to get health insurance since he’s not a student any more. There he gets a counselor and has to attend meetings on which he will learn new methods of job application. That’s how Toda is forced into the bureaucratic world of adults. Spending more time at the counselor’s than with his friends makes him annoyed and his quarrels with Stefan slowly become more violent. But when the small union protest evolves into a huge riot their destructiveness will tie them together once again. Crap - Pain is Empty Crap - Pain is Empty is a one-hour home- made documentary shot during 2005 and 2006 by Stefan Đorđević, Marko \\"Toda\\" Todorović and their skate group. It is influenced by TV-shows like Jackass and Dirty Sanchez. They were still in high school while recording it. Stefan and Toda did almost all stunts with a small contribution of their friends. Stefan edited the film and since then they distributed it for free via DVDs and Rapidshare and promoted it on YouTube. Tilva Roš script Nikola Ležaić, writer and director of Tilva Roš, who is also born in Bor got a copy of Crap from his friend, and fell in love with it. He contacted Stefan and Toda and they started hanging out. In that process he decided to make a film based on the video clips Stefan and Toda made, combining them with other real events that happened to them, to him when he was a teenager, and to the town itself, like the union protest that really happened in 2004, and in that way creating a loose fictional plot heavily based on real events. Some stunts recorded for Crap ended up in Tilva Roš. The script was recognized and awarded by two Serbian film funds in 2008. The production started in July 2009 and it was finished in four weeks. Casting The idea of kids playing themselves was there from the beginning. The characters are not exact presentations of real Stefan and Toda, the characters have different family backgrounds but they are heavily based on real people. The character of Dunja played by Dunja Kovačević, the art student from Novi Sad, is the only fictional member of the group. She was introduced to the group a week before the start of the production. The only roles played by the real actors are Toda's and Stefan's parents and the karaoke show presenter. Skate team \\"Kolos\\" Skate Team Kolos group photo 2009. Skate team \\"Kolos\\" is a skate group created in June 2005. by Stefan Đorđević, Marko Todorović and Marko Milenković as its only members. In next couple of years they spread their interest in skateboarding to younger kids and the team grew rapidly. In 2005. there were only few skaters in Bor but up until 2010. the number grew to around 30. Almost all of them appear in Tilva Roš, and the team is often referenced in the film. Most of them were underage during the production. Together with Skate Team \\"Zglob\\" from Negotin and Shorty, graffiti artist from Zaječar, they form KZS (Kolos Zglob Shorty), a kind of eastern Serbian skate alliance numbering more than 50 skaters. In late 2009. skate team Kolos registered NGO in order to gather funds needed for creating a skate park in Bor. Language and dialect The language used in the film is Serbian, spoken in a dialect still widely used in daily parlance in Eastern Serbia. Since a group of people talks simultaneously in almost every scene of the movie, the usage of the dialect relatively uncommon in other areas increases the incomprehensibility of the dialogues, but also makes the scenes appear more realistic. Style The film combines \\"YouTube aesthetics\\" of the hand-held video clips and long, slow-paced, usually wide shots with complicated mise en scène. Title Tilva Roš in the 1940s or 50s The title Tilva Roš is the name of the area around Bor where the first geological explorations of copper ore were done in the late 19th century. In Vlachian it means The Red Hill. The hill looked red because it was full of copper ore. This is mentioned in the first scene of the film. Soundtrack The soundtrack of Tilva Roš is compiled by several US bands and musicians, and almost all of them donated their music for free. Most of them, like ieatpants, Bobalouie and Siena, Baggy Time and Conjugal Visit are self- published musicians or under some of the Creative Commons licenses. The only artists with publishers are Privacy released by Marriage Records, and Panda Bear released by Paw Tracks. The soundtrack is not officially published yet.

Berlusconism Berlusconism () is a term used in the Western media and by some Italian analysts to describe the political positions of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Origins and features The term \\"Berlusconismo\\" emerged in the 1980s, characterised by a strongly positive connotation, as synonym of the \\"entrepreneurial optimism\\" of the time, defined as an entrepreneurial spirit which is not discouraged by difficulties, with a confidence in being able to solve problems.Floriano De Angeli, \\"L'Europeo\\", n. 49, 1993 However, starting in the 21st century, in consequence of the increasing identification of Silvio Berlusconi as a primarily political figure, the attributed meaning changed in the context of journalistic and political language. According to the Italian definition given by the online vocabulary of the Encyclopedia Institute, Berlusconismo has a wide range of meanings, all having their origins in the figure of Silvio Berlusconi, and the political movement inspired by him: the substantive refers not only to the \\"thought movement\\", but also to the \\"social phenomenon\\", and, even, the phenomenon \\"of custom\\" bound to his entrepreneurial and political figure. The term Berlusconismo is also used to refer to a certain laissez- faire vision supported by him, not only of the economy and the markets, but also with reference to the same policy.«berlusconismo» s. m., lemma del Vocabolario Treccani online, dal sito dell'Istituto dell'Enciclopedia italiana Treccani According to his political opponents and business rivals, Berlusconismo is only a form of demagogic populism, comparable to fascism, stressing the fact that Berlusconi has declared his admiration for Benito Mussolini, even though he has criticised the racial Fascist laws and the alliance with Nazi Germany, referring to himself as pro-Israel. In 2013, he returned to calling Mussolini a good leader whose biggest mistake was signing up to exterminate the Jews. Instead his supporters compare Berlusconismo to the French Gaullism and the Argentine Peronism. Political positions Silvio Berlusconi during a Forza Italia rally. Berlusconi defines himself, and by extension Berlusconism, as moderate,Berlusconi: \\"Dialogo? Io sono il più moderato di tutti!\\", Affaritaliani, 11 febbraio 2009 liberal and pro-free trade (Liberismo). However, national and foreign authors have noticed that Berlusconi's liberal rhetoric was little applied during his governments, never reducing taxes or public spending, or also growing its. A feature of Berlusconi's leadership tactics is to use the party as a mean to gain power (with the party described as a \\"light party\\", because of its lack of a complex internal structure). This is decidedly comparable to the political tactics used by Charles De Gaulle in France. Another feature of great importance is the emphasis on a \\"Liberal revolution\\", publicised and summarised by the \\"Contract with the Italians\\" of 2001. A strong reformism is added to these pillars, principally of the form of the Italian state and the constitution\\" in favour of moving from a Parliamentary system to a Semi-presidential system, a higher election threshold, the abolition of the Senate, the halving in size of the Chamber of Deputies, the abolition of the provinces and the reform of the judiciary, with separation of the careers between magistrates and magistrates's civil responsibility, from Berlusconi considered impartial. Berlusconi has declared himself to be persecuted by the judiciary, having undergone 34 processes, accusing them of being manipulated by the political left and comparing himself to Enzo Tortora as a victim of a miscarriage of justice. More recently, Berlusconi has declared himself in favour of Civil Unions. Attempt to reform the Italian constitution A key point in Berlusconi's government programme was a planned reform of the Italian Constitution, which Berlusconi considered to be 'inspired by [the] Soviets', an issue the coalition parties themselves initially had significantly different opinions about. The Lega Nord insisted on a federalist reform (devolution of more power to the Regions) as the condition itself for remaining in the coalition. The National Alliance party pushed for the so- called 'strong premiership' (more powers to the executive), intended as a counterweight to any federalist reform, in order to preserve the integrity of the nation. The Union of Christian and Centre Democrats asked for a proportional electoral law that would not damage small parties and was generally more willing to discuss compromises with the moderate wing of the opposition. Difficulties in arranging a mediation caused some internal unrest in the Berlusconi government in 2003, but then they were mostly overcome and the law (comprising power devolution to the regions, Federal Senate and \\"strong premiership\\") was passed by the Senate in April 2004; it was slightly modified by the Chamber of Deputies in October 2004, and again in October 2005 and finally approved by the Senate on 16 November 2005 with a bare majority. Approval in a referendum is necessary in order to amend the Italian Constitution without a qualified two-thirds parliamentary majority. The referendum was held on the 25th and 26 July 2006 and resulted in the rejection of the constitutional reform, with 61.3% of the voters opposing it. Foreign policy Brazilian ex-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva with Silvio Berlusconi From left to right: Silvio Berlusconi, Dmitry Medvedev, Angela Merkel, and Gordon Brown From left to right: Vladimir Putin, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and Silvio Berlusconi, at the opening of a gas pipeline US President Barack Obama meets Silvio Berlusconi in the Oval Office of the White House Berlusconi and his cabinets have had a strong tendency to support American foreign policies, despite the policy divide between the U.S. and many founding members of the European Union (Germany, France, Belgium) during the Bush administration. Under his lead the Italian Government also shifted its traditional position on foreign policy from being the most pro-Arab western government towards a greater friendship with Israel and Turkey (Silvio Berlusconi acted as wedding witness for the son of the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan) than in the past, hence rebalancing relations with all the Mediterranean countries to reach equal closeness with them. Berlusconi is one of the strongest supporters of Turkey's application to accede to the European Union. In order to support Turkey's application the Italian Premier invited Prime Minister Erdoğan to take part in a meeting of the European leaders of Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, gathered in L'Aquila for the 2009 G8 summit. Italy, with Berlusconi in office, became a solid ally of the United States due to his support in deploying Italian troops in the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War following the 2003 invasion of Iraq in the War on Terror. Berlusconi, in his meetings with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and U.S. President George W. Bush, said that he pushed for \\"a clear turnaround in the Iraqi situation\\" and for a quick handover of sovereignty to the government chosen by the Iraqi people. By the end of Berlusconi's administration, Italy had some 2,700 troops deployed in Southern Iraq. Italian troops were gradually withdrawn from Iraq in the second half of 2006 with the last soldiers leaving the country in December of the same year in the Romano Prodi government administration. Relations with Russia The cabinets chaired by Silvio Berlusconi have enhanced and strengthened the ties between Italy and Russia, which were already substantial in the Soviet Union period because during the Cold War Italy had the strongest communist party in western Europe. Vladimir Putin has many times expressed his appreciation for the respect shown by the Italian Prime Minister towards the leadership of the Russian Federation. Silvio Berlusconi is among the most vocal supporters of closer ties between Russia and the European Union. In an article published to Italian media on 26 May 2002, he said that the next step in Russia's growing integration with the West should be EU membership. On 17 November 2005 he commented in regards to the prospect of such a membership that he is \\"convinced that even if it is a dream ... it is not too distant a dream and I think it will happen one day.\\" The Prime Minister of Italy has made similar comments on other occasions as well. Cooperation with Libya On 30 August 2008, the Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi and Berlusconi signed a historic cooperation treaty in Benghazi. Under its terms, Italy will pay $5 billion to Libya as compensation for its former military occupation. In exchange, Libya will take measures to combat illegal immigration coming from its shores and boost investments in Italian companies. The treaty was ratified by Italy on 6 February 2009, and by Libya on 2 March, during a visit to Tripoli by Berlusconi. In June Gaddafi made his first visit to Rome, where he met Prime Minister Berlusconi, Italian President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano and Senate's Speaker Renato Schifani. Gaddafi also took part in the G8 summit in L'Aquila in July as Chairman of the African Union. During the summit a warm handshake between US President Barack Obama and Muammar Gaddafi took place (the first time the Libyan leader has been greeted by a serving US president), then at summit's official dinner offered by President Giorgio Napolitano US and Libyan leaders upset the ceremony and sat by the Italian Prime Minister and G8 host, Silvio Berlusconi. (According to ceremony's orders Gaddafi should seat three places after Berlusconi) However, when Gaddafi faced a civil war in 2011, Italy imposed a freeze on some Libyan assets linked to him and his family, pursuant to a United Nations-sponsored regime and then bombed the country with the violation of Libya of the No-Fly Zone. After the death of Gaddafi, Italy recognized the National Transitional Council as the government of Libya. Cooperation with the Western Balkans On 5 April 2009 at the EU-USA summit in Prague Silvio Berlusconi proposed an 8-point road map to accelerate the Euro-Atlantic integration of the western Balkans. During that summit the Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini urged his European colleagues to send \\"visible and concrete\\" signs to the countries concerned (Serbia, Kosovo, Bosnia, Montenegro, Croatia, Macedonia, and Albania). The first point concerns the liberalisation of visas between the EU and the Western Balkans. The Italian Government hopes that liberalisation can begin between late 2009 and early 2010, with priority being given to Serbia and Macedonia. The second point calls upon the European Commission to prepare a technical report on Montenegro’s accession to EU, which will be followed by those of Serbia and Albania, while the third point urges completion of Croatia’s EU accession process by the end of 2010. The fourth point regards strengthening the role of the EU High Representative for Bosnia Herzegovina Valentin Inzko. The fifth calls for the entrance into effect of the Association and Stabilisation Agreement with Serbia, which, in turn, is to collaborate fully with the Hague Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The sixth point calls for the rapid resolution of the dispute putting Skopje against Athens over the name “Macedonia”. The seventh point concerns Italy’s insistence on the importance of economic support for the young Republic of Kosovo. The Eighth point requests for an EU-Balkans summit, enlarged to the United States, to be held by mid-2010. Legislative actions From 2001 to 2006, Berlusconi's parliamentary majority passed many pieces of legislation, including: * The law on large public works: the \\"Highways on the sea\\" project, high speed railways connecting Turin-Milan-Florence-Rome-Naples and Turin-Verona-Venice; the MOSE project to save the city of Venice; the Messina Bridge between Sicily and mainland Italy; the underground in Rome, Parma, Naples, Turin, Milan; modernisation of highways and water structures in southern Italy. * The reform of the labour system, with the so-called \\"legge 30\\" or \\"legge Biagi\\" (named after the Italian professor of labour law killed by the communist terrorist group Red Brigades due to his role as economic advisor to the Berlusconi administration) promoting labour flexibility for new workers * The new pensions law, issued in July 2004, raising the minimum age for retirement and adding incentives for delayed retirement. The so-called \\"Maroni Reform\\", named after the former Minister of Welfare, would have gradually raised the retirement age. Before the reform came into force in 2008, it was stopped by the newly elected centre-left government. Instead of 60 years, the minimum age was reduced again to 58 years. * The reform of the school system, called \\"riforma Moratti\\", named after the former Minister of Education, Universities and Research. It was quickly put under revision by the centre-left government when Romano Prodi returned to power. * The reform of rules regarding drivers' licenses, which led to a significant decrease in car accidents, in particular lethal ones, according to the Italian police department. * The harsh \\"Article 41-bis prison regime\\" for Mafia leaders. It was made a permanent provision. Under previous law, it had to be renewed every two years. * Abolition of donation and inheritance taxes. It was reinstated by the subsequent government of Romano Prodi. * The banning of smoking in offices, bars, restaurants and all closed public places, which went into effect in January 2005. * The Urbani decree, named after the Ministro per i beni e le attività culturali Giuliano Urbani, punishing anyone who circulated, even via file sharing software, a film or other copyrighted material or part of it, or enjoyed it with the same technology, with a 1,500 € fine, the confiscation of the instruments and material, and the publication of the measure on a national daily paper and a periodical about shows. The decree was later modified by the parliament to include only copyright violation for the purpose of profit, where \\"profit\\" includes the savings due to not buying the software. The Court of Cassation, however, ruled that \\"profit\\" only means an actual \\"significant monetary profit\\". * A tax increase on blank data storage devices (considered as a means for digital piracy) to finance the intellectual property agency Siae. This was required by a European Union directive, but the fee in Italy is much higher than in most other EU countries, up to a 60% increase in price. ASMI, the association of digital supports producers, filed a complaint against Siae, reporting a 40% decrease in sales. * A law regulating artificial insemination, banning research on embryonic stem cells, pre-implant diagnosis and insemination by donors other than the husband, forcing women to be implanted after the embryo creation even in case of genetic diseases, recognising the embryo as entitled to human rights. The abrogation of the most controversial items has been the object of an unsuccessful popular referendum called in June 2005 by former allies such as the Italian Radicals, together with some (but not all) parties of L'Unione. * The reform of electoral law. The First Past the Post system, which had been approved by popular vote in a 1993 referendum, was replaced by a proportional representation system, with a majority prizeThe Constitutional Court noted \\"the problematic aspects of legislation that does not make the award of the majority prize on reaching a minimum threshold of votes and/or seats» (judgement n. 15/2008): for the winning coalition. (See also the section \\"Electoral System\\" in Parliament of Italy). Other laws were particularly controversial, the opposition considering them to be for the benefit of Berlusconi and his partners: * The Gasparri Law, new media reform legislation replacing the Mammì Law. Among other things, such legislation increased the maximum limit on an individual's share of the media market, allowing Berlusconi to retain control of his three national TV channels (one of which was still using a frequency which by law should have gone to another channel). The legislation also enabled the roll-out of digital television and internet based publishing, and hence his government claimed it resolved the problem of conflict of interest and his media monopoly \\"by opening up more channels\\". The law was initially vetoed by the President of the Republic, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, on charges of being unconstitutional. After being slightly modified, the law was adopted on 3 May 2004. * A much shorter statute of limitation for most crimes, coupled with an increase in sanctions for repeat offenders. The opposition argued that this law was designed to save a close friend of Berlusconi, Cesare Previti, from corruption charges; however, after modifications in parliament, Previti was excluded from the benefits of this law. However, the Italian Constitutional Court had to abolish this exclusion on the grounds of equality of all citizens before the law, so Previti did benefit from this law. * The suspension of criminal trials against the five highest officers of the state during their terms: the so-called \\"Lodo Maccanico\\", or \\"Lodo Schifani\\". It was declared unconstitutional in 2004 by the Constitutional Court. In July 2008, a similar bill, named the \\"Lodo Alfano\\", was approved by the parliament. Under the act, immunity was guaranteed for the four highest public servants. (the President of the Republic, the Speakers of the Houses of Parliament, and the Prime Minister). In October 2009, the Lodo Alfano was also declared unconstitutional.Italian Court Rejects Prime Minister’s Immunity, The New York Times, 7 October 2009 * The decriminalization of false account statements and their punishment with administrative fines, only if there is a specific damaged party reporting the fact to the authorities and if the alteration is less than 5% of profits or 1% of total assets; otherwise it is still a crime, punishable by up to six years of prison. In the last few weeks before the April 2006 general election, Berlusconi's parliamentary majority approved many disputed bills. For example, a bill for the Winter Olympics also included controversial provisions tightening penalties for drug use and peddling. Another was a penal code reform forbidding prosecutors to appeal against acquittals (defendants could still appeal, though). This law was not signed by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, but eventually went through both houses of parliament again, forcing the head of state to sign it. The law was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court, since the constitution of Italy provides for equal rights for prosecutors and defendants.

The son of Italian immigrants, Rollino dubbed himself the world's strongest man in the 1920s, moving with his back during the prime of his career. Early life and career Rollino was born and raised in Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York, one of 14 children. Only tall and weighing , Rollino allegedly began lifting weights in the 1920s and trained for a time with Warren Lincoln Travis.

Rollino also became known as a strongman, moving more than a ton, bending nails with his mouth and coins with his bare hands. He often appeared on the Coney Island Festival in the 1920s and 30s, being dubbed the world's strongest man. Rollino boasted of lifting with one finger. He once lifted with his teeth. After retiring from active performing, he worked as a longshoreman and once worked as a bodyguard for Greta Garbo. Rollino was a lifelong and \\"devout\\" vegetarian.Puskar-Pasewicz, Margaret.

Rollino was part of the Iceberg Athletic Club, a now-defunct swimming club, for more than 20 years. Military service  He fought in the Pacific during World War II, and was awarded a Silver Star, a Bronze Star Medal, and three Purple Hearts. \\"He saw that his men were really hurting, getting injured during a battle\\", Pete Spanakos said, \\"so he ran onto the field, grabbed two men under one arm, two under another, and brought them back behind the lines. And he did this several times.\\" Retirement Rollino lived a life of relative obscurity, rarely giving interviews or appearing in public. In a 2008 interview, he claimed to have been \\"born strong\\". He was married briefly early in his life and then divorced. He later lived with a niece. According to friends and family, he was in very good shape and was still able to bend quarters with his teeth as of his claimed 103rd birthday. Death On January 11, 2010, Rollino left his home and was hit by a vehicle in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn. He died at a hospital several hours later, aged 104.

They were very active in the UK gothic rock scene and also toured continental Europe. In 1992, after finding it increasingly difficult to gig successfully as the general interest in the gothic rock scene subsided,Mick Mercer interview in The Mick No. 52\\\\. Retrieval Date: 2010/01/15 they stopped playing as a band. The various band members continued with other projects until 2007 when, after finding each other again via a social network site, they reformed as a celebration of the 20th anniversary of Momento Mori UK.In Harm's Way CD cover History=Formation and early years (1987–1992) The band originally formed as Momento Mori - without the \\"UK\\" suffix. The suffix was later added to avoid confusion after the discovery of a Swedish band of a very similar name. The name \\"Momento Mori\\" is probably a misspelling of memento mori however, Mark Mori has claimed that it was intentional as, a button up shirt left open and worn over a Momento Mori T-shirt may reveal just \\"Omen\\". The introduction music of Momento Mori gigs at the time was the Omen theme tune (Carmina Burnana). Momento Mori were very active in the gothic rock scene and played over 200 gigs. They toured with people such as Every New Dead Ghost, Sins of the Flesh, Dream Disciples, The Marionettes, Christabelle Children, and Rosetta Stone. A tour of continental Europe culminated as headline act at a festival in Czechoslovakia. They were based in North East England and some of the band members shared a house in Billingham. Not long after having a vinyl release and being featured in a book about the scene (Gothic RockMercer, Mick (1991). Gothic Rock. Pegasus Publishing. ), they split up some time in 1992. Rebirth (2007) After Jon Mori contacted Mark Mori via Myspace, the band was reformed with three of the original members. The choice of members was dictated by geographical location. The 2007 line up was Mark Mori, Jon Mori and Roy Gibson. All three had previously played for Momento Mori. Roy had to leave early in 2008 for personal reasons and was replaced with new band member Chris Mori. A CD incorporating new songs and many of the old favourites from the previous incarnation was released on 3 December 2009 - \\"In Harm's Way\\". Mark relocated to Florida in 2010 which meant playing live was unfeasible for a while. He returned later in the year but personal circumstances saw little activity from the band. 2010 saw just one gig, a slot at Whitby Goth Weekend's Thursday night pre-festival warm up, 2011 saw no gigs and 2012 again saw just one gig in September in Nottingham with In Isolation. 2013 was more productive for the band and saw them play at Dark Waters Festival in June and another couple of shows lined up at Legends, Newcastle, supporting Cruxshadows on 5 August & Carpe Noctum at the Gasworks, Bradford, with Rhombus and The Last Cry on 11 October. A complete overhaul/reprogramming of the electronic elements of the band will coincide with the release of a downloadable remixed mini-album (as yet untitled) featuring some of the tracks from 'In Harms Way' album and maybes another surprise or two towards the end of 2013. The 30th Anniversary (Mori 2.0) (2017–present) May 2017 saw the band invited to open the first ever Marquis Masquerade Gothic Ball, in Whitby, with new lead guitarist Jono Mori. Musical style Momento Mori associate themselves with the gothic rock movement and draw most of their influences from bands of that genre. Influences include The Chameleons, The Pixies and The Sisters of Mercy.

It is a script-only based modeller that uses its own description language; parts can be previewed, but cannot be interactively selected or modified by mouse in the 3D view. An OpenSCAD script specifies geometric primitives (such as spheres, boxes, cylinders, etc.) and defines how they are modified and combined (for instance by intersection, difference, envelope combination and Minkowski sums) to render a 3D model. As such, the program does constructive solid geometry (CSG). OpenSCAD is available for Windows, Linux and OS X.  Previewing  For fast previewing of models using z-buffering, OpenSCAD employs OpenCSG and OpenGL. The 3D model position can be interactively manipulated in the view with a mouse similarly to other 3D modellers. It is also possible to define a default \\"camera\\" position in the script. Part colors can be defined in the 3D view (including transparency).Transparency is evaluated in the construction order, so a part is only transparent for parts already built. Preview is relatively fast and allows interactive modifications while modifying the script. The model renderer takes into account lighting, but the lighting source is not modifiable.  Use  OpenSCAD allows a designer to create accurate 3D models and parametric designs that can be easily adjusted by changing the parameters.. OpenSCAD documents are human-readable scripts in plain ASCII text. As such, OpenSCAD is a programmer-oriented solid-modeling tool. and has been recommended as an entry-level CAD tool for designing open-source hardware such as scientific tools for research and education.. It is mostly used to design 3D printed parts, which are exported in STL format. Animation created with OpenSCAD Animation is possible with a speed of a few images per seconds for simple models. The animation can have effect on any parameter, being it the camera position or the parts dimensions, position, shape or existence. It can be recorded as a set of images usable to build films.  Exportation  * Views can be exported in PNG format. * 2D models can be exported in AutoCAD DXF. * 3D parts can be exported in AMF, OFF, STL, as simple volumes. There is no color, material nor parts definition in the exported model (July 2016).  Importation  * 2D drawings in DXF, SVG and PNG can be imported, then extruded as monolithic parts. * 3D parts can be imported in STL and can be scaled and submitted to subtractive or additive operations.  Design  OpenSCAD is a wrapper to a CSG engine with a graphical user interface and integrated editor, developed in C++. As of 2016, it uses the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) as its basic CSG engine. Its script syntax reflects a functional programming philosophy. Much as in Haskell, within a scope each \\"variable\\" is treated as a constant, immutable with at most one value.

It is named after Gifford Pinchot, the founding Chief of the United States Forest Service and two-time Pennsylvania Governor. The Pinchot Institute for Conservation works for sustainable environment, clean water, clean air and healthy habitat through conservation thought, policy and action. Gifford Pinchot, 1909, by Pirie MacDonald, when Pinchot was the first Chief of the United States Forest Service. As Gifford Pinchot wrote in his book, Breaking New Ground, \\"Conservation is the foresighted utilization, preservation and/or renewal of forests, waters, lands and minerals for the greatest good of the greatest number for the longest time.\\" Mission The mission of the Pinchot Institute is to contribute to the conservation and sustainability of natural resource management through thought, policy and action. Through their policy initiatives, the Pinchot Institute seeks to solve conservation challenges through nonpartisan education and research. Their focus’ include Climate and energy, Water, Forests, Community Forestry and Policy. They follow in Pinchot's footsteps, and follow his belief that \\"World- wide practice of conservation and the fair and continued access by all nations to the resources they need are the two indispensable foundations of continuous plenty and of permanent peace.\\"Pinchot, Gifford. Breaking New Ground. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1947. History The idea for the Pinchot Institute came about in 1961 when Gifford Bryce Pinchot proposed to donate the Pinchot estate at Grey Towers to serve as the home of a new center for education and studies in environmental and natural resource policy. The Pinchot Institute was dedicated by President John F. Kennedy on September 24, 1963. In 1966, the U.S. Department of Interior designated Grey Towers as a National Historic Landmark. Grey Towers needed significant renovation to bring the historic home to its new role as a world-class conference center. In 1980, more than $16 million in federal, state, and private funds were raised to do so.Sample, V. Alaric and Char Miller, \\"A Transformative Place: Grey Towers and the Evolution of American Conservationism.\\" Journal of Forestry, Vol. 103, No. 5, July/August 2005. The restoration was completed in 2001 and Grey Towers reopened to the public on August 11, 2001--the 115th anniversary of the original completion of Grey Towers.Sample, V. Alaric, \\"The Pinchot Institute at 50: A Brief History.\\" It further strengthened the shared mission of the Pinchot Institute and Grey Towers to continue Gifford Pinchot’s philosophy that in order to be effective, natural resource conservation must be not only ecologically sound, but economically viable and socially responsible.Pinchot, Peter. \\"Remarks at the 30th Anniversary of the Pinchot Institute.\\" The Conservation Legacy, 1995. With the heads of the developing environmental movement appointed to the board—including Gifford Bryce Pinchot, Forest Service Chief Ed Cliff, Laurence Rockefeller, Fairfield Osborne—the Institute undertook the development of a national conservation education curriculum. After twenty years serving on the Senate staff, Jim Giltmier was selected as the first executive of the Institute. He helped to develop key statutes governing the conservation, management, and research of natural resources in the United States. Today the Pinchot Institute has grown to be an internationally recognized organization with programs and projects both nationally and abroad. Starting in 2002, the Pinchot Institute partnered with rural communities to sustainably manage tropical forests in Ecuador through their Ecomadera project. In addition to protecting tropical forests and privately owned buffer forests adjacent to globally significant biodiversity reserves, the Institute is working to provide living wages to impoverished communities. http://www.pinchot.org/gp/Ecomadera See also *Grey Towers National Historic Site ReferencesExternal links *Official website *Kennedy Dedication at Grey Towers *'The Day JFK Was Here': Pinchot Institute Dedicated 9/24/1963 (Forest History Society) Category:Nature conservation organizations based in the United States Category:Environmental organizations based in Washington, D.C.

History :... the \\"thane\\", though he later developed into a laird, was at first an officer, half royal servant and half landowner, who looked after a portion of the king's land.--J. D. Mackie, A History of Scotland; 2nd ed., rev. by Bruce Lenman & Geoffrey Parker. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1978; p. 46 The thane was introduced in the reign of David I (reigned 1124–1153), an Anglophile, to replace the Gaelic tòiseach (meaning leader, and with which the term Taoiseach shares an origin). In Scotland at that time toshach designated a deputy to a mormaer, controlling a particular portion of a mormaerdom on the mormaer's behalf. The English thegn was a more general term, simply referring to a powerful nobleman below the rank of Ealdorman (a term which had now evolved into Earl); having introduced Earl to describe mormaers, David used thane to describe toshachs. Functionally, the Thane was a territorial administrator, acting under a territorial Earl (the latter resembling a Saxon Ealdorman rather than the more superficial Norman Earl), or royal steward. Though thanes often held land within the region they administered, this was coincidental; providing land tenure was simply the way of paying for their services, the location of their lands not being intrinsically linked to the authority they wielded in any particular region. However, after the death of Alexander III in 1286, thanes differed from their tosach forebears by holding their position as a feudal grant from the crown, rather than the almost independent status held by a tosach. Thanes consequently resembled English barons, but with greater judicial and administrative authority which extended beyond the lands they directly held. In later centuries, the term thanes dropped out of use in favour of baron, but described as having regality, a term used to describe both the thanes' powers, and the greater powers of the territorial earl. Cultural associations In William Shakespeare's Macbeth (1606), the character Macbeth holds the title \\"Thane of Glamis\\", and later, \\"Thane of Cawdor\\". The historical King Macbeth fought a Thane of Cawdor who died in battle, but he did not thereby acquire the title himself. The 2nd Earl of Cawdor wrote a history of the Thanes of Cawdor, in 1742, published in 1859.

Born in Boljo-on, Cebu in 1920, Mil was from a Chinese-Spanish family of musicians. He started as the school band director of the University of San Carlos (1946–1948). He moved on to becoming a staff pianist and eventually, the Musical Director of Cebu Broadcasting Company (1948–1982). With the advent of television, he was picked as the Musical Director of Channel 7's Sali Kami (1983–1988). He was also the Band Leader of the Aristocrats Orchestra and DYRC Orchestra. During this time, his reputation for composing some of the most memorable songs in Visayan history flourished. Among the most unforgettable ones was \\"Bisan sa Damgo Lang\\", a song popularized and sung by Pilita Corrales, the Philippines' foremost female ballad singer. Mil's nine grown children and grandchildren reside in Europe, the Philippines, the U.S.A. and Canada. Mil and his wife, Enriqueta, moved to Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in 1990. Although already retired from the Philippine musical circle, Mil continued to offer his services and musical genius to the Philippine Choral group in Edmonton where, as Musical Director, he mentored and provided musical assistance, even composed songs, for their annual concerts from 1991-2000. He also led the Visayas/Mindanao Association (VISMIN) choir in Edmonton where various activities are organized by Filipinos, most notably, the Sto. Nino fiesta.

Etymology and origins Pose labelled \\"Kurmasana\\" in the 19th century Jogapradipika The name comes from the Sanskrit कूर्म Kūrma, \\"turtle\\" or \\"tortoise\\" and आसन Āsana, \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". Uttana Kurmasana is described in the ancient, c. 7th century Ahirbudhnya Saṃhitā, revised from American Academy of Religions conference, San Francisco, 19 November 2011. and illustrated in the 19th century Jogapradipika and Sritattvanidhi. The modern Kurmasana is described in B. K. S. Iyengar's 1966 Light on Yoga. Iyengar states that the asana is dedicated to Kurma, the tortoise incarnation of the god Vishnu. Description To enter kūrmāsana a practitioner sits with the legs outstretched, feet as wide apart as possible. The knees are bent slightly, keeping the heels in contact with the floor. The body is leaned forward from the hips and the hands slid under the knees. The body leans forward (bending at the hips) to allow the hands and arms to slide sideways and backward (under the knees) until the elbows lie near the back of the knees. The heels are pushed forward and legs are straightened as much as possible. The forehead or chin is brought to touch the floor. The arms are further brought around the back to interlock the hands under the buttocks. Uttana Kurmasana from the 19th century Sritattvanidhi Variations Variations of Kurmasana include: * Supta Kurmasana (Sleeping Tortoise Pose) has the forehead on the floor, the feet crossed behind the head, and the arms reaching around the legs, hands clasped behind the back. * Uttana Kurmasana (Upside-Down Tortoise Pose) has the arms threaded through the crossed legs as in Kukkutasana (Cockerel Pose), the back on the ground, and the palms of the hands on the neck.

They were expected to produce approximately 38 GWh of electricity per year. Development and Construction A planning application was submitted in August 2006 to Milton Keynes Council by Your Energy Ltd, and was granted planning permission in January 2008. The decision was challenged and upheld three separate times during 2008 by objectors to the project. It was the first wind farm challenge to go as high as the House of Lords. The main contractor for civil and electrical works was Morrison Construction, part of the Galliford Try Group. Danish company Vestas supplied the turbines, Vestas V90-2MW machines. Engineering Renewables Ltd were Project Managers for construction and operations. The turbines were delivered to the Port of Hull, where they continued their journey to Milton Keynes by road. Construction commenced in November 2009 and was completed by September 2010. Community Benefit Fund £190,000 will be contributed towards community projects over the life of the wind farm. An additional £50,000 is being directed toward improving the biodiversity of the surrounding area and local footpath networks over the first five years.

Germany (1996) 21 EHRR 205, (17851/91) was a case decided by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in 1995. The case concerned a Mrs. Vogt who was suspended from her teaching job at a public secondary school because of her past membership in the German Communist Party. The ECHR ruled that this application of Berufsverbot violated provisions in the European Convention on Human Rights relating to freedom of expression and freedom of association. Facts Mrs. D. Vogt joined the German Communist Party in 1972 (Para. 18). In 1977, she became a language teacher at a public secondary school and, correspondingly, a probationary civil servant. In 1979, she was appointed a permanent public servant (Para. 9). In 1986, Mrs. Vogt was suspended based on Berufsverbot (Para. 16). The German courts considered her dismissal to be legal, considering GCP's aims anti-constitutional and active membership in GCP incompatible with a civil servant's duty of loyalty (Para. 18-23). In 1990, Lower Saxony cancelled its decree on employment of extremists in the civil service (Para. 32.), and, in 1991, Mrs. Vogt was reinstated (Para. 24). In 1991, an application was lodged before the European Commission of Human Rights (Para. 1.). In 1992, it was declared admissible. In 1993, the Commission held in its report, by 13 votes to 1, that Articles 10 (freedom of expression) and 11 (freedom of association) of the European Convention on Human Rights were violated, but the complaints under Article 14 (ban of discrimination in enjoying Convention rights) were not necessary to examine (Para. 95-97 of the Report). Judgment The Grand Chamber of the ECtHR held in 1995, by 10 votes to 9, that Articles 10 and 11 of the ECHR were violated, considering the dismissal disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (Para. 68). The court underlined that It also held unanimously that it was not necessary to examine the case under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 10, since this complaint was not raised by Mrs Vogt at court. Judges Bernhardt, Gölcüklü, Matscher, Loizou, Mifsud Bonnici, Gotchev, Jungwiert, Kūris and Jambrek filed dissenting opinions, finding no violation in the case.

Its aim was to support the Chadian army in protecting N'Djamena from the FROLINAT.  History  Opération Tacaud was triggered by the capture of Faya-Largeau by the FROLINAT on 17 February 1978, opening the road to N'Djamena, capital of Chad. France decided to send in troops to support the Chadian army, as had been previously done with Opération Bison a few years before.  Order of battle  Intervention was carried out by entirely professional units of the French Army, belonging to the 9th Marine Infantry Brigade. The 3rd RIMa was sent in its entirety, along with * a battery of the 11th RAMa, * a squadron of the RIMC * a squadron of the 1st REC * two companies of the 2nd REP * one motorised company of the 1st RE The Navy offered one Breguet Atlantic plane for intelligence gathering, as well as naval commandos who were deployed at N'Djamena International Airport. The Air Force offered eight SEPECAT Jaguar attack planes and a number of Transall aircraft for transport. Furthermore, two units of the 11th Parachute Division, the 2nd REP and the 35th RAP, were put in alert for possible deployment. Deployment  The French Army already had men deployed in Chad, as personnel of the Marine Infantry were present for military counselling to the Chadian Army. On 20 April, these troops received reinforcements with the first company of the 1st REC, equipped with Panhard AML armoured cars; one command platoon; and one mechanised platoon under captain Yvanoff. The 2nd squadron of the RIMC followed shortly thereafter.  Operations  The first clashes occurred in Salal, where the French routed a FROLINAT group. On 18 and 19 May, the Chadian 1st Infantry regiment had to rescue Chadian gendarmes surrounded by rebels in Ati. A squadron of the 1er REC tried to join the fight from Mussoro, but was unable to reach the battle. The 3rd company of the 3rd RIMa also joined in, from Mongo; as they approached Ati, the marsouins found themselves under heavy fire and had to call in air support, provided by the Jaguars. On 19, reinforcements of the REC arrived. The next day, the Jaguars softened FROLINAT positions, which were them stormed and taken. The rebels disengaged and regrouped in Jeddah, 45 km North of Ati, from where they threatened the town. The French decided to raid the rebels in Jeddah to prevent another attack on Ati. On 31 May, two companies of the 3rd RIMa and a squadron of the 1st REC, supported by a battery of the 11th RAMa and the Jaguars, stormed the city. FROLINAT opened fire with small arm and Strela 2 fire, managing to shoot down one of the Jaguars with machine gun fire. Fighting lasted for 6 hours before the FROLINAT was routed. After the battle of Jeddah, it took then months for the FROLINAT to reconstitute a fighting force capable of attacking a town. On 5 March 1979, it attacked and occupied Abéché. The 3rd RIMa, the RIMC and the 11th RAMa had to intervene again.  Results  Opération Tacaud lost 18 killed and two downed Jaguars to the French. Professional units rotated in Chad until May 1980. The experience gathered during the operation started the trend of professionalisation of the Army.les cahiers du retex, page 39  Sources and references  * Category:History of Chad Category:Military operations involving France ","title":"Opération Tacaud"},{"id":"25778497","text":"Bank Buildings is a historical construction on a corner site at 1–7 Charing Cross, Birkenhead, Wirral, Merseyside, England. It consists of offices and shops which extend towards the north along Exmouth Street and towards the west along Grange Road West. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The building was constructed in 1901 for the Bank of Liverpool. The part of the building on the corner was occupied by the bank and this was flanked by shops on both sides. It was designed by the Chester architects Douglas and Minshull, and the corner building was later occupied by Martins Bank. By the early 2000s the corner building was being used for offices and a shop, and the rest of the building continues to be occupied by other shops. Architecture Bank Buildings is Gothic in style. It is constructed mainly in ashlar stone with some brickwork, and with roofs of Westmorland green slate. The former bank building stands on the corner of the streets and is symmetrical in three storeys with three bays. The central bay has an arched doorway with a three-light mullioned and transomed window in the middle storey. The top storey contains a three-light mullioned window, over which is a gable. In the middle storey on each side of the window is a niche with a crocketted spire containing a statue. The lateral bays have a two-light arched window on the ground floor. Above these rises a two-story canted turret carried on corbels. In each storey are four-light windows, similar in type to those in the central bay. At the top of each is a conical roof with a finial. At the summit of this section of the building is a hipped roof containing two small dormers. To the right of the section is a circular stair tower rising higher than the turrets, with stair windows, and three lancet windows under a conical roof with a finial. To the right of the central section, along Exmouth Street, is a row of four shops, stepped downhill, that are all similar to each other. They have two storeys, the lower storey being in brick with stone dressings, and the upper storey in stone. The lower storey has a modern shop front under an elliptical arch. The upper storey contains three pairs of two-light mullioned and transomed windows. Along the top of the front is a balustraded parapet on corbels. The roof is steeply pitched and has two small dormers. To the left of the central section along Grange Road West are two two-storey shops, similar to each other, with modern shop fronts on the ground floor under elliptical arches. In the upper storey of each are three pairs of two-light mullioned and transomed windows. Above these is a gable containing a single-light window and brick diapering over which is stone coping. Inside the corner section is an octagonal hall, formerly the banking hall. The citation in the National Heritage List for England describes the building as \\"a varied and lively treatment of an important corner site\\".

Robert Schatten was a born to a Jewish family in Lviv. His intellectual origins were at Lwów School of Mathematics, particularly well known for fundamental contributions to functional analysis. His entire family was murdered during World War II, he himself emigrated to the United States. In 1933 he got magister degree at Jan Kazimierz University of Lwów, and in 1939 he got master's degree at Columbia University. Supervised by Francis Joseph Murray, he got doctorate degree in 1942 for the thesis \\"On the Direct Product of Banach Spaces\\". Shortly after being appointed to a junior professorship, he joined the United States army where during training he suffered a back injury which affected him for the remainder of his life. In 1943 he was appointed to an assistant professorship at University of Vermont. At National Research Council, by two years he worked with John von Neumann and Nelson Dunford. In 1946, he went to Kansas University, first as extraordinary professor until 1952 and then as ordinary professor until 1961. He stayed at Institute for Advanced Study in 1950 and 1952–1953, at University of Southern California in 1960–1961, and at State University of New York in 1961–1962. In 1962 he became professor at Hunter College, where he stayed until his death. Schatten widely studied tensor products of Banach spaces. In functional analysis, he is the namesake of the Schatten norm and the Schatten class operators. His doctoral students included Elliott Ward Cheney, Jr. at University of Kansas, and Peter Falley and Charles Masiello at City University of New York. Schatten died in New York City in 1977.

He was assassinated on the morning of 12 January 2010 (some minutes before 8 o'clock, local time) in front of his home in Tehran, while leaving for university.

According to Time magazine, Western intelligence confirmed that the confession of Majid Jamali Fashi was genuine. Alimohammadi was the first PhD graduate student in physics of the Sharif University of Technology. He published some 53 articles and letters in peer-reviewed academic journalsList of publications of Professor Masoud Alimohammadi as presented on the website of Department of Physics of University of Tehran: . and wrote and translated several physics textbooks, including Modern Quantum Mechanics, revised edition, by J. J. Sakurai, which he translated from English into Persian in collaboration with Hamidreza Moshfegh. Education He entered Shiraz University in 1978 where he obtained his BSc in 1985. He subsequently moved to the Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, to study for his MSc in Physics. In 1988 he began with his PhD studies at this University as one of its first PhD students in physics. He obtained his PhD there in 1992. Research and achievements He was a quantum field theorist with interests in such diverse fields as Condensed matter physics (Quantum Hall effect in curved geometries), cosmology (modified gravity, dark energy, etc.) and string theory. Quantum field theory is a subject matter quite distinct from nuclear physics, nuclear engineering in general, and nuclear weapons and nuclear power. Iran's Atomic Energy Agency has in an official statement rejected media reports that Alimohammadi was associated with Iran's nuclear program.Alimohammadi was not employed by us, in Persian, Tābnāk, 12 January 2010 . However, in an interview published in the Christian Science Monitor in July 2014, his widow Mansoureh Karami spoke of his \\"top secret nuclear work\\".\\"Covert war against Iran's nuclear scientists: a widow remembers\\", Christian Science Monitor, 17 July 2014. Retrieved 18 July 2014 Alimohammadi was a Council Member of International Centre for Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science Applications in the Middle East. He was a professor at Tehran University's Physics faculty. Some sites claimed he was a professor at Imam Hossein University.DAWN.COM but Iranian analyst Muhammad Sahimi writes \\"He was not affiliated with the IRGC-controlled universities, namely Malek-e Ashtar and Emam Hossein universities.\\" Political views Ali Moghari, the director of the science department of Tehran University, described Mr. Ali Mohammadi as an \\"apolitical professor\\". \\"He was a well-known professor but was not politically active.\\" Ahmad Shirzad (reformist member of the 6th Iranian Parliament, professor of physics in Isfahan and Masoud Alimohammadi's close friend) writes \\"In general his beliefs and actions were close to that of moderate Muslims. ... During the past couple of years he had ideologically become very close to the reformist movement. In the past few elections before the recent presidency election, he had voted for the reformist candidates and had been campaigning for them too.\\" Shirzad adds that Alimohammadi told him how he and his students took part in 2009 Iranian election protests, 16 June. The governmental media portrayed him as a \\"revolutionary and staunch supporter of Islamic Revolution\\". It was claimed by Tehran University's Basij, or voluntary Islamist student militia, that his name was on a list of sanctioned individuals connected with Iranian nuclear program. but, he was not on a compiled list. Mohammadi was among 240 university professors who signed a letter before the 2009 Presidential Election expressing support for the main opposition candidate, Mir Hossein Moussavi. On reporting his burial, Al Jazeera reported on his lack of political involvement deepening the confusion over what motivation could have been behind the murder. They reported, \\"one of Ali Mohammadi's close friends (was quoted) as saying that the professor was never a political activist,\\" and that, \\"... Mohammadi had very deep reformist tendencies but never mixed it up with his professional character.\\" Ali Moghara, who heads the physics faculty at Tehran University, said Ali Mohammadi was just a \\"world famous\\" physicist who engaged in \\"no political activity\\". Personal life He was married to Mansoureh Karami (Persian: منصوره كرمی) before his assassination. Assassination At 07:58 am, a booby-trapped motorbike parked near his car exploded while he was leaving home in Gheytariyeh neighbourhood of northern Tehran, for university. The windows of residences around the scientist's home were shattered by the force of remote controlled explosion, and it was reported that two other people were also injured in the blast. Iranian state media accused Israel, and the US of responsibility, while the US State Department called the allegation \\"absurd\\".Israel and US behind Tehran blast – Iranian state media, BBC, 13 January 2010 Ynetnews stated that \\"there is no known connection between his participation\\" in the SESAME, an international synchrotron-radiation facility located in Jordan, and the assassination. According to US intelligence sources, Israel is running a secret war against Iran, among techniques used are the killing of important persons in the Iranian atomic energy program. Another source found the assassination of \\"a 50-year-old researcher with no prominent political voice, no published work with military relevance and no declared links to Iran's nuclear program\\", as puzzling, although there were comparisons with the disappearance of Shahram Amiri in 2009 and the death of Ardeshir Hosseinpour in 2007.Iran Nuclear Physicist, Massoud Ali Mohammadi, Killed By Bomb 12 January 2010 On 25 January 2010, Iran summoned the Swiss ambassador to Iran, who is representing the interests of United States in Iran, demanding the extradition of individuals associated with U.S. based Tondar group, whom Iran believes are behind the bombing.

Timesonline described it as \\"Supporters of Iran’s regime hijacked the funeral.\\" As his body was carried from his home in northern Tehran hundreds of government loyalists surrounded it and were shown on Iranian state television waving Iranian flags and chanting anti-American and anti-Israeli slogans.Funeral of Iran scientist Masoud Ali-Mohammadi hijacked by regime loyalists 15 January 2010 State investigation The Iranian government has initiated an investigation and termed the blast a \\"terror attack with the aim of stalling Iranian scientific progress\\". Iran's Press TV quoted the ministry spokesman Ramin Mehman-Parast, \\"Primary investigations into the assassination revealed signs of the involvement of the Zionist regime of Israel, the US and their allies in Iran.\\" In the same article a professor at Tehran University is quoted as having said, \\"It is widely believed among colleagues that he was assassinated by terrorist organizations probably supported by the United States and with connections with the Americans and the Israelis under different names.\\" On 13 January 2010, Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani said, \\"We had received information a few days before the incident that intelligence services of the Zionist regime of Israel intend to carry out terrorist acts in Tehran in cooperation with the CIA of the US.\\" Twenty-four- year-old Majid Jamali Fashi was arrested days after the killing, and in January 2011, Iranian state television aired a confession by Fashi to having killed Alimohammadi on behalf of Mossad. Fashi's arrest may have come as a result of a September 2009 WikiLeaks diplomatic cable from the US Embassy in Baku, Azerbaijan. The cable quoted an Iranian source who was a licensed martial arts coach who was in contact with the Americans. Fashi was reportedly in Baku to participate in an international martial arts competition days before the cable was written.http://www.timesofisrael.com/wikileaks-report- may-have-doomed-iranian-mossad-agent/ On 28 August 2011, Fashi was convicted and sentenced to death by the Islamic Revolutionary Court. He was hanged on 15 May 2012 at Tehran's Evin Prison. Media speculation According to television network Press TV, The Iran Royal Association, an \\"obscure\\" group seeking the restoration of the monarchy, claimed that its \\"Tondar Commandos\\" are behind the assassination. The BBC's Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne claimed \\"Iranian media were unusually quick off the mark to report the killing, to show television pictures, and to give the sort of details that usually only emerge after hours, days, or weeks in this secretive state\\". An anonymous former senior official expressed doubt about the official account of Alimohammadi's assassination, and expressed concern that the assassination could be used as an excuse for violence against opposition protesters: \\"This is an old trick. ... They did it themselves but blame it on opposition groups so that they can easily begin issuing death sentences for protesters. I think this means there could be more violence against the opposition.\\" (See False flag) Opposition groups who monitor Hezbollah, the militant Lebanese movement, in Tehran, claim that a member of Hezbollah, known by his pseudonym \\"Abu Nasser\\", was photographed at the scene of the explosion in Tehran's affluent Gheytarih suburb. According to Iranian-Israeli analyst Meir Javedanfar, It is \\"possible that Mohammadi was assassinated by a foreign intelligence agency\\" with the aim of stopping the Iranian nuclear program and also causing embarrassment for the government of Ahmadinejad. Flynt Leverett, director of New America Foundation, said that while it is \\"highly unlikely that the United States was directly involved\\" in the assassination, it is \\"possible that a group or an individual\\" who received financial support as part of the $400 million US covert activities program initiated under Bush administration against Iran, might have carried out the assassination. However, Iranian analyst Muhammad Sahimi thinks it unlikely that the murder was directed against Iran's nuclear program as it is engineers, not nuclear physicists, who are \\"leading\\" that program, and in any case Alimohammadi's research was in the general area of particle physics, \\"which is of a fundamental, rather than practical nature\\". Ali-Mohammadi was also not under contract with Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, according to its spokesman Ali Shirzadian, nor was he affiliated with the universities under the control of the Revolutionary Guard (Malek-Ashtar University of Technology and Imam Hossein University).Who murdered Prof. Ali-Mohammadi? Muhammad Sahimi, 13 January 2010 On the other hand, \\"a source in Tehran\\" told Sahimi that Alimohammadi had worked with the Islamic Revolution Guards \\"on several projects in the past,\\" and this knowledge combined with the Guard's penchant for exacting vengeance against \\"anyone who deserts them and joins the opposition\\" adds to \\"the suspicion that the hardliners may have had something to do with\\" his murder. Al Jazeera reported that authorities on condition of anonymity have confirmed his involvement with Iranian nuclear program. The Economist also quoted anonymous Western sources describing him as \\"one of the most important people involved in the [nuclear] programme\\". It was also reported that he was a professor at Tehran University's Physics faculty as well as a professor at the IRGC run, Imam Hossein University which houses a physics research center apparently under control of the IRGC. There were also reports of a decapitation program as part of a covert war against Iran, with the aim of assassinating people that are or have been involved with Iranian nuclear program, much like a similar successful program conducted in Iraq, resulting in assassination of hundreds of Iraqi scientists. There were also reports of Israel's involvement in these covert actions, while other reports suggested the creation of a joint assassination team put together by western democracies to neutralize Iranian scientists and engineers. An article in Time magazine claimed that a Western intelligence source confirmed the truth of the confession of Majid Jamali Fashid, who said he assassinated Masoud Alimohammadi on behalf of Mossad, Israel. The source confirmed that Iranian intelligence has cracked one cell trained and equipped by Mossad, and blamed a \\"third country\\" for exposing the cell.

Cosmic background radiation is electromagnetic radiation from the Big Bang. The origin of this radiation depends on the region of the spectrum that is observed. One component is the cosmic microwave background. This component is redshifted photons that have freely streamed from an epoch when the Universe became transparent for the first time to radiation. Its discovery and detailed observations of its properties are considered one of the major confirmations of the Big Bang. The discovery (by chance in 1965) of the cosmic background radiation suggests that the early universe was dominated by a radiation field, a field of extremely high temperature and pressure. The Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect shows the phenomena of radiant cosmic background radiation interacting with \\"electron\\" clouds distorting the spectrum of the radiation. There is also background radiation in the infrared, x-rays, etc., with different causes, and they can sometimes be resolved into an individual source.

Biography Renaat Braem was born in Antwerp in 1910. He graduated as an architect from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp in 1935, with a constructivism-inspired design for a linear city between Antwerp and Liège. He received the biannual Prix Godecharle the same year. Braem used the money of the award to study abroad, working at the studio of Le Corbusier in 1936 and 1937. He became a member of the Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne in 1937, and his first architectural realisations in these pre-war years were rooted firmly in the new \\"modern\\" style. He became one of Belgium's most prominent architects in the early 1950s, when he received two commissions from the city council of Antwerp: the development of the Administratif Center in the heart of the city, and a social housing project in Het Kiel, a neighborhood in the suburbs. The Administratif Center was only partly realised ten years later, and the one tower that was actually built in the end became the Police Tower, the headquarters of the Antwerp police force. The social housing project though became a landmark in the history of social housing in Belgium and one of the most important architectural realisations of the 1950s. Over the next two decades, Braem created many projects, ranging from private buildings to large scale housing complexes in Leuven, Brussels, Deurne and Boom. His work was faithful to the Athens Charter of the CIAM until the late 1960s, when his work became less rigid and more organic. Braem was also an important figure in the study and debate of modern architecture in Belgium, cofounding important magazines like Plan, Architecture, or Bouwen en Wonen, writing articles, and being interviewed for radio, television and newspapers. He was one of the oginators of the Bouwcentrum in Antwerp, which tried to promote the industrialisation of the work of building through education and prototyping. In 1968, he wrote Het lelijkste land ter wereld (\\"The most ugly country in the world\\"), an essay against the postwar spatial planning of Belgium with an ecological warning as well. Renaat Braem published his memoirs Het schoonste land ter wereld (The most beautiful country in the world) in 1987. He moved to a nursing home in 1997. His private home, built in 1955, and all its contents (archive, library, furniture) was legated to the Flemish Community in 1999. He died in 2001 in Essen. His house was transformed into a museum, the second of its kind in Belgium after the Horta Museum in Brussels. An exhibition on the life and work of Renaat Braem took place in 2010, to celebrate his centenary. The rectorate of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel Major works * House P.

It was created in 2009 as part of the Newton-Arkwright regeneration development at Nottingham Trent University and designed by Hopkins Architects. Housed in the Grade II listed Newton Building, Nottingham Conference Centre offers modern conference facilities in a beautiful architectural setting. As well as a wide range of meeting rooms, they also have event management, audio-visual, wedding and catering facilities on offer. It features 8 fully equipped conference rooms with a range of different capacities. From large tiered and flat floor lecture theatres for up to 450 delegates, to purpose-built conference rooms for 150 delegates. They also offer a range of flexible boardrooms, meeting rooms and break-out areas more appropriate for smaller conference events and meetings. They also have event management, audio-visual, wedding and catering facilities on offer. History Nottingham Conference Centre was created in 2010 following a multimillion-pound refurbishment of two of Nottingham Trent University's Grade II* listed buildings, Newton and Arkwright. The Centre's three Victorian character rooms are situated in the Arkwright building, originally built between 1877 and 1881 by Lockwood and Mawson, the prominent Yorkshire architectural practice founded by Henry Francis Lockwood. The foundation stone was laid on 27 September 1877 by the Lord Mayor of Nottingham, Alderman Bowers. The Old Chemistry Theatre, now beautifully restored, saw the discovery of silicone polymers by Frederick Kipping in the late 19th century. The Old Library was once the original city library and the Old Museum housed a natural history collection which included the stuffed gorilla now relocated to nearby Wollaton Hall. In 1908, English poet DH Lawrence received his teaching certificate after studying in the Arkwright building. In his novel The Rainbow (1915) Lawrence drew on his own memories of Arkwright for Ursula Brangwen's first impressions of University College,http://www.ntu.ac.uk/about_ntu/strategy/history/index.html History of NTU, Nottingham Trent University with the lines: “The big college built of stone, standing in the quiet street, with a rim of grass and lime-trees all so peaceful: she felt it remote, a magic-land.” A World War II bombing raid in 1941 destroyed large parts of the Arkwright building, but it was restored to its former glory after the war and was granted status as a listed building in 1972. Originally, the Newton building was the architectural response to rapidly expanding student numbers in an optimistic post-war climate for British higher education. This striking art-deco building was constructed between 1956 and 1958. It was designed by Thomas Cecil Howitt, the most prolific and versatile Nottingham architect of the first half of the 20th Century, and one of the most prominent provincial English architects of his generation. In April 1998, the Newton building was handed a very special 40th anniversary present when it was given a Grade II* listing; recognised by the Government as one of England's architectural gems. The building now features over 3000m2of sedum roof, one of the largest green roofs in the country. A pair of breeding peregrine falcons live on the Newton Building roof during the spring and summer months and the Newton Arkwright building was officially opened by Sir David Attenboroughhttp://www.ntu.ac.uk/apps/news/107445-25/Sir_David_Attenborough_officially_opens_NTU%E2%80%99s_iconic_buildings.aspx Sir David Attenborough officially opens NTU’s iconic buildings in May 2011.

After her death, he was married to another Sarah Jowitt (born Storer, 1762–1799). There were no children from either marriage. His father had been a grocer and Samuel continued this business. Fox was renowned for serving all in strict order and tales are told of him turning back those who thought themselves too important to queue. Fox's premises were run on strict principles even having separate men's and ladies counters, with staff of the appropriate gender.

Philanthropy=Adult School Samuel Fox is credited with helping to start the first 'adult school' in 1798 in partnership with a Methodist named William Singleton. Initially the classes were for young women from local lace and hosiery factories.quakers and adult schools , infed.org. Retrieved January 2010 William Singleton, a Methodist, originally started the school, but it was Fox and the staff from his grocer's shop that maintained it. Fox's staff were expected to teach at this school and Fox provided breakfast at 9 a.m. on a Sunday after they had completed two hours of teaching. The school grew to include men, but it was said that Fox was specifically interested in improving adult education. Lessons are believed to have started with a Bible reading, but the book was then used as a textbook to enable scholars to practise reading and writing. In 1830, Louisa M Woods, started a savings scheme for pupils. Fox conducted lessons for three mornings a week for students of more advanced arithmetic and he would fund some to go to become teachers themselves. In 1842, Joseph Sturge visited Nottingham, as he was local parliamentary candidate. Whilst there he visited the school run by Fox and his staff. The idea of a school that taught not only scripture, but also basic skills such as reading and writing was taken up by Sturge. Sturge opened a similar school, in Birmingham, in about 1845. Fox in 1840 in a detail from the Anti-Slavery Convention painting. Cholera epidemic There was a major cholera outbreak in Nottingham in 1832 and a Nottingham Board of Health was formed. Although official sounding the Board of Health had no authority. It was concerned with the well being of the inhabitants and Fox and Robert W. Willson were key members. Three hundred people were to die in the outbreak. The burial of their bodies was a major problem as one cemetery was full and the other had local objectors who were afraid of the effect of cholera victims on their families health. It was Fox who bought and provided land for the cemetery. It is now officially called St Mary's Rest Garden but it is still known locally as \\"Foxes Close\\".Victoria Park and St Mary's Rest Garden, Nottingham City Council. Retrieved January 2010 Willson was given the freedom of the city and went on to inspire the construction of Nottingham Cathedral and he became the first Bishop of Hobart. Fox allowed for the land to be consecrated as St Annes Cemetery in 1835 by William Howley, the Archbishop of Canterbury. This consecration prevented the funeral services of people who were not members of the Church of England. Fox and Willson were amongst many who could not use the burial ground. The injustice of the situation regarding St Anne's burial ground was apparent and a group was formed that included Fox that petitioned parliament to allow the land to be divided into land for the Church of England and another area for dissenters. The cemetery did have that change of use but it took an Act of Parliament to achieve this. Abolition of Slavery Fox attended the week-long World Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840. He was captured in a portrait with other Quakers like Josiah Forster, businessmen like Tapper Cadbury, bankers such as George Head Head and other prominent abolitionists from a number of countries including America, South Africa and Jamaica. The meeting had been organised by Joseph Sturge from Birmingham. Samuel Fox became one of the Secretaries of the Nottingham Anti- Slavery Society. Famines Nottingham had famines in 1847, 1848 and 1849 and Fox again helped. Fox obtained maize flour which his customers had never seen or used before. Fox sold large quantities of the flour at two pence per pound less than he bought if for.

Kuhn made several claims concerning the progress of scientific knowledge: that scientific fields undergo periodic \\"paradigm shifts\\" rather than solely progressing in a linear and continuous way, and that these paradigm shifts open up new approaches to understanding what scientists would never have considered valid before; and that the notion of scientific truth, at any given moment, cannot be established solely by objective criteria but is defined by a consensus of a scientific community. Competing paradigms are frequently incommensurable; that is, they are competing and irreconcilable accounts of reality. Thus, our comprehension of science can never rely wholly upon \\"objectivity\\" alone. Science must account for subjective perspectives as well, since all objective conclusions are ultimately founded upon the subjective conditioning/worldview of its researchers and participants. Life Kuhn was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Samuel L. Kuhn, an industrial engineer, and Minette Stroock Kuhn, both Jewish.http://www.jinfo.org/Philosophers.html From kindergarten through fifth grade, he was educated at Lincoln School, a private progressive school in Manhattan, which stressed independent thinking rather than learning facts and subjects. The family then moved 40 miles north to the small town of Croton-on-Hudson where, once again, he attended a private progressive school – Hessian Hills School. It was here that, in sixth through ninth grade, he learned to love mathematics. He left Hessian Hills in 1937. He graduated from The Taft School in Watertown, CT, in 1940. He obtained his BSc degree in physics from Harvard College in 1943, where he also obtained MSc and PhD degrees in physics in 1946 and 1949, respectively, under the supervision of John Van Vleck.The title of his doctoral thesis was The Cohesive Energy of Monovalent Metals as a Function of Their Atomic Quantum Defects . As he states in the first few pages of the preface to the second edition of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, his three years of total academic freedom as a Harvard Junior Fellow were crucial in allowing him to switch from physics to the history and philosophy of science. He later taught a course in the history of science at Harvard from 1948 until 1956, at the suggestion of university president James Conant. After leaving Harvard, Kuhn taught at the University of California, Berkeley, in both the philosophy department and the history department, being named Professor of the History of science in 1961. Kuhn interviewed and tape recorded Danish physicist Niels Bohr the day before Bohr's death. At Berkeley, he wrote and published (in 1962) his best known and most influential work: The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. In 1964, he joined Princeton University as the M. Taylor Pyne Professor of Philosophy and History of Science. He served as the president of the History of Science Society from 1969–70.The History of Science Society \\"The Society: Past Presidents of the History of Science Society\\" . Retrieved December 4, 2013 In 1979 he joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as the Laurance S. Rockefeller Professor of Philosophy, remaining there until 1991. In 1994 Kuhn was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died in 1996. Thomas Kuhn was married twice, first to Kathryn Muhs with whom he had three children, then to Jehane Barton Burns (Jehane R. Kuhn). The Structure of Scientific Revolutions The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (SSR) was originally printed as an article in the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science, published by the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle. In this book, Kuhn argued that science does not progress via a linear accumulation of new knowledge, but undergoes periodic revolutions, also called \\"paradigm shifts\\" (although he did not coin the phrase, he did contribute to its increase in popularity), in which the nature of scientific inquiry within a particular field is abruptly transformed. In general, science is broken up into three distinct stages. Prescience, which lacks a central paradigm, comes first. This is followed by \\"normal science\\", when scientists attempt to enlarge the central paradigm by \\"puzzle-solving\\". Guided by the paradigm, normal science is extremely productive: \\"when the paradigm is successful, the profession will have solved problems that its members could scarcely have imagined and would never have undertaken without commitment to the paradigm\\". In regard to experimentation and collection of data with a view toward solving problems through the commitment to a paradigm, Kuhn states: \\"The operations and measurements that a scientist undertakes in the laboratory are not 'the given' of experience but rather 'the collected with difficulty.' They are not what the scientist sees—at least not before his research is well advanced and his attention focused. Rather, they are concrete indices to the content of more elementary perceptions, and as such they are selected for the close scrutiny of normal research only because they promise opportunity for the fruitful elaboration of an accepted paradigm. Far more clearly than the immediate experience from which they in part derive, operations and measurements are paradigm- determined. Science does not deal in all possible laboratory manipulations. Instead, it selects those relevant to the juxtaposition of a paradigm with the immediate experience that that paradigm has partially determined. As a result, scientists with different paradigms engage in different concrete laboratory manipulations.\\"https://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf During the period of normal science, the failure of a result to conform to the paradigm is seen not as refuting the paradigm, but as the mistake of the researcher, contra Popper's falsifiability criterion. As anomalous results build up, science reaches a crisis, at which point a new paradigm, which subsumes the old results along with the anomalous results into one framework, is accepted. This is termed revolutionary science. In SSR, Kuhn also argues that rival paradigms are incommensurable—that is, it is not possible to understand one paradigm through the conceptual framework and terminology of another rival paradigm. For many critics, for example David Stove (Popper and After, 1982), this thesis seemed to entail that theory choice is fundamentally irrational: if rival theories cannot be directly compared, then one cannot make a rational choice as to which one is better. Whether Kuhn's views had such relativistic consequences is the subject of much debate; Kuhn himself denied the accusation of relativism in the third edition of SSR, and sought to clarify his views to avoid further misinterpretation. Freeman Dyson has quoted Kuhn as saying \\"I am not a Kuhnian!\\", referring to the relativism that some philosophers have developed based on his work. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is the single most widely cited book in the social sciences. The enormous impact of Kuhn's work can be measured in the changes it brought about in the vocabulary of the philosophy of science: besides \\"paradigm shift\\", Kuhn popularized the word \\"paradigm\\" itself from a term used in certain forms of linguistics and the work of Georg Lichtenberg to its current broader meaning, coined the term \\"normal science\\" to refer to the relatively routine, day-to- day work of scientists working within a paradigm, and was largely responsible for the use of the term \\"scientific revolutions\\" in the plural, taking place at widely different periods of time and in different disciplines, as opposed to a single scientific revolution in the late Renaissance. The frequent use of the phrase \\"paradigm shift\\" has made scientists more aware of and in many cases more receptive to paradigm changes, so that Kuhn's analysis of the evolution of scientific views has by itself influenced that evolution. Kuhn's work has been extensively used in social science; for instance, in the post- positivist/positivist debate within International Relations. Kuhn is credited as a foundational force behind the post-Mertonian sociology of scientific knowledge. Kuhn's work has also been used in the Arts and Humanities, such as by Matthew Edward Harris to distinguish between scientific and historical communities (such as political or religious groups): 'political-religious beliefs and opinions are not epistemologically the same as those pertaining to scientific theories'. This is because would-be scientists' worldviews are changed through rigorous training, through the engagement between what Kuhn calls 'exemplars' and the Global Paradigm. Kuhn's notions of paradigms and paradigm shifts have been influential in understanding the history of economic thought, for example the Keynesian revolution,E.g. Ghanshyam Mehta, The Structure of the Keynesian Revolution, London, 1977 and in debates in political science.E.g. Alan Ryan, \\"Paradigms Lost: How Oxford Escaped the Paradigm Wars of the 1960s and 1970s', in Christopher Hood, Desmond King, & Gillian Peele, eds, Forging a Discipline, Oxford University Press, 2014. A defense Kuhn gives against the objection that his account of science from The Structure of Scientific Revolutions results in relativism can be found in an essay by Kuhn called \\"Objectivity, Value Judgment, and Theory Choice.\\" In this essay, he reiterates five criteria from the penultimate chapter of SSR that determine (or help determine, more properly) theory choice: # Accurate – empirically adequate with experimentation and observation # Consistent – internally consistent, but also externally consistent with other theories # Broad Scope – a theory's consequences should extend beyond that which it was initially designed to explain # Simple – the simplest explanation, principally similar to Occam's razor # Fruitful – a theory should disclose new phenomena or new relationships among phenomena He then goes on to show how, although these criteria admittedly determine theory choice, they are imprecise in practice and relative to individual scientists. According to Kuhn, \\"When scientists must choose between competing theories, two men fully committed to the same list of criteria for choice may nevertheless reach different conclusions.\\" For this reason, the criteria still are not \\"objective\\" in the usual sense of the word because individual scientists reach different conclusions with the same criteria due to valuing one criterion over another or even adding additional criteria for selfish or other subjective reasons. Kuhn then goes on to say, \\"I am suggesting, of course, that the criteria of choice with which I began function not as rules, which determine choice, but as values, which influence it.\\" Because Kuhn utilizes the history of science in his account of science, his criteria or values for theory choice are often understood as descriptive normative rules (or more properly, values) of theory choice for the scientific community rather than prescriptive normative rules in the usual sense of the word \\"criteria\\", although there are many varied interpretations of Kuhn's account of science. Post-Structure Philosophy Years after the publication of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn dropped the concept of a paradigm and began to focus on the semantic aspects of scientific theories. In particular, Kuhn focuses on the taxonomic structure of scientific kind terms. As a consequence, a scientific revolution is not defined as a 'change of paradigm' anymore, but rather as a change in the taxonomic structure of the theoretical language of science.Kuhn, T., 2000 The Road since Structure, University of Chicago Press Some scholars describe this change as resulting from a 'linguistic turn'.Irzik, G., Grünberg, T., 1998, Whorfian variations on Kantian themes: Kuhn's linguistic turn, Studies in History and Philosophy of Science 29: 207-221 Bird, A., 2002, Kuhn’s wrong turning, Studies in History and Philosophy of Science 33: 443-463 In their book, Andersen, Barker and Chen use some recent theories in cognitive psychology to vindicate Kuhn's mature philosophy.Andersen, H., Barker, P., and Chen, X., The Cognitive Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Cambridge University Press, 2006 Apart from dropping the concept of a paradigm, Kuhn also began to look at the process of scientific specialisation. In a scientific revolution, a new paradigm (or a new taxonomy) replaces the old one; by contrast, specialisation leads to a proliferation of new specialties and disciplines. This attention to the proliferation of specialties would make Kuhn's model less 'revolutionary' and more 'evolutionary'. Some philosophers claim that Kuhn attempted to describe different kinds of scientific change: revolutions and specialty-creation.Wray, K. Brad, Kuhn's Evolutionary Social Epistemology, Cambridge University Press, 2011 Others claim that the process of specialisation is in itself a special case of scientific revolutions.Politi, V., 2018 Scientific revolutions, specialization and the discovery of the structure of DNA: toward a new picture of the development of the sciences, Synthese195: 2267–2293 It is also possible to argue that, in Kuhn's model, science evolves through revolutions.Kuukkanen, J.M., 2012 Revolution as Evolution: The Concept of Evolution in Kuhn’s Philosophy, in Kindi, V., Arabatsis, T. (Eds.) Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions Revisited Polanyi–Kuhn debate Although they used different terminologies, both Kuhn and Michael Polanyi believed that scientists' subjective experiences made science a relativized discipline. Polanyi lectured on this topic for decades before Kuhn published The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Supporters of Polanyi charged Kuhn with plagiarism, as it was known that Kuhn attended several of Polanyi's lectures, and that the two men had debated endlessly over epistemology before either had achieved fame. After the charge of plagiarism, Kuhn acknowledged Polanyi in the Second edition of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Despite this intellectual alliance, Polanyi's work was constantly interpreted by others within the framework of Kuhn's paradigm shifts, much to Polanyi's (and Kuhn's) dismay.Moleski, Martin X.

Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award In honor of his legacy, the \\"Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award\\" is awarded by the American Chemical Society to speakers who present original views that are at odds with mainstream scientific understanding. The winner is selected based on the novelty of the viewpoint and its potential impact if it were to be widely accepted. Honors Kuhn was named a Guggenheim Fellow in 1954, and in 1982 was awarded the George Sarton Medal by the History of Science Society. He also received numerous honorary doctorates.

Background  After gaining independence from France in 1956, the Moroccan government restricted Jewish emigration out of the country. In response, the Israeli government tasked Mossad with facilitating such emigration, using clandestine means. The Mossad initially organized illegal departures by boats, but that effort came to a halt in 1961 after the Egoz disaster, in which a ship carrying 44 immigrants capsized, drowning all passengers.  Operation Mural  A new approach was then implemented: Working with the Swiss-based NGO Œuvre de secours aux enfants – the Organization for the Rescue of Children – an offer was made to the Moroccan government to take Moroccan children on a vacation in Switzerland. Mossad agents then worked in the Jewish community to find families interested in emigration. Once there, the Jewish children would be flown to Israel instead of returning to Morocco. In 1961, David Littman volunteered for the mission. Littman thought he was working for the Jewish Agency – years later it was revealed it was arranged with the assistance of the Mossad. From March–July 1961, posing with his wife and baby daughter as Christians, Littman ran the Casablanca office of the Geneva-based international NGO for children Œuvre de Secours aux Enfants de l'Afrique du Nord (OSSEAN). His code name was \\"Mural\\", and the code name for the mission was \\"Operation Mural\\". After months of negotiation by Littman, the children left Morocco in five convoys under the guise of a supposed holiday in Switzerland (with Littman accompanying the last convoy), and from Switzerland went to Israel. In all, he assisted in evacuating 530 Jewish children to Israel. The children's families joined them several years later.[Mideast file, Volume 5, Issue 4, Mekhon Shiloaḥ le-ḥeḳer ha-Mizraḥ ha-tikhon ṿe-Afriḳah, Learned Information, 1986, accessed 14 January 2010] Meanwhile, Mossad agents Gad Shahar and Pinhas Katsir moved from house to house in Casablanca and persuaded the children's parents to allow their children to go to Israel without them with the risk that the Moroccan authorities might find out.(2009, February 23) Mossad : Shimon Peres reçoit David Littman...\\"Le-Mag votre hebdo online\\" http://www.juif.org/le-mag/100,mossad-shimon-peres-recoit-david- littman.php According to Shahar, \\"Throughout the entire length of the operation, he (Littman) himself did not know that he was working for the Mossad. He thought he was working for the Jewish Agency and that the masses of children and parents who were knocking at the door of his office in Casablanca had come to him in response to advertisements that had been published in the Moroccan press. In fact, hardly a single Jew had seen those notices. They were important only for the cover. The parents and children came to him as a result of our secret work, going from door to door and to reach the members of the community.\\" These were the last of Moroccan immigrants in this country before the gates were closed to Jewish emigration.Sheleg, Yair. (2007, December 17), Codename: Operation Mural. \\"Haaretz.\\" Retrieved from http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/codename-operation- mural-1.235412 25th anniversary of Operation Mural in 1986 was held in Ashkelon Conference of the children who came. The conference brought together the couple with grown-up children Littman and Littman, won an award for his work. After months of negotiation by Littman with the authorities – including holidays for Muslim groups in August – the Jewish children left Morocco in five convoys from 26 June to 24 July under the guise of a supposed holiday in Switzerland (with Littman accompanying the last convoy), and from Switzerland went to Israel. In all, Littman assisted in evacuating 530 Jewish children to Israel without the authorities realizing his goal. With the agreement of the Moroccan authorities he used special 'collective passports' and four months later this system was accepted by King Hassan II in an agreement for the exodus of 100,000 Jews from 1962-1964 in what became known as the Mossad's \\"Operation Yakhin\\". An article about Operation Mural by Shmuel Segev was published in the magazine Maariv in 1984. Littman's work was then recognized by President Chaim Herzog and later President Shimon Peres, who presented him with the Mimouna award in 1986. On 2004 Littman was awarded a Diploma of Recognition by Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz at 'Beit Lavron,' Ashdod, held on the Day of Remembrance for the Clandestine Network of North Africa. A documentary film on the operation, filmed by Yehuda Kaveh, screened in 2007, and has since been screened three times on Israel's Government Channel 1, on French Canadian TV and in a dozen film festivals. On June 1, 2008, Israeli President Shimon Peres honored Littman at a Presidential residence special commemorative event with his wife and family and former key Mossad agents in attendance, In his brief address, Peres said: > Well, it is a belated ceremony, but it doesn't lose its value, because what > you did stands on its own legs and is not affected by time.... [T]he saving > of 530 children is, I imagine, the most moving experience a man can have. > You say in Hebrew: 'The one who saves one life, is like the one that saved > the life of the whole world.' But when you save 530 children, it's really > unforgettable. I want to express, on behalf of our people, our nation, our > recognition of your courage, your wisdom, of your determination under > extremely difficult conditions. A year later the Israel Intelligence and Commemoration Center (MLM) honored Littman in a ceremony on 1 July 2009, when the \\"Hero of Silence\\" Order was conferred on him, he being the 9th person to receive it since 1985 (\\"An order of highest esteem and appreciation, awarded to David Gerald Littman: A clandestine warrior, who risked his life and who served a sacred cause of the People and of the State of Israel\\"). In March 2009, Le Soir Échos, a Casablanca newspaper, interviewed Littman and published the Operation Mural story. It was the first time that Moroccans learned about the affair.

The term is derived from the Turkish çavuş, meaning \\"courier\\" or \\"messenger\\", and was in use by the Byzantines perhaps as early as the late 11th century.. In the 13th–15th centuries, it became applied to officers serving in provincial posts. A tzaousios could serve as commander of the garrison of a kastron (a fortified administrative center run by a kephale), possibly combining the military and administrative roles, or as an officer to the megala allagia of the imperial field army. Most of the tzaousioi mentioned in the sources came from the Byzantine Morea, where they played an important role in provincial administration. In Macedonia and Thrace by contrast, they seem to have been limited to a purely military role within the megala allagia. The variant megas tzaousios (μέγας τζαούσιος, \\"grand tzaousios\\") is a court title first attested under John III Vatatzes (r. 1221–1254). His functions are unclear.. The French Byzantinist Rodolphe Guilland suggested that he was in command of subordinated tzaousioi, who acted as the successors of the earlier imperial courier corps, the mandatores.. In pseudo-Kodinos's mid-14th century Book of Offices, he is described as being responsible for maintaining the order of the imperial retinue.. Certainly, the first megas tzaousios, Constantine Margarites, was the commander of Vatazes's personal retinue,. but in later times, the title does not appear to have corresponded to a specific function..

He is a Professor of Psychology at the University of British Columbia. Schaller was born on November 27, 1962, in Palo Alto, California. His father is the well- known zoologist and animal conservationist George Schaller. During his childhood he lived in India, Pakistan, and Tanzania, as well as in the United States. He graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1984 and obtained a PhD in Psychology at Arizona State University in 1989, mentored by Robert Cialdini. Early in his academic career he held faculty positions at the University of Texas at Arlington and at the University of Montana. In 1996 he moved to his current position at the University of British Columbia. Research Much of Schaller's psychological research has examined the subtle cognitive processes that contribute to stereotypes and prejudices. One line of research focused on intuitive statistical reasoning processes. This work revealed that people form erroneous stereotypes when they engage in overly simplistic statistical reasoning, but that these erroneous stereotypes are less likely to emerge if people can be trained to engage in a more sophisticated reasoning process (analogous to a statistical analysis of covariance).Schaller, M., Asp, C. H., Rosell, M. C., & Heim, S. J. (1996). Training in statistical reasoning inhibits the formation of erroneous group stereotypes. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 22, 829-844. Another line of research focused on communication processes as they relate to the emergence and change of group stereotypes.Schaller, M., & Conway, L. G., III (1999). Influence of impression-management goals on the emerging contents of group stereotypes: Support for a social-evolutionary process. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 25, 819-833.Schaller, M., Conway, L. G., III, & Tanchuk, T. L. (2002). Selective pressures on the once and future contents of ethnic stereotypes: Effects of the communicability of traits. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 82, 861-877. Additional lines of research, informed by the adaptationist reasoning characteristic of evolutionary psychology, focused on the ways in which specific kinds of perceived threats (e.g., threat of interpersonal violence), and contextual cues connoting vulnerability to those threats (e.g., ambient darkness), trigger specific kinds of prejudices against specific categories of people.Schaller, M., Park, J. H., & Faulkner, J. (2003). Prehistoric dangers and contemporary prejudices. European Review of Social Psychology, 14, 105-137. Within his program of research on threats and prejudices, Schaller developed a broader line of research on the perceived threat of infectious disease and its implications for psychological functioning. In this context, he coined the term \\"behavioral immune system\\" to refer to a suite of evolved psychological mechanisms that serve as a crude first line of defense against infectious diseases. The behavioral immune system includes sensory mechanisms that allow people to detect the presence of pathogens in objects (including people) in their immediate environment, as well as stimulus-response mechanisms that trigger aversive affective, cognitive, and behavioral reactions to those things (and persons).Schaller, M.

Eudocia favoured her family, exercising her influence over her husband to advance Asclepiodotus' career.

Unlike his father and his sons Montgomery never appeared to have served in the British Army. Early years He was born in 1700 to Colonel Alexander Montgomery M.P. for County Monaghan, of Ballyleck, County Monaghan, and Elizabeth Cole, (married 1696), daughter of Colonel Thomas Cole of Mount Florence, Florencecourt, County Fermanagh. Political career He was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Lifford, County Donegal in 1729 until his death in April 1761, at the age of 61. Personal He married an Englishwoman, Mary Franklin (died April 1758), against his father's wishes and was disinherited by his father. Their children were: * American Revolutionary War hero and former British Army officer Major General Richard Montgomery * Colonel Alexander Montgomery, M.P. for County Donegal in 1768 and British Army officer * John Montgomery (1728–1787), a merchant in Lisbon, Portugal * Sarah Montgomery, who became Lady Ranelagh after marrying Charles Wilkinson Jones, the 4th Viscount Ranelagh. Up to 1729 his first cousin Colonel Alexander Montgomery shared the parliamentary patronage of Lifford, County Donegal with the Creighton family, the Earls of Erne. There is an agreement in the Erne papers (held in the Northern Ireland Public Records Office) dated 1727 between Alexander Montgomery and General David Creighton about the sharing of Lifford Corporation and its representation in the Irish House of Commons, to which it sent two MPs. One of the articles of agreement was that, if Montgomery should die without a son, then his interest should pass to the Creightons. Montgomery was elected as an MP for Donegal County in the General Election held later on in 1727, so General David Creighton and his son and heir, Abraham Creighton, (later the 1st Lord Erne) were returned as the two Lifford MPs. General David Creighton died in 1728 so the Lifford seat was filled by Thomas Montgomery, the nephew of Alexander. On the death of Thomas Montgomery in 1761, full control of the Lifford seats passed to Abraham Creighton.

He was born in Queens, New York on June 3, 1948. His father and brother both spent several years in Sing Sing, but he broke the family tradition and went to graduate school to study psychology. He studied social psychology under Robert B. Cialdini and received his Ph.D. from Arizona State University in 1976. He has edited several books on evolutionary psychology, contributed chapters to the Handbook of Social Psychology and the Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, and been an author of two multi-edition textbooks (Psychology, with John Seamon; and Social Psychology: Goals in Interaction, with Steven Neuberg and Robert B. Cialdini).Kenrick, D.T., Neuberg, S.L., & Cialdini, R.B. (2010). Social psychology: Goals in interaction. 5th edition. Boston: Allyn & Bacon He writes a blog for Psychology Today magazine, titled Sex, Murder, and the Meaning of Life, and has published a book of the same title. Research Douglas Kenrick has conducted research on topics including altruism, conformity, homicidal fantasies, human mate selection, personality, and racial stereotyping. Much of this research has examined sex differences in social behavior and cognition, and has tested hypotheses derived from evolutionary theory. The following are several illustrative examples: 1\\\\. In some of his early research, conducted with Sara Gutierres, Kenrick demonstrated that exposure to highly attractive people, like those shown in magazines, on television, and in movies, leads people judge average-looking peers as less attractive, and even to lower their commitment to their current partners. Men exposed to beautiful women, for example, rate themselves as less committed to their partners; women do likewise after being exposed to highly successful men.Gutierres, S.E., Kenrick, D.T., & Partch, J. (1999). Contrast effects in self assessment reflect gender differences in mate selection criteria. Personality & Social Psychology Bulletin, 25, 1126-1134.Kenrick, D.T., Neuberg, S.L., Zierk, K., & Krones, J. (1994). Evolution and social cognition: Contrast effects as a function of sex, dominance, and physical attractiveness. Personality & Social Psychology Bulletin, 20, 210-217. 2\\\\. Research he conducted with Richard C. Keefe overturned a long-standing assumption that women are attracted to older men, and vice versa, because of the norms of American society. This research demonstrated that the pattern of sex differences found in the United States is found all around the world, and is in fact more pronounced in more traditional societies. Further, young men, who are typically highly committed to sex-role norms, are more attracted to women older than themselves. The findings were explained in terms of sex differences in life history – women peak in fertility in their late teens and early twenties, and go through menopause later, men are attracted to cues associated with fertility, not to youth, per se. Men contribute resources to their offspring and can father children well past the age of female menopause. Women do not seek age, per se, but seek men with status and resources, which is correlated with age.Kenrick, D.T., & Keefe, R.C. (1992). Age preferences in mates reflect sex differences in mating strategies. (target article) Behavioral & Brain Sciences, 15, 75- 91 3\\\\. Early theorizing by evolutionary psychologists suggested that men were, compared with women, relatively nondiscriminating in mate choice. But research on mate choice sometimes found small sex differences, sometimes large differences. In research conducted with Edward K. Sadalla, Melanie R. Trost, and Gary Groth, Kenrick demonstrated that sex differences are small for long-term relationships, where both sexes make a high investment, but very large for short-term relationships, where the differences in minimum parental investment can be much greater.Kenrick, D.T., Sadalla, E.K., Groth, G., & Trost, M.R. (1990). Evolution, traits, and the stages of human courtship: Qualifying the parental investment model. Journal of Personality, 58, 97-116. 4\\\\. Research with Norman P. Li demonstrated that sex differences are more pronounced when men and women are given a realistic budget, and not asked simply to list their ideal desires in a mate. Forced to prioritize, women treat status as a necessity, and downplay physical attractiveness; men do the reverse.Li, N.P., & Kenrick, D.T. (2006). Sex similarities and differences in preferences for short-term mates: What, whether, and why. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 90, 468-489 5\\\\. Research conducted with Jon Maner, Steven Neuberg, Mark Schaller, and Vaughn Becker has focused on the implications of evolutionarily important motivational states on ongoing cognitive processes. This research has demonstrated that people in a self-protective frame of mind are sensitized to potential threats from outgroup males, interpreting neutral facial expressions on such men as hiding anger, for example. In a mating frame of mind, on the other hand, men project sexual arousal onto the beautiful women with neutral facial expressions. People are also especially quick and accurate at noticing anger on a man’s face, happiness on a woman’s face.Ackerman, J., Shapiro, J.R., Neuberg, S.L., Kenrick, D.T., Becker, D.V., Griskevicius, V., Maner, J.K., & Schaller, M., (2006).

IV Gruppe was formed 27 Oct 1940 as Erg.Sta./KG 30, and in April 1941 was increased to Gruppe strength. KG 30 was equipped with the Junkers Ju 88 and was initially trained as an anti-shipping and maritime attack unit: at the start of October 1939 it was attached to X. Fliegerkorps. On 16 October 1939 it attacked naval ships anchored off Rosyth Dockyard in the Firth of Forth]. II./KG 30 operated under X. Fliegerkorps for Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Norway. The unit Ju 88s engaged Allied shipping as its main target. On 9 April 1940, in cooperation with high-level bombing Heinkel He 111s of KG 26, Ju 88s of II./KG 30 dive-bombed and damaged the battleship and sank the destroyer . The unit lost four Ju 88s in the action, the highest single loss of KG 30 throughout the campaign. On 9 June 1940 Kampfgeschwader 30 took over Chièvres Air Base. On 17 June 1940 bombers from II./KG 30 sank RMS Lancastria off St Nazaire as she evacuated troops during Operation Ariel, killing some 5,800 Allied personnel. On 15 October 1940 III./KG 30 was redesignated Ergänzungskampfgruppe 6 and a new III./KG 30 was formed in Amsterdam-Schiphol from III./KG 4. In September 1942 was active against Arctic convoy PQ 18. Attacking PQ 18, the group carried out a massed torpedo attack known as the Golden Comb, developed as an anti-convoy measure. This was initially successful, sinking several ships, though the group suffered heavy losses.

GE's stake in the joint venture is 50 % plus 1 share. Formerly known as Alstom Wind, originally Alstom Ecotècnia, the company was the wind power company of energy infrastructure company Alstom, within its 'Power' operating division, from 2010 to 2015. The company originated as Ecotècnia S.c.c.l., a Spanish wind power equipment manufacturing and installation company established in 1981, acquired by Alstom 2007 for €350 million. The subsidiary's main product is the 6MW 'Haliade' offshore wind turbine, one of the most powerful turbines on Earth. History=Ecotècnia, 1987-2007 Detail of a wind turbine Alstom-Ecotècnica Eco80 in the Spanish Basque Country Ecotècnia was a manufacturer and installer of wind turbines established in 1981, headquartered in Barcelona, Spain. In 1999 it became part of the Basque- based cooperative Mondragon Corporation.Ecotècnia S.c.c.l, \\"Perfil Corporativo\\", 2003, company website The company's first wind generator was a 30 kW machine, developed by 1984 with funding assistance from the Spanish Science Ministry. In 1991 the company developed a 150 kW machine, and in 1992 won its first commercial project - for fifty 150 kW turbines at Tarifa, Spain. The particular demands of installing wind turbines in mountainous regions in Spain which included poor road access and blustery (high turbulence) conditions led to specific design features of Ecotècnia's turbines - including a modular construction of the turbine (three components: rotor and shaft; mainframe and yaw system; and the drive train - each less than 30t), as well as isolation of the gearbox from the main drive, reducing non-torque gearbox loads. In 2005 the company's estimate world market share (by installed capacity) was 2.1%. By 2007 the company had installed over wind farms with over 1GW total of rate power; the company had increased the power output of its wind turbine offering from 30 kW in 1984 to 1.67MW by 2003.Alstom and Ecotècnia, June 2008, \\"Evolución tecnológica\\", p.23 In the first half of the 1990s the company installed wind farms using its ECO20 150 kW model, from 1995 to 2000 the company's primary models were the ECO44 (640 kW) and ECO48 (750 kW) models. After 2003 most of the company's installations used its 1.67MW IEC-1400-1 class II ECO74, and class IIIA ECO80, three blade turbine models; both typically used a mechanically isolated Winergy AG PEAB 4390.2 planetary gearbox driving a doubly fed induction generator (typically ABB, Siemens, Winergy sourced) with IGBT inverter control, driven by individually pitch controlled LM manufactured blades. The majority of its installations were in Spain, with approximately 10% in other countries including Portugal, France, Italy as well as installations in Japan and India. In mid 2007 Alstom acquired Ecotècnia for 350 million euro.Sources:  By late 2007 the company employed over 800 people, with sales of approximately €400 million pa., and operated wind turbine assembly plants in Somozas and Buñuel, other sites at Rio del Pozo (control panels) and Coreses (tower manufacturing).Alstom and Ecotècnia, June 2008, \\"Current Footprint\\", pp.26-7 The company also manufactured small scale autonomous energy systems for isolated locations (tradename 'CICLOPS') comprising windgenerator (10 kW), photovoltaic solar source (2 to 10 kW), generator, battery and inverter, and was active in small scale photovoltaic cell installation (factory Pla de Santa Maria.).Ecotècnia S.c.c.l, \\"Activities\\", June 2007, company website Alstom Ecotècnia / Alstom Wind, 2007-2015 The first ECO100 3MW wind turbine was formally inaugurated at the Vieux Moulin wind farm (Pithiviers, Paris, France) 1 October 2009. The company was renamed Alstom Wind S.L. in April 2010. In 2010 Alstom began construction of a turbine nacelle factory in Amarillo, USA, completed in mid 2011. In November 2011 a 300MW per year capacity manufacturing plant in Camaçari near Salvador, Bahia, Brazil was formally opened.Sources: * * In March 2012 a prototype of Alstom Haliade 150 6MW offshore turbine was formally inaugurated; the turbine was developed for large scale offshore wind projects off the French coast;Sources: * * in January 2011 Alstom joined a consortium led by EDF Energies Nouvelles as turbine supplier (also including Dong Energy, Nass & Wind, WPD Offshore) to bid for proposed offshore wind farms in France of 6GW capacity.Sources: * * The Haliade 150 turbine was a development of the previous mechanically isolated transmission designs developed by Ecotècnia; the gearbox driven electrically generator was omitted and replaced with a gearless direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generator designed for higher efficiency and greater reliability with fewer moving parts. The turbine uses 73.5m turbine blades from LM Wind Power. In April 2012 the French state awarded an EDF/Dong Energy/Alstom consortium three contracts for offshore wind farms (Saint-Nazaire, Courseulles-sur-Mer, Fécamp.) off the northwestern coast of France of total power 1.4GW. As a result, Alstom confirmed that it would be constructing wind turbine factories at Cherbourg-en-Cotentin (Turbine blades in association with LM Power, wind turbine towers), and at Saint-Nazaire (Nacelles and generators) in the Montoir-de-Bretagne port area.Sources:  * * A 6MW 'Haliade' began generating electricity in July 2012 during certification testing. The turbines electrical generator is supplied by partner company, General Electric subsidiary GE Power Conversion (Converteam), who are also expected to establish a production plant in Saint Nazaire.Sources: * * In late 2012 Alstom announced the intention to construct a wind turbine tower manufacturing facility in Canoas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, on a site adjacent to an established Alstom power transmission factory. The plant was officially inaugurated in August 2013. In Feb. 2013 the company announced the cut of 35% of its workforce in Spain, due to a collapse in the Spanish wind market due to a change to governmental support for wind developments. The facilities at Somozas, Galicia (electrical equipment), and Zamora, Castille and Leon region (towers) were to close with electrical equipment production moved to the plant at Buñuel, Navarra. Total job losses were later reduced from 373 to 265. A Haliade 150 turbine was installed at the Belwind wind farm in November 2013 for operational tests, at the time being one of the largest operational wind turbines in the world. In December 2014 the St. Nazairre nacelle and generator assembly factory was officially opened. In early 2015 a wind turbine tower factory was opened in Jacobina, Bahia, Brazil; constructed as a joint venture (51%/49%) between Andrade Gutierrez and Alstom. Initial orders for the company's Haliade wind turbine included 5 units for the Block Island Wind Farm (USA, March 2015); and 66 units for DEME for the Merkur offshore wind farm (Germany, July 2015). In Nov 2015 most of Alstom's energy generation and transmission assets were acquired by General Electric, the combined business under GE was to be named GE Power. The two parties also created three joint ventures, among them a hydro and offshore renewable business unit. GE Power (offshore wind) (2016-) In February 2016 the first of a series production of 300 permanent magnet wind generators was completed at the St. Nazaire factory. A long planned test period for the 6MW Haliade is expected to start in Spring 2016 at Østerild Wind Turbine Test Field.

His major works include The Homes of Football and Scenes from a British Summer Country Pop Music Festival.  Life  Clarke was born in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, on 19 August 1961, the youngest of three children of Mary (née Punton-Smith) and Roy Percy Clarke, a quantity surveyor.  Career  After several years of working for local newspapers in Hertfordshire and as a freelance photographer for the magazine Time Out in London, Clarke went to live in The Lake District, where he began The Homes of Football in 1990. 262x262px The football opus, documenting the changing face of the game, was self-funded initially but then evolved into a touring exhibition hired by various municipalities and shown in 80 museums and art galleries over a 15-year period. In 1997 Clarke also opened a permanent gallery to his football work in the Lake District, at Ambleside, in the county of Cumbria. In 2005, he started Cumbria Surrounded, which went on to win the Lakeland Illustrated Book Of The Year in 2010.  Exhibitions =The Homes of Football Homes of Football Bristol exhibition 2004 The Homes of Football is composed of photographs taken entirely on medium format film, without cropping, using a Bronica camera and a standard lens. Clarke began The Homes of Football in the wake of the Hillsborough Disaster and the resulting Taylor Report. The earliest photograph in the collection is of four boys at Kilbowie Park, home of Clydebank, in 1989—a club and ground that has since disappeared. During the 1990s, Clarke made thousands of trips to football matches, photographing the crowd and the grounds themselves. The focus was on the ordinary football supporter, rather than the more 'glamorous' side of the game. Clarke was also the only official photographer for The Football Trust from 1991 and its successor The Football Foundation until 2005. The collection has been supported by the Professional Footballers' Association. =Exhibitions (UK unless specified)= * 1991: The Homes of Football, Burnley Towneley Hall Art Gallery, Barrow Forum 28 Gallery, Leeds City Museum * 1992: The Homes of Football, Stoke Museum & Art Gallery, Derby Metro Gallery, Birkenhead Williamson Museum & Art Gallery, Coventry Herbert Museum & Art Gallery, Bath F-Stop Gallery, Wigan History Shop Museum, Hove Museum & Art Gallery, Bournemouth Russell Cotes Museum & Art Gallery, Scunthorpe Museum & Art Gallery * 1993: The Homes of Football, Maidstone Library Gallery, Bilston Museum & Art Gallery, Aylesbury County Museum, Durham DLI Art Gallery, Fulham Library Gallery, Mansfield Museum & Art Gallery, Peterborough Museum & Art Gallery, Huddersfield Art Gallery, Westminster House of Commons (one day only), Hitchin Museum & Art Gallery, Middlesbrough Art Gallery, Southend Focal Point Gallery, Blackburn Museum & Art Gallery, Guernsey Museum & Art Gallery, Salford Museum & Art Gallery, Milton Keynes Exhibition Gallery * 1994: The Homes of Football, High Wycombe Guildhall, Grimsby Heritage Centre, Swansea Industrial Museum, Belfast Ulster Museum, Carlisle Tullie House Museum & Art Gallery * 1995: The Homes of Football, Bradford Industrial Museum, Warrington Museum & Art Gallery * 1996: The Homes of Football, Reading Museum & Art Gallery, Edinburgh City Arts Centre, Liverpool Museum of Liverpool Life, Coatbridge Summerlee Heritage Park * 1997: The Homes of Football, Arbroath Art Gallery, Forfar Methen Art Gallery, Paisley Museum & Art Gallery, Prescot Museum, Barnsley Cooper Gallery, Stockport Art Gallery * 1998: The Homes of Football, Bristol Museum & Art Gallery, Kilmarnock Dick Institute, Yorkshire York Museum, Wrexham Arts Centre, Falkirk Callendar House, Birmingham Mac * 1999: The Homes of Football, Holyhead Arts Centre, Dunfermline Pittencrief Museum, Kirkcaldy Museum & Art Gallery, Exeter Museum & Art Gallery, Cheltenham Museum, Dumfries Museum & Art Gallery, Stranraer Museum, Kirkcudbright Museum, Lincoln Usher Gallery, Luton Artezium, London RIBA * 2000: The Homes of Football, Gillingham Library, Strood Library, Solihull Arts Complex, Oldham Museum & Art Gallery, Darlington Art Gallery, Hull Ferens Art Gallery, Watford Museum, Wakefield Art Gallery * 2001: The Homes of Football, Leamington Spa Museum, Sheffield Galleries, Warrington Museum * 2002: The Homes of Football, Leicester Museum, South Shields Museum, Coventry Herbert Art Gallery, Leeds Corn Exchange, Bolton Museum & Art Gallery * 2003: The Homes of Football, Cardiff St.David's Hall, Sunderland Art Gallery, Salford Lowry Outlet, Reading Museum & Art Gallery, Shrewsbury Museum * 2004: The Homes of Football / Football in our Time, Gateshead Library, Lisbon University Portugal, Bristol Museum & Art Gallery, Norwich Forum * 2012: The Homes of Football, National Football Museum, Manchester * 2013: The Homes of Football / True Colours, National Football Museum, Manchester * 2014: The Homes of Football / Northern League 125, National Football Museum, Manchester * 2018 - 2019 The Game, National Football Museum, Manchester  Semi-permanent exhibitions  * 1997–2011: The Homes of Football at Ambleside: three-storey Museum * 2001–2007: Homes of Football: At The Football Association HQ London * 2014–current: The Homes of Football: In the Courtyard of FA Centre of Excellence, St George's Park National Football Centre =Critical response= John Motson called the work \\"A unique and wonderful collection of football scenes.

It is the most esteemed Bulgarian order and the second highest in the Kingdom of Bulgaria and fourth highest in the Republic of Bulgaria. It exists since 1880 with interruption between 1946 and 2003. The Royal Order The Order of Bravery was established with a decree of Knyaz Alexander Batenberg on 1 January 1880. It is the first Bulgarian order and was modeled after the Order of Military Merit of the Grand Duchy of Hesse which existed to 1866. The recipients of the order are called cavaliers. The order was one of the many violations of the Treaty of Berlin with which Bulgaria demonstrated full independence although the country was deprived of high state decorations - symbols of national independence. The head of state and the heir to the throne were cavaliers by right to Military Order of Bravery I grade and Military Order of Bravery IV grade respectively. Due to his great respect to the order Tsar Boris III never put on the Order of Bravery I grade and the Grand cross but only the Order of Bravery III grade, 2nd class received during the First Balkan War (1912-1913); the Order of Bravery III grade, 1st class received during the First World War (1915-1918) and the Order of Bravery IV grade, 1st class which he received by right as an heir in 1894.Списание „Нашата конница“, бр. 5,6, 1939 г., стр. 8 The order was first awarded on 17 April 1880 when 33 participants in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) received the order. Several days later on 24 April (6 May NS, the Day of St George), the order was awarded for the first time to a civilian person. Between 1937 and 1940, the sign of the Order of Bravery I grade, 1st class was used as a symbol of the Bulgarian Air Force in analogue with the Iron Cross which was the traditional symbol of the Luftwaffe. Several German officers received this award during World War II. After the end of the monarchy the orders and the medals of the Kingdom of Bulgaria were fully substituted with other ones. On 15 September the Order of Bravery ceased to exist. DescriptionOrder of Bravery= *Grand Cross of the Order of Bravery The Grand Cross was awarded only to the ruler who was a Grand Master of the order. It consisted of a necklace, a star and a mantle. There are five emissions. *Order of Bravery I grade, 1st class (until 1886 it was called Order of Bravery I grade) There are four emissions. *Order of Bravery I grade, 2nd class (since 1886) That order was awarded to Bulgarian and foreign generals and foreign rulers. Second, third and fourth grade were given to generals and officers according to their rank. *Order of Bravery II grade There are two emissions. *Order of Bravery III grade, 1st class (until 1915 it was called Order of Bravery III grade) There are three emissions. *Order of Bravery III grade, 2nd class (since 1915) There are five emissions. *Order of Bravery IV grade, 1st class (until 1915 it was called Order of Bravery IV grade) There are seven emissions. *Order of Bravery IV grade, 2nd class (since 1915) There are ten emissions. =Soldier Cross of Bravery= The Soldier Cross of Bravery was a medal enlisted to the Order of Bravery. *Soldier Cross of Bravery I grade Gold-plated, with crossed ribbons *Soldier Cross of Bravery II grade Gold-plated, without crossed ribbons *Soldier Cross of Bravery III grade Silver-plated, with crossed ribbons *Soldier Cross of Bravery IV grade Silver-plated, without crossed ribbons Knights of the Order of Bravery I grade In the Bulgarians history there are only three persons awarded with the Order of Bravery I grade: *Stefan Stambolov - Bulgarian statesman, revolutionary, politician, poet and journalist. *Georgi Zhivkov - Bulgarian revolutionary and politician of the People's Liberal Party, three times chairman of the National Assembly, regent of Bulgaria after the abdication of Alexander I (1886-1887) and minister of enlightenment (1886, 1887-1893). *Major General Sava Mutkurov - regent of Bulgaria (1886–1887) and minister of defense in the government of Stefan Stambolov (1887–1893). Monarchs: *Knyaz Alexander Batenberg *Tsar Ferdinand *Tsar Boris III *Emperor Alexander III of Russia *King Milan I of Serbia *King Carol I of Romania The order was also awarded to: *The Samara flag *3rd Opalchenska company The Republic Order The order was reestablished after interruption of 57 years with a law by the 39th National Assembly of 29 May 2003 and published in State Gazette on 21 May 2004.

The island is inhabited mostly by the swimsuit-clad girls from the Dead or Alive series. The game has several gameplay aspects, featured most prominently is the beach volleyball minigame similar to Dead or Alive Xtreme 2. The other minigames include pool games like swimming pool hopping and butt battles as well as casino games like poker, blackjack and slots. The second aspect of the game consists of interacting with the girls by mingling with them, giving them presents such as new swimwear. The third aspect is to purchase a camera from the Island Shop and take photographs of the girls which can then be assembled into an album. Once the relationship with the girls is on an intimate level, the girls would then present the player with \\"venus clips\\" which can be viewed and edited by the player. A code was also discovered in the game dubbed \\"Emperor's New Clothes\\", which allowed the player to have the girls nude, although certain inappropriate parts are not shown. Characters The game features mostly playable characters from the Dead or Alive series: Ayane, Christie, Helena, Hitomi, Kasumi, Kokoro, Leifang, Lisa, and Tina. The additional girl, Rio, is a guest character who appears from a series of pachislot titles by Tecmo, adapted from the Rakushou! Pachi-Slot Sengen series of video games and an anime series Rio: Rainbow Gate!, released after this game. Development and release Dead or Alive Paradise promo booth at Tokyo Game Show 2006 The previous team leader of Team Ninja, Tomonobu Itagaki had previously expressed interest in bringing the Dead or Alive Xtreme series to handhelds such as the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable in 2004. The game was first revealed in Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu in December 2009. A North American release was announced a month later in January 2010. Paradise is the first game in the series not to be developed by Team Ninja. Regarding Dead or Alive Xtreme 3, when questioned about it, Team Ninja's Yosuke Hayashi implied that he would consider making Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 if people stated their support for it on Team Ninja's official Twitter account. On March 11, 2010, a DRM-free demo version was released on the Japanese PlayStation Store, and then distributed by Japanese website 4Gamer and other web sites. The demo features a sample of the game's Gravure Mode, where the player chooses a character, a swimsuit and a situation to take photos. In the demo, Hitomi is the only available character, with two bikinis and three situations. Unlike in the full version, the pictures cannot be saved in the demo. The demo can currently be downloaded on PSP demo specialized web sites, as well as in the game's official Japanese website. The game was released in all regions during March and April 2010. In Japan, Dead or Alive Paradise had on its release, other than the stand-alone game, two different bundles: one costing ¥7,329 and the other costing ¥15,729. The first comes with a secret photo album, a soundtrack CD, an original Kasumi box cover and the game. The second one is bundled with all that plus a Kasumi figurine, which wears two different swimsuits. Reception Dead or Alive Paradise has received generally negative to mediocre reviews, resulting in a Metacritic score of only 38/100. Scott Jones and Victor Lucas from Reviews on the Run both gave the game a 0.0/10 rating saying the best word to describe the game is \\"pathetic\\". On the other hand, GamesRadar gave it a relatively high score of 7/10 saying on its verdict that it is \\"overall fun and deceptively deep.\\" Controversy The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) classification has described Dead or Alive Paradise as filled with \\"creepy voyeurism\\" and \\"bizarre, misguided notions of what women really want.\\" The original text was rewritten later and ESRB apologized saying the first post was posted \\"in error\\", considering it \\"improperly\\" and filled with \\"subjective language.\\" Producer Yoshinori Ueda said that the game is not supposed to be softcore pornography, neither degrading towards women. However, art director Yasushi Nakamura also implied that if fans did masturbate to the series, Team Ninja \\"could consider that a success\\". He also said that Paradise was an effort to restart making the Dead or Alive series, as well as to broaden its appeal.

If we take a pseudo- Riemannian manifold (M,g) then the metric g is a parallel and therefore recurrent tensor with respect to its Levi-Civita connection, which is defined via : abla^{LC} g = 0 and its property to be torsion-free. Parallel vector fields ( abla X = 0) are examples of recurrent tensors that find importance in mathematical research. For example, if X is a recurrent non-null vector field on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold satisfying : abla X = \\\\omega\\\\otimes X for some closed one-form \\\\omega , then X can be rescaled to a parallel vector field.Alekseevsky, Baum (2008) In particular, non-parallel recurrent vector fields are null vector fields. Metric space Another example appears in connection with Weyl structures. Historically, Weyl structures emerged from the considerations of Hermann Weyl with regards to properties of parallel transport of vectors and their length.Weyl (1918) By demanding that a manifold have an affine parallel transport in such a way that the manifold is locally an affine space, it was shown that the induced connection had a vanishing torsion tensor :T^ abla(X,Y) = abla_XY- abla_YX - [X,Y] = 0. Additionally, he claimed that the manifold must have a particular parallel transport in which the ratio of two transported vectors is fixed. The corresponding connection abla' which induces such a parallel transport satisfies : abla' g = \\\\varphi \\\\otimes g for some one-form \\\\varphi. Such a metric is a recurrent tensor with respect to abla'. As a result, Weyl called the resulting manifold (M,g) with affine connection abla and recurrent metric g a metric space. In this sense, Weyl was not just referring to one metric but to the conformal structure defined by g . Under the conformal transformation g \\\\rightarrow e^{\\\\lambda}g, the form \\\\varphi transforms as \\\\varphi \\\\rightarrow \\\\varphi -d\\\\lambda. This induces a canonical map F:[g] \\\\rightarrow \\\\Lambda^1(M) on (M, [g]) defined by :F(e^\\\\lambda g) := \\\\varphi - d\\\\lambda, where [g] is the conformal structure. F is called a Weyl structure,Folland (1970) which more generally is defined as a map with property :F(e^\\\\lambda g) = F(g) - d\\\\lambda. Recurrent spacetime One more example of a recurrent tensor is the curvature tensor \\\\mathcal{R} on a recurrent spacetime,Walker (1948) for which : abla \\\\mathcal{R} = \\\\omega \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal{R}.

Currently, they are all business loops, although a spur route in Pine Bluff, Arkansas and bypass routes in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Springfield, Missouri both existed in the past. Pine Bluff business loopConway business route US 65B passes through the campus of Hendrix College during its Conway routing. U.S. Highway 65 Business (US 65B) is a business route of U.S. Route 65 in Faulkner County, Arkansas. The route's northern terminus is at Interstate 40/US 65 in north Conway. It runs south through Conway beginning as Skyline Drive to intersect Old Morrilton Highway (US 64). These two routes overlap and run south as Harkrider Street. Continuing south US 64/US 65B approach a roundabout entrance to Hendrix College and continue to pass by Galloway Hall and several other campus buildings. Exiting the south part of campus at another roundabout intersection with Siebenmorgan Road (AR 266), the two routes continues south for several blocks before US 64 breaks east to end the concurrency. US 65B continues south near Dennis F. Cantrell Field and Oak Grove Cemetery before an intersection with Arkansas Highway 60 and Arkansas Highway 365 in south Conway. The route turns east and runs until an intersection with I-40/US 65 and Arkansas Highway 286 continuing east. ;Major intersections Clinton business route U.S. Highway 65 Business (US 65B) is a business route of U.S. Route 65 in Van Buren County, Arkansas. The route's northern terminus is at US 65/AR 9 in north Clinton. It runs south through Clinton, past the Clinton Cemetery. Continuing south, US 65B passes the Joclin-Bradley-Bowling House and the Patterson, Walter, Filling Station, which are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. US 65B also passes within a block of the Van Buren County Courthouse, south of which the route terminates at US 65/AR 9. ;Major intersections Western Grove business route U.S. Highway 65 Business (US 65B) is a business route of U.S. Route 65 in Newton County, Arkansas. The route's northern terminus is at US 65 in north Western Grove. It runs south through downtown Western Grove, passing the post office and Western Grove High School. South of the high school, US 65B runs south to terminate at US 65 and Arkansas Highway 123. ;History This roadway was originally part of U.S. Route 65 until 1967, when a bypass was built around Western Grove. The main route was rerouted onto the bypass, with the downtown alignment becoming US 65 Business. ;Route description Harrison business route US 65B in Harrison U.S. Highway 65 Business (US 65B or Main Street in Harrison) is a business route of U.S. Route 65 in Boone County, Arkansas. The route's northern terminus is at US 62/US 65/US 412 in north Harrison. In its role as Main Street, US 65B serves many historic buildings along its route through the historic center of Harrison. The route passes Hotel Seville and the Harrison Courthouse Square Historic District, the center of which is the Boone County Courthouse. Just west of Main Street's intersection with Central Avenue is the Boone County Jail, where Henry Starr died of wounds inflicted by a rifle while attempting to rob a Harrison bank. South of Crooked Creek, the route winds east to serve the fairgrounds and North Arkansas College before terminating at US 62/US 65/US 412. ;History The route was designated in the 1960s. It was repaved entirely in 1975. ;Major intersections Branson-area business loop U.S Route 65 Business in the Branson area southern terminus begins in Point Lookout, Missouri at a Single-point urban interchange, which serves Point Lookout, College of the Ozarks, and Hollister, Missouri. Business 65 tracks west approximately 1,000 feet to an intersection with County Road 165 (south to the Table Rock Dam) and Opportunity Avenue (west to College of the Ozarks). Business 65 then turns right heading north, then on an overpass over US 65, toward Hollister. Next to the overpass lies the original southern terminus; removed when US 65 was upgraded to a 4-lane Expressway south of Lake Taneycomo. Business 65 then descends into the Turkey Creek Valley through historic downtown Hollister; crossing Turkey Creek north of downtown. Shortly after the Turkey Creek bridge, Business 65 is the western terminus of Missouri BB, which runs east toward the Hollister High School. Business 65 continues North to a Roundabout in the southeast bank of Lake Taneycomo, where it intersects with Missouri 76 (east to Forsyth, Missouri) and Branson Landing Boulevard; continuing with Missouri 76 west over the Lake Taneycomo Bridge, entering historic downtown Branson, Missouri. Signage in Branson then takes Business 65, concurrent with Missouri 76, through downtown, then heads west by turning left at Main Street. Business 65/Missouri 76 then ascends what is locally known as \\"Hamburger Hill\\" (due to all of the Hamburger restaurants on either side of the roadway) to an interchange at US 65. Business 65 eastern terminus, thus, is at US 65, while Missouri 76 turns north, concurrently, with US 65. Continuing straight ahead will take you to 76 Country Boulevard, locally known as \\"The 76 Strip\\" or simply \\"The Strip.\\" Business 65 originally continued straight onto Veterans Boulevard, instead of turning onto Main Street. It then continued until Veterans Boulevard until ending at US 65/Missouri 248/Shepherd of the Hills Expressway interchange. Business 65 was moved to its current alignment with the completion of the Branson Landing development in 2008. Some online maps still sign this alignment as Business 65. Also, a Business 65 bannered shield is attached to the side of the Roark Creek bridge just north of downtown; however, the sign cannot be seen from the roadway itself. Ozark business loop U.S. Route 65 Business southern terminus in Ozark, is at an interchange on the south side of town with US 65 and Missouri Route F. Business 65 runs east, past a Walmart Supercenter, among other stores, for about 1.4 miles. At the intersection of Business 65 and Missouri State Highway 14 (east to Sparta), both highways turn north concurrently toward downtown Ozark on what is also known as 3rd street. The route continues for 1.5 miles, mostly descending into the Finley River valley. Business 65/Route 14 then turn West onto Jackson Street, promptly crossing over the Finley River Bridge. The highways continue west for about 1 mile to an interchange at US 65; along the way, Business 65/Route 14 is the southern terminus for Missouri Route NN/9th street, which runs north to the Ozark High School. At US 65, Business 65 ends, while Route 14 continues west toward Nixa and US 160/Route 13. Springfield business loop U.S. Route 65 Business in Springfield parallels US 65, which follows the Schoolcraft Freeway along the east edge of town, for its entire length. Route 65 Business begins at an interchange with US 60, the James River Freeway. For most of its length, the route follows Glenstone Avenue, a major retail corridor in Springfield. Glenstone Avenue is an expressway from US 60 to Battlefield Road. At the corner of Battlefield and Glenstone lies Battlefield Mall, the region's largest shopping mall. Business 65 continues north as a four-lane arterial road. At Sunshine Street, it serves as the western terminus of Route D. Route 65 Business continues along Glenstone until the intersection with Chestnut Expressway, where it meets I-44 Business. Eastbound I-44 BUS turns north from Chestnut onto Glenstone at this intersection, while Business 65 turns east onto Chestnut. Thus, the two routes do not truly intersect; all motorists must make a turn to continue on the numbered route that they were previously on. Business 65 then proceeds eastward along Chestnut Expressway until it intersects with mainline US-65, where the business route terminates. Originally, Business 65 continued north on Glenstone to Interstate 44; the routing was shifted when Chestnut Expressway east of Glenstone was turned over to MoDOT by the city in exchange for Division Street (previously Missouri YY between US 65 and Glenstone). Marshall business loopCarrollton business loopTrenton business loop U.S. Highway 65 Business starts at the junctions of Missouri Route 6 and US 65 and runs west a few hundred yards before turning north onto Oklahoma Avenue. It follows Oklahoma Avenue north to the junction of Oklahoma Avenue and 28th Street where it turns east and terminates at US 65. Former routes=Baton Rouge bypass route U.S. Highway 65 Bypass (US 65 Byp.) ran around Baton Rouge, the capital city of Louisiana. It entirely duplicated the path of US 61 Byp. and existed during the period that US 65 was co-signed with US 61 between New Orleans, Louisiana and Natchez, Mississippi. The route followed the Airline Highway around what was then the outside of town, allowing through traffic from the south and east to access the Mississippi River Bridge while avoiding the downtown area. The bypass is now part of mainline US 61 and US 190\\\\.

A climograph is a graphical representation of a location's basic climate. Climographs display data for two variables: (a) monthly average temperature and (b) monthly average precipitation. These are useful tools to quickly describe a location's climate. Representation One form of representation uses an overlapped combination of a bar and line chart used to show the climate of a place over a 12-month period. The horizontal axis (x-axis) displays the 12 months while the vertical axis contains the precipitation scale on one side and the temperature scale on the other. While temperature is typically visualized using a line, some climographs opt to visualize the data using a bar. This method's advantage allows the climograph to display the average range in temperature (average minimum and average maximum temperatures) rather than a simple monthly average. Use The patterns in a climograph describe not just a location's climate but also provide evidence for that climate's relative location. For example, a climograph with a narrow range in temperature over the year might represent a location close to the equator, or alternatively a location adjacent to a large body of water exerting a moderating effect on the temperature range. Meanwhile, a wide range in annual temperature might suggest the opposite. We could also derive information about a site's ecological conditions through a climograph. For example, if precipitation is consistently low year-round, we might suggest the location reflects a desert; if there is a noticeable seasonal pattern to the precipitation, we might suggest the location experiences a monsoon season. When combining the temperature and precipitation patterns together, we have even better clues as to the local conditions. Despite this, it is important to note that a number of local factors contribute to the patterns observed in a particular place; therefore, a climograph is not a foolproof tool that captures all the geographic variation that might exist.

The software was designed to replace standard physical music editing techniques in industries using commercial music catalogs, including soundtrack temping, radio and television advertising, film/video sound scoring, and theme production. Manual editing labor was reduced from a typical time involvement of several minutes per edit by a skilled editor performing a multiplicity of edits per selection, to just a few seconds for an unskilled user to perform all edits required to re-length or re-order the music selection. The program consisted of several modules including an automatic editor interface (TuneBuilder), a control file production module (AutoBlade), a search utility (TuneFinder), and audio file format exchanges (S/Link). TuneBuilder's technology was invented by Darryl Goede with a U.S. patent granted in 1998. The TuneBuilder patent was further cited in twenty-three subsequent patents. The patent describes the technology as the creation and storage of a mapping/descriptive file that located sections of music stored as digital files. Then in a subsequent process, the mapping file then directed a processor to produce an audio output stream consisting of a new sequence of the sections. There were 18,000 commercial music selections mapped to work under TuneBuilder, drawn from libraries including Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG), Killer Tracks, and KPM Musichouse. As an editing software, TuneBuilder was commercialized and marketed from 1996 to 1999 by AirWorks Media Incorporated, a Canadian company. Editing systems were initially developed for DOS, Mac, and Amiga. A Windows 95 version was released in mid-1996 that incorporated software purchased by AirWorks in late 1995 from SOC Associates who had acquired the software in the breakup of New England Digital, developers of the Synclavier.

Ancient Chinese Five Poisons  A Chinese Five Poisons charm with the inscription \\"Expel evil and send down good fortune\\" (驱邪降福) with a spider and the three- legged toad, Jin Chan, on display at the Museum of Ethnography, Sweden. The fifth day of the fifth month or Duanwu in ancient Chinese folklore symbolised the beginning of the Summer, this day also known as \\"Double 5 day\\" or \\"Double 5th day\\" or more commonly tiān zhōng jié () was seen as one of the most inauspicious and dangerous days of the year. This was because all the poisonous animals and bugs would then began to appear. \\"Double five\\" day was furthermore seen as the hottest day and it was believed that the heat would cause illness. The Ancient Chinese believed that the only way to combat poison was with poison, and one way they believed that they could protect themselves on this day was by drinking realgar wine which contains arsenic sulfide, another way to protect themselves on this day was by hanging pictures of Zhong Kui, another custom holds that the Chinese should mix mercury (cinnabar) with wine, or using Gu poison to combat these creatures, however by far the most common way of protecting themselves was using \\"Five poison\\" charms and amulets (), it was also customary for Chinese parents to let their children wear these amulets that have pictures of the 5 poisons or otherwise hang small pouches filled with mugwort around the necks of these children. The five poisons in this context don't refer to five actual toxins but to five animals that were perceived to be \\"poisonous\\", these animals according to various historical sources usually included: * Snakes * Scorpions * Centipedes * Toads * Spiders But in some variants toads were replaced by Jin Chan, and in other variants tigers are members of the 5 poisons. Tigers are then considered members of the five poisons because they are solitary animals and the Mandarin Chinese word for \\"solitary\\" has a similar pronunciation as the word for \\"poison\\".

Forming out of a monsoonal trough on 22 February, Kate rapidly intensified throughout the day. By 23 February, the system attained its peak intensity with winds of 95 km/h (60 mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 985 hPa (mbar). Shortly thereafter, increasing wind shear caused the storm to quickly weaken. By 24 February, the system dissipated over open waters near Queensland, Australia. Although Kate did not directly affect land, large swells produced by the storm impacted beaches in Papua New Guinea and Queensland. The waves injured six people in Australia, although no property damage was reported. Meteorological history Cyclone Kate originated from an area of low pressure that was first identified on 22 February 2006, within a monsoonal trough. The system rapidly intensified throughout the day, with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology issuing their first advisory on the system that evening. Upon being classified, the system was immediately declared Tropical Cyclone Kate, skipping tropical low status. At the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began issuing advisories on the system, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 13P. The storm had developed well-defined, upper-level outflow enhanced by diffluence over the system. The system remained nearly stationary over the northwestern Coral Sea. Early on 23 February, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 95 km/h (60 mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 985 hPa (mbar). However, the JTWC assessed the system to have been slightly weaker, attaining peak winds of 85 km/h (50 mph 1-minute sustained). Further intensification was anticipated as Kate slowly tracked towards Queensland, Australia. However, Kate stalled shortly thereafter and began to weaken due to increasing wind shear. Rapid weakening took place throughout the day, and JTWC declared the system dissipated early on 24 February. The Bureau of Meteorology downgraded Kate to a tropical low around the same time, although they continued to monitor the storm for several more hours before reporting that it had dissipated over open waters. Preparations and impact Upon the cyclone's formation, the Bureau of Meteorology warned vessels to avoid the storm in anticipation of rough seas and winds gusting to . Although the storm did not pose much of a threat to Queensland, officials urged residents to ensure their disaster kits were ready and that preparations for a moderate storm, such as storing lose outdoor objects and clearing gutters, had been completed. While the storm had no direct impact on land, large swells affected most of the Queensland coastline. In the Shire of Noosa, six surfers sustained serious injuries after wading into turbulent waters. Waves up to tossed the six surfers, leaving them with injuries ranging from broken noses and fractured ankles to head wounds from surfboards. The waves also caused additional beach erosion to parts of Papua New Guinea previously impacted by Cyclone Ingrid in March 2005.

The process surrounding the 2008 appointments was criticised by professor of comparative politics at the University of Bergen, Gunnar Grendstad for a \\"lack of transparency\\". Journalist Hanne Skartveit (working for Verdens Gang) tried to push the three newly appointed judges to reveal their political positions in a selection of matters of public interest.Skartveit, Hanne (13 October 2008).

The majority of the three justices passed judgment in favour of the government, while the dissenting justices (counting two) argued that the government ought to be seen as responsible for the company's loss of income.

A meal would usually have a vegetable stew called ensaang or athongba, flavored with dried or fried fish; stir-fried vegetables called kanghou; and a spicy item, which could be morok metpa (a chilli paste), iromba (boiled and mashed vegetables with chilli and fermented fish), or singju (a piquant salad). All piquant side dishes are accompanied by a choice of fresh herbs, collectively called maroi. The base and essence of Meitei cuisine is the fermented fish called ngari. Several dishes of meat include Yen thongba,Nganu thongba,oak thongba, ꯌꯦꯟ ꯊꯣꯡꯕ(chicken) San thongba, etc cooked with unique recipes A side of steamed (a-ngaanba) or boiled vegetables with a hint of sugar (cham-phut) are also quite common as palate cleansers in most meals. The aromatics of most dishes start with frying bay leaf, chives, onion, garlic, and ginger in mustard oil. The rest of the vegetables follow after that. Oil is sparingly used in most of the main stews but the sides of kanghou (stir-fried spicy vegetables) and bora (fritters) make up for that. Fish is also a staple, and appears in every meal, either as ngaari or as roasted or fried pieces. While fish is an essential part of the diet, due to increasing prices, fish curry is prepared only occasionally, or during feasts. The Meiteis live in the valley of Manipur where freshwater fish from lakes and rivers and ponds had been plentiful until recent times. While part of the cuisine has some influences from the cuisines of Southeast Asia, East Asia, Central Asia, Siberia, Micronesia, Polynesia as well as from Assam and West Bengal, the essence remains distinct from any other.  Basic diet  The staple diet of Manipur consists of rice, fish, large varieties of leafy vegetables (of both aquatic and terrestrial). Manipuris typically raise vegetables in a kitchen garden and rear fishes in small ponds around their house. Since the vegetables are either grown at home or obtained from local market, the cuisines are very seasonal, each season having its own special vegetables and preparations. The taste is very different from other Indian cuisines because of the use of various aromatic herbs and roots that are peculiar to the region and list of these aromatic herbs and roots are listed below.  Aromatic herbs and roots used by the Manipuris  # Nungshi hidak (Mint) # Maroi napaakpi (Hooker chives) # Yenam(maroi nakuppi) (Chinese chives) # Awaa phadigom (Mexican coriander) # Mayang-ton (Lemon Basil) # Toning-khok (Chameleon plant) # Khanghuman / Kanghu-maan (Meriandra dianthera, formerly Meriandra bengalensis) # Mukthrubi (Zanthoxylum armatum / Sichuan peppercorn) # Phakpai (Vietnamese coriander) # Chantruk (pepper cress) # Yaipan (Curcuma angustifolia) # Kang-hu mapaan # Takhel-manao # Nongmangkha- mapan # Leipung-khang (Solanum anguivi) Further, many large varieties of the vegetables that are used in daily meals are found only in and around the region and not seen elsewhere. Some of these are as follows: # Yendem (a kind of Indian taro) # Hangam Pere (mustard big leaf) # Kobi (Cabbage) # Hangam angouba (lettuce) # Chawai # Hawai manaa # Koukhaa (Arrowhead or Katniss) # Kakthrum # Loklei # kengoi # Punlei # Kolamni (Water spinach) # Peruk (Centella) # Yelaang (Jointweed) # Kengoi # Phunin # Yensil (Creeping woodsorrel) # Thaanjing (Foxnut) # Yongchaak (Parkia javanica/Stink bean or Bitter bean) # Yaipan (East Indian Arrowroot) # khang-mana # Komprek (Japanese parsley) # Hei-ba mana # Yendung # Chengkhruk # Tengnou-Maanbi (winged bean) # Ookhajing # Ikaithabi # Sougri (Roselle Leaves) Various kind of mushrooms also form an important part of the cuisines. These include: # Thangjiyen # leibakmaroom # Uyen (similar to shiitake mushroom) # Uchi-na (Jelly ear) # Chengum (Mushroom) # charu-yen # Kanglayen (Split gill mushroom), # Ushoi (Bamboo Shoots), etc. There are also ingredients in the cuisine that require an acquired taste, such as Hawaijaar (fermented soya bean, somewhat similar to the Japanese Natto), Soibum (fermented bamboo shoot) and Ngaa-ri (fermented fish).  Simple dishes  Chahao kheer, a popular dessert of Manipur Eromba is a chutney that have vegetables boiled or steamed with a lot of red chillies or umorok (king chilli) with ngari (fermented fish), smoked or roasted fish and mashed together. \\"U-morok\\" – literally ‘tree chilli’ u = tree; morok = chilli. It is garnished with herbs like maroi ( maroi nakuppi, phakpai, mayang-ton, toning-khok, kaanghumaan, lomba, tilhou, chaantruk, coriander leaves and many more). Singju is a piquant salad which is prepared with an assortment of raw vegetables, and can have varying combinations depending on preference or season. The vegetables are chopped into very thin juliennes, while the accompanying herbs and leaves are coarsely chopped or shredded. Some of the usual main ingredients are cabbage, lotus stem, laphu tharo (banana flower), komprek (a kind of scented herb), kollamni (another herb), yongchaak (tree beans/stink beans/ Parkia speciosa). The accompanying herbs and leaves include sweet pea shoots,\\"toningkhok\\" (Houtuniya cordata) leaves and roots, \\"heibi mana\\", coriander leaves etc. Most singju items are seasonal, making every season's singju a much loved treat. Singju can be seasoned with a chilli paste flavored with roasted ngari (fermented fish), or with roasted \\"thoiding\\" seeds (Perilla frutescens) powder and roasted chick pea powder/roasted besan, plus roasted red chilli powder. Thoiding seeds are rich in healthy fats and vitamins, and when they are roasted they give a nutty flavor that is distinctive to a Singju. Other additional ingredients include boiled beans and peas, and also savory crispies, though these are optional. Chamthong or Kangshoi is a stew of any seasonal vegetables with coarsely chopped onions or spring onion, maroi - both yennam nakuppi and napakpi, ginger, ngari and salt, topped with ngari, dried fish, or fried fish pieces and water. It is soupy in consistency and is eaten with rice. Morok metpa is a coarse paste prepared with green or dry red chilies mixed with chopped onions, coriander leaves and other local herbs for garnishing. The chilies are steamed or roasted with ngari or simply crushed and then mashed with salt and ngari; fried fish pieces can also be added to it. This is something which accompanies both the meals as a routine side dish. Other dishes include kang-ngou or kaang-hou (various vegetables stir fried with traditional spices), nganam (prepared with fish and maroi on a pan) or paaknam (sort of a pancake prepared with a mixture of pea flour, maroi napaakpi, laphu tharo, awa phadigom, and ngari wrapped in turmeric and banana leaves and baked in a pan or steam it first and then roasted it for sometime), nga-thongba (fish curry), ooti (a typical Manipuri vegetarian dish), pakoura thongba, chagem pomba (made with fermented soya, mustard leaves, roasted or smoked fish and other herbs), keli chana, alu kangmet (boiled potato mashed with fried red chilli and nakuppi with salt and/or dressed with mustard oil), sana thongba which is prepared with paneer in Manipuri style, a-nganba (steamed vegetables, such as pumpkin, peas, carrots, French beans, etc.).

Where a High Voltage electrical boundary occurs, for instance between a power station and electrical utility, the safety controllers each side of the boundary must co-ordinate their activities. For the electrical transmission system in England, Wales and Scotland, the Ofgem-defined industry standard document OC8 of the Grid code defines how safety precautions can be managed with the Record of Inter System Safety Precautions (RISSP) independently from the safety rules of the connected parties. The purpose of the RISSP is to guarantee that safety precautions provided by a third-party can be quoted in a safety document so that work can take place. Identifying number The RISSP form must have a uniquely identifying number, provided by the party requesting safety precautions. To achieve this, all parties connected to the national grid must have a RISSP prefix code. These are, in general, abbreviations of the company name at the time it applied for its code. All RISSPs have the suffix 'R'. The requester states the location and equipment that requires the RISSP. The implementer then states the location and nature of the precautions provided for adequate safety that equipment. Cascading RISSP Some interfaces may include more than two parties, for instance on substation busbars (BB). This may require one request via a party on the BB to go via the BB controller to the other parties. It is then for the BB controller to get all required safety from other parties to cascade on to the initial requesting controller. This is sometimes referred to as a cascading RISSP. Where a third-party making a request for safety precautions controls some of the other infeeds to an interface on which safety has been requested (such as a distribution network operator who has more than one circuit on a BB, but is requesting safety for just one of those circuits) it is up to the requester themselves to control the linked safety precautions to ensure that safety from the interface. This is often referred to as linkage. It is possible to have both linkage and cascading in a single job, requiring use of RISSP forms with multiple users. Multiple directions In addition it is possible for to request safety in multiple directions, which results in controllers having both requesting and implementing RISSPs in force simultaneously. These RISSPs may be cascading and/or linkage. It is not possible to have RISSPs going in multiple directions if HV testing is taking place across a boundary. In these circumstances only a single safety document can be in force at any one time and any RISSPs in place can only be to ensure the safety precautions for this document. Control boundaries RISSPs do not have to be from one company to another, only one control boundary to another. Thus two distribution network operators owned by the same parent company but with different geographical areas of responsibility use RISSPs with each other. Also, the boundary between a High Voltage controller and a Low Voltage controller can be controlled by the RISSP process. This most commonly occurs with the fuses/links between an auxiliary transformer and a substation's 415 volt AC supplies. Authorisation RISSPs can only be agreed to and signed by a suitably authorised person. Any company that is connected to the grid must have somebody authorised available or on call at all times.

He was secretary-general of the Supreme Court of Norway; this is not a judicial office and not the head of the supreme court, but the head of human resources and support services. He served one term on the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women; his nomination over a more qualified woman and after the Foreign Ministry had ruled out even considering a woman was controversial and was widely condemned by the women's rights movement and the legal community in the Nordic countries as discriminatory towards women in itself, and was described as an example of radical gender quotas which are banned in Norway. Career in the Norwegian civil service He was born in Oslo, and graduated with the cand.jur. degree in 1974. In 1975, he worked as a research assistant at Aarhus University, after which he was hired as an administrative officer in the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications. He worked in the Norwegian Gender Equality Council from 1977 to 1979 and for the Norwegian Gender Equality Ombud (Eva Kolstad) from 1979 to 1986. From 1986 to 1989 he was the town clerk (byskriver) of Oslo, and from 1989 to 1994 he served as stipendiary magistrate (byfogd). In 1994 he became been the administrative director/secretary-general of the Supreme Court of Norway. In Norway this is neither a judicial office nor the head of the Supreme Court, but corresponds to the head of human resources, ranking below the chief justice and the 19 justices. He retired in 2019; originally it was announced that he would retire two years prior upon reaching the mandatory retirement age.Gunnar Bergby går av etter 25 år i Høyesteretts tjeneste Membership on the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women In 2016 the Norwegian government nominated him as a member of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, a UN body of experts on discrimination against women, and he was subsequently elected to this committee. His nomination was controversial because all the women's rights organizations in the Nordic countries had nominated Anne Hellum, the Director of the Institute of Women's Law at the University of Oslo and whose candidacy was also supported by the outgoing Nordic committee member Niklas Bruun, and because Bergby was regarded as being far less qualified than Hellum, having no academic publications in this field despite this being one of the key criteria. The nomination was criticized by several jurists and other experts on gender equality in Norway, among them Hege Skjeie, Inga Bostad, Helga Hernes, Cecilia Bailliet, Ingunn Ikdahl, Vibeke Blaker Strand and Aslak Syse, as discriminatory towards women. Bergby was the third man in a row from the Nordic countries nominated to this committee, while no women from the Nordic countries had been nominated since the 1990s; the women's rights NGOs in Norway were told by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that they refused to nominate a woman as a matter of principle because they wanted a man for the third time due to a need for \\"men's voices\\".Hilde Firman Fjellså: \\"Likestilling: Et liv i kamp: Anne Hellums yrkesliv startet med diskriminering.

Det er stilt spørsmål om Utenriksdepartementets nominasjon av en mindre kvalifisert mann er i tråd med norsk og internasjonalt regelverk som godtar moderat, men ikke radikal kjønnskvotering.\\"] Law professor at the University of Oslo Cecilia Bailliet stated that the women's rights NGOs in the Nordic countries were \\"shocked\\" over the government's nomination of Bergby over a more qualified woman and the Foreign Ministry's use of \\"radical gender quotas\\" to promote men to a body concerned with discrimination of women, and that Norway had backtracked on its commitments to gender equality. Bergby did not stand for reelection in 2020; despite the calls to nominate a woman from the Nordic countries over the past 20 years, the foreign ministry abstained from nominating a candidate.21st Meeting of States parties (New York, 29 June 2020, postponed): Election of eleven members of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to replace those whose terms are due to expire on 31 December 2020 References Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Norwegian civil servants Category:Norwegian jurists Category:People from Oslo ","title":"Gunnar Bergby"},{"id":"25779405","text":"Jeon Min-hee () is a South Korean fantasy writer.

The fourth and last tower on this particular site was constructed in 1857 and was in service for 130 years. The first three had been built in 1838, 1842, and 1846, in each case requiring replacement due to poor construction and/or encroaching lake waters.

The station was automated in 1941, and the keeper's house was removed in 1952, by which time the light was on an island instead of a peninsula. Pass Manchac Light was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The light was functionally replaced in 1987 by the U.S. Coast Guard, which established a skeleton tower on the south side of the pass entrance.

In 1999, Marcelo Camelo released the first album of the band Los Hermanos having written twelve of the fourteen tracks of the album.

A glance at the news, sometimes in short Mabat (Hebrew: מבט lit. view), was an Israeli flagship evening news program that aired continuously on the Israeli public channel from 1968 to May 9, 2017. It was Israel's first televised news program. Mabat in television The news program, which used to air daily on the public Channel 1, owned by the Israel Broadcasting Authority, had a broadcasting monopoly between 1968 and 1991. The show summarizes the daily news events, through video news stories and in-studio news announcings. The characteristics of the show have evolved over the years, especially in light of the rise of the commercial channels. The main modifications can be observed in the number of story-items, that have grown over the years, and that are being more fast-told, in a way that more closely resembles a commercial channel. In its first years as a monopoly news show, it included fewer story-items, and therefore was on a slower pace. Over the years, the story-items have grown, and thus also became shorter. The announcing form of the show have little to change over the years, and is still based on either one in-studio news presenter or an announcer, that occasionally interviews the experts in the field that is on the agenda of the daily news events. Alternately, over the years, the news show was presented by a male and female twosome. Israel is known as a country where the news always matters. During the 1970s and '80s, just before the creation of the first commercial channel (Israeli Channel 2), the program was so popular that people avoided talking on the phone in its broadcasting time. Calling someone during the broadcast was considered to be informal. Haim Yavin is the most veteran and known presenter of Mabat LaHadashot. He presented the first edition of Mabat in 1968 (which was the first television news program aired in Israel), and remained on the show for over 40 years. In the years that the show was a monopoly news show. Due to his presentation of the news there, Yavin earned the nickname \\"Mr. Television\\". Over the course of the years, \\"Mabat\\" was coined as the name for the news division of Channel 1, although the Channel 1 news division also produces many other news items and shows, but it was only the prime time news show on that channel. In June 2010, Mabat became the first Israeli news program to be broadcast in high definition (HD 1080i). Mabat on radio Mabat was also being simultaneously broadcast on Reshet Bet of Kol Yisrael radio. After years of being broadcast at 9 pm local time, it switched in May 2012 to 'shmoneh l'shmoneh' (eight minutes to eight).

Consonants with the tip of the tongue curled back against the palate are called retroflex. Characteristics The most common type of palatal consonant is the extremely common approximant , which ranks as among the ten most common sounds in the world's languages. The nasal is also common, occurring in around 35 percent of the world's languages,Ian Maddieson (with a chapter contributed by Sandra Ferrari Disner); Patterns of sounds; Cambridge University Press, 1984. in most of which its equivalent obstruent is not the stop , but the affricate . Only a few languages in northern Eurasia, the Americas and central Africa contrast palatal stops with postalveolar affricates - as in Hungarian, Czech, Latvian, Macedonian, Slovak, Turkish and Albanian. Consonants with other primary articulations may be palatalized, that is, accompanied by the raising of the tongue surface towards the hard palate. For example, English (spelled sh) has such a palatal component, although its primary articulation involves the tip of the tongue and the upper gum (this type of articulation is called palatoalveolar). In phonology, alveolo-palatal, palatoalveolar and palatovelar consonants are commonly grouped as palatals, since these categories rarely contrast with true palatals. Sometimes palatalized alveolars or dentals can be analyzed in this manner as well. Distinction from palatalized consonants and consonant clusters Palatal consonants can be distinguished from palatalized consonants and consonant clusters of a consonant and the palatal approximant . Palatal consonants have their primary articulation toward or in contact with the hard palate, whereas palatalized consonants have a primary articulation in some other area and a secondary articulation involving movement towards the hard palate. Palatal and palatalized consonants are both single phonemes, whereas a sequence of a consonant and is logically two phonemes. Irish distinguishes the palatal nasal from the palatalized alveolar nasal . In fact, some conservative Irish dialects have two palatalized alveolar nasals, distinguished as \\"fortis\\" (apical and somewhat lengthened) vs. \\"lenis\\" (laminal). Spanish marginally distinguishes palatal consonants from sequences of a dental and the palatal approximant: *uñón \\"large nail\\" :unión \\"union\\" Sometimes the term palatal is used imprecisely to mean \\"palatalized\\". Also, languages that have sequences of consonants and /j/, but no separate palatal or palatalized consonants (e.g. English), will often pronounce the sequence with /j/ as a single palatal or palatalized consonant. This is due to the principle of least effort and is an example of the general phenomenon of coarticulation. (On the other hand, Spanish speakers can be careful to pronounce /nj/ as two separate sounds to avoid possible confusion with .)

HFSP is supported by 13 countries and the European Union. Nobutaka Hirokawa has been its President and Chair of the Board of Trustees since 2012. History In 1986 a feasibility study was carried out by leading Japanese scientists under the auspices of the Japanese Prime Minister's Council for Science of Technology, to explore possible means to encourage international collaboration in basic research. Discussion was expanded to include scientists from the G7 summit nations and the European Union, resulting in the \\"London Wise Men's Conference\\" in April 1987, which endorsed the suggestion. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan proposed the Human Frontier Science Program at the Venice Economic Summit in June 1987. The Economic Summit partners and the Chairman of the European Community welcomed the initiative and activities aimed at implementing it were started. The implementing body, the International Human Frontier Science Program Organization (HFSPO) was established in 1989 and the secretariat was founded in Strasbourg, France. Since 1990, more than 6000 awards have been made to researchers from over 70 countries. Of these, 25 HFSP awardees have gone on to win the Nobel Prize for their scientific work. Funding thumbright401px HFSPO receives financial support from the governments or research councils of Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, UK, USA, as well as from the European Union (contributes on behalf of the non-G7 EU members). The funds are combined into a single budget and are allocated to awards on the basis of HFSPO's own peer review system on the sole basis of scientific excellence. Funding programs Research Grants are awarded for novel collaborations involving extensive collaboration among teams of scientists working in different countries and in different disciplines. Two types of grants are available: Young Investigator Grants and Program Grants. Postdoctoral Fellowships are available for scientists who wish to work in foreign laboratories, with emphasis on individuals early in their careers who wish to obtain training in a different field of research. Fellows who return to their home countries are eligible to apply for a Career Development Award. Cross- disciplinary fellowships are intended for postdoctoral fellows with a Ph.D. degree in the physical sciences, chemistry, mathematics, engineering and computer sciences who wish to receive training in biology. HFSP funding programs start at the postdoctoral level. No support is available for undergraduate or PhD students. HFSP peer review International peer review is a cornerstone of the procedures used in making awards. There is one review committee for Fellowships and one for Research Grants each consisting of 24 to 26 scientists. They have a broad international representation of scientific experts and each reviews applications in all scientific fields supported by the HFSP. This ensures that awards are made according to international scientific standards and the presence of reviewers from many countries minimizes geo-political bias. Extensive research is carried out into the expertise and reputation of potential members before appointment to ensure maintenance of the highest standards. The evaluation procedures are under constant review and the HFSP secretariat works closely with the members of the review committees and the Council of Scientists to ensure that all applications are assessed fairly and thoroughly. HFSP Nakasone Award In 2010, HFSP established the HFSP Nakasone Award to honour former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan for his vision in launching HFSP as a program of support for international collaboration and to foster early career scientists in a global context. The HFSP Nakasone Award is designed to recognise scientists who have undertaken frontier-moving research, including technological breakthroughs, which has advanced biological research. Both senior and junior scientists are eligible and peer-recognised excellence is the major criterion. The award can be made to an individual or a team of scientists. Award winners receive an unrestricted research grant of USD 10,000, a medal and personalised certificate. The award ceremony is held at the annual HFSP Awardees Meeting where the award winners are expected to deliver the HFSP Nakasone Lecture. Recipients of the Award: *2019 Michael N.

HFSP Journal Launched in October 2006, the HFSP Journal aims to foster communication between scientists publishing high quality, innovative research at the frontiers of the life sciences. Peer review is designed to allow for the unique requirements of such papers and is overseen by an Editorial Board with members from different disciplines. The HFSP Journal offers its authors the option to pay a fee to make their research articles Open Access immediately upon publication. For other articles, access is limited to subscribers for the first 6 months after publication, but access is free thereafter. The HFSP Journal ceased publication in July 2010 and was bought by the scientific publisher Taylor & Frances, to be re-launched in 2011 as “Frontiers in Life Science. In 2015 the HFSP reported that the former journal name had been hijacked in an apparent attempt to fraud researchers into publishing an apparent scam journal.

He was suspended from teaching as Professor of Divinity at the University of Glasgow for the rest of his life. Life Simpson was the eldest son of Patrick Simson (1628–1715), minister of Renfrew. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh where he graduated M.A. on 18 July 1692. He was then librarian at Glasgow College. On 13 July 1698 he was licensed by Paisley presbytery. He received instruction from Johannes Marck, professor of divinity at Leiden University from 1689 to 1731; his brother Matthew (1673–1756), minister at Pencaitland, Haddingtonshire, was entered at Leyden as a divinity student on 20 February 1699, and it is probable that Simson accompanied him, though he is not entered in the list of students. In poor health, he obtained no ministerial charge till 1705, when he was called to Troqueer, Kirkcudbrightshire on 21 June, and ordained there on 20 September 1708 he was promoted to be professor of divinity in the University of Glasgow, succeeding James Wodrow, father of Robert Wodrow. He lectured in Latin, using Marck's Medulla as his main text-book. He was never convicted of heresy. He adopted the maxim that reason is 'fundamentum theologiæ,' and his aim was to make orthodoxy intelligible. For 20 years the ranks of presbyterian clergy in the west of Scotland and north of Ireland were recruited from his pupils. In 1710 Simson discussed his views at Moffat with James Webster (1659–1720), minister of the Tolbooth Church, Edinburgh. Subsequently, he stated his position in correspondence with Robert Rowan (1660–1714), minister of Penningham, Wigtownshire, and with James Hog, editor of The Marrow. Webster first publicly attacked Simson in August 1712. On 17 March 1714 he made formal charges in the Edinburgh presbytery. Through the synod of Lothian the matter reached the General Assembly, and Webster, acting under the assembly's order, tabled his complaint before the Glasgow presbytery in the autumn. Simson gave in his replies on 29 March 1715, and the general assembly on 8 May referred the case to a committee of thirty ministers and six elders, on 13 May. At the head of the committee was William Carstares, who died before the end of the year. The leading theologians on it were James Hadow, and William Hamilton, D.D., Professor of divinity at Edinburgh. The gist of the accusation was that Simson had attributed too much to the \\"light of nature\\", but there were other charges, e.g. he held it probable that the moon was inhabited. At the assembly of 1716 the marrow-men clamoured for Simson's suspension, but the case was deferred till the next assembly, when Webster broke out (8 May 1717) with what Wodrow calls 'a dreadful sally.' At the next sitting he apologised. On 14 May 1717 the assembly found that Simson had 'vented some opinions not necessary to be taught in divinity,' and had employed expressions 'used by adversaries in a bad and unsound sense;' these were prohibited for the future, but no further censure was passed. The assembly was, in fact, being offered to choose between two extremes: on the same day judgment was given against the ‘Auchterarder creed’ (see Thomas Boston, the elder). Preaching at the outer church, Glasgow, on 19 May, Simson gave offence by allusions to his opponents. Eight years later his orthodoxy on the point of Christ's deity was impeached. He admitted changes in his treatment of the topic. Up to 1722 he had taken John Owen as his model; for two years (1723–24) he had specially controverted the semi-Arian teaching of Samuel Clarke; finding that this course had its dangers, he began in December 1725 to combat the opposite error of Sabellianism, and was in consequence accused of going over to Samuel Clarke. He defended himself by affirming his judgment that, in the then state of Scottish theology, there was danger of Sabellianism and Socinianism, none of Arianism. His own account is closely confirmed by the evidence of his students. On 16 February 1726 Charles Coats, minister of Govan, brought the matter before the Glasgow presbytery, who drew up six queries, which Simson declined to answer. Delay was caused by the state of Simson's health. Wodrow thought him 'in a dying condition,' and that his disorder had affected his mental health. He was unable to attend the assembly of 1726. On 18 May 1727 the assembly suspended him till the next assembly, and appointed a committee of twenty-one ministers and ten elders to co-operate with the Glasgow presbytery in preparing the case. On 16 May 1728, after receiving Simson's explanations and withdrawals, the assembly found his sentiments to be 'sound and orthodox,' but his teaching had been 'subversive,' and his explanations tardy. He was suspended till another assembly should take off the sentence; meantime the matter was to be referred to the presbyteries. Charles Owen, D.D. was present at this assembly. The action of the University of Edinburg in conferring (8 November) its diploma of D.D. upon four non- subscribers, including Owen, was viewed as a protest against the suspension of Simson. By the next assembly all the presbyteries but three or four had reported for Simson's deposition. Besides the 'marrow-men' a strenuous advocate for this course was Allan Logan (died 1733), minister of Culross. Finally, the suspension from all ecclesiastical function was confirmed on 13 May 1729. Simson was to retain the emoluments of his chair, though it was 'not fit or safe' that he should teach divinity. After suspension, Simson signed a student's testimonial as S.T.P. No provision was made for the duties of his chair, save that the principal, Neil Campbell, heard the discourses of bursars. Simson died on 2 February 1740. He printed nothing except the papers connected with his trials. His correspondence with Rowan was printed by Webster, Edinburgh, 1715, for presentation to the assembly. Family His wife was a niece of John Stirling (1662–1727), principal of Glasgow College. He had a son, born 1727, and a daughter, who married (1757) John Moore, and was the mother of Sir John Moore of Coruña. His sister Agnes married another John Simson, and was mother of Robert Simson and of Thomas Simson.

Valans comes under as the subcaste of Dheevara (caste). Dheevara (caste) is a grouping of fishing castes from the Kerala state of South India. According to some, the name derives from their use of tail nets (valu vala) for fishing. According to the people's traditional beliefs, they were brought to Kerala by Parasurama to work as boatmen, conveying passengers across the rivers and backwaters on the west coast. Another tradition is that the Valans were Arayans, and they became a separate caste only after one of the Perumal had selected some of their families for boat service, and conferred on them special privileges. They pride themselves that their caste is one of remote antiquity, and claim that ancient members included Vyasa, author of the Vishnu Purana, and Guhan, the legendary boatman who assisted Rama. There are no subdivisions in the caste, but the members are said to belong to four exogamous Illam (House of Namboothiri), namely, Alayakkad, Ennalu, Vaisyagiram and Vazhapally. These correspond to the gotras of the Brahmins, or to four clans, the members of each of which are perhaps descended from a common ancestor. According to a tradition current among them, they were once attached to the four Namboothiri illam above mentioned for service of some kind, and were even the descendants of the members of the illams, but were doomed to the present state of degradation on account of some misconduct. Even now, these Brahmin families are held in great respect by Valans, who when afflicted with family calamities, visit the respective illams with present of a few packets of betel leaves and few annas, to receive the blessing of Brahman masters, which, according to their belief, may tend to avert them.

Their single \\"Bones\\" reached no. 1 on the Billboard Active Rock charts in the US in May 2013. Their third album, Ones and Zeros, was released on 9 June 2015. The band's fourth album, Echoes, was released on September 16, 2016.  History = Mirrors EP and All Our Kings Are Dead (2008–2010)  While members of the band had been together dating back to 2003, during these years, they were more identified as just a number of musicians who shared a similar passion for music in the same London underground music scene, and did not form as a serious band until 2008. The band's lineup, upon becoming a formal band, consisted of Gustav Wood as the lead vocalist, Fraser and John Taylor both as guitarists, Simon Mitchell as the bassist, and Ben Jolliffe on drums. The band began playing local live shows at bars and small events featuring music from a variety of different music genre. They eventually began to garner more attention by securing spots in support of post-hardcore bands Funeral for a Friend and We Are the Ocean. This exposure granted them the opportunity to work with Dan Weller and Justin Hill, from the influential progressive metal band Sikth, as producers. The resulting work, the band's debut release, the EP Mirrors, was released on 22 June 2009. A single to promote the release, \\"In the Night\\", was also released in the same month. Despite touring and working with people from the hardcore and progressive metal music scene, the release contained more of a straightforward, melodic rock sound. The EP was not an immediate success, selling only 500 copies in its opening week, but the band continued to push forward with extensive touring. Mirroring the EP's sound, the band began touring with more mainstream rock bands, eventually leading to popular Welsh rock band Lostprophets approaching Young Guns to open for them. The touring, couple with positive coverage in the press, including a nomination from Kerrang magazine for \\"Best Newcomer Award\\" for 2009, greatly raised the band's public profile, leading to an opening spot for Bon Jovi at their residency at The O2 Arena, and Guns N' Roses at that year's Reading Festival. The band's unexpectedly quick rise to popularity left them in a rush to create more music to sustain their frequent touring. In January 2010, the band began work on their first full album. The band once again chose to work with Weller as a producer, and recorded their first full album while still continuing their extensive touring. Their first order was to record and release a single right away to capitalize on their recent high-profile live shows, which ended up being the track \\"Winter Kiss\\", released in the same month. The song was well-received, with BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe praising it as \\"The Hottest Record in the World\\". Further singles \\"Sons of Apathy\\" and \\"Crystal Clear\\" were released in April and July respectively while the band worked on completing the album. The debut album, All Our Kings Are Dead, was released under their own label called Live Forever on 10 July 2010 and peaked at No. 43 in the UK Albums Chart, and No. 3 in both the UK Rock and Indie album charts. Additional singles \\"Stitches\\" and \\"Weight of the World\\" were also released in promotion of the album. While all the singles received moderate radio play, both \\"Crystal Clear\\" and \\"Weight of the World\\" managed to chart, peaking at ninth and twenty-seventh respectively on the UK Rock Singles chart. To promote the album's release, the band played at some of the UK's largest festivals, including Download Festival and opening the main stage of the Reading Festival. This was preceded by a European tour supporting Danko Jones and their own UK Tour. In February 2011, the band supported All Time Low with Yellowcard on another European Tour which ended in the UK, visiting venues such as the O2 Academy Brixton. On 10 July 2011, the album was re- released as All Our Kings Are Dead: Gold Edition, including a bonus DVD containing three acoustic sessions, three live videos, a documentary and the music videos for all five singles.  Bones (2011–2013)  The band traveled to Karma Sound Studios in Thailand to start work on a second studio album in July 2011, again working with Weller as a producer. The first single from the sessions, \\"Learn My Lesson\\", was released four months later in October 2011, being debuted on Zane Lowe's Radio 1 show. The following month, the band announced the new album would be titled Bones, and would be released on 6 February 2012 in Europe. After the initial European release, the band proceeded to tour across Europe for six months while working on securing a distribution deal for the album in the US - which they eventually did with Wind-Up Records. The first leg of the tour was labeled the Bare Bones Club Tour; contrary to the band's large stadium shows with Bon Jovi, the initial shows were a number of intimate shows at small locations that the band had played in their earlier years. Bones was released in the US on 4 September 2012. Prior to the US release, the band had released a second single, \\"Bones\\", 20 February 2012. The song, the band's first single in the US, started off modestly in Europe, but upon release in the US, steadily grew until, after 32 weeks on the chart, topped the US Billboard Active Rock chart. The song also hit number 2 on the UK Rock charts. With the song being a massive hit, the band spent over two years touring in support of the album in total., including a North American tour with rock band Seether in late 2012, and additional touring with 10 Years, Bullet For My Valentine and Halestorm in 2013. Additional promotion came in the form of the song \\"Bones\\" being chosen as one of the main theme songs for WWE's 29th annual Wrestlemania event, WrestleMania 29, on 7 April 2013. Further singles \\"Dearly Departed\\", \\"Towers (On My Way)\\", and \\"You Are Not (Lonely)\\" were also released, the latter two charting more modestly at 31 and 33 on the US Active Rock charts.  Ones and Zeros (2014–2015)  It was announced in February 2014 that the band had signed to the Virgin EMI record label and that they would be flying to San Francisco to work on the follow up to Bones with the producer Dan the Automator. Unfortunately, while the band found the sessions interesting, they ultimately felt their sound was incompatible Dan the Automator's hip-hop background and approach to music, with the band instead choosing to work with Steve Osborne. The band spent 6 months straight on writing and recording the album, without touring, a rarity for the band. In August 2014, the band announced their plan on releasing a new album in early 2015, and debuted the first single for their third album, \\"I Want Out\\", on BBC Radio 1 UK Zane Lowe's Hottest Record The single hit number one on the iTunes Rock Chart, and eventually peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. Later in the month, a music video for \\"I Want Out\\" was also released. Work on the album continued through the rest of the year, with the band taking occasional breaks to perform live shows, most notably supporting Bring Me the Horizon for a sold out show at Wembley Arena in London in December. In February 2015, the band announced that the album's name would be Ones and Zeros, and that its release was pushed back to June 8, 2015. The band started the promotion for the album at the same time, releasing the second single \\"Speaking In Tongues\\". and embarking on that years Kerrang! Tour. Following that, they began a tour of their own around the UK. In April 2015 they began touring with Breaking Benjamin for the first leg of their US Tour with dates set through August. The band wrapped up their touring in support of the album in October 2015. Shortly after, the band amicably parted with their drummer, Ben Joliffe, stating that Joliffe and the band were heading in \\"different directions\\", later being revealed that he wanted to focus on his family life. The band recruited a new drummer, Chris Kamrada, and immediately began working on writing new material through the end of the year. Echoes and future releases (2016–present) The band, presented with the opportunity to work with music producer David Bendeth, decided to move quickly into recording another album, with sessions starting in February 2016 at the House of Loud studio. The sessions wrapped up in May 2016, and the band announced that the album was tentatively scheduled for release around August or September. To promote the release, the album's first single, \\"Bulletproof\\", was released in June 2016, while the second single, \\"Mad World\\", was released the next month. Additionally, the band toured as part of the 2016 iteration of the Vans Warped Tour through August. Their fourth album, titled Echoes, was released on September 16, 2016. In the months following the album's release, the band alternated touring between the United States and the UK. Wood states he would ideally like to start writing new material for a fifth studio album towards the end of 2016, but not necessarily have an album to release right away. The band spent 2017 split between touring and creating new music. The band toured the UK with Lower Than Atlantis in March, and did their own acoustic tour in the latter half of 2017. As of October 2017, Wood reported that the band had written 18 or 19 songs, planned on writing 5 or 6 more, and had 4 song far enough along that they played their demos over the speakers before and after their live performances. He reiterated that the band plans on releasing new music in 2018, but was unsure if it would be in the form of an album, an EP, or a series of singles. No release occurred in 2018, but as of April 2019, Wood and Taylor spoke of still actively writing new music for the band. As of 2020, the material still remained unreleased and without any specific plans for release, though the band planned to remain active, touring and playing All Our Kings Are Dead in its entirety for its tenth anniversary, until lockdown happened and the festivals they were due to play were cancelled.  Musical style and influences  The band has often been described as a general rock band that arose with the rest of the wave of British rock bands, but have also been labeled as \\"melodic rock\\" and hard rock. Wood reflected on the labels given to the band over time in 2013, stating: > When we started the band...We’d play with like tech metal bands or pop punk > bands and be stuck on all of these different bills and we just never seemed > to find a group of bands that we sonically worked with...So, people were > always putting labels on us and we were kind of surprised by all of this, > because as far as we’re concerned, we’re just a rock band.

Wood commented on the band's approach to music and sound again in 2016, stating: > I think we play a relatively American minded style of music but I think > we’re British and that seems to do something to it that makes people think > this is different...I think also that at the moment the world has so many > labels, pop punk, hardcore, metal.

(2008). Social Psychology and Human Nature (1st Edition). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth. According to Leary, self-esteem is the relationship between one's real self and one's ideal self, feeding off of favorable behaviors.Leary, M.R. (1999) Making Sense of Self-Esteem. Current Directions in Psychological Science 8 (1), 32–35. It refers to an individual's sense of their value or worth, or the extent to which a person values, approves of, appreciates, prizes, or likes themselves.Adler, N & Stewart, J ( 2004) Self-Esteem. Research Network on SES & Health. Self-esteem is generally considered the evaluative component of the self-concept, a broader representation of the self that includes cognitive and behavioral aspects as well as evaluative or affective ones. There are several different proposals as to the functions of self-esteem. One proposal is that it satisfies the inherent need to feel good about oneself. Another is that it serves to minimize social rejection.Anthony, D. B., Wood, J. V., & Holmes, J. G. (2007). Testing sociometer theory: Self-esteem and the importance of acceptance for social decision-making. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 43(3), 425-432. Self-esteem is also known as a way for a person to remain dominant in relationships (Barkow, 1980).Barkow, J. (1980). Prestige and self-esteem: A biosocial interpretation. In D. R. Omark, F. F. Strayer, & D. G. Freedman (Eds.), Dominance relations: An ethological view of human conflict and social interaction (pp. 319–332). New York: Garland STPM Press. Self-esteem is known to protect people from potential fear that arises from the prospect of death (terror management theory). Self-esteem helps motivate people to achieve their goals – high self-esteem leading to coping in situations and low self-esteem leading to avoidance. Evolutionary perspectives=Sociometer theory The sociometer theory was developed by Mark Leary (1999) to explain the functions of self-esteem. Leary and his colleagues stated that a sociometer is a measure of how a person is desirable by other people and this is oftentimes influenced through a person's self-esteem. They suggested that self-esteem has evolved to monitor one's social acceptance and is used as a gauge for avoiding social devaluation and rejection. The sociometer theory is strongly grounded in evolutionary theories which suggest that survival depends on social acceptance for reasons such as protection, reciprocal behaviours and most importantly reproduction. The monitoring of one's acceptance via self-esteem is therefore crucial in order to achieve these kinds of social interactions and be better able to compete for the social benefits of them. Kirkpatrick and Ellis (2003) expanded on Leary's work and suggested that the sociometer's function was not only to ensure that an individual was not excluded from their social group but also to rate the strength of the social group compared to other groups.Kirkpatrick, L. A., & Ellis, B. J. (2001). An evolutionary- psychological approach to self-esteem: multiple domains and multiple functions. In G. J. O. Fletcher & M. S. Clark (Eds.), Blackwell handbook of social psychology: Interpersonal processes (pp. 411-436). Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishers. Self-determination theory Self-determination theory (SDT) states that man is born with an intrinsic motivation to explore, absorb and master his surroundings and that true high self-esteem is reported when the basic psychological nutrients, or needs, of life (relatedness, competency and autonomy) are in balance. Ethological perspective The ethological perspective (Barkow, 1980) suggests that self-esteem is an adaptation that has evolved for the purpose of maintaining dominance in relationships. It is said that human beings have evolved certain mechanisms for monitoring dominance in order to facilitate reproductive behaviours such attaining a mate. Because attention and favorable reactions from others were associated with being dominant, feelings of self-esteem have also become associated with social approval and deference. From this perspective, the motive to evaluate oneself positively in evolutionary terms is to enhance one's relative dominance (Leary, 1999). Leary et al. (2001) tested the idea of dominance and social acceptance on self-esteem. Trait self-esteem appeared to be related to the degree to which participants felt accepted by specific people in their lives, but not to the degree to which participants thought those individuals perceived them as dominant. Acceptance and dominance appeared to have independent effects on self-esteem.Leary, M.R., Cottrell, C.A. & Phillips, M. (2001) Deconfounding the effects of dominance and social acceptance on self-esteem Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 81(5), 898-909. Terror management theory The terror management theory (TMT), developed by Sheldon Solomon at al. (1991),Solomon, S., Greenberg, J., & Pyszczynski, T. (1991). A terror management theory of social behavior: The psychological functions of self-esteem and cultural worldviews. Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 24, 93–159. which in relation to self-esteem states that having self-esteem helps protect individuals from the fear they experience at the prospect of their own death. It is suggested that people are constantly searching for ways to enhance their self-esteem in order to quell unconscious death anxiety. This internalisation of cultural values is also a key factor in terror management theory in which self-esteem is seen as a culturally based construction derived from integrating specific contingencies valued by society into one's own 'worldview'. High self-esteem promotes positive affect and personal growth, psychological well-being and coping as a buffer against anxiety in the knowledge of our eventual certain death, and reduces defensive anxiety related behaviour.Nayler, C. (2005) Theories of Self Esteem. Positive Psychology. Terror management theory, based primarily on the writings of Ernest Becker (1962, 1971, 1973, 1975) and Otto Rank (1936, 1941), posits that self-esteem is sought because it provides protection against the fear of death (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, & Solomon, 1986; Solomon, Greenberg, & Pyszczynski, 1991a). From this perspective, the fear of death is rooted in an instinct for self-preservation that humans share with other species.Jones, E. McGreggor, H. Pyszczynski, T. Simon, L. & Solomon, S. (1997). Terror Management Theory and Self–Esteem Reduces Mortality Salience Effects. Personality and Social Psychology 72, 24-36 Success Some researchers believe that having a high self-esteem facilitates goal achievement. Bednar, Wells, and Peterson (1989)Bednar, R., Wells, G., & Peterson, S. (1989). Self- esteem: Paradoxes and innovations in clinical theory and practice. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. proposed that self-esteem is a form of subjective feedback about the adequacy of the self. This feedback (self- esteem) is positive when the individual copes well with circumstances and is negative when he or she avoids threats. In turn, self-esteem affects subsequent goal achievement; high self-esteem increases coping, and low self- esteem leads to further avoidance (Leary, 1999). Illusion of control Illusion of control is the tendency for human beings to believe they can control, or at least influence, outcomes that they demonstrably have no influence over, a mindset often seen in those who gamble (Langer, 1975).Langer, E. J. & Roth, J. (1975). Heads I win, tails it's chance: The illusion of control as a function of the sequence of outcomes in a purely chance task. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 34, 191-198. However, for individuals who are not gamblers Taylor and Brown (1988) suggest it may serve to be a function of self-esteem. Belief that there is a level of control over the situation a person is in, may lead to an increased level of motivation and performance in a self-regulating manner.Taylor, S. E., & Brown, J. D. (1988). Illusion and Well-Being - a Social Psychological Perspective On Mental-Health. Psychological Bulletin, 103(2), 193-210. In other words, one will work harder to become successful if they believe they have control over their success. A high self-esteem would be needed for this belief of control and so the need for a sense of control may be a function of self-esteem. When applying sociometer theory, it suggests that the illusion of control is an adaptive response in order to self-regulate behaviour to cultural norms and thereby provide an individual with an increased level of self-esteem. In social psychology, the illusion of control is grouped with two other concepts and termed as the 'positive illusions'. Refer to link for a blog entry on illusion of control.

Arequipa Pottery differs from many Arts and Crafts pottery businesses because it was produced as part of the therapy process for women recovering from tuberculosis in the San Francisco Bay Area. The pottery was also produced from local clay. Founder - Dr. Philip King Brown Arequipa Pottery was established by Dr. Philip King Brown as part of the rehabilitative therapy program at a tuberculosis sanatorium located outside of Fairfax, California. The pottery was active from 1911 through 1918. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, dust-and ash-filled air contributed to a tuberculosis epidemic in San Francisco. The incidence of the disease was much higher among women than men. http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf187001tn/ Guide to the Arequipa Sanatorium Records, 1911-1958 The Arequipa Sanatorium, directed by Brown, was opened to serve women in the first stages of tuberculosis. At the time, the only known treatment was rest and good nutrition, in the hopes that the lungs could recover and heal. Brown got his first taste of running a sanatorium when he inherited a large house left to him by a wealthy relative located in Santa Barbara, California. The name of this facility was Miradero, established to rehabilitate \\"nervous cases.\\" At that time, treatment for tuberculosis, or TB, in a sanatorium was costly and there were few alternatives where working-class women could go to recover from this illness. Brown was active with the San Francisco Tuberculosis Polyclinic, which was a facility where people learned about the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis. This experience motivated Brown's desire to establish a facility which was affordable for working-class women. The Arts and Crafts Movement The Arts and Crafts movement flourished from 1860 - 1910. The movement encouraged production of hand crafted goods. The production and growth of American art pottery began in the 1870s with a group of women in Cincinnati, Ohio. The most famous pottery artists were Maria Longworth Nichols Storer (1849-1932) and Mary Louise McLaughlin (1847-1939). China painting was an activity considered appropriate for middle and upper class women during this time and influenced the decision to using ceramics as the choice of craft work to be produced at Arequipa. With the help of local artists and members of the area's philanthropic community, Brown introduced therapeutic handcrafts to the women. The Arts and Crafts Movement believed that crafts could provide great satisfaction. In addition, the director wanted to combat idleness, avoid the stigma of charity, and produce revenue. The idea of ceramics as a form of occupational therapy had been pioneered by a sanatorium at Marblehead, Massachusetts in 1904. Establishing the Sanatorium Brown's mother was Dr. Charlotte Blake Brown, a renowned physician in the early history of San Francisco. Dr. Brown received his medical degree from Harvard University in 1893. Brown then returned to California, established his practice and also was a teacher. In 1900, he married Helen Hillyer, who was mentored by Phoebe Apperson Hearst. As a result of this mentorship, Ms. Hillyer and the Hearst family remained friends for the rest of their lives. An Arequipa vase on display at LACMA. It has slip-trailed decoration featuring an ivy leaf design. In 1909 Henry Bothin, a philanthropist and business magnate who obtained is wealth through real estate, learned about Brown's desire to establish an affordable sanatorium and contacted him about building a clinic on some land he owned in Fairfax, California. In 1905 Bothin donated land in Fairfax to the Telegraph Hill Neighborhood House, a community center and clinic located in San Francisco. The property in Fairfax, called Hill Farm, provided a place where mothers and children convalesce from their ill health. Bothin offered a piece of land to Brown which was located below Hill Farm. It is of interest to note that this land was once owned by Phoebe Hearst. Brown accepted the offer from Bothin, and construction for the sanatorium began in April 1911 and officially opened on September 9, 1911. The official name of this institution was Arequipa Sanatorium and it was designed by well-known San Francisco architect John Bakewell. The name \\"Arequipa\\" - based on the name of the homonym city of Arequipa in Peru - is from a Peruvian aboriginal language which would allegedly mean \\"Place of rest\\", though this interpretation was actually based on some popular etymology. The Pottery Most of the clay used by the pottery was dug locally by boys who did the heavy work. The patients spent a limited number of hours per day finishing and decorating the pots. Production was directed by a succession of well-known ceramists: Frederick Hurten Rhead, Albert Solon, and Fred Wilde, who were responsible for the shapes of the ware, thus resulting in dramatic variations in style. The patients added surface decorations, either in the form of designs painted on the surface or patterns carved into the damp clay. Rhead, who headed the pottery from 1911 until 1913, trained as a potter in England. Prior to moving to California, he had worked for Edward Gardner Lewis at University City, Missouri where his activities included running a pottery correspondence course. Rhead introduced slip trailing, a technique which became the signature form of decoration of Arequipa pottery. The most common design under Rhead's tenure was a band of stylized ivy leaves.Dale, Sharon (1986), Frederick Hurten Rhead While Rhead's artistic talent was not in doubt, the management of the sanatorium were not happy with his approach to the pottery as a business. In July 1913 Rhead was replaced as director of the pottery by Albert Solon, who implemented cuts in running costs. Solon, like Rhead, was born in Staffordshire, England. Solon's brother Camille came to join him the following year. In 1915, at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, the Arequipa Tuberculosis Sanatorium exhibited its ceramic works in the fair's Palace of Education, where discharged patients demonstrated pottery-making and sold examples of the product. The Arequipa pottery ceased operation in 1918. As TB came under the control of antibiotic treatment, the sanatorium was converted to a hospital. Standards of care kept changing, and there was little need for it. After being closed in 1957, the hospital and sanatorium facility were offered for use as a Girl Scout camp in 1960. Eventually the property was donated to the local council, which raised funds for new facilities, such as a swimming pool. Other changes have been made so the property serves current needs. The Oakland Museum of California has the largest existing holding of pottery and tiles from Arequipa, with more than 100 pieces in its collections. The products of the Arequipa Pottery have become highly prized among collectors.

Different from the otherwise similar German evening school, Abendgymnasium, Kolleg classes are in the daytime. Both are state-run schools and do not charge tuition fees. Kolleg students can be eligible for financial aid as regulated in the German Federal Training Assistance Act, Berufsausbildungsförderungsgesetz. As a rule, the minimum entrance requirements for students are: 19 years of age or older, a Mittlere Reife school leaving certificate, and a formal vocational training completed. However, there are exceptions from that rule, e.g., previous long-term work experience (at least three years) without formal qualification can be recognized as sufficient substitute for vocational training, which also includes raising children and running a household. Kollegs may additionally require applicants to pass an entrance examination. Schools are in the competence of each federal state (bundesland), so that regulations may vary from bundesland to bundesland. The German term Kolleg should not be confused with the English term college. Other meanings of Kolleg in German * The word Kolleg is also used in some names of schools of different types, e.g., Aloisiuskolleg, the Kolleg St. Blasien and the Canisius-Kolleg Berlin. These are Gymnasium schools that have been using the word Kolleg since before the newer type of Kolleg was established. * Kolleg should not be confused with Studienkolleg, a preparatory course at German universities for applicants from abroad. (Like with Kolleg, there are also other schools which carry the word Studienkolleg in their name for reasons of tradition.) * Berufskollegs are vocational schools that can lead to university entrance qualifications (Fachhochschulreife or Abitur), as well as to certain formal vocational qualifications. Berufskollegs can vary from bundesland to bundesland. * Kollegschule in Germany was the term for a type of vocational school that existed specifically in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia until the end of the 20th century. These schools have been replaced by Berufskollegs.

It led to the abolition of tips being considered part of wages for the purpose of assessing compliance with the national minimum wage.The National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 (Amendment) Regulations 2009 (SI 2009/1902) reg 5 has removed the words \\"that is not paid through the payroll\\", which means that tips now cannot be taken as part of the employer's obligation to pay the minimum wage Facts Workers at a restaurant named Annabel's on Berkeley Square, in London's Mayfair, as well as George (Mount Street) Ltd and Harry's Bar Ltd had a \\"troncmaster\\" in charge of tips. Tips would be distributed to all the employees based on length of service under a points system. The troncmasters were the senior managers, and were given the job by the employer. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) issued National Minimum Wage Act 1998 (NMWA 1998) s. 19 enforcement notices, saying that the employer was not entitled to deduct the amounts distributed through this system from the workers' wages. It argued that the tronc system did not count under the National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 (NMWR 1999) r. 30(a) as \\"money payments paid by the employer to the worker\\". NMWR 1999 rr. 31–37 set out the reductions allowed and r 31(1)(e) said that money \\"paid by customers by way of a service charge, tip, gratuity or cover charge that is not paid through the payroll\\"The National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 (Amendment) Regulations 2009 (SI 2009/1902) reg 5 has removed the words \\"that is not paid through the payroll\\", which means that tips now cannot be taken as part of the employer's obligation to pay the minimum wage. is not a legitimate reduction. The amounts claimed to be outstanding were £49,862.45, £48,901.97 and £28,738.47 at the respective restaurants (so around £125,000). The employer's argument was that since the troncmaster was always contractually bound to distribute the money, or was the employer's agent and appeals about the process would always go to the employer, it never became the employees' money. In the alternative, the troncmaster was holding the money on a primary trust to pay the employees, or failing that for the employers, a Quistclose trust. HMR's argument was that when the money was handed over to the troncmaster, in his capacity as such, there was a trust for him to pay the money to the employees. Although the money started as the employer's, when given to the troncmaster, this meant the money was no longer being paid under r. 30(a) \\"by the employer\\". Mr Edge in the Employment Tribunal held that the tronc payments could be a part of the minimum wage and rescinded the enforcement notice, but Wilkie in the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) held they could not. Judgment Rimer upheld the EAT, and preferred HMRC's arguments, holding that the tips were not part of the pay and the restaurants were in breach of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. Mummery and Sullivan concurred. Significance Although the 2009 Statutory Instrument changed the law, it has been reported that many employers are breaching the new law and sticking with their old practice of taking their workers' tips.G Snowdon and M King, 'Law to stop restaurants misusing tips has failed, union claims' (1 October 2010) The Guardian See also *National Minimum Wage Act 1998 References Category:United Kingdom labour case law Category:Court of Appeal (England and Wales) cases Category:2009 in case law Category:2009 in British law ","title":"Annabel's (Berkeley Square) Ltd v Revenue and Customs Comrs"},{"id":"25779914","text":"Sayf al-Din (), also Saif al-Din, Sayf/Saif ad-Din, or Sayf/Saif ud-Din etc., may refer to: *Sayf al-Din Suri (died 1149), Ghurid king *Saif ad-Din Ghazi I (died 1149), Zangid emir of Mosul *Ghazi II Saif ud-Din (died 1180), Zangid emir of Mosul *al-Malik al-Adil Sayf al-Din Abu-Bakr ibn Ayyub, or just Al- Adil I, also known as \\"Saphadin\\", (1145–1218), Ayyubid sultan of Egypt *Sayf al-Din al-Amidi (died 1233), Islamic jurist *Saifuddin Aibak (died 1236), governor of Bengal *Saif ad-Dīn al-Malik al-ʿĀdil Abū Bakr b.

The period of composition of the work is uncertain. C.M. Whish, a civil servant of the East India Company, brought this work to the attention of European scholars for the first time in a paper published in 1834. The book is divided into ten chapters and is in the form of verses in Sanskrit. The sixth chapter contains series expansions for the value of the mathematical constant π, and expansions for the trigonometric sine, cosine and inverse tangent functions. Author and date of Karanapaddhati Nothing definite is known about the author of Karanapaddhati. The last verse of the tenth chapter of Karanapaddhati describes the author as a Brahamin residing in a village named Sivapura. Sivapura is an area surrounding the present day Thrissur in Kerala, India. The period in which Somayaji lived is also uncertain. There are several theories in this regard. *C.M. Whish, the first westerner to write about Karanapaddhati, based on his interpretation that certain words appearing in the final verse of Karanapaddhati denote in katapayadi system the number of days in the Kaliyuga, concluded that the book was completed in 1733 CE. Whish had also claimed that the grandson of the author of the Karanapaddhati was alive and was in his seventieth year at the time of writing his paper. * Based on reference to Puthumana Somayaji in a verse in Ganita Sucika Grantha by Govindabhatta, Raja Raja Varma placed the author of Karanapaddhati between 1375 and 1475 CE. *An internal study of Karanapaddhati suggests that the work is contemporaneous with or even antedates the Tantrasangraha of Nilakantha Somayaji (1465–1545 CE). Synopsis of the book A brief account of the contents of the various chapters of the book is presented below. :Chapter 1 : Rotation and revolutions of the planets in one mahayuga; the number of civil days in a mahayuga; the solar months, lunar months, intercalary months; kalpa and the four yugas and their durations, the details of kaliyuga, calculation of the Kali era from the Malayalam Era, calculation of Kali days; the true and mean position of planets; simple methods for numerical calculations; computation of the true and mean positions of planets; the details of the orbits of planets; constants to be used for the calculation of various parameters of the different planets. :Chapter 2 : Parameters connected with Kali era,the positions of the planets, their angular motions, various parameters connected with Moon. :Chapter 3 : Mean center of Moon and various parameters of Moon based on the latitude and longitude of the same, the constants connected with Moon. :Chapter 4 : Perigee and apogee of the Mars, corrections to be given at different occasions for the Mars, constants for Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn in the respective order, the perigee and apogee of all these planets, their conjunction, their conjunctions possibilities. :Chapter 5 : Division of the kalpa based on the revolution of the planets, the number of revolutions during the course of this kalpa, the number of civil and solar days of earth since the beginning of this kalpa, the number and other details of the manvantaras for this kalpa, further details on the four yugas. :Chapter 6 : Calculation of the circumference of a circle using variety of methods; the division of the circumference and diameters; calculation of various parameters of a circle and their relations; a circle, the arc, the chord, the arrow, the angles, their relations among a variety of parameters; methods to memorize all these factors using the katapayadi system. :Chapter 7 : Epicycles of the Moon and the Sun, the apogee and perigee of the planets; sign calculation based on the zodiacal sign in which the planets are present; the chord connected with rising, setting, the apogee and the perigee; the method for determining the end-time of a month; the chords of the epicycles and apogee for all the planets, their hypotenuse. :Chapter 8 : Methods for the determination of the latitude and longitude for various places on the earth; the R-sine and R-cosine of the latitude and longitude, their arc, chord and variety of constants. :Chapter 9 : Details of the Alpha aeries sign; calculation of the positions of the planets in correct angular values;; calculation of the position of the stars, the parallax connected with latitude and longitude for various planets, Sun, Moon and others stars. :Chapter 10 : Shadows of the planets and calculation of various parameters connected with the shadows; calculation of the precision of the planetary positions. Infinite series expressions The sixth chapter of Karanapaddhati is mathematically very interesting. It contains infinite series expressions for the constant π and infinite series expansions for the trigonometric functions. These series also appear in Tantrasangraha and their proofs are found in Yuktibhāṣā. Series expressions for π Series 1 The first series is specified in the verse which translates into the formula π/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... Series 2 A second series is specified in the verse and this can be put in the form π = 3 + 4 { 1 / ( 33 \\\\- 3 ) + 1 / ( 53 \\\\- 5 ) + 1 / ( 73 \\\\- 7 ) + ... } Series 3 A third series for π is contained in which is π = 3 + 6 { 1 / ( (2 × 22 \\\\- 1 )2 \\\\- 22 ) + 1 / ( (2 × 42 \\\\- 1 )2 \\\\- 42 ) + 1 / ( (2 × 62 \\\\- 1 )2 \\\\- 62 ) + ... } Series expansions of trigonometric functions The following verse describes the infinite series expansions of the sine and cosine functions. These expressions are sin x = x - x3 / 3! + x5 / 5! - ... cos x = 1 - x2 / 2! + x4 / 4! - ... Finally the following verse gives the expansion for the inverse tangent function. The specified expansion is tan−1 x = x - x3 / 3 + x5 / 5 - ...

For his \\"noble resignation\\" and self-sacrifice aboard the Duke William, Doiron was celebrated in popular print throughout the 19th century in England and America.The publications included John Frost, \\"The Book of Good Examples Drawn from History and Biography\\", New York: 1846, p.65; \\"The Saturday Magazine (magazine)\\" (1821), p. 502; Barrington's Remarkable Voyages and Ship Wrecks; and Reubens Percy, \\"Percey's Anecdotes\\", London (1868), p.425.

Doiron was commemorated in the naming of the village Noel, Nova Scotia and the surrounding communities of Noel Shore, East Noel (also known as Densmore Mills), Noel Road and North Noel Road.  Queen Anne's War  Benjamin Church: Father of American Ranging Noel Doiron was born at Port Royal, Acadia, but he lived most of his childhood at Pisiquid in the Parish of St. Famille (present-day Falmouth, Nova Scotia). During Queen Anne's War, Doiron was taken as a prisoner of war to Boston by Colonel Benjamin Church. In February 1704, New France orchestrated a raid with Abenaki allies on Deerfield, Massachusetts. During the raid, more than 100 captives were taken back to Montreal, Quebec, including women and children. Some were held for ransom or exchange, and others, usually young women and children, were adopted into local Mohawk families to replace members who had died. One of the prisoners taken was John Williams, the minister of the Deerfield church. Five months later Church was sent to Acadia to retaliate for the Deerfield raid and to capture prisoners to ransom the release of those taken in Quebec. In June 1704, Church sailed from Boston with 17 vessels and 550 men. He torched Acadian hamlets in an expedition that raided Grand Pré, Pisiguit, and Beaubassin. When Church returned to New England, he boasted that only five dwellings remained in all Acadia. He took 45 prisoners, including Noel Doiron, age 20, and his future wife Marie Henry.Mémoires de la Société généalogique canadienne-française 1994 -- Volumes 45-46 - Page 220.

On November 14, 1704 the Massachusetts House of Representatives expressed the opinion that the Acadians in the town were \\"under little or no restraint, which this House apprehend not safe.\\" The House demanded the hostages be imprisoned at Castle Island, just off the shore of Boston, and Fort Hill. On November 24, 1704, the Boston selectmen appealed to the Governor of Massachusetts \\"to restrain the French Prisoners from going about the town at their own pleasure, least their so doing may prove hazardous to this town.\\" The first group of Acadian prisoners were returned to Acadia in 1705. Noel and Marie Doiron were delayed in returning because the New Englanders had refused to release the notorious privateer Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste until John Williams was released. After two years in exile, Noel Doiron and the other Acadian prisoners finally returned to Acadia along with Pierre Masonnait. They arrived at Port Royal on September 18, 1706. Within three days of their arrival, Noel and Marie had their first child baptized at Port Royal. The baby was born while they were imprisoned in Boston. They married soon after the baptism.  Life in Vila Noel, Acadia  Map of Noel Shore (1756) By 1714, Doiron and his family were established in what is now known as Noel, Nova Scotia. The Doiron family grew to include five sons and three daughters—one son died in Vila Noel before 1746. The three daughters would marry and leave the village while the surviving sons married and remained with their parents. Doiron lived in the village for 40 years. During that time he and his family built dykes that still exist in the community, as well as a chapel at Burntcoat Head, Nova Scotia (formerly known as Steeple Point). As with most Acadians in the Cobequid region, Doiron was likely a cattle farmer involved in supporting trade with the French Fortress of Louisbourg.  King George's War  During King George's War, Doiron was involved in the aftermath of the Battle of Grand Pré. FWounded rench soldiers returning to Chignecto stopped at the village of Noel. Noel's priest cared for them until they continued their journey.  Father Le Loutre's War  Early in Father Le Loutre's War, the British established Halifax in 1749 and built fortifications in all the major Acadian communities. Shortly after, Noel's priest was arrested by the British and taken to Halifax. In response to the war and the British taking control over Acadia, the inhabitants of the parish sent a request for assistance to Acadians residing in Beaubassin. The message said that British soldiers, > \\"... came furtively during the night to take our pastor and our four > deputies ... [A British officer] read the orders by which he was authorized > to seize all the muskets in our houses, thereby reducing us to the condition > of the Irish [prohibited from keeping arms]... Thus we see ourselves on the > brink of destruction, liable to be captured and transported to the English > islands and to lose our religion.\\" Early in 1750, Doiron and his family joined the Acadian Exodus and left mainland Nova Scotia for Pointe Prime, Ile St. Jean (present day Eldon, Prince Edward Island).  Life on Ile St. Jean  Map of Ile St. Jean, 1784 The Doiron family lived for eight years at Pointe Prime, Ile St. Jean. Life there was difficult. The summer before the Noel Bay settlers arrived, a field mouse infestation had destroyed the crops on the island. The next summer a plague of locusts appeared, and the following summer was accompanied by a blistering drought. The census of 1752 reported: \\"the greater number amongst them had not even bread to eat ... [many] subsisted on the shell fish they gathered on the shores of the harbour when the tide was out.\\" Food shortages were exacerbated when the French government ordered Acadians to cease fishing and focus exclusively on crop production—crops were required for troops at Louisbourg. Faced with severe food shortages, the officials of Ile St. Jean pleaded for assistance from Louisburg, Quebec, and France. In 1752, the former residents of the Noel Bay settlement were joined at Pointe Prime by their former priest, Jacques Girard. Two years earlier, in March 1750, when Governor Edward Cornwallis arrested Girard, he confined him to the Governor's home in Halifax. Girard was charged with providing aid to representatives of the French Crown. After giving an oath to Cornwallis that he would never return to the Cobequid, Girard was reassigned to the Piziquid (present-day Windsor, Nova Scotia). He resumed his priestly duties until he was \\"rescued\\" by forces loyal to the French Crown and transported to Point Prime on Ile St. Jean. In a letter dated August 24, 1753, Girard wrote of the plight of the Pointe Prime Acadians: > Our refugees ... this winter will not be in any condition to work, they lack > tools, they cannot find shelter from the rigor of the cold by day or night. > Most of the children are so naked that they cannot hide it. And when I come > into the houses, they are all in the ashes near the fire, they hide and take > flight without shoes, without stockings, without shirts and all are not > reduced to such extremity but almost all of them are miserable. On October 27, 1753, Girard wrote that the situation remained unchanged. Despite these deprivations, the inhabitants of Pointe Prime constructed a parish church and a parochial residence at their own expense and labor.  French and Indian War  During the French and Indian War, the British began the Expulsion of the Acadians from mainland Nova Scotia in 1755. Many Acadians fled to Ile Saint Jean, putting further stress on scarce resources. A year later, in 1756, the continued famine on Ile St. Jean prompted authorities to relocate families to Quebec. This year of severe famine also marked the death of a Pointe Prime resident: one of Doiron's daughters-in-law. In 1758, after the Siege of Louisbourg (1758), the British began the Ile Saint-Jean Campaign to expel the Acadians, including Noel Doiron and his family, from Ile Saint Jean. The British authorities had given up on their earlier attempts to assimilate the Acadians into the American colonies and now wanted them returned directly to France. Approximately 4,600 Acadians lived on Ile St. Jean: a third were deported to France, a third eluded their British captors, and a third died en route to France. On October 20, 1758, Noel Doiron and most of the other inhabitants from the Noel Bay embarked for passage from Ile St. Jean to France on the Duke William. Captain William Nichols' account of the voyage across the Atlantic notes that the Duke William sprang a leak on the fifth day after leaving for France. The leak was sealed after nine days; however, on December 11 a more serious leak was discovered that threatened to compromise the completion of the voyage. The next day, those aboard the Duke William witnessed the sinking of the transport vessel Violet and the loss of 300 other Acadians who were on board. On December 13, two vessels approached the Duke William. Believing help had arrived, all assumed their ordeal had concluded. It was stated in one report, that upon seeing the approaching vessels, Noel Doiron gripped the Captain \\"in his aged arms and cried for joy.\\" The two vessels, however, refused to provide assistance and continued on their way. According to Nichols, Doiron again embraced the captain and requested that he, the captain, \\"... and his people [the crew] ... endeavor to save their own lives in their boats, and leave them [the Acadians] to their fate, as it was impossible the boats could carry all.\\" Two lifeboats were on board and these were lowered into the North Atlantic carrying only the captain, his crew, and the parish priest. Captain Nichols later recorded that during the departure Doiron reprimanded a fellow Acadian for trying to board a lifeboat while abandoning his wife and children. Captain Nichols records Doiron's final encounter with his priest Girard: \\"the priest went and gave his people his benediction: then, after saluting the old gentleman [Noel Doiron], he tucked up his canonical robes, and went in the boat.\\" The captain reported that Doiron and the other Acadians \\"in their last moments ... behaved with the greatest fortitude.\\" The Captain recorded that he and Doiron took \\"... leave of each other with tears in their eyes, and the captain requested that his people keep the boats near the ship, which he was determined not to quit himself until it was dark.\\" Doiron's priest Girard wrote that he \\"laid off the ship about half an hour, when their cries, and waving us to be gone, almost broke our hearts.\\" The Duke William drifted, according to Girard, \\"till it fell calm, and as [it] went down her decks blew up. The noise was like the explosion of a gun, or a loud clap of thunder.\\" The Duke William sank about 20 leagues from the coast of France in the English Channel shortly after 4:00 p.m. on December 13, 1758. Noel Doiron died on board along with his wife, Marie, five of their children with their spouses and over thirty grandchildren.  Commemorations  On 28 January 2019, a Nova Scotia school teacher was awarded the Governor General's History Award for her class' proposal to build a statue of Noel Doiron in Cornwallis Park. Her proposal was to include the existing Edward Cornwallis statue among three other statues of Acadian Noel Doiron, Black Nova Scotian Viola Desmond and Mi'kmaw Chief John Denny Jr. The four statutes would be positioned as if in a conversation with each other, discussing their accomplishments and struggles.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/temma-frecker-cornwallis- statue-project-booker- school-1.4994436https://www.canadashistory.ca/explore/awards/2018-finalists- for-the-governor-general-s-history-award-for-excellence-in-teaching * John Frost, \\"The Book of Good Examples Drawn from History and Biography\\", New York: 1846, p. 65; * \\"The Saturday Magazine (magazine)\\" (1821), p. 502; * Barrington's Remarkable Voyages and Ship Wrecks 1880 * Reuben Percy and Sholto Percy, Percy's Anecdotes, London (1868), p. 425\\\\. *London Magazine or Gentleman's Monthly Intelligencer, 1758  References  External links  *Film short on Noel and Marie Doiron: \\"The Exiles\\" * CBC Radio Documentary: \\"Noel Doiron and the Wreck of the Duke William\\" *Letter from Captain William Nichols dated December 16, 1758 *Captain William Nichols site Category:Acadian people Category:Hants County, Nova Scotia Category:People from Hants County, Nova Scotia Category:Pre-Confederation Nova Scotia people Category:1684 births Category:1758 deaths Category:Deaths due to shipwreck ","title":"Noël Doiron"},{"id":"25780043","text":"(lit. The Never-setting Sun) is a 2009 Japanese film directed by Setsurō Wakamatsu. It is also known as The Unbroken in the United States. Shizumanu Taiyō is based on a novel by Toyoko Yamasaki which centers on Hajime Onchi, an employee of \\"NAL,\\" a large national airline. The first part of the novel focuses on Onchi's activity as the chairman of the employees' union in the 1960s; his reward for fighting for better working conditions for the staff is a series of postings abroad, to Pakistan, Iran, and finally Kenya, a destination to which the company does not even fly. The second and third parts of the novel take place in 1985 and chronicle the crash of a jumbo jet and its aftermath within the company. The events portrayed in the story are based upon actual events that took place at Japan Airlines. The character of Onchi is based upon JAL labor organizer and author Hirotaro Ogura, and the pivotal crash portrayed in the novel is based closely upon the crash of Japan Airlines Flight 123 (up to having the same flight number and taking place at the same location, date and time). Several politicians and JAL executives portrayed in the story are also based on real-world counterparts. JAL objected strongly to both the novel and the film, stating that they were defamatory to the airline and disrespected the victims of the actual Flight 123. The novel claims to be a work based upon real-life events, while the film claims to be entirely a work of fiction. The cast of the film includes Ken Watanabe as Onchi, with Kōji Ishizaka, Kyōko Suzuki, Yasuko Matsuyuki and Tomokazu Miura in supporting roles. The violininst Diana Yukawa, whose father died in the real-world crash of JAL Flight 123, was involved in the music for the film. The premiere was on 24 October 2009 in Ginza.

It is found on the Moluccas, New Guinea, Indonesia, Australia and the Solomon Islands. Subspecies *Appias ada ada *Appias ada thasia (Papua) *Appias ada caria (north-eastern Australia) *Appias ada solstitialis Description The wingspan of males is 59 mm, while in females it is 54 mm.Braby, M., 2000, 'Butterflies of Australia: Their Identification, Biology and Distribution' Upper segment of the forewings are white with a black costa, as well as black dots along the margin. Males have a white dot near the apex. The hind wings also have black margins, however are coloured a pale yellow. The underside of both male and female forewings are white with a black costa, while hindwing undersides are yellow. In the female, the black sections of the underside are larger, and the apex of the forewing is more rounded. A. ada males are visually similar to those of D. ennia, especially the subspecies D. e. tindalti, both of which occur in the Cape York region of Australia. The distinguishing feature is the lack of orange spots on the hind wing's underside. Life cycle Eggs: Laid singularly, placed on the young shoots of their food source. Shaped like a spindle (height of 1 mm, width of 0.5mm), and initially white, they change to orange before hatching. Larva: 35 mm long; blue-green body, with \\"numerous blue conical tubercles, a yellow middorsal line, and a white ventrolateral line\\". The head is pale yellow, with blue stripes. Feed on the young shoots of Crateva religiosa, also known as Temple Plant. It does not survive if fed older leaves. Pupa: 27mm long. Yellow with black dorsal spots. Black spine with a white cremaster. Life cycle is completed within three weeks of summer: egg 4 days, larva 10 days, pupa 6 days Ecology Occurrence records show the habitat of A. ada to range from open woody trees to sparse grasses. Of the various species, only A. a. caria is apparent in Australia, to which it is endemic. The larva rests on the midrib of a leaf, spinning a slik pad on which it sits. Adults often fly rapidly along watercourses, and have been recorded all months excluding March. The mitochondrial genome for A. ada has been sequenced.

He is a plushie created and operated by Berit Nermoen, who also writes the scripts. The puppet was created in 2007 by visual artist Tiina Suhonen, in co-operation with costume department in NRK. With his slightly mischievous personality, he has become one of NRK's most popular characters for children. As a result of the success there has been made music videos, books and licensed products with Fantorangen and he acts with Berit Nermoen at various festivals and other cultural events. History Fantorangen was originally called Orangufanten, and was a mixture of an orangutan and an elephant. Orangufanten was created by Endre Skandfer at Qvisten Animation for a vignette for Nrk's BarneTV. Later he was redesigned and renamed fantorangen for the launch of the TV channel NRK Super. Fantorangen was given his present form in 2007, by Stig Saxegaard at Qvisten Animation, for a new set of animated vignettes. NRK later made a puppet of him. The leading puppetmaker was visual artist Tiina Suhonen. In December 2007 he debuted with his own program for the youngest children (2–18 years) in conjunction with the launch of the new channel NRK Super. The program ran seven days a week for 30 minutes, and Fantorangen typically made two or three appearances. The character Fantorangen featured in an episode of Lilyhammer in which it was stolen from the prop store at the TV studios and used to entertain children and the twins at their birthday party. Setting Initially Fantorangen lived in a submarine in the ocean. He told stories about growing up in the jungle, and his experiences with friends in the sea. At that time, his favorite food was introduced as sjøbanan (\\"sea-banana\\"). The big change came with the new program in 2010 that led to significant changes in setting. Gone was the submarine, and in its place there was a kind of Caribbean pirate atmosphere of jungle and pirate ship. This was, however, limited in duration, and in 2011 was replaced by a simpler set design based on a nest in which Fantorangen lives.

During this period a combination of low coal stockpiles and the effects of the cold weather on the transport network led to a shortage of fuel reaching power stations, forcing many to shut down or reduce their outputs. The Royal Navy responded by authorising the Submarine Service to carry out Operation Blackcurrant. The operation involved mooring submarines at harbours and docks and using their onboard diesel generators to provide supplementary power to dockyards and coastal towns. By February conditions had improved and power stations began to receive sufficient supplies of fuel. Background The United Kingdom was subjected to a period of cold temperatures and heavy snowfall that began in late January 1947 and would last into March. During this period the country also suffered from a shortage of coal, the principal fuel used in power stations at the time. This was partly due to low stocks of coal being kept in the aftermath of the Second World War but was also caused by the government relying on over optimistic production reports issued by the National Union of Mineworkers... The cold weather caused a higher than normal demand for coal and power as the country tried to keep warm. At the same time it became more difficult for coal to reach the power stations as it was frozen solid in stockpiles. Where coal was available it was hard to transport with many roads impassable, 750,000 railway waggons of coal trapped by snow and sea conditions too rough to allow transport by collier. As a result many power stations were forced to shut down or reduce their output due to a lack of fuel.. In an effort to reduce electricity consumption the Minister of Fuel and Power, Emanuel Shinwell cut electricity supply to industry completely and reduced the domestic supply to 19 hours per day across the country. Television services were suspended completely, radio broadcasts were reduced, some magazines were ordered to stop being published and newspapers were cut in size to four pages. The Operation Despite Shinwell's measures the fuel supply remained insufficient and blackouts occurred across large swathes of the country with even the staff at Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament and London's Central Electricity Board reduced to working by candlelight. The Royal Navy responded by launching Operation Blackcurrant. The operation saw the deployment of all available submarines to ports and docks where they were moored up and their on-board diesel-powered generators used as an electricity supply. The operation was used to supply power to the navy-owned bases of Devonport Dockyard, Plymouth and Chatham Dockyard, Kent. As part of the operation the T class submarine HMS Truculent was deployed to Brighton to provide power to the town. The job was uncomfortable for the submarine crews involved as it required them to work in cold and draughty conditions as the submarines' diesel engines required a constant flow of air. By 27 February sea conditions had improved and more than 100 coal ships had managed to unload their cargoes at the power stations, easing the fuel crisis.

It is a scientific and cultural truism that self- evaluation is motivated. Motives influence the ways in which people select self-relevant information, gauge its veracity, draw inferences about themselves, and make plans for the future. Empirically-oriented psychologists have identified and investigated Three cardinal self-evaluation motives (or self-motives) relevant to the development, maintenance, and modification of self-views. These are self-enhancement, self-assessment and self-verification. Types=Self-Enhancement The self-enhancement motive is the motive to improve the positivity of one's self-concept, and to protect the self from negative information (we search for positivity and avoid negativity). This motive influences people's self-evaluations. For instance, people process information important to the self in a selective manner, focusing on information that has favourable implications to the self and discarding information with unfavourable implications. People also choose to compare themselves socially to others so as to be placed in a favourable position. By doing this, people seek to boost the (self-evaluated) positivity of themselves or to decrease its negativity, hence increasing their levels of self-esteem with the aim of having others see them as more socially desirable. Self- Assessment The self-assessment motive is based on the assumption that people want to have an accurate and objective evaluation of the self. To achieve this goal, they work so as to reduce any uncertainty about their abilities or personality traits.Sedikides, C. (1993). Assessment, enhancement, and verification determinants of the self-evaluation process. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 65, (2), 327–338. Feedback is sought to increase the accuracy and objectivity of previously formed self-conceptions. This is regardless of whether the new information confirms or challenges the previously existing self-conceptions. Self-Verification The self- verification motive asserts that what motivates people to engage in the self- evaluation process is the desire to verify their pre-existing self- conceptions, maintaining consistency between their previously formed self- conceptions and any new information that could be important to the self (feedback) By doing this, people get the sense of control and predictability in the social world.In some of the literature, other motives appeared, namely the self-improvement motive, but they are not mentioned in this articles due to a lack of consensus about their existence. Conditions=Self- Enhancement The self-enhancement motive states that people want to see themselves favourably. It follows that people should choose tasks with a positive valence, regardless of task diagnosticity (this motive is more active in presence of tasks high in diagnosticity of success than in presence of tasks high in diagnosticity of failure).Sedikides, C. and Strube, M. J. (1995). The multiply motivated self. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21, 1330–1335. Tasks that disclosure a failure and negative feedback are considered less important than tasks with an outcome of success or positive feedback. As a result, the former are processed faster and more thoroughly, and remembered better than the latter. Each motive originated a different type of reaction (cognitive, affective or behavioural). The self- enhancement motive creates both affective and cognitive responses. Affective responses result in negative feedback leading to less positive affect then positive affect. This is moderated by trait modifiability, in the sense that we can find the former event to be especially true for unmodifiable traits. On the other hand, cognitive responses lead to favourable feedback being judged as more accurate, but only in the case of modifiable traits. Self- Assessment The self-assessment motive postulates that people want to have an accurate view of their abilities and personality traits. Hence, when evaluating the self people tend to preferably choose tasks that are high in diagnosticity (people want to find out about their uncertain self- conceptions). This is found even when the diagnosis leads to a disclosure of failure (i.e., regardless of task valence). The responses generated by the self-assessment motive are behavioural responses, which becomes evident by the fact that people choose to receive feedback on their performance (they prefer tasks for which feedback is available, opposed to tasks with unavailable feedback). This pattern is emphasized when the trait is considered to be modifiable. Self-Verification The self-verification motive asserts that people want to verify their previously existing beliefs about the self. No preference regarding the task valence is apparent. Regarding task diagnosticity, people seek knowledge about their certain self-conceptions to a greater extent than they do for their uncertain self-conceptions.Baumeister, R. F. (ed.). (1999). The self in social psychology. Philadelphia: Psychology Press. Cognitive responses guide the self-verification motive partially depending on their previously formed self-concept. That is, when a certain trait is present, positive feedback regarding this trait is judged to be more accurate than unfavourable feedback; but when in the presence of the alternative trait, there isn’t any difference in the judgement of the feedback accuracy. However, this pattern is conditional on perceived trait modifiability.Dauenbeimer, D. G., Stablberg, D., Spreemann, S., and Sedikides, C. (2002). Self-enhancement, self-verification, or self-assessment: the intricate role of trait modifiability in the self-evaluation process. Revue internationale de psychologie sociale, 15, (3-4), 89-112. The self- verification motive resulted in cognitive responses to traits considered to be unmodifiable, but not to traits considered modifiable. In the former, positive feedback is considered more accurate than negative feedback, when in the presence of the trait. On the other hand, negative feedback is viewed as more accurate than positive feedback in the presence of the alternative trait.

Biography Gaspar da Cruz was admitted to the Order of Preachers (Dominican order) convent of Azeitão. In 1548, along with 10 other friars.\\"The Portuguese empire, 1415–1808: a world on the move\\", p. 92, A. J. R. Russell-Wood Gaspar da Cruz embarked for Portuguese India under the orders of Friar Diogo Bermudes, with the purpose of founding a Dominican mission in the East. For six years, Cruz remained in Hindustan, probably in Goa, Chaul and Kochi, as his Order had established a settlement there. During this time he also visited Portuguese Ceylon. In 1554, Cruz was in Malacca, where he founded a house under his Order, living there until September 1555. He was then shipped to Cambodia. Given the failure of the Cambodian mission, in late 1556 Cruz went to Lampacao, a small island in the Guangzhou bay, six leagues north of Shangchuan Island (Sanchão). At that time, Lamapacao island was a port for trade with the Chinese. At Lampacao, he was able to obtain a permission to go to Guangzhou, and spent a month preaching there. In 1557, Cruz returned to Malacca. In 1560, Cruz headed to Hormuz where he gave support to soldiers of the Portuguese fort. He probably returned to India about 3 years later, although there are no definite records for this period. It is likely that Cruz returned to Portugal in 1565, returning to Lisbon in 1569, where he was documented helping victims of the plague. He later returned to his convent in Setúbal where he died of the plague on February 5, 1570. A Treatise of China The title page of Gaspar da Cruz' Treatise Cruz's book, Tratado das cousas da China (Treatise on things Chinese) was published by André de Burgos, of Évora, in 1569. The full title, in the original orthography, was Tractado em que se cõtam muito por estẽso as cousas da China. It is often described as the first European book whose main topic was China;\\"The first European book devoted exclusively to China\\", in \\"The first European to have published a book on Ming China\\", in: at any rate, it is one of the first undisputed books on China published in Europe since that of Marco Polo. The book also contains accounts of Cambodia and Hormuz. Influence In Donald F. Lach's assessment, Cruz' book itself did not become widely distributed in Europe either because it was published in Portuguese (rather than some more widely spoken language), or because it appeared in the year of the plague. Nonetheless, Cruz' book, at least indirectly, played a key role in forming the European view of China in the sixteenth century, alongside the earlier and shorter account by Galeote Pereira (1565).\\"First globalization: the Eurasian exchange, 1500 to 1800\\", p.200, Geoffrey C. Gunn Cruz' Treatise (along with João de Barros' earlier coverage of China in his Decadas) was the main source of information for Bernardino de Escalante's Discourso ... de las grandezas del Reino de la China (1577), and one of the main sources for the much more famous and widely translated History of the great and mighty kingdom of China compiled by Juan González de Mendoza in 1585. While Escalante's and Mendoza's works were translated into many European languages within a few years after the appearance of the Spanish original (the English versions were published in 1579 and 1588, respectively), Cruz' text only appeared in English in 1625, in Samuel Purchas' Purchas his Pilgrimes, and even then only in an abridged form, as A Treatise of China and the adjoining regions, written by Gaspar da Cruz a Dominican Friar, and dedicated to Sebastian, King of Portugal: here abbreviated. By this time his report had been superseded not only by Mendoza's celebrated treatise, but also by the much more informed work of Matteo Ricci and Nicolas Trigault, De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas (Latin 1616; English abridgment, in the same Purchas' collection of 1625). Chinese language and writing Reading Gaspar da Cruz' Treatise, one has an impression that, as of 1555, communication between the Portuguese and the Chinese was accomplished primarily thanks to the existence of some Chinese people able to speak Portuguese, rather than the other way around. His book several times mentions Chinese interpreters working with Portuguese, but never a Portuguese person speaking or reading Chinese. (This was not any different from the situation that obtained in the accounts of da Cruz' Spanish colleague Martín de Rada's expedition to Fujian in 1575). The Portuguese, of course, did know some Chinese words and common expressions: da Cruz' book contains, for example, titles of various officials, or the word cha (\\"tea\\"). Da Cruz was, however, curious about the Chinese writing system, and gave a brief report of it, which John DeFrancis has described as \\"the first Western account of the fascinatingly different Chinese writing.\\" Slavery One of the major irritants in the early Sino-Portuguese relations was the Portuguese' proclivity to enslave Chinese children and take them to various Portuguese colonies, or to Portugal itself. While this traffic was on a much smaller scale than the Atlantic slave trade, supplying millions of African slaves for Portuguese Brazil, it was a contributing factor already to the failure of the Tomé Pires' 1521 embassy, when, in a words of a later researcher, many residents of Canton discovered that \\"many of their children, whom they had given in pledge to their creditors, had been kidnapped by\\" Simão de Andrade \\"and carried away to become slaves\\".. According to Cortesão's later research, the letters were actually written in 1524. Gaspar da Cruz was aware of this trade, and, as his book (Chapter XV) implies, he had heard of the Portuguese slavers' attempts to justify their actions by claiming that they had been merely buying children that already were slaves while in China. Da Cruz described the situation with slavery in China as he saw it. According to him, the laws of China allowed impoverished widows to sell her children; however, the conditions under which boys or girls sold into servitude could be kept were regulated by law and custom, and upon reaching a certain age they had to be set free. Reselling of such slaves (or, rather, bond-servants) was regulated too, there being \\"great penalties\\" for selling any of them to the Portuguese. He concludes therefore (as C.R. Boxer summarizes his argument), that \\"the Portuguese had no legal or moral rights to purchase either mui-tsai or kidnapped children for use as slaves\\": God's punishment for sins In the first paragraph of the last chapter (XXIX) of his book Cruz severely criticized \\"a filthy abomination, which is that they are so given to the accursed sin of unnatural vice, which is in no way reproved among them.\\"Hinsch, Bret. (1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve. Published by University of California Press. p. 2 The rest of the chapter, entitled \\"Of some punishments from God which the Chinas received in the year of fifty-six\\", discusses the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake and certain flooding events of the same year, which da Cruz views as God's punishment for \\"this sin\\".

It was to comprise 3 regiments of Imperial Yeomanry, 26 artillery batteries (17 Regular, 6 Militia and 3 Volunteer) and 25 infantry battalions (2 Regular, 13 Militia and 10 Volunteers). Under Army Order No 38 of 1907 the corps titles disappeared.Dunlop. World War I=Operations around Ypres VI Corps was organised within Sir Herbert Plumer's Second Army of the British Expeditionary Force on 1 June 1915. It was placed under the command of Lt-Gen Sir John Lindesay Keir, promoted from command of 6th Division. Initially it comprised 4th Division from V Corps and 6th Division from III Corps, and it took over the left of the British line at Ypres.Official History 1915 Vol II, p 86.Who Was Who 1929-40. VI Corps cooperated with the attack by its neighbour V Corps on Bellewaarde Ridge on 16 June 1915 with rifle and artillery fire, and in July and August 1915 it was engaged in trench fighting round Hooge Chateau.Official History 1915 Vol II, pp 99, 102-8. The corps was first seriously engaged in the Second Battle of Bellewaarde, a subsidiary attack to assist First Army's attack at Loos on 18 September 1915.Official History 1915 Vol II, p 139. Phosgene attack Before dawn on 19 December 1915 VI Corps was the victim of the first German attack with phosgene gas. It had 6th Division and 49th Division holding the line and 14th (Light) Division in reserve. The attack was made by the German XXVI Reserve Corps between the Roulers and Staden railways, NW of Ypres. The attack was designed to test new weapons (the gas released was an 80:20 mixture of chlorine and phosgene) and to inflict casualties. There was some shelling, but apart from sending out infantry and air patrols to gauge the effectiveness of the gas cloud, the Germans made no attempt to advance. VI Corps' anti-gas measures were reasonably effective, and a pre-arranged counter-barrage of shrapnel shells discouraged the enemy patrols. The British reserves stood to, but were not required. A total of 1069 gas casualties (120 fatal) were suffered, three- quarters by 49th Division.Official History 1916, Vol I, pp 158-62. 1916 In early 1916 the expanding BEF was reorganised, and VI Corps became part of Sir Edmund Allenby's Third Army in the Arras sector, with which it remained until the Armistice.Official History 1916, Vol I, p 39.

During the phase known as the First Battle of the Scarpe (9–14 April), 37th Division of VI Corps captured Monchy- le-Preux.

The German counter-offensive VI Corps fought in the Battle of St Quentin (21–23 March), and the First Battle of Bapaume (24–25 March), the opening phases of the German 1918 Spring Offensive (Operation Michael), otherwise known as the 'First Battles of the Somme 1918'.The First Battles of the Somme 1918 Order of Battle of VI Corps March 1918 GOC: Lt-Gen Sir Aylmer Haldane *Guards Division *3rd Division *31st Division *34th Division *40th Division *59th (2nd North Midland) Division *42nd (East Lancashire) Division - replaced 34th Division at Bapaume. By the end of the month, VI Corps was back where it had been a year earlier, fighting a new Battle of Arras on 28 March. For this action Haldane had 2nd Canadian Division and 97th Brigade of 32nd Division under command, as well as Guards, 3rd and 31st Divisions. 32nd Division took part in the Battle of the Ancre on 5 April.

During the Final Advance in Picardy, VI Corps fought in the Battle of the Selle (17–25 October) and the Battle of the Sambre (4 November).Official history 1918, Vol V.The final advance in Picardy German resistance was now crumbling, and the Allied advance had become a pursuit. During the night of 8/9 November, the reserve of Guards Division, 3rd Battalion Grenadier Guards, was pushed ahead through a black night with its machine guns on pack mules to seize the citadel of the old French frontier fortress of Maubeuge, which the Germans had captured after a siege in 1914. The main German defence line was now seven miles away. By 11 November when the Armistice came into effect, the 62nd and Guards Divisions were the advance guard of Third Army, but were doing no more than pushing forward infantry outposts and cyclist patrols against the dissolving German forces.Official history 1918, Vol V, pp 529, 553.

Tweed knew Haldane, who had raised the money for Tweed's sculpture of Lt-Gen Sir John Moore at Shorncliffe, and Haldane offered the sculptor facilities with VI Corps HQ. Tweed spent the last five months of the war as a civilian member of the corps staff, and accompanied the troops into the Rhineland. Although one of Tweed's studies entitled Attack was exhibited, the ambitious architectural monument that he designed for South Africa was never executed.Tweed pp 172-4. NotesReferences *Col John K.

The clade Chaoyangopteridae was first defined in 2008 by Lü Junchang and David Unwin as: \\"Chaoyangopterus, Shenzhoupterus, their most recent common ancestor and all taxa more closely related to this clade than to Tapejara, Tupuxuara or Quetzalcoatlus\\". Based on neck and limb proportions, it has been suggested they occupied a similar ecological niche to that of azhdarchid pterosaurs,http://pterosaur.net/species.php though it is possible they were more specialised as several genera occur in Liaoning, while azhdarchids usually occur by one genus in a specific location. The Chaoyangopteridae are mostly known from Asia, though the possible member Lacusovagus occurs in South America and there are possible fossil remains from Africa, including the possible member Apatorhamphus. Microtuban may extend the clade's existence into the early Late Cretaceous.Wilton, Mark P. (2013). Pterosaurs: Natural History, Evolution, Anatomy. Princeton University Press. . Chaoyangopterids are distinguished from other pterosaurs by several traits of the nasoantorbital fenestra, a large hole on the side of the snout formed by the assimilation of the nares (nostril holes) into the antorbital fenestra. In members of this family, the nasoantorbital fenestra is massive, with the rear edge extending as far back as the braincase and jaw joint. The front edge is formed by a rod of bone known as the premaxillary bar, which is unusually slender in members of this family. Like their azhdarchid relatives, chaoyangopterids were terrestrial predators.Wen-Hao Wu; Chang-Fu Zhou; Brian Andres (2017). \\"The toothless pterosaur Jidapterus edentus (Pterodactyloidea: Azhdarchoidea) from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota and its paleoecological implications\\".

Greenwood, Peter B. Bazin, John Dwight and Samuel Jackson.Laws of the commonwealth of Massachusetts. January, 1818; p.473. It featured displays of fine art, natural history specimens, wax figures, and other curiosities. Bands of musicians typically performed there during public hours. History Around 1818, Greenwood bought Edward Savage's \\"New York Museum\\" art collection, and thus established the New England Museum. Artwork acquired included Savage's own paintings—a portrait of George Washington and his family (now in the National Gallery of Art); portraits of Henry Knox; portraits of Robert Morris; and Congress Voting Independence, a painting begun by Robert Edge Pine and completed by Savage. Greenwood expanded the museum collections in 1821 by acquiring items from the estate of John Mix of New Haven, Connecticut. Mix's collection \\"consisted of wax figures as large as life, paintings, beasts, birds, fishes, serpents and reptiles, Indian and Chinese curiosities and 20,000 different species of insects preserved in glass cases.

He is a partner of Steinberg Hart and was founding partner of Holzman Moss Bottino Architecture (HMBA) and Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates (HHPA). Holzman has planned, programmed, and designed over 130 projects for public use; including 35 library projects during the last five decades. Life and career Holzman was born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1940. He received a B. Arch. from Pratt Institute in 1963, and in 1964 began working with Hugh Hardy. Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates (HHPA) was established in New York City in 1967. In 1981 HHPA received the AIA’s Architecture Firm Award. Also, in 1981, Holzman was elected to the college of Fellows at the American Institute of Architects. In 2004 HHPA separated and Holzman established HMBA with members of his HHPA project team. In October 2019 Holzman Moss Bottino Architecture merged with California-based Steinberg Hart, and Holzman became a partner of Steinberg Hart. Paul Goldberger describes how Holzman “tends to hide behind a sort of ‘Aw, Shucks’ manner, which belies the seriousness with which he takes his profession.”Golberger, P., “Brash, Young, and Post-Modern,” New York Times Magazine (20 February 1977) He has held both the Saarinen and Davenport Visiting Professorships at Yale University, and endowed chairs at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Ball State University, the University of Texas, Syracuse University, Texas Tech University, the City College of New York, as well as teaching at Lawrence Technological University and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.HHPA press release, 1999 Holzman is a member of the Interior Design Hall of Fame, the Municipal Art Society, the Architectural League of New York, and has served as a trustee of the Amon Carter Museum and Pratt Institute. Style Holzman has designed many important civic and academic structures throughout the United States, especially libraries, museums and performing arts venues. His collagist plans with rotated grids, diagonals and eclectic sensibilities, quickly established him as a pioneer.Andres, Glenn M. Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates: Concepts and Buildings. Middlebury, Vermont: Middlebury College Museum of Art, 1993. p 15. His use of industrial and rural vernacular, as well as salvaged and local materials ran counter to reductionist modernist tendencies, resulting in a more humanist approach. In addition Holzman advocated the reuse of older buildings at a time when the profession embraced pristine modernism, exemplified by urban renewal. Holzman was an early advocate of sustainable building practices. Holzman has expressed his belief that the most effective and often overlooked method of greening modern building practices is to repurpose existing buildings and to design buildings with longer lifespans. Holzman's signature is a courageous and creative materials palette, and he has recently published two books on the subject. \\"No other contemporary architect uses traditional and unconventional materials with such invention, exuberance and wit.” Webb, Michael. Form Magazine (July /August 2009) p.14 Holzman's interiors are \\"legendary\\" for his bold and eclectic use of color, pattern and texture, exemplified by his custom-designed fabrics, upholstery and carpeting.Martinson, Tom. The Atlas of American Architecture. Rizzoli International Publications, 2009. p 241. Holzman frequently uses stone, usually as large blocks with rich texture in a load-bearing capacity, as opposed to the contemporary stone veneers of curtain wall construction.Martinson, p 243. He often collaborates with artists and incorporates their works into his buildings, most notably Albert Paley and Tom Otterness. Early on, Holzman avoided characterizations or a design manifesto. Practicing in an era when architecture became increasingly dominated by factions, Holzman was an architect who “would rather build than talk,” believing that successful buildings are not born from theory but from careful attention to location and clients.Andres, p 14. This garnered Peter Eisenman’s pejorative assessment of “functionalism in drag.” His 50-year career has spanned the majority of the Late Modernist movement.

During the Anglo-Saxon period, the main forms of taxation were land taxes, although custom duties and fees to mint coins were also imposed. The most important tax of the late Anglo-Saxon period was the geld, a land tax first regularly collected in 1012 to pay for mercenaries. After the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, the geld continued to be collected until 1162, but it was eventually replaced with taxes on personal property and income. Background Britannia, the southern and central part of the island of Great Britain, was a province of the Roman Empire until the Roman departure from Britain in around 400 AD. The Emperor Honorius told the Britons in 410 that they were responsible for their own defence,Kirby Making of Early England pp. 13–14 and from then until the landing of Augustine of Canterbury in the Kingdom of Kent in 597 as part of the Gregorian mission, little is known about Britain's governmental structures or financial systems.Blair Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England p. 2 Anglo-Saxon England (597–1066) The first unequivocal mention of taxation in Anglo-Saxon England comes from the Law of Æthelberht, the law code of King Æthelberht of Kent, which specifies that fines from judicial cases were to be paid to the king. No other forms of taxes are mentioned in Æthelberht's law code, but other forms of taxation are implied by the grant of an exemption from taxation given by another king, Wihtred of Kent, to a church. Other mentions of taxes are contained in the law code of King Ine of Wessex. Although other early Anglo-Saxon kings are not mentioned as collecting taxes, the medieval writer Bede does mention that land in Anglesey and the Isle of Man were divided up in hides, defined in Ine's law as a unit of land that could be used for collecting food and other goods from the king's subjects. A document from the 7th or 8th century, the Tribal Hidage, shows that much of the Anglo-Saxon lands had been divided into hides by that time. Charters from the time of King Offa of Mercia show that tolls were collected on trade, and it was during Offa's reign that coinage in silver pennies was first introduced into Anglo-Saxon England. Coinage became a royal right, and was probably introduced to make payment of taxes easier.Lawson \\"Taxation\\" Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England In early Anglo-Saxon England the hide was used as the basis for assessing the amount of food rent (known as feorm) due from an area. Initially the size of the hide varied according to value and resources of the land itself.Faith \\"Hide\\" Anglo-Saxon England pp. 238-239 Over time the hide became the unit on what all public obligation was assessed. Tenants had a threefold obligation, based on their landholding, they had to provide manpower for the so-called \\"common burdens\\" of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair.Hollister Anglo-Saxon Military Institutions pp. 59-60 With increasing problems from raiding Vikings, the Anglo-Saxon leaders raised taxes, also based on the landholding(or hidage) of their tenants. The tax was known as Danegeld and was used to pay the raiders off rather than fight. In the 9th century Alfred the Great confronted the Viking problem. After his victory over them at the Battle of Edington (878) he set about building a system of fortified towns or forts, known as burhs. He also updated the traditional fyrd to provide a standing army and navy. To fund all of these changes Alfred required a new system of tax and conscription that is contained in a document, now known as the Burghal Hidage. The Burghal Hidage contains a list of over thirty fortified places and the taxes, recorded as numbers of hides, assigned for their maintenance.Lapidge Anglo-Saxon England p. 76 After Alfred's death his son Edgar developed the tax system further by periodically recalling and reminting all the coinage, with the moneyers being forced to pay for new dies. All profits from these actions went to the king, and were a royal right. Despite all these changes, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records payment of £132,000 in tribute to the Scandinavian attackers from 991 to 1012.Loyn Governance of Anglo-Saxon England p. 121 The year 1012 saw the introduction of the geld or heregeld (literally \\"army tax\\"), an annual tax first assessed by King Æthelred the Unready to pay for mercenaries in the army and navy. The reinforced military was needed, in the face of an invasion of England, by King Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark. Later, after the conquest of England by Sweyn's son Cnut the Great, the geld was continued. This tax used similar machinery for collection as Danegeld and was again based on the amount of hides a tenant had. The amount due from each hide was variable. In 1051 Edward the Confessor abolished heregeld and saved money by selling off his navy, giving the responsibility of naval defence to the Cinque ports in return for various privileges. However, heregeld was possibly reinstated in 1052.Keynes \\"Heregeld\\" Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England Norman and Angevin England (1066–1216) There was no formal division between the household of the king and the government in the Norman period, although gradually the household itself began to separate from the government. Thus, income from taxation merged with other income to fund the king and the government without any distinctions such as in the modern world.Saul \\"Government\\" A Companion to Medieval England pp. 115–118 Under the Norman and Angevin kings, the government had four main sources of income: (1) income from lands owned directly by the king, or his demesne lands, (2) income that derived from his rights as a feudal overlord, the feudal rights such as feudal aid or scutage (3) taxation, and (4) income from the fines and other profits of justice. By the time of King Henry I, most revenues were paid into the Exchequer, the English Treasury, and the first records of the Exchequer date from 1130, in the form of the first surviving Pipe Roll for that year. From the reign of King Henry II, Pipe Rolls form a mostly continuous record of royal revenues and taxation.Coredon Dictionary p. 219 However, not all revenue went into the Exchequer, and some occasional taxes and levies were never recorded in the Pipe Rolls.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 159 Taxation itself took a number of forms in this period. The main tax was the geld, still based on the land, and unique in Europe at the time as being the only land tax that was universal on all the king's subjects, not just his immediate feudal tenants and peasants. It was still assessed on the hide, and the usual rate was 2 shillings per hide. In certain circumstances, however, taxation was assessed in terms of services rendered to the crown, such as Avera and Inward.Darby and Campbell Domesday Geography of South-East England p. 72 Because the geld was assessed on landowners, it only applied to free men who owned land, and thus serfs and slaves were exempt. Other exemptions were granted to favoured subjects or were a right that went with certain governmental offices.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings pp. 165–168 The geld was unpopular, and because of the increasing number of exemptions, yielded smaller amounts. During the reign of King Stephen, it is unclear if the geld was collected at all, as no financial records survive. However, when King Henry II came to the throne, the geld was collected once more.Huscroft Ruling England pp. 98–99 After 1162, however the geld was no longer collected. Instead, a new type of tax was imposed starting in 1166, although it was not an annual tax. This was the tax on moveable property and income, and it could be imposed at varying rates. Likewise, the Saladin tithe, imposed in 1188 to raise funds for a proposed crusade by King Henry II, was levied at the rate of 10% of all goods and revenues, with some exceptions for a knight's horse and armour and clerical vestments. Also excluded were those who had pledged to go on crusade with the king. In 1194, in part from need to raise the huge sums required for the ransom of King Richard I who was captive in Germany, a new land tax was instituted. This was the carucage, and like the geld it was based on the land. The carucage was imposed six times in all, but it produced smaller sums than other means of raising revenue and was last collected in 1224. In 1194, as part of the attempts to raise Richard's ransom, a 25% levy on all personal property and income was imposed. In other years, other rates were set, such as the thirteenth imposed in 1207. Besides taxes on land and taxes on personal property, this period saw the introduction of taxes on trade. In 1202, King John imposed a custom duty of a fifteenth of the value of all goods imported or exported. It appears, however, that these duties were discontinued in 1206. Plantagenet England (1216–1360) During the reign of King Henry III, the king and government sought consent from the nobles of England for taxes the government wished to impose. This led in 1254 to the start of the Parliament of England, when the nobles advised the king to summon knights from each shire to help advise and consent to a new tax. In the 1260s, men from the towns were included with the knights, forming the beginnings of the House of Commons of England.Saul \\"Taxation\\" Companion to Medieval England pp. 281–283 By the middle of the 13th century, the tax on moveable property had become fixed by convention at a fifteenth for those in the country, and a tenth for those living in towns. An innovation in 1334 was the replacement of the individual assessments by a lump sum assessment for each community. In 1275, King Edward I reestablished a customs duty, by setting a rate of a mark on each sack of wool (weighing ) or 300 wool-fells, and a mark on a last of hides. Edward then added another tax, the maltolt, in 1294, on sacks of wool, which was in addition to the previous customs duty. These taxes were removed in 1296, but in 1303 they were reimposed but only on non-English merchants. Over the next 40 years, the maltolt was the subject of dispute between the king and Parliament, with the final result being that the tax was kept at a lower rate but that Parliament's consent was required to impose it. Late medieval England (1360–1485) The revenues from the traditional sources of taxation declined in later medieval England, and a series of experiments in poll taxes began: in 1377 a flat rate tax, in 1379 a graduated tax.Speight Craven and North-West Yorkshire Highlands pp. 29–60 By 1381, the unpopularity of these taxes had contributed to the Peasants' Revolt. Later experiments in income taxes during the 15th century did not manage to raise the sums needed by the government, and other taxes, such as taxes on parishes, were attempted.

Montgomery in 1987. It is used for certain computations, and in particular in different cryptography applications. Definition A Montgomery curve of equation \\\\frac{1}{4}y^2=x^3+2.5x^2+x A Montgomery curve over a field is defined by the equation :M_{A,B}: By^2 = x^3 + Ax^2 + x for certain and with . Generally this curve is considered over a finite field K (for example, over a finite field of elements, ) with characteristic different from 2 and with and , but they are also considered over the rationals with the same restrictions for and . Montgomery arithmetic It is possible to do some \\"operations\\" between the points of an elliptic curve: \\"adding\\" two points P, Q consists of finding a third one R such that R=P+Q; \\"doubling\\" a point consists of computing [2]P=P+P (For more information about operations see The group law) and below. A point P=(x,y) on the elliptic curve in the Montgomery form By^2 = x^3 + Ax^2 + x can be represented in Montgomery coordinates P=(X:Z), where P=(X:Z) are projective coordinates and x=X/Z for Z e 0. Notice that this kind of representation for a point loses information: indeed, in this case, there is no distinction between the affine points (x,y) and (x,-y) because they are both given by the point (X:Z). However, with this representation it is possible to obtain multiples of points, that is, given P=(X:Z), to compute [n]P=(X_n:Z_n). Now, considering the two points P_n=[n]P=(X_n:Z_n) and P_m=[m]P=(X_m:Z_m): their sum is given by the point P_{m+n}=P_m+P_n = (X_{m+n}:Z_{m+n}) whose coordinates are: : X_{m+n} = Z_{m-n}((X_m-Z_m)(X_n+Z_n)+(X_m+Z_m)(X_n-Z_n))^2 : Z_{m+n} = X_{m-n}((X_m-Z_m)(X_n+Z_n)-(X_m+Z_m)(X_n-Z_n))^2 If m=n, then the operation becomes a \\"doubling\\"; the coordinates of [2]P_n=P_n+P_n=P_{2n}=(X_{2n}:Z_{2n}) are given by the following equations: : 4X_nZ_n = (X_n+Z_n)^2 - (X_n-Z_n)^2 : X_{2n} = (X_n+Z_n)^2(X_n-Z_n)^2 : Z_{2n} = (4X_nZ_n)((X_n-Z_n)^2+((A+2)/4)(4X_nZ_n)) The first operation considered above (addition) has a time-cost of 3M+2S, where M denotes the multiplication between two general elements of the field on which the elliptic curve is defined, while S denotes squaring of a general element of the field. The second operation (doubling) has a time-cost of 2M + 2S + 1D, where D denotes the multiplication of a general element by a constant; notice that the constant is (A+2)/4, so A can be chosen in order to have a small D. Algorithm and example The following algorithm represents a doubling of a point P_1=(X_1:Z_1) on an elliptic curve in the Montgomery form. It is assumed that Z_1=1. The cost of this implementation is 1M + 2S + 1*A + 3add + 1*4. Here M denotes the multiplications required, S indicates the squarings, and a refers to the multiplication by A. : XX_1 = X_1^2 \\\\, : X_2 = (XX_1-1)^2 \\\\, : Z_2 = 4X_1(XX_1+aX_1+1) \\\\, Example Let P_1=(2,\\\\sqrt{3}) be a point on the curve 2y^2 = x^3 -x^2 + x. In coordinates (X_1:Z_1), with x_1=X_1/Z_1, P_1=(2:1). Then: : XX_1 = X_1^2 = 4 \\\\, : X_2 = (XX_1-1)^2 = 9 \\\\, : Z_2 = 4X_1(XX_1+AX_1+1) = 24 \\\\, The result is the point P_2=(X_2:Z_2)=(9:24) such that P_2=2P_1. Addition Given two points P_1=(x_1,y_1), P_2=(x_2,y_2) on the Montgomery curve M_{A,B} in affine coordinates, the point P_3=P_1+P_2 represents, geometrically the third point of intersection between M_{A,B} and the line passing through P_1 and P_2. It is possible to find the coordinates (x_3,y_3) of P_3, in the following way: 1) consider a generic line ~y=lx+m in the affine plane and let it pass through P_1 and P_2 (impose the condition), in this way, one obtains l=\\\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} and m=y_1-\\\\left(\\\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\\\right)x_1; 2) intersect the line with the curve M_{A,B}, substituting the ~y variable in the curve equation with ~y=lx+m; the following equation of third degree is obtained: : x^3+(A-Bl^2)x^2+(1-2Blm)x-Bm^2=0. As it has been observed before, this equation has three solutions that correspond to the ~x coordinates of P_1, P_2 and P_3. In particular this equation can be re-written as: : (x-x_1)(x-x_2)(x-x_3)=0 3) Comparing the coefficients of the two identical equations given above, in particular the coefficients of the terms of second degree, one gets: : -x_1-x_2-x_3=A-Bl^2. So, x_3 can be written in terms of x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, as: : x_3 = B\\\\left(\\\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\\\right)^2-A-x_1-x_2. 4) To find the ~y coordinate of the point P_3 it is sufficient to substitute the value x_3 in the line ~y=lx+m. Notice that this will not give the point P_3 directly. Indeed, with this method one find the coordinates of the point ~R such that R+P_1+P_2=P_\\\\infty, but if one needs the resulting point of the sum between P_1 and P_2, then it is necessary to observe that: R+P_1+P_2=P_\\\\infty if and only if -R=P_1+P_2. So, given the point ~R, it is necessary to find ~-R, but this can be done easily by changing the sign to the ~y coordinate of ~R. In other words, it will be necessary to change the sign of the ~y coordinate obtained by substituting the value x_3 in the equation of the line. Resuming, the coordinates of the point P_3=(x_3,y_3), P_3=P_1+P_2 are: : x_3 = \\\\frac{B(y_2-y_1)^2}{(x_2-x_1)^2}-A-x_1-x_2=\\\\frac{B(x_2y_1-x_1y_2)^2}{x_1x_2(x_2-x_1)^2} : y_3 = \\\\frac{(2x_1+x_2+A)(y_2-y_1)}{x_2-x_1}-\\\\frac{B(y_2-y_1)^3}{(x_2-x_1)^3}-y_1 Doubling Given a point P_1 on the Montgomery curve M_{A,B}, the point [2]P_1 represents geometrically the third point of intersection between the curve and the line tangent to P_1; so, to find the coordinates of the point P_3=2P_1 it is sufficient to follow the same method given in the addition formula; however, in this case, the line y = lx + m has to be tangent to the curve at P_1, so, if M_{A,B}: f(x,y)=0 with : f(x,y)=x^3+Ax^2+x-By^2, then the value of l, which represents the slope of the line, is given by: : l=-\\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right/\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial y } by the implicit function theorem. So l = \\\\frac{3x_1^2 + 2Ax_1 + 1}{2By_1} and the coordinates of the point P_3, P_3=2P_1 are: : \\\\begin{align} x_3 & = Bl^2-A-x_1-x_1 = \\\\frac{B(3x_1^2+2Ax_1+1)^2}{(2By_1)^2}-A-x_1-x_1 \\\\ & =\\\\frac{(x_1^2-1)^2}{4By_1^2} =\\\\frac{(x_1^2-1)^2}{4x_1(x_1^2+Ax_1+1)} [8pt] y_3 & = (2x_1+x_1+A)l-Bl^3-y_1 \\\\ & = \\\\frac{(2x_1+x_1+A)(3{x_1}^2+2Ax_1+1)}{2By_1}-\\\\frac{B(3{x_1}^2+2Ax_1+1)^3}{(2By_1)^3}-y_1. \\\\end{align} Equivalence with twisted Edwards curves Let K be a field with characteristic different from 2. Let M_{A,B} be an elliptic curve in the Montgomery form: : M_{A,B} : Bv^2 = u^3 + Au^2 + u with A\\\\in K\\\\smallsetminus{-2,2}, B \\\\in K\\\\smallsetminus{0} and let E_{a,d} be an elliptic curve in the twisted Edwards form: : E_{a,d}\\\\ :\\\\ ax^2 + y^2 = 1 + dx^2y^2, \\\\, with a,d\\\\in K\\\\smallsetminus{0}, \\\\quad a eq d. The following theorem shows the birational equivalence between Montgomery curves and twisted Edwards curve: Theorem (i) Every twisted Edwards curve is birationally equivalent to a Montgomery curve over K. In particular, the twisted Edwards curve E_{a,d} is birationally equivalent to the Montgomery curve M_{A,B} where A = \\\\frac{2(a+d)}{a-d}, and B = \\\\frac{4}{a-d}. The map: : \\\\psi\\\\,:\\\\,E_{a,d} \\\\rightarrow M_{A,B} : (x,y) \\\\mapsto (u,v) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{1+y}{1-y},\\\\frac{1+y}{(1-y)x}\\\\right) is a birational equivalence from E_{a,d} to M_{A,B}, with inverse: : \\\\psi^{-1}: M_{A,B} \\\\rightarrow E_{a,d} : (u,v) \\\\mapsto (x,y) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{u}{v},\\\\frac{u-1}{u+1}\\\\right), a=\\\\frac{A+2}{B}, d=\\\\frac{A-2}{B} Notice that this equivalence between the two curves is not valid everywhere: indeed the map \\\\psi is not defined at the points v = 0 or u + 1 = 0 of the M_{A,B}. Equivalence with Weierstrass curves Any elliptic curve can be written in Weierstrass form. In particular, the elliptic curve in the Montgomery form : M_{A,B}: By^2 = x^3 + Ax^2 + x, can be transformed in the following way: divide each term of the equation for M_{A,B} by B^3, and substitute the variables x and y, with u=\\\\frac{x}{B} and v=\\\\frac{y}{B} respectively, to get the equation : v^2 = u^3 + \\\\frac{A}{B}u^2 + \\\\frac{1}{B^2}u. To obtain a short Weierstrass form from here, it is sufficient to replace u with the variable t-\\\\frac{A}{3B}: : v^2 = \\\\left(t-\\\\frac{A}{3B}\\\\right)^3 + \\\\frac{A}{B}\\\\left(t-\\\\frac{A}{3B}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\frac{1}{B^2}\\\\left(t-\\\\frac{A}{3B}\\\\right); finally, this gives the equation: : v^2 = t^3 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{3-A^2}{3B^2}\\\\right)t + \\\\left(\\\\frac{2A^3-9A}{27B^3}\\\\right). Hence the mapping is given as : \\\\psi: M_{A,B} \\\\rightarrow E_{a,b} : (x,y) \\\\mapsto (t,v) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{B} + \\\\frac{A}{3B}, \\\\frac{y}{B}\\\\right), a=\\\\frac{3-A^2}{3B^2}, b=\\\\frac{2A^3-9A}{27B^3} In contrast, an elliptic curve over base field \\\\mathbb{F} in Weierstrass form : E_{a,b}: v^2 = t^3 + at + b can be converted to Montgomery form if and only if E_{a,b} has order divisible by four and satisfies the following conditions: # z^3 + az + b = 0 has at least one root \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}; and # 3\\\\alpha^2 + a is a quadratic residue in \\\\mathbb{F}. When these conditions are satisfied, then for s = (\\\\sqrt{3\\\\alpha^2 + a})^{-1} we have the mapping : \\\\psi^{-1}: E_{a,b} \\\\rightarrow M_{A,B} : (t,v) \\\\mapsto (x,y) = \\\\left(s (t-\\\\alpha), s v\\\\right), A = 3 \\\\alpha s, B = s .

After graduating school he moved to San Diego, California to pursue a career in Skateboarding. It was in San Diego where Terry was first introduced to Turntablism. Urban moved back to his hometown of Cleveland and began to DJ and also paint graffiti. In 2004 he was hired to be a DJ on a local Cleveland radio station WENZ and then quickly after was hired as a DJ with his own show at Sirius Satellite Radio. Urban's career as a DJ began to flourish and he became less interested in graffiti. In 2006 Terry decided to pursue his career as DJ and moved to New York City. Terry began to work on music and started to produce his own remixes which have received accolades from such greats as Coldplay, Jay Z, Kanye West and Drake. In 2015 looking for another creative outlet, Urban began to paint once again. Over the past years, Terry Urban has completely immersed himself into his work and has exhibited his paintings in many solo shows.  Music  Terry Urban has released mixtapes including \\"Unbelievable\\" (tribute to The Notorious B.I.G., hosted by P. Diddy), \\"The Graduate (hosted by Kanye West) and Viva La Hova, which mashed up Jay-Z and Coldplay.Norris, John. \\"Jay-Z And Coldplay Make 'Sonic Alchemy' On Viva La Hova Mixtape; Rapper and band approve of the mixtape released by Mick Boogie and Terry Urban\\", MTV, 30 October 2008 He released \\"Southerngold\\" in 2009 which mixed Santigold with music by contemporary southern rappers.

In his early years, Urban was interested in art and began to paint graffiti. However, his music career as a DJ began to flourish and his painting took a back seat. Musically, Urban's DJ career has spanned over a decade but he was looking for a more creative outlet in life. In 2015, with advice from a close friend, Urban began to paint once again. Over the past years, Urban has completely immersed himself into his work and has exhibited his paintings in many solo shows.

It is considered to be one of Denmark's finest Rococo buildings.Damsholte Kirke - historie og arkitektur. In Danish. Retrieved 12 January 2010. History Damsholte Church in 1932k Damsholte Church, with its pale yellow Rococo facade, is unlike any other parish church in Denmark. Its origins, which are comparatively recent, are also unusual. At the beginning of the 18th century, the population of Damsholte and its surroundings had grown so much that there was a real need for a local church. That, at any rate, was the opinion of Provost Jæger in nearby Stege. It is said that at a sumptuous reception in honour of a royal visit by Christian VI, he convinced the king that Damsholte should become a parish in its own right. There is no historical record of the incident but, in any event, in 1740 there was a royal decree that the western part of Stege parish should be separated off. The king contributed 3,000 rigsdaler to the cost of building the church. Each of the other churches on Møn contributed 1,000 rigsdaler while all the other churches in Denmark contributed 1 rigsdaler each.Damsholte Church. From InsulaMoenia.dk. Retrieved 13 January 2010. Designed by Philip de Lange, one of the most prominent architects of the day, the church was completed in 1743. A finely proportioned Rococo church thus came into being in the midst of West Møn's pleasant rolling farmland, the only one of its kind in a Danish village. Architecture and furnishings The interior in 2018 The church consists of a rectangular nave with two pentagonal extensions to east and west. White pilasters decorate each of the corners. Christian VI's monogram can be seen in the triangular gables topping the outer walls of the nave.Damsholte kirke. From NordensKirker.dk. In Danish. Retrieved 13 January 2010. The west door and all the windows have rounded arches. The red-tiled roof is divided into three main sections covering the nave and the extensions. At the western end of the building, it is crowned with an octagonal lantern and onion spire. The bright, yellow-tinted exterior with its onion spire is impressive enough. But those entering the double doors and proceeding through the small inner porch are struck by the rather sombre, well-ordered interior with its pious restraint and dominant altarpiece. Monumental pillars supporting the gallery stretch down either side of the nave to the lofty altar with its integrated pulpit, set high above the triptych. All built of wood, they are painted in subdued tones of grey.Damsholte Kirke - en rokokoperle på Møn. Damsholte menighedsråd. Damsholte, 2004. 16 pp. Altarpiece painting of Christ on the cross (1993) by Sven Havsteen-Mikkelsen The austerity of Lutheran pietism is ubiquitous. The short benches are designed to keep their occupants awake. And a modern triptych of Jesus' crucifixion with the two robbers on either side decorates the altar. It was completed in 1993 by Sven Havsteen-Mikkelsen. On the northern wall, there is a picture of Christ by Eckersberg (1825) while a recently restored figure of Christ occupies a small niche. To one side, a memorial plaque honours those who fell in the war of 1864. On the south wall, there is a picture of the resurrection by Niels Skovgaard together with a portrait of Damsholte's first pastor, Rasmus Platou. The altar with integrated pulpit Hanging in the nave, a faithful copy of the warship Prince Christian commemorates the part it played in the Battle of Zealand Point in March 1808. The two brass candlesticks on the altar were donated at the church's consecration. The wrought iron altar rails display the monograms of Christian VI and Sophia Magdalen. The font, surprisingly enough, is made of wood complete with wooden cover. Despite its austerity, the church bears a clear resemblance to the theatres of the day. The stage is set around the altar with the high-flying pulpit. And the audience is accommodated on the floor of the nave as well as up in the gallery, exactly as in contemporary auditoriums. There is therefore a clear contrast between Damsholte Church and many other churches in Denmark with the severe tones of its theatrical backdrop and the interior's dark, monumental elegance. Churchyard In the churchyard, there is a burial mound for the Tutein family which, for a time, lived in Marienborg Manor which stands behind it. To the north óf the church, a burial vault houses the remains of Antoine de la Calmette, who was governor of Møn and Nykøbing, and his wife Lisa Iselin, for whom he created Liselund, a park adjacent to Møns Klint at the eastern end of the island.

Oaks announced a decision by the Board of Trustees to construct a new campus management building that would be named in honor of N. Eldon Tanner, a Canadian politician and counselor to four presidents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Administrators say that the business school's main building was named after Tanner because he was known in Canada as \\"Mr. Integrity\\" — a title wished upon every Marriott School graduate. The Tanner Building was completed in late 1982 and dedicated on April 5, 1983, by Gordon B. Hinckley.

Born in Ballymena, County Antrim, Ireland, he was the older of the two sons of Sir Robert Shafto Adair, 1st Baronet, and his first wife Elizabeth Maria Strode. He married Theodosia Meade in 1836; they had no children. Adair first stood for election to Parliament in April 1843, when he was the runner-up at a by- election for the Eastern division of Suffolk. He was unsuccessful again at a by-election for the borough of Cambridge in July 1845,Craig, op. cit., pages 76–77 but at the 1847 general election he was elected as one of Cambridge's two MPs. He was defeated at the 1852 general election, but that result was overturned on petition and he was returned to the House of Commons at the resulting by-election in August 1854. He was unseated again in 1857 general election, and, at the 1859 general election, again unsuccessfully contested East Suffolk. He stood again one more time, in Canterbury at the 1865 general election, but did not win a seat.Craig, op. cit., page 79 He was appointed High Sheriff of Antrim in 1853. A Fellow of the Royal Society, he succeeded to the baronetcy in 1869, on the death of his father. He was ennobled on 10 April 1873, as Baron Waveney, of South Elmham in the County of Suffolk. He was Provincial Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of England Masonic province of Suffolk at the time of his death. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Antrim from 1884 until his death in 1886, aged 74, when the peerage became extinct and he was succeeded in the baronetcy by his younger brother Hugh (1815–1902), who had been MP for Ipswich from 1847 to 1874.  Ballymena  The Adair family owned extensive estates in Ballymena, and have been described as the \\"founding fathers\\" of the town. The town is built on land given to the Adair family by King Charles 1 in 1626, on the provision that the town holds two annual fairs and a free Saturday market in perpetuity. In 1865 Adair began the construction in the demesne of Ballymena Castle, a substantial family residence in the Scottish baronial style. The castle was not completed until 1887, and was demolished in 1957 after having lain empty for some years and being vandalised; the site is now a car park. In 1870, Adair donated The People's Park to Ballymena, engaging fifty labourers to work for six months landscaping it.

As a young teenager, Matossian commenced over a decade of training in classical voice. After graduating from the University of British Columbia in 1995, she spent seven years as a high school instructor of English Literature and Language Arts, in addition to time as a counsellor. In 1998 she became the first family member to travel to Armenia since her grandmother, a survivor of the Armenian Genocide, had been deported c. 1915. While there, volunteering for an English-language newspaper, Matossian became informed of the overwhelming plight of Armenian street children. Her involvement with these children culminated in a 2002 leave of absence from her teaching career to work for three months with them. Musical career Matossian’s return from Armenia marked the beginning of her professional career as a musician. 2004 saw Matossian awarded with a Music/Career Development grant from the Canada Council for the Arts, providing her the means to release her debut recording, Far from Home, early the same year. Far from Home has enjoyed airplay across Canada, in the United States and Europe, and was selected in 2005 as one of John Diliberto’s 25 Essential Albums for Echoes radio program on NPR. Matossian’s concerts have been recorded by the CBC and broadcast nationally across Canada. She has performed with the renowned oud master (Udi), John Berberian.

Münster: LIT, 2005. p. 383 Background to the split Between 1924 and 1926 Saxony had been ruled by a coalition of SPD and two liberal parties. The coalition government became unpopular amongst the SPD ranks, and the grassroots of the party revolted against the government participation. The leftist sector of the Saxony SPD preferred a coalition of the SPD and the Communist Party of Germany. The SPD conference in Saxony in 1924 had called for the cooperation with the state government to be terminated, but a significant number of deputies in the Landtag disobeyed the decision. From November 1924 onwards, the dissident deputies were expelled from the party and responded by forming a party of their own, the 'Old Social Democratic Party'. The Old Social Democratic Party issued a press release in April 1926, stating the programmatic goals of the party. The party was formally constituted on June 6, 1926.Lapp, Benjamin. Revolution from the Right: Politics, Class, and the Rise of Nazism in Saxony, 1919 - 1933. Boston: Humanities Press, 1997. pp. 111-112Barclay, David E., and Eric D. Weitz.

New York: Berghahn, 2002. p. 303 The dispute between the leftwing of SPD and the rightist parliamentarian wing (which formed the 'Old Social Democratic Party') in Saxony was labelled the Sachsenkonflikt.Lapp, Benjamin. A 'National' Socialism: The Old Socialist Party of Saxony, 1926-32, in Journal of Contemporary History, Vol. 30, No. 2 (Apr., 1995), pp. 291-309 In the summer of 1926 all members of the Old Social Democratic Party were purged from the SPD mass organizations, such as the Socialist Workers Youth. The party started a newspaper of their own, Der Volkstaat.Lapp, Benjamin. Revolution from the Right: Politics, Class, and the Rise of Nazism in Saxony, 1919 - 1933. Boston: Humanities Press, 1997. p. 119 Drift towards nationalism The 'Old Social Democratic Party' expressed a shift in ideological discourse. Soon after the foundation of the party, it began redefining itself, from viewing itself as the moderate wing of the German Social Democracy to a 'proletarian nationalist' ideological position (in contrast to the 'internationalist' and 'anti-state' SPD).Lapp, Benjamin. Revolution from the Right: Politics, Class, and the Rise of Nazism in Saxony, 1919 - 1933. Boston: Humanities Press, 1997. p. 120Lapp, Benjamin. Revolution from the Right: Politics, Class, and the Rise of Nazism in Saxony, 1919 - 1933. Boston: Humanities Press, 1997. pp. 124-125 The Volkstaat editor Ernst Niekisch (later a prominent National Bolshevik), whose influence within the party grew, was the architect of this process. Niekisch's national revolutionary line was supported by Heldt, but others in the party leadership (Wilhelm Buck and Karl Bethke) opposed it. The party was labelled as 'social fascist' by the communist press.Lönne, Karl-Egon. Il fascismo come provocazione: \\"Rote Fahne\\" e \\"Vorwärts\\" a confronto con il fascismo italiano tra il 1920 e il 1933. Napoli: Guida Editori, 1985. p. 143 Possibly, this was the first time this term was used in communist discourse. The party was joined by August Winnig (former president of East Prussia), who had been expelled from the SPD for involvement in the Kapp Putsch. Through the recruitment of Winnig, the party hoped to expand its influence to other parts of Germany. 1926 election Ahead of the October 1926 Saxony Landtag election, the party received a significant support amongst trade unionists in eastern Saxony (Dresden-Bautzen), which had been the stronghold of the SPD rightwing before the split. The party got 4.2% of the votes in Saxony, and won four seats in the assembly. The party continued to form part of the coalition government until the elections of 1929. In the fall of 1927 the paramilitary organization Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold expelled all members belonging to the Old Social Democratic Party, accusing the party of seeking alliances with fascists. At this stage the party began distancing itself from its bourgeois coalition partners, criticizing them from a nationalist angle. It began seeking cooperation with nationalist groups, such as Der Stahlhelm and Junge Deutsche Orden. The National Socialist German Workers' Party newspaper Völkischer Beobachter began writing positively about the positions of the Old Social Democratic Party. However, Völkischer Beobachter expressed concerns regarding the name of the party (which sought to identify with the Marxist roots of the SPD) and the position of the Old Social Democratic Party towards the Jewish population (which the National Socialists found too vague). 1928, 1929 and 1930 elections The new, 'national revolutionary' profile proved to be a non- starter for the electoral work of the party. For example, Niekisch's national revolutionary line had alienated the trade unionists in the textile industry, whom initially had supported the party. With their departure from the party, it lost whatever influence in the labour movement it once had. The party got 65,573 votes in the 1928 Reichtag election, but no seats.Labour and Socialist International. Kongress-Protokolle der Sozialistischen Arbeiter-Internationale - B. 3.1 Brüssel 1928. Glashütten im Taunus: D. Auvermann, 1974. p. IV. 41 35,000 of the votes had come from Saxony. After the election a new party programme was adopted, without any of the 'national revolutionary' references. After the 1929 Landtag election in Saxony, the NSDAP demanded that the party (and the German Democratic Party) be excluded from the government. Wilhelm Bünger complied with this demand and left the Old Social Democratic Party out of the governing coalition. However, this decision was soon reverted and the Old Social Democratic Party politician Georg Elsner was reinstated as Minister of Employment and Welfare.Szejnmann, Claus-Christian W. Nazism in Central Germany: The Brownshirts in 'red' Saxony. Monographs in German history, v. 4. New York: Berghahn Books, 1999. pp. 18-19 The party failed to win any seat in the 1930 Saxony Landtag election. Disbanding The party disintegrated in the early 1930s. The radical nationalists of the party joined the NSDAP. The remains of the party, people from the party who had not fully renounced Marxism, merged back into the SPD in July 1932.Szejnmann, Claus-Christian W.

He was eligible for the 2009 NHL Entry Draft and 2010 NHL Entry Draft, but went undrafted, being drafted 185th overall in the 2010 KHL Junior Draft by SKA St. Petersburg instead. Playing career Benjamin started his career in the 2007–08 with the Swiss U20 team, which competed in the Swiss League (SL). After moderate showing in the SL, he signed his first professional contract with Genève-Servette HC of the National League (NL). He posted a 2.50 GAA in 21 games played with Servette. For the 2009–2010 season, he was on loan to the SCL Tigers, also in the NL, located in Langnau im Emmental. He was ranked as the fourth best international goaltender by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau in 2010, and entered into the 2010 NHL Entry Draft but he still went undrafted. TSN's hockey analysts Pierre McGuire and Gord Miller both compared Conz favourably to Conn Smythe winner and Stanley Cup champion Jean-Sébastien Giguère. On June 21, 2017, Conz was shipped to HC Ambrì-Piotta despite one year remaining on his contract with Fribourg. He was signed to a one-year contract by Ambri with an option for a second year. Ambri-Piotta exercised his option on February 1, 2018. On November 11, 2018, Conz was signed to an early two-year contract extension by Ambri-Piotta through the 2020/21 season. With a nagging hip injury following the 2018-19 season, Conz had to undergo surgery on May 20, 2019. He was sidelined for 5 months and returned to game action on October 27, 2019 on a rehab assignment with the HCB Ticino Rockets of the Swiss League. He eventually returned to play with Ambri-Piotta but sustained an adductor injury on December 8, 2019, forcing him to sit out a month of competition, including the 2019 Spengler Cup in which Ambri-Piotta was invited. International play At the 2010 IIHF World U20 Championships, Conz led the Swiss team to impressive fourth place finish. He managed an upset of the Slovaks by stopping 39 shots in a 4–1 victory. This victory advanced Switzerland to the knockout round to face the highly favoured Russian squad. Against the Russian, Conz had another impressive match where he made 50 saves on 52 shots, as the Swiss advanced 3–2. After losing to the Canadians 6–1 and Swedes 11–4 and out of the medals, Conz finished the tournament with a 4.76 GAA and an 89.31% save percentage, an impressive feat due to the workload the over-matched Swiss defence allowed on Conz. He faced more than 300 shots on goal, making him the tournament's busiest goalie, and his 284 saves in seven games were tournament best. Despite allowing the second most goals in the tournament at 34, he was selected to the tournament all-star team and named the best goaltender.

Facts *Ann Harnett collaborated with famed poster artist Otis Shepard to design special baseball uniforms for the League. The one-piece short-skirted flared tunic was fashioned after the figure skating, field hockey, and tennis costumes of the period. Satin shorts, knee-high baseball socks and baseball hat completed the uniform. Each city had a different colored uniform and its own symbolic patch decorated the front of the uniform. Harnett also became a model for the innovator uniforms.League History. All- American Girls Professional Baseball League.

While the film does not use real names, filmmaker Penny Marshall seemed to be aiming for realism, as her film includes fake newsreel footage and pseudo-documentary present day scenes at the beginning and end of the fictitious story. Like many of her colleagues, Harnett, was relatively unknown until the Marshall's film was exhibited for the first time.

He justified the American Revolution in excusing Americans in their resistance to the demands of England, and he was an advocate of progressive political liberty. Life The brother of Thomas Belsham, and brother-in-law of the Unitarian minister Timothy Kenrick, he was born at Bedford, the son of James Belsham (died 1770), a nonconformist minister. He died near Hammersmith 17 November 1827. Works Belsham wrote history as a radical Whig. He belonged to the anti-war group of historians, with Charles James Fox and Anthony Robinson. He began his career as an author by publishing Essays, Philosophical, Historical, and Literary, two vols. 1789–91. He used the term \\"libertarian\\" in a discussion of free will and in opposition to \\"necessitarian\\" (or determinist) views. In 1792 he published Examination of an Appeal from the Old to the New Whigs, and in 1793 Remarks on the Nature and Necessity of Political Reform. He also wrote on the Test Act, the French Revolution, the Treaty of Amiens, and the poor laws. In 1793 Belsham published, in two volumes, Memoirs of the Kings of Great Britain of the House of Brunswick-Luneburg, and this was followed in 1795 by Memoirs of the Reign of George III to the Session of Parliament 1793, in four volumes, a fifth and sixth volume appearing in 1801, bringing it down to 1799. In 1798 he published, in two volumes, A History of Great Britain from the Revolution to the Accession of the House of Hanover, and in 1806 all the volumes were reissued, with two additional volumes, the twelve volumes appearing under the title, History of Great Britain to the Conclusion of the Peace of Amiens in 1802. He engaged in controversy with Herbert Marsh on the responsibility for the French Revolutionary Wars, taking the Foxite Whig line and supporting German critics of Great Britain. An eight-volume set Memoirs of the Reign of George III from his Accession, to the Peace of Amiens was published in 1813.

The Institute provides services for children with developmental concerns mild to severe, and is involved in research into various disorders, including new interventions and earlier diagnosis. History and mission Kennedy Krieger Institute opened its doors in 1937 when Winthrop Phelps, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon from Baltimore, responded to a dire need for treatment for individuals with cerebral palsy. Dr. Phelps founded the Children's Rehabilitation Institute, the first treatment facility in the country dedicated solely to children with cerebral palsy. The institute was renamed the Kennedy Institute in 1968 in memory of President John F. Kennedy who enacted the Medical Training Act during his administration, to protect the rights and improve the lives of persons with disabilities. In 1992, the name was changed again to Kennedy Krieger to honor original board member and long-time supporter, Zanvyl Krieger. Since it opened, Kennedy Krieger Institute has evolved into an international resource for children with diverse brain-related disorders, from mild learning disabilities to rare genetic disorders. Kennedy Krieger provides medical care and schooling, in addition to its involvement in research. Core areas of focus=Patient care Kennedy Krieger treats more than 19,000 children annually. The Institute practices early identification, intervention, and treatment of disabilities to maximize potential and to prevent major problems throughout a child's life. Kennedy Krieger brings all the disciplines to bear-science, medicine, therapy- on the problems and injuries that affect a child's development. The institute's interdisciplinary approach brings together a team of professionals from various fields and departments to create treatment plans tailored to the special needs of each child throughout all stages of care. Research Kennedy Krieger scientists research to prevent and cure pediatric neurological disorders, spinal cord injuries and developmental disabilities. The institute's work has yielded answers that are improving the treatment and care of children with conditions such as autism, cerebral palsy and spina bifida. A team of international scientists and investigators at Kennedy Krieger is working to isolate culprit genes and develop new treatment models and therapies. The institute has a swift transfer of research to patient care. The institute received a $1.5 million grant in early 2010 to perform brain cancer research. Special education The Kennedy Krieger School is a nationally recognized Blue Ribbon School of Excellence and a leader in providing model programs of innovative education for children ages 6 to 21 with a wide range of learning, emotional, physical, neurological and developmental disabilities. Education occurs in a variety of day-school settings and in partnership settings within public schools. The goal of Kennedy Krieger Institute's Department of Special Education is to provide a number of special education and related services to children with disabilities in a variety of school-based, hospital-based and recreational settings. Community programs At Kennedy Krieger, the faculty and staff advance the treatment of developmental disabilities only by sharing knowledge with individuals and organizations throughout the local communities, across the country, and around the world. In order to help all individuals with developmental disabilities achieve their full potential, Kennedy Krieger works to increase the community's knowledge and understanding. The cornerstone of these efforts is the Maryland Center for Developmental Disabilities at Kennedy Krieger Institute. The Center focuses on professional training, community service, research, and information dissemination. Professional training In addition to the other core areas of focus, Kennedy Krieger also provides training opportunities to increase the number of qualified specialists in the field of neurological and developmental disabilities. Each year, more than 400 individuals come to Kennedy Krieger to train with renowned experts in many fields from audiology to pediatrics, and nursing to occupational and physical therapy. The institute also funds the training of the next generation of researchers. Scientific breakthroughs=Adrenoleukodystrophy Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare genetic disorder of the brain that occurs only in males. The fatal condition destroys the nervous system, often leaving the victim unable to walk, and talk normally. For many years ALD took the lives of many and continues to do so today. In 1987, Augusto and Michaela Odone, parents of a child affected by ALD, invented Lorenzo's oil as a treatment for the disease. Their story was in the 1992 Universal Studios motion picture, Lorenzo's Oil, starring Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon. Dr. Hugo Moser, a renowned scientist at Kennedy Krieger Institute, joined forces with the Odone's, ultimately proving that their treatment, Lorenzo's oil, can prevent the onset of ALD if begun before neurological symptoms appear. Moser and colleagues also created the first diagnostic test for ALD, as well as a newborn screening test that can detect the disease from birth. On January 20, 2007 Dr. Hugo Moser died of complications from surgery to treat pancreatic cancer. Today, Dr. Moser's wife Ann B. Moser, continues this important work at Kennedy Krieger. In 2008, she helped to launch a pilot study to screen for ALD in 5000 newborns born in local Baltimore hospitals, the results of which will be used to advocate for nationwide newborn screening for this devastating disorder. Autism Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a large focus of the institute's research and clinical programs. Autism is typically diagnosed by age three, however the institute's research is focused on detecting signs of the disorder even earlier. One of the pioneers of autism research today is Dr. Rebecca Landa, Director of the Center for Autism & Related Disorders at Kennedy Krieger. Landa has discovered that some babies begin to show risk factors for autism as early as 14 months of age. Her work also focuses on developing early intervention models for toddlers with autism that help to improve a child's social, language, and cognitive skills. The institute's expertise in the diagnose and treatment of autism is nationally recognized and its president, Gary Goldstein, is an oft-cited authority. Kennedy Krieger runs the Interactive Autism Network, an online national autism registry, launched in 2007.\\"Previous studies looking at a narrower population of youngsters have suggested that as much as 40% of the rise in autism cases might be explained by broader diagnostic definitions and by heightened awareness of the condition. But that still leaves 60% of the increase unaccounted for. \\"Most scientists believe there is something more than just awareness and a broadening definition that is responsible for the rise,\\" says Dr. Gary Goldstein, president of the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore. 'We are seeing some fraction of the increase that is probably due to more cases of autism.'\\" Spinal cord injury Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes damage to nerve roots and fibers that carry messages to and from the brain. Spinal cord injuries can result from physical trauma, tumors, developmental disorders or a number of different diseases. In 1995, Christopher Reeve, known for his role in all three Superman movies, was thrown from his horse and landed headfirst into a fence shattering his first and second vertebrae. Reeve's cervical spinal injury paralyzed him from the neck down. Reeve sought the aid of Dr. John McDonald, who was working at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. After extensive activity-based therapies, Reeve was able to wiggle his toes and move a couple of fingers. Christopher Reeve died in 2004, however his achievements shined light on everyone affected by spinal cord injuries. Dr. McDonald left St. Louis and officially opened the International Center for Spinal Cord Injury (ICSCI) at Kennedy Krieger Institute on June 14, 2005. ICSCI is one of the first centers to have a focus specifically on children with chronic spinal cord injuries and paralysis. The center utilizes innovative activity-based therapies such as FES cycling, aquatic therapy, and partial weight supported walking to help patients regain sensation and feeling in their bodies. The center combines clinical research with a focus on restoration and rehabilitation for children and adults with chronic paralysis. *International Center for Spinal Cord Injury Schooling/special education *Kennedy Krieger Lower/Middle School The Kennedy Krieger Lower/Middle School located at the Fairmount campus in Baltimore serves students in grades pre-K through 8. The school's preschool is a full day program focusing on the core deficits of autism for children ages 3–5. Students in the elementary and middle grades are carefully grouped for instruction that is aligned with national standards and guided by the Maryland College and Career Readiness Standards. *Kennedy Krieger High School (KKHS) The Kennedy Krieger High School is a special education day program on the Greenspring campus in Baltimore, serving more than 200 students aged 14–21. The children come from many Maryland school districts, the District of Columbia and from neighboring states to enroll in either 10 or 11 month programs. Industry training and work-based learning is emphasized for all students, who can graduate with either a Maryland high school diploma or a certificate of completion. *Kennedy Krieger School LEAP Program The Kennedy Krieger School LEAP Program (Life skills and Education for Students with Autism and other Pervasive Behavioral Challenges) serves students with severe autism in a 12-month day program. LEAP consists of 65 students in 10 different classrooms and it has a supportive 1:1 staff to student ratio. *Montgomery County campus The Montgomery County campus of Kennedy Krieger School opened in 2007 and primarily serves students with autism spectrum disorders. Students in grades 3-8 are on a high school diploma track, while students aged 11–21 can work towards a certificate of completion.

Although it is first attested in 342/345, its creation must date to ca. 318, under Emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306–337). The comes was the successor of the Principate-era rationalis, and supervised those financial sectors that were left outside the purview of the praetorian prefects: the taxation of senators, the chrysargyron tax, customs duties, mines, mints and state-run mills and textile factories. Initially, the comes also controlled the emperor's private domains, but these passed under the control of the comes rerum privatarum by the end of the 4th century. He also exercised some judicial functions related to taxation in his administrative courts in particular in matters of fiscal debt. The office of the comes gradually declined in importance after the late 5th century, especially after Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491–518) abolished the hated chrysargyron. He remained however one of the main fiscal ministers, controlling an array of bureaux (scrinia) and with an extensive staff detached to the provinces. The last comes known is mentioned under the Emperor Phocas (r. 602–610). He was succeeded by the sakellarios and the logothetes tou genikou, who remained the chief fiscal ministers in the middle Byzantine period (7th–11th centuries).

The earliest known fossils are from the Pliocene of Argentina. Taxonomy Abrotrichines were universally placed in the tribe Akodontini until the 1990s, and some were even classified within the genus Akodon. Allozyme studies in the early 1990s first provided evidence for their distinction from Akodontini, and in 1999 a study analyzing sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene found further evidence for the distinction between Akodontini and this group and proposed the name Abrotrichini for the latter.Smith and Patton, 1999, p. 106 The name Abrotrichini remained formally unavailable under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, however, because their proposal had been conditional.Smith and Patton, 1999, p. 106: \\"An appropriate name for the new tribe would be Abrotrichini\\"; D'Elía et al., 2007, p. 190 Thus, the clade remained without a valid name and for this reason it was included in Akodontini in the 2005 third edition of Mammal Species of the World. Other phylogenetic studies, which also incorporated nuclear genes, affirmed the distinction between Akodontini and the new group.D'Elía, 2003, fig. 1; D'Elía et al., 2003, fig. 2; D'Elía et al., 2006, figs. 1, 2 In 2007, Guillermo D'Elía and coworkers published a full diagnosis of the tribe Abrotrichini, validating the name. Abrotrichini includes four genera—Abrothrix, Chelemys, Geoxus, and Notiomys—which fall into two major subgroups, one including only Abrothrix and one including the four other genera.D'Elía et al., 2007, p. 190 Abrothrix has formerly been included in Akodon and includes about nine species, among which are the northernmost abrotrichine, Abrothrix jelskii as well as far southern forms such as Abrothrix lanosus.Musser and Carleton, 2005, pp. 1088–1091 Within the remaining group, Chelemys is sister to the remaining genera; it includes three species found in central and southern Chile and nearby Argentina.Musser and Carleton, 2005, pp. 1109–1110 The remaining three genera, each of which includes a single species, are closely related and share fossorial (digging) habits. Geoxus occurs in central and southern Chile and nearby Argentina,Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 1116 and Notiomys in southern Argentina,Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 1136 The tribe is part of the clade Oryzomyalia, which includes most of the subfamily Sigmodontinae.D'Elía et al., 2006, fig. 1 Within Oryzomyalia, some studies have recovered Wiedomys as the closest relative of Abrotrichini,Smith and Patton, 1999, figs. 4, 5; D'Elía et al., 2006, fig. 1 but the basal relationships among the components of Oryzomyalia remain elusive.D'Elía et al., 2006, p. 563 Sigmodontinae encompasses hundreds of species found throughout South America and into North America. It is one of several subfamilies recognized in the family Cricetidae, which includes many more species, mainly from Eurasia and North America. Description Abrotrichines are small to medium-sized sigmodontine rodents with long and soft, usually gray or brown fur, a short, hairy tail and large, strong feet with well-developed claws. In the skull, the snout is long, the interorbital region hourglass-shaped, and the braincase rounded. The palate is long (extending back beyond the third molars). There are no grooves in the upper incisors and the molars are not hypsodont (high-crowned). The molars lack many accessory features, in particularly the third upper molar. There are 13 thoracic (chest) vertebrae with associated ribs, 6 lumbar vertebrae, and 18 to 29 caudal (tail) vertebrae. A karyotype of 52 chromosomes (2n = 52), present in several species, has been suggested as a synapomorphy of the tribe,Smith and Patton, 1999, p. 105 but while this possibility is yet to be tested, Pearsonomys is now known to have 2n = 56 and some Abrothrix olivaceus have 2n = 44.

Fights among puukkojunkkaris were common, and often resulted in homicide; one could even get stabbed at a funeral. Puukkojunkkaris usually made trouble at weddings, stole horses and circulated among towns and villages. They also participated in gambling, thievery and courtship with women. The most notorious puukkojunkkaris lived in towns near the Lapuanjoki river, such as Alahärmä. The first homicides happened in the 1790s, but the famous \\"golden age\\" of puukkojunkkaris lasted from the 1820s to the 1880s. Puukkojunkkaris as social phenomenon Puukkojunkkaris were present in all society classes. They included both free houseowners and farm servants. The houseowners were often gang leaders. Puukkojunkkaris were often feared and respected, and fought for their honour. The code of honour disallowed fear and respected fighting. Puukkojunkkaris were often difficult to prosecute because few people dared testify against them. Puukkojunkkaris also received admiration and respect because they dared to stand up against society and authorities. Paulaharju 1947, p. 284–305, Pietiläinen 1999, p. 303–316, Kallio 1982, p. 256-263, Kallio 2009, p. 9, 154–167,186. Many attempts have been made to explain the rise of puukkojunkkaris. In the 19th century, the living standard in Ostrobothnia rose, and because of this, weddings became grandiose events with many alcoholic beverages. Young men in Ostrobothnia did not often get a chance to inherit their own farm in their home town and earn their own wealth, which led to frustration.Ylikangas 1976, p. 289-294. Theory of young men’s rebellion Reino Kallio's theory of knife-fighters is based on the idea of a counter reaction caused by social control that has been taken too far. He sees youth's violent behaviour as a protest-like rebellion against the pressure exercised by the power structure; particularly against local laws and parish discipline. The resistance that started as little more than slight mischief became branded as troublemakers and led to a path towards serious crimes. This was particularly due to the fact that parish discipline, which was stricter than general law, lowered the threshold of crime. At the time, there were many new ways of youngsters spending their free time, such as wandering around outdoors at night, which was considered a breach against the curfew and a threat to the existence of class society. Therefore, district courts started punishing people for curfew at night – as well as for other breakages against parish discipline.Kallio 1982, p. 234-239, Rajala 2004, p. 28-29, Kallio 2009, p. 154-156. The fundamentalist church and religious revivalist movements in the 18th and 19th centuries, such as pietism, also had a negative view towards young people's leisure activities due to moral reasons. This led to competition between different religious groups, first leading to tighter church discipline and then to parish discipline. The situation was brought to a head by the labour shortage due to tar and peatland burning cultivation that brought more tension to the working conditions, while the rich, house-owning population competed with each other, building baronial, 1.5 to 2-storey-high residential buildings. By invoking general regulations, masters could avoid disciplinary conflicts with their children or hirelings when there was labour shortage. Furthermore, increased drinking caused both problems to families and conflicts inside communities. The disciplinary regulations that were normally confirmed by the governor limited and regulated in detail the already scarce free time that youngsters had: in addition to curfew at night, the celebration of dances, the publication of the bans of marriage and weddings, gatecrashing, moving, gathering, the use of spirits, cardplaying as well as general noisemaking and loitering. Because the young age groups usually took care of the heaviest physical work, conditional fines were introduced in the 19th century to prevent days off. In Lapua, Laihia and Mustasaari, not only farmhands, but also house-owners and crofters were banned from having free days. At worst, parish discipline even led to group criminalisation of young people, as was the case in Kauhava and Vähäkyrö in the 1770s and 1780s, in Vöyri in the 1820s and 1830s, and in the greater parishes of Laihia and Lapua a couple of decades later. Parish discipline was implemented as group punishments, and they were only taken to court in certain parishes in southern Ostrobothnia, not elsewhere in Finland – except for a few possible exceptions. All in all, troublemaking was based on the background of a long-term crisis caused by a radical socio-economic change, which triggered youth violence due to the parish discipline managed and maintained by authorities. Finally, the emerged culture of violence also started feeding itself. The model that Mr. Kallio used for the first time in his thesis in 1982 has also been called the youth rebellion theory. Its main sources include court minutes and document material from local archives. The theory approaches the stigmatisation theory that the internationally known sociologist, Mr. Anthony Giddens, considers to be one of the most important criminal theories. According to this theory, criminal behaviour is not a characteristic of an individual or a group, but rather an interactive process between criminals and non-criminals. The theory is based on the concept that no deed is criminal in itself, but the definition of crime constitutes a part of the exercise of power. An individual stigmatised as criminal is discriminated by authorities, which supports criminal behaviour and displacement from the mainstream population. A similar view can indirectly also be seen in the drama Pohjalaisia (Ostrobothnians). Execution of parish laws and regulations In the central parishes of both Finnish and Swedish-speaking southern Ostrobothnia, those who defended parish laws and regulations particularly directed their aims for power towards young working population, such as house- owners’, crofters’ and independent workers’ children, as well as soldiers and servants, who were in a socially subordinate position. Hundreds of them were fined for violations against parish discipline during the last three decades under the Swedish reign, so it was at the same time the first large-scale youth problem in the Finnish society that we know of. On the local level, order was maintained by masters and, as trustees, mainly village aldermen and lay members of the courts, whose duty was to inform authorities of any violations against rules. Aldermen were sometimes even fined for neglecting their order maintaining duties. Many rural police chiefs also aimed at catching those guilty of violations against general order, and taking them to court. In the worst cases of public disorder, rural police chiefs had to call Russian armed forces, i.e. Cossacks, for help – one of them was even killed at a wedding in Lapua in 1862. Maintenance of order, and repetitive criminalisation after that, led to their displacement from the community. As a result, some of them considered themselves criminals, acted accordingly and even boasted of their criminal “heroic deeds”, which were sometimes also directed at rural police chiefs, priests and trustees. Santeri Alkio describes disturbances aimed at the last-mentioned group in his novel Puukkojunkkarit (Knife-fighters). Kallio 2009, p. 120-128, 141-146, 154-167, 173-175.

Virgin Mary In the early 1920s, the French architect Ernest Hébrard began his urban plan to redesign the city of Hanoi, as a part of this plan, a new Roman Catholic church named Church of Martyrs was built in front of the Northern Gate (Cửa Bắc) of the ancient Hanoi Citadel in 1932. Because of its location, the church was more commonly known as Cua Bac Church. Ernest Hébrard designed Cua Bac Church in eclectic style with strong influence of Art Deco decoration, he also integrated in the Catholic Church some elements of the traditional architecture in Vietnam such as the system of roof tiles and the harmony between the main architecture with its surrounding green space. For that reason, Cua Bac Church is considered a fine example for the mixed style between European and Vietnamese architectures. Originally planned to be named Vietnamese Martyrs, the title of the church was changed to Queen of Martyrs because at that time, the Vietnamese Martyrs was not yet canonized. In 1959, the Apostolic Vicar Joseph-Marie Trịnh Như Khuê re-titled it as the Church of Our Lady of Hanoi. The feast day of the church's title is July 2, the old date for Visitation. Today, Cua Bac Church is one of the three major churches of Hanoi, together with Ham Long Church and Saint Joseph Cathedral. In November 2006, Cua Bac Church was chosen the venue of a joint congregation of the Vietnamese Catholics and Protestants with participation of the United States President George W.

Although downed behind enemy lines, he evaded capture by donning civilian clothing and covering 40 miles back to his squadron mess. He found his squadron-mates celebrating the Armistice ending the war. He returned to Australia on 6 May 1919. By 18 June, he had been discharged. Francis Ryan Smith is known to have survived until at least 1951, when he is recorded as leasing out an auto service station in Willandra, Australia. Honors and awards Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) Lieut. (A./Capt.) Francis Ryan Smith, M.C. (Australian F.C.). (FRANCE) This officer combines high individual enterprise and determination with exceptionally able leadership. These qualities were conspicuous on 14 October, when, leading a patrol of five machines, he saw a formation of twelve Fokker biplanes above him. Relying on the co-operation of another higher formation of Bristol machines, he, deliberately manoeuvred his formation into a disadvantageous position in order that our higher patrol might be able to attack the enemy while the latter's attention was concentrated upon destroying his, Lt. Smith's, formation. The stratagem was entirely successful, with the result that two enemy machines were destroyed and two others were believed to crash. The Fokkers were then reinforced by eight more machines, and in the ensuing combat Lt. Smith shot down one in flames, his patrol destroying two others. We suffered no casualties.

During his pro career, he split time between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Boston Yanks. However was also a member of the \\"Steagles\\", a team that was the result of a temporary merger between the Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers due to the league-wide manning shortages in 1943 brought on by World War II. Canale's brawny physique earned him the nickname \\"the Walking Billboard\\". Biography Rocco was born in 1917 in Watertown, New York. He was the son of Nicholas and Josephine Marzano Canale. While attending Watertown High School, he joined the football and wrestling teams. He then quickly becoming one of the school's finest athletes. He graduated in 1939 and received a football scholarship to attend Boston College. College football Prior to his professional career, Canale played at the college level while attending Boston College. There he played as an offensive and defensive lineman. His play would go on to earn him All-American and All-East honors. Canale's blocking and tackling abilities were key factors in Boston College's winning 26 of 31 games played during his varsity career. He was a member of the 1941 Sugar Bowl championship team and the 1943 Orange Bowl squad. He was inducted into the Boston College Varsity Club Athletic Hall of Fame in 1993. =Ed McMahon= Ed McMahon, who later became Johnny Carson's sidekick on \\"The Tonight Show\\", met Canale while he was trying out for Boston College's football team. During a scrimmage, McMahon was assigned to play opposite Canale. While McMahon stopped him once, Canale soon afterwards hit him back even harder. This ended any dreams McMahon had of becoming a football player. 'He creamed me,' McMahon once said, 'and I turned in my uniforms. Military service In 1943 Canale was drafted into the Army, temporarily suspending a professional football career. After training at Greensboro, North Carolina, and Miami Beach, Florida, he was assigned to the First Army Air Force Fighter Command Headquarters located at Mitchell Field in Long Island, New York. He was promoted to corporal in 1944. Canale's name is listed on the World War II Honor Roll, which lists the over 1,000 NFL personnel who served in the military during war. The listing of players has been inscribed on a plaque, located at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. Pro football Canale was drafted in 1943 by, Eagles coach, Greasy Neale to play weekend ball with the Eagles. However 1943 saw the Eagles and Steelers merge to form the Steagles. That season, Canale played in seven games, and in the following year, he participated in nine more; his commanding officer was sympathetic to his desire to play pro football, and allowed him to play with the Steagles. Realizing the football talent among them, the First Army Air Force Fighter Command asked Canale play on its team. He played seven games with the Army in 1945 while still playing four professional football games with the Eagles. In 1946, he asked to be traded to the Boston Yanks and played for that team for the rest of his career. Although he decided to return to the Philadelphia Eagles in 1948, an injury ended his football career. Post footballFamily business= After his playing career ended due to an injury, Canale returned home to Watertown to co-manage with his brother, Richard, Canale's Restaurant, the family business. He was the restaurant's president for 30 years. =Watertown Red and Black= Canale coached the Watertown Red & Black football team, the oldest semi-pro football team in the United States, for three seasons. He ended his coaching career with a 23-2 record. In 1981, he received the Old Timers Certificate of Appreciation by the Red and Black Team of Watertown. =Politics= Canale was active in the Republican Party during the 1960s. He was named chairman of the GOP Rally in honor of State GOP Comptroller Candidate John P. Lomenzo. In 1962, he was appointed administrative assistant to Senator Henry A. Wise, aiding the former senator while the New York Legislature was in session. Family Rocco married Eleanor M. Hilden of Boston, Massachusetts, on December 7, 1943. The couple gave birth to two children Marcia Canale-Bracken and Nicholas R. Canale, both of whom still live in Watertown. Scholarship A scholarship was later created by Canale's wife in his name. It provides Jefferson Community College students who are pursuing an associate degree in physical education the financial opportunity they need to some day coach young adults or become professional athletes.

Other names often found for such a device include belt analyzer, crossbelt analyzer and elemental analyzer. This product first found popularity in the cement industry during the 1990s, and today most new cement plants include at least one analyzer, if not two. Cement industry A couple of applications predominate for the bulk material analyzer in cement production. Stockpile management One is known as “stockpile management,” whereby an analyzer located upstream of the pile is able to track the cumulative chemistry of the pile. This allows the operator to direct haul trucks to different sections of the quarry in a way that will result in the final elemental composition of the pile close to target. Raw mix proportioning A second application in cement for the bulk material analyzer is raw mix proportioning. An analyzer placed just upstream of the raw mill can monitor the chemistry of the raw mix and automatically trigger an adjustment in the proportions of the reclaimed stockpile and the correctives. By doing so, the plant is able to reduce the variability in the raw mix, and later on the kiln feed. Consistent kiln feed chemistry in turn leads to lower fuel consumption per ton of clinker produced. Other applications In the 2000s the application of the bulk material analyzer was extended to include minerals. Today, analyzers are found in copper, iron ore, and phosphates, to name a few. One of the advantages of these analyzers is the timeliness of information for the user. Another is the avoidance of physical sampling. Technology The technology most frequently found in bulk material analysis and coal analysis are PFTNA (Pulsed Fast Thermal Neutron Activation), the prompt gamma neutron activation analysis (PGNAA) and Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). PFTNA and PGNAA technology rely on activation of the material on the conveyor belt by neutrons, and the instantaneous emission of gamma rays from nuclei which have absorbed neutrons. Capitalizing on the unique gamma ray spectrum associated with each element, the instrument can perform an analysis each minute on the composite spectrum to determine the overall elemental composition of the material. LIBS operate by focusing the laser onto a small area at the surface of the material forming a plasma plume. When plasma quickly cools down the atomic emission lines of the elements can be observed using optical spectrometer. Based on obtained spectra quantitative chemical analysis of the sample is performed.

It is a late 19th-century Gothic Revival (Neo-Gothic style) church that serves as the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hanoi. The cathedral was named after Joseph, the patron saint of Vietnam. Construction began in 1886, with the architectural style described as resembling Notre Dame de Paris. The church was one of the first structures built by the French colonial government in Indochina when it opened in December 1886. It is the oldest church in Hanoi. The cathedral conducts mass several times during the day. For Sunday evening mass at 6:00 PM, large crowds spill out into the streets. The prayer hymns are broadcast and Catholics who are unable to enter the cathedral congregate in the street and listen to hymns. Geography The cathedral is situated west of Hoàn Kiếm Lake, in a small square within the Old Quarter. Nearby, there are restaurants and small apartment blocks. Centrally located at the end of the Nha Tho (Church) Street and the corner of Pho Nha Chung, the cathedral which is also the headquarters of Archdiocese of Vietnam has control over 480 churches and chapels, and 113 parishes, and serves 400,000 Catholics. The main gate to the cathedral is opened during mass and during the rest of time the entry is only through a side door in the compound wall of the Diocese. From this point to the cathedral is a walk to the side door and then ring a bell to enter the cathedral. History In 1872, the French under Jean Dupuis captured the Hanoi Citadel, before Francis Garnier conquered the rest of the city. A decade passed before the colonist were in full control of Hanoi due to rebel insurgency. Construction of the cathedral most likely started after this time and it was completed in December 1886, a year before the federation of French Indochina was established as part of its colonial empire. It was built by the French missionary and apostolic vicar of West Tonkin Paul-François Puginier who obtained permission from the then colonial French administration. It was built on the abandoned site of Bao Thien Pagoda. This location was part of an \\"administrative center\\" of Tonkin before the French colonial era. In order to facilitate the construction of the church, the ruins of the pagoda—which was built at the time when the city was founded during the Lý Dynasty in the 11th century and had collapsed in 1542 never to be repaired—were cleared. The cathedral was consecrated on December 24, 1886. After the Viet Minh took control of North Vietnam following the Geneva Accords in 1954, the Catholic Church suffered decades of persecution. Priests were arrested, and church property was seized and expropriated. St. Joseph's Cathedral was not spared and it was closed down until Christmas Eve of 1990, when Mass was permitted to be celebrated there again. In 2008, protests related to religious symbols occurred at the lot next to the cathedral. Architecture=Exterior Built with stone slabs and in brick with concrete facing, the façade consists of two towers, square in shape, rising to a height of and each tower fitted with five bells. The cathedral was built in a Gothic Revival (Neo-Gothic) style. The twin bell towers have often drawn comparisons to the ones at Notre Dame de Paris; the architects of St. Joseph's sought to emulate its Parisian counterpart. The exterior walls of the church are made of granite stone slabs. ' Over the years, the cathedral's exterior has become severely worn down due to heavy pollution. ' Interior Windows are fitted with tall stained glass and have pointed arches. The cathedral's stained glass windows were produced in France before being transported to Vietnam. The ceiling is rib vaulted like those seen in medieval Europe. The nave is weathered and the sanctuary looks shiny and is made of gilt trimmed wood, similar to that of Phat Diem Cathedral and has royal Hue architectural embellishments. A statue of Virgin Mary is kept in palanquin according to the local custom, which is seen to the left of the nave. It is at the end of the church street which is an upscale market area with boutiques and silks.

RMMV is part of Rheinmetall's Vehicle Systems Division. Rheinmetall AG holds a 51% stake in RMMV, with the remaining 49% held by MAN Truck & Bus. RMMV is a provider to security and armed forces of a wide range of armoured and unarmoured transport, command and role-specific wheeled vehicles. Company evolution In 2009 the then MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG (now MAN Truck & Bus AG) and Rheinmetall AG announced their respective intentions to form a joint wheeled military vehicles company. The alliance became a legal reality in May 2010. RMMV is essentially the merger of Rheinmetall's wheeled military vehicle activities with those of the military truck activities of MAN. The aim of this merger was to combine the complementary technological core competencies of MAN's automotive expertise in commercial-vehicle manufacture with Rheinmetall's technological know-how in the military land sector/systems field. The result of this merger was the creation of a single-source provider for a wide range of armoured and unarmoured transport, command and role-specific wheeled vehicles. As a first step, the development and sales activities of both companies was transferred to RMMV effective 1 May 2010. The first public appearance of the RMMV was at IDEB 2010 in Bratislava. In October 2010, Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles agreed to cooperate with driveline specialist Timoney Technology. The first example of this partnership is the Wisent. In a second contractually agreed step, by the end of 2011 the relevant production facilities of the partner companies were to be integrated into the joint venture structure, though they were remain at their present locations in Kassel, Germany (Rheinmetall) and Vienna, Austria (MAN). During the first phase, RMMV had approximately 370 employees. Following completion of the second phase, the company's staff steadily increased to its current level of around 1,800. RMMV's headquarters is in Munich. Current subsidiary companies are Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles Österreich GesmbH, Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles Australia and Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles UK. From January 2016 RMMV has operated as part of the wider Rheinmetall Vehicle Systems.

Plot A young American couple is murdered while vacationing in Europe. The young woman’s father, Jacob Kanon, is a New York City police investigator who travels to Europe to hunt down the murderer. Other young couples in France, Germany, Denmark and Sweden have since then been killed and the evidence points in the same direction. Kanon joins up with Scandinavian journalist Dessie Larsson to find the murderer. Kanon and Larsson must work against time since every murder is preceded by a postcard to a regional daily. Publication The book was first published in Sweden in January 2010 and the English language edition was published in August the same year. At the end of August, it reached number one on The New York Times Best Seller List, making Liza Marklund the second Swedish author (the first one being Stieg Larsson with the Millennium series) ever to reach the number one spot. Conception Patterson had read all of Marklund’s books and contacted her asking if the two would write a thriller together. She had not planned to write any novel during 2009 and intended to spend the year studying Spanish. Marklund visited Patterson in his home in Florida where the two discussed ideas and concepts. Patterson later sketched out a foundation synopsis and sent it to her. Marklund went through it, added things she thought were missing and sent it back to Patterson, who in turn added more comments. The creation of this novel included a lot of e-mailing back and forth. Marklund wrote the first draft and Patterson the second draft. Both authors have co-written books in the past, but never across the language barrier. Marklund says she reads English just as fast as Swedish but she wrote in Swedish and then had her drafts translated into English before they were sent to Patterson.http://www.expressen.se/noje/bocker/1.1481928/marklund-och- patterson-i-samarbetehttp://www.piratforlaget.se/nyheter-om-liza- marklund/liza-marklund-om-samarbetet-med-james-patterson  Film adaptation  Patterson told Swedish newspaper Expressen that Hollywood studios had shown an interest in the book. The paper listed Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, United 93) and Gavin O'Connor (Miracle) as possible directors. He also speculated that the fact that Marklund hails from the same nation as Stieg Larsson had fuelled the interest. After several years in development hell, the film adaptation, entitled The Postcard Killings, began production in March 2019, with Danis Tanović directing, and starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Jacob Kanon and Cush Jumbo as Dessie Larsson (renamed Dessie Leonard in the film). Originally, Janusz Kamiński was hired to direct, with Patrick Dempsey as Kanon, and Dakota Fanning and later Britt Robertson as Leonard.

A native of Lavernose, a village near Toulouse, he played as scrum-half and fly-half and is credited to this day by Stade Toulousain as the strategist of the club's first great teams in the early 20th century. Rugby career Unlike most French players of his era, he did not have a professional occupation; he was instead an employee in a business run by his family. Paul Voivenel, who became a prominent rugby administrator and played a major role in keeping Mayssonnié's memory alive, recalled him as \\"a slight, unmuscular figure, an honest workman with the air of a teacher or public servant.\\" Mayssonnié is believed to be the first player to be selected for the France national team while playing for Toulouse. Although he appeared only three times for France, he was nonetheless involved in two historic matches. His first appearance, in 1908 against England, was France's first match at Colombes, which would remain the national team's primary home until the opening of Parc des Princes in the 1970s. His final match in 1910, against Wales, was the first in the Five Nations era (i.e., involving France, England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales) of the competition now known as the Six Nations Championship. He had a more successful career at club level, winning four national championships with three lower-level Toulouse teams in six seasons. (In his day, France held championships at several different levels, with major clubs such as Toulouse fielding teams at multiple levels.) The crowning moment of his club career came in 1912, when he started as fly-half for the Toulouse first team in the championship final against Racing Club de France due to an injury. With Toulouse trailing 6–0 early in the second half, Mayssonnié scored the try that swung the momentum toward Toulouse, which went on to score a second try and win the first of their many titles. Military service and death Mayssonnié volunteered for service once World War I broke out, and was appointed a non-commissioned infantry officer. Within three weeks, he was cited for bravery in an action near Verdun. He died in action at the Battle of the Marne, making him the first of over 100 rugby internationals, including 23 of the 112 pre-war France internationals, to die during World War I. According to rugby historian Huw Richards, \\"His body might, like those of many war victims, have been lost but for his former Toulouse and France team-mate Pierre Mounicq, who buried it while under enemy fire.\\" Two days later, a group of five men that included Voivenel marked his grave; after the war, his remains were exhumed, returned to Lavernose, and reinterred in the local churchyard. He is honored every 11 November, thanks to a stele bearing his image affixed to the monument to the dead Herakles Archer Toulouse.

Chang'e 1's successor, Chang'e 2, was approved on October 2008 and was launched on 1 October 2010 to conduct research from a 100-km-high lunar orbit, in preparation for Chang'e 3's 2013 soft landing. Chang'e 2, though similar in design to Chang'e 1, was equipped with improved instruments and provided higher-resolution imagery of the lunar surface to assist in the planning of the Chang'e 3 mission. In 2012, Chang'e 2 was dispatched on an extended mission to the asteroid 4179 Toutatis. Objectives The official mission objective is to achieve China's first soft-landing and roving exploration on the Moon, as well as to demonstrate and develop key technologies for future missions. The scientific objectives of Chang'e 3 include lunar surface topography and geology survey, lunar surface material composition and resource survey, Sun-Earth-Moon space environment detection, and lunar-based astronomical observation. Chang'e 3 will attempt to perform the first direct measurement of the structure and depth of the lunar soil down to a depth of , and investigate the lunar crust structure down to several hundred meters deep. The Chinese Lunar Exploration Program has been divided into three main operational phases, which are: *Orbiting (Chang'e 1 and Chang'e 2) *Landing (Chang'e 3 and Chang'e 4) *Sample return (Chang'e 5 and Chang'e 6) Mission profile=Launch Chang'e 3 was launched at 17:30 UTC on 1 December 2013 (01:30 local time on 2 December) atop a Long March 3B rocket flying from Launch Complex 2 at the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in the southwestern province of Sichuan.Rocket debris hits Chinese village The Guardian, 4 December 2013. Homes downrange of the Launch Centre were damaged during liftoff when spent hardware wreckage from the rocket, including one piece the size of a desk, fell on a village in Suining County in neighbouring Hunan province. The county authorities had moved 160,000 people to safety before the liftoff, while more than 20,000 people near the launch site in Sichuan had been moved to a primary school auditorium. The expected wreckage zone for Long March rockets is long and wide.'Solutions' necessary for rocket accidents China Daily, 4 December 2013. Landing Chang'e 3 entered a -high circular lunar orbit on 6 December 2013, 9:53 UTC. The orbit was obtained after 361 seconds (6 minutes) of variable thrust engine braking from its single main engine. Later, the spacecraft adopted a × elliptic orbit. The landing took place one week later, on 14 December. At periapsis, its variable thrusters were again fired in order to reduce its velocity, descending to above the Moon's surface. It hovered at this altitude, moving horizontally under its own guidance to avoid obstacles, before slowly descending to above the ground, at which point its engine was shut down for a free-fall onto the lunar surface. The landing sequence took about 12 minutes to complete. Topographic data from the Chang'e 1 and 2 orbiters were used to select a landing site for Chang'e 3. The planned landing site was Sinus Iridum, but the lander actually descended on Mare Imbrium, about 40 km (24.9 mi) south of the 6 km (3.7 mi) diameter Laplace F crater, at 44.1214°N, 19.5116°W (2640 m elevation) (1.6 mi), on 14 December 2013, 13:11 UTC. Lander With a landing mass of , it also carried and deployed the rover. It serves double-duty as a technology demonstrator to be further refined for the planned 2019 Chang'e 5 sample-return mission. The stationary lander is equipped with a radioisotope heater unit (RHU) in order to heat its subsystems and power its operations, along with its solar panels, during its planned one- year mission. It has a scientific payload of seven instruments and cameras. In addition to their lunar scientific roles, the cameras will also acquire images of the Earth and other celestial bodies. During the 14-day lunar nights, the lander and the rover go into 'sleep mode'. =Lunar-based ultraviolet telescope (LUT)= The lander is equipped with a Ritchey–Chrétien telescope that is being used to observe galaxies, active galactic nuclei, variable stars, binaries, novae, quasars and blazars in the near-UV band (245–340 nm), and is capable of detecting objects at a brightness as low as magnitude 13. The thin exosphere and slow rotation of the Moon allow extremely long, uninterrupted observations of a target. The LUT is the first long term lunar- based astronomical observatory, making continuous observations of important celestial bodies to study their light variation and better improve current models. =Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) camera= The lander also carries an extreme ultraviolet (30.4 nm) camera,2013 – Launches to Orbit and Beyond. Zarya. 1 December 2013. which will be used to observe the Earth's plasmasphere in order to examine its structure and dynamics and to investigate how it is affected by solar activity. =Lander cameras= Three panoramic cameras are installed on the lander, facing different directions. The lander is equipped with a single descent camera that was tested on the Chang'e 2 spacecraft. =Soil probe= The Chang'e 3 lander also carries an extensible soil probe. Rover The development of the six-wheeled rover began in 2002 at the Shanghai Aerospace System Engineering Institute and was completed in May 2010. The rover has a total mass of approximately , with a payload capacity of approximately . The rover may transmit video in real time, and can perform simple analysis of soil samples. It can navigate inclines and has automatic sensors to prevent it from colliding with other objects. Energy was provided by 2 solar panels, allowing the rover to operate through lunar days, as well as charging its batteries. At night the rover was powered down to a large extent, and kept from getting too cold by the use of several radioisotope heater units (RHUs) using plutonium-238.\\"Radioisotope Power Systems: Pu-238 and ASRG status and the way forward\\" by Ralph L. McNutt, Jr., Space Department, Johns Hopkins University, Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, MD 20723 USA. The RHUs provide only thermal energy and no electricity. The rover was deployed from the lander, and made contact with the lunar surface on 14 December, 20:35 UTC. On 17 December it was announced that all of the scientific tools apart from the spectrometers had been activated, and that both the lander and rover were \\"functioning as hoped, despite the unexpectedly rigorous conditions of the lunar environment\\". However, from 16 to 20 December the rover did not move, having shut down its subsystems. Direct solar radiation had raised the temperature on the sunlit side of the rover to over 100 °C (212 °F), while the shaded side simultaneously fell below zero. Since then, the lander and rover finished taking pictures of each other and commenced their respective science missions. The rover was designed to explore an area of during its 3-month mission, with a maximum travelling distance of . The rover demonstrated its ability to endure its first lunar night when it was commanded out of sleep mode on 11 January 2014. On 25 January 2014, China's state media announced the rover had undergone a \\"mechanical control abnormality\\" caused by the \\"complicated lunar surface environment\\".China's first moon rover has experienced a \\"mechanical control abnormality\\" – Australian Broadcasting Corporation – Retrieved 25 January 2014. The rover established contact with mission control on 13 February 2014, but it was still suffering from a \\"mechanical abnormality\\". The rover was still intermittently transmitting as late as 6 September 2014 It ceased to transmit data in March 2015. =Ground-penetrating radar (GPR)= The rover carries a ground- penetrating radar (GPR) on its underside, allowing for the first direct measurement of the structure and depth of the lunar soil down to a depth of , and investigation of the lunar crust structure down to several hundred meters deep. =Spectrometers= The rover carries an alpha particle X-ray spectrometer and an infrared spectrometer, intended to analyze the chemical element composition of lunar samples. =Stereo cameras= There are two panoramic cameras and two navigation cameras on the rover's mast, which stands ~ above the lunar surface, as well as two hazard avoidance cameras installed on the lower front portion of the rover. Each camera pair may be used to capture stereoscopic images, or for range imaging by triangulation. Monitoring by other lunar missions The descent of the Chang'e 3 spacecraft was expected to increase the content of lunar dust in the tenuous lunar exosphere, as well as introduce gases from engine firings during landing. Although there is no formal cooperation between NASA and the China National Space Administration, the landing provided an opportunity for NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission to examine possible changes to the baseline readings of the Moon's exosphere, and will allow it to study how dust and spent propellant gases settle around the Moon after a landing. For example, one of the lander's combustion byproducts is water vapor, and LADEE may be able to observe how lunar water is deposited in cold traps near the poles. NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) took a photograph of the landing site on 25 December 2013 in which the lander and the rover can be seen. LRO also attempted to photograph the lander and rover on 22 January 2014, and on 18 February 2014. Status The rover was still intermittently transmitting as late as 6 September 2014. As of March 2015, the rover remained immobile and its instruments continued degrading, but was still able to communicate with Earth radio stations. While amateur observers were unable to detect transmissions from the lander, Chinese officials reported that the craft was still operating its UV Camera and Telescope as it entered its 14th lunar night on 14 January 2015.China's Chang'e 3 Lander in good Shape as 14th Lunar Night sets in spaceflight101.com The Yutu rover ceased to transmit data in March 2015. The lander and its Lunar-based Ultraviolet Telescope (LUT) are still operational as of June 2018, four and a half years after landing on the Moon. The power source for the lander, which consists of a radioisotope heater unit (RHU) and solar panels, could last for 30 years. Chang'e-3 landing site named 'Guang Han Gong' The landing site of China's first Moon lander Chang'e-3 has been named \\"Guang Han Gong\\" or \\"Moon Palace\\" by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND). Three nearby impact craters were given the names Zi Wei, Tian Shi and Tai Wei, three constellations in traditional Chinese astrology.

Juan Perez Pacheco (1823-1855) was the son of Francisco Perez Pacheco (1790-1860), grantee of Rancho Ausaymas y San Felipe. The rancho lay at a great crossroad where the road from Pacheco Pass into the San Joaquin Valley crossed the El Camino Viejo that lay along the west side of the valley. Its lands included the land and adobe ranch house of the old Spanish Rancho de Centinela (Sentinel Ranch) first established by pioneering stockmen from San Juan Bautista and Monterey as place to raise horses in 1810 and subsequently abandoned in the 1820s. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.

The term regale, here, refers to the granting of royal privileges or rightsLangenscheidt's Muret-Sanders German-English dictionary (Berlin, 2004) gives one translation of the German word Regal as \\"regale\\", a legal and historical term. (droit de régale) in this case to permit the use of water for mining operations in the Harz mountains of Germany. The Upper Harz Water Regale is one of the largest and most important historic mining water management systems in the world. The facilities developed for the generation of water power have been placed under protection since 1978 as cultural monuments. The majority are still used, albeit nowadays their purpose is primarily to support rural conservation (the preservation of a historic cultural landscape), nature conservation, tourism and swimming. From a water management perspective, several of the reservoirs still play a role in flood protection and the supply of drinking water. On 31 July 2010 the Regale was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site affiliated with the Mines of Rammelsberg and the Historic Town of Goslar.Oberharzer Wasserregal zum Weltkulturerbe ernannt tagesschau.de, accessed on 1 August 2010 The water system covers an area of roughly within the Lower Saxon part of the Harz, the majority of structures being found in the vicinity of Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Hahnenklee, Sankt Andreasberg, Buntenbock, Wildemann, Lautenthal, Schulenberg, Altenau and Torfhaus.  The Water Regale  Schematic representation of the Upper Harz Water Regale showing the ponds, ditches and tunnels as well as the use of water power in the mines Regale in this context means a royal prerogative. Through the so-called Bergregal, or \\"mining rights\\", the monarch granted the right to mine and, through the Wasserregal, he granted the right to use local water supplies for the purpose of mining. Other water users, particularly mill owners, had a lower priority. This 'water regale' or 'right to use water' was part of the overall Bergfreiheit or mining rights that were valid in Lower Saxony until the 1960s. In German, the term Oberharzer Wasserwirtschaft (\\"Upper Harz Water Management\\") has also been frequently used to refer to these historic facilities. But this is not precise enough, because in the last hundred years an intensive, modern water management system has been put in place in the Upper Harz in the form of a number of new dams and their associated structures and ditches.  The Upper Harz mining industry  The Upper Harz was once one of the most important mining regions in Germany. The major products of its mines were silver, copper, lead, iron and, from the 19th century, zinc as well. The main source of income, however, was silver. From the 16th to the middle of the 19th centuries about 40–50% of the entire German silver production originated in the Upper Harz. The taxes raised from this contributed significantly to the revenue of the royal houses in Hanover and Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and helped to secure their positions of power and influence within the Holy Roman Empire. Its lucrativeness justified a high commitment in terms of investment and effort. Hereby the Upper Harz mining industry produced a considerable number of innovations and inventions, including such important advances as the man engine, the water-column engine (Wassersäulenmaschine) and the wire cable.  Mining and water  Sketch of ponds, ditches and tunnels between Zellerfeld and Bockswiese around 1868 Mining becomes a very energy-intensive activity as soon as excavation extends any significant distance underground. In the Upper Harz, vein mining (Gangerzbergbau) was the main form of extraction, with excavation following the near-vertical lodes straight down into the earth. Only a few metres down the ingress of water increased the difficulty of excavation considerably. Initially it was mopped up using men standing on ladders, the so-called Wasserknechten (\\"water servants\\"), with their leather buckets. Later, the introduction of horses and whims (Göpel) enabled larger quantities of water to be lifted. But horses were expensive and had to be changed every few hours. As a result, mines - particularly the richer, deeper ones - started to use hydropower systems, able to work continuously, 24 hours a day. To do this, streams were diverted onto water wheels that drove reciprocating pumps in order to raise water from greater depths and in greater quantities. The principle was to raise water with water. To operate these water wheels, a continuous and substantial supply of water was needed. Although the Upper Harz, with an annual precipitation of over 1300 millimetres per year, received copious amounts of water, the mines often lay high up in the mountains close to the watersheds where there were only a few streams of any size. In addition the flow of mountain streams in the rocky terrain was very variable. It often only needed a few weeks of low rainfall for the water supply to the mines to be threatened. This led to several mines having to be closed. In their heyday, the mines of the Upper Harz were among the deepest in the world. For example, as early as 1700, shaft depths of 300 metres were exceeded and, around 1830, a depth of 600 metres was attained; this was now so deep that the mine was actually below sea level - something which was considered significant at that time. Deep shafts, however, demanded correspondingly high levels of energy to lift ore and pit water. This high energy consumption, combined with the heavy demand for water, led to even more strenuous attempts to develop the available water power. The miners usually built new water structures in those periods when no ore could be extracted due to the lack of water to power the wheels. When the water wheels stopped running, the underground water that ingressed the mine could no longer be removed; the mine drowned and the miners were driven out. During these phases work concentrated on upgrading the facilities of the Upper Harz Water Regale.  Water diversion and storage elements  The Dam Ditch near Altenau In all, 143 dammed ponds, 500 kilometres of ditch and 30 kilometres of tunnel were built for the collection, diversion and storage of the surface runoff water in the Upper Harz. In addition about 100 kilometres of drainage adits are included as part of the Regale. These facilities were not, however, all in operation at the same time. The Harzwasserwerke today operates and maintains 65 dammed ponds, 70 kilometres of ditch and 20 kilometres of tunnel. Several smaller dammed ponds still belong to the Lower Saxon State Forestry Department or are even in private hands. The principle of water diversion is to collect the water in ditches, running almost parallel to the contours of the slope, and to divert it to the mining areas. These supply channels can easily be ten or more kilometres long (like the Dam Ditch or the Upper Schalke Ditch). Sometimes the water so collected was not fed directly to the water wheels, but into large, artificial, dammed ponds (Teiche) which acted as reservoirs, in order to ensure enough water was available for the wheels even in times of drought. From the bottom outlets of these ponds the water could be led into a ditch system in order to power the water wheels. Usually several wheels were arranged one after another, like a cascade, so that the water could be used to drive more than one wheel. In order to lead the water over as many wheels as possible, it had to be collected, stored and routed around at the highest possible elevation. The technology of the time did not enable dams to be built with heights of more than about 15 metres. This meant that many small ponds had to be laid out rather than a few larger ones. By arranging the ponds in a cascade, water could be retained at a high elevation in order to drive as many water wheels as possible. A number of these pond cascades were built, comprising four to six ponds. The majority of water wheels were used to drive pumps. Occasionally, the power they generated had to be transmitted over several hundred metres to the mine itself using flat rods (Feldgestänge). Important mines also had a reciprocal water wheel which was used to provide power for transporting the ore and the material to be crushed. All water wheels were of the overshot type. Apart from a few reconstructions, the water wheels all disappeared during the last century.

Dam heights varied between 4.0 and 15.0 metres; impoundment volumes were, on average, about 150,000 cubic metres. ; Ditches The ditches are supply channels almost parallel to the terrain contours, with a very slight incline of around 1-2 per mille and are accompanied by an inspection path. ; Tunnels The underground water tunnels of between 20 and 1000 metres long were the most expensive investments in the Upper Harz Water Regale. They were worth the cost however because of their low operating costs and high hydraulic capacity. ; Special structures * The Sperberhai Dyke is an aqueduct built from 1732 to 1734 with a length of over 900 metres and a height of 16 metres. * The Oderteich differs considerably from the other Upper Harz ponds with regard to its construction materials and dimensions. Following its completion in 1722 to the start of the modern dam building period in 1892, it was the largest dam in Germany. * In the Polsterberg Pumphouse water could be pumped from the Dam Ditch to a height of 8 metres using hydropower. * The Huttaler Widerwaage is also frequently mentioned in this connexion: it is quite complex and enables water to flow in two different directions.

Thanks to the Harzwasserwerke a large number of waterside footpaths have been created in recent years: the so-called Wasserwanderwege. Visitors can get to know about the typical elements that make up the Upper Harz Water Regale by means of information boards along the clearly marked routes. With a few exceptions, most of the ponds can be used by swimmers during the summer months. The majority are also leased to local angling clubs.  History = Construction  Mining activity in the Harz goes back to the 10th and 11th centuries. The first water wheels in the Harz were erected in the 13th century in the Pandelbach valley southeast of Seesen. At that time mining, including this early used of the so-called waterworks (Wasserkünste) for the mines, was managed by the Cistercian abbey at Walkenried. The Black Death in the Middle Ages depopulated the Harz to a great extent and almost brought mining operations to a standstill. Another factor was probably that mining had reached its technical limits at the time with depths of up to about 60 metres. A clear recovery followed from about 1520 onwards, initially at the instigation of the Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, Henry the Younger. But it was his son, Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, who gave added impetus to existing mining operations in the Upper Harz and initiated the creation of a large number of ponds and ditches. It was the extensive use of hydropower that made the mining boom in the Upper Harz possible. As the mines became ever deeper over time they needed more and more energy. The lack of water following months of little rain or long periods of frost were time and again a limiting factor for the mines. The expansion of the water system was achieved by raising the existing pond dams, building new dams, laying new ditches and extending existing ditch runs.  Further improvements: water tunnels and drainage adits  The Ernst August Adit One example of the expansion of the Water Regale network was the optimisation of several ditch courses (the Dam Ditch, Upper and Lower Rosenhof Chutes), mainly during the 19th century, by the construction of so-called Wasserläufen (also Wasserüberleitungsstollen) or water tunnels. These enabled the distance travelled by the water to be significantly shortened. It also guaranteed winter working, because the water running underground did not freeze up. In addition the maintenance cost of a short section of tunnel was much cheaper than that of a long ditch run. But a particularly important advantage was the higher discharge capacity. The tunnels descended the same height difference over a shorter distance and therefore had a steeper incline. Initially the underground sections were laboriously hewn out with hammer and chisel. Later gunpowder was used as an explosive, making the construction of water tunnels considerably easier and faster. Because most of the energy was needed to drain the mines of water and because the need for that continued to grow as mines became deeper, there were attempts early on, to dewater mines using drainage adits (Wasserlösungsstollen). This entailed driving tunnels from the mines to the valleys, through which water could drain away under gravity. The deeper the level of drainage, the longer the adit had to be. The longest of these tunnels is the Ernst August Adit, built in the mid-19th century, which is 35 kilometres long. It collected water from the mines in Bockswiese, Lautenthal, Zellerfeld, Clausthal and Wildemann and led it to Gittelde on the edge of the Harz.  Heyday and decline  About 80–90% of the ponds in the Upper Harz Water Regale were created in the 16th and 17th centuries, whilst the system of dam ditches was further expanded in the 19th century. These structures contributed significantly to the Harz becoming the largest industrial region of Germany in the early modern period. The invention of the steam engine and the discovery of electrical energy did not immediately change the use of hydropower. These other forms of energy were introduced relatively gradually in the Upper Harz. Of course, with the introduction of the steam engine, the difficulties of acquiring coal in sufficient quantities was also a factor until the construction of the Innerste Valley Railway. With the nationalisation of the mines on 1 January 1864 by the Kingdom of Hanover, not only did mining rights now transfer to the state, but also the rights to water usage. So the Kingdom of Hanover also claimed the Water Regale, which was first legally defined in the Prussian Water Law (Preußisches Wassergesetz) of 1913 in sections 16 and 381. Following the absorption of the Kingdom of Hanover into the Kingdom of Prussia, the Royal Prussian Mining Inspectorate (Königlich-Preußische Bergbauinspektion) and, later, Preussag took over the operation of mines in the Upper Harz. An inventory dating to the year 1868 reveals that a total of 198 water wheels of various diameters and a total capacity of about 3000 horsepower were driven by the Upper Harz Water Regale . Around 1900, mining shaft depths of 1,000 metres were attained. But the cost of mining at greater and greater depths continued to rise. As the same time the industry had to compete with other metal mining areas at home and abroad in an era of improving transportation. Overexploitation during the First World War and plummeting metal prices during the Great Depression caused, at its peak, a great wave of closures, as large mines in Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Bockswiese and Lautenthal had to shut down. In Bad Grund, however, mining in the Upper Harz continued until 1992, but it only needed to use a small fraction of the facilities of the Upper Harz Water Regale.  Hydroelectric power  The Crane Pond (Kranicher Teich) near Hahnenklee with its control hut (Striegelhaus) Following the demise of the mining industry in 1930, water from the Upper Harz Water Regale was switched to generating electricity, some new structures being built as a result. The generation of electricity was carried out by Preussag until 1980 in the Kaiser Wilhelm (maximum output 4.5 MW) and Ottiliae (maximum output 1.5 MW) mines. These hydropower stations were closed in the early 1980s when water rights had expired and the profitability of power stations steadily declined against a background of sharply increasing wages and stagnating energy prices. Nevertheless, in Sankt Andreasberg the water of the Oderteich, transferred along the Rehberg Ditch, is still used to generate electricity today. In addition to the Teichtal and Grundstraße power stations, there are two stations in the Samson Pit: the Grüner Hirsch power station at a depth of 130 metres and the Sieberstollen power station at 190 metres.  The Water Regale today  Following the closure of power stations the facilities of the Water Regale were initially transferred to the Lower Saxony State Forestry Department, which maintained them through the Clausthal- Schulenberg Forestry Office at the cost of much labour and money. In order to relieve the state purse, in 1991 the Harzwasserwerke was given the task of operating and maintaining 65 reservoirs, 70 kilometres of ditch and 20 kilometres of water tunnel. The Harzwasserwerke has delegated the management of the Upper Harz Water Regale to its Clausthal office. No public money is spent; the cost of maintenance, a seven-figure sum annually, has to be borne by the Harzwasserwerke through its sale of drinking water. In addition to the facilities entrusted to the Harzwasserwerke there is a large number of dam ruins, tunnel entrances and several hundreds of kilometres of ditches that are not maintained. These structures enjoy the status of a so-called passive protected monument. That means that they are like the ruins of castles, subject to very gradual decay, but which may not be destroyed by modern measures without legal permission under conservation law. The Hirschler Pond is used by the public utilities of Clausthal-Zellerfeld to supply drinking water to Clausthal-Zellerfeld and Altenau; similarly Zellerfeld uses the Upper and Middle Kellerhals Ponds. Hahnenklee gets its drinking water from the Auerhahn Pond, the New Grumbach Pond and the Upper Kellerhals Pond. Schalke  Similar systems  There are similar water supply systems in the historic silver mining region near Freiberg in Saxony, in Norwegian Kongsberg, in Schemnitz (today part of Slovakia) and in Sweden, and records show that there was a regular exchange of experience and know-how between these regions. Nevertheless, the Upper Harz Water Regale, is the largest and most interconnected system of its kind in Europe, with significantly more dams and ditches as well as larger structures than all its counterparts elsewhere.

Los Angeles, California Wood & glass display case designed and built in 2010 by Sal Maccarone for the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park Sal Maccarone is an American author, sculptor, photojournalist and kinetic artist. He is best known as a master craftsman, and for his internationally distributed woodworking books such as Tune Up Your Tools, and How to Make $40,000 a Year Woodworking, both published by F & W publications, Betterway Books, in Cincinnati, Ohio. He is also known for his woodworking technique articles published both online since 1994, Article., Popular Woodworking. and by the national magazine Popular Woodworking. Article., Evolution of an Entryway. Articles such as his \\"Evolution of an Entryway\\" have also been published in industry specific journals. He attended San Jose State University and achieved a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1972. During 1973 and 1974 while enrolled in the Master of Fine Arts Program for sculpture at (SJSU), he studied under professors Sam Richardson, John Battenberg, and Fletcher Benton, all internationally recognized sculptors. While studying for his master's degree in sculpture he became involved in the kinetic sculpture movement of the 1970s. Always using wood as the main media for his sculpture, he also incorporates metal, glass, plastic, and natural stone. His meticulously engineered kinetic sculptures are best described as a combination of fine furniture pieces which contain an impossible bottle type environment that is viewed through glass. The cabinet always remains stationary while the artwork within is kinetic. When turned on, the pieces sequenced with a combination of light and mechanical movement. Video.. He gained national recognition for his furniture, and sculpture in 1977 when he and his work were featured on the KPIX-TV program Evening Magazine. Video.. He was the co- founder of Bears in the Wood a small chain of retail stores in the San Francisco Bay Area which served as the showrooms for furniture that he both designed and built. The stores also sold Teddy bears which were imported from around the world. The merchandise was displayed within an environment which featured a three-story waterfall, and a full scale log cabin. These were the first stores in the country to market \\"just\\" Teddy Bears. The airing of that TV special set off a national Teddy Bear store frenzy in the United States from coast to coast which began in 1976, and continues until the present. In 1979 his work was featured in the Fine Woodworking \\"Design Book Two\\"Taunton Press first printing Sept. 1979 page 194 printed by the Taunton Press. This hardcover book featured photographs of the best work in wood by selected craftsmen from across the United States, and Canada. Working model of a \\"gold stamp mill\\" built by sculptor Sal Maccarone During 1985 Sal was commissioned by the \\"California State Mining and Mineral Association\\" to build a working scale model of a California Gold Rush era \\"Gold Stamp Mill\\". The model currently resides at the California State Mining and Mineral Museum in Mariposa, California. In 1990 his woodwork, and sculpture at the Tenaya Lodge in Yosemite was featured first in the Fresno Bee newspaper, and then on the KGPE CBS TV47 program, Eye on the Valley. Video.. The program was filmed at Sal's studio in Mariposa, California in March 1990. In early 1990 Maccarone began furniture design, and construction for the Chateau du Sureau in Oakhurst, California. Over a period of eighteen months he worked very closely with the hotel owner to ultimately produce eighty different period pieces of furniture, and the castle's Honduras mahogany doors. During the process Sal perfected the distressing process which visually ages the woodwork. Part of that unique process involved using a small gauge shotgun. By glancing the shot at an angle, he discovered that it was possible to simulate worm holes in the faces of the wooden doors. Beginning in 1997, after the publication of his first national woodworking book, he began teaching woodworking technique. Touring the country with The Woodworking Shows, a Los Angeles based traveling trade organization, he gave three-day woodworking seminars in twenty-one different US cities each season. He continued teaching and traveling the country on an average of twice each month until October 2002. In 2009 he began a syndicated newspaper column called, \\"How Art Shapes Our Lives\\". The column is published once each week in the California central valley, Sierra foothills, and the Yosemite area. The column is designed to help build an awareness of the fine arts and the \\"Bigger Picture\\" while pointing to something local that can be observed. Article archives. In 2010 he designed and built the two wood and glass display cases which reside as part of the permanent collection in the Great Lounge of the Ahwahnee Hotel. These furniture pieces were the first new additions to grace the Great Lounge since 1927. Both matching cases are made of native walnut and are primarily used to display the historic baskets made by the Miwok people who once lived in Yosemite Valley. In 2011 the display cases were designated as \\"Reserve Property\\" of the hotel and are now part of the United States national heritage. He has been in the business of designing and building commissioned pieces of furniture, and sculpture since 1972. His woodwork and kinetic sculpture can be viewed in many public, and private collections throughout the United States, and British Columbia. Article. His woodwork portfolio has been used as reference within the Marriott International interior design library system since 1990. As a member of the American Institute for Conservation he has also served as a conservator of furniture for the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park, and has helped to preserve such National treasures as the three Craftsman style harvest tables which were built in 1926 by L & J.G.

A modern administrative unit, also called Phocis, is named after the ancient region, although the modern region is substantially larger than the ancient one. Geopolitically, Phocis was the country of the Phocian people, or Phocians, who self-identified as such, and spoke their own version of Doric Greek, one of the three main dialects of ancient Greek. They were one of several small mountain states of Central Greece, whose dialects are classified as Northwest Doric. It was from their region that the Dorians came who crossed the Gulf of Corinth at the beginning of the Greek Iron Age to burn Pylos and other southern Greek strongholds and seize control of the Peloponnesus. The dialects of the two groups of Dorians north and south of the Gulf then began to diverge. One of the states around Phocis was still called Doris in classical times. As there is considerable evidence that the invasion began about 1000 BC, the ancestors of the classical Phocians might be presumed to have been in place there, though not yet speaking Phocian. Geography Ancient Phocis was about 1,619 km² (625 mi²) in area, bounded on the west by Ozolian Locris and Doris, on the north by Opuntian Locris, on the east by Boeotia, and on the south by the Gulf of Corinth. The massive ridge of Parnassus (2,459 m/8,068 ft), which traverses the heart of the country, divides it into two distinct portions. Being neither rich in material resources nor well placed for commercial enterprise, Phocis was mainly pastoral. No large cities grew up within its territory, and its chief places, such as Delphi and Elatea, were mainly of strategic or cultural importance. Proto-history Ancient Pylos, one of the first palaces burned by intruders coming across the Gulf of Corinth, is fortuitously well-documented by clay- tablet records in Linear B, which were baked and thus preserved by the fire. History The early history of Phocis remains quite obscure. During the Second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC the Phocians at first joined in the national defence, but, by their irresolute conduct at the Battle of Thermopylae lost that position for the Greeks; at the Battle of Plataea they were enrolled on the Persian side. In 457 BC an attempt to extend their influence to the headwaters of the Cephissus in the territory of Doris brought a Spartan army into Phocis in defence of the \\"metropolis of the Dorians\\". A similar enterprise against Delphi in 448 BC was again frustrated by Sparta, but not long afterwards the Phocians recaptured the sanctuary with the help of the Athenians, with whom they had entered into alliance in 454 BC. The subsequent decline of Athenian land power had the effect of weakening this new connection; at the time of the Peloponnesian War Phocis was nominally an ally and dependent of Sparta, and had lost control of Delphi. In the 4th century BC Phocis was constantly endangered by its Boeotian neighbours. After helping the Spartans to invade Boeotia during the Corinthian War (395-94 BC), the Phocians were placed on the defensive. They received assistance from Sparta in 380 BC, but were afterwards compelled to submit to the growing power of Thebes. The Phocian levy took part in the inroads of Epaminondas into Peloponnesus, except in the final campaign of Mantinea (370-362 BC), from which their contingent was withheld. In return for this negligence the Thebans fastened a religious quarrel upon their neighbours, and secured a penal decree against them from the Amphictyonic synod (356 BC). This led to the Third Sacred War (356–346 BC). Third Sacred War (356—346 BC) The Phocians, led by two capable generals, Philomelus and Onomarchus, replied to the penal decree by seizing Delphi and using its riches to hire a mercenary army. With the aid of their mercenaries, the Phocians carried the war into Boeotia and Thessaly, fighting two important battles: the Battle of Crocus Field (353 BC or 352 BC); and the Battle of Thermopylae (353 BC). Though driven out of Thessaly by Philip of Macedon, the war maintained itself for ten years, until the exhaustion of the temple treasures and the treachery of its leaders placed Phocia at Philip's mercy. The conditions which he imposed - the obligation to restore the temple funds, and the dispersion of the population into open villages - were soon disregarded. In 339 BC, the Phocians began to rebuild their cities; in the following year they fought against Philip at Chaeronea. Again in 323 BC, they took part in the Lamian War against Antipater, and in 279 BC helped to defend Thermopylae against the Gauls. Henceforth little more is heard of Phocis. During the 3rd century BC, Phocis passed into the power of Macedonia and of the Aetolian League, to which in 196 BC it was definitely annexed. Under the dominion of the Roman republic the Aetolian League was dissolved, but was revived by Augustus, who also restored to Phocis the votes in the Delphic Amphictyony, which Phocis had lost in 346 BC. Augustus instituted an Achaean synod (σύνοδος) comprising the dependent cities of Peloponnese and central Greece; this body sat at Argos and acted as guardian of Hellenic sentiment. This Achaean synod is last heard of under Trajan.

Active mainly during the interwar period, he was noted as one of the leading proponents of rationalism, opposing it to the Trăirist philosophy of Nae Ionescu. His work, comprising some 20 books, shows Florian as a disciple of centrists and rationalists such as Constantin Rădulescu-Motru and Titu Maiorescu. Active in independent social democratic politics, the philosopher became a political prisoner under the communist regime. It was during his time in jail that Florian conceived his philosophical system, published after his death in the treatise Recesivitatea ca structură a lumii (\\"Recessivity as World Structure\\"). In 1990, he was made a posthumous member of the Romanian Academy. Biography Born in Bucharest, Florian graduated from the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy at the local university, where he became a disciple of Rădulescu-Motru and P. P. Negulescu. Oana-Georgiana Enăchescu, \\"Mircea Florian - nedreptatea unui destin\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 13/2002 He afterward took his Ph.D. at the University of Greifswald, in the German Empire, with a thesis on Henri Bergson's notion of time. In later years, he found employment as a Bucharest University assistant and substitute professor, lecturing in the History of Philosophy. He was a Docent from 1916.Boia (2010), p.350 During World War I, Florian served in the Romanian Land Forces and was taken prisoner by the Germans. He was transported to an internment camp at Krefeld, alongside figures such as Alexandru D. Strurdza and Ilie Moscovici. Constantin C. Gomboș, \\"Însemnări din prizonieratul german\\", in Historia, May 2006 Eventually, Florian was freed by his captors and allowed to lecture at King Carol Foundation in Bucharest, under a German occupation government. As Florian later indicated, this was made possible by the intercession of a Germanophile scholar, Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș, who vouched for him, and by the protection of Constantin Giurescu. Following the November Armistice, which reinstated the pro-Allied government, Florian, Tzigara-Samurcaș and Rădulescu-Motru were all subject to an official inquiry, and accused of being collaborators. The University Commissions created for this task were largely ineffective, and, among the incriminated, Florian was one of few who presented himself for questioning.Boia (2010), p.347-356 In the wake of the war, Florian was in contact with Ideea Europeană, Rădulescu- Motru's magazine, and went on its conference tour, alongside in various cities by, among others, Nae Ionescu, Cora Irineu, Octav Onicescu, Virgil Bărbat, and Emanoil Bucuța. Gheorghe Grigurcu, \\"Memoriile unui hedonist\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 41/2000 However, in later years, he remained largely cut off from his public: said to have been shy in delivering his lectures, he led a private life, and dedicated himself, almost entirely, to research. He wrote a large body of works over a short time, including such titles as: Îndrumare în filosofie (\\"Philosophical Companion\\"), Rostul și utilitatea filosofiei (\\"The Purpose and Use of Philosophy\\"), Știință și raționalism (\\"Science and Rationalism\\"), Cosmologia elenă (\\"Hellenic Cosmology\\"), Antinomiile credinței (\\"The Antinomies of Faith\\"), Kant și criticismul până la Fichte (\\"Kant and the Critical Method before Fichte\\"), Cunoaștere și existență (\\"Knowledge and Being\\"), Reconstrucție filosofică (\\"Philosophical Reconstruction\\"), Metafizică și artă (\\"Metaphysics and Art\\"), Misticism și credință (\\"Mysticism and Faith\\"). Although absorbed by his academic work, Florian affiliated with social democracy, and was a member of the Social Democratic Party, the Constantin Titel Petrescu wing. Florian's philosophy developed from ideas common to both Rădulescu-Motru and the 19th-century thinker Titu Maiorescu, herald of Romania's moderate and critical approach to philosophy. Florian is therefore ranked among the third-generation \\"Maiorescans\\", and seen as reactivating the spirit of Maiorescu's literary club Junimea. Z. Ornea, \\"O pasionantă carte de filosofie\\", in România Literară, Nr. 17/1999 After World War I, the Junimist legacy came in direct contradiction with Nae Ionescu's critique of rationalism, which was growing in popularity and lending its support to the far right's causes. Florian's steady opposition to Ionescu, in both concept and method, has been described as the \\"dualism\\" of interwar Romanian philosophy. By the time of World War II, Mircea Florian was still pursuing a debate with the two schools of irrationalism, promoted by Lucian Blaga and Constantin Noica. Granted a full professorship in 1940, he was presented for Romanian Academy membership by his mentor Rădulescu-Motru, but the proposal failed to gather support. Blaga gave poor reviews to his work in Saeculum magazine, and, in one (disputed) interpretation, may have portrayed him as the unknown adversary in the virulent lampoon Săpunul filozofic (\\"Philosophic Soap\\", 1943). Florian Roatiș, \\"Despre polemica Blaga-Motru\\", in România Literară, Nr. 4/2009 According to literary historian Z. Ornea, Florian's relative lack of exposure is unfair, since his works may rank better than those of either Noica or Blaga. Florian was also an adversary of official fascism, before and during the Ion Antonescu dictatorship. Like Grigore T. Popa, Constantin I. Parhon, Alexandru Rosetti, Mihai Ralea, and several other academics, he was in contact with the underground Romanian Communist Party and the Union of Patriots, and, as such, kept under close surveillance by the Siguranța Statului agents.Boia (2012), p.236-237 Florian's stance, and especially his commitment to independent social democracy, made him a suspect upon the establishment of Romania's communist regime. As noted by researcher Victor Frunză, Florian and Alexandru Claudian made a \\"high sacrifice\\" when they refused to give in to \\"blackmail\\" and would not join the \\"Workers' Party\\" (as the Communist Party styled itself upon its absorption of Social Democratic sympathizers).Victor Frunză, Istoria stalinismului în România, Humanitas, Bucharest, 1990, p.274. In 1948, he was stripped of his university chair.Boia (2012), p.302 Placed under constant surveillance by the Securitate, Romania's new secret police, he was soon after arrested. During his eight-month-long imprisonment without trial, he had the revelation on \\"recessivity as world structure\\". The new system evidenced that Florian had come to criticize some of the basic assumptions in Western philosophy, and conceiving of the world through the teachings of genetics. His system divided existence alongside its two, equal but alternating, attributes: the dominant trait tempered by the recessive (albeit not degraded) one; violence to love, rational to irrational, nationalism to supranationalism. The imprisonment is said to have been a grueling experience: allegedly, his wife Angela no longer recognized him upon his return to the family home. A while after, Florian was partly reintegrated into academia, and assigned a researcher's position at the Institute of Philosophy. There, he dedicated himself to translating Aristotle's Organon, while in committing his Recesivitatea to paper in his spare time. Recesivitatea was only published 23 years after Florian's death, with Editura Eminescu. Reportedly, the text had suffered cuts and interventions by communist censors. Florian's role was reconsidered mainly after the Romanian Revolution of 1989, when he was made a posthumous member of the Academy. His full work was recovered for the public and reviewed by philosopher Mircea Flonta, in a 1998 volume of essays. NotesReferences *Lucian Boia, **Capcanele istoriei.

It is one of two subspecies found in Spain. Description The capercaillie is a large grouse, in length, with the female much smaller than the male. It has dark grey plumage with fine blackish vermiculation (wavelike pattern) around the head and neck. The breast is glossy greenish-black. It has a long, rounded tail, an ivory-white bill, and a scarlet crest.World Association of Zoos and Aquaria (WAZA). 2009. WAZA’s virtual zoo – Western Capercaillie.

Distribution and habitat The subspecies once ranged the length of the Cantabrian Mountains from northern Portugal, through Galicia, Asturias and León, to Cantabria in northern Spain (IUCN Redbook 1979, p. 1). Its range has since contracted to the mountains in northwest Spain. It inhabits an area of 1,700 km2 (656 mi2), and is separated from the nearest neighbouring subspecies (T. u. aquitanicus) in the Pyrenees by a distance of more than .Quevedo, M., J.M. Bañuelos, O. Sáez, and J.R. Obeso. 2006. Habitat selection by Cantabrian capercaillie Tetroa urogallus cantabrius at the edge of the species’ distribution. Wildlife Biology 12(3): 267–276. Capercaillies are able to digest conifer needles, and their typical habitat is often described as old coniferous forest. However, the Cantabrian subspecies is not as reliant as other Western capercaillies on pine forest, a type of habitat which is relatively scarce in the Cantabrian mountains.Disappearance Of Pine Trees In Spain's Cantabrian Mountains Threatens Cantabrian Capercaillie Bird, Plataforma SINC (2008, 21 November). ScienceDaily. Retrieved 19 September 2011, from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081121151920.htm The Cantabrian capercaillie feeds in deciduous woodland, and occurs in mature beech forest and mixed forests of beech and oaks (at elevations ranging from . The capercaillie also uses other microhabitat types such as broom, meadow and heath selectively throughout the year. It feeds on beech buds, birch catkins, and holly leaves. It also feeds on bilberry, a common component of its diet (Rodriguez and Obeso 2000 as reported in.Pollo, C.J., L. Robles, J.M. Seijas, Á. García-Miranda, and R. Otero. (2005). Trends in the abundance of Cantabrian Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus cantabricus at leks on the southern slope of the Cantabrian Mountains, north-west Spain. Bird Conservation International 15:397–409. Conservation and status Storch et al. (2006) estimates the population to be 627 birds, of which approximately 500 are adults, according to the most recent population data collected from 2000 through 2003.Storch, I., M.J. Bañuelos, A. Fernández-Gil, J.R. Obeso, M. Quevedo and R. Rodríquez- Muñoz. (2006). Subspecies Cantabrian capercaillie Tetrao urogallus cantabricus endangered according to IUCN criteria. Journal of Ornithology 147:653–655. Population estimates for species of grouse are commonly assessed by counting males that gather during the leks (traditional places where males assemble during the mating season and engage in competitive displays that attract females). Pollo et al. (2005) estimated a 60–70 percent decline in the number of male leks since 1981. This is equivalent to an average decline of 3 percent per year, or 22 percent over 8 years. There is also evidence of a 30-percent decline in lek occupancy in the northern watershed of the species’ range between 2000 and 2005. Based on data collected between 2000 and 2003 by Pollo et al. (2005), the distribution of Cantabrian capercaillie on the southern slope of the Cantabrian Mountains is fragmented into 13 small subpopulations: four in the western area and 9 in the eastern. Six subpopulations (5 in the eastern and 1 in the western) contained only one singing male, which indicates a very small subpopulation, since presence of singing males is a direct correlate to population numbers. The area occupied by Cantabrian capercaillie in 1981–1982 covered up to approximately 2,070 km2 (799 mi2) of the southern slope 972 km2 (375 mi2) in the west and 1,098 km2 (424 mi2) in the east). Between 2000 and 2003, the area of occupancy had declined to 693 km2 (268 mi2), specifically 413 km2 (159 mi2) in the west and 280 km2 (108 mi2) in the east. Thus, over a 22–year period, there was a 66-percent reduction in the areas occupied by this subspecies on the southern slope of the Cantabrian Mountains. Based on this data, the subpopulation in the eastern portion of the range appears to be declining at a faster rate than the subpopulation in the western portion of the range. Although Storch, et al. (2006) noted that the Cantabrian capercaillie meets the criteria to be listed as \\"Endangered\\" on the IUCN Red List due to \\"rapid population declines, small population size, and severely fragmented range\\", it is not classified as such by the IUCN. The species is classified as \\"Endangered\\" in Spain under the National Catalog of Endangered Species. The species has not been formally considered for listing in the CITES Appendices (http://www.cites.org). In 2011, United States Fish and Wildlife Service listed the Cantabrian capercaillie as an endangered species.Six Foreign Bird Species Receive Endangered Species Act Protection ThreatsHabitat destruction= Numerous limiting factors influence the population dynamics of the capercaillie throughout its range, including habitat degradation, loss, and fragmentation (Storch 2000, p. 83; 2007, p. 96).Storch, I., (2000). Grouse: Status Survey and conservation Action Plan 2000-2004. IUCN, Gland, Switzerland / World Pheasant Association, Reading, UK, 116p. Forest structure plays an important role in determining habitat suitability and occupancy. Quevedo et al. (2006) found that open forest structure with well-distributed bilberry shrubs were the preferred habitat type of Cantabrian capercaillie. Management of forest resources for timber production has caused and continues to cause significant changes in forest structure such as: species composition, density and height of trees, forest patch size, and understory vegetation. The historic range occupied by this subspecies has declined by more than 50 percent. The current range is severely fragmented, with low forest habitat cover (22 percent of the landscape) and most of the suitable habitat remaining in small patches less than .Garcia, D., M. Quevedo, R. Obeso, and A. Abajo. (2005). Fragmentation patterns and protection of montane forest in Cantabrian range (NW Spain). Forest Ecology and Management 208: 29-43. Patches of good-quality habitat are scarce and discontinuous, particularly in the central parts of the range, and leks in the smaller forest patches have been abandoned during the last few decades. The leks that remain occupied are now located farther from forest edges than those occupied in the 1980s. Based on population surveys, forest fragments containing occupied leks in 2000 were significantly larger than fragments containing leks in the 1980s that have since been abandoned. The forest fragments from which the Cantabrian capercaillie has disappeared since the 1980s are small in size, and are the most isolated from other forest patches. In addition, the Cantabrian capercaillie have disappeared from forest patches located closest to the edge of the range in both the eastern and western subpopulations of the south slope of the Cantabrian Mountains, suggesting that forest fragmentation is playing an important role in the population dynamics of this subspecies. Research conducted on other subspecies of capercaillie indicate that the size of forest patches is correlated to the number of males that gather in leks to display, and that below a certain forest patch size, leks are abandoned. In highly fragmented landscapes, forest patches are embedded in a matrix of other habitats, and forest dwellers like capercaillies frequently encounter open areas within their home range. Quevedo et al. (2005)Quevedo, M., M.J. Bañuelos, and J.R. Obeso. (2005). The decline of Cantabrian capercaillie: How much does habitat configuration matter? Biological Conservation 27(2): 190–200. developed a habitat suitability model for the Cantarian capercaillie that assessed the relationship between forest patch size and occupancy. He determined that the subspecies still remains in habitat units that show habitat suitability indices below the cut-off values of the two best predictive models (decline and general), which may indicate a high risk of local extinction. Other researchers suggested that, should further habitat or connectivity loss occur, the Cantabrian capercaillie population may become so disaggregated that the few isolated subpopulations will be too small to ensure their own long-term persistence (Grimm and Storch 2000, p. 224).Grimm, V. and I. Storch. (2000). Minimum viable population size of capercaillie Tetrao Urogallus: results from a stochastic model. Wildlife Biology 6(4): 219–225. A demographic model based on Bavarian alpine populations of capercaillie suggest a minimum viable population size of the order of 500 birds. However, genetic data show clear signs of reduced variability in populations with numbers of individuals in the range of fewer than 1000 birds, which indicates that a demographic minimum population of 500 birds may be too small to maintain high genetic variability.Segelbacher, G., J. Höglund, and I. Storch. (2003). From connectivity to isolation: genetic consequences of population fragmentation in capercaillie across Europe. Molecular Ecology 12: 1773–1780. Genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation exist for this species in the form of increased genetic differentiation due to increased isolation of populations. Therefore, anthropogenic habitat deterioration and fragmentation not only leads to range contractions and extinctions, but may also have significant genetic, and thus, evolutionary consequences for the surviving populations. Recent population surveys show this subspecies is continuing to decline throughout its current range, andsubpopulations may be isolated from one another due to range contractions in the eastern and western portions of its range, leaving the central portion of the subspecies range abandoned. Some remaining populations may already have a high risk of local extinction. Management of forest resources for timber production continues to negatively affect forest structure, thereby affecting the quality, quantity, and distribution of suitable habitat available for this subspecies. In addition, the structure of the matrix of habitats located between forest patches is likely affecting the ability of capercaillies to disperse between subpopulations. Therefore, we find that present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of the habitat or range is a threat to the continued existence of the Cantabrian capercaillie throughout its range. =Overhunting= Currently hunting of the Cantabrian capercaillie is illegal in Spain; however, illegal hunting still occurs (storch 2007, p. 96). Because this species congregates in leks, individuals are particularly easy targets, and poaching of protected grouse is considered common (Storch 2000, p. 15). It is unknown what the incidence of poaching is or what impact it is having on this subspecies; however, given the limited number of birds remaining and the reduced genetic variability already evident at current population levels, the further loss of breeding adults could have substantial impact on the subspecies. =Disease and predation= Diseases and parasites have been proposed as factors associated with the decline of populations of other species within the same family of birds as the capercaillie (Tetraonidae).Obeso, J.R., L.D. Rodriguez, I. Álvarez, E. Niño, and J.C. Del Campo. (2000). Intestinal parasites in the Cantabrian capercaillie Tetrao urogallus cantabricus: A coprological study. In an attempt to determine if parasites were contributing to the decline of the Cantabrian capercaillie, researchers collected and analyzed fecal samples in 1998 from various localities across the range of this subspecies. The prevalence of common parasites (Eimeria sp. and Capillaria sp.) was present in 58 percent and 25 percent of the samples collected, respectively. However, both the intensity and average intensity of these parasites were very low compared to other populations of species of birds in the family Tetraonidae. Other parasites were found infrequently. The researchers concluded that it was unlikely that intestinal parasites were causing the decline of the Cantabrian capercaillie. =Inadequacy of existing protection= Although it meets the qualifications, the Cantabrian capercaillie is currently not classified as endangered by the IUCN. Nor is the species listed under any Appendix of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This subspecies is currently classified as ‘‘vulnerable’’ in Spain under the National Catalog of Endangered Species, which affords it special protection (e.g., additional regulation of activities in the forests of its range, regulation of trails and roads in the area, elimination of poaching, and protection of areas important to young). Although it is classified as vulnerable, as mentioned above (see Factor B), illegal hunting still occurs. This subspecies is also afforded special protection under the Bern Convention (Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats; European Treaty Series/104; Council of Europe 1979). The Cantabrian capercaillie is listed as ‘‘strictly protected’’ under Appendix II, which requires member states to ensure the conservation of the listed taxa and their habitats. Under this Convention, protections of Appendix-II species include the prohibition of: * deliberate capture, keeping and killing of the species; * deliberate damage or destruction of breeding sites; * deliberate disturbance during the breeding season; * deliberate taking or destruction of eggs; * the possession or trade of any individual of the species. It is difficult to assess the effectiveness of this designation in preventing further loss of Cantabrian capercaillie or its habitat. However, the EU Habitats Directive is a response to the Bern Convention. The Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) addresses the protection of habitat and species listed as endangered at the European scale (European Union 2008). Several habitat types valuable to capercaillie have been included in this Directive, such as in Appendix I, Section 9, Forests. The EU Birds Directive lists the capercaillie as an Annex 1 species, \\"subject to special habitat conservation measures in order to ensure their survival.’’ Under this Directive, a network of Special Protection Areas (SPAs) comprising suitable habitat for Annex I species is to be designated. This network of SPAs and other protected sites are collectively referred to as Natura 2000. As an EU member state, Spain has designated SPAs. The remaining Cantabrian capercaillie populations occur primarily in protected areas in Spain that are part of the Natura 2000 network (for example, Muniellos nature reserve). Management of natural resources by local communities is still allowed in areas designated as an SPA; however, the development of management plans to meet the various objectives of the Reserve network is required. In November 2003, Spain enacted the ‘‘Forest Law,’’ which addresses the preservation and improvement of the forest and rangelands in Spain. This law requires development of plans for the management of forest resources, which are to include plans for fighting forest fires, establishment of danger zones based on fire risk, formulation of a defense plan in each established danger zone, the mandatory restoration of burned area, and the prohibition of changing forest use of a burned area into other uses for a period of 30 years. In addition, this law provides economic incentives for sustainable forest management by private landowners and local entities. Despite recent advances in protection of this subspecies and its habitat through EU Directives and protection under Spanish law and regulation, illegal poaching still occurs (Storch 2000, p. 83; 2007, p. 96). =Other threats= Suarez-Seoane and Roves (2004)Suárez-Seonae, S. and P. García-Rovés. (2004). Do disturbances in surrounding areas affect a core population of Cantabrian Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus catabricus? The case of the natural reserve of Muniellos (Asturias, NW Spain). Ardeola 51(2): 395–409. assessed the potential impacts of human disturbances in core populations of Cantabrian capercaillie in Natural Reserves in Spain. They found that locations selected as leks were located at the core of larger patches of forest and were less subject to human disturbance. They also found that Cantabrian capercaillie disappeared from leks situated in rolling hills at lower altitudes closer to houses, hunting sites, and repeatedly burned areas. Recurring fires have also been implicated as a factor in the decline of the subspecies. An average of of forested area per year over a 10–year period (1995–2005) has been consumed by fire in Spain.Lloyd, N. (2007). Forest fires in Spain. IberiaNature: A guide to the natural history of Spain. Downloaded from http://www.iberianature.com/material/fire.htm on 1/11/2008. On average, 80 percent of all fires in Spain are set intentionally by humans. Suarez-Seoane and Garcia-Roves (2004) found that the stability of Cantabrian capercaillie breeding areas throughout a 20–year period was mainly related to low fire recurrence in the surrounding area and few houses nearby. In addition, the species avoids areas that are recurrently burned because the areas lose their ability to regenerate and cannot produce the habitat the species requires.

History Grand Ditch seen from the Holzwarth Historic District The Grand Ditch was built by the Larimer County Ditch Company, mostly by Japanese crews, working with hand tools and black powder. The first diverted water flowed east across La Poudre Pass on October 15, 1890. Water Supply and Storage Company took over ownership in 1891.Water across the Divide, in High Country News, October 12, 2009, http://www.hcn.org/issues/41.17/water-across-the-divide The ditch was extended every year, and reached three miles in 1894. After the creation of Rocky Mountain National Park, increasing demand for water led to the creation of Long Draw Reservoir, and the required land was taken away from the park by Congress in 1923. Long Draw reservoir opened in 1930. The Grand Ditch was then lengthened one more time—this also required an act of Congress since it was now in a national park—to in September 1936. In May 2003 a 100-foot section of the ditch breached about south of La Poudre Pass, causing the water to cascade down the slopes and into the Colorado River. The flood left a visible scar on the mountainside: 20,000 trees were downed and 47,600 cubic yards of debris ended up in the Lulu Creek and the headwaters of the Colorado River. The Water Supply and Storage Company reached a settlement to pay $9 million in damages to Rocky Mountain National Park. Periodic overflows of the ditch, of which the 2003 flood was but one example, has left debris all over the western side of the valley; the eastern side is not affected. The Grand River Ditch was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 29, 1976. It can be hiked starting from the Bowen/Baker Trailhead in Rocky Mountain National Park.

Plot The story begins in London where a Basque ex-priest named Juan Uriarte is on trial, accused of attempting to purchase chemicals and plotting a terrorist attack. The trial is covered by an English reporter named Kate Ramsay. Uriarte's Catholic charitable outreach service is also suspected of being a front for radicals; however, Uriarte manages to avoid prosecution by claiming his intention was to eliminate the camels of a Muslim faction in Sudan. Not convinced, Ramsay becomes determined to undercover the truth and she travels with him to Uganda to see his charity's work first hand. In due course, she becomes attracted to Uriarte and offers to assist him with his plans. This works well for Uriarte, as he recruits her help, resulting in trips to Cairo and Rome. Ramsay is unaware of the actual purpose of these trips, but is sympathetic to Uriarte's convictions and she smuggles an illegal item into Rome, which she believes is a Coptic relic. In the meantime, the story reveals an international conspiracy that is developing and is aimed at the Vatican. With the death of Pope John Paul II and the 2005 Papal conclave that elected Joseph Ratzinger as Pope Benedict XVI as a backdrop, a plot unfolds to destroy \\"the longest continuous government in the world — the Papacy\\".About The Death of a Pope It becomes apparent that the real purpose behind Uriarte's actions was to murder the Conservative faction of the Church and open a path for more Liberal-minded clergy to take control of the Church. Uriarte's plot is unknowingly foiled by Ramsay's uncle, a conservative priest from England. Reception Award-winning novelist Ron Hansen wrote: \\"Piers Paul Read has managed to combine sheer storytelling power with great learning and insight about the inner workings of the Church to fashion an entertainment of the highest order. If John le Carré took on Vatican politics, his book of suspense might aspire to be much like this one.\\"Fantastic Fiction: Ron Hansen Michael Coren began his review of The Death of a Pope with the claim: \\"If there were any justice in the world of letters, Piers Paul Read would be spoken of with Amis, Barnes, Rushdie and the rest of the dominant literary class wherever the great contemporary British novelists were mentioned.\\" In The Death of a Pope, Coren noted, \\"Read is impressive but in some ways jarring in that he's prepared to give some of the best lines to the bad guys.\\" But it is typical of a novelist of Read's quality \\"that the characters in black hats are deliciously ambivalent — though the author has a taut and trusted morality, he's too sophisticated to make his characters mere conduits for right and wrong. There is complexity here, confusion, a sing-song of lyrical paradox and good intentions leading to colossally evil acts. It's impossible, by the end of the book, to feel smugly satisfied that all is well with the world that Read has just shown us, and I suspect that is precisely what the man wants us to experience.\\"Michael Coren.

The unit is a joint effort between all constituent countries within the Kingdom. Prior to the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles, it was known as the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba Coast Guard (NA&A; CG) and a division of the Royal Netherlands Navy. Tasks * Detection and control: drugs, border control, customs control at sea, fisheries and environmental surveillance and monitoring of safe shipping. * Services: continuous occupation and Rescue Coordination Center (RCC), handling of maritime distress and safety radio communications, search and rescue (SAR) and supporting maritime contingency. Organization DCCG is a partnership between Aruba, Sint Maarten, Curaçao, and the Netherlands. The staff of the Coast Guard is composed of all constituent countries. DCCG is a Kingdom organization directly under the State Council of Ministers of the Kingdom. The Commander of the Naval Forces of the Royal Netherlands Navy in the Caribbean (CZMCARIB) is also the director of DCCG. Policy Ministries from the four parts of the kingdom determine the policy of the Coast Guard. To streamline policy formulation the Coast Guard's Commission has been formed. This committee consists of officials from different ministries. The Coast Guard Commission also ensures budgets and annual reports. The judicial policy of the Coast Guard is determined by the three Ministers of Justice of the countries of the Kingdom. Controlling the Coast Guard executive in judicial matters is done through the Prosecutors-General of Aruba, Curaçao, St Maarten, and the Netherlands. The Secretary of Defense is on behalf of the State Ministers in charge of managing and controlling DCCG. Coast Guard support centers DCCG has three Coast Guard support centers: on Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten. From here, the Coast Guard patrol boats patrol in the waters around the islands. The flying units of the Coast Guard are stationed at Coast Guard Air Station Hato, Curaçao. The Coast Guard Center / RCC itself is located in Curaçao, at the Parera naval base. Units DCCG has its own units and also makes use of defense resources (mainly from the RNLN, a ship and staff). DCCG has several private owned types of patrol boats, cutters and aircraft. Cutters Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard cutter Jaguar with two s in the background The three Coast Guard cutters, the Jaguar, the Panther and Puma, are Damen Stan 4100 patrol vessels. They are designed for service in the coastal waters of the Caribbean islands. The cutters are suitable for carrying out all coast guard tasks. With the onboard RHIB, boarding operations can be performed. The cutter is over long, has a crew of eleven and a speed exceeding . Each boat has radar, infrared cameras, night vision binoculars, an ION-scan, a fixed 12,7mm Machinegun and a rotatable water cannon. Furthermore, they are equipped with photographic and video equipment to collect evidence. The DCCG is planning on replacing the cutters by 2018. Inshore boats The inshore boats are mostly deployed within a mile from the coast. The boats of the type RHIB Sea 700 are in service in the Coast Guard since September 13, 1997. They have a curb and therefore very suitable for carrying out boarding operations on other boats without damaging them. In addition, the boats, with a speed above , are very quick and well able to chase suspicious boats and arrest suspects. The Coast Guard has six of these boats. Super RHIBS The Coast Guard has twelve Super Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats, or SuperRhibs. These high- speed boats, capable of speeds in excess of and highly maneuverable, are very suitable for carrying out boarding operations. The crew of the SuperRHIB can be up to six people. The SuperRHIBs have a length of , a width of , a height of and a weight of . Whereas the inshore boats operate mostly close to shore, the SuperRHIBs operate at much wider and longer distance at sea. The inboard diesel engines and the longer form of the hull allow the SuperRHIB to deal with even worse weather conditions while maintaining good sailing characteristics. AgustaWestland AW139 An AW139 from the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard DCCG employs two AgustaWestland AW139 helicopters for high speed chase, and search and rescue operations. The AgustaWestland AW139 helicopters are stationed at Coast Guard Air Station Hato. Bombardier Dash 8 Since the autumn of 2007, the DCCG has two Bombardier Dash 8 Maritime Patrol Aircraft (designated MPA-D8). These planes are built to the specific needs of DCCG, based on the Coast Guard tasks such as Search And Rescue, fisheries and environmental monitoring. These two Dash 8 aircraft equipped with modern means of day and at night to obtain optimal results in the performance of its duties. These resources include specially designed for hatch'es dropping life rafts and drift / marker buoys, a high power searchlight in the nose of the aircraft with the aim to see and be seen in search situations, radar, and a communication and interlink software system. All these resources make it the ideal airplane is a coordinating role between various units and the RCC. Besides these functions, both Dash 8 can be deployed before, during and after hurricane passages to move people and resources to those areas that need help. For these missions the Dash 8 will be converted into transport aircraft configurations. West Indies Guard Ship The West Indies Guard Ship (WIGS) is a ship of the Royal Netherlands Navy that rotates about every six months. It is usually a frigate but it can also be another naval vessel. This vessel usually carries a NHIndustries NH90 helicopter for search and rescue tasks and pursuit of suspect vessels. A special boarding team from the U.S. Coast Guard can be embarked on board the WIGS, authorized to carry out boardings beyond the territorial waters of the Dutch Caribbean islands. This cooperation between Aruba, Curaçao, the Netherlands, Sint Maarten, the United States, and other actors is formalized in the Joint Interagency Task Force South, situated in Key West, Florida, United States. Personnel DCCG has approximately 160 personnel. Of these, 140 come from Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten, and 20 from the Royal Netherlands Navy. These 160 consist mostly of personnel actually deployed to carry out operations and the occupation of the Coast Guard bases. In addition, there are about 15 employees who staff the Operations Center / RCC 24 hours a day.

By the early eighteenth century, it had become one of the most prized cultivars for cider: a letter written by a Hugh Stafford in 1727 states \\"I have been told by a person of credit that a hogshead of cider from this fruit has been sold in London for £8 or eight guineas, and that often a hogshead of French wine has been given in exchange for the same quantity of Fox-whelp. It is said to contain a richer and more cordial juice than even the Red-streak itself\\".Hogg, R. The fruit manual, Journal of Horticulture Office, 1884, 63 Along with many other old varieties of apple, the Foxwhelp is now rare. Some sources state that many apples identified as Foxwhelp today are not, in fact, the original variety, which came to be known as \\"Old Foxwhelp\\" to distinguish it from later sports (such as Improved Foxwhelp, developed by H. P. Bulmer), which were selected from the original cultivar. By the 1960s the Long Ashton Research Station could locate only \\"a few very old trees\\" of Old Foxwhelp in Herefordshire and Gloucestershire.Annual report of the Agricultural and Horticultural Research Station, 1963, p.84 However, the Gloucestershire Apple Collection did manage to secure cuttings for propagation from an orchard in Gloucestershire, which had been used by Long Ashton as a source of Foxwhelp propagating material until the 1950s.Martell, C. Native Apples of Gloucestershire , Gloucestershire Orchard Group, p.104 Characteristics The Foxwhelp is classed as a \\"bittersharp\\" cider apple, containing high levels of tannin and malic acid. It has small to medium-sized fruit, usually ripening in September, with an uneven, ridged shape, and a deep crimson skin with yellow stripes. Its flesh is acidic and yellow with a red tinge, and its juice will produce a powerful, tannic cider. Hogg found that its \\"extremely rich and saccharine\\" juice had a specific gravity of 1076, and even higher in shrivelled fruit, and noted that it was used in most Herefordshire ciders to add strength. The tree has a naturally upright habit, with large branches; the leaves are distinctively curled and wavy. It is particularly known for its tendency to produce sports (mutations), on single branches. These mutations were a source of many of the later 'improved' varieties of Foxwhelp, such as Black Foxwhelp,Martell, p.107 Red Foxwhelp, and possibly Broxwood Foxwhelp. The 'New' or 'Rejuvenated Foxwhelp' (syn. 'Crow's Kernel', 'Canon Apple') was a 19th-century attempt to improve the old variety by a process of working scions of 'Old Foxwhelp' onto seedlings of the same variety. Hogg said that the process was begun in around 1800 by a Mr. Yeomans of Much Cowarne, and continued by a Mr. Crowe of Canon Pyon, after which the variety came to the attention of growers.Hogg, R. The Apple and Pear as Vintage Fruits pp.151-2 The Foxwhelp is susceptible to the disease apple scab.

From 1902–1906, Mahnke studied at Göttingen under Edmund Husserl and David Hilbert. After serving in the First World War (stationed in Lens, France), he graduated from the University of Freiburg in 1925 with a thesis on Leibniz. The thesis was later published in the Jahrbuch für Philosophie und phänomenologische Forschung as Leibnizens Synthese von Universalmathematik und Individualmetaphysik. In 1926 he habilitated at Greifswald with a thesis entitled Neue Einblicke in die Entdeckungsgeschichte der höheren Analysis. In 1927 he became a professor of philosophy at Marburg. In 1934 he became a member of the Nazi SA.George Leaman: Heidegger im Kontext: Gesamtüberblick zum NS-Engagement der Universitätsphilosophen (= Ideologische Mächte im deutschen Faschismus. Band 5). Argument, Hamburg 1993, , p. 107. Mahnke's work in the history of mathematics focussed primarily on Leibniz's development of the infinitesimal calculus, and his relationship to Neo-Platonism. His last book, Unendliche Sphäre und Allmittelpunkt, Beiträge zur Genealogie der mathematischen Mystik was a study of the use of mathematical symbolism, especially the notion of \\"infinite spheres\\", in religious mysticism. At the time of his death, Mahnke was editing a volume of Leibniz's mathematical correspondence. This project was then taken over by Joseph Ehrenfried Hofmann. Mahnke was killed in a car accident. His Nachlass is preserved at the University of Marburg.

The subjects represented by the division mirror the subjects of the other Clements divisions with strengths in American military history, political and social histories, American urban and landscape views, portraiture, satire, popular culture, leisure activities, labor, technology, travel, and culinary history. Examples of almost every printing and photographic process used from the 15th to the 20th centuries exists within the collections. The Library has recently acquired the David V. Tinder Collection of Michigan Photography, representing over 100,000 photographs taken from ca. 1845 -1980 in the state. Approximate numbers for the division holdings: *Prints—9400 items *Photos—150,000 *Ephemera—10,000 *Sheet music—15,000 *Artwork—150 *Realia – 100 Clements Library Associates Clements Library Associates support the library through membership dues and can contribute at several levels, beginning at \\"Student\\" with a $5 membership fee.

M.E. Sharp: 1998. p. xv. The novel was first serialised in the monthly magazine Gunzo between January–October 1964. It was published in hardcover format by Kodansha on 15 October 1964. It was translated into English in 1998 by Hiroaki Sato. Although a commercial failure, the novel was awarded the Mainichi Prize from Mainichi Shimbun. Publication Silk and Insight was first serialised ten times in the monthly magazine Gunzo between January 1964 and October 1964. It was published in hardcover format by Kodansha on 15 October 1964. It was published in paperback by Kodansha Bunko on 1 July 1971. The novel was a commercial failure, with only 18,000 copies published. In comparison, Mishima's novel Kyōko no Ie (1959) sold 150,000 copies in its first month. Translation Mishima originally intended for the novel to be translated into English by John Nathan, who Mishima first met in 1963. In 1965, Nathan translated Mishima's The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea. Impressed by Nathan's translation, Mishima requested Nathan sign on as his translator and help Mishima in his quest in being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Nathan was more interested in translating the work of Kenzaburō Ōe. Nathan initially agreed to translate Silk and Insight, but was unimpressed with it upon his first reading. He ultimately refused to translate the novel, opting instead to translate Kenzaburō Ōe's A Personal Matter. Mishima, who was considered an \\"arch-rival\\" of Ōe, abruptly severed ties with Nathan afterwards. Silk and Insight was later translated into English in 1998 by Hiroaki Sato and edited by Frank Gibney as the seventh volume in The Library of Japan series, produced by the Pacific Basin Institute at Pomona College.

Early life and education Hylleraas, the name of the farm where he was born, was the son of Ole Andersen, a teacher in the mountain village of Engerdal in southern Norway. Hylleraas was the youngest of eleven children. After elementary school he stayed home, performing duties such as chopping timber or watching the cattle up in the mountains during the summer. Only at the age of seventeen did he attend high- school and three years later he started studies at the University of Oslo. Upon leaving University he became a teacher who could not forget the many interesting problems he had learned about. Upon reading a book by Max Born, on crystal lattices, he started calculations on double refraction of light. Publications of this work provided him with a Fellowship from the International Education Board which he used to go and work with Max Born at the University of Göttingen in 1926–28. The Golden Age of Atomic Physics In his Reminiscences, Hylleraas referred to the period 1925–1930 as the Golden Age of atomic physics. It was a time when Bohr's theory of the atom was being replaced by the new quantum mechanics. By 1926, the one-electron hydrogen problem had been solved and Heisenberg had formulated the two-electron helium problem quantum mechanically but a simple first-order perturbation treatment yielded an ionization potential considerably in error with experimental measurement. Born considered it crucial for quantum mechanics to provide a result in much better agreement with experiment. When Hylleraas arrived in Göttingen he was disappointed to learn that Born had abandoned crystallography. At first, he continued his work on crystals on his own but when Bohr's student became ill, he was assigned the urgent task of working on the helium problem. Hylleraas modified the first attempt in two important ways: he replaced the incomplete bound-state hydrogenic functions by the complete Laguerre functions and reduced the number of co-ordinates from 6 to 3, namely the distances of the two electrons from the nucleus and the angle between the position vectors of the two electrons. Then, with the aid of a mechanical desk calculator obtained result in much better agreement with experiment. The result was well received but the discrepancy of 0.12 eV continued to bother him. Later in 1928, a breakthrough was achieved when he realized the angle co-ordinate should be replaced by the distance between the two electrons. With only three terms in the wave function expansion, the error had been reduced to 0.03 eV, with six terms to 0.01 eV. His work was quickly applied to other two-electron atoms and to the hydrogen molecule. Hylleraas was one of the founding fathers of CERN and represented Norway to the European Council for Nuclear Research, which later led into the establishment of the organization itself.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building, and it is now located within Chester Business Park. History The farm was built between 1877 and 1884 as a model farm. It was designed by the Chester architect John Douglas for the 1st Duke of Westminster on his Eaton Hall estate. The farmhouse is dated 1880. Douglas had carried out work on the Duke's other farms but this was his first complete farmstead, with the house and the buildings being designed together as a whole. The farm buildings include a barn, shippons, stables, carthouses, piggeries and a dovecote. The buildings are no longer used as a farm and have been converted into offices as part of the Chester Business Park. Architecture Wrexham Road Farmhouse in 2010 The farmhouse is built in brick with stone dressings and has two storeys plus attics. The entrance front faces south and has three bays. The central bay projects forwards and includes a doorway with a single-light window on each side. The other bays, on the ground floor, and all bays in the upper storey, have five-light mullioned windows. All three bays are surmounted by Dutch gables with ball finials. The gables in the lateral bays each contain a small two-light window; the central bay has an oval window. The west face of the farmhouse also has two Dutch gables and stone mullioned windows. The other two faces are plain. A covered passage links the house to the farm buildings. Together with the farmhouse, the farm buildings form a quadrangle. The buildings are in one and two storeys, built in brick, and have steep roofs. The entrance arch has a half-timbered upper storey. In the northeast corner of the farmyard is a dovecote surmounted by a spire. In 1888 Douglas submitted his design for this building and for Saighton Lane Farm at the Royal Academy. The authors of the Buildings of England express the opinion that this is \\"one of the most agreeable of all Douglas' model farms\\".

Biography W. Paul Thayer was born November 23, 1919, in Henryetta, Oklahoma and attended high school in Wichita, Kansas. After a high school, he attended Wichita State University, then spent a year working as an oil field roughneck, before enrolling at the University of Kansas, where he majored in petroleum engineering. During his time in college, he enrolled in the Civilian Pilot Training Program in order to train as a pilot. After college, Thayer entered the Naval Aviation Cadet Program in mid-1941, earning his wings as a naval aviator in March 1942. His posting in the United States Navy during World War II was with Fighter Squadron 26 (VF-26). Thayer flew a F4F Wildcat and became a flying ace, with six confirmed and four probable aerial victories, and nine further Japanese Air Force aircraft destroyed on the ground. He also participated in the sinking of a Japanese destroyer. Thayer honorably resigned from the navy as a lieutenant commander following the end of World War II. Immediately after leaving the Navy, Thayer worked as a transport pilot for Trans World Airlines for two years. He then joined the Chance Vought Aircraft Company as a test pilot in 1948. There, he rose rapidly through the ranks, becoming Chief Test Pilot in 1949, Flight Test Director, Vice President of Sales in 1951, and finally Company President in 1961. In 1968, he was awarded the James H. Doolittle Award. In 1965, the company was reorganized as Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV), and Thayer became president of LTV. In 1970, LTV Aerospace was in deep financial distress and Thayer took over as chief executive officer of LTV. Thayer managed to successfully turn the company around. Thayer was deeply involved in the business community in the 1970s, serving as president of the United States Chamber of Commerce and as a member of The Conference Board. On December 6, 1982, President of the United States Ronald Reagan nominated Thayer to be United States Deputy Secretary of Defense. After confirmation by the United States Senate, he was sworn in on January 12, 1983. He served as Deputy Secretary of Defense until January 4, 1984, when he resigned amid inquiries into charges of furnishing confidential stock market information, and was replaced by William Howard Taft IV. In June 1985, Thayer was sentenced to four years in prison for the obstructing justice during the insider trading case. Paul Thayer died on May 6, 2010. He is the father of actress Brynn Thayer.

Besides, over fifty villagers have been bitten by what locals claim is a single ‘ichchaadhaari’ (form-changing) snake. Sandhya's 18-year-old daughter died after being bitten by a snake when she had gone out to relieve herself. Another woman was bitten by a snake while out to gather firewood. Rattled by the rising snake bite incidents, villagers now fear going outdoors. Some even refuse to send their kids to school. Unable to find a solution, villagers have now turned to superstition to ‘pacify’ the ‘ichchaadhaari’ snake.

Due to the long history of the virus as well as its neurotropic nature, rabies has been a potent symbol of madness, irrationalism, or an unstoppable plague in numerous fictional works, in many genres. Many notable examples are listed below. Examples=In films (Chronological, then alphabetical within years) * The Lighthouse Keepers (1929), a film directed by Jean Grémillon, based on a play * Rabies (1958), a film directed by Ingmar Bergman * In the classic film Rage (1966), starring Glenn Ford and Stella Stevens, a doctor in rural Mexico is infected with rabies and desperately struggles to return to civilization and seek treatment.

If the defendant fulfills the stipulations surrounding probation, a judge may then throw out the sentence and guilty plea, clearing the incident from their record. If the defendant violates probation, he or she must serve the full sentence immediately. United States In the United States, a defendant must plead guilty to at least one of the crimes he or she is accused of in order to receive a deferred sentence. The promise of a deferred sentence is often traded in exchange for a guilty plea in plea bargains. Deferred sentences are often given to first time offenders, or to those who have committed relatively minor crimes, although ultimately, the choice to defer a sentence is left to a judge's discretion. New York In the state of New York, a similar process is known as adjournment in contemplation of dismissal (ACOD). What typically happens in such a case is that the potential sentence is deferred for six months, and if the defendant stays out of trouble, the charge is dropped entirely with no public record of the offense. A deferred sentence is not exactly the same as an ACOD. One of the primary differences is that receiving an ACOD doesn't require an admission of guilt or plea of guilty unlike a deferred sentence which requires such. Upon completion of the ACOD, the charges are automatically sealed, fingerprints & mugshots are destroyed, and the arrest is annulled. There is no conviction and all rights you had prior to arrest are restored. In order to enter the deferred sentence program, a plea of guilt must be made. Even though successful completion of a deferred sentence results in a dismissal of charges and guilty plea withdrawal, most states still consider it to be a conviction since a plea of guilt was entered and you were considered \\"convicted\\" for the duration of the program. Furthermore, completion of a deferred sentence program usually requires a request to the court to have the underlying charges and arrest sealed.

Although there has been a debate concerning whether it is an EP or LP, due to the few songs on the album, the band's members claim it is an LP album. It only contains five songs, all over the ten-minute-mark plus an intro. It was recorded over a weekend in a studio in a small garage, located in Kópavogur, right outside of Reykjavík, Iceland's capital, and mixed within a week in the same small studio. All the songs we recorded in one take, meaning that there were no overdubs and no second takes for any instrument. Kjartan Holm, and Guðfinnur Sveinsson, FaMR's guitarists and pianists said in an interview with a Belgian magazine once that this only gives the album some charm, they don't regret doing it this way. They have also revealed that the reason why the recordings were like this, was because they've landed a spot on their first Iceland Airwaves gig in 2007 and basically wanted to have something to sell. They managed to sell all the copies they brought with them to the gig that night.

The two leaders of the Iron Guard were killed in battle on the same day, January 13, 1937, at Majadahonda during the Spanish Civil War while fighting on the side of Francoist Spain. The funerary train took a tour around the country, with hundreds of thousands of people participating at the commemorations in many cities, holding holy services of the two at several cathedrals. In Bucharest, thousands of young legionnaires dressed in their green shirts marched on the streets of the city.Ilarion Țiu, \\"În zodia Satanei\\" , Jurnalul Național, August 18, 2008 The result of these displays was that the number of members grew threefold and the Iron Guard's party, Totul Pentru Țară, had an unexpectedly high percentage in the 1937 Romanian general election (15.58%), becoming the third largest party in Romania. Background The Iron Guard was originally a splinter from A. C. Cuza's antisemitic and nationalist National- Christian Defense League, forming around Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. The new group advocated action, \\"spiritual values\\" over economic ones, the creation of a \\"new man\\" and self-sacrifice as the key for the success of the movement.Săndulescu, p. 259-261 As the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, the Iron Guard, like much of the Romanian public opinion, saw it in a simple dichotomy: a fight between atheistic communism and Christianity, this point being made stronger by the news that some groups on the Republican side systematically persecuted members of the Catholic clergy and destroyed churches.Săndulescu, p. 261 Ion Moța, the second in command in the Legion, suggested that a number of leaders of the Iron Guard would go to Spain and present a gift (a Toledo sword) to Francoist General José Moscardó Ituarte, then fight alongside the Nationalist forces. They were involved in the battles near Madrid, and on January 13, 1937, at Majadahonda, Ion Moța and Vasile Marin were killed by an artillery shell.Săndulescu, p. 261-262 Funeral procession=Funerary train The bodies of the two members of the Legion were put in a mortuary train which left Spain, via France and then Belgium, reaching Berlin on February 6, 1937, where they were met by SS and SA squads, representatives of the German Nazi Party, of the Spanish Falange and of Fascist Italy as well as a big crowd.Săndulescu, p. 262Map showing the route taken by the funerary train across RomaniaAfter going through Poland, the February 9, the train reached the Romanian border, but instead of taking the shortest route to Bucharest, it made a detour by going through the whole country, from Bukovina to Moldavia, then Transylvania, Oltenia, Wallachia and finally reaching Bucharest.Săndulescu, p. 263 The train stopped at the major railway stations and in each of them, a religious service was performed, with huge crowds watching and then, the Iron Guard leaders urged the audience to join their \\"Legionary faith\\". In Pașcani, over 5000 peasants gathered to see the mortuary wagon, while in Bacău, a group of 30 priests performed the services in front of a crowd.Săndulescu, p. 264 In Transylvania, the most important stop was in Cluj, where many local politicians and intellectuals participated at the commemoration, including Alexandru Vaida-Voievod, Sextil Pușcariu, Emil Hațiegan and Ioan Lupaș. The service was held by Bishop Nicolae Colan, who praised the struggle of Moța and Marin against the \\"red madness\\". Ion Agârbiceanu held a speech in the name of the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church. Great crowds also gathered in Orăștie, Moța's native town and Sibiu, where 32 priests conducted the religious rituals. After crossing the Carpathians, the train went through Oltenia and Wallachia (where it made a notable stop in Pitești), reaching Bucharest's Gara de Nord station in the morning of February 11, 1937.  Funeral procession in Bucharest  It was in Bucharest that the biggest procession took place: as the government lifted the ban of wearing uniforms in public places, thousands of Legionnaires wearing their green uniforms waited for the coffins in front of the railway station. Further tens of thousands of Bucharesters were just sympathisers or simply bystanders who watched the procession and followed it through the city. In addition, a big number of Romanian politicians, professors and students, as well as diplomatic staffs from Italy, Germany and Spain, as well as representatives of the Fascist parties in these countries were present. After a short religious service, in front of the coffins, the Legionnaires performed the \\"Ion Moța and Vasile Marin Oath\\", an oath written by the leader of the Iron Guard, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. In this oath, they swore that they are \\"ready for death at any time\\".Săndulescu, p. 265 The procession marched toward Saint Ilie-Gorgani Church in central Bucharest, where the bodies were to be kept until their burial. The funeral procession was led by some Iron Guard members who carried the crosses of the two fighters, followed by students, representatives of Hitler, Mussolini and Franco, a large number of priests and a Legionary formation in the shape of a cross. Burial Moța and Marin were interred on February 13, 1937, next to the Headquarters of the movement, the \\"Green House\\" (Casa Verde), in a mausoleum specially-built, a decision made by Codreanu in order to inspire the future Legionnaires. The religious services were held by a number of between 200 and 400 priests. Five surviving Legionnaires who fought in Spain took a part in the next part of the procession. Pedro de Prat y Soutzo, the Nationalist Spain's diplomatic representative called the names of those in the legionnaire squad, and for Moța and Marin, everyone answered \\"Present!\\". A similar roll call was found in other fascist movements, too; for example it was the focal point in the 1932 Garibaldian Celebrations, in Mussolini's Italy.Săndulescu, p. 265-266 Reactions=Press One of the most influential newspapers, Universul, provided ample updates on the commemoration of the two throughout the country. Even so, the students who were members of the Iron Guard accused the newspaper of not doing enough to support the Legion's activity in Spain, while the director of the newspaper defended himself by saying that more is not possible to do because of the state censorship. Left-wing newspapers like Adevărul and Dimineața chose to ignore the event to prevent it from gaining more public attention. Politicians Many of the right-wing politicians, whether members of the Iron Guard or other rival parties, paid their respects to the death of the two fighters. Nicolae Iorga wrote a laudative article called \\"Two brave boys\\" in which the two were praised for fighting for the Christian faith, although weeks later, he condemned the rituals of the Legion, including the usage of a pagan symbol, the swastika. Gheorghe I. Brătianu, the leader of National Liberal Party-Brătianu, a splinter group of the National Liberal Party, also paid respects to the two Iron Guard members, calling Moța one of the \\"most capable and honest fighters from the Legionary ranks\\". Popular opinion The Romanian public generally sympathised with the cause of Moța and Marin, because their struggle in Spain was depicted as being part of a fight between communist atheism and Christianity. Many bystanders and non- partisans were impressed by the mystical rituals of the Iron Guard.Săndulescu, p. 266 The Church showed a very vigorous support for the movement, conducting religious services across the country and bishops openly praising Moța and Marin in their speeches.Săndulescu, p. 267 Legacy Before the deaths, the ideology of \\"self-sacrifice\\" of the Iron Guard was often seen as mere rhetoric, but now, the Legionary movement was able to argue that it has created the \\"new man\\" that was able to give one's life for the ideological goals. The funerals made the cause of the Iron Guard better known and from January 1937 to the end of the year, the number of members of the Legion grew from 96,000 to 272,000. The popularity of the Iron Guard was shown in the December 1937 elections, when it was able to gain 15.5% of the votes, becoming the third largest party in the Romanian Parliament. The movement was eventually repressed by Carol II's royal dictatorship regime and its revolutionary fascist project failed. Nevertheless, this burial remains as a political manifestation of a size that was not found elsewhere in Romanian history.

It has been referred to as the Impossible Black Tulip of Cartography, \\"because of its rarity, importance and exoticism\\". The map was crucial in expanding Chinese knowledge of the world. It was eventually exported to Korea. then Japan and was influential there as well,Japan and China: mutual representations in the modern era Wataru Masuda p.17 though less so than Alenio's Zhifang Waiji. Description Unattributed (1604?), two page colored Japanese copy of the 1602 map Pseudocylindrical Eckert IV map projection, 1906, resembling the 1602 Ricci map The 1602 Ricci map is a very large, high and wide, woodcut using a pseudocylindrical map projection showing China at the center of the known world. The 1906 Eckert IV map resembles the display of this Chinese map. It is the first map in Chinese to show the Americas. The map's mirror image originally was carved on six large blocks of wood and then printed in brownish ink on six mulberry paper panels, similar to the making of a folding screen. It portrays both North and South America and the Pacific Ocean with reasonable accuracy. China appropriately is linked to Asia, India, and the Middle East. Europe, the Mediterranean, and Africa also are well delineated. Diane Neimann, a trustee of the James Ford Bell Trust, notes that: \\"There is some distortion, but what's on the map is the result of commerce, trade and exploration, so one has a good sense of what was known then.\\" Ti Bin Zhang, first secretary for cultural affairs at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., said in 2009: \\"The map represents the momentous first meeting of East and West\\" and was the \\"catalyst for commerce.\\" Details Small scale north polar projection world map at the top of the first left panel of 1602 Ricci map 1609 Shanhai Yudi Quantu (not by Ricci) 1620s Giulio Aleni world map Wanguo Quantu (萬國全圖),Wigal, p.202 1674 Kunyu Quantu of Ferdinand Verbiest 2 hemispheres 1674 Kunyu Quantu by Ferdinand Verbiest 1 hemisphere (very detailed) James Ford Bell Library copy of 1602 Ricci map Museo della Specola, Bologna copy, panels 1 and 6 (left & right) The map includes images and annotations describing different regions of the world. Africa is noted to have the world's highest mountain and longest river. The brief description of North America mentions \\"humped oxen\\" or bison (駝峰牛 tuófēngníu), feral horses (野馬, yěmǎ), and names Canada (加拿大, Jiānádà). The map identifies Florida as Huādì (花地), the \\"Land of Flowers.\\" Several Central and South American places are named, including Guatemala (哇的麻剌, Wādemálá), Yucatan (宇革堂, Yǔgétáng), and Chile (智里, Zhīlǐ). The map's cartographer, Matteo Ricci, gave a brief description of the discovery of the Americas. \\"In olden days, nobody had ever known that there were such places as North and South America or Magellanica (using a name that early mapmakers gave to a supposed continent including Australia, Antarctica, and Tierra del Fuego), but a hundred years ago, Europeans came sailing in their ships to parts of the sea coast, and so discovered them.\\" The Museo della Specola Bologna has in its collection, displayed on the wall of the Globe Room, original copies of panels 1 and 6 of the six panels comprising the 1602 Ricci map. During restoration and mounting, a central panel—a part of the Doppio Emisfero delle Stelle by the German mathematician and astronomer Johann Adam Schall von Bell—was inserted between the two sections by mistake. In 1958, Pasquale D’Elia, sinologist at the University of Rome certified the authenticity of the Chinese maps in this museum’s possession, (see op. cit.) stating that \\"it is the third edition of a geographical and cartographical work that made Ricci famous throughout China. He had already made a first edition in 1584 at Shiuhing, followed by a second in 1600 at Nanking, and two years later a third in Peking. In 1938, an exhaustive work by Pasquale d'Elia, edited by the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, was published with comments, notes, and translation of the whole map. The maps carry plentiful instructions for use and detailed illustrations of the instruments that went into their production, as well as explanations regarding conceptions of \\"systems of the terrestrial and celestial world\\". There is a long preface by Matteo Ricci in the middle of the map, where it depicts the Pacific Ocean. D’Elia’s translation reads: The figure of the Nove Cieli (Nine Skies) is printed to the left of the title, illustrated as per sixteenth-century conceptions. The accompanying inscription explains the movement of the planets. The right-hand section (panel 6) has other inscriptions giving general ideas on geography and oceanography. Another inscription records an extract of the Storia dei Mongoli regarding the motions of the Sun. In the top of the left-hand section (panel 1), there is an explanation of eclipses and the method for measuring the Earth and the Moon. Both sections carry the characteristic Jesuit seal, the IHS of the Society of Jesus. At the bottom left, in the Southern Hemisphere, is the name of the Chinese publisher of the map and the date: one day of the first month of autumn in the year 1602. The map also incorporates an explanation of parallels and meridians, a proof that the sun is larger than the moon, a table showing the distances of planets from the earth, an explanation of the varying lengths of days and nights, and polar projections of the earth that are unusually consistent with its main map. History Matteo Ricci (1552–1610) was a Jesuit priest. Ricci was one of the first Western scholars to live in China and he became a master of Chinese script and the Classical Chinese language. In 1583, Ricci was among the first Jesuits to enter China from Macao. The first Chinese world map was named Yudi Shanhai Quantu (輿地山海全圖) and made in Zhaoqing in 1584 by Matteo Ricci with Chinese collaborators. Ricci had a small Italian wall map in his possession and created Chinese versions of it at the request of the governor of Zhaoqing at the time, Wang Pan, who wanted the document to serve as a resource for explorers and scholars. On January 24, 1601, Ricci was the first Jesuit - and one of the first Westerners - to enter the Ming capital Beijing, bringing atlases of Europe and the West that were unknown to his hosts. The Chinese had maps of the East that were equally unfamiliar to Western scholars. In 1602, at the request of the Wanli Emperor, Ricci collaborated with Mandarin Zhong Wentao, a technical translator, Li Zhizao, and other Chinese scholars in Beijing to create what was his third and largest world map, the Kunyu Wanguo Quantu. In this map, European geographic knowledge, new to the Chinese, was combined with Chinese information unknown to Europeans to create the first map known to combine Chinese and European cartography. Among other things, this map revealed the existence of America to the Chinese. Ford W. Bell said: \\"This was a great collaboration between East and West. It really is a very clear example of how trade was a driving force behind the spread of civilization.\\" According to John D. Day,John D. Day, “The Search for the Origins of the Chinese Manuscripts of Matteo Ricci’s Maps”, Imago Mundi 47 (1995), pp. 94–117 Matteo Ricci prepared four editions of Chinese world maps during his mission in China before 1603: # a 1584 early woodblock print made in Zhaoqing, called Yudi Shanhai Quantu; # a 1596 map carved on a stele, called Shanhai Yudi Tu (山海輿地圖); # a 1600 revised version of the 1596, usually named Shanhai Yudi Quantu (山海輿地全圖), engraved by Wu Zhongming; # a 1602 larger and much refined edition of the 1584 map, in six panels, printed in Beijing, called Kunyu Wanguo Quantu;“Kao Li Madou de shijie ditu”, p. 28 Several prints of the Kunyu Wanguo Quantu were made in 1602. Most of the original maps now are lost. Only six original copies of the map are known to exist, and only two are in good condition. Known copies are in the Vatican Apostolic Library Collection I and at the James Ford Bell Library at the University of Minnesota. The Vatican's 1602 copy was reproduced by Pasquale d’Elia in the beautifully arranged book, Il mappamondo cinese del P Matteo Ricci, S.I. in 1938. This modern work also contains Italian translations of the colophons on the map, a catalogue of all toponyms, plus detailed notes regarding their identification.Mappamondo. For earlier English translations of some of the colophons, see, for example, Lionel Giles, “Translations from the Chinese World Map of Father Ricci”, Geographical Journal 52 (1918), pp. 367–385; and 53 (1919), pp. 19–30. Other copies of the 1602 map are located at: Japan, Kyoto University Collection; collection of Japan Miyagi Prefecture Library; Collection of the Library of the Japanese Cabinet; and a private collection in Paris, France. No original examples of the map are known to exist in China, where Ricci was revered and buried. The maps received widespread attention and circulation. The governor General of Guizhou reproduced a copy of the map in a book about Guizhou published in Guiyang in 1604. Ricci estimated that more than 1,000 copies of the 1602 edition were reprinted. Various versions of the map were exported to Korea and later Japan. The first Korean copy was brought back from Beijing by visiting ambassadors in 1603. An unattributed and very detailed two page coloured edition of the map, known in Japanese as Konyo Bankoku Zenzu, was made in Japan circa 1604. Within this Japanese export copy, Japanese Katakana is utilised for foreign location names throughout the Western world. The Gonyeomangukjeondo (Hangul: 곤여만국전도) is a Korean hand-copied reproduction print by Painter Kim Jin-yeo in 1708, the 34th year of King Sukjong's rule of Joseon. It shows Kunyu Wanguo Quantu (Complete Map of the World) measuring 533×170 cm on mulberry paper. This map, representing the world in an ellipse, was brought to Korea in the 36th year of King Seonjo's rule (1710) by Lee Gwan-jeong and Gwon Hui, two envoys of Joseon to China. It is owned and displayed at Seoul National University Museum, San 56-1, Sillim-dong, Gwanak- gu, Seoul, Korea and was designated National Treasure No.849 on August 9, 1985. The map shows five world continents and over 850 toponyms. It contains descriptions of ethnic groups and main products associated with each region. In the margins outside the ellipse, there are images of the northern and southern hemispheres, the Aristotelian geocentric world system, and the orbits of the sun and moon. It has an introduction by Choe Seok-jeong providing information on the constitution of the map and its production process. This reproduction map provides a clear testimony to the national interest in western maps in 17th-century Korea. It is a highly esthetic piece of work and one of the most beautiful maps produced during the Joseon period. Bell Library copy The James Ford Bell Trust announced in December 2009 that it had acquired one of two good copies of the 1602 Ricci map from the firm of Bernard J. Shapero, a noted dealer of rare books and maps in London, for US$1 million, the second most expensive map purchase in history. This copy had been held for years by a private collector in Japan. Ford W. Bell, president of the American Association of Museums (now the American Alliance of Museums) and a trustee of the James Ford Bell Trust started by his grandfather, James Ford Bell, the founder of General Mills, said in an interview with a reporter from Minnesota Public Radio's All Things Considered: \\"These opportunities don't present themselves very often. This map was the only one on the market, and the only one likely to be on the market. So we had to take advantage of that opportunity.\\" The map was displayed for the first time in North America at the Library of Congress from January through April, 2010. It was scanned by the Library of Congress Geography and Map Division to create a permanent digital image that will be posted on the internet later in 2010 in the World Digital Library for scholars and students to study. The map was then exhibited briefly at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, before moving to its permanent home at the James Ford Bell Library at the University of Minnesota, where it will be on display beginning September 15, 2010. Chinese maps published after 1602 Before his death at Peking in 1610, Matteo Ricci prepared four more world maps after the 1602 one: :5. a 1603 eight panel version of the 1602 map, usually named Liangyi Xuanlan Tu (兩儀玄覽圖) (Map for the far-reaching observation of heaven and earth). The 1603 edition is larger than the 1602, but is less well known because of the fewer extant copies and versions based on it; :6. a 1604 booklet based on the map of 1600, also named Shanhai Yudi Quantu; engraved by Guo Zizhang (郭子章); :7. a new 1608 version, twelve copies presented to the emperor :8. and a 1609 map in two hemispheres. Most of these maps now are lost. Later copies of the 1602 edition of the Kunyu Wanguo Quantu may be found in China, Korea, London, and Vienna;A reproduction of the Vienna map can be found in Österreichisch Nationalbibliothek (1995).Kartographische Zimelien. Die 50 schönsten Karten und Globen der Österreichischen Nationalbibliothek. Wien: Holzhausen. one copy of the map recently was discovered in the store- rooms of the Shenyang Museum in China. A world search is currently in progress by Kendall Whaling Museum of Massachusetts. Hong Weilian, earlier established a list of twelve total Ricci maps, which differs considerably from Day’s findings. In 1607 or 1609 the Shanhai Yudi Quantu, is a Chinese map which was published in the geographical treatise Sancai Tuhui. The Shanhai Yudi Quantu was influenced highly by the work of Matteo Ricci.Ptak, p.1 Matteo Ricci had several of his own maps entitled Shanhai Yudi Quantu.Ptak, p.3 The locations in the map have been identified and translated by Roderich Ptak in his work, The Sino-European Map (“Shanhai yudi quantu”), in the Encyclopedia Sancai tuhui: About 1620 Giulio Aleni made the world map Wanguo Quantu (萬國全圖, lit. \\"Complete map of all the countries\\"), putting China at the center of the world map, following Ricci's format and contents, but in a much smaller size (49 cm x 24 cm). This map was included in some editions of Aleni's geographical work, Zhifang waiji. (Descriptions of Foreign Land) His 1623 preface states that another Jesuit, Diego de Pantoja (1571–1618), on the command of the emperor, had translated a different European map, also following Ricci's model, but there is no other knowledge of that work. In 1633, the Jesuit, Francesco Sambiasi (1582–1649), composed and annotated another world map, entitled Kunyu Quantu (Universal Map of the World), in Nanjing. In 1674, Ferdinand Verbiest developed the Kunyu Quantu, a similar map, but with various improvements. It consists of eight panels, each 179 cm x 54 cm, together displaying two hemispheres in Mercator projection. The two outer scrolls individually depict cartouches that contain several kinds of information on geography and meteorology. The making of Verbiest's Kunyu Quantu was intended to meet the interest of the Kangxi Emperor, as Verbiest's introductory dedication implies. There currently are at least fourteen or fifteen copies and editions of this map known in Europe, Japan, Taiwan, America, and Australia. Religious significance Chen, Hui-hung discussed the religious meaning of the world maps that were produced by Jesuit missionaries in China from the late sixteenth to the seventeenth centuries. These world maps serve as a visual proof to emphasize the greatness of the world and the minuscule nature of humans. Through these maps people \\"can see\\" the truth of God because of the visual ability granted via God's omnipotence. Jesuit cartography was not only a visual image of geographical configuration: it paved the way for the comprehension of what they expressed as the Creator's significance. It was an embodiment of the Renaissance tradition of cartography as the graphical representation of the universe. This includes the idea of understanding nature through mathematical science as well as understanding Heaven by visualization and sensibility. In this Renaissance tradition, geography was associated with cosmology that was based upon Christian theology. These maps expressed Aristotle's sensibility toward comprehension of the universe, which formed the core of Catholic epistemology and natural philosophy. The religious implications of Jesuit cartography in China are part of how the Jesuits used their cartographic superiority strategically in their evangelization. Ricci was a Jesuit priest whose mission was to convert the Chinese to Roman Catholicism. He thought that might be helped by demonstrating the superior understanding of the world that he believed grew out of Christian faith. The map’s text shows it as part of a diplomatic attempt by Ricci to affirm the greatness of his own religion and culture. Ricci declares that it offers testimony “to the supreme goodness, greatness and unity of Him who controls heaven and earth.”  Gallery  File:Ricci map 1602.jpgunknown edition or poor copy of 1602 Ricci map File:Wanguo Quantu.jpg1620s Wanguo Quantu map, by Giulio Aleni, whose Chinese name (艾儒略) appears in the signature in the last column on the left, above the Jesuit IHS symbol.Vatican exhibit File:Impossible Black Tulip-World map, Gulf of Mexico, Florida.jpg1602 Ricci map - detail of Gulf of Mexico, Florida, Cuba, Yucatan, Mexico File: Impossible_Black_Tulip-_World_map,_detail_from_the_China_section.jpg1602 Ricci map - detail from a China panel File: Ricci1602North&CentralAmerica.jpg;1602 Ricci map - detail of North and Central America File: Matteo Ricci Far East 1602 Larger.jpgDetail of China and Far East, from the 1604 copy  References External links * The \\"Great Universal Geographic Map\\" at the World Digital Library. * \\"Opere Di Matteo Ricci\\" [\\"The works of Matteo Ricci\\"], including descriptions of the six editions of Ricci's world map, by Alfredo Maulo * Audio – MPR's Tom Crann talks with Ford W.

The company was founded in 1915 and purchased by the Midland- Ross Corporation (a steel manufacturer) in 1959. Midland-Ross was acquired by the private equity investment firm of Forstmann Little & Company in 1986, which spun off Surface Combustion to four long term employees in 1987. It was later sold to the Bernard family in 1999. The company has been called \\"the IBM of the automotive industry\\" due to its prominence in providing equipment used to heat-treat automobiles parts. History=Early years Surface combustion is an engineering term which refers to process whereby a gaseous fuel is premixed with enough oxygen so that both the fuel and the oxygen are nearly completely used up. Some time prior to 1913, natural gas salesman Henry O. Loebell incorporated the Improved Appliance Company, which manufactured industrial furnaces. Taking advantage of recent advances in combustion research, Loebell changed the name of his corporation to Surface Combustion Corporation in 1915 and expanded into natural gas burning generators and industrial combustion systems. The firm was initially headquartered in The Bronx, New York, but in October 1924 oil industry executive Henry L. Doherty purchased Surface Combustion and merged it with his own natural gas industrial appliance company, Combustion Utilities Corp., under the name Henry L. Doherty & Co. Doherty moved the company's headquarters to Toledo, Ohio, in 1928, where he believed the company would thrive due to a closer proximity to the Midwest's manufacturing centers and easy access to the large number of engineers being produced by the region's colleges and universities. In 1930, Surface Combustion purchased the Chapman-Stein Company, a subsidiary of the C.J. Cooper-Bessemer Company of Ohio Cooper Bessemer and the Columbus Heating and Ventilating Company, a manufacturer of industrial and consumer gas heating and cooling equipment. In 1927, Surface Combustion introduced the Janitrol brand of home heating and cooling appliances. By 1940, Janitrol had expanded into the aircraft and aerospace industries, providing small, self-contained petroleum- and gas-powered heating, de-icing, and other units. By the late 1950s, Janitrol was providing heat-treating equipment for missiles and space launch vehicles as well as military and civilian aircraft, in addition to its aerospace and aircraft heating and cooling units. Midland-Ross years In November 1959, steel manufacturer Midland-Ross Corporation bought Surface Combustion for $23 million. Midland-Ross purchased the Fandaire division of Yuba Consolidated Industries in February 1962 and merged it with Surface Combustion. In April 1969, Midland-Ross sold Surface Combustion's Janitrol and Webster divisions to Laird, Inc. The sale did not include the Janitrol Aero division, which was retained by Surface Combustion. In the 1970s, Surface Combustion began developing furnaces for the destruction of chemical weapons under a contract awarded by Edgewood Arsenal. Surface Combustion's business began to suffer after the late 1970s as orders for heat-treated metal products, heating equipment, and cooling equipment fell during the early 1980s recession. Forstmann, Little years On July 1, 1986, the private investment firm Forstmann Little & Company acquired Midland-Ross for $450 million. By this time, Surface Combustion owned more than 500 patents and had installed about 250,000 heat-treating and industrial furnace appliances worldwide. Forstmann, Little did not retain control of Surface Combustion for long. In 1987, the investment firm sold Surface Combustion to a consortium consisting of Surface Combustion management. The sale did not include Surface Combustion's Janitrol Aero division, which Forstmann, Little retained as part of its FL Aerospace Corporation. Independence again Surface Combustion moved into a headquarters in Maumee, Ohio, in 1988. At the time the company was spun off from Forstmann, Little, it had about 150 employees—about 20 of which worked on research and development. It opened a new factory for the manufacture of heat-treating equipment and furnaces in Waterville, Ohio, in 1991. As an independent firm, Surface Combustion grew swiftly. It moved into another new headquarters, in size, in 1990. In 2004 and again in 2010, the company won contracts to produce furnaces and decontamination devices for chemical weapons.; About the firm As of 2015, Surface Combustion, Inc. primarily manufactured industrial furnaces and equipment to heat-treat metal products. Its equipment was used in the automotive, energy production, farming, and mining industries. Some of the equipment is purpose-designed, and requires on-site assembly. The company had about 100 employees and annual sales of $40 million to $50 million. It sold equipment in 40 to 50 countries, and owned more than 675 patents. Tim Levy, president of Industrial Steel Treating, has called Surface Combustion \\"the IBM\\" of automobile manufacturing for the critical role their heat-treating equipment plays in the industry. Products Surface Combustion manufactures equipment for various thermal processes including carburizing, annealing, vacuum processing, tempering, nitriding, and quenching, among others utilized for batch production or continuous production. * Allcase (batch integral quench furnace) – A furnace patented by Surface Combustion, and typically used in batch carburizing processes. * RX Generator (endothermic gas generator) – A furnace which produces a carbon-carrying gas used in the carburizing process. * DX Generator (exothermic gas generator) – A furnace which produces a gas that can be used in several different applications. * VringCARB - A high-purity vacuum carburizing technology using cyclohexane. * MPF (Metal Parts Furnace) - A furnace said to destroy chemical weapons. * Roller hearths and pusher furnaces - Products utilized in continuous production for a variety of thermal processes.

In 1949 the pacifist Peace Pledge Union (PPU) responded to its relative inertia and to calls for more action by holding a conference on 5 November, which led to the establishment of seven “Commissions” to explore the best ways of moving forward. One of these was the Nonviolence Commission. Members of the commission took it upon themselves to explore the question of civil disobedience.PPU Journal 44, December 1949 Subsequently, at the beginning of 1952, many members of the commission dissatisfied with a lack of action formed a ginger group, not formally affiliated to the PPU, initially known as Operation Gandhi, and then as the Nonviolent Resistance Group. The PPU had been interested in the teachings of Gandhi and the possibility of translating them into actions in the United Kingdom. Between 1936, when Peace News was founded, and 1957, it had almost 350 articles on related topics. Scalmer, Sean. 2002. 'The Labour of Diffusion: The Peace Pledge Union and the Adaptation of the Gandhian Repertoire', Mobilization: An International Journal, vol. 7: 269-86. However, within the PPU there was significant opposition to the concept of civil disobedience. At the end of 1951 Hugh Brock, who subsequently became editor of Peace News, proposed the formation of Operation Gandhi, for which he had already drawn up a plan of action.Nonviolence commission of the PPU, Minutes of 12 December 1951. Its activities began with a sit-down outside the War Office on 11 January 1952. Eleven protesters squatted in front of the War Office, having first notified the police. Following principles of nonviolence, the protesters did not resist arrest, and in court pleaded guilty to charges of obstructing the police. Sean Scalmer ”Globalising Gandhi: Translation, Reinvention, Application, Transformation” Borderlands Vol 4 No 3, , quoting Peace News. There were other protests at Aldermaston, Mildenhall, Porton Down and the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. The protest march to Aldermaston in 1952 involved just 35 people and paved the way for the much larger Aldermaston Marches begun by the Direct Action Committee against nuclear war in 1958 and continued by CND. Brock, Hugh, \\"Marching to Aldermaston - ten years ago!\\", Sanity, Good Friday, 1962 Indeed, Operation Gandhi can be said to have paved the way for all subsequent nonviolent direct action in the UK, including protests against nuclear weapons by the Direct Action Committee, by the Committee of 100 and by others. Operation Gandhi did not last long. It changed its name to the Nonviolent Resistance Group, and by 1954 had been re-absorbed into the PPU's Nonviolence Commission.

History The Pucci family commissioned it as the altarpiece for the family chapel, the oratory dedicated to Saint Sebastian in the church of Santissima Annunziata, Florence. Giorgio Vasari dates it to 1475 but misattributes it to Piero's brother, the more famous and artistically talented Antonio – a misattribution that lasted until the present day. Roberto Pucci withdrew the work from the oratory on the pretext of restoration but then in 1857 sold it to the National Gallery. Analysis It is considered Piero's masterpiece, with a more rigid geometric control on the composition than in his previous works, without giving up his usual naturalness of poses and movement – the four archers in the foreground form two symmetrical poses, with the two central ones reloading and the two on the edges firing, in perfect equilibrium either side of the central post to which Sebastian is tied. It can be contrasted with its near-contemporary, the Saint Sebastian by Botticelli, which instead puts the figure of the saint in isolation in a Flemish-inspired landscape. Borrowed from the Botticelli painting is the San Sebastiano by Francesco Botticini, formerly attributed to Andrea del Castagno, dated to the years immediately after 1474.

O'Donnell (May 11, 1909, Milwaukee - 1986) was the President of Marquette University from 1948 to 1962. Biography Edward O'Donnell was the eldest of seven children. He grew up in the Tory Hill neighborhood and attended Gesu Catholic School. He entered the Academy in 1923 with plans to become an attorney. O'Donnell graduated from Marquette University in 1931. That same year he entered the Jesuit order. After his studies, he taught and worked in the missions of Central America and was ordained in 1942. Upon the sudden death of Fr. Peter Brooks, S.J., O'Donnell returned in 1948 to become Marquette's President, making him the University's youngest President. He served until 1962. During his tenure, Marquette advanced its reputation as one of the leading Catholic universities in America. Enrollment more than doubled to 12,000 students, while the campus expanded significantly. The \\"Greater Marquette Campaign\\" featured both capital and program priorities. O'Donnell initiated the construction of several important campus buildings dedicated to the instruction and housing of undergraduates. These buildings included the Business Administration school building (1951), the Memorial Library (1953) and the Brooks Memorial Union (1953). The Medical and Dental Schools were expanded to meet the needs of the growing interest in the health care fields. In addition, new student housing was constructed to meet the demands of the expanding undergraduate population. In 1952, O'Donnell Hall, Marquette's first all female dormitory opened on the upper campus. Schroeder Hall followed in 1957. Unfortunately, one of the casualties of the building program was the University football team which ceased competition in 1960 due to cost factors. After his retirement, Fr. O'Donnell assisted Rev. John Raynor, S.J. as the University's chancellor. He retired from that role in 1972. He left Marquette for St. John's College, Belize, where he had led the teacher training program during World War II. While there he concentrated on parish work. Poor health forced him to return to Milwaukee. He died at the Marquette University Jesuit Residence in 1986.*EdwardJ. O'Donnell obituary, The New York Times, July 2, 1986.

From Goslar and Bad Harzburg on the northern edge of the Harz it runs across the Harz to Walkenried in the south; and then via Nordhausen to Tilleda on the Kyffhäuser.  Route  Kaiserpfalz Goslar - Oker - Bad Harzburg - Molkenhaus - Königskrug - Kapellenfleck - Helenenruh - Walkenried - Ellrich - Kammerforst - Woffleben - Komödienplatz - Salza - Nordhausen - Heringen - Hamma - Badra - Kyffhäusergebirge - Königspfalz Tilleda. The starting point for the Kaiser Way depends on one's interpretation. One view sees the Kaiser Way beginning as one of the \\"Ways of the German Emperors and Empresses of the Middle Ages in the Harz\\" (Wege Deutscher Kaiser and Könige des Mittelalters in the Harz) at the Kaiserpfalz Goslar and running along the northern perimeter of the Harz, initially in an easterly direction, via Oker to Bad Harzburg. Here is where the real Kaiser Way begins! From Bad Harzburg it climbs southwards into the Harz National Park (Harzquerung) via Molkenhaus to Königskrug, then descends to Walkenried on the southern edge of the Harz; it therefore crosses the Harz on its north-south axis, keeping to the mountain ridges and avoiding the valleys and then runs along the southern edge of the Harz from Lower Saxony into Thuringia. Via Ellrich, the Kammerforst and Woffleben it then continues east to Nordhausen. From there it passes through the Goldene Aue (Heringen - Hamma - Badra) to the Kyffhäuser. It crosses the heights - the walker switching from Thuringia (KYF) to Saxony-Anhalt (SGH and MSH) - and reaches the \\"village of a thousand souls\\", Tilleda, and Königspfalz on the other side of this small range of hills. The Kaiser Way thus runs through three federal states: Lower Saxony - Thuringia - Saxony-Anhalt, and also through several rural districts: Goslar (GS) - Göttingen (GÖ) - Nordhausen (NDH) - Kyffhäuserkreis (KYF) - Sangerhausen (SGH, today Mansfeld-Südharz MSH). This is the actual route of the Kaiser Way, a \\"old trade route over the Harz, named after the flight of Emperor Henry IV from his Harzburg Castle to the shelter of abbeys in the South Harz and to Tilleda in the year 1074\\". Despite that, there is also a bigger network of paths in the East Harz which goes by the name \\"Ways of the German Emperors and Empresses of the Middle Ages in the Harz\\" and also bears the imperial crown, but should not be referred to as the Kaiser Way.  Description  This thematic footpath runs along an old, historic trail – the Kaiser Way. Until around the start of the 21st century, the few routes over the Harz were only steep footpaths, like the Weidenstieg and the Salzstieg. The footpath, bridleway and, later, drive, that is most steeped in history is the Kaiser Way. As a 'high way' it followed the heights and avoided the deepest valleys, so that travellers expended the least possible amount of effort as they crossed the Harz. The way ran immediately past the Achtermann, at the fourth highest mountain in the Harz after the Brocken, Wurmberg and Bruchberg. The condition of the route is extremely varied and changeable. For example, in the National Park it is often a wide and well signed gravel path. In the South Harz and in Thuringia, where visitor congestion is less, the walker often has to negotiate poorly maintained paths. The path has tarmac, gravel and cobblestone sections as well as forest and field tracks of course stones, mud or sand, as well as sections through villages and towns.  History  There were definite footpaths here even in prehistoric times, as can be deduced from the significant amount of Stone Age finds along the route. In 744, the army of the Frankish major domo (Hausmeier) Pippin the Younger moved down this route. Many great armies, but also goods of every sort, especially ore from the Rammelsberg, from Altenau and the Spitzberg were transported over the Harz on this route. The majority of the Kaiser Way is identical with the former Heidenstieg, which was called a via (road) in 1258. The Kaiser Way derived its name from the successful escape of Emperor Henry IV in the night of 8/9 August 1073 from the Saxons. He fled from his castle on the Burgberg near Bad Harzburg via Walkenried and Ellrich to Eschwege on the River Werra. Later Henry the Lion in the year 1180, King Philip of Swabia 1200, Emperor Otto IV 1206/1208 and Emperor Frederick II, in the year 1219 took the same route over the Harz for their armies. The way was never in a good condition. True, granite slabs, erratics and tree trunks were used to overcome the largest potholes, but as anything lost along the way belonged by right to the land lords, they were more interested in maintaining the poor condition of the route. All goods had to be transferred, whilst in the lowlands, from four-wheeled covered wagons to two-wheeled 'Harz carts' (Harzkarren), normally used for transporting ore. Each cart was hauled by six to eight, or even more horses over the Harz. Deep ruts in the granite slabs between Königskrug and Oderbrück still bear witness today to this harsh chapter in the history of the Kaiserweg. From 1899 to 1962, a railway halt on the South Harz Railway (Braunlage–Walkenried) called Kaiserweg was situated at the crossing of the path with the Landstraße from Wieda to Braunlage. Until 1963 wood was loaded here.

The theater changed its direction and began to focus attention on classical works in the 1990s. left On January 18, 2019, Stas Zhyrkov and Tamara Trunova became theater directors. The new team began the process of reformation and upgrading. Theater left in the repertoire classical drama performances, and start to supplement performances of original, actual texts on acute-social topics. Today, Left Bank Theater has more than 50 performances in the repertoire, including physical theatre and modern comedy del arte play. The Kyiv State Drama and Comedy Theater on the Left Bank toured in Georgia, Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, Poland; always has participated in international theatrical festivals and has become one of the best Ukrainian theater for 40 years of history.

This highly important art institution functions based on the 'Law of Museums' and the 'Law of Art and Culture' of Albania. The beginnings of the institution can be traced back to the endeavors of a group of Albanian artists and the Arts Committee of 1946. Pinakoteka was the first institution of fine arts in the country. After much toil and extensive efforts, the Gallery of Arts officially opened to the public in Tirana on 11 January 1954. The gallery worked in two main directions: exhibiting the permanent collection and opening temporary exhibitions of Albanian and foreign artists. The new visions on the development and display of fine arts, as well as the new acquisitions increased the number of artworks at the gallery's disposal and brought about the need for a larger and more functional new building. The Cloud Pavilion outside the National Art Gallery The new venue opened on 29 November 1974. It was situated on the \\"Martyrs of the Nation\\" Boulevard and it is the existing building where the National Gallery of Arts stands today. This new opening is the moment of reorganization and of the first rebuilding programme which consisted in establishing an administrative structure made up of several departments dealing with artistic activities. The fund of the new gallery, up to this time, counted 340 artworks and its archives counted 240 registered artists. From this moment onwards the Gallery of Arts functions as the only and most important national institution of exhibiting, conserving, studying, restoring, publishing, documenting and archiving the works of art in Albania. Inside the gallery In 2009 and 2010, the National Gallery of Arts underwent important renovation works through a series of considerable private and public investments, which consisted in a qualitative reconstruction of interior spaces, aiming to preserve the original architectural project as much as possible. As part of the major reconstruction of the National Gallery, it has also been showing the permanent collection in May 2009, through a new visualizing concept, aiming to a better dissemination, education and information on cultural matters, for an ever increasing Albanian and international public. Today the National Gallery preserves/ conserves over 5,000 artworks. Besides the permanent collection which is focused on Socialist Realism art, famous Albanian artists, international ones and important collections have been part of the different exhibitions in the National Gallery of Arts. An important policy of the NGA activities are also the educational programs, where many children and students participate. Visitors of the National Gallery have the opportunity to enjoy the activities and the exhibitions' rich program, to know more about Albanian visual art.Galeria e Arteve, pavijone të mbyllura dhe mure të pa lyerhttp://artport.al/en/galeria- kombetare-e-arteve-2/  See also  * Culture of Tirana * Landmarks in Tirana * Albanian art  References  External links  * Category:Museums in Tirana Category:Buildings and structures in Tirana Category:Tourist attractions in Tirana Category:Government entities of Albania Category:Art museums and galleries in Albania Category:Albania stubs ","title":"National Museum of Fine Arts (Albania)"},{"id":"25783621","text":"James A.

The novel is more wide-ranging, starting with Spanish explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and ends in the modern day. Although produced for television, Texas was released on home video first. This decision was not due to its quality, but to recoup its $12 million production cost feasibly as broadcast networks had shied away from expensive productions.Nichols, Peter M. \\"'Texas' as a Mini-Series\\".

But the forces that will shape the future of this sprawling land have already been set in motion. It begins with Mexico's infamous and brutal General Santa Anna and explodes into an armed revolt waged by such legendary names as the fiery and headstrong Sam Houston, Stephen Austin, the Father of Texas and the immortal heroes of the Alamo: Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie.

Originally a hamlet in the parish of Worth, it was absorbed by the New Town of Crawley in the 1940s and became part of the Pound Hill neighbourhood. As well as houses, farms and woodland, it became the site of the 1930s aerodrome at Gatwick—now London Gatwick Airport. The airport's first railway station was briefly known as Tinsley Green. The game of marbles has a strong local tradition, and Tinsley Green's pub hosts the British and World Marbles Championship each year. Location Tinsley Green is in the northeast of the Borough of Crawley. The surrounding land is flat and between and above sea level. Gatwick Stream, a tributary of the River Mole, passes under Radford Road at Tinsley Bridge. The road runs east–west from the B2036 road to Crawley's Manor Royal industrial estate. The Brighton Main Line between London and Brighton runs to the west. History The name was first recorded in the 13th century, when Richard de Tyntesle (Richard of Tinsley) was recorded on a tax return. The iron industry thrived in the area from the late 14th century, when the blast furnace was developed; conditions and raw materials around Crawley were ideal for iron production, and many forges were established. One of these was Tinsley Forge. Cast iron was produced at a blast furnace at Tilgate and taken to Tinsley Green, where it was formed into the more useful wrought iron. Although the industry declined in the 17th century, Tinsley Forge was still successful until well into the 18th century, when it finally shut down. Forge Farm was established on the site; the name Black Corner, a bend on the Balcombe–Horley road (the B2036; an old route to London) which runs through Tinsley Green, also refers to the old industry. Radford Farmhouse Some 16th- and 17th-century farmhouses and cottages survive. Radford Farmhouse, a Grade II listed building, is one of only two buildings in Crawley with a thatched roof. The timber-framed cottage may originally have been a barn on the land of its neighbour, Brookside—another Grade II-listed timber-framed house. Oldlands Farmhouse, also 17th-century, was built and owned by the ironmaster who owned Tinsley Forge. Tinsley Green was served by the Anglican church at Lowfield Heath, St Michael and All Angels, from its opening in 1868. It is now within the parish of Crawley Team Ministry, whose main church is St John the Baptist's in the town centre. London Country Bus Services, a bus company which served southeast England between 1970 and deregulation in 1986, built its main engineering workshop in Tinsley Green. Opened in 1976, it was used to carry out painting, repairs and mechanical overhaul of the company's fleet (1,267 vehicles in 1970), and to hold spare parts. At the time of deregulation, a private company, Gatwick Engineering Ltd, was set up to own and operate the works. About 150 people were employed at the site in Tinsley Lane, next to the railway line. National Express now owns the site. Gatwick Aerodrome to Airport Southern train passes the site of the former Tinsley Green station Hunts Green Farm was one of Tinsley Green's old farms. In the 1920s, some of its land was converted into an airfield as flying became more popular and more landing grounds were sought. Earlier in the decade, London's first airport had been established in Croydon. On 1 August 1930, Ronald Walters, a pilot, bought the of land at Hunts Green Farm and converted it into an aerodrome. In 1933 it was sold to A. M. (Morris) Jackaman, who planned to convert it into a relief aerodrome for Croydon Airport and start regular flights to Paris using de Havilland DH.84 Dragon aircraft. From 1935 the Air Ministry were involved; they helped to develop Gatwick Aerodrome's role as a proper airport, and the first terminal building, the Beehive, was built. Later that year, the Southern Railway, Imperial Airways and the owners of Gatwick (now a proper airport rather than an aerodrome) jointly opened a new railway station on the Brighton Main Line, between Gatwick Racecourse and Three Bridges stations, to serve the airport. The station, called Tinsley Green, opened just north of the Radford Road overbridge on 3 September 1935. It was linked by a subway to the terminal, named The Beehive. The name was changed to Gatwick Airport station on 1 June 1936, and it closed on 28 May 1958 after the airport had been rebuilt and extended northwards, making the former Gatwick Racecourse station more convenient. Remains of the platforms could be seen until the 1980s and the subway is still in existence at the Beehive end. Crawley North East Sector Rough pastureland in Tinsley Green, within Crawley North East Sector Crawley New Town's postwar residential areas are known as neighbourhoods. As of , the town has 13. Plans to build a fourteenth neighbourhood on land around Tinsley Green have existed since January 1998. The North East Sector, as it is known, is bounded by Radford Road to the north, the M23 motorway to the east, the A2011 Crawley Avenue to the south and the railway line to the west, and is characterised by rough pastureland, small woods and some brownfield land. Tinsley Green occupies the northern part of this site. As one of the few areas of mostly open land left in the borough, the area around Tinsley Green has been suggested as a development site before: the Commission for New Towns' first masterplan in the late 1940s anticipated that the Manor Royal industrial estate would extend east of the railway line as far as the Balcombe–Horley road, which did not happen; and in the late 1980s, a \\"high-tech industrial park\\" was planned for the site of Forge Farm, which was no longer agricultural and had become the site of an abattoir. The original planning application proposed up to 1,900 residential units, office and retail space, a school, a community centre, playing fields and improvements to road and other infrastructure, including the moving of overhead power lines and pylons. Bus services would be provided to other parts of Crawley, and a new railway station (south of its predecessor) would be considered. Although permission was initially refused, several amendments and appeals were made, and in December 2009 the Government permitted another appeal. A decision would then be made by March 2010. Issues relevant to the scheme include aircraft noise (because of the proximity to Gatwick Airport), the possibility of a second runway being built on the south side of the airport, land contamination and housing density. In February 2011, outline planning permission was granted by Eric Pickles, the Community Secretary, on appeal. Crawley Borough Council adopted the name Forge Wood for the new neighbourhood in December 2013, and construction work started in 2014 along Steers Lane. Marbles The game of marbles has been played in Tinsley Green and the surrounding area for many centuries: TIME magazine traces its origins to 1588. The British and World Marbles Championship has been held at Tinsley Green's pub, The Greyhound, every year since 1932. Traditionally, the marbles- playing season started on Ash Wednesday and lasted until midday on Good Friday: playing after that brought bad luck. More than 20 teams from around the world take part in the championship, each Good Friday; German teams have been successful several times since 2000, although local teams from Crawley, Copthorne and other Sussex and Surrey villages often take part as well; the first championship in 1932 was won by a team from nearby Hookwood. The pub was rebuilt in its present form in 1936, and permanent rings were installed outside for marbles to be played upon.

Standards  American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) created a 'standard' that many states have adopted in ELT design. States that use the AAMVA standard include: Arizona, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia. States that have chosen not to use the AAMVA standard have developed their own proprietary system.  Benefits of ELT for jurisdictions  ELT offers improved data accuracy resulting from the electronic exchange of data (reduction in typographical errors) and improved timeliness of data exchange (no more waiting for the mail and faster lien releases) as well as improved data and forms security. There may be a reduction in the use and control of secure forms (paper costs) and in mailing and printing costs.AAMVA discusses benefits of ELT  Benefits of ELT for lienholder  ELT offers a potential staff reduction in areas associated with filing, retrieval and mailing of certificates and a reduction of storage space needed for filing and storing paper certificates of title. There is increased ease of processing for dealer transactions. It may offer a reduction in title-related fraud.  Drawbacks  A drawback of ELT is that a holder cannot convert ELT to paper same-day in majority of ELT states; some states do offer option expedited printing options. For example, in Ohio, a vehicle owner who wishes to sell a car that has an ELT must first have the lien released by paying the lienholder the remaining amount owed on the lien. The lienholder then releases their lien electronically which allows the customer to pick up the title directly from the OH DMV the following business day. Some states may take up to three months for a paper title to be produced after an electronic lien release, though this is uncommon.  Implementation in the United States  States offering an ELT program include Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. Several states have or will require lenders to participate. * Arizona: May 31, 2010 * California: January 1, 2013 * Florida: January 1, 2013 * Georgia: January 1, 2013 * Louisiana: January 1, 2010 * Nebraska: January 1, 2011 * Nevada: October 1, 2016 * North Carolina: July 1, 2016 * Pennsylvania: July 1, 2008 * South Dakota: July 1, 2012 * Texas: January 1, 2013 * Wisconsin: July 1, 2010 ReferencesExternal links * ELT Trends (online article page 26) Category:Vehicle law Category:Personal finance Category:Credit Category:Liens ","title":"Electronic lien and title"},{"id":"25783681","text":"Events from the year 2010 in Algeria Incumbents * President: Abdelaziz Bouteflika * Prime Minister: Ahmed Ouyahia Events=January *January 5: Terrorists have kidnapped an Algerian engineer who worked for the Canadian firm, SNC-Lavalin.Engineer grabbed in Algeria, The Independent Zambia, January 6, 2009, internet article. *January 11: A Protestant church in Tizi Ouzou was burned by Islamists after being ransacked.
