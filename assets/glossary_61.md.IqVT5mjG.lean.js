The office consists of 21 regional trial offices, a centralized appellate office that handles appeals from every jurisdiction, and a centralized state administrative office. History In 1963, after Gideon v. Wainwright, the Colorado General Assembly passed the Colorado Defender Act. This Act authorized Colorado counties to either establish a public defender's office or remain under the previous ad hoc system of appointing counsel for indigent citizens accused of criminal offenses. Four county public defender offices were established under the Act: Denver, Brighton, Pueblo and Durango. In 1970, the State Legislature passed Senate Bill 126, which created the Office of the State Public Defender as an independent state agency. Initially, the Colorado Supreme Court appointed the Colorado State Public Defender. Rollie R. Rogers was the first State Public Defender. He served from October 1969 through February 1978. On August 1, 1982, David F. Vela was appointed State Public Defender. He fulfilled the responsibilities of the office for more than 17 years, until his retirement on December 31, 1999. David S. Kaplan became the State Public Defender and served from January 1, 2000 until October 31, 2006. Upon his resignation, Douglas K.

Integration crisis Following the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, Clinton High School was ordered in the fall of 1956 to be the first Tennessee high school to desegregate. While twelve black students started attending the school, after extensive riots and physical violence, they decided to boycott school in an effort to force the federal courts to intervene. Rev. Turner, pastor of the white First Baptist Church of Clinton, and a respected leader in the community, felt he needed \\"to lead our church to do the right thing.\\" Spurred by his reading of the Bible and the writings of Olin T. Binkley of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, he began preaching against prejudice. After the black students' boycott, on December 4, 1956, Turner escorted them back to school amid a hostile crowd. Upon his return, he was severely beaten by members of the local White Citizens' Council. Despite significant injuries, the next Sunday, he preached that \\"there is no color line at the cross of Jesus.\\" Subsequent life Turner hoped to attend divinity school but was long unable to obtain the money. In 1958, he moved to another church in Nashville, where he continued to be active in the civil rights movement. He later became a professor at Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary. After being dismissed from his professorate in 1980, Turner committed suicide. His family claimed that \\"his spirit was broken\\" due to his experiences in Clinton.

Etymology The term anubhava or anubhavah (Sanskrit) is a compound of: * ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å anu: 'after', 'afterwards', 'later on', 'in consequence of', 'being indicated by'; * ‡§≠(‡§≠‡•Å)‡§µ bhava: 'causing', 'delighting' or 'experiencing'. Anubhava has a wide range of possible translations: * ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§≠‡§µ ‚Äì 'direct perception or cognition', 'knowledge derived from personal observation or experiment, 'notion', 'apprehension', 'the impression on the mind not derived from memory', 'one of the kinds of knowledge', 'experience', 'understanding', 'result', 'consequence'; * ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§≠‡§µ‡§∏‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß ‚Äì 'established by experience'. Several related words express the mental state which can be communicated to others or represented (‡§Ö‡§≠‡§ø‡§®‡§Ø ‚Äì 'acting'), either verbally or physically or emotionally, in one or different contexts: * ‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ bhƒÅvah: 'feeling', 'emotion', 'sentiment', 'temperament', 'mood'; * ‡§µ‡§ø‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ vibhƒÅvah: 'any condition which produces or develops a particular state of body or mind'; * ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ anubhƒÅvah: 'greatness', 'dignity', 'firm opinion or determination', 'an external manifestation or indication of a feeling by appropriate looks, gestures etc., called by some ensuant'; * ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§≠‡•Ç anubh≈´: to enjoy, taste, experience or suffer; * ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§ø anubh≈´ti: 'realization', self-realization'. AnubhƒÅvas are not causes, but aesthetic experiences and important ingredients of Rasa. Anubhavah is not a sense- experience. Religion =Direct cognition= Anubhavah refers to poetic, narrative or ritual experience, enjoyment, relish or delight resulting, for the devotee or the seeker after truth, in the ecstatic experience of the divine; it is a means to understand during one‚Äôs own life-time the true nature of one‚Äôs own self which is the real nature of the Atman by experiencing the sublime delight of the unity with the Supreme Self. Cognition is said to be of two kinds ‚Äì smrti ('reproductive') which is other than re-cognitive perception requiring disposition, and anubhavah ('productive') which involves a kind of awareness not derived from disposition alone. The difference between the waking state and the dreaming state becomes known through anubhava ('perception'). =Advaita Vedanta= The sage of the Mundaka Upanishad declares: This is so because Brahman is of the nature of experience (anubhuti) and to have the anubhava of Brahman is to become Brahman, thus this revelation, a moment ago non-existing, is realized as existing eternally. Vij√±ƒÅnam is anubhava, and anubhava is realization of the identity of the individual self and Brahman, which experience does not depend on any process, neither produced by any process nor as an effect to any cause and is the highest state of development. With regard to the origination of things, Badarayana declares: Shankara holds anubhava to be a pramana, an independent source of knowledge which is provided by contemplation (nididhyasana). In his commentary on this sutra Shankara explains that a thing cannot be simultaneously judged to be existent and non-existent for the valid knowledge of the true nature of a thing does not depend on human notions and ‡§Ø‡§§‡§É (yatah) ('that from which') in this sutra \\"is not meant to present an inference but speaks of a cause that is by nature eternal, pure, free and intrinsically omniscient\\" (which has to be experienced and felt). The realization of the Supreme Word (≈õabda), which is truth and reality, happens intuitively (a stage of pratibha), and resembles Shankara‚Äôs concept of anubhava. Padmapada (fl. 8th century), a student of Shankara, in his PanchapƒÅdikƒÅ, expounding PrabhƒÅkara‚Äôs view, explains that knowledge is anubhava i.e. the immediate experience, the resultant-cognition gained through valid means of knowledge when the subject and the object manifest and the self of the knower is known indirectly as \\"I\\". And, according to Abhinavagupta, the very continuous and proper remembrance of the mantra (of a ritual) is the attainment of the condition in which the devout upƒÅsaka as a routine has the continuous and direct anubhava ('experience') of the Self as no different from himself. Swami Dayananda notes that anubhava has a more specific meaning than its conventional meaning of \\"experience\\", namely \\"direct knowledge\\". Dayananda explains that interpreting anubahva as \\"experience\\" may lead to a misunderstanding of Advaita Vedanta, and a mistaken rejection of the study of the scriptures as mere intellectual understanding. Stressing the meaning of anubhava as knowledge, Saraswati argues that liberation comes from knowledge, not from mere experience.Advaita Academy, Experience versus knowledge ‚Äì a brief look at samAdhi (Part 2 of 2) Saraswati points out that \\"the experience of the self ... can never come because consciousness is ever-present, in and through each and every experience.\\" =Neo-Vedanta= According to Vivekananda, anubhavah is the ground and source of all religious traditions, the infallible source of liberating knowledge, and the ultimate source of spiritual knowledge; however, he happens to distinguish between internal and external experience, between knowledge gained through words heard and own experience which he finds are not similar in nature and import. According to Reza Shah-Kazemi anubhava is the immediate experience through which the transcendence of the Supreme Self beyond all limitations becomes known as one‚Äôs own self, then one realizes the real nature of one‚Äôs own self. =Saiva Siddhanta= Thayumanavar, the 18th- century Tamil Saiva Siddhanta saint, the one who gains anubhava delights in the unitive experience (advaita anubhava) which is deep and intuitive, and the culmination of all experimental states of Vedanta; it is the svarupa-lakshana. =Waking and dreaming= In the waking state and in the dreaming state, samvedana (‡§∏‡§Ç‡§µ‡•á‡§¶‡§®) ('perception', 'act of perceiving or feeling', 'cognitive awareness') is two-folds ‚Äì i) 'knowledge' and its ii) 'object'; in deep sleep state and turiya state, which states are not different from knowledge, anubhava ('experiencing awareness') is consciousness alone; the enlightened soul does not ever lose this experiencing awareness which event (anubhava) occurs no sooner the object is perceived and its existence is registered. AnubhƒÅvah (‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ‡§É) and Indian aesthetics In poetry, prose and drama, emotions are indirectly communicated to the readers and audience via portrayal of certain aspects of emotion‚Äôs conditions and causes (vibhƒÅva consisting of alambana and uddipana), exterior manifestations or consequences (anubhƒÅva which is vƒÅcika, ƒÅngika or sƒÅttvika) and concomitant accompanying emotions (sancƒÅribhƒÅva) which method is called rasa ('relish') or dhvani and involves diction (riti), rhetoric (alankƒÅra) and oblique expression (vakrokti), and is the finished product of sentiment (sthƒÅyibhƒÅva). BhƒÅva is emotion. Mystic poetry is known as AnubhƒÅvakƒÅvya. Bendre, who started the cultural movement nada-habba, considers mystic experience as an extension of anubhava, and anubhava leads to anubhƒÅva ‚Äì BhƒÅva -> Anubhava -> BhƒÅva -> AnubhƒÅva. In his poem, Sanna Somavara as a poetic composition is seen the transformation of bhƒÅva into anubhava and back to bhƒÅva. There are eight different and distinct rasa or 'sentiments' ‚Äì 'erotic', 'comic', 'pathetic', 'furious', 'heroic', 'terrible', 'odious', and 'marvellous', to which rasa is also added ≈õƒÅnta rasa. Bharata states that rasa is the soul of poetry. The vedic meaning of rasa is 'liquid' or 'flavour'; for Shankara, rasa signifies the intrinsic and spiritual non-material bliss. Natya Shastra (St.109) explains that rasa is produced from a combination of determinants (vibhƒÅva), consequents or histrionic representations (anubhƒÅva) and any of the thirty-three transitory states (vyabhicƒÅribhƒÅva), according to which text, 'love', 'mirth', 'sorrow', 'anger', 'energy', 'terror', 'disgust' and 'astonishment' are the eight dominant states or sthƒÅyibhƒÅva; 'paralysis', 'perspiration', 'horripilation', 'change of voice', 'trembling', 'change of colour', 'weeping' and 'fainting' are the eight temperamental states or sattvikabhƒÅva, and emphasizes on histrionic representation or abhinaya of the anubhƒÅva presented by the characters developed by the playwright. Abhinavagupta states that ≈õƒÅnta rasa, also a sthƒÅyibhƒÅva, leads to moksha, for it is the very experience of pure consciousness; vibhƒÅva also means 'pure consciousness' and anubhƒÅva also means the experience arising from pure consciousness. Rasa is an experience of pure consciousness brought about by the aesthetic contents, impressions and stimuli for the mind, the intellect and the emotions; vibhƒÅva causes a specific emotional state to cause an anubhƒÅva (effect) which is defined as means of histrionic representation. The experience of rasa is the experience of the different levels of perception corresponding to the different transitory mental states, the sƒÅttvika-bhƒÅvas, for example, are involuntary and uncontrollable physical responses produced from certain mental states. Bhatta Lolatta states that rasa is intensified sthƒÅyibhƒÅva located in the character (anukƒÅrya) and the actor (anukartƒÅ) by virtue of the power of identification.

The formal diplomatic relations of Japan and Sweden was established by the signing of Swedish-Japanese Treaty in 1868, which was also the first treaty Meiji Government made with a foreign state.

Education He entered National Taiwan University in 1984, originally for international business, but after a year he switched to mathematics. He earned his BS in Mathematics at National Taiwan University in 1988 and his MS from the same institution in 1992. He received a PhD in Mathematics in 1998 from Harvard University with a thesis entitled \\"Generalized harmonic maps and representations of discrete groups.\\" His thesis adviser at Harvard was Chinese Fields Medalist and differential geometer Shing-Tung Yau. Career Wang joined the Columbia faculty as an assistant professor in 2001, and was appointed full professor in 2009. Before joining the faculty at Columbia, Wang was Szego Assistant Professor at Stanford University. He was a Sloan Research Fellow from 2003‚Äì2005. In 2007, he was named a Kavli Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences and was awarded the Chern Prize. Wang is a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society and won the Morningside Gold Medal of Mathematics in 2010. In 2010, Wang delivered the plenary address at the International Congress of Chinese Mathematicians, and was plenary speaker at the International Congress on Mathematical Physics. In addition, he was also plenary speaker at the International Conference on Differential Geometry in 2011. After winning the Morningside Medal, Wang told interviewers that he did not consider himself a particularly good student and did not consistently make good grades. He struggled with studying topics which did not interest him just for the grade, but spends a lot of time on subjects which interested him. He credits his career in mathematics to two people: his mother and his thesis adviser Shing-Tung Yau. He cites his mother's support and understanding of his decision to switch to mathematics in university despite it being a much less lucrative field, and describes meeting Yau in 1992 as the pivotal point in his life when he decided to make mathematics research his primary focus. Work Wang's research is focused in the fields of differential geometry and mathematical physics, specifically general relativity. He has studied higher co-dimensional mean curvature flow extensively, leading to criteria relating to the flow's existence, regularity, and convergence. In the field of general relativity, he is especially known for his work on quasilocal mass-energy; the Wang-Yau quasi-local mass is named in his honor.

This type of blocking will only work if the attacking piece is a type that can move linearly an indefinite number of squares such as a queen, rook, or bishop and there is at least one empty square in the line between the attacking and attacked piece. Blocking is not an option when the attacking piece is directly adjacent to the piece it is attacking, or when the attacking piece is a knight (because knights \\"jump over other pieces\\" and cannot be blocked). When an opponent's attack on a piece is blocked, the blocking piece is to some extent pinned, either relatively or absolutely, until a future move by either side allows it to be unpinned. A check on a king by an opponent's queen, rook, or bishop can sometimes be blocked by moving a piece to a square in line in between the opponent's checking piece and the checked king. The blocking piece is then absolutely pinned to the king by the attacking piece. Another type of interposing in chess can involve placing a piece between two opponent's pieces where one of those pieces is protecting the other, or they are both protecting each other. This chess tactic can be called interference.  Blocking and initiative  When the attack cannot be ignored, the attacking player has the initiative. The defending player may be able to acquire the initiative by blocking and attacking at the same time, by attacking an undefended attacker with the blocking piece, with a discovered attack, or when the block is also a check or a cross-check.

It now has 24 offices worldwide, including Abu Dhabi, Copenhagen, Dakar, Dar es Salaam, Geneva, Johannesburg, Lagos, London, Mumbai, Nairobi, New Delhi, New York City, San Francisco, Singapore, Washington D.C. Its clients include corporations, foundations and NGOs operating in emerging and developing markets and national governments. https://dalberg.com/who-we- are/our-global-locations Projects include studies for the United Nations, World Bank and the President of Liberia. In 2007, the firm collaborated with the Financial Times and the United Nations Global Compact to provide an assessment of the quality of NGOs and the United Nations' agencies that have established working relationships with private-sector companies. Projects Dalberg has advised investment funds for organizations and governments in Asia and Africa, including investments in wind energy projects in the People's Republic of China and geothermal energy plants in Indonesia. Dalberg recommended energy-sector reforms to the Government of Montenegro, and advised a U.S. think-tank on the energy markets in Pakistan and the Middle East. In Tanzania, the firm provided advice on strategies to meet Millennium Development Goals energy targets by 2012. A new drug, known as the Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), was available to combat malaria, but was largely inaccessible to the masses because of cost and distribution challenges. The World Bank commissioned Dalberg to design a mechanism to reduce the cost of ACTs. In November 2007, the design for the Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria (AMFm) was approved by the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Partnership Board. Other projects in this sector have included designing initiatives to support people with chronic diseases in developing countries and advising pharmaceutical companies in Venezuela on profitable growth.

It was first published in 1969, and later as part of the collection, Neanderthal Planet, in 1970. Plot summary In a futuristic Manhattan, AIs have become intelligent and independent of humans. Able to think and communicate with both great precision and speed, they find humans and their problems primitive, backward, and largely uninteresting. The 19,940 existing humans are kept on a reserve, out of the AIs' way, and are largely ignored except for when they wander into the surrounding domain of the machines. One human, Anderson, is an author. He escapes the zoo in an act of defiance, despite knowing that the effort is futile and that the AIs cannot understand the significance of his act. He is captured by the Chief Scanner robot, who affects the name \\"Euler\\". Before Euler can return the tranquilised Anderson to the other humans, his superior, Dominant, insists that they interview Anderson. The AIs wish to understand his behaviour, and use Anderson's last published story, \\"A Touch of Neanderthal\\", as a point of discussion. Thus begins a story within a story. Anderson tells of Nehru II, a planet with a harsh environment, settled by humans, which has fallen out of contact with Earth and does not respond to any messages. The main character, also named Anderson, is sent to discover the problem, because he had personally known one of the settlers. On the planet, he glimpses a baby woolly rhinoceros, despite its species being long extinct. He subsequently meets a number of sub-human savages, startling but largely harmless, and two relatively normal humans, Stanley A. Menderstone and Alice. They are living as recluses in a wooden building in the remains of the only settled village. Menderstone and Alice are, at first, reluctant to divulge why the settlers seem to have regressed into such a primitive state. Staying the night, Anderson sneaks out and finds his old friend, now playing the role of tribal chieftain among the savages. In horror, Anderson flees back to the house, where he hallucinates that a steel metal rod transforms into a snake and attacks him. Eventually, Alice reveals what has occurred on the planet. Mankind, she says, is a hybrid race, a mixture of the original Cro-Magnons and Neanderthals. Some people have more of one element in them than the other. Earth had purposefully not allowed sophisticated equipment be sent with the original settlers of Nehru II in an attempt to make them dependent so they could not possibly rebel in the future, but as a result the settlers found themselves in conditions not unlike prehistoric Earth, having to contend with the environment, shape simple tools, and make fire from basic materials. As a result, those with a stronger Neanderthal element within themselves began to become dependent on it to survive, and regressed into a more Neanderthal state of being. Alice and Menderstone happen to have less Neanderthal in them, so they remained as they are. Shocked, Anderson escapes the house, in a desperate attempt to get to his ship and leave the planet. On the way, he hallucinates other animals and events, supposed to be a racial memory of prehistoric times, and finds himself unable to handle artificial objects, repulsed by their alienness. Alice again finds him, and explains that now that the Neanderthal part of his mind has taken hold there is nothing that can stop it. Although at first frightened and resistant, Anderson finds himself seeing his environment, once harsh and untamed, as beautiful and idyllic. Despite his early statements to the contrary, he eventually abandons his clothes and weapons and runs to join the blissful Neanderthals in the forest. Euler and Dominant demand to know the meaning of this story, which Anderson is unable to give, insisting that it was nothing more than a bit of fancy. When pressed, Anderson relents that it might represent the inability of a society to truly move onto a higher, more advanced mode of life when the presence of the primitive still holds it back. Over the next week, the AIs disappear entirely. Back at the human zoo, Anderson and his wife Sheila discuss the event. Although Sheila congratulates him on tricking the AIs to leave, Anderson says that he truly feels that humans were holding them back. They communicated in English, had anthropomorphic designs, took personal names, and a host of other inefficient idiosyncrasies due to their history with humans. By abandoning their trappings of humanity, the AIs have finally had the push they needed to become abstract entities, something incomprehensible to the humans as it has nothing at all in common with them.

Her mainly fictional works present the horrors of Fascism, especially the repression of minorities. Early life and education Kerschbaumer was born in Garches near Paris where her Cuban father and Austrian mother were living to escape the Spanish Civil War. After spending her childhood years mainly in Costa Rica and the Austrian Tyrol, she worked in England for a year when she was 17 and then went on to Italy. In 1957, she returned to Austria to further her education. From 1963, she studied Romance languages at Vienna University and spent two years in Romania before earning a doctorate in Romanian linguistics in 1973. In 1971, she married the painter Helmut Kurz-Goldenstein. Career After completing her studies, Kerschbaumer worked as a translator, mainly from Spanish. Her first novel, Der Schwimmer (The Swimmer) was published in 1976, describing how inmates tried to escape from an institution in Franco's Spain. In 1980, she gained fame by publishing Der weibliche Name des Widerstands (The Feminine Name of Resistance) consisting of seven fictional accounts of women in Nazi concentration camps.

Her third work, Schwestern (Sisters, 1982) is a novel tracing the experiences of several generations of an Austrian family as the events of the 20th century affect their lives. Kerschbaumer has also written plays which have been well received on Austrian radio but have not been published.

Later that day she came to the assistance of the cruise ship , which was transiting the Gulf of Oman en route from Sharm-al-Sheikh in Egypt to Dubai. Mecklenburg- Vorpommern detected pirate speedboats apparently attempting to attack Astor, and manoeuvred into their path while they were three miles from the Astor. Warning bursts of machine gun fire were used to ward off the threat without those on the cruise ship becoming aware of the situation. On 11 February 2014 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern deployed from Wilhelmshaven with the frigates Hamburg and Augsburg, the corvette Oldenburg and the storeship Frankfurt am Main to take part in the navy's annual training and exercises. These concluded at Kiel on 20 June 2014, during which time the ships carried out manoeuvrers as far north as the Arctic Circle and as far south as the Equator, visiting 13 ports in nine countries. In December 2015 the ship was awarded the flag band of the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern by the Minister-President of Mecklenburg- Vorpommern Erwin Sellering in Warnem√ºnde. While transiting the Kiel Canal near Sch√ºlp bei Rendsburg on 9 December 2015 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern was involved in a collision with the Cypriot-flagged container ship Nordic Bremen. The frigate's bow was badly damaged. On 16 August 2016 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern left Wilhelmshaven to participate in the EU Navfor Med mission in the Mediterranean from mid-September. She returned to Wilhelmshaven on 23 December, having briefly been part of the NATO's Operation Sea Guardian. She deployed again with EU Navfor Med on 7 August 2017. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern arrived at the Sicilian port of Augusta on 16 August 2017, taking over from the replenishment ship Rhein. Leadership of the force transferred at this time from Captain Marco Reinisch, to Mecklenburg-Vorpommerns commander Christian Schultze. Over the next few months Mecklenburg-Vorpommern gave assistance several times to migrant boats in distress, as part of Operation Sophia. On 13 September 2017 she rescued 134 people, on 25 October 158 people and on 2 November 323 people. A woman from Nigeria gave birth to a boy on 3 November 2017, with the support of the ship's medical team. On 1 November 2017, a patrol boat of the Libyan Coast Guard carried out aggressive manoeuvres near the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The head of the Libyan Coast Guard, Commodore Abdalh Toumia, later apologized. After five months on station Mecklenburg-Vorpommern was relieved by the frigate Sachsen in mid-January 2018. She arrived back in Wilhelmshaven on 26 January 2018, having sailed 29,000 nautical miles and rescued 700 people.

Her predecessor was the cruiser of the Imperial German Navy, one of the Bremen class. Construction and commissioning Bremen was laid down in July 1979 at the yards of Bremer Vulkan, Bremen and launched on 27 September 1979. Her sponsor was Christine Koschnick, wife of the then mayor of Bremen Hans Koschnick. After undergoing trials Bremen was commissioned on 7 May 1982. During her later career she was based at Wilhelmshaven as part of 4. Fregattengeschwader, forming a component of Einsatzflottille 2. Initially built with five-bladed Sulzer-Escher propellers, these were later replaced with seven-bladed ones from Wegemann & Company, making Bremen the fastest of her class. She was also the first warship in the navy to carry a helicopter. Service Bremen participated in various international missions during her career. She was frequently deployed to participate in NATO permanent monitoring missions in the Mediterranean during the Gulf War in 1991. In late January 1992 she escorted the German freighter Godewind into Cartagena, Spain. The Godewind had been intercepted in the Mediterranean by the destroyer M√∂lders while transporting T-72 tanks from Poland to Syria without German permission. From 1992 to 1996 Bremen was active in the Adriatic Sea as part of NATO's Operation Sharp Guard, the maritime blockade of the former Yugoslavia during the Yugoslav Wars. From 2002 she served in the counter-terrorism Operation Enduring Freedom. In 2009 Bremen joined Operation Atalanta, the EU's anti-piracy mission off the Horn of Africa. On 14 August 2009 she deployed her helicopter to counter a pirate attack on the Turkish-flagged merchant ship MS Elgiznur Cebi. On encountering a pirate skiff and six pirates, the helicopter fired warning shots to force it to stop. The skiff was then seized by the Greek frigate Narvarinon, which found weapons and boarding ladders. In May 2012 Bremen was again deployed with Operation Atalanta, taking over from the replenishment oiler Berlin, in a ceremony attended by German Secretary of State . Bremen was relieved from these duties in September 2012 by the Sachsen-class frigate Sachsen. Decommissioning Bremen was removed from active service on 30 September 2013, and was decommissioned on 28 March 2014 at Wilhelmshaven by her final commander, Ingolf Schlobinsky. By this time she had been in service for 32 years, and had sailed over 1.5 million kilometres, under the command of 16 different captains. She was laid up in Wilhelmshaven as a source of spare parts for the remaining Bremen-class frigates in service.

Fregattengeschwader, forming a component of Einsatzflottille 2. Her sponsor was Adele Albrecht, wife of the then Prime Minister of Lower Saxony Ernst Albrecht. Service Niedersachsen participated in various international missions during her career. In October 1989 she and the destroyer Rommel and the supply ship Coburg visited Leningrad, the first German navy ships to visit a Soviet/Russian port for 77 years. Niedersachsen was frequently deployed to participate in NATO permanent monitoring missions in the Mediterranean and Atlantic, including Standing Naval Force Atlantic (SNFL) and Standing Naval Force Mediterranean (SNFM) in 1992. In 1995 Niedersachsen took part in the British-organised Joint Maritime Course, and was again part of Standing Naval Force Mediterranean in 1997. In March 1997 she was ordered into Albanian waters as part of Operation Libelle, the German-led evacuation of foreign nationals as the Albanian Civil War broke out. Niedersachsen operated off Durres during the evacuation, using her radar to monitor Albanian airspace. Niedersachsen was again part of Standing Naval Force Atlantic in 2000 and 2004. She deployed in 2004 to participate in the NATO exercise Medshark/Majestic Eagle, and in 2007 was attached to the maritime component of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. From 8 January to 12 June 2008 Niedersachsen deployed with Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 in the Mediterranean Sea, conducting exercises and training sessions with Italian, Turkish, US, UK and Greek ships to promote international cooperation. In February she was also part of Operation Active Endeavour, the NATO anti- terrorist and anti-smuggling mission, off the Egyptian coast and in waters off Lebanon, Albania and southern Sardinia. During this time Niedersachsen visited 17 different ports in the Mediterranean, including Aksaz Naval Base and Antalya (Turkey), Haifa (Israel), Volos (Greece), Trieste, Palermo, Naples and Savona (Italy). In 2011 Niedersachsen joined Operation Atalanta, the EU's anti-piracy mission off the Horn of Africa. On 20 April 2011 she carried out repairs to a disabled Yemeni dhow. On 10 June she detected a suspected Pirate Action Group (PAG), consisting of a fishing dhow and two attack skiffs, believed to have carried out a number of attacks on merchant vessels in the area. The Niedersachsen sank the two skiffs, after which the dhow returned to Somalia. Niedersachsen returned to Operation Atalanta in 2013. While patrolling off the Somali coast on 5 November 2013 she located a whaler towing a skiff, crewed by 10 men and carrying over 10 fuel barrels and 2 long ladders. When the Niedersachsen approached the suspect vessels, the men aboard the whaler threw the ladders overboard and returned to the shore.

Service =Early deployments= Rheinland-Pfalz was involved in several foreign missions since her commissioning. From 1992 to 1996 she was deployed several times in the Adriatic Sea as part of Operation Sharp Guard, blockading the former Yugoslavia. In 1999 she supported Operation Allied Force, the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. In 2001 she was part of a Destroyer Exercise (DESEX), followed by a deployment in 2004 with Operation Enduring Freedom ‚Äì Horn of Africa, and in the Gulf of Aden. Rheinland-Pfalz took part in Operation Active Endeavour in the Mediterranean in 2005, and in 2006 joined the South African naval exercises Good Hope II. In early 2009 she was briefly once more part of Operation Active Endeavour, before departing for the waters off the Horn of Africa to participate in Operation Atalanta, combatting piracy off the coast of Somalia. She relieved her sister ship Karlsruhe on patrol on 22 January 2009. =Operation Atalanta 2009= On 3 March at 7:12 local time, the 14,969 ton Antigua and Barbuda-registered container ship MV Courier, owned by a Bremen-based shipping company and manned by a Filipino crew, sent a distress message reporting the attack of pirates on board a small vessel. The assailants fired rocket propelled grenades and automatic rifles at the freighter. The emergency call was received by the Rheinland-Pfalz, which was located 50 nautical miles away. The German warship dispatched her Westland Lynx helicopter to the scene, which fired warning shots at the hostile launch. The Sea Lynx was joined by a Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk from the US guided-missile cruiser USS Monterey. A couple of hours later, the pirate skiff was intercepted by the German frigate and seized by German marines, who captured nine suspects. The German boarding party found a cache of one rocket launcher, three AK-47 rifles, a Tokarev pistol, a carbine and an automatic rifle. This was the first time that the German Navy seized a hostile vessel and her crew at sea since the Second World War. Early in the morning of 30 March 2009, a group of Somali pirates approached the German naval replenishment tanker Spessart, opened fire upon her and attempted to board the vessel. The attack was averted by the on-board security detachment, who opened fire on the pirates. A chase then ensued, ending with the pirates being stopped and detained by the Rheinland-Pfalz. On 3 August 2009 the captured merchant vessel was released from pirate control, with Rheinland-Pfalz and the frigate Brandenburg escorting her into port in Mombasa, Kenya. =Later service= Rheinland-Pfalz took part in exercises and manoeuvrers in 2011, and in February that year sailed to the Libyan coast to assist in the evacuation of German citizens caught up in the Libyan Civil War. On 5 March 2011 Rheinland- Pfalz entered the Tunisian port of Gab√®s, along with the Brandenburg and the replenishment ship Berlin, embarking several hundred Egyptian refugees and transporting them to Alexandria. On 1 February 2012 Rheinland-Pfalz left her homeport to join Standing NATO Maritime Group 1 in the Mediterranean. This would be her last international deployment. On 11 September 2012 Rheinland- Pfalz was removed from active duty, and was officially decommissioned on 22 March 2013, the second ship of the Bremen class to leave service. In April 2017 Rheinland-Pfalz was auctioned off via the state-owned Vebeg GmbH for scrapping. In December 2017, the ship arrived at Aliaƒüa for scrapping.

Her predecessor was the frigate Emden of the Bundesmarine, one of the K√∂ln class. Construction and commissioning Emden was laid down in June 1980 at the yards of Nordseewerke, Emden and launched on 17 December 1980. Her sponsor was Elfriede Klinkenborg, the wife of the Lord Mayor of Emden. After undergoing trials Emden was commissioned on 7 October 1983 . During her later career she was based at Wilhelmshaven as part of 4. Fregattengeschwader, forming a component of Einsatzflottille 2. The Emden continued the tradition of her predecessors in the German navies, in carrying a large Iron Cross decoration, in honour of the achievements of the first during the First World War. The Iron Cross was displayed at the front of the bridge until her removal from active service. It was then presented to Australia by Inspector of the Navy Vizeadmiral Axel Schimpf on 6 October 2013, at the Royal Australian Navy's International Fleet Review marking the centenary of the Royal Australian Navy's establishment at Sydney. Service In 1984 Emdens crew won the \\"Barbarian Prize\\" for the best gunnery of the fleet. Later that year she carried out combat training in the UK, at the Isle of Portland. From January to March 1994 Emden was the flagship of Kapit√§n zur See , the commander of 4. Fregattengeschwader, during Destroyer Exercise (DESEX) 1/94 in the South Atlantic. The Emden, the tanker Rh√∂n, the supply ship and the frigate Bremen sailed to Dakar, accompanied at times by ships of the Royal Navy and the French Navy. The German ships continued on to call at Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Mar del Plata and Recife. At Roosevelt Roads Naval Station they were joined by the frigate Niedersachsen for gunnery practice. In 1995 and 1996 she was the flagship of Flottillenadmiral . In June 1996 Emden was active in the Adriatic Sea as part of NATO's Operation Sharp Guard, the maritime blockade of the former Yugoslavia during the Yugoslav Wars. In early October 1998 she collided with the Kaiser Wilhelm Bridge. She went on to serve in several other international missions, including Operation Enduring Freedom in three separate deployments in 2002, 2006 and 2008, and as part of Standing NATO Maritime Group 1 in Operation Active Endeavour from 18 October to 6 November 2006. During Emdens 2008 deployment in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, which lasted from 12 February to 8 July, the frigate was active off the Horn of Africa. On 21 April she launched her helicopter in response to a Somalian pirate attack on the Japanese oil tanker Takayama. The helicopter successfully dispersed the pirates. During the night of 23 to 24 April Emden escorted the sailing ship Star Clipper, after she was approached by several suspicious speedboats. On 28 June she assisted the merchant vessel Amiya Scan, which had just been released from pirate control. The Emden provided emergency water, food, fuel and first aid equipment, and the services of a medical team. It was planned that in early 2009 Emden would sail to Australia as part of Standing NATO Maritime Group 1. During the course of the voyage she would have passed close to the location where the earlier , a cruiser of the Imperial German Navy, had been sunk in 1914. The voyage was cancelled when Emden was instead assigned to transit the Suez Canal to take part in Operation Atalanta, the EU's anti-piracy mission off the Horn of Africa. Emden carried out a second deployment with Operation Atalanta, beginning in January 2010, until her relief on 19 May 2010 by the frigate Schleswig-Holstein. On 19 February she was sent to investigate a dhow and a skiff acting strangely. The dhow was discovered abandoned and was taken in tow to prevent it being a hazard to shipping. The dhow was later returned to its Yemeni owner by the Italian ship Etna. On 11 March she was routed to an area where a number of attacks had been reported. She came across a mothership and two skiffs, and a boarding party was dispatched. One skiff was sunk and the other seized as evidence. On 18 March she responded to reports of an attack on the Spanish fishing vessel Albatun 2. En route she discovered two pirate skiffs and a mothership, destroying the skiffs and seizing grappling ladders. Two days later another mothership and two skiffs were discovered. A team boarded the mothership and destroyed weapons, grappling hooks and ladders and the two skiffs. In 2013 Emden participated in the navy's annual training voyage ('), before returning to Wilhelmshaven, where she was removed from active service on 15 June 2013, and formally decommissioned by Fregattenkapit√§n Hendrik H√ºlsmann on 29 November 2013.

Situated upon a low chalk escarpment overlooking the Thames marshes, Cliffe offers views of Southend-on-Sea and London. It forms part of the parish of Cliffe and Cliffe Woods in the borough of Medway. The population of the village is included in the civil parish of Cliffe and Cliffe Woods. In 774 Offa, King of Mercia, built a rustic wooden church dedicated to St Helen, a popular Mercian saint who was by legend the daughter of Coel (\\"Old King Cole\\") of Colchester. Cliffe is cited in early records as having been called Clive and Cliffe-at- Hoo. Ancient Saxon town Clovesho, or Clofeshoch, was an ancient Saxon town, in Mercia and near London,Bede, ed. Plummer, II, 214. where the Anglo- Saxon Church is recorded as holding the important Councils of Clovesho between 742 and 825. These had representation from the archbishopric of Canterbury and the whole English church south of the Humber. The location of Cloveshoo has never been successfully identified, but in the 18th century Cliffe was thought to be one possible location. 1200‚Äî1900 St Helen's Church in May 2015The Grade I listed St Helen's Church at Cliffe was built about 1260 and was constructed in the local style of alternating layers of Kent ragstone and squared black flint. It is one of the largest parish churches in Kent, and the only one dedicated to St Helen, the size of the church revealing its past importance. It contains wall paintings of the martyrdom of St. Edmund, a Jacobean pulpit, and fine stone carvings.Christopher Winn: I Never Knew That about the River Thames (London: Ebury Press, 2010), p. 236. Above the porch is a muniments room containing important historical documents. During the 14th century Cliffe was the site of a farm owned by the monks of Christ's Church, Canterbury, when the village had a population of about 3,000. In the late Middle Ages the village of Cliffe supported a port, which thrived until a disastrous fire in 1520 stifled its growth, marking a period of decline, accentuated by the silting of the marshes of the Thames Estuary. Cliffe-at-Hoo was still considered a town in the 16th century, but by the middle of the 19th century the population had slumped to about 900. In 1824, construction of the Thames and Medway Canal was begun, providing work for able-bodied villagers and other labourers who came to the area, increasing the population again. However, the canal project was a short-lived enterprise, superseded by the development of the railways, although the canal route, including the Higham and Strood tunnel (2.25 miles in length, in two sections) was used by South Eastern Railway from 1845, bringing a branch line to Cliffe in 1882. Henry Pye Even in 1895 the number of people contracting malaria was high but casualties began to decrease sharply after the farmer, Henry Pye, came to the area and systematically began the drainage of the farmland and marshes, thus eliminating the carrier of the fever. He drained such a large area of the marsh and so improved the grazing pastures that he was called 'King of the Hundreds'. Henry Pye was an innovator in farming practices promoting the use of Aveling and Porter steam engines, locally built in Rochester, for use in ploughing and threshing. In 1878, with other farmers Pye met with the South Eastern Railway Company and petitioned for a railway to be built, resulting in the establishment of the 'Hundred of Hoo Railway Company'. The first part of the line was opened in March 1882, running from Cliffe to Sharnal Street. Victorian Cliffe Arriva Medway Towns Plaxton Pointer 2 bodied Dennis Dart SLF outside the Six Bells pub in April 2014 The rise of the Kent cement industry brought a new prosperity to the ancient settlement during the Victorian era. Alfred Francis (second son of Charles), with his son, established the firm of Francis and Co. at the Nine Elms office at Vauxhall, London, and then built the cement works at Cliffe in about 1860. Francis and Co instituted the Nine Elms cement works . These works were built on Cliffe marsh, to the west of the village where the chalk cliffs came almost to within a mile of the River Thames. The area also proved a useful source of clay. Alfred Francis died in 1871, but in partnership his son continued to produce \\"Portland, Roman, Medina and Parian cement, Portland stucco and Plaster of Paris\\", also shipping chalk, flints and fire bricks, from the site. The riverside location provided ease of transport and wharves were duly built at the mouth of Cliffe creek. A canal was constructed from the works, which gave its name to a tavern built nearby, now long demolished but remembered as the Canal Tavern. 1870‚Äì71 saw further developments to the cement works, which were rebuilt and extended, with an elaborate tramway added. Methods of extracting the chalk were basic, involving the labourer being suspended by a rope (around his waist) secured at the cliff top, from which position he would hack out the chalk, so that it fell to the ground below to be collected in a waiting railway wagon. Further to the north of the Francis and Company works near the river, an explosive works (Curtis and Harvey) opened in 1901. Over the factory's 20-year history, 16 people were to lose their lives in explosions. Francis and Company was taken over about 1900 by the British Portland Cement Company, but after the Great War the cement works began to decline, and was finally phased out in 1920‚Äì21. By 1901 the population of Cliffe exceeded 3,000. Alpha Cement The Alpha Cement works began near the Francis works in 1910 as part of the Thames Portland Cement Company. It stood about a mile from the river and included a Goshead aerial cableway, which ran alongside the road constructed by the soldiers of Cliffe Fort, then disused. Alpha continued after the closure of the Francis works, which it took over in 1934. With this amalgamation an additional railway was added in 1935 to replace the cableway, linking the works with the quayside next to the fort. The Alpha site, however, became exhausted by 1950, and further digging led to extensive flooding, as quarrying exceeded the depth of the water table. These quarries, still flooded, offer havens for wildlife, and are among the few surviving that have not been used for rubbish infill or otherwise developed. A second quarry was begun to the north of Salt Lane, which is still the main access road to Cliffe from the cement works area, on the very edge of the marshes. By the late 1950s the cement industry in the area was owned by the APCM, which had added a further railway line to the Hundred of Hoo railway, giving the cement manufacturers direct access to the main railway network. The works at Cliffe shut on 1 April 1970, with no further space available for quarrying, but the APCM recreation ground in the centre of the village has remained a valuable open space, with pitches for football, cricket, tennis and bowls. In 1970 the cement industry was replaced by the Marinex gravel company, whose fleet of ships dredged gravel from the Thames Estuary. The chalk quarry to the south side of Salt Lane is now a wildfowl reserve. In addition, it offers fishing and diving. The water is around fifty to sixty feet deep in parts and divers explore the bed of the old quarry and other underwater features www.bucklandlake.com  Burmah Total oil refinery  Between 1971 and 1981 the Burmah-Total oil company planned to build an oil refinery on Cliffe marshes. However, the oil crises of 1973-4 and 1979-81 made the project uneconomic. On 23 August 1971 Burmah Total Refineries Trust Limited (a joint venture between Total Oil Refineries (G.B.) Limited and Burmah Oil Refineries Limited) applied for planning permission for the construction of an oil refinery, jetty, pipelines and a distribution terminal at Cliffe in Kent.Draft letter Dept of the Environment to Messrs Denton, Hall and Burgin dated 9 November 1973, The National Archives, HLG 156/609 The facilities were to comprise: * an oil refinery and deep-water jetty on 360 acres (146 ha) of land at Cliffe marshes (51.4383¬∞N 0.4833¬∞E),Hansard, House of Commons Debate, 2 April 1974.Strood Rural District Council: application by Burmah Total for oil refinery at Cliffe marshes, The National Archives, HLG 156/609. this was an 'L' shaped site 2.0 km east-to-west and 0.9 km north-to-south at its widest point, * the construction of a road and rail loading terminal facility at Hoo Junction on the North Kent railway line (51.4417¬∞N 0.4500¬∞E), * pipelines between the sites of the refinery and the terminal. The estimated construction cost was ¬£60 million. The application was considered by Strood Rural District Council and on 2 November 1971 by Kent County Council. Planning consent was approved subject to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Peter Walker, indicating the project was in the national interest. Walker ‚Äòcalled in‚Äò the application and a public inquiry, chaired by H.M.A. Stedham, was held at Cliffe Village Hall for four weeks from 11 April 1972.Letter Burmah Total Refineries Trust Limited to Department of Environment, dated 15 January 1974, The National Archives, HLG 156/609 The inspector found ‚Äòno serious objections to the refinery on ground of pollution, noise, navigational safety or agriculture‚Äô. There were however concerns about it impact on an un-spoilt coastal area and the inadequacy of local roads. The inspector was not satisfied that the national interest justified the approval and recommended refusal. However, the Secretary of State, by then Geoffrey Rippon, considered that ‚Äòit is in the national interest for additional refinery capacity to be made available to meet expected requirements in south-east England‚Äô. One condition was there should only be a single chimney designed to discharge flue gases at a minimum height of 120 metres. Departmental draft files indicate that the Secretary of State granted outline planning permission in November 1973. On 15 January 1974 Burmah Total Refineries Trust Limited wrote to the Department of the Environment complaining that the project had then been delayed two and a half years and had entailed considerable expense in renewal of land options and escalation of project costs. They believed that ‚Äòan immediate decision is now fairly due to us‚Äô. Nevertheless, as a result of the 1973 oil crisis no further development was undertaken. The project was revived in 1981 when an inspector from the Department of the Environment granted planning permission for the refinery.'Refinery to go ahead', The Times, 20 May 1981, p.17. This was despite local objections at a public inquiry.J.R. Parker 'Oil refinery objections' The Times, 9 June 1981, p.18 However, the project was not developed any further by Burmah Total, likely to have been a consequence of the Iranian revolution and the associated oil price increases. Cliffe Rectory Old Cliffe Rectory is some two miles (3.2 km) inland from St Helen's Church, supposedly to preserve its inhabitants from the malaria on the marshes. It has housed two chancellors of the exchequer, two archbishops, three deans and 11 archdeacons. Nicholas Heath, Bishop of Rochester and Bishop of Worcester also lived at the rectory. The \\"living\\" at Cliffe in the 17th century was described as \\"one of the prizes of the church\\". Susanna, the daughter of Samuel Annesley, who married the Reverend Samuel Wesley, father of John Wesley, founder of the Wesleyans, also lived at Cliffe Rectory. The rector of the rich living of Cliffe from April 1815 was Charles Burney the younger (1757‚Äì1817), son of the music historian Charles Burney, and brother of the novelist Frances Burney and the naval explorer James Burney.The Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney..., ed. Peter Hughes et al., Vol. VIII (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980), p. 115 n. The new rectory is within sight of the church. Cliffe Churchyard Charnel House in May 2015.In the corner of the church graveyard is a Grade II listed Charnel House that was used to store bodies dragged out of the River Thames estuary, thought to have been erected in the mid-19th century. Rye Farm The Grade II listed barn at Rye Farm, in Common Lane, Cliffe dates from the 1570s. It is described as a 16th century Grade II barn \\"with archaic details\\". Beneath its present asbestos roof is a timber framed three bay barn with weatherboarded walls and a traditional hipped roof. It includes an ancient waggon porch. Cliffe Fort Cliffe Fort in 2007 Brennan torpedo tracks at Cliffe Fort Cliffe Fort is a Royal Commission fort built in the 1860s on the edge of the marshes to protect against invasion via the Thames. A Brennan Torpedo station was added in 1890, the rails of which are still visible at low water, and was used as an anti- aircraft battery in the Second World War. It is now inside a gravel extraction site and is inaccessible and very overgrown, but can be viewed from the riverside path. Cliffe Airport In 2002 the government identified a site at Cliffe as the leading contender among potential sites for a new airport for London. In December 2003 the government decided against the Cliffe proposal on the grounds that the costs of a coastal site were too high, and there was a significant risk that the airport would not be well used. Hans Egede The Hans Egede in 2007 A prominent feature where the marshes meet the river for many years, the Hans Egede was a wooden, auxiliary three-masted ship, built in 1922 by J. Th. Jorgensen at Thuro, Denmark. It was reportedly damaged by fire on 21 August 1955 and towed to Dover, where the fire was extinguished. In 1957 she passed into the ownership of the Atlas Diesel Co. and was towed out of Dover by the tug Westercock. She then spent some years in the Medway as a coal and/or grain hulk. She was then towed to Cubitt Town on the Thames. As the tug Fossa from Gravesend was towing her up Sea Reach the strain on the structure, which had become weakened over the years, proved too much, causing her to take in water and sink. After grounding on the Blyth Sands she was beached at Cliffe. Following a succession of storms, high tides and strong winds in December 2013, a large section of the ship's hull has now broken off and lies on the shore further round from the rest of the wreckage.

The film had its world premiere on 10 May 2013 at the Cape Fear Independent Film Festival and stars Liron Levo as a security operative sent to Lebanon on a final mission, only to discover that his opponents are of the dead. Cannon Fodder has been billed as Israel's \\"first full length zombie film\\". Synopsis Doron (Liron Levo) is a security operative sent to Lebanon with the mission to capture Manzur, one of the people in charge of the terrorist organization Hezbollah. He's promised that this will be his very last mission and that afterwards he will be left to build a family with his new wife. Fueled by this promise, Doron enters the town where his target is rumored to be hiding but soon discovers that it is filled with infected people intent on biting and spreading a strange new disease. Doron discovers Manzur's daughter Noelle (Yafit Shalev), who claims that her father had actually been working with Israel on a new biological weapon. Now Doron and the others must find a way to stay alive and get to safety. Cast *Liron Levo as Doron *Yafit Shalev as Noelle *Roi Miller as Daniel *Emos Ayeno as Moti *Amit Leor as Gideon *Shira Katzenelenbogen as Michal Production Gafny first came up with the initial idea for the film when he was 11 years old, when he viewed the George A. Romero films Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. He thought that it would be interesting to have a similar film set in Lebanon, featuring the Israel Defense Forces fighting zombies. Of the film's zombies, Gafny has stated that they are not meant to be seen as representative for either side of the Middle Eastern conflicts and that for him, the zombies represent hope. Funding for Cannon Fodder came from multiple sources, including Israeli government-affiliated film funds and a partially successful IndieGoGo campaign. The script's first draft took two weeks to complete and after re-writes and editing, the script for Cannon Fodder was completed in about three months. Reception Reviewers for Grolsch Film Works and What Culture both panned Cannon Fodder, and What Culture wrote \\"Though spritely shot, the first Israeli zombie flick does little to elevate itself above the garden variety entries to the genre, suffering from poor acting, a generic plot, and laughable visual effects.\\" In contrast, Ain't It Cool News and Nerdly both wrote favorable reviews for Cannon Fodder, and Nerdly commented \\"As surprising as much as it is stereotypical, Cannon Fodder is hands down THE best horror film to come out of Israel, easily surpassing Keshales and Papushado‚Äôs Rabies. For me Israeli horror has a new standard to live up to in Eitan Gafny‚Äôs superb zombie flick. =Awards= *Festival Prize for Best Feature Film at the Fright Night Film Fest (2013, won) *Festival Prize for Best Practical Special Effects at the Fright Night Film Fest (2013, won) References  Further reading  Ido Rosen.

Vere Poulett-Harris played five first-class cricket matches for the Tasmania and Western Australia cricket teams between 1883 and 1899. One early news report described him as a \\"sterling cricketer and footballer\\" whilst another described him as a \\"sterling batsman and good field.\\" Vere Poulett-Harris' father was Richard Deodatus Poulett-Harris, an educationalist, priest, the founder of the Masonic Lodge in Tasmania and the co-founder of the University of Tasmania. Amongst his other activities, Richard was passionate about cricket and, in 1882, was elected a trustee of the Southern Tasmanian Cricket Association. Furthermore, he encouraged the boys at the high school of which he was the headmaster to compete at sports. Vere Poulett-Harris left Tasmania to study medicine but ended up working for a time as a bank clerk at Charters Towers before becoming a gold prospector. By 1898, he was prospecting in Western Australia. He discovered the Corinthian gold mine in the Yilgarn Gold Field of Western Australia and was also one of the first people to prospect at Burtville. He wrote an account of the discovery of Corinthian which was published in a newspaper of the time. In 1911, he was called as a witness to testify during Chaffinch Mine Conspiracy trial. Vere Poulett-Harris' obituary states that he was \\"one of the outstanding athletes in the State, winning great success as a runner, cricketer and footballer. He played cricket for the Wellington Club and was regarded as one of the most graceful batsmen in the State. He was a member of the State team when a youth, and toured New Zealand with the Tasmanian team under the captaincy of the late Sir George Davies. Later he met with success as a batsman on the mainland. He was also a champion footballer and a member of the Cricketers' Football Club, some of his contemporaries being Messrs. W. H. Cundy, L. H. Macleod, K. E. Burn, A. Stuart and G. Watt. As a runner he defeated many of the recognised champions of his day.\\" He died aged 67, leaving no wife or children.

It was produced by K. K. Radha Mohan Sri Satya Sai Arts and features Ravi Teja, Tamannaah, and Raashi Khanna in the lead roles. Boman Irani, Nassar, Nagineedu, Rao Ramesh, and Sayaji Shinde play supporting roles. Bengal Tiger focuses on the conflict between two intelligent people.Akash Narayan, an unemployed graduate and Ashok Gajapati, the chief minister of the state. It also focuses on the roles played by agricultural minister Samba, home minister Nagappa, his daughter Shraddha, and Gajapati's daughter Meera in Akash's pursuit for revenge on Gajapati who killed his father. Nandi was initially supposed to direct Pawan Kalyan in Sardaar Gabbar Singh, the sequel of Gabbar Singh. The film was delayed and Nandi walked out, after which the pre-production of Bengal Tiger began. Nandi's prot√©g√© Bheems Ceciroleo composed the film's music. The film, whose cinematography was provided by Soundararajan, was edited by Gautham Raju. The film was officially launched on 30 January 2015 at Ramanaidu Studios. Principal photography commenced in March 2015 and lasted for 100 days until September 2015. Filming locations include Hyderabad, Rajahmundry, Pollachi and few locales of Europe, where a couple of songs were filmed. Produced on a budget of 250 million, Bengal Tiger was released globally on 10 December 2015 in 1000 screens. It received mixed reviews from the critics but was a commercial success, grossing nearly 405 million globally. The film was also dubbed into Hindi under the same name in 2016.The movie was being remade in Bengali Bangladesh as Bidrohi.  Plot  Akash Narayan is an unemployed simpleton living in Atreyapuram, who spends his time hanging out with friends. He is rejected by a girl who aspires to marry a famous person. This hurts Akash, and in an attempt to become famous, hits Agriculture Minister Samba with a stone. Initially angry, Samba is impressed with Akash's wit and employs him to escort home minister Nagappa's daughter Shraddha safely from the airport as her life is in danger. Upon Shraddha's suggestion, Nagappa appoints Akash as his . Shraddha gets engaged to Karan the son of politician Subba Rayudu. She, however, falls in love with Akash after a series of incidents. Shraddha rejects Karan and convinces Nagappa for the same. She adds that she would prefer to a like Akash to already financially settled person, as she finds the potential of making it big in Akash. On Shraddha's birthday, Nagappa hosts a big party and announces Akash as Shraddha's potential lover in the presence of many politicians, including the Chief Minister Ashok GajapathI . Akash, however, rejects Nagappa's presence and says that he loves Meera, Gajapathi's daughter, much to everyone's shock. When Shraddha confronts Akash, he says that their relationship is that of an employer and an employee and lies that he loved Meera, who rejected his love. Meera meets him shortly and proposes to him after being impressed with his eccentricity and spontaneity. When Gajapathi and Shraddha object, Meera defends her decision by saying that his logical thinking made her prefer Akash to others. Gajapathi then comes to know that Akash is his rival Jayanarayan's son and predicts that he is seeking revenge. Akash and Gajapathi have a formal meet where they have a deal; if Gajapathi fails to kill Akash within 24 hours using any means, he has to give his consent for Akash's marriage with Meera. Akash manages to survive in that 24 hours and meets Gajapathi again after the completion of the duration. When Gajapathi offers 5 billion to forego Meera, Akash accepts it happily and shifts the entire money to his house in Atreyapuram. When Meera and Shraddha probe into this, they find out that Jayanarayan was befriended by Gajapathi, a struggling politician then, and poisoned the priceless medicines supplied by Jayanarayan with the help of a company. The blame falls on Jayanarayan, who was killed by Gajapathi for political gain. Akash came to know this when he met the paternal uncle of the girl who rejected him initially and decides to seek revenge. Akash plans to use the money he received for development programmes in Atreyapuram on his father's death anniversary. Gajapathi is dethroned from the ministry, and his political career comes to an end after Akash provides the proofs for Gajapathi's illegal activities to the political party's executive committee, which he acquired from Gajapathi's secretary after bribing him. Gajapathi tries to kill Akash in Atreyapuram, after killing the uncle of the girl who rejected Akash, only to be attacked fatally by the local people, who are aware of his betrayal towards Jayanarayan. The film ends with Akash's marriage with Meera and the pandit, \\"Celebrity\\" Shastri, saying that the bride will have only two children but the groom would have four, which confuses everyone. Meera shows Shraddha, who is also dressed as the bride. Shastri asks if they will share everything if they are both friends, to which Shraddha replies that he played with them before marriage, and now it's their turn to play with him.

The film was delayed for years, and later, Sampath chose to direct Ravi Teja after walking out of that project. Ravi Teja confirmed the news and said that he would start working on this film after completing Kick 2 (2015). Previously, Nandi wrote the script keeping Ravi Teja in mind as the lead but had wanted to prove his abilities before working together. He chose to narrate the story of a man from Athreyapuram in Godavari district who comes on a mission to Hyderabad and his conflict with an intelligent chief minister. In an interview with The Hindu, Nandi specified it as a screenplay based film with a notable flashback episode. For this film, he adapted two fight sequences from the script written for the sequel of Gabbar Singh. The film was titled as Bengal Tiger and K. K.

Regarding her role, Khanna said that she would play an \\"intelligent girl\\" and shed weight for the same. She added that her subplot in the film, which explores the relationship she shares with her father (played by Rao Ramesh), has its \\"own importance in the overall scheme of things\\". Boman Irani was cast for a crucial supporting role. Posani Krishna Murali and Sayaji Shinde were cast for key supporting roles. Nassar was signed in on for a key supporting role as well.

Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu stated that Nandi \\"shines as a dialogue writer\\" and called the film \\"almost an epic\\" compared to Kick 2. Chowdary added, \\"Those seeking variety can stay away but those who go expecting their share of fun will not be disappointed\\". Sify gave 3 out of 5 stars and called Bengal Tiger a \\"regular mass entertainer with severe stress on comedy and glamour\\", adding, \\"Compared to recent Ravi Teja's movie, Bengal Tiger is more entertaining. The first half of the movie, Ravi Teja's antics, and Prudhvi are its strength\\" and pointed out that the second half \\"should have been better\\". The Hans India too gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and stated that Nandi \\"has come out with a full treat to mass audience\\", adding that the twist in the interval scene \\"takes the film to a new level\\". Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle too gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and called the film a \\"regular paisa vasool film with the right dose of masala and glamour\\", adding that it is \\"far more entertaining\\" compared to Kick 2 and a \\"good comeback\\" for Ravi Teja. Pravallika Anjuri of Oneindia gave the film 3 out of 5 stars as well and stated, \\"Though Bengal Tiger is a formulaic film, it is surely a complete 'Paisa Vasool' for masses, which makes it a perfect Mass Maharaj Ravi Teja's trademark film\\", adding that the cinematography and production values make Bengal Tiger a \\"technically good film too\\". IndiaGlitz also gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and called Bengal Tiger a \\"Ravi Teja-style power-packed performance, complete with comedy doses from Prithvi Raj and Posani, not to speak of punch lines of a different shade\\". Pranita Jonnalagedda of The Times of India gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and stated, \\"Sampath Nandi fails on many counts ‚Äî he failed to shape the characters on screen, underused performers with amazing potential ‚Äî Ravi Teja especially; and there is absolutely nothing to take home\\". S. S. Kamal of Bangalore Mirror too gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and stated, \\"Ravi Teja's charisma eventually prevents the film from being a complete disaster, making the first half in particular quite entertaining. If only Sampath Nandi had maintained the momentum right till the end, the result could have been so much better\\". Behindwoods gave 2.25 out of 5 stars and called the film a \\"worn-out no-brainer\\", adding that it is another \\"erratically fun outing\\" from Ravi Teja for whom there is \\"hardly a replacement\\" for \\"such weird, carefree yet lovable action hero roles\\". Karthik Keramalu of CNN-IBN gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and stated, \\"I found a giggling amount of comedy in ‚ÄòBengal Tiger. Focus on the funny bits. It won't matter if you doze off for the rest of the film though\\", adding that the film is a \\"mixture of good comedy and dull narration\\". Suhas Yellapantula of The New Indian Express gave the film 1.5 out of 5 stars and stated, \\"The film irritates you with its banality and angers you with its loudness. It seems as if every dialogue in the film is amplified ten-fold. The humour is colourless and makes you cringe\\". = Box office = Bengal Tiger which is regarded as a \\"hattrick hit\\" for director Sampath Nandi in the industry debuted with an average occupancy of 85% across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and grossed around 70 million with a distributor share of 53.6 million.

It has a dense head formed of gas and dust, which is around in diameter, and an elongated faint tail around in length. , and the nearby cometary globules, generally point away from the Vela Supernova Remnant, located at the center of the Gum Nebula.  Discovery  In 1976, photographs from the UK Schmidt Telescope‚Äîoperated by the Australian Astronomical Observatory‚Äîshowed several objects resembling comets, located in the Gum Nebula, an emission nebula of the constellation. Due to their particular shape, these objects came to be known as cometary globules. Each globule has a dense, dark, ruptured head and a very long tail, with the latter pointing away from the Vela Supernova Remnant. As a part of the ESO Cosmic Gems program, the European Southern Observatory released an image of in January 2015 showing the head of the nebula.  Structure  The head of cometary globule resembles a comet with a dusty cavernous mouth, as photographed by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in 2015. Composed of relatively dense, dark matter, it is an opaque structure that is being illuminated by the glow of a nearby star. An obscure red glow limbing the globule is possibly caused by emission from ionized hydrogen. The mouth of the globule appears to be ready to consume the edge-on spiral galaxy . In reality, the galaxy is over a hundred million light-years further away from the globule.

Early life  Henry Norman Davey was born in Malden in Surrey on 5 May 1888, the son of Henry Davey, a distinguished engineer and inventor, and his wife, Elizabeth Barbenson Le Ber, the daughter of Pierre Barbenson Le Ber, of Alderney, Channel Islands.Who Was Who, 1916 ‚Äì 1928 (London: A&C; Black Limited, 1929), p. 265.

Institution of Mechanical Engineers (London), Mechanical Engineering Records, 1847‚Äì1930. In 1907 he went up to Clare College, Cambridge. Although studying natural sciences, he soon began to display his lifelong interest and skill in creative writing. During the Michaelmas term of 1909 he served as co-editor of the university newspaper, Granta, and he achieved prominence as a student poet. He passed in the third class of the Natural Sciences Tripos, part I, and graduated with an honours degree in 1910.The Times (Friday, 17 June 1910), p. 12. F.A. Rice, The Granta And Its Contributors, 1889 1914 (1924), passim. Some of his poems were later reprinted in Cambridge Poets 1900‚Äì1913. An Anthology (Cambridge: W. Heffer & Sons Ltd., 1913). During the following year, 1911, he visited the United States, spending time particularly in Virginia and the Carolinas.G.M. Overton, When Winter Comes to Main Street (New York: George H. Doran Company, 1922), pp. 36‚Äì37. Then, returning to England, it seems he prepared to become a qualified and practising engineer. In June 1911 his father, acting on his behalf, had submitted an application for him to be elected as a Graduate of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. He himself sat, and passed, the examinations for associate membership of the Institution of Civil Engineers in February 1912.Institution of Mechanical Engineers (London), Mechanical Engineering Records, 1847‚Äì1930. The Times (Wednesday, 20 March 1912), p. 28.  Engineer and soldier Davey's father was a well-known engineer, and it is difficult to escape the conclusion that in going into the engineering profession he was conforming to his father's expectations. His sustained interest lay in writing. A somewhat patronising obituary in The Engineer commenced with the words, \\"Norman Davey will be remembered by those who have passed their meridian as the author of several light books well known in their day,\\" and went on to assert, \\"the only engineering work he did was the writing for this journal of two series of articles, which subsequently appeared in book form.\\"The Engineer (17 June 1949), p 667. At all events, in January 1914 he submitted an application to the British Patent office for a patent for a mixed fluid gas turbine,The Engineer (4 December 1914), p 545. and later that same year, his book, The Gas Turbine made its appearance,(London: Constable and Co., and New York: D. van Nostrand and Company, 1914) to favourable notices, such as, \\"This book is unquestionably the most comprehensive treatise on the gas turbine that has been published in the English language. ‚Ä¶ [This] interesting and comprehensive work by Mr. Davey is of especial interest.\\"Gas Age (vol. 36, 1915), p. 495. He was still travelling, studying and writing, however. During the year, 1914, he attended lectures at the Universit√© de Montpellier in France, and his first novel, Perhaps: A Tale of To-morrow, was accepted for publication by Methuen and Company. There is no clear evidence that this book was issued to the public, perhaps because of the onset of war, but it was advertised in the list of \\"Methuen's Popular Novels\\" for Autumn, 1914, scheduled for issue in September 1914, together with a synopsis of the plot.See for example the advertisements printed at the end of G.M. Ellison, An Englishwoman in a Turkish Harem (Methuen, 1915) [sic] and E. Lewis, Edward Carpenter; an exposition and an appreciation (Methuen, 1915) [sic] Great Britain's entrance into the First World War in August 1914, changed the course of Davey's life. On 6 October 1914 he attested for service in the Territorial Force as a Sapper in the London Electrical Engineers, Royal Engineers. In November he completed an \\"Application for Appointment to a Temporary Commission in the Regular Army for the Period of the War,\\" and he was appointed and commissioned as a temporary Second Lieutenant in the Royal Garrison Artillery on 5 December 1914. After little more than a month, on 20 January 1915, he was transferred to the Royal Engineers. He crossed to France on 14 September 1915.National Archives, War Office: Soldiers‚Äô Documents, First World War ‚ÄòBurnt Documents‚Äô; Officers' Services, First World War, Long Number Papers, 'Captain Henry Norman Davey' (reference WO 339/16155); Service Medal and Award Rolls Index, First World War (reference WO 372/5/173287). Initially he served with the Signal Service on operations in France and Flanders, describing himself as \\"The Only Subaltern Who Has Instructed The Director of Army Signals in the Use of the Telephone\\" in a humorous article entitled \\"The Telephone at the Front,\\" which appeared in Punch in November 1915.17 November 1915. He was posted to Fifth Army Signals after that formation came into existence, and, later in the war, to General Headquarters, British Armies in France, to do duty on attachment with General Staff (Training). He returned to England in June 1918, where, after a prolonged period of ill-health, he served as a General staff Officer, 3rd Grade, under the Assistant Director of Staff Duties (Education) at the War Office, with the rank of Captain. He was demobilised and released from the Army in March 1919. He was mentioned in despatches in April 1917,Supplement to the London Gazette, 18 May 1917, p. 4877. and favourably referred to by Lord Gorell in his book, Education and the Army.Education and the Army ‚Äì an essay in reconstruction (1921), p. 62. Professional writer Although Davey was elected as an Associate Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in March 1919,Institution of Mechanical Engineers (London), Mechanical Engineering Records, 1847‚Äì1930. he spent the post-war years travelling in Italy and France, and writing. Within a few years a note appeared in T.P.'s and Cassell's Weekly that, \\"being a wanderer by instinct and inclination, [he] is a frequent visitor to Italy, but he has a pied-a-terre at Ewell, in Surrey.\\"T.P.'s and Cassell's Weekly (vol. 1) (1923), p. 348. His note, \\"Italian Water Turbines,\\" appeared in The Engineer in November 1919. Four of his poems appeared in 1920 in Cambridge Poets 1914‚Äì1920. An Anthology,Cambridge: W. Heffer & Sons Ltd., 1920. and that same year saw the publication of his own volume of poems, Desiderium, MCMXV- MCMXVIII. Cambridge: W. Heffer & Sons Ltd., 1920. Then, in 1921, appeared what was unquestionably to be his most successful achievement, the novel, The Pilgrim of a Smile.London: Chapman and Hall, 1921. The book was at once well- received, one critic remarking, \\"Mr. Norman Davey‚Äôs book of short stories‚Äîstories of the adventures of that quiet gentleman Mr. Matthew Sumner‚Äî are in the best tradition of Stevenson and Mr. Chesterton. We do not mean that Mr. Davey is a copyist, for the Stevensonian seam is a rich one and the master himself by no means exhausted it. Mr. Davey, in adopting the same careful, ornately simple style and many of the same methods for the production of his surprise, is well within his rights. One of the most delightful things about this book is that many of the adventures related are adventures not of the body but of the spirit.‚Äù The Spectator(12 February 1921), p. 210. The book has been reprinted many times since its first publication, appearing as a Penguin Book in 1936. Ten novels were to follow The Pilgrim of a Smile, but few of them were regarded with quite as much admiration. His very next book, for example, was roughly treated: \\"Most of Mr. Norman Davey‚Äôs readers will expect a good deal from a full-length novel by the author of The Pilgrim of a Smile; they will be disappointed.\\"The Spectator (10 December 1921), p. 23. It must be said that the same book was referred to as \\"very smart\\" in the Aberdeen Journal of Tuesday, 23 October 1934 (on page 2). Two of his non-fiction titles received good notices, however. Studies in Tidal Power, an engineering work, which was published in 1923,London: Constable and Co., 1923 and the travel guide, The Hungry Traveller in France, which appeared in 1931.With illustrations by P. Minouvis and maps (London: Jonathan Cape, 1931). \\"P. Minouvis\\" was the nom de plume of Paul Eberbach (1897‚Äì1977), a Swiss cartoonist and illustrator. Like Davey, he was a civil engineer by training. Marriages, retirement and death Davey was married on 7 September 1926 in the British Consulate, Marseilles in France to Violet Ada Lucy Fergusson (the only daughter of John Henry Fergusson of Crochmore, Dumfriesshire in Scotland.

It arises in response to phase changes within the network of connections formed by a system's components. DPE occurs in a wide range of physical, biological and social systems. Its applications to technology include methods for manufacturing novel materials and algorithms to solve complex problems in computation.  Introduction  Dual phase evolution (DPE) is a process that promotes the emergence of large-scale order in complex systems. It occurs when a system repeatedly switches between various kinds of phases, and in each phase different processes act on the components or connections in the system. DPE arises because of a property of graphs and networks: the connectivity avalanche that occurs in graphs as the number of edges increases. Social networks provide a familiar example. In a social network the nodes of the network are people and the network connections (edges) are relationships or interactions between people. For any individual, social activity alternates between a local phase, in which they interact only with people they already know, and a global phase in which they can interact with a wide pool of people not previously known to them. Historically, these phases have been forced on people by constraints of time and space. People spend most of their time in a local phase and interact only with those immediately around them (family, neighbors, colleagues). However, intermittent activities such as parties, holidays, and conferences involve a shift into a global phase where they can interact with different people they do not know. Different processes dominate each phase. Essentially, people make new social links when in the global phase, and refine or break them (by ceasing contact) while in the local phase.  The DPE mechanism  The following features are necessary for DPE to occur. = Underlying network = DPE occurs where a system has an underlying network. That is, the system's components form a set of nodes and there are connections (edges) that join them. For example, a family tree is a network in which the nodes are people (with names) and the edges are relationships such as \\"mother of\\" or \\"married to\\". The nodes in the network can take physical form, such as atoms held together by atomic forces, or they may be dynamic states or conditions, such as positions on a chess board with moves by the players defining the edges. In mathematical terms (graph theory), a graph \\\\textstyle G = \\\\langle N,E\\\\rangle is a set of nodes \\\\textstyle N and a set of edges \\\\textstyle E \\\\subset { (x,y) \\\\mid x,y \\\\in N }. Each edge \\\\textstyle (x,y ) provides a link between a pair of nodes \\\\textstyle x and \\\\textstyle y. A network is a graph in which values are assigned to the nodes and/or edges. = Phase shifts = Graphs and networks have two phases: disconnected (fragmented) and connected. In the connected phase every node is connected by an edge to at least one other node and for any pair of nodes, there is at least one path (sequence of edges) joining them. The Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model shows that random graphs undergo a connectivity avalanche as the density of edges in a graph increases. This avalanche amounts to a sudden phase change in the size of the largest connected subgraph. In effect, a graph has two phases: connected (most nodes are linked by pathways of interaction) and fragmented (nodes are either isolated or form small subgraphs). These are often referred to as global and local phases, respectively. Fragmented graph. Connected graph. An essential feature of DPE is that the system undergoes repeated shifts between the two phases. In many cases, one phase is the system's normal state and it remains in that phase until shocked into the alternate phase by a disturbance, which may be external in origin. = Selection and variation = In each of the two phases, the network is dominated by different processes. In a local phase, the nodes behave as individuals; in the global phase, nodes are affected by interactions with other nodes. Most commonly the two processes at work can be interpreted as variation and selection. Variation refers to new features, which typically appear in one of the two phases. These features may be new nodes, new edges, or new properties of the nodes or edges. Selection here refers to ways in which the features are modified, refined, selected or removed. A simple example would be new edges being added at random in the global phase and edges being selectively removed in the local phase. = System memory = The effects of changes in one phase carry over into the other phase. This means that the processes acting in each phase can modify or refine patterns formed in the other phase. For instance, in a social network, if a person makes new acquaintances during a global phase, then some of these new social connections might survive into the local phase to become long-term friends. In this way, DPE can create effects that may be impossible if both processes act at the same time.  Examples  DPE has been found to occur in many natural and artificial systems. = Social networks = DPE is capable of producing social networks with known topologies, notably small-world networks and scale-free networks. Small world networks, which are common in traditional societies, are a natural consequence of alternating local and global phases: new, long- distance links are formed during the global phase and existing links are reinforced (or removed) during the local phase. The advent of social media has decreased the constraining influence that space used to impose on social communication, so time has become the chief constraint for many people. The alternation between local and global phases in social networks occurs in many different guises. Some transitions between phases occur regularly, such as the daily cycle of people moving between home and work. This alternation can influence shifts in public opinion. In the absence of social interaction, the uptake of an opinion promoted by media is a Markov process. The effect of social interaction under DPE is to retard the initial uptake until the number converted reaches a critical point, after which uptake accelerates rapidly. = Socio-economics = DPE models of socio-economics interpret the economy as networks of economic agents. Several studies have examined the way socioeconomics evolve when DPE acts on different parts of the network. One model interpreted society as a network of occupations with inhabitants matched to those occupations. In this model social dynamics become a process of DPE within the network, with regular transitions between a development phase, during which the network settles into an equilibrium state, and a mutating phase, during which the network is transformed in random ways by the creation of new occupations. Another model interpreted growth and decline in socioeconomic activity as a conflict between cooperators and defectors. The cooperators form networks that lead to prosperity. However, the network is unstable and invasions by defectors intermittently fragment the network, reducing prosperity, until invasions of new cooperators rebuild networks again. Thus prosperity is seen as a dual phase process of alternating highly prosperous, connected phases and unprosperous, fragmented phases. = Forest ecology = In a forest, the landscape can be regarded as a network of sites where trees might grow. Some sites are occupied by living trees; others sites are empty. In the local phase, sites free of trees are few and they are surrounded by forest, so the network of free sites is fragmented. In competition for these free sites, local seed sources have a massive advantage, and seeds from distant trees are virtually excluded. Major fires (or other disturbances) clear away large tracts of land, so the network of free sites becomes connected and the landscape enters a global phase. In the global phase, competition for free sites is reduced, so the main competitive advantage is adaptation to the environment. Most of the time a forest is in the local phase, as described above. The net effect is that established tree populations largely exclude invading species. Even if a few isolated trees do find free ground, their population is prevented from expanding by established populations, even if the invaders are better adapted to the local environment. A fire in such conditions leads to an explosion of the invading population, and possibly to a sudden change in the character of the entire forest. This dual phase process in the landscape explains the consist appearance of pollen zones in the postglacial forest history of North America, Europe, as well as the suppression of widespread taxa, such as beech and hemlock, followed by huge population explosions. Similar patterns, pollen zones truncated by fire- induced boundaries, have been recorded in most parts of the world = Search algorithms = Dual phase evolution is a family of search algorithms that exploit phase changes in the search space to mediate between local and global search. In this way they control the way algorithms explore a search space, so they can be regarded as a family of metaheuristic methods. Problems such as optimization can typically be interpreted as finding the tallest peak (optimum) within a search space of possibilities. The task can be approached in two ways: local search (e.g. hill climbing) involves tracing a path from point to point, and always moving \\"uphill\\". Global search involves sampling at wide-ranging points in the search space to find high points. Many search algorithms involve a transition between phases of global search and local search. A simple example is the Great Deluge algorithm in which the searcher can move at random across the landscape, but cannot enter low-lying areas that are flooded. At first the searcher can wander freely, but rising water levels eventually confine the search to a local area. Many other nature-inspired algorithms adopt similar approaches. Simulated annealing achieves a transition between phases via its cooling schedule. The cellular genetic algorithm places solutions in a pseudo landscape in which they breed only with local neighbours. Intermittent disasters clear patches, flipping the system into a global phase until gaps are filled again. Some variations on the memetic algorithm involve alternating between selection at different levels. These are related to the Baldwin effect, which arises when processes acting on phenotypes (e.g. learning) influence selection at the level of genotypes. In this sense, the Baldwin effect alternates between global search (genotypes) and local search (phenotypes).  Related processes  Dual phase evolution is related to the well-known phenomenon of self-organized criticality (SOC). Both concern processes in which critical phase changes promote adaptation and organization within a system. However, SOC differs from DPE in several fundamental ways. Under SOC, a system's natural condition is to be in a critical state; in DPE a system's natural condition is a non-critical state. In SOC the size of disturbances follows a power law; in DPE disturbances are not necessarily distributed the same way. In SOC a system is not necessarily subject to other processes; in DPE different processes (e.g. selection and variation) operate in the two phases.

In the Late Middle Ages, the bulk of possessions of the order were in the Holy Roman Empire, France, Castile, Aragon and Portugal, but they extended into Poland, Hungary, southern Italy, England and Denmark, with individual outliers in Ireland, Scotland, Sweden and Greece (the main seat of the order was in Rhodes from 1310 until 1522, and in Malta from 1530 until 1798). Pre-Reformation Before the Protestant Reformation, the Order was divided into seven langues or tongues. The langues were divided into great priories, some of which were further divided into priories or bailiwicks (ballei), and these were in turn divided into commanderies. The largest of the langues by far was the \\"German\\" one, which included not only all of the Holy Roman Empire but also the non‚ÄìGerman-speaking (Slavic and Hungarian) territories east of Germany. It was divided into five great-priories, the largest of which were Austria-Bohemia and Germany, in turn, divided into major priories or bailiwicks; one of the largest such became independent after the Protestant Reformation as the Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg). The division of Latin Europe, on the other hand, was more fine-grained, into the Hispanic (Iberian peninsula, at first known as the \\"Aragonese\\" langue, but in 1462 split into the Aragonese and the \\"Castilian\\" langue, the latter including Castille, L√©on and Portugal), Italian (Italian peninsula), Proven√ßal, Auvergnat and French langues. Finally, the English langue included the order's possessions in the British Isles. =German tongue= Commanderies of the German tongue in 1300 *great priory Bohemia-Austria **priory Bohemia: commanderies ƒåesk√Ω Dub, B≈ôezina, Glatz, Kada≈à, Manƒõt√≠n, Pfaden, Ploschkowitz, Prague, Strakonice, Mies **priory Moravia: commanderies Brno, Maidelberg, Ti≈°nov, Opava **priory Silesia: commanderies Beilau, Breslau, Brieg, Goldberg, Gr√∂bnig bei Leobsch√ºtz, Gro√ü-Tinz, Klein-√ñls, L√∂wenberg, Reichenbach, Striegau **priory Oberlausitz: commanderies Zittau, Hirschfelde **priory Archducal Austria: commanderies Mailberg, Laa an der Thaya, Lockenhaus, Vienna **priory Inner Austria: commanderies Altenmarkt, Feldbach, F√ºrstenfeld, Graz, Komenda, Melling, Marburg, Pulst, √úbersbach *great priory Germany: The great priory of Germany was divided into eight bailiwicks (Balleien).

Paul's election as Grand Master was, however, never ratified under Roman Catholic canon law, and he was the de facto rather than de jure Grand Master of the Order. The commandry system survives into the present era, but since the Protestant Reformation the order is split into the four \\"Alliance orders\\" of the German Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg), the British Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, the Swedish Johanniterorden i Sverige, and the Dutch Johanniter Orde in Nederland, the Order forms the Alliance of the Orders of St. John of Jerusalem and the Roman Catholic Sovereign Military Order of Malta. The German (Brandenburg) branch comprises seventeen commandries in Germany, one each in Austria, Finland, France, Hungary, and Switzerland, and a global commandry with subcommandries in twelve other countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Italy, Namibia, Poland, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela).Verzeichnis der Mitglieder der Balley Brandenburg des Ritterlichen Ordens St. Johannis vom Spital zu Jerusalem; Berlin: Johanniterorden, October, 2011; pages 22-23. Following constitutional changes made in 1999, the Priory of England and The Islands was established (including the Commandery of Ards in Northern Ireland) alongside the existing Priories of Wales, Scotland, Canada, Australia (including the Commandery of Western Australia), New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States. In 2013, the Priory of Kenya and in 2014 the Priory of Singapore were formed. Each is governed by a Prior and a Priory Chapter. Commanderies, governed by a Knight or Dame Commander and a Commandery Chapter, may exist within or wholly or partly without the territory of a priory, known as Dependent or Independent Commanderies, respectively. Any country without a priory or commandery of its own is assumed into the \\"home priory\\" of England and The Islands, many of these being smaller Commonwealth of Nations states in which the order has only a minor presence.

Found in Tunisia, the ants inhabit salt pans where they forage dead arthropods. Navigation skills and internal pedometer =Measuring the sun's angle= This ant ventures far from its burrow in the Sahara Desert, which has almost no identifiable features. While venturing out it periodically takes measurements of its angle in respect to the Sun. By doing this the ant can venture far from its nest in search of food. Because of the blistering heat, it can only do this for about 3‚Äì5 minutes/day (the hottest time of the day, when all its predators are in hiding from the sun). When the ant finds a dead insect it then looks at the sun and because of its periodic references to the sun's angle it knows exactly what the shortest route back to the nest is. Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology have also verified that desert microhabitats have unique odour signatures that can guide the ants back to the nest. This skill, which has also been observed in the behavior of foraging honey bees, is elemental to the survival of this species of ant under the harsh conditions in which it lives. This behavior allows Cataglyphis to travel farther from its nest than any other creature that lives in the Sahara, with respect to size. =Pedometer= The ant appears to use an internal pedometer to count its steps in a harsh environment where odors quickly vanish, enabling it to \\"count back\\" to its nest. When stilts were glued on to the ants legs, they overshot the distance of their nests, while ants with cut legs traveled short of their nest. It's suspected that while the ants unlikely have the brainpower to literally count steps, they are somehow doing it intuitively. = Food memory = Cataglyphis fortis is capable, as well, of memorizing up to 14 different food odors which seemingly exceeds its requirements for survival. Workers from a colony were presented with several different food odors and were observed to remember them for up to 25 days following their initial introduction to the odor, which exceeds the average expected lifespan of about six days before they tend to be killed by predators. Researchers were consequentially stunned that ants who had reached over four times the average expected age could still remember what they learned. Puzzled at this, they reasoned that it makes sense due to food being unpredictable, and the ants may come across several different food items in a single foraging run while nest scents tend to remain the same and will not drastically change during any given ant's lifetime.

Based on the 1994 autobiographic novel Boken om E (The Book about E) by Swedish author Ulla Isaksson, the film's themes are loss and Alzheimer's disease. Plot Martin Fischer is a successful composer. During a rehearsal for an upcoming concert he makes contact with first-violinist Barbara Hartman. During the concert, Barbara and Martin flirt a lot with each other, although they are both married and have adult children. After the concert, they meet out back. She feels ill, and he says that he will follow her home. They stop at his hotel and go inside, kiss, and Barbara says she loves him. Somewhat later, she tells her two adult children that she is going to separate from the children's father. Phillip, the son, becomes very angry, while her daughter Karin is more indulgent. The film jumps to Barbara's honeymoon with Martin in Morocco. After they return home, Martin experiences amnesia, and is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. The doctor says they should try to live as they always have lived. They go to a restaurant, but Martin will have to pay twice, and it destroys the good mood as he feels humiliated. His condition worsens. He is working on an opera, soon to be completed. After working all night, he claims that he is finally finished. He asks Barbara to go to the post office and send the score to his manager. On the way to the post office Barbara opens the envelope to look it through, and she realizes that it's a mess, and that several of the pages are completely blank. Barbara and the manager Biederman agree to pretend that the opera will be performed. Martin and Barbara again go on vacation to Morocco, but Martin is now too affected by the disease. One morning he is gone, and Barbara finds him sitting at a caf√© with no pants on. Later they are out swimming and he forgets how to swim. Barbara grabs him, but he's too heavy for her, he pulls her under the water, but they are saved from drowning by some lifeguards. When they return home to Sweden, they attend Mozart's opera The Magic Flute. Suddenly Martin stands up and begins to sing along. Barbara gets him out of the theater. At night, he gets out of bed, goes to the living room and smashes Barbara's precious violin. She hits him while crying. Martin basically needs help with everything now. His birthday is celebrated at a restaurant. Martin begins to urinate in a plant, and when Barbara tries to get him to stop, he becomes angry. Eventually he just lies quiet in bed and only reacts when he hears that Barbara opens a box of chocolates. The film ends with Martin's concert with Barbara playing the violin.

Described in 1846, it is known only from the Mediterranean parts of France. Reproduction Parthenogenesis is a natural form of reproduction in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilization. Thelytoky is a particular form of parthenogenesis in which the development of a female individual occurs from an unfertilized egg. Automixis is a form of thelytoky, but there are several kinds of automixis. The kind of automixis relevant here is one in which two haploid products from the same meiosis combine to form a diploid zygote. Central fusion and terminal fusion automixis The process of automictic thelytoky with central fusion has been studied in C. cursor. Central fusion allows heterozygosity to be largely maintained. Queen ants use this process to produce female reproductive progeny (gynes), thus increasing the transmission of their own genes through the germline lineage. Also, queens use sexual reproduction to produce worker ants. In C. cursor colonies with a single queen, 96.4% of daughter queens arise from thelytokous parthenogenetic eggs, while 97.9% of daughter workers arise from fertilized eggs.  Subspecies Besides the type subspecies, the following three are recognized: * Cataglyphis cursor subsp. aterrimus Pisarski, 1967 * Cataglyphis cursor subsp. creticus (Forel, 1910) * Cataglyphis cursor subsp. rockingeri (Forel, 1911) References Category:Formicinae Category:Hymenoptera of Europe Category:Insects described in 1846 Category:Taxa named by √âtienne Laurent Joseph Hippolyte Boyer de Fonscolombe ","title":"Cataglyphis cursor"},{"id":"45265514","text":"Edward Stiles Stokes (1841‚Äì1901) Edward Stiles Stokes (April 27, 1841 -‚Äì November 2, 1901) was the owner of a New York oil refinery. In 1872, he shot and killed his business partner and love rival James Fisk. Stokes was tried three times and found guilty of manslaughter in the third degree, serving four years in prison. Later he became the proprietor of the fashionable Hoffman House Hotel. Early life His father was Edward Halesworth Stokes, who had owned a New York cloth business.The cloth business was in partnership with his brother James Boulter Stokes and had been started by their father, Thomas Stokes, who had arrived from England in about 1798. By 1838 the father had made sufficient money to retire and move with his wife, Nancy Stiles, to Philadelphia.Nancy Stiles was from Philadelphia and descended from Richard Stockton, lieutenant in 1665 of the Long Island Troop of Horse Their son, Edward Stiles Stokes, was born on April 27, 1840. He was educated in Philadelphia and later New York before starting business, first in a junior position with Samuel Perry, and later in partnership with Jenks Budlong, manufacturing and selling cheese. In 1862 he married Maria Southack, daughter of John W. Southack, wealthy furniture manufacturer of New York.Newspaper reporting the murder of James Fisk and the ensuing court case, referred to Stokes father-in-law as J. W. Southwich. Oil refinery In 1865 Stokes was operating an oil refinery in Brooklyn at Hunters Point. He sought funding and acquired two investors, Henry Harley and William A. Byers. Another provider of funds was a \\"silent partner\\", James Fisk, who operated the Erie Railroad and had a secret arrangement with Stokes to discount freight charges for the refinery. Fisk and Stokes shared the affections of the same woman, Helen Josephine Mansfield, and this caused animosity between the two men. In January 1871 Fisk arranged to have Stokes arrested for embezzling funds from the refinery. He also took over the refinery by force and obtained injunctions to prevent Stokes and his mother, who owned the site, from entering the premises. The charge was dismissed and Stokes was later awarded $10,000 compensation. Stokes was dissatisfied with the award and threatening to publish incriminating letters from Fisk unless he was paid substantially more. Fisk obtained another injunction to prevent the publication, claiming he was being blackmailed. Soon after, Stokes found out that Fisk had indicted him for attempted blackmail with the Grand Jury. On January 6, 1872, Fisk was visiting the Grand Central Hotel, lower Broadway, when Stokes met him on the stairs and shot him twice. He died the next day. The trial Stokes was arrested and tried on three occasions. He claimed he shot in self-defence, and a gun later found in a sofa at the hotel gave credibility to his assertion that Fisk had a weapon. At the first trial the jury could not agree on a verdict. The second was declared a mistrial and on the third occasion he was found guilty of manslaughter. He was sentenced to four years and sent to Sing Sing Prison and later Auburn Prison, from where he was released in October 1876. Stokes's father had died whilst he was in prison and his wife had been taken to Europe by her father during the period of the trials. Life after release Before his incarceration, Stokes and his family had lived in the Hoffman House Hotel, corner of Twenty-fifth Street and Broadway. The proprietor, Cassius H Read, was a friend to Stokes during his trial and after his release made him a partner in the hotel. Stokes became quarrelsome and took court actions against many of those that had helped him including Read. He also had a long running battle with his cousin, W. E. D. Stokes, although shortly before his death they made up their differences. Death and burial Stokes died in New York City on November 2, 1901. He was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.

He claimed the English lightweight title two months later after a draw with Alf Reed. With titles coming under the jurisdiction of the National Sporting Club, Joseph won his first regulated title in October 1908, beating Corporal Bill Baker to take the English welterweight title (later known as the British welterweight title). He took a 20-round points decision over Young Otto in April 1909, claiming the 142 lbs world title. He successfully defended his British title against Jack Goldswain in March 1910.

He ascended the throne after his father's death and was succeeded by his younger brother, Harsha. Contemporary information regarding the life of Rajyavardhana is limited in scope and utility. He is mentioned by Xuanzang, the Chinese traveller, and in Harshacharita, a seventh-century CE work by the poet and bard BƒÅ·πáabha·π≠·π≠a. Neither offer impartial accounts and they differ in substantive details. The military historian Kaushik Roy describes Harshacharita as \\"historical fiction\\" but with a factually correct foundation. Rajyavardhana was the elder of two sons of Prabhakarvardhana and his queen, Yasomati. The couple also had a daughter, Rajyashri, who married Grahavarman, a member of the Maukhari ruling family at Kannauj. Prabhakarvardana was the powerful ruler of the Thanesar region around 585-606 CE, although exact dates are uncertain. The historian Ramesh Chandra Majumdar says he died and was succeeded by Rajyavardhana in 604 CE but Kaushik Roy gives 606 CE as the year, and some sources say 605. Prabhakarvardhana had expanded his territory by defeating rulers in Gujarat, Gandhara and Sind, and he had also resisted the invasion of the Huna people. He died while his sons were fighting the Hunas. The marriage alliance of Grahavarman and Rajyashri had strengthened ties between the families to a point that Shashanka, the ruler of the Gauda kingdom in Bengal, found unacceptable. He retaliated by allying with the Malava kingdom and the forces appear to have launched a successful surprise attack on the Maukhari capital at Kannauj. Grahavarman was killed and Rajyashri captured at this time, which caused Rajyavardhana to retaliate in turn. He commanded a 10,000-strong cavalry force that was successful in defeating the Malava ruler, with the main army of infantry and war elephants supporting it under the charge of his younger brother, Harsha. Rajyavardhana's success was against an advance guard of his enemy. He died later in 606 as he made his way onwards to press an action at Kannauj itself. He was perhaps murdered by Shashanka, who may have invited him to a meeting with treachery in mind, although the only sources for this claim are BƒÅ·πáabha·π≠·π≠a and Xuanzang, who both had reasons to write unfavourably of Shashanka. Harsha succeeded Rajyavardhana as ruler of Thanesar and vowed to avenge his brother's death.

The century saw the construction of Place Vend√¥me, the Place de la Concorde, the Champs-√âlys√©es, the church of Les Invalides, and the Panth√©on, and the founding of the Louvre Museum. Paris witnessed the end of the reign of Louis XIV, was the center stage of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, saw the first manned flight, and was the birthplace of high fashion and the modern restaurant. View of Paris from the Pont Neuf (1763) View of Place Louis XV (now Place de la Concorde) from the Left Bank, attributed to Alexandre-Jean No√´l (about 1780) Paris at the end of the reign of Louis XIV Louis XIV makes his last visit to Paris to see the new dome of Les Invalides (1706) =\\"The new Rome\\"= Louis XIV distrusted the Parisians; when he was young he had been forced to flee the city twice, and he did not forget it. He moved his residence from the Tuileries Palace to the Palace of Versailles in 1671, and moved his entire court to Versailles in 1682. But while he disliked the Parisians, he wanted Paris to be a monument to his glory; he declared in 1666 that he wished to \\"do for Paris what Augustus had done for Rome.\\" He decorated the city with new squares and public buildings; the Coll√®ge des Quatre-Nations (1662‚Äì1672); the Pont Royal in 1685, and in the same year began construction of two new monumental squares: Place des Victoires and Place Louis le Grand, (now Place Vend√¥me). He also began the H√¥tel des Invalides (1671‚Äì1678), a residence and hospital for wounded soldiers. In 1699, a monumental equestrian statue of the King was dedicated in the center of the place Vend√¥me. During his reign, Louis XIV spent more than 200 million livres for new buildings, of which ten percent was spent in Paris; ten million for rebuilding the Louvre and the Tuileries; 3.5 million for the new factories of Gobelins and the Savonnerie; and a little more than 2 million for Les Invalides. Several new churches were also begun during the reign of Louis XIV, but not finished until well into the 18th century; these included the Church of Saint-Sulpice, whose cornerstone was laid by the Queen, Anne of Austria, in 1646, but not finished until 1745; the Church of Saint-Roch, begun in 1653 and finished in 1740; the church of Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet (1656‚Äì1765); and the church of Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin (1683‚Äì1770). Place Royale, now Place des Vosges, in 1709. The square was a fashionable area until the French Revolution, though most of the nobility have left beyond Saint-Germain des Pres during the early 18th century Louis XIV also made a dramatic change to the borders of the city; he decided that Paris wasn't secure from any enemy attack, and had the old ring of walls and fortifications demolished. The old city gates were replaced by ceremonial arches, celebrating his victories; the Porte Saint-Denis (1672) and Porte Saint-Martin (1674). The walls were pulled down and replaced by wide boulevards, which in the 18th century became the most popular promenades for Parisians. The administration of the city was complicated and deliberately divided, designed to keep the city tightly under royal authority. The position of Governor of Paris, held by a duke, was purely ceremonial, as was the position of the Provost of Paris, earlier held by a leading merchant, but in the early 18th century by a nobleman. Their powers were shared with the Intendant of Paris, a high noble with rather vague duties, the Bureau of the City, the Procureur-General of the Parliament, the Civil Lieutenant of the Ch√¢telet, and the Secretary of State of the King's Household, who had the title \\"Minister of Paris\\", but reported to the Controller General of Finances. The position of Lieutenant-General of Police of Paris was created in 1667, and given to Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie, the first police chief of the city, and he became a sort of Vice-Minister. All of these officials were responsible for some part of the city's business, but all important decisions had to be made by the King and his council. Despite the grandeur of the new monuments, the center of the city at the beginning of the 18th century was overcrowded, dark, unhealthy, and had little light, air, or drinking water. It was also dangerous, despite the addition of the first metal lanterns on the main streets and the enlargement of the police night watch to four hundred men. The last years of the King's long reign were marked by natural catastrophes which caused great suffering for the Parisians; they began with a bad harvest followed by a famine in the winter of 1692-1693. Dozens of large ovens were built in the courtyard of the Louvre to bake bread for the poor, but the distribution of the loaves at central points around the city resulted in fighting and riots. That winter, fourteen or fifteen people a day died of hunger at the H√¥tel Dieu hospital next to the Cathedral of Notre- Dame. Another bad harvest and severe winter hit Paris in 1708-1709, with temperatures reaching below 20 degrees Celsius. The Seine froze from January 26 until April 5, making it impossible to deliver grain to the city by boat. During the summer of 1709, the government announced the creation of workshops for the poor and unemployed, who would receive 1.5 pounds of bread and two sous for each day of work. Six thousand persons lined up before dawn near the Porte Saint-Martin for two thousand available jobs. Riots followed, the crowds attacked Les Halles, and Musketeers had to occupy the main streets and squares to restore order. Placards criticizing the King and his government began to appear on the city gates, the churches and the main squares. On 28 August 1706 Louis XIV made his last visit to Paris to see the construction of the new chapel, with a great gilded dome, he was building for the H√¥tel des Invalides. He died on September 1, 1715. Louis de Rouvroy, the Duke of Saint-Simon wrote in his memoirs that, at the news of the King's death, \\"the people, ruined, crippled, desperate, gave thanks to God.\\" Paris under Louis XV Louis XV, five years old and the new King, makes a grand exit from the Royal Palace on the √éle de la Cit√© (1715). Immediately following the death of Louis XIV, his nephew, Philippe d'Orl√©ans, manoeuvered the Parlement into breaking the King's will and naming him the Regent for the five-year-old king Louis XV. On 12 September, the Regent had the child King brought to the Palais de Justice to ratify his Regency, and then to the Ch√¢teau de Vincennes. On 30 December, the young King was installed in the Tuileries Palace, while the Regent took up residence in his family's palace, the Palais Royal, the former Palais-Cardinal of Cardinal Richelieu. Under the Regent, the pleasures and amusements forbidden in Paris during the last years of Louis XIV were resumed. The Com√©die-Italienne theater company had been banned from Paris in 1697 for presenting a thinly disguised satire about the King's wife, Madame de Maintenon, called La Fausse Prude. The Regent invited the company back and that they perform at the Palais-Royal on 18 May 1716. The company moved to their own stage, the Th√©√¢tre-Italien in the H√¥tel de Bourgogne, where they performed in his presence on 1 June 1716. In November 1716, the pleasure- loving Regent brought back another Paris amusement, the masked balls; these were held three times a week at the opera hall of the Palais-Royal. Masks were obligatory; a high admission charge of four livres kept out undesirable guests. The young King was educated in Paris under the guidance of the Regent. He played on the terrace of the Tuileries Garden, had his own private zoo, and a room filled with scientific instruments telescopes, microscopes, compasses, mirrors, and models of the planets, where he was instructed by members of the Academy of Sciences. A printing press was installed in the palace for him to learn typography. He was taken hunting in the Bois de Boulogne and the Bois de Vincennes. In 1720, and 1721, when he was just ten, the young King himself danced before for the court and public in ballet performances in the Salle des Machines of the Tuileries Palace. The Regent also made an important contribution to the intellectual life of Paris. In 1719, he moved the Royal library to the H√¥tel de Nevers near the Palais-Royal, where it eventually became the Biblioth√®que nationale de France (National Library of France). The king and government remained in Paris for seven years. =Monuments= Design of Ange-Jacques Gabriel for Place Louis XV, now the Place de la Concorde In 1722, Louis XV returned the court to Versailles, and visited the city only on special occasions.Sarmant, Thierry, Histoire de Paris, pp. 117-118 While he rarely came into Paris, he did make important additions to the city's landmarks. His first major building was the √âcole Militaire, a new military school, on the Left Bank. Work began in 1753 and was completed in 1760, when the King first visited it. A chapel for the school was begun in 1768, and finished in 1773. Louis XIV had promised to build a new church dedicated to Saint Genevieve, but it had never gotten underway. Louis XV laid the first stone for the new church on 6 September 1764. For the opening, a temporary portico of light materials was erected, to show what the church would look like. It was not completed until 1790, at the time of the French Revolution of 1789, when it became the Panth√©on. In 1748, the Academy of Arts commissioned a monumental statue of the king on horseback by the sculptor Bouchardon, and the Academy of Architecture was assigned to create a square, to be called Place Louis XV, where it could be erected. The site selected was the marshy open space between the Seine, the moat and bridge to the Tuileries garden, and the Champs-√âlys√©es, which led to the √âtoile, convergence of hunting trails on the western edge of the city (now Place Charles de Gaulle-√âtoile). The winning plans for the square and buildings next to it were drawn by the architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel. Gabriel designed two large mansions with a street between them, Rue Royale, designed to give a clear view of the statue in the center of the square. Construction began in 1754, and the statue was put in place and dedicated on 23 February 1763. The two large mansions were still unfinished, but the fa√ßades were finished in 1765-66. The Fontaine des Quatre- Saisons (1774) was monumental, but originally had only two small water spouts for filling containers The other monumental major building projects of Louis XV were all on the Left Bank: a new mint, the H√¥tel des Monnaies, with a 117-meter fa√ßade along the Seine (1767‚Äì1775); a new medical school, the √âcole de Chirurgie, designed by Jacques Gondouin (1771‚Äì1775), and a new theater for the Com√©die Fran√ßaise, called the Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on, designed by the architects Charles de Wailly and Marie-Joseph Peyre, which was begun in 1770, but not finished until 1774. In addition to classical buildings, Louis XV constructed a monumental fountain, the Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons, richly decorated with classical sculpture by the Bouchardon glorifying the King, at 57-59 rue de la Grenelle. While the fountain was huge, and dominated the narrow street, it originally had only two small spouts, from which residents of the neighborhood could fill their water containers. It was criticized by Voltaire in a letter to the Count de Caylus in 1739, as the fountain was still under construction: The Parisians There was no official census of the Parisians before 1801, but based on parish records and other sources, most historians estimate that the population of Paris was about 500,000 persons at the beginning of the 18th century and grew to between 600,000 and 650,000 shortly before the Revolution of 1789. Following the Reign of Terror, economic hardship and the emigration of the nobility, the 1801 census reported that the population had dropped to 546,856, but it quickly recovered to reach 622,636 in 1811. It was no longer the largest city in Europe; London passed it in population in about 1700, but it was by far the largest city in France, and throughout the 18th century grew at a rapid rate, largely by an immigration from the Paris basin and from the north and east of France. The center of the city became more and more crowded; building lots became smaller and buildings taller, to four, five and even six stories. In 1784, the height of buildings was finally limited to nine toises, or about eighteen meters.Sarmant, Thierry, Histoire de Paris, pp. 129-131 =The nobles= The Hotel de Brunoy, the town house of the Duke de Brunoy on the rue de Faubourg Saint-Honor√©, seen from the Champs-√âlys√©es (1779) Until the 1789 Revolution, Paris had a strict social hierarchy, whose customs and rules were established by long tradition. It was described by Louis-S√©bastien Mercier in the Le Tableau de Paris, written in 1783: \\"There are in Paris eight distinct classes; the princes and great nobles (these are the least numerous); the Nobles of the Robe; the financiers; the traders and merchants; the artists; the craftsmen; the manual workers; the servants; and the bas peuple (lower class).\\" The nobility, including the upper levels of the clergy, who were closely connected with them by family ties, numbered only about three or four percent of the population; their number was estimated by modern historians at about twenty thousand men, women and children. At the very top of the nobility were the Dukes and Pairs, numbering about forty families, including that of the duc d'Orl√©ans, who spent two million livres a year, and owned the Palais-Royal. Below them were about a hundred families with incomes between 10,000 and 50,000 livres a year, including many high-ranking military men, magistrates, and financiers. The old nobility received their income from their estates, while newer nobles depended upon payments they received from the royal government in Versailles for various government positions and titles they held. The nobility had greatly expanded under Louis XIV, who liberally awarded or sold titles to men who had served the royal government. By 1726, two-thirds of the members of the Estates-General, who largely lived in Paris, had acquired or were in the process of acquiring noble status. The playwright Beaumarchais, the son of a watchmaker, was able to buy a title. Wealthy merchants and financiers were often able to obtain noble status for their families by marrying daughters to members of the old nobility. Nobles who went into military service automatically received high ranks because of their status; they entered the service at the age of fifteen or sixteen, and, if they were well connected, could expect to command a regiment by the time they were only twenty-five. The children of the nobility attended the most select schools in Paris; the Coll√®ge de Clermont, and especially the Jesuit college of Louis-le-Grand. In addition to their academic courses, they were taught fencing and horsemanship. At the beginning of the 18th century, most of the noble families had their large h√¥tels particuliers, or town houses, in the Marais neighborhood, but over the course of the century they moved to the neighborhoods of the Faubourg Saint-Honor√©, near the Palais Royal, and especially to the left bank, to the new Faubourg Saint-Germain or north-west to the Luxembourg Palace. By 1750, only about ten percent of noble families still resided in the Marais. By 1763, the Faubourg Saint-Germain had replaced the Marais as the most fashionable residential neighborhood for the aristocracy and the wealthy, but the Marais never completely lost all of its nobility, and always remained fashionable until the French Revolution in 1789. They built magnificent private residences there, in the Faubourg, many of which later became government residences or institutions; the H√¥tel d'√âvreux (1718‚Äì1720) later became the √âlys√©e Palace, the residence of the Presidents of the Republic; the H√¥tel Matignon became the residence of the Prime Minister; the Palais Bourbon became the home of the National Assembly; the H√¥tel Salm became the Palais de la L√©gion d'Honneur, and the H√¥tel de Biron eventually became the Rodin Museum.Sarmant, Thierry, Histoire de Paris, pp. 122-123 =The wealthy and the middle class= The bourgeois, or members of the middle class of Paris, financiers, merchants, shopkeepers, artisans, and those in the liberal professions (doctors, lawyers, accountants, teachers, government officials) were a growing social class. They were specifically defined by law as persons who had lived in the city at least a year in their own residence, and earned enough money to pay taxes. In 1780, there were an estimated 25,000 Paris households who fell into this category, about fourteen percent of the total. Many of those in the upper middle class rose from modest social origins to amass very large fortunes. Many of the wealthiest bourgeois built their own palatial town houses in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in the Montmartre quarter, the banking center of the city, or close to the Palais Royal. The upper middle class, once they had made their fortunes, frequently lived by buying the debts and collecting rentes from the nobility and the government, which during the 18th century were both always short of cash. While the nobles tended to dress in rich and elaborate costumes and bright colors, the bourgeois wore rich fabrics but dark and sober colors. The bourgeois played a very active role in each neighborhood; they were the leaders of the religious confr√©ries which organized charitable and religious activities for each profession, managed the finances of the parish churches, and ran the corporations which governed each profession in Paris. Some professions were able to advance up the professional and social scale. At the beginning of the 18th century, doctors were members of the same professional corporation as barbers, and required no special training. In 1731, they established the first Society of Surgeons, and in 1743, a university medical degree was required to practice surgery. In 1748, the Society of Surgeons became the Academy of Surgery. The lawyers followed the same path; at the beginning of the 18th century, the University of Paris taught only church law. In the 1730s, the lawyers formed their own association and began to provide formal professional training in civil law. Forty-three percent of Parisian property owners were merchants or belonged to the liberal professions; thirty percent were shopkeepers and master artisans, who usually had had one or two employees and one servant, and lived above or behind their shop or workshop. The skilled workers and craftsmen of Paris had been divided for centuries into m√©tiers or professions. In 1776, there were 125 recognized m√©tiers, ranging from barbers, apothecaries, bakers and cooks to sculptors, barrel-makers, lace-makers and musicians. Each m√©tier or profession had its own corporation, rules, customs, and patron saint. The corporation set prices, controlled entry into the profession, and provided charitable services, including paying for the funeral, of members. In 1776, the government tried to reform the system, and consolidated the m√©tiers into six corporations: the drapiers, or cloth- dealers; bonnetiers, who made and sold hats; √©piciers, who sold food products; merciers, who sold clothing; pelletiers, or fur merchants, and orf√®vres, who included silversmiths, goldsmiths, and jewelers. =Workers, servants and the poor= a woman selling firewood (1737) Most Parisians belonged to the working class or the poor. There were some forty thousand domestic servants, mostly working for middle-class families. Most came from the provinces; only five percent were born in Paris. They lived with the families they served, and their living and working conditions depended entirely on character of their employers. They received very low wages, worked long hours, and if they lost their job, or if a woman became pregnant, they had little hope of getting another position. A large portion of the working poor, especially women and including many children, worked at home, sewing, embroidering, making lace, dolls, toys and other products for small shops. An unskilled male worker earned about twenty to thirty sous a day (there were twenty sous in a livre); a woman earned about half as much. A skilled mason could earn fifty sous. A four-pound loaf of bread cost eight or nine sous. A family with two children, where both parents worked, consumed two four-pound loaves a day. Because there were between 110 and 150 holidays, Sundays and other non-working days, families often spent half their income on bread alone. In 1700, the minimum rent for an attic room was thirty to forty livres a year; rent for two rooms was a minimum of sixty livres. The indigent, those who were unable to support themselves, were numerous, and largely depended upon religious charity or public assistance to survive. They included the elderly, widows with children, the sick, the handicapped and the injured. In 1743, the curate of Saint-M√©dard in the poor Faubourg Saint-Marcel reported that of the 15,000 to 18,000 people in his parish, some 12,000 needed assistance to survive, even during good economic periods. In 1708, in the wealthier Saint-Sulpice parish), there were 13,000 to 14,000 poor who received assistance. One historian, Daniel Roche, estimated that in 1700 there were between 150,000 and 200,000 indigent persons in Paris, or about a third of the population. The number grew in times of economic hardship. This included only those who were officially recognized and assisted by the churches and the city. The working class Parisians and the poor were concentrated in the crowded maze of streets in the center of the city, on the √éle de la Cit√© or close to the central market at Les Halles, and in the eastern neighborhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine (One of the reasons the nobility slowly moved to the Faubourg Saint-Germain), where thousands of small workshops and the furniture business were located, or on the Left Bank, near the Bi√®vre River, where the tanners and dyers were located. In the years just before the Revolution, these neighborhoods were flooded with thousands unskilled immigrants from the poorer regions of France. In 1789, these unemployed and hungry workers became the foot soldiers of the Revolution.

The first venture of Paris into modern finance was launched by the Scottish economist John Law, who, encouraged by the Regent, in 1716 started a private bank and issued paper money. Law invested heavily in the Mississippi Company, causing wild speculation, with shares rising to sixty times their original value. The bubble burst in 1720, and Law closed the bank and fled the country, ruining many Parisian investors. Thereafter, Parisians were suspicious of banks and bankers. The Bourse, or Paris stock market, did not open until 24 September 1724 on rue Vivienne, in the former h√¥tel de Nevers, long after stock markets had existed in Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, Toulouse and other cities. The Banque de France was not founded until 1800, long after the Bank of Amsterdam (1609), and the Bank of England (1694). Throughout the 18th century, the government was unable to pay its mounting debts. As Saint-Simon wrote, the taxpayers of France were obliged to pay for \\"a war badly begun and badly supported, the greed of a prime minister, of a favorite, of a mistress, of foolish expenditures, and the prodigality of a King, which soon exhausted a bank and‚Ä¶ undermined the Kingdom.\\". The ruined finances of the kingdom, and the dismissal by Louis XVI of his finance minister, the Swiss-born Jacques Necker, led Paris directly into the French Revolution in 1789. =Luxury Goods= A vase from the S√®vres Porcelain Manufactory (about 1770) in the Walters Art Museum During the 18th century, French royal workshops produced jewelry, snuff boxes, watches, porcelain, carpets, silverware, mirrors, tapestries, furniture and other luxury goods not only for the French Court, but also for the Empresses of Russia, the Emperor of Austria, and the other courts of Europe. Louis XV oversaw royal manufacturers of tapestries (Gobelins and Beauvais), of carpets (Savonnerie manufactory), and established a royal workshop to make fine dishes at the Manufacture nationale de S√®vres between 1753 ann 1757. In 1759, the S√®vres manufactory became his personal property; the first French-made porcelain was presented to him on 21 December 1769. He gave complete services as gifts to the King of Denmark and the Queen of Naples, and established the first annual exhibition of porcelain at Versailles beginning in 1769. The chair-makers, upholsterers. wood carvers, and foundries of Paris were kept busy making luxury furnishings, statues, gates, door knobs, ceilings, and architectural ornament for the royal palaces and for the new town houses of the nobility in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. =High Fashion= The Modiste, by Fran√ßois Boucher (1746) Fashion and haute couture was a flourishing business in the mid and late 18th century, as the aristocrats copied the styles of clothing worn by the Queen and her court, and the wives of Paris bankers and wealthy merchants copied the styles worn by the aristocrats. The fashion industry was formally born in 1776, when the guild of fashion merchants (marchandes de modes), along with plume merchants and florists, was officially separated from the mercers, those who sold ordinary clothing. By 1779, two hundred different models of hats were being sold in Paris, at prices ranging from ten to one hundred pounds, along with every other possible fashion item. Marie Antoinette wears an elaborate pouf designed by her hair stylist, L√©onard Auti√© (1775) The most prominent name in fashion was Rose Bertin, who made dresses for Marie Antoinette; in 1773 she opened a shop called the Grand Mogol on the Faubourg rue Saint-Honor√© that catered to the wealthiest and most fashion-conscious Parisians. The dressmaker's shops in the galleries of the Palais Royal were another important place for seeing and having copies made of the latest dresses, hats, shoes, shawls, ribbons and other accessories. A specialized press developed to provide illustrations of the new fashions to the wealthy consumers of the European capitals. The first Paris fashion journal Le Journal des Dames appeared in 1774, followed by the Galerie des modes et du costume fran√ßaise in 1778.Dictionnaire historique de Paris, (2013), Le Livre de Poche, , pages 468-469 The shop of Rose Bertin went out of business with the Revolution and the disappearance of her clients. but she continued to supply ribbons and other modest items to Marie-Antoinette during her imprisonment in the Temple until her execution. The Paris perfume industry also emerged in its modern form in the second part the 18th century, after the guild of perfumers separated from the guild of glove-makers. The perfumes were usually made in Grasse, in Provence, but the shops that sold them were opened in Paris. In 1798, the perfumer of the Queen, Pierre-Fran√ßois Lubin, opened a perfume shop at 53 rue Helv√©tius (now rue Sainte-Anne), with the name au Bouquet de Roses. Other perfumers opened similar shops catering to wealthy Parisians and visitors. Wig-makers and hair stylists also made their fortunes from wealthy and aristocratic Parisian clients. Powdered wigs for men continued to be the fashion, even during the Revolution; the architect of the Reign of Terror, Robespierre, wore a powdered wig until his own execution. The hair stylist of Marie-Antoinette, L√©onard Auti√©, known simply as Monsieur Leonard, created extravagant poufs and other towering hair styles that were eagerly imitated by the court and the wealthiest Parisiennes. Throughout the century, fashion was a sign of the social class of the person wearing the clothes. Aristocrats, men and women, wore the most expensive, colorful and elaborate fabrics; bankers and merchants wore more sober colors, usually dark brown, green or blue, to show their seriousness, though their wives dressed as richly as aristocrats. Men wore culottes, a type of tight short trouser attached below the knee to silk stockings. The Revolutionaries and poor mocked the rich by calling themselves the sans-culottes, those without culottes. With the Revolution and the disappearance of the aristocrats, men's clothing became less colorful and more sober, and women's clothing began to imitate the popular view of the clothing of ancient Rome and Greece, in keeping with the revolutionary ideals of the new French Republic.

The workshops were clustered in particular neighborhoods; furniture makers in the faubourg Saint-Antoine; cutlery and small metal-work in neighborhood called the Quinze Vingts near the Bastille. There were a few large enterprises, including the dye factory of Gobelins, next to the Bi√®vre river, which made scarlet dye for the Gobelin royal tapestry workshop, the oldest factory in the city, founded at the end of the 17th century; the royal manufactory of S√®vres, making porcelain; the royal mirror factory in the faubourg Saint-Antoine, which employed a thousand workers; and the factory of R√©veillon on rue de Montreuil, which made painted wallpaper. There were a handful of pioneering large-scale enterprises at the edge of the city; the Antony candle factory and a large factory making printed cotton fabrics, directed by the German-born Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf at Jouy-en-Josas, ten miles from the center of the city. Opened in 1762, this plant was one of the most modern factories in Europe; at its peak in 1774, it employed two thousand workers and produced sixty four thousand pieces of fabric. In the second half of the 18th century, new scientific discoveries and new technologies changed the scale of Paris industry. Between 1778 and 1782, large steam engines were installed at Chaillot and Gros-Caillou to pump drinking water from the Seine. Major changes took place between 1770 and 1790 in chemical manufacturing, due to the pioneering work of French chemists. The first chemical factories were built between 1770 and 1779, based on the work of Lavoisier, an innovative chemist who was head of the laboratory of the Paris Arsenal and was also the head of the royal administration for making gunpowder. He modernized the production of saltpeter, the main ingredient of black powder, in large factories around Paris. The French chemist Berthollet discovered chlorine in 1785, creating a new industry for the manufacture of potassium chloride. New discoveries about acids, used extensively in fabric dyeing and metallurgy, led to the creation of new industries in Paris; the first French plant to manufacture sulfuric acid was opened in 1779. It was owned by the brother of king Louis XVI, the Count of Artois; the King himself promoted it, eager that France complete successfully with England in industrial manufacturing. The chemical factory at Javel branched out to make other chemical products, including chlorine and hydrogen gas; the hydrogen made possible the first manned balloon flights by the Montgolfier Brothers shortly before the Revolution. Institutions =The city administration= The H√¥tel de Ville in 1753 From the beginning of the 18th century until the Revolution, Paris was governed by a multitude of royal Lieutenants, provosts and other officers whose positions had been created over the centuries, many of which were purely ceremonial, and none of whom had complete power over the city. The provost of the merchants, once a powerful position, had become purely ceremonial, and was named by the King. The corporations of the different professions had formerly governed Paris commerce; but after 1563, they were replaced by a system of royal commercial judges, the future commercial tribunals. The oldest and last Paris corporation, that of the river merchants, lost its rights and powers in 1672. Beginning in 1681, all the senior officials of the city, including the Provost of Paris and Governor of Paris, were nobles named by the King. The Provost and Echevins of Paris had prestige; formal costumes, carriages, banquets and official portraits, but little if any power. The position of Lieutenant General of Police, who served under the King and had his office at the fortress of Ch√¢telet, was created in 1647. He did have some real authority; he was in charge of maintaining public order, and was also in charge of controlling weights and measures, and cleaning and lighting the streets. With the Revolution, the city administration suddenly found itself without a royal master. On 15 July 1789, immediately after the fall of the Bastille, the astronomer Bailly was proclaimed the first modern mayor of Paris. The old city government was abolished on 15 August, and a new municipal assembly created, with three hundred members, five from each of sixty Paris districts. On 21 May 1790, the National Assembly reorganized the city government, replacing the sixty districts with forty-eight sections. each governed by sixteen commissaires and a comissiaire of police. Each section had its own committees responsible for charity, armament, and surveillance of the citizens. The Mayor was elected for two years, and was supported by sixteen administrators overseeing five departments, including the police, finances, public works, public establishments, public works, and food supplies. The Municipal Council had thirty-two elected members. Above this was the Council General of the Commune, composed the mayor, the Municipal Council, the city administrators, and ninety six notables, which met only to discuss the most important issues. This system was too complex and meetings were regularly disrupted by the representatives of the more radical sections. On August 10, 1792, on the same day that the members of the more radical political clubs and the sans-culottes stormed the Tuileries Palace, they also took over the Hotel de Ville, expelling the elected government and an Insurrectionary Commune. New elections by secret ballot gave the insurrectionary Commune only a minority of the Council. The more radical revolutionaries succeeded in invalidating the elections of their rivals, and took complete control of Commune. Robespierre, leading the Convention and its Committee on Public Safety, distrusted the new Commune and placed it under strict surveillance. On 17 September 1793, Robespierre put the city government under the authority of the Convention and the Committee of Public Safety. In March 1794, Robespierre had his opponents in the city government arrested and sent to the guillotine, and replaced by his own supporters. When the Convention finally turned upon Robespierre on 28 July 1794, he took sanctuary with his supporters in the City Hall, but was arrested and guillotined the same day. The new government, the Directory, had no desire to see another rival government appear in the H√¥tel-de-Ville. On 11 October 1795, the Directory changed the status of Paris from an independent department to a canton of the Department of the Seine. The post of mayor was abolished, and the city was henceforth governed by the five administrators of the Department of the Seine. The city was divided into twelve municipalities subordinate to the government of the Department. Each municipality was governed by seven administrators named by the heads of the Department. Paris did not have its own elected mayor again until 1977. =The police= The policemen of the Guet, in blue uniforms, transport a cartload of prostitutes to the hospital-prison of Salp√™tri√®re (1745) At the beginning of the 18th century, security was provided by two different corps of police; the Garde de Paris and the Guet Royal, or royal watchmen. Both organizations were under the command of the Lieutenant General of Police. The Garde had one hundred twenty horsemen and four hundred archers, and was more of a military unit. The Guet was composed of 4 lieutenants, 139 archers, including 39 on horseback, and four drummers. The sergeants of the Guet wore a blue justaucorps or tight- fitting jacket with silver lace, a white plume on their hat, and red stockings, while ordinary soldiers of the guard wore a gray jacket with brass buttons and red facing on their sleeve, a white plume on their hat and a bandolier. 1750 there were nineteen posts of the Guet around the city, each the manned by twelve guards. The members of the Guet were part of the local neighborhood, and were almost all Parisians; they were known for taking bribes and buying their commissions. The members of the Garde were mostly former army soldiers from the provinces, with little attachment to Paris. They were headquartered in the quarter Saint-Martin, and were more efficient and reliable supporters of the royal government, responsible for putting down riots in 1709 and 1725. In 1771, the Guet was formally placed under the command of the Garde, and was gradually integrated into its organization. The responsibilities of the Garde were far-ranging, from chasing criminals to monitoring bread prices, keeping traffic moving on the streets, settling disputes and maintaining public order. The Parisians considered the police both corrupt and inefficient, and relations between the people and the police were increasingly strained. When the Revolution began, the Garde harshly repressed the first riots of 1788-89, but, submerged in the neighborhoods of Paris, it was quickly infected by revolutionary ideas. On 13 October 1789, the Garde was formally attached to the Garde Nationale. It was reformed into the Legion de Police Parisienne on 27 June 1795, but its members mutinied on 28 April 1796, when it was proposed that they become part of the Army. The Garde was finally abolished on 2 May 1796. Paris did not have its own police force again until 4 October 1802, when Napoleon created the Garde Municipale de Paris, under military command. =The hospitals= For most of the 18th century, the hospitals were religious institutions, run by the church, which provided more spiritual than actual medical care. The largest and oldest was the H√¥tel-Dieu, located on the parvis of Notre-Dame Cathedral on the opposite side of the square from its present location. It was founded in 651 by Saint Landry of Paris. Its original buildings were entirely destroyed in the course of three fires in the 18th century, in 1718, 1737 and 1772. It was staffed by members of religious orders, and welcomed the destitute as well as the sick. Despite having two, three or even four patients per bed, it was always overflowing with the sick and poor of the city. The city had many smaller hospitals run by religious orders, some dating to Middle Ages; and there were also many specialized hospitals; for former soldiers at Les Invalides; for the contagious at La Sanitat de Saint-Marcel, or La Sant√©; a hospital for abandoned children, called Les Enfants Trouv√©s; a hospital for persons with sexually transmitted diseases, in a former convent on boulevard Port Royal, founded in 1784; and a hospital for orphans founded by the wealthy industrialist Beaujon, opened in 1785 on the Faubourg Saint-Honor√©. Some hospitals served as prisons, where beggars were confined; these included the hospital of La Piti√©, and La Salp√™trie, an enormous prison-hospital reserved for women, particularly prostitutes. In 1793, during the course of the Revolution, the royal convent of Val-de-Gr√¢ce was closed and was turned into a military hospital, and in 1795, the abbey of Saint-Antoine, in the Saint- Antoine quarter, was also converted into a hospital. Women giving birth at Hotel-Dieu and other hospitals were almost always poor and often wanted to hide their pregnancy; they were literally confined, unable to leave, and were not allowed to have visitors. They wore bed clothes with blue markings so they could be spotted if they tried to leave without authorization. They slept in large beds for four persons each. In 1795, the first maternity hospital in Paris was opened at Port-Royal, which eventually also included a school for training midwives. As the practice of vaccination was introduced and showed its effectiveness, patients began to have more confidence in medical healing. In 1781, the responsibility for medical care was formally transferred from church authority to the medical profession; patients were no longer admitted to the H√¥tel-Dieu except for medical treatment, and doctors insisted that the medical treatment be scientific, not just spiritual. As medical schools became more connected to hospitals, the bodies of patients were seen as objects of medical observation used to study and teach pathological anatomy, rather than just bodies in need of hospital care. =Prisons and the debut of the guillotine= The Bastille in 1715 Paris possessed an extraordinary number and variety of prisons, used for different classes of persons and types of crimes. The fortress of the Ch√¢telet was the oldest royal prison, where the office of the Provost of Paris was also located. It had about fifteen large cells; the better cells were on the upper levels, where prisoners could pay a high pension to be comfortable and well-fed, while the lower cells, called de la Fosse, de la Gourdaine, du Puits and de l'Oubliette, were extremely damp and barely lit by the sun coming through a grate at street level. The Bastille and the Ch√¢teau de Vincennes were both used for high-ranking political prisoners, and had relatively luxurious conditions. The last three prisoners at the Chateau de Vincennes, the Marquis de Sade and two elderly and insane noblemen, were transferred to the Bastillle in 1784. The Bastille, begun in 1370, never held more than forty inmates; At the time of the Revolution, the Bastille had just seven prisoners; four counterfeiters, the two elderly noblemen, and a man named Tavernier, half-mad, accused of participation in an attempt to kill Louis XV thirty years earlier. Priests and other religious figures who committed crimes or other offenses were tried by church courts, and each priory and abbey had its own small prison. That of the Abbey of Saint-Germain- des-Pres was located at 166 boulevard Saint-Germain, and was a square building fifteen meters in diameter, with floors of small cells as deep as ten meters underground. The Abbey prison became a military prison under Louis XIV; in September 1792, it was the scene of a terrible massacre of prisoners, the prelude to the Reign of Terror. Two large prisons which also served as hospitals had been established under Louis XIV largely to hold the growing numbers of beggars and the indigent; La Salp√™tri√®re, which held two to three hundred condemned women, largely prostitutes; and Bic√™tre, which held five prisoners at the time of the Revolution. Conditions within were notoriously harsh, and there were several mutinies by prisoners there in the 18th century. La Salp√™tri√®re was closed in 1794, and the prisoners moved to a new prison of Saint-Lazare. The tower of the Temple, where the royal family were held prisoner, in 1795 For-l'Ev√™que on the quai M√©gesserie, built in 1222, held prisoners guilty of more serious crimes; it was only 35 meters by nine meters in size, built for two hundred prisoners, but by the time of the Revolution it held as many as five hundred prisoners. It was finally demolished in 1783, and replaced by a new prison, created in 1780 by the transformation of the large town house of the family of La Force on rue de Roi-de-Sicilie, which became known as Grande Force. A smaller prison, called la Petite Force, was opened in 1785 nearby at 22 rue Pav√©e. A separate prison was created for those prisoners who had been sentenced to the galleys; they were held in the ch√¢teau de la Tournelle at 1 quai de la Tournelle; twice a year these prisoners were transported out of Paris to the ports to serve their sentences on the galleys. In addition to the royal and ecclesiastical prisons, there were also a number of privately owned prisons, some for those who were unable to pay debts, and some, called masons de correction, for parents who wanted to discipline their children; the young future revolutionary Louis Antoine de Saint-Just was imprisoned by his mother in one of these for running away and stealing the family silverware. During the Reign of Terror of 1793 and 1794, all the prisons were filled, and additional space was needed to hold accused aristocrats and counter-revolutionaries. The King and his family were imprisoned within the tower of the Temple. The Luxembourg Palace and the former convents of Les Carmes (70 rue Vaugirard) and Port-Royal (121-125 boulevard Port-Royal) were turned into prisons. The Conciergerie within the Palace of Justice was used to hold accused criminals during their trial; Marie-Antoinette was held there until her sentence and execution. In the first half of the 18th century, under the Old Regime, criminals could be executed either by hanging, decapitation, burning alive, boiling alive, being broken on a wheel, or by drawing and quartering. The domestic servant Robert-Fran√ßois Damiens, who tried to kill King Louis XV, was executed in 1757 by drawing and quartering, the traditional punishment for regicide. His punishment lasted an hour before he died. the last man in France to suffer that penalty. Among the last persons to be hung in Paris was the Marquis de Favras, who was hung on the Place de Greve for attempting help Louis XVI in his unsuccessful flight from Paris. The execution by the guillotine of Marie Antoinette on 16 October 1793 In October 1789 Doctor Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, in the interest of finding a more humane method, successfully had the means of execution changed to decapitation by a machine he perfected, the guillotine, built with the help of a Paris manufacturer of pianos and harps named Tobias Schmidt and the surgeon Antoine Louis. The first person to be executed with the guillotine was the thief Nicholas Jacques Pelletier, on 25 April 1792. After the uprising of the sans-culottes and the fall of the monarchy on August 10, 1792, the guillotine was turned against alleged counter-revolutionaries; the first to be executed by the guillotine was Collenot d'Angremont, accused of defending the Tuileries Palace against the attack of the sans-culottes; he was executed on 21 August 1792 on the place du Carousel, next to the Tuileries Palace. The King was executed on the Place de la Concorde, renamed the Place de la Revolution, on 21 January 1793. From that date until 7 June 1794, 1,221 persons, or about three a day, were guillotined on the Place de la Revolution, including Queen Marie-Antoinette on 16 October 1793. In 1794, for reasons of hygiene, the Convention had the guillotine moved to the place Saint-Antoine, now the rue de la Bastille, near the site of the old fortress; seventy-three heads were cut off in just three days. In June 1793, again for reasons of avoiding epidemics, it was moved to the Place du Tron-Renvers√© (the Place of the Overturned Throne, now Place de la Nation). There, at the height of the Reign of Terror, between 11 June and 27 July, 1,376 persons were beheaded, or about thirty a day. After the execution of Robespierre himself, the reign of terror came to an end. The guillotine was moved to the Place de Gr√®ve, and was used only for the execution of common criminals. =The University and Grandes √©coles= The University of Paris had fallen gradually in quality and influence since the 17th century. It was primarily a school of theology, not well adapted to the modern world, and played no important role in the scientific revolution or the Enlightenment. The school of law taught only religious law, and the medical school had little prestige, since doctors, until the mid-18th century, were considered in the same professional category as barbers. The university shrank from about sixty colleges in the early 17th century to thirty-nine in 1700. In 1763, the twenty-nine smallest colleges were grouped together in the college Louis-le-Grand, but altogether it had only 193 students. On 5 April 1792, without any loud protest, the University was closed. Following its closing, the chapel of the Sorbonne was stripped for its furnishings and the head of its founder, Cardinal Richelieu, was cut out of the famous portrait by Philippe de Champaigne. The building of the College de Cluny on Place Sorbonne was sold; the College de Sens became a boarding house, the College Lemoine was advertised as suitable for shops; the College d'Harcourt was half-demolished and the other half turned into workshops for tanners and locksmiths, and the College Saint-Barbe became a workshop for mechanical engineers. The University was not re-established until 1808, under Napoleon, with the name Universit√© imperial. While the University vanished, new military science and engineering teaching schools flourished during the Revolution, as the revolutionary government sought to create a highly centralized and secular education system, centered in Paris. Some of the schools had been founded before the Revolution; the School of bridges and highways, France's first engineering school, was founded in 1747. The √âcole Militaire was founded in 1750 to give an academic education to the sons of poor nobles; its most famous graduate was Napoleon Bonaparte in 1785; he completed the two-year course in just one year. The Ecole Polytechnique was founded in 1794, and became a military academy under Napoleon in 1804. The √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure was founded in 1794 to train teachers; it had some of France's best scientists on its faculty. These so-called Grandes √©coles trained engineers and teachers who launched the French industrial revolution in the 19th century. =Religions and the Freemasons= The great majority of Parisians were at least nominally Roman Catholic, and the church played an enormous role in the life of the city; though its influence declined toward the end of the century, partly because of the Enlightenment, and partly from conflicts within the church establishment. The church, along with the nobility, suffered more than any other institutions from the French Revolution. For most of the 18th century, until the Revolution, the church ran the hospitals and provided the health care in the city; was responsible for aiding the poor, and ran all the educational establishments, from the parish schools through the University of Paris. The nobility and the higher levels of the church were closely linked; the archbishops, bishops and other high figures of the church came from noble families, promoted their relatives, lived with ostentatious luxury, did not always live highly moral lives. Talleyrand, though a bishop, never bothered to hide his mistress, and was much more involved in politics than religious affairs. At the beginning of the century the Confreries, corporations of the members of each of the different Paris professions, were very active in each parish at the beginning of the century, organizing, events and managing the finances of the local churches, but their importance declined over the century, as the nobility, rather than the merchants, took over management of the church. The church in Paris also suffered from internal tensions. In the 17th century, as part of the Counter- Reformation, forty-eight religious orders, including the Dominicans, Franciscans, Jacobins, Capucines, Jesuits and many others, had established monasteries and convents in Paris. These establishments reported to the Pope in Rome rather than to the Archbishop of Paris, which soon caused trouble. The leaders of the Sorbonne chose to support the leadership of the archbishop rather than the Pope, so the Jesuits established their own college, Clermont, within the University of Paris, and constructed their own church, Saint-Louis, on the rue Saint-Antoine. The conflicts continued; The Jesuits refused to grant absolution to Madame de Pompadour, mistress of the King, because she was not married to him, 1763 and 1764 the King closed the Jesuit colleges and expelled the order from the city. The unfinished south tower of the church of Saint-Sulpice, left as it was in 1789. The Enlightenment also caused growing difficulties, as Voltaire and other Philosophes argued against unquestioned acceptance of the doctrines of the church. Paris became a battleground between the established church and the largely upper-class followers of a sect called Jansenism, founded in Paris in 1623, and fiercely persecuted by both Louis XIV and the Pope. The archbishop of Paris required that dying persons sign a document renouncing Jansenism; if they refused to sign, they were denied last rites from the church. There were rebellions over smaller matters as well; in 1765 twenty-eight Benedictine monks petitioned the King to postpone the hour of first prayers so they could sleep longer, and to have the right to wear more attractive robes. The church in Paris also had great difficulty recruiting new priests among the Parisians; of 870 priests ordained in Paris between 1778 and 1789, only one-third were born in the city. The Catholic diocese of Paris also was having financial problems late in the century. It was unable to pay for the completion of the south tower of the church of Saint-Sulpice. though the north tower was rebuilt between 1770 and 1780; the unfinished tower is still as it was in 1789. unable to finish it to complete the churches of Saint-Barth√©lemy and Saint-Sauveur. Four old churches, falling into ruins, were torn down and not replaced because of lack of funds. After the fall of the Bastille, the new National Assembly argued that the belongings of the church belonged to the nation, and ordered that church property be sold to pay the debts incurred by the monarchy. Convents and monasteries were ordered closed, and their buildings and furnishings sold as national property. Priests were no longer permitted to take vows; instead, they were required to take an oath of fidelity to the nation. Twenty-five of fifty Paris curates agreed to take the oath, along with thirty-three of sixty-nine vicars, a higher proportion than in other parts of France. Conflicts broke out in front of churches, where many parishioners refused to accept the priests who had taken the oath to the government. As the war began against Austria and Prussia, the government hardened its line against the priests who refused to take the oath. They were suspected of being spies, and a law was passed on 27 May 1792 calling for their deportation. large numbers of these priests were arrested and imprisoned; in September 1792 more than two hundred priests were taken from the jails and massacred. During the Reign of Terror, the anti- religious campaign intensified. All priests, including those who had signed the oath, were ordered to sign a declaration giving up the priesthood. One third of the four hundred priests remaining renounced their profession. On 23 November 1793, all the churches in Paris were closed, or transformed into \\"temples of reason\\". Civil divorce was made simple, and 1,663 divorces were granted in the first nine months of 1793, along with 5,004 civil marriages. A new law on 6 December 1793 permitted religious services in private, but in practice the local revolutionary government arrested or dispersed anyone who tried to celebrate mass in a home. After the execution of Robespierre, the remaining clerics in prison were nearly all released, but the Convention and Directory continued to be hostile to the church. On 18 September 1794, they declared that the state recognized no religion, and therefore cancelled salaries they had been paying to the priests who had taken an oath of loyalty to the government.and outlawed the practice of allowing government-owned buildings for worship. On 21 February, the Directory recognized the liberty of worship, but outlawed any religious symbols on the exterior of buildings, prohibited wearing religious garb in public, and prohibited the use of government-owned buildings, including churches, for worship. On May 30, 1795, the rules were softened slightly and the church was allowed the use of twelve churches, one per arrondissement; the churches opened included the Cathedral of Notre Dame, Saint-Roche, Saint-Sulpice and Saint-Eustache. The number of recognized priests who had taken the oath the government fell from six hundred in 1791 to one hundred fifty in 1796, to seventy-five in 1800, In addition, there were about three hundred priests who had not taken the oath secretly conducting religious services. The Catholic Church was required to share the use of Notre-Dame, Saint-Sulpice and Saint-Roche with two new secular religions based on reason that had been created in the spirit of the Revolution; The church of Theophilanthropy and the Church of the Decadaire, the latter named for the ten-month revolutionary calendar. The Protestant Church had been strictly controlled and limited by the royal government for most of the 18th century. Only one church building was allowed, at Charenton, far from the center of the city, six kilometers from the Bastille. There were an estimated 8,500 Protestants in Paris in 1680, both Calvinists and Lutherans, or about two percent of the population. At Charenton, an act of religious tolerance was adopted by the royal government in November 1787, but it was opposed by the Catholic Church and the Parlement of Paris, and never put into effect. After the Revolution, the new mayor, Bailly, authorized Protestants to use the church of Saint-Louis-Saint-Thomas, next to the Louvre. The Jewish community in Paris was also very small; an estimated five hundred persons in 1789. About fifty were Sephardic Jews who had originally come from Spain and Portugal, then lived in Bayonne before coming to Paris. They lived mostly in the neighborhood of Saint-German-des-Pr√©s, and worked largely in the silk and chocolate-making businesses. There was another Sephardic community of about one hundred persons in the same neighborhood, who were originally from Avignon, from the oldest Jewish community in France, which had lived protected in the Papal state. They mostly worked in commerce. The third and largest community, about three hundred fifty persons, were Ashkenazi Jews from Alsace, Lorraine, Germany, the Netherlands and Poland. They spoke Yiddish, and lived largely in the neighborhood of the Church of Saint-Merri. They included three bankers, several silk merchants and jewelers, second-hand clothing dealers, and a large number of persons in the hardware business. They were granted citizenship after the French Revolution on 27 April 1791, but their religious institutions were not recognized by the French State until 1808. The Freemasons were not a religious community, but functioned like one and had a powerful impact on events in Paris in the 18th century. The first lodge in France, the Grand Loge de France, was founded on 24 June 1738 on the rue des Boucheries, and was led by the Duke of Antin. By 1743, there were sixteen lodges in Paris, and their grand master was the Count of Clermont, close to the royal family. The lodges contained aristocrats, the wealthy, church leaders and scientists. Their doctrines promoted liberty and tolerance, and they were strong supporters of the Enlightenment; Beginning in 1737, the freemasons funded the publication of the first Encyclop√©die of Diderot, by a subscription of ten Louis per member per year. By 1771, there were eleven lodges in Paris. The Duke of Chartres, eldest son of the Duke of Orleans and owner of the Palais-Royal, became the new grand master; the masons began meeting regularly in cafes, and then in the political clubs, and they played an important part is circulating news and new ideas. The Freemasons were particularly hard-hit by the Terror; the aristocratic members were forced to emigrate, and seventy freemasons were sent to guillotine in the first our months of 1794. Daily Life =Housing= During the 18th century, the houses of the wealthy grew in size, as the majority of the nobility moved from the center or the Marais to the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, Faubourg Saint-German or to the Faubourg Saint-Honor√©, where land was available and less expensive. Large town houses in the Marais averaged about a thousand square meters, those in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine in the 18th century averaged more than two thousand square meters, although some mansions in the Marais were still considered very large, like the Hotel de Soubise, the Hotel de Sully, and the Hotel Carnavalet, which is now a museum. The Hotel Matignon in the Faubourg Saint-Germain (now the residence and office of the Prime Minister), built in 1721, occupied 4,800 square meters, including its buildings and courtyards, plus a garden of 18,900 square meters. In the center of the city, a typical residential building, following the codes instituted under Louis XIV, occupied about 120 square meters, and had a single level of basement or cellar. On the ground floor, there were usually two shops facing the street, each with an apartment behind it where the owner lived. A corridor led from the small front entrance to a stairway to the upper floors, then to a small courtyard behind the building. Above the ground floor there were three residential floors, each with four rooms for lodging, while the top floor, under the roof, had five rooms. Only about eight percent of the typical building was made of wood, the rest usually being made of white limestone from Arcueil, Vaugirard or Meudon, and plaster from the gypsum mines under Montmartre and around the city. Seventy-one percent of Paris residences had three rooms or less, usually a salon, a bedroom and a kitchen, the salon also serving as a dining room. But forty-five percent of residences did not have a separate kitchen; meals were prepared in the salon or bedroom. In the second half of the century, only 6.5 percent of apartments had a toilet or a bath. =Time, the work day and the daily meals= In the 18th century, the time of day or night in Paris was largely announced by the church bells; in 1789 there were 66 churches, 92 chapels, 13 abbeys and 199 convents, all of which rang their bells for regular services and prayers; sometimes a little early, sometimes a little late. A clock had also been installed in a tower of the palace on the √éle de la Cit√© by Charles V in about 1370, and it also sounded the hour. Wealthy and noble Parisians began to have pocket watches, and needed a way to accurately set the time, so sundials appeared around the city. The best known-sundial was in the courtyard of the Palais-Royal. In 1750, the Duke of Chartres had a cannon installed there which, following the sundial, was fired precisely at noon each day. The day of upper-class Parisians before the Revolution was described in the early 1780s by Sebastien Mercier in his Tableau de Paris. Deliveries of fresh produce by some three thousand farmers to the central market of Les Halles began at one in the morning, followed by the deliveries of fish and meat. At nine o'clock, the limonadiers served coffee and pastries to the first clients. At ten o'clock, the clerks and officials of the courts and administration arrived at work. At noon, the financiers, brokers and bankers took their places at the Bourse and in the financial district of the Saint- Honor√© quarter. At two o'clock, work stopped in the financial markets and offices, and the Parisians departed for lunch, either at home or in restaurants. At five o'clock, the streets were again filled with people, as the wealthier Parisians went to the theater, or for promenades, or to caf√©s. The city was quiet until nine clock, when the streets filled again, as the Parisians made visits to friends. Dinner, or \\"souper\\" began between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock. It was also the hour when the prostitutes came out at the Palais-Royal and other heavily frequented streets. When the souper was finished, between eleven and midnight, most Parisians headed home, with others remained to gamble in the salons of the Palais-Royal. The work day for artisans and laborers was usually twelve hours, from about seven in the morning until seven in the evening, usually with a two-hour break at midday for rest and food. The Revolution, and the disappearance of the aristocracy, completely changed the dining schedule of the Parisians, with all meals taking place earlier. In 1800, few Parisians had a late souper; instead they had their evening meal, or d√Æner, served between five and six instead of at ten or eleven, and the afternoon meal, formerly called d√Æner, was moved up to be served at about noon, and was called dejeuner. =Food and drink= A baker's boy carrying loaves of bread (1737) The basic diet of Parisians in the 18th century was bread, meat and wine. The bread was usually white bread, with a thick crust, good for dipping or soaking up a meat broth. \`For the poor, bread was often the only staple of their diet; The Lieutenant-General of Police, from 1776 to 1785, Jean Lenoir, wrote: \\"for a large part of the population, the only nourishment is bread, vegetables and cheese.\\" The government was well aware of the political dangers of a bread shortage, and closely regulated the supply, the price and the bakeries, but the system broke down in 1789, with disastrous results. A street vendor selling eau-de-vie brandy (1737) According to a contemporary study by the Enlightenment-era chemist Lavoisier, Parisians spent about twice as much on meat as they did on bread, which accounted for only about thirteen percent of their food budget. Butcher shops all around the city provided the meat; the animals were slaughtered in the courtyards behind the shops, and the blood often flowed out into the streets. The better cuts of meat went to aristocracy and the merchant class; poorer Parisians ate mutton and pork, sausages, andouilles, brains, tripe, salted pork, other inexpensive cuts. The uneaten meat from the tables of the upper class was carefully collected and sold by regrattiers who specialized in this trade. Wine was the third basic component of the Parisian meal. Wealthier Parisians consumed wines brought from Bordeaux and Burgundy; the Parisian middle class and workers drank wines from regions all over France, usually brought in barrels by boat or by road. In 1725, there were an estimated 1,500 wine merchants in Paris. The royal government profited from the flood of wine coming to Paris by raising taxes, until wine was the most highly taxed product coming into the city in 1668, each barrel of wine barrel of wine entering Paris by land was taxed 15 livres, and 18 livres if it arrived by boat. By 1768, the government raised the taxes to 48 livres by land and 52 by water. To avoid the taxes, hundreds of taverns called guinguettes sprang up just outside the tax barriers on the edges of the city, at Belleville, Charonne, and new shanty-towns called La Petite-Pologne, Les Porcherons, and La Nouvelle-France. A pint of wine sold in these taverns was taxed 3.5 sous a pint, while the same amount was taxed 12 to 15 sous inside Paris. The tax was hated by the Parisians, and was an important cause of the growing hostility to the royal government before the Revolution. =Drinking water= A Paris water-bearer (1737) For obtaining drinking water, wealthier Parisians usually had wells in their residences, often in the basement. For ordinary Parisians, it was much more difficult. The water of the Seine had been polluted since the Middle Ages by the discharge of human and animal waste, the dumping of chemicals by the tanneries, and by the decomposition of bodies in the many cemeteries not far from the river. In the 18th century the Lieutenant General of Police banned taking drinking water from between the present Quai des Celestins and the modern quai de Louvre. Average Parisians depended upon the fountains around city, which were not numerous, did not run at night, were crowded, and required a payment for each bucket taken. Parisians either collected water themselves, sent a servant, or depended upon water bearers, men who carried covered buckets of water or rolled large barrels on wheels to the residence and charged a fee for the service. There were frequent fights at public fountains between water bearers and domestic servants, and water bearers were known to avoid paying the fee at fountains by simply taking the water from the Seine. In the 18th century, a few enterprising Parisians dug Artesian wells; one well at the √âcole Militaire sent a jet of water eight to ten meters into the air; but the artesian well water was hot and had a poor taste. In 1776, the Perrier brothers started a business delivering three million liters a water a day using steam-powered pumps at Chaillot and Gros-Caillou. Facing the organized hostility of the water bearers, the company went bankrupt in 1788 and was taken over by the city. The water supply problem was not resolved until the First Empire, when Napoleon commissioned a canal from the Ourcq River. =Transportation= There was no public transportation in Paris in the 18th century; the only way for ordinary Parisians to move around the city was on foot, a difficult experience in the winding, crowded and narrow streets, especially in the rain or at night. The nobles and the wealthy traversed the city either on horseback or in chairs carried by servants. These chairs gradually were replaced by horse- drawn carriages, both private and for hire. By 1750, there were more than ten thousand carriages for hire in Paris, the first Paris taxis.Combeau, Yvan, History of Paris, pp. 47-48. =The Bateaux-Lavoirs= The Bateaux-Lavoirs were large flat-bottomed barges, protected by wooden or straw roofs, which were moored at designated places along the Seine and used by laundresses to wash laundry in the river. The laundresses paid the owners a fee for the use of the boat. There were some eighty of them in 1714; groups of six, moored two by two, were anchored across from Notre Dame, near the Pont Saint-Michel, and near the rue de l'H√¥tel-Colbert. They preferred to be on the right bank, so the sunshine could dry the laundry. =The floating baths= In the 18th century only the nobility and wealthy had bathtubs in their homes, at the Marais and Faubourg Saint-Germain, the fashionable districts of the time. Other Parisians either did not bathe at all, bathed with a bucket, or went to one of the public bath houses, which provided hot tubs of water for a fee. They were heavily taxed by the government, and only a dozen survived until the end of the century. The more popular alternative, especially in summer, was bathing in the river from one of the large flat-bottomed bathing barges which were moored along the Seine, particularly on the right bank between the Cours- la-Reine and the Pont Marie. They were mostly former lumber barges, which were covered with wooden or straw roofs. Bathers paid an admission charge, then went down wooden steps from the barge into the river. Wooden pilings marked the limits of the bathing area, there were ropes to the pilings for the assistance of the numerous bathers who couldn't swim. In 1770, there were twenty such bathing barges, located at the Cours-la-Reine, the quai du Louvre, the quai Conti, across from the Palais-Bourbon, and at the western end of the √éle-de-la-Cit√©, an establishment opened by the Canons of Notre-Dame. There were separate barges for men and women, and the bathers were offered bathing costumes for rent, but many preferred to bathe nude, men frequently swam into the women's area or swam along the river in full view of the people on riverbank. In 1723, the Lieutenant-General of Police condemned the baths as an offense to public morality and urged that they be moved from the center of the city, but they were popular and remained. In 1783, the police finally restricted bathing in the river during the day, but bathing at night was still allowed. =The Press, the pamphlet and the Post= The Mercure de France issue of October 1749, dedicated to the King The first daily newspaper in the city, the Journal de Paris, began publication on 1 January 1777. It was four pages long, printed on small sheets of paper, and focused on local news, and what was allowed by the royal censors. The press did not emerge as a force in Parisian life until 1789 and the Revolution, when censorship was abolished. Serious publications, such as the Journal des D√©bats appeared, along with thousands of short pamphlets, addressing the current topics of the day, and often virulent in their language. The period of press freedom did not last for long; in 1792 Robespierre and the Jacobins restored censorship and closed opposition newspapers and printing houses. Strict censorship was retained by governments that followed. Freedom of the press was not restored until the second half of the 19th century. Several weekly and monthly magazines appeared in the early 18th century; the Mercure de France, originally called the Mercure Gallant, had first been published as an annual journal in 1611. An advertisement for an essay contest in the magazine in 1749 inspired Jean- Jacques Rousseau to write his first important essay, \\"Discourse on the Arts and Sciences\\" which brought him to public attention. The Journal des Savants, first published in 1665, circulated the news of new scientific discoveries. Near the end of the century, Paris journalists and printers produced a wide range of speciality publications, on fashion, for children, and on medicine, history, and science. In addition to the official publications of the Catholic church, there was a clandestine religious journal, the Nouvelles Eccl√©stiastiques, first printed in 1728, which circulated the ideas of the Jansenists, a sect denounced by the church. Through the journals, the ideas and discoveries made in Paris were circulated around France and across Europe. In the beginning of the 18th century Paris had a very rudimentary postal service, which had been established in 1644 to carry letters by horseback couriers to other cities in France or abroad, but there was no postal service within the city itself; Parisians had to send a domestic or deliver the letter themselves. In 1758, a private company, called the Petite Poste, was organized to deliver letters within the city, in imitation of the \\"penny post\\" in London. It began to function in 1760; a letter cost two sous, and there were three distributions a day. It was successful, with nine bureaus, with twenty to thirty mailmen per bureau, and five hundred mail boxes around the city. By 1787, there were two hundred mailmen making ten rounds of delivery each day Amusements =Parks, promenades and pleasure gardens= A promenade in the Palais-Royal (1798) One of the chief amusements of the Parisians was to promenade, to see and be seen in the gardens and public places. There were three gardens open to the public in the 18th century; the Tuileries Gardens, the Luxembourg Garden, under the windows of the royal palace; and the Jardin des Plantes. There was a no admission charge, and there were often concerts and other entertainment. It was difficult to promenade in the narrow streets, crowded, without sidewalks and filled with wagons, carts, carriages and animals. At the beginning of the century Parisians preferred to promenade on the wide Pont Neuf. As the century advanced, they were attracted to the new boulevards, built on the site of the old city walls, and to the new Champs- √âlys√©es, where the first large town houses were being constructed. As the boulevards attracted crowds, they also attracted street entertainers; acrobats, musicians, dancers, and every kind of trained animal performed on the sidewalks. The end of the 18th century saw the opening of the pleasure gardens of Ranelegh, Vauxhall, and Tivoli. These were large private gardens where, in summer, Parisians paid an admission charge and found food, music, dancing, and other entertainment, from pantomime to magic lantern shows and fireworks. The admission fee was relatively high; the owners of the gardens wanted to attract a more upper class clientele, and to keep out the more boisterous Parisians who thronged the boulevards. Parc Monceau in 1790 The most extravagant pleasure garden was Parc Monceau, created by Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans, which opened in 1779. it was designed for the Duke by the painter Carmontelle. It contained a miniature Egyptian pyramid, a Roman colonnade, antique statues, a pond of water lilies, a tatar tent, a farmhouse, a Dutch windmill, a temple of Mars, a minaret, an Italian vineyard, an enchanted grotto, and \\"a gothic building serving as a chemistry laboratory,\\" as described by Carmontelle. In addition to the follies, the garden featured servants dressed in oriental and other exotic costumes, and unusual animals, such as camels. In 1781, parts of the garden were transformed into a more traditional English landscape garden, but vestiges of the original follies, including the pyramid and colonnade, can still be seen. By far the most popular destination for promenaders in the late 18th century was the Palais- Royal, the most ambitious project of the Duke of Orl√©ans. Between 1780 and 1784 he rebuilt his family gardens into a pleasure garden surrounded by wide covered arcades, which were occupied by shops, art galleries, and the first true restaurants in Paris. There was a pavilion in the gardens for horseback riding; The basements were occupied by popular cafes with drinks and musical entertainment, and the upper floors by rooms for card-playing and gambling. At night, the galleries and gardens became the most popular meeting place between prostitutes and their clients. =Bouillons and Restaurants= For centuries, Paris had taverns which served food at large common tables, but they were notoriously crowded, noisy, not very clean, and served food of dubious quality. In about 1765 a new kind of eating establishment, called a \\"Bouillon\\", was opened on rue des Poulies, near the Louvre, by a man named Boulanger. It had separate tables, a menu, and specialized in soups made with a base of meat and eggs, which were said to be \\"restaurants\\" or ways of restoring oneself. Dozens of bouillons soon appeared on Paris streets. The first luxury restaurant in Paris, called the Taverne Anglaise, was opened by Antoine Beauvilliers, the former chef of the Count of Provence, at the Palais- Royal. It had mahogany tables, linen tablecloths, chandeliers, well-dressed and trained waiters, a long wine list and an extensive menu of elaborately prepared and presented dishes. A rival restaurant was started in 1791 by M√©ot, the former chef of the Duke of Orleans, by the end of the century there were other luxury restaurants at the Grand-Palais; : Hur√©, the Couvert espagnol; F√©vrier; the Grotte flamande; V√©ry, Masse and the cafe des Chartres (now the Grand Vefour). =Caf√©s= The Caf√© de Procope in 1743 Coffee had been introduced to Paris in 1644, and the first caf√© opened in 1672, but the institution did not become successful until the opening of Caf√© Procope in about 1689 in rue des Foss√©s-Saint-Germain, close to the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, which had just moved to that location. The caf√© served coffee, tea, chocolate, liqueurs, ice cream and confiture in a luxurious setting. The Caf√© Procope was frequented by Voltaire (when he was not in exile), Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Diderot and D'Alembert.Colin Jones, Paris: Biography of a City (2004) pp. 188, 189. Caf√©s became important centers for exchanging news, rumors and ideas, often more reliable than the newspapers of the day.Robert Darnton, \\"An Early Information Society: News and the Media in Eighteenth-Century Paris,\\" American Historical Review (2000) 105#1 pp 1‚Äì35 in JSTOR In 1723, there were about 323 caf√©s in Paris; by 1790 there were more than 1,800. They were places for meeting friends, and for literary and political discussion. As Hurtaut and Magny wrote in their Dictionnaire de Paris in 1779: \\"One gets the news there, either by conversation, or by reading the newspapers. You don't have to encounter anyone with bad morals, no loud persons, no soldiers, no domestics, no one who could trouble the tranquility of society.\\" Women rarely entered caf√©s, but women of the nobility sometimes stopped their carriages outside and were served inside the carriage with cups on silver platters. During the Revolution the caf√©s turned into centers of furious political discussion and activity, often led by members of the Revolutionary clubs. =The Guingette= The Guingette was mentioned as early as 1723 in the Dictionaire du commerce of Savary. It was a type of tavern located just outside the city limits of Paris, where wine and other drinks were taxed less and were much cheaper. They were open Sundays and holidays, usually had musicians for dancing, and attracted large crowds of working-class Parisians eager for rest and recreation after the work week. As time went on, they also attracted middle class Parisians with their families. =Dancing‚ÄîThe Masked ball = Ball for servants on rue du Mont-Blanc (1799) Public balls were banned on moral grounds during the last years of the reign of Louis XIV, and were not permitted again until under the Regency. At this time a royal ordinance of 31 December 1715 authorized the first public balls in the city. These were the famous masked balls of the Paris Opera, which took place on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays beginning on the day of Saint Martin and continuing until Carnival. Culture =The Theater= The theater of Nicolet on the Boulevard du Temple (1760s) Theater was an increasingly popular form of entertainment for the Parisians throughout the 18th century. The number of theater seats grew from about four thousand in 1700 to 13,000 in 1789. In 1760, the boulevard du Temple became the main theater street of Paris, with the opening by Nicolet of the Th√©√¢tre des Grands Danseurs de Roi, which later became the Th√©√¢tre de la Ga√Æet√©. In 1770, the Ambigu-Comique opened on the same street, followed in 1784 by the Th√©√¢tre des √âl√®ves de l'Op√©ra, also known as the Lyc√©e Dramatique. In 1790, the Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s amusantes, originally located on rue de Bondy, moved to the same neighborhood, to the corner of the rue Richelieu and the Palais-Royal. In 1790. The boulevard du Temple and eventually took the name of the \\"Boulevard du Crime\\" because of all of the melodramas that played in the theaters there. Another new theater was opened in 1784 at the northwest corner of the Palais- Royal; it was used first by the company of the Count of the Beaujolais, then by the actress Mademoiselle Montansier. The Com√©diens Italiens moved in 1783 to the Salle Favert. On the left bank, the Od√©on Theater opened in 1782. The most successful Paris playwright was Pierre Beaumarchais who first put on stage the Le Barbier de S√©ville in 1775 in the Tuileries Palace, performed by the Com√©die Fran√ßaise. It was followed by Le Mariage de Figaro, which was accepted for production by the management of the Com√©die Fran√ßaise in 1781, but at private reading before the French court the play so shocked King Louis XVI that he forbade its public presentation. Beaumarchais revised the text, moving the action from France to Spain, and, after more changes, it was finally allowed to be staged. It opened at the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais on 27 April 1784 and ran for 68 consecutive performances, earning the highest box-office receipts of any French play of the eighteenth century. A performance of the Comedie-Fran√ßaise in the late 18th century The most famous of Paris theater companies, the Com√©die-Francaise, was located since 1689 on the rue des Foss√©s-Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s (now 14 rue de l'Ancienne-Com√©die). In 1770, because of the decrepitude of their old theater, they were forced to move to the hall of machines of the Tuileries Palace. The hall was too large and not adapted to their style of theater, so they moved back to the left bank to the Od√©on Theater. With the arrival of the Revolution, the theater company split in two; the actors who were sympathetic to the monarchy remained in place, but on 3 September 1793, after a performance of a play called Pam√©la ou la Vertu r√©compens√© by Fran√ßois de Neufch√¢teau, which the more radical Jacobins felt was counter-revolutionary, the theater was closed. The actors were arrested and barely escaped the guillotine. The actors who were more sympathetic to the Revolution, led by the actor Fran√ßois-Joseph Talma, had installed themselves in a new theater next to the Palais-Royal, built by the architect Victor Louis between 1786 and 1790. They performed first under the name of the Th√©atre de la Libert√© et de la √âgalit√©, then under the name Th√©atre de la Republique; under the Consulate the scripts of their plays were carefully scrutinized by a Commissaire of the government, to assure they did not contain political messages. The political differences of the actors were eventually put aside, the two troupes rejoined into one company, and established themselves in the theater which is still the home of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise today. =Painting and sculpture= The Paris Salon of 1787, by Pierre Antonio Martini Paris produced two important painters at the beginning of the 18th century; Jean- Baptiste Chardin and Fran√ßois Boucher; and two more at the end of the century, Hubert Robert and Jacques Louis David. Other notable painters, including Maurice Quentin de la Tour, Jean-Baptiste Greuze, Joseph Vernet and Jean Honor√© Fragonard came to Paris from the provinces and achieved success. The Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) had been founded under Louis XIV, and from 1667 until 1791 it organized the major artistic event, the Salon, held every two years. It opened on 25 August, the day of Saint Louis, in honor of the King, and lasted for several weeks. In the 18th century was held in the Salon Carr√© of the Louvre (which gave the Salon its name) and gradually expanded over the years to the Gallery of Apollo. At the 1761 Salon, thirty-three painters, nine sculptors, and eleven engravers contributed.Levey, Michael. (1993) Painting and sculpture in France 1700-1789. New Haven: Yale University Press, p. 3. Until 1791, it was limited to members of the Academy, and as many as five hundred paintings were shown at each Salon. On August 8, 1793, the Academy was suspended by the revolutionary National Convention, which decreed the abolition of all the royal artistic and literary academies. During the Revolution, Jacques Louis David, a friend of Robespierre and a member of the radical Jacobin club, became the unofficial minister of propaganda of the Revolution. He created a series of paintings associating the French Revolution with the virtues of the ancient Rome, and designing costumes and pageants for the Revolutionary government. After the fall of Robespierre, he was imprisoned, freed, and at the beginning of the 19th century was painting portraits of Napoleon Bonaparte. =Literature= A reading of a work by Voltaire in the salon of Madame Geoffrin (1755) Of the great French writers of the 18th century, the two most famous, Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, spent most of their careers far from Paris, either in exile or under strict censorship. Early in his career Voltaire had been welcomed to the salon of Madame Pompadour, and had been granted a government pension, which he did not touch for twelve years; the scholar and co-author of the first Encyclopedia, d'Alembert had been provided an apartment in the Louvre; and Rousseau had been feted and welcomed to the homes of the nobility. But under Louis XVI the royal attitudes changed. Voltaire very rarely visited Paris between 1760 and his death in 1784. Rousseau was allowed to return to Paris from exile only on the condition that he not publish any of his work. Nonetheless, the writing of both men was widely read, usually in clandestine editions, and shaped the ideas that led to the Revolution. In the first half of the 18th century, eminent French writers were invited to become members of the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise, but the Academy in practice served largely to glorify the royal family and to keep writers under gentle control, rather to stimulate innovation in literature. Neither Rousseau nor Voltaire were chosen; only one of the great Philosophes of the enlightenment, Montesquieu, was elected a member. His 1748 book The Spirit of the Laws, proposing a separation of powers between the executive, legislature and courts, had an enormous impact on political thinking outside France, especially in England and the United States. Despite censorship and restrictions, Paris was the leading book-publishing center of Europe, and provided books not only to France, but exported them to all the courts and aristocracies of Europe, where French was widely spoken. The plays of Voltaire, Pierre Beaumarchais and Pierre de Marivaux; the novels of Choderlos de Laclos (Les Liaisons dangereuses), Antoine Fran√ßois Pr√©vost (Manon Lescaut) and the poetry of Jacques Delille and √âvariste de Parny were read in all the major cities of the continent, as far away as Saint Petersburg. An important feature of the Paris literary world was the literary salon, where wives of the nobility invited their friends to their homes to hear readings of new books and to discuss literature, and, later in the century, politics. The first famous Paris salon of the 18th century was that of Madame de Lambert in her town house on rue Richelieu in 1710, followed by those of Madames de Tencin, Geoffrin, Du Deffand, d'√âpinay, Helv√©tius, and Necker. The Revolution brought an abrupt end to the literary salons, as the aristocrats were executed or forced into exile, and some of the most promising writers, including the poet Andr√© Chenier, went to the guillotine. The Enlightenment Antoine Lavoisier conducting an experiment related to combustion generated by amplified sun light (1770s) In the mid-18th century, Paris became the center of an explosion of philosophic and scientific activity known as the Age of Enlightenment. The philosophic movement was led by Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who argued for a society based upon reason rather than faith and Catholic dogma, and for a new civil order based on natural law, and for science based on experiments and observation. The political philosopher Montesquieu introduced the idea of a separation of powers in a government, a concept which was enthusiastically adopted by the authors of the United States Constitution. Much of the activity was based at the Louvre, where the French Academy of Sciences, founded in 1666, was located; it had separate sections for geometry, astronomy, mechanics, anatomy, chemistry and botany. Under Louis XVI, the 18th century, new sections were added on physics, natural history and mineralogy. The biologist and natural historian Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon directed the Jardin des Plantes, and made it a leading center for botanic research. The mathematicians Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Jean-Charles de Borda, and Pierre-Simon Laplace; the botanist Ren√© Louiche Desfontaines, the chemists Claude Louis Berthollet, Antoine Fran√ßois, comte de Fourcroy and Antoine Lavoisier, all contributed to the new scientific revolution taking place in Paris. The new ideas and discoveries were publicized throughout Europe by the large number of book publishers in Paris. Between 1720 and 1780, the number of books about science and art doubled, while the number of books about religion dropped to just one-tenth of the total. Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert published their Encyclopedie in seventeen volumes between 1751 and 1766. It provided intellectuals across Europe with a high quality survey of human knowledge. Scientists came to Paris from across Europe and from the United States to share ideas; Benjamin Franklin came in 1766 to meet with Voltaire and to talk about his experiments with electricity. =Inventions= The first manned balloon flight, 21 November 1783, at the Ch√¢teau de la Muette A drawing of the first frameless parachute, tested by Andr√©-Jacques Garnerin above Parc Monceau on 22 October 1797. The 18th century in Paris was a particularly inventive period. Some of the discoveries of Paris scientists, particularly in the field of chemistry, were quickly put to practical use; the experiments of Lavoisier were used to create the first modern chemical plants in Paris, and the production of hydrogen gas enabled the Montgolfier Brothers to launch the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 November 1783, from the Ch√¢teau de la Muette, near the Bois de Boulogne.Sarmant, Thierry, Histoire de Paris, p. 120. The invention of the balloon led directly to the invention of the parachute. Andr√©-Jacques Garnerin, who had flown in a Montgolfier balloon in 1790, wanted to find a vehicle by which a pilot could abandon a balloon in case of an accident. On 22 October 1797 he made the first descent with a frameless silk parachute, dropping from a balloon seven hundred meters above Parc Monceau. On 10 November 1798 his future wife, Jeanne- Genevieve Labrousse, became the first woman to ascend alone in a balloon, and the first woman to make a parachute jump. A more modest but highly useful invention, the folding umbrella, was introduced in 1710 by a Paris merchant named Jean Marius, with his shop at the barrier of Saint-Honor√©. He obtained a monopoly on the manufacture of umbrellas which opened and closed like modern models, and weighed less than one kilogram. A model was purchased in 1712 by the Princess Palatine, who wrote about it to her friends and helped make it a popular fashion item. An important improvement was reported to the French Academy of Sciences in 1759; an umbrella combined with a cane, with a small button the side to open the umbrella. Urbanism Demolition of houses on the Pont Notre-Dame, by Hubert Robert (1786) Paris in the first half of the 18th century had some beautiful buildings, but it was not a beautiful city. The philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau described his disappointment when he first arrived in Paris in 1731: I expected a city as beautiful as it was grand, of an imposing appearance, where you saw only superb streets, and palaces of marble and gold. Instead, when I entered by the Faubourg Saint-Marceau, I saw only narrow, dirty and foul-smelling streets, and villainous black houses, with an air of unhealthiness; beggars, poverty; wagons-drivers, menders of old garments; and vendors of tea and old hats.\\" In 1749, in Embellissements de Paris, Voltaire wrote: \\"We blush with shame to see the public markets, set up in narrow streets, displaying their filth, spreading infection, and causing continual disorders‚Ä¶ Immense neighborhoods need public places. The center of the city is dark, cramped, hideous, something from the time of the most shameful barbarism.\\" In the second half of the century, in keeping with the ideas of the Enlightenment, the administration of Paris, particularly the police, made an effort to improve the way that the city looked and functioned. One example was the sidewalk; in mid-century sidewalks existed in London, but there were none in Paris. The first sidewalk in Paris was begun in 1781, along the new rue du Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßaise, now rue de l'Od√©on, to protect the spectators going along the street to the new theater. The second sidewalk was begun in 1788 along rue Louvois, where another new theater was planned. The sidewalk was four feet wide (1.2 meters) and 10 to 12 inches (thirty centimeters) high, with a stone border. Before the end of the century, several more sidewalks were installed along new streets in the wealthy neighborhoods around the quarter of la Chauss√©e d'Antin. An effort had begun in the 17th century to regulate the height of Paris buildings, which had grown higher and higher, blocking all light to the narrow streets. An ordinance of 18 August 1667 limited the height of buildings to 15.6 meters, the first such limit in the city. Royal declarations in 1783 and 1784 set a limit on the height of buildings determined by the width of the street; For a street at least ten meters wide, the buildings along the street could not be more than twenty meters, or six stories, including the attic. For the narrower streets, less than 7.45 meters wide, the height of buildings was limited to 11.7 meters. The result was to give a uniform appearance and height to the new Paris streets. The city authorities, led by the Lieutenant General of Police, made the first serious efforts to improve traffic circulation in the congested streets of the city, by removing stones and barriers put in front of houses and by restricting the placement of the tables and carts of street merchants. They also tried to improve the bottleneck of traffic created on the ten existing bridges over the Seine. The houses which lined the Pont au Change were pulled down, and a project was launched in 1725 to build a new bridge to connect two of the city's most wealthy new neighborhoods, the Faubourg de rue Saint-Honor√© on the right bank and the Faubourg Saint-Germain on the right bank. Construction on the new bridge did not begin until 1788; stones from the demolished Bastille were used to help finish the bridge, which was dedicated in 1791 as the Pont Louis XVI. It was renamed the pont de la Revolution in 1792; then, in 1795, Pont de la Concorde. An attempt was also made in the late 18th century to improve the quality of street lighting. In 1669, under Louis XIV, the city was already lit with three thousand oil lamps, suspended in the middle of the street at a height of twenty feet, with twenty feet between each lantern, but not every street was lit, and the light was usually very dim; those going out at night or to the theater were usually obliged to hire a lantern-bearer to light their way until the end of the century. Between 1745 and 1769, the old lanterns were gradually replaced by a new model called a r√©verb√®re which, mounted on a lamp post, gave off a much brighter light. By 1789, there were 5,694 new lanterns in service. A few years later the most popular revolutionary song, √áa ira! urged Parisians to hang aristocrats from the new lanterns. The predominant architectural style in Paris from the mid-17th century until the regime of Louis Philippe was neo-classicism, based on the model of Greco-Roman architecture; the most classical example was the new church of La Madeleine, whose construction began in 1764. It was so widely used that it invited criticism: just before the Revolution the journalist Louis-S√©bastien Mercier wrote: \\"How monotonous is the genius of our architects! How they live on copies, on eternal repetition! They don't know how to make the smallest building without columns‚Ä¶ They all more or less resemble temples.\\" Revolutionary Paris (1789‚Äì1799) The storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 during the French Revolution, (Mus√©e de la R√©volution fran√ßaise). =The eve of the Revolution= Louis XVI had ascended the throne of France in 1774, and his new government in Versailles desperately needed money; the treasury had been drained by the Seven Years' War (1755‚Äì63) and the French intervention in the American Revolution. To establish better relations with Paris, in 1774 the King restored the historic Parlement of Paris, France's oldest and highest court of nobles. To save money, he abolished the two companies of musketeers of the Paris garrison, and reduced the number of Gardes Fran√ßaises in Paris from six to four battalions, and dismissed or demoted many of commanders. This significantly reduced the number of loyal soldiers and police available in Paris to defend the government. Between 1784 and 1791, the frivolity of the Court and extravagant expenditures of Marie- Antoinette ruined the public sympathy she had initially enjoyed. Dozens of clandestine pamphlets began to circulate in Paris, condemning the immorality of the Queen and nobility. The royal administration also quickly ruined its reputation with the Parisians. They decided to build a new wall around Paris, not to keep invaders out, but to stop the smuggling of goods into Paris past the tax collectors, merchandise coming into the city. The wall, called the Wall of the Farmers-General, was twenty-five kilometers long, four to five meters high, and had fifty-six gates where taxes had to be paid. Portions of the wall can still be seen at Place Denfert-Rochereau and Place de la Nation, and one of the toll gates in the Parc Monceau. The wall and the taxes were highly unpopular, and, along with shortages of bread, fueled the growing discontent.Combeau, Yvan, Histoire de Paris, pp. 47-48 The King's finance minister, Turgot, tried to reform the finances of the state, reducing state expenses and freeing the prices of grain from state control. Speculation on grain prices drove the price of bread up, leading to bread riots in Paris on 3 May 1775. After supporting Turgot, in 1776 the King dismissed him and refused to make any further major fiscal reforms. The King also lost much of his support within the army. In 1781, the minister of the Army, S√©gur, decided that any candidate to be an army officer had to show four degrees of nobility, blocking any path of advancement for talented but non-noble officers. Even noble officers had to be rich enough to pay a large sum for their promotion. When the Revolution came, the non-noble and less-wealthy officers abandoned the King and joined the Revolutionaries. By August 1788, the government had run out of money, and gave soldiers and government workers and contractors notes promising to pay, rather than cash. Riots broke out, and customs posts all over Paris were attacked and burned. The King gave way and appointed the Swiss-born banker and reformist, Jacques Necker, as his new finance minister. Rioters attack the house of the first prominent Paris industrialist, Jean- Baptiste R√©veillon, on 28 April 1789 The economic crisis within Paris continued to worsen. A trade agreement with England in 1786 allowed British manufactured goods to enter France with low tariffs; as a result, many Parisian workers, particularly in the new textile industry, lost their jobs. Riots broke out in April, as unemployed workers wrecked one textile factory, attacked the home of Jean-Baptiste R√©veillon, the city's most prominent textile factory owner, and attacked police barricades. Twenty-five rioters and twelve members of the Gardes-Fran√ßaises were killed'. The ordinary soldiers of the Gardes, discontented with their role, began to disobey their officers. The weather also contributed to the distress of the city; the winter of 1788‚Äì1789 was exceptionally cold, with an unprecedented ninety-six days of freezing temperatures, reaching to between twenty and thirty degrees below zero Celsius. The price of a four-pound loaf of bread, the standard staple of Parisians, which was 9 sous on 17 August 1788, rose to 14 sous 6 deniers on 1 February 1789. The King, desperate for funds, decided to summon the Estates- General, an assembly of representatives of the nobility, clergy and the \\"Third Estate\\", the wealthy bourgeois and professional class, to raise funds for his government. On May 12, a week after the assembly had begun, Paris elected its Third Estate representatives, led by the prominent astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly. When the meeting began at Versailles he was elected leader of all of the Third Estate deputies. The meeting took place in the tennis court of the Palace of Versailles. On June 23, the King, displeased by the opposition of Bailly and the Third Estate deputies, tried to have them expelled from the meeting. Bailly refused to leave, declaring that \\"A nation assembled cannot receive orders.\\" A large part of the clergy and forty-seven nobles, led by the Duke of Orleans, took the side of Bailly. On June 24 he King was forced to yield and welcomed the new assembly, but soon afterwards, pressured by his court, he tried to regain control and ordered twenty army regiments to march to Paris. July 11, he defied the Estates-General by dismissing his reformist finance minister, Jacques Necker. As news of the dismissal of Necker spread, Paris became extremely agitated. An English visitor named Young described the atmosphere in one Paris caf√©: \\"Not only was the inside of the cafe was full, but there was a crowd of listeners at the doors and windows, listening to the speakers, who, standing on chairs and tables, each had his own small audience. One cannot imagine the thunderous applause that greeted each expression of defiance and violence against the government. I am astonished that the ministry could permit such nests and hotbeds of sedition and revolt.\\" Looting the weapons to the Invalides on the morning of July 14, 1789 (Jean-Baptiste Lallemand) The tensions quickly turned to violence. On 11 July 1789, soldiers of the Royal-Allemand regiment attacked a peaceful demonstration of Parisians protesting the dismissal of Necker on Place Louis XV (now Place de la Concorde).Dictionnaire Historique de Paris, La Livre de Poche, p. 669-676 On 13 July, a mob of Parisians occupied the H√¥tel de Ville, and the Marquis de Lafayette organized a Garde nationale to defend the city against the army. On 14 July, a mob seized the arsenal at the Invalides, acquiring thousands of guns, and stormed the Bastille, a symbol of royal authority, a prison which at the time held only seven prisoners, and was defended by eighty invalid soldiers, reinforced by thirty-six Swiss guards. About forty Revolutionaries were killed in the fighting. The governor of the Bastille, the Marquis de Launay, surrendered and then was killed, and his head put on the end of a pike and carried around Paris. The Provost of the merchants of Paris, Jacques des Fleselles, was also murdered, and his head paraded around the city.Combeau, Yvan, Histoire de Paris, p. 49 The fortress itself was completely demolished by November, and the stones turned into souvenirs.Sarmant, Thierry, Histoire de Paris, pp. 136-137 The King was forced to yield. On the 15th, he withdrew his troops from the city, and on the 16th he recalled Necker to the ministry. The first independent Paris Commune, or city council, met in the H√¥tel de Ville and on 15 July, and chose a new mayor, the astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly. The King himself came to Paris on 17 July, where he was welcomed by the new mayor and wore the tricolor on his hat; red and blue, the colors of Paris, and white, the royal color.Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier Lafayette (marquis de), Memoirs, correspondence and manuscripts of General Lafayette, vol. 2, p. 252. Bread prices remained extremely high, at thirteen and a half sous for a four-pound loaf, as speculators and merchants held back grain to obtain higher prices or to assure reserves for an uncertain future. On 4 October Inflammatory new newspapers appeared, including the Ami de Peuple of Marat and the Chronique de Paris, blaming the aristocracy for plotting to starve Paris. On 5 October 1789, a large crowd of Parisians marched to Versailles and, the following day, brought the royal family and government back to Paris, as virtual prisoners. The new government of France, the National Assembly, began to meet in the Salle du Man√®ge of the Tuileries Palace.Sarmant, Thierry, Histoire de Paris, p. 138 With both the King and Assembly in Paris, the city became calmer, and bread prices came down. On 21 May 1790, the Charter of the city of Paris was adopted, declaring the city independent of royal authority. The city was divided into twelve municipalities (later known as arrondissements), and into forty-eight sections. It was governed by a mayor, sixteen administrators and thirty-two city council members. Bailly was formally elected mayor by the Parisians on 2 August 1790.Combeau, Histoire de Paris, p. 50. A huge celebration, the F√™te de la F√©d√©ration, was held on the Champ de Mars on 14 July 1790 to celebrate the first anniversary of the Revolution. Before a cheering crowd of 300,000 persons, the units of the National Guard, led by the Lafayette, took an oath to defend \\"The Nation, the Law and the King\\", and swore to uphold the Constitution approved by the king.Sarmant, Thierry, Histoire de Paris, p. 138. Nonetheless, tensions remained below the surface; following the seizure of the Bastille, the wealthiest Parisians began to take their belongings and go abroad for their own safety. This had a disastrous effect on the Paris economy, putting out of work dressmakers and tailors, furniture makers, cooks, maids and servants and shopkeepers in the luxury goods business. The F√™te de la Federation on the Champ de Mars celebrated the first anniversary of the Revolution (July 14, 1790) Revolutionary activity in Paris was centered around the new political clubs which quickly appeared. The radical Jacobins had their headquarters in the former convent of the Dominicans on Rue Saint-Honor√©, near the meeting place of the National Assembly in the manege of the Tuileries Palace, and the home of its most famous member, Robespierre. The Club des Feuillants was also headquartered in a former convent, next to the Tuileries; its members supported the Revolution, but wanted to go no further than a constitutional monarchy; its members included Mayor Bailly, the Marquis de Lafayette, Mirabeau and Talleyrand. The supporters of the King and absolute monarchy had their own meeting place, the Club des Impartiaux, in the former convent of the Grands-Augustins, also close to the Tuileries. A former convent of the Franciscans on the left bank, between rue Racine and rue de l'√âcole-de- Medicine, was the home of the club of Cordeliers, founded in April 1790. It included some of the most fervent revolutionaries, including Jean-Paul Marat, Georges Danton, Camille Desmoulins. The left bank was also the home of the printers who produced newspapers and pamphlets which shaped public opinion. Some five hundred new newspapers of all political views appeared in Paris between 1789 and 1792. In 1791, tensions rose again as the Assembly decided to pay the debts of the State by nationalizing the property of the church, and requiring priests to take an oath of loyalty to the government. On 18 April 1791, the King was prevented by angry crowd from taking his family from the Tuileries Palace to the ch√¢teau of Saint-Cloud, despite the intervention of Mayor Bailly and La Fayette. Louis XVI and his family decided it was time to escape, and fled Paris on 21 June 1791, but were captured in Varennes and brought back to Paris on 25 June. Hostility grew within Paris between the liberal aristocrats and merchants, who wanted a constitutional monarchy, and the more radical 'sans-culottes from the working-class and poor neighborhoods, who wanted a republic and the abolition of the old regime, including the aristocracy and the Church. On 17 July 1791, the National Guard fired upon a gathering of sans-culottes on the Champs de Mars, killing dozens. A red flag, the symbol of martial law, was hoisted over the Hotel de Ville, some radical leaders were arrested, the club of the Cordeliers was closed, but the most radical leaders, including Danton, Marat and Desmoulins and Santerre escaped. Bailly and Lafayette lost what remained of their popularity, and open war broke out between the more moderate and more radical revolutionaries. =The fall of the monarchy= Beginning 21 January 1792, the sans-culottes and their leaders from the radical clubs took over the major food depots of the Faubourgs Saint-Antoine, Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, seizing grain and food products and selling them at prices that they thought were fair. The police and national guard did not interfere, but simply maintained order at the markets. Thanks to a slave revolt and anarchy on the French island of Saint- Dominique, sugar supplies to the city stopped, increasing discontent in all the cafes of Paris. The King, a prisoner in the Tuileries Palace, hoped for a military intervention by Austria and Prussia to restore his power. The Radicals and Jacobins newly elected to the National Assembly also sought war, believing it would expose traitors and unite the French against the monarch and their enemies. The French Army had lost most of its officers, who were members of the nobility; six thousand of the nine thousand officers had emigrated. Parisians read in their newspapers that armies of emigres hostile to the Revolution were gathering on the northern and eastern frontiers of France, and were told by the more radical newspapers that aristocrats and their supporters in Paris were secretly preparing to seize power. On 20 April 1792, the Assembly voted for war against the Habsburg Empire. The French army, without officers and with its men in rebellion, lost all discipline. Th√©obald Dillon, an Irish-born French general and aristocrat, was accused by his soldiers of favoring the Austrians and killed. The Jacobins, Cordeliers and their allies were increasingly in control of the legislature meeting in the Tuileries. On 7 May 1792, the assembly authorized the deportation of any priest who refused to take an oath to the government, or was denounced by a citizen. On 29 May, they dissolved the regiment that guarded the King. On 20 June sans-culottes invaded the Tuileries Palace, where they forced the King to put on a red liberty cap and to drink a toast to the nation. General Lafayette disgusted by the actions of the sans-culottes, quit the National Guard and offered to organize a military coup to save the King, but Marie Antoinette refused to allow it, saying, \\"better to perish than to be saved by Lafayette.\\" The storming of the Tuileries Palace and massacre of the Swiss guards, 10 August 1792 The Austrian and Prussian armies began to assemble on the northern and eastern frontiers of France, and the legislature issued a warning that the nation was in danger. On 29 July, at the Jacobins Club, Robespierre demanded suspension of the monarchy, and the election of a National Convention to write a new constitution. On 1 August, news reached Paris that the Duke of Brunswick, commander of the army of the King of Prussia, threatened to destroy Paris unless the Parisians accepted the authority of their king.Sarmant, Thierry, Histoire de Paris, pp. 140-141. Shortly before midnight on 9 August, Danton rang the church bell of the Cordelier Club, signaling an insurrection. The sans-culottes took over the H√¥tel-de-Ville, deposed the Paris City government, put the second mayor of Paris, J√©r√¥me P√©tion de Villeneuve, under house arrest, and established their own government, the insurrectional Commune. At six in the morning on the 10th, armed sans-culottes from the more radical sections of the city, joined by volunteers for the new revolutionary army who had just arrived from Brest and Marseille, attacked the Tuileries Palace. The Palace was defended by two thousand national guardsmen, whose loyalty to the King was uncertain; a company of two hundred volunteer nobles, and nine hundred Swiss guards. Early in the morning the commander of the National Guard at the Palace was invited to an urgent meeting, where he was surprised and murdered. The King and his family were persuaded to leave at the Palace, to take refuge with the National Assembly in the riding academy a short distance away. He had just left the Palace when volunteers from Brest and Marseille forced the gates and the Swiss Guards opened fire. A bloody battle followed, even after the King sent a message ordering the Swiss guards to cease fire. Most of the noble volunteers and remaining National Guardsmen escaped, but two thirds of the Swiss guards, recognizable in their red uniforms, were massacred. On 11 August, the insurrectional Commune declared that France would be governed by a National Convention, which would write a new Constitution. On 13 August, Louis XVI and his family were imprisoned in the Temple fortress. The Commune was composed of two hundred eighty-eight members, mostly from the Cordeliers and Jacobin clubs and mostly from the middle class and liberal professions, including the lawyer Robespierre and Danton, the new minister of justice. As news arrived that the Austrians and Prussians had invaded France and were advancing toward Paris, the Commune imposed harsher and harsher measures, including the arrest of children and wives of those who had emigrated. From 2 to 6 September 1792, bands of sans- culottes broke into the prisons and murdered between a third and half of the three thousand prisoners they found there including priests who had refused to take an oath supporting the government, the surviving Swiss guards, and a large number of common criminals. Voting for members of the Convention took place in early September, under the intimidating eye of the sans-culottes, who filled the Paris voting places. Twenty-four members were elected from Paris, including Robespierre, Danton, Marat, Camille Desmoulins, and the painter David. On 20 September, the hastily assembled revolutionary army won an indecisive victory at Valmy, causing the Prussians to withdraw, and saving Paris from attacks by the royalists. On 21 September, at its first meeting, the Convention abolished the monarchy, and the next day declared France to be a republic. The Convention moved its meeting place to a large hall within the Tuileries Palace. The Committee of Public Safety, charged with hunting down the enemies of the Revolution, established its headquarters close by in the Pavillon de Flore of the Louvre, while the Tribunal, the revolutionary court, set up its courtroom within the old Royal Palace on the √éle-de-la-Cit√©, inside what is now the Palais de Justice.Sarmant, Thierry, Histoire de Paris, pp. 141-143 The Commune, the government of Paris, also held elections, but these were won by the more moderate members, known as the Girondins, rather than the more radical faction, the Montagnards, largely because the election, unlike the Convention vote, was by secret ballot. The minority Montagnards retaliated by calling a meeting of the Commune without notifying the Girondins, redrafted the election rules in their favor, and in February 1793 eliminated the Girondins and elected a city government dominated by the Montagnards and the sans-culottes. The execution of King Louis XVI on the Place de la Revolution. Drums were played loudly so his final words to the crowd could not be heard. =The Convention and the Reign of Terror= The Convention put the King on trial, and after two months, voted by a majority of a single vote, for his execution. On 21 January 1793, Louis XVI was guillotined on the Place de la R√©volution (former Place Louis XV, now Place de la Concorde. Following the King's execution, rebellions against the government broke out in many regions of the country, particularly Brittany and Angevin. The Minister of Defense of the Commune, Dumouriez, tried without success to persuade his soldiers to march on Paris to overthrow the new government, and ended up defecting to the Austrians. To deal with these new threats, real or imagined, on 6 April 1793 the Convention established a Committee of Public Safety, to hunt for enemies and watch over the actions of the government. New decrees were issued for the arrest of families of √©migr√©s, aristocrats and refractory priests, and the immunity from arrest of members of the Convention was taken away. On 10 March the Convention created a revolutionary Tribunal, located in the Palace of Justice. Verdicts of the Tribunal could not be appealed, and sentences were to be carried out immediately. Marie Antoinette was beheaded on 16 October 1793, and Jean Sylvain Bailly, the first elected mayor of Paris, was executed on 12 November 1793. The property of the aristocracy and of the Church was confiscated and declared Biens nationaux (national property); the churches were closed. The government struggled to maintain the food supply to the city, particularly the supply of bread. Bakers were allowed to make only one kind of bread, known as pain de l'√©galit√©, or \\"equality bread\\". Fortunately for the government there was a good harvest and grain was abundant. Firewood and charcoal, needed for cooking and heating, however, were in very short supply, and crowds of sans-culottes frequently invaded the depots. The Convention moved to eliminate all vestiges of religion, the aristocracy, and the old regime. The French Republican Calendar, a new non-Christian calendar, was created, with the year 1793 becoming \\"Year One\\": 27 July 1794 was \\"9 Thermidor of the year II\\". Many street names were changed, and the revolutionary slogan, \\"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\\", was engraved on the fa√ßades of government buildings. New forms of address were required: Monsieur and Madame were replaced by Citoyen and Citoyenne, and the formal vous was replaced by the more proletarian tu.Sarmant, Thierry, Histoire de Paris, p. 144. Stores were forbidden to close on Sunday, and the heads of the statues of Saints on the fa√ßade of Notre-Dame cathedral were decapitated. Streets named for saints had the word \\"saint\\" effaced with a hammer. On 10 November, the first festival of Reason and Liberty was celebrated at the Cathedral. The Festival of the Supreme Being, held on 8 June 1794 on the Champs de Mars, was an official celebration of Cult of reason presided over by Robespierre. On July 27 he was arrested and sent to the guillotine, ending the reign of terror. On December 4, 1793, the relative independence of the city government of Paris that it had enjoyed since 1789 was ended; the districts of the city, corresponding roughly to the present arrondissements, were placed under the control of the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee, with \\"National Agents\\" placed in each district to assure that they observed the decrees of the national government. A struggle for power broke out within the Convention between the supporters of Robespierre and those of Georges Danton, leading to the arrest of Danton and his supporters on 30 March, his judgment by the Revolutionary Tribunal, and his execution on 5 April 1794. On 10 June a new decree deprived those brought before Revolutionary Tribunal of any legal rights. Between 6 April 1793 and 10 June 1794, the Revolutionary Tribune had pronounced 1,250 death sentences in ninety days; between 11 June and 27 July 1794, it issued 1,376 death sentences in just 47 days. Those condemned were sent from the Palais de Justice to the execution site in convoys of carts. The guillotine was moved to the edge of the city, at the 'Barri√®re du Tr√¥ne, farther from the public eye, and the pace of executions accelerated to as many as fifty a day; the cadavers were buried in common graves on rue de Picpus. Among those executed in the last great surge of the reign of terror were the eminent chemist Lavoisier (8 May 1794) and the poet Andre Chenier, executed 25 July 1794, just two days before the end of the Terror. On June 8, 1794, at the debut of the new wave of terror, Robespierre presided over the Festival of the Supreme Being in the huge amphitheater on the Champs de Mars which had been constructed in 1790 for the first anniversary of the Revolution; the ceremony was designed by the painter David, and featured a ten-hour parade, bonfires a statue of wisdom, and a gigantic mountain with a tree of liberty at the peak. The pretensions of Robespierre annoyed many of those present, and there were cries of \\"dictator!\\" and \\"tyrant!\\" from some in the crowd. The growing number of enemies of Robespierre within the Convention began to quietly plot against him. On 26 July, Robespierre, sensing what was happening, gave a long speech at the Commune, denouncing \\"a conspiracy against the public liberties\\", calling for a purge of the Convention and the arrest of his enemies. Instead of supporting him, the more moderate members of the Commune rose and spoke against him. The following day he was prevented from speaking to the Commune. The next day bells were rung calling the sans-culottes to arms to defend Robespierre, but few responded. Early in the morning of 28 July, policemen and members of the National Guard summoned by the Convention invaded the H√¥tel de Ville and arrested Robespierre and his twenty-one remaining supporters. They were guillotined at seven in the evening the same day, before a large and approving crowd. Paris under the Directory (1795-1799) Parisians during the Directory, by Louis-L√©opold Boilly. A decrotteur scrapes mud from the man's boots Following the execution of Robespierre, the executions stopped and the prisons gradually emptied, but the city remained agitated and barely functional. The former city government, the Commune, had virtually disappeared; of the one hundred forty members of its General Council before the Terror, eighty-seven had been guillotined, and forty imprisoned. Of the thirty-three senior city administrators, twenty had been executed and ten imprisoned. It was impossible to have a document registered for lack of living city employees. On August 24, 1794, the new government of France, the Directory created a whole new city government. The forty-eight sections, each governed by a revolutionary committee, were replaced by twelve arrondissements, strictly under the control of the Directory. Each arrondissement was governed by a committee of seven persons, named by the Directory. The police were under the command of a commission named by the national government. On 11 October 1795, the position of Mayor of Paris was abolished, and replaced by a committee of five administrators of the Department of the Seine, with it offices on Place Vend√¥me. The most important person in the new city structure was the Commissaire named by the Directory to supervise the administration of the city, a post which eventually became known as the Prefect of the Seine. The life of ordinary Parisians was extremely difficult, due to a very cold winter in 1794‚Äì95, there were shortages and long lines for bread, firewood, charcoal meat, sugar, coffee, vegetables and wine. The money dropped sharply in value; an assignat, or banknote originally issued for one hundred livres, was worth thirty-four livres at the time of death of Robespierre, and sixteen in March 1795, and 4 in June 1795. Two thousand six hundred Parisians were reported as dying from hunger in January 1795, and two thousand more during the spring. The shortages led to unrest; on 1 April 1795 a crowd of Parisians, including many women and children, invaded the meeting hall of the Convention, demanding bread and the return of the old revolutionary government. They were removed from the hall by the army and the national guard. The city was placed under a state of siege and four members of the previous administration, blamed for the invasion, were promptly deported to Madagascar and Guyana. Another uprising took place on 20 May 1795, with another invasion of the meeting hall by sans-culottes; one deputy was killed and his head paraded around; a group of radical deputies, controlling the hall, voted for a return to the revolutionary government, and bells were rung in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine calling for a general uprising. The uprising went no further; the majority of Deputies returned to the hall and overturned the decision of the radicals, and soldiers surrounded the Faubourg Saint- Antoine and disarmed the sans culottes. The cannons of Napoleon clear rue Saint-Honor√© of royalist insurgents (October 5, 1795) On 3 October 1795, a coalition of royalists and constitutional monarchists made their own attempt to replace the government, taking up arms and marching in two columns on the Tuileries Palace. The first column on Quai Voltaire was met by a young general of artillery, Napoleon Bonaparte, who had placed cannon on the opposite side of the river at the gates of the Louvre and the head of the Pont de la Concorde. The cannon fire broke up the first royalist column. The second column tried to advance on rue Saint-Honore, and briefly took up position at the theater of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise and then made a last stand on the steps of the Church of Saint-Roche, but were unable to resist the cannon fire. The rebellion was finished by six in the evening; about two hundred royalists were killed, and an equal number of supporters of the Convention; Napoleon's career as a commander and political figure was launched. New elections were held in October 1795, and brought into power a government dominated by moderate republicans; the Paris contingent of elected officials included merchants, bankers, notaries, lawyers, as well as more radical revolutionaries and monarchists. Plots and uprisings succeeded one another; a conspiracy of monarchists attempted an uprising on 4 September 1797, but were quickly suppressed by the army. Radical Jacobins won the elections of April 1799, and allied themselves with their arch-enemies, the monarchists, to oppose the Directory. It appeared that the Revolution might begin again, when on 13 October 1799 Napoleon Bonaparte returned from his campaign in Egypt and organized a coup d'√âtat that made him the First Consul. =Parisian society, marriage and divorce= During the Directory, almost all the structures and rules of Paris society had been swept away, but no new structures and rules had yet been created to replace them. The brothers Goncourt meticulously described the period on their Histoire de la soci√©t√© fran√ßaise pendant le Directoire. Caste and rank mattered far less; all the old titles and forms of address had disappeared, along with old customs and social conventions. Men no longer took off their hats when talking to women, and people of different ranks spoke to each other as equals. Society no longer met in private, in the houses of the nobility, but in public, at balls, restaurants and public gardens. As the Goncourts said, \\"social anarchy\\" reigned in Paris: \\"everyone met with everyone.\\" Government ministers could be seen walking or dining with actresses, bankers with courtesans. \\"Liaisons were easy\\", the Goncourts reported, \\"marriage less so.\\" The old system of marriages arranged between families based on fortune, profession, and social condition was less common. Marriages were no longer controlled by the church, but by the new civil code, which described marriage as \\"nature in action.\\" Marriage was seen as a temporary, not a permanent state. Children born outside of marriage were given equal status concerning inheritance and other legal matters as those born to married couples. Divorce was much simpler, and could be requested by either the husband or wife. In one period of fifteen months, 5,994 civil law divorces were granted in Paris, of which 3,886 were requested by the wife. of 1,148 divorces granted on the grounds of \\"incompatibility of humor\\", 887 were requested by the wife. The new system also led to a large increase in the number of children born outside of marriage and not wanted; in 1795 four thousand unwanted children in the Department of the Seine were turned over to founding hospitals. The breakdown of the old system of arranged marriages led to the creation of the first newspaper where men and women could advertise themselves for suitable spouses, called the Indicateur des marriages. it also led to the establishment of the first marriage bureaus. A businessman named Liardot rented a large former mansion, brought in selected eligible young women as paying guests, and invited men seeking wives to meet them at balls, concerts and card games each given at the house each evening. The men were screened by their profession and education. =The Muscadins= Muscadins\\" by Loursay (1795) Even before the end of Robespierre, a new royalist social movement, called the Muscadins had appeared. These were largely upper middle class young men, numbering between and two and three thousand, who dressed in an extravagant fashion, spoke with an exaggerated accent, carried canes as weapons, and, particularly in 1794 and 1795, they patrolled the streets in groups and attacked sans culottes and symbols of the revolution. They tried to be and act like the nobility of the Ancien Regime, and mostly tried to live in the abandoned Marais area. One of the most extreme of the revolutionaries, Marat, the editor of the radical newspaper L'Ami du people (\\"Friend of the people\\") had been assassinated on 13 July 1793, and on 22 September 1794, his ashes had been placed with great ceremony in the Pantheon, alongside those of Voltaire and Rousseau. After the downfall of Robespierre, the Convention issued a decree that no one should be entered in the Pantheon who had not been dead for ten years. The Muscadins went even further, invading the Pantheon, destroying Marat's monument and removing his ashes. =The Arts during the Directory - the Salon and the Louvre= The artists of Paris were in a difficult situation during the Directory; their most important patrons, the aristocracy, had been executed or sent into exile, and a new wealthy class was just being formed. Before the Revolution a half-figure portrait could be commissioned from a less-known artist for three hundred livres. During the Directory the price fell to forty-eight livres. Nonetheless, the Salon took place in the Louvre in 1795 as it had in the years before the Revolution, and each year thereafter. The most prominent artist of the revolutionary period, David, closely connected with the Jacobins, was in seclusion in his studio inside the Louvre, but a new generation of artists showed their works; Fran√ßois G√©rard; Anne-Louis Girodet, a pupil of David, famous for his romantic paintings, particularly a 1797 painting of the prominent actress and courtesan Mademoiselle Lange as Venus; Carle Vernet, the son and father of famous painters; The portrait painter Jean-Baptiste Isabey, who painted all the rulers of France from Marie-Antoinette through Napoleon III; the genre painter Louis-L√©opold Boilly; Antoine-Jean Gros, a young history and landscape painter, who soon achieved fame and a government position in 1796 with a heroic portrait of Napoleon at the battle of Arcole; the romantic landscapes of Hubert Robert; Pierre-Paul Prud'hon, whose work combined classicism and romanticism; and a major neoclassical sculptor from the earlier generation, the sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon, famous for his busts of George Washington and Voltaire.

The idea was accepted by Louis XVI, who in 1789 began work on the Grand Gallery of the Louvre. The Revolution intervened, and on 27 July 1793 the Convention decreed the creation of a Museum of the Republic, which opened on 10 August 1793, the anniversary of the storming of the Tuileries. In 1797, at the end of Napoleon's triumphant first Italian campaign, convoys of wagons began arriving in Paris, carrying bronze horses, Greek antiquities, tapestries, marble statues, paintings and other works of art taken from Italian cities under the terms of peace agreed by the Austrians. They included works by Raphael, Leonardo Da Vinci, Titian, Paolo Veronese and other masters. Other convoys arrived from the Netherlands and Flanders with more art from the Spanish provinces. The more famous works were displayed on wagons in a festive victory parade through the center of Paris. The rest was crammed, unwrapped, into the corridors, galleries and stairways of the Louvre. Work began to rebuild the Gallery of Apollo and other galleries to provide a home for the new art. =Amusement‚Äîthe Ball of the Victims, Pleasure Gardens, and new caf√©s= Balls were banned again by Robespierre and the Jacobins, but after their downfall, the city experienced a frenzy of dancing which lasted throughout the period of the French Directory. The Goncourt brothers reported that six hundred forty balls took place in 1797 alone. Several former monasteries were turned into ballrooms, including the Novicial of the Jesuits, the convent of the Carmelites in the Maris, the seminary of Saint Sulpice, and even in the former cemetery Saint-Sulpice. Some of the former palatial townhouses of the nobility were rented and used for ballrooms; the Hotel Longueville put on enormous spectacles, with three hundred couples dancing, in thirty circles of sixteen dancers each, the women in nearly transparent consumes, styled after Roman togas. In the public balls, everyone danced with everyone; merchants, clerks, artisans and workers danced with shop women and seamstresses. In the more popular public balls, the cavaliers were charged 80 sous for admission, while women paid 12 sous. At more exclusive balls, admission was five livres. Aristocrats who had survived or returned from exile held their own balls in their houses in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. There events called \\"Balls of the Victims\\" were organized, where the invitees had lost at least one parent to the guillotine. The formal dancing of the minuet was replaced by a much more passionate new dance, the waltz, which was introduced to Paris during this time from Germany. For summer evening entertainment, Parisians began to abandon the Tuileries Gardens and the gardens of the Palais-Royal and went to the new pleasure gardens which appeared in the neighborhood between the Grand boulevards and the Palais-Royal. The most famous was the Tivoli, located on rue Saint-Lazare, it had belonged to an aristocrat named Boutin, who was guillotined during the reign of terror. It was enormous, forty arpents in size, and could hold as many as ten thousand persons. It had alleys filled with promenaders, greenhouses, illuminations, an orchestra, dancing, a caf√© and fireworks. Other new gardens competed by adding spectacles and pageants. The √âlys√©e offered a pageant of costumed soldiers on horseback performing elaborate maneuvers and firing weapons. The Mouceaux had performers dressed as American Indians dancing and fighting battles. The Pavillon de Hannovre, formerly part of the residential complex of Cardinal Richelieu, featured a terrace for dancing and dining decorated with Turkish tents, Chinese kiosks and lanterns. Many new restaurants and cafes appeared in and around the Palais-Royal and the new boulevards, usually close to the twenty-three theaters. A new caf√©, Tortoni, specializing in ice creams, opened in 1795 at the corner of rue Taibout and the grand boulevards. The new restaurants in the Palais-Royal were often run by the former chefs of archbishops or nobles who had gone into exile. The restaurant M√©ot offered a menu with over a hundred dishes. Beside M√©ot and Beauvilliers, the Palais-Royal had the restaurants Naudet, Robert, Very, Foy and Hur√©, and the Caf√©s Berceau, Lyrique, Libert√© Conquise, de Chartres, and du Sauvage (the last owned by the former coachman of Robespierre). In the cellars of the Palais-Royal there were more popular caf√©s, usually with music, smaller menus and more reasonable prices. One restaurant in the cellars, Postal, offered a menu for just 36 sous. Many of the cafes in the cellars had orchestras; the most famous was the Caf√© des Aveugles, which had an orchestra of blind musicians. Following the end of the reign of terror, the dining hours for upper-class Parisians returned gradually to what they had been before the Revolution, with d√©jeuner at midday, dinner at 6 or seven in the evening, and supper at 2 in the morning. When the theater performances ended at ten in the evening, the theater audiences went to the nearby caf√©s on the boulevards. =Paris at the end of the century= Paris after the end of the terror, as described by the walls covered with old posters and proclamations, fountains without water, abandoned animals roaming the streets. The churches were closed, emptied of paintings and objects of art, the crosses replaced by a red liberty cap on top of a pike, and the words \\"National Property for sale\\" painted on the wall. The Cathedral of Notre Dame, the statues removed from its facade and the art from its interior, was used as a storage place for kegs of wine. The H√¥tel-Dieu hospital had been renamed the Hospice of Humanity\\", and the 130 sisters of the order of Saint Augustine, who had tended the poor, were gone. Thousands of poor people from the countryside came into seeking the inexpensive bread subsidized by the Commune. Thousands of sellers of wine and spirits set up shop on the streets. The quays of the Seine were transformed into vast outdoor markets, where people sold any bric- a-brac, jewelry or trinkets, books paintings of other items of value they possessed. Many churches and other large buildings had been turned into sales depots, where the belongings of the church or nobles who had emigrated were put on sale. Sainte-Chapelle was turned into a store where papers needed for judicial hearings were sold. Many prominent historic buildings, including the enclosure of the Temple, the Abbey of Montmartre, and most of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s, were nationalized and demolished. Many churches were sold as public property, and were demolished for their stone and other construction material. Henri Gr√©goire, a priest and elected member of the Convention, invented a new word, \\"vandalism\\", to describe the destruction of the churches. A small group of scholars and historians collected statues and paintings from the demolished churches, and made a storeroom of the old Couvent des Petits-Augustins, in order to preserve them. The paintings went to the Louvre, where the Central Museum of the Arts was opened at the end of 1793. In October 1795, the collection at the Petits-Augustins became officially the Museum of French Monuments.Sarmant, Thierry, Histoire de Paris, p. 145.

Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club is one of the 18 member clubs of the English County Championship, representing the historic county of Nottinghamshire, and also competes in major competitions in other formats of the game. Although there are records of a team competing as Nottinghamshire at an earlier date, the current club was established in 1841 and has competed in first-class cricket from 1841, List A cricket from 1963 and Twenty20 cricket from 2003. Unlike most professional sports, in which a team usually has a single fixed home ground, county cricket clubs have traditionally used different grounds in various towns and cities within or close to the county for home matches, although the use of minor \\"out grounds\\" away from the club's main headquarters has diminished since the 1980s. The Nottinghamshire team have played first class, List A, or Twenty20 matches at nine different grounds, although of these only one has hosted Twenty20 games. The current Nottinghamshire club's debut home game in first- class cricket was played at Trent Bridge in Nottingham. The ground had been laid out in the 1830s by William Clarke, captain of the All-England Eleven, who was married to the landlady of the Trent Bridge Inn. Trent Bridge also played host to the club's first home fixtures in the other formats of the game; in List A cricket in 1965 against Wiltshire; and in Twenty20 cricket against Lancashire in 2003. The ground has also been used for matches not including Nottinghamshire, including extensively by England. Other than a single match played in Newark-on-Trent in 1856 and two games played in Welbeck Abbey between 1901 and 1904, Trent Bridge was the home venue for all the county's first-class matches until the 1920s. In 1921 Nottinghamshire began to play at the Town Ground in Worksop, which was used for a single first-class match in most seasons until 1998, and also hosted three List A games between 1970 and 1980. From 1999 until 2014, the only ground used by the club other than Trent Bridge was the Sports Ground in Cleethorpes, which is not actually in Nottinghamshire but in the adjoining county of Lincolnshire. This ground hosted four first-class matches between 1980 and 1990, and five List A matches between 1983 and 2004. In 2015, Nottinghamshire played two List A matches at the John Fretwell Sporting Complex in Warsop, the first time they had played at a ground in their home county other than Trent Bridge for 17 years. The ground has continued to be used, and in 2019 is scheduled to host a first- class match for the first time. Grounds Below is a complete list of grounds used by Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club for first-class, List A and Twenty20 matches. Statistics are complete through to the end of the 2018 season. Only matches played by Nottinghamshire CCC at the grounds since the establishment of the current county club in 1841 are recorded in the table.

First-class cricket matches are designed to be contested over multiple days, with each team permitted two innings with no limit to the number of overs in an innings. List A matches, also known as limited overs or one-day matches, are intended to be completed in a single day and restrict each team to a single innings of between 40 and 60 overs, depending on the specific competition. Twenty20 matches restrict each team to a single innings of 20 overs. B. Minor Counties North played a List A match at the Sports Ground in 1972. The match was against Nottinghamshire, but Minor Counties North were officially the home team. Only the List A matches played at the ground by Nottinghamshire in which they were the home team are included in the totals.

Life and career  =Early career (1970s ‚Äì 1991)= Michael Weston King was born in Derbyshire, England in 1961 but was raised in the Lancastrian seaside town of Southport. King left school when he was 16 and moved to nearby Liverpool to build for himself a musical career. He played guitar as a member of various bands on the edge of the late 70s/early 80s Liverpool post punk scene, most notably with the band he formed with Chas Cole, Fragile Friends, performing at the famed Eric's club just prior to its closure, and leaving two singles and one cassette only album. By the mid '80s, inspired by the latest wave of overseas bands such as R.E.M., Green on Red, The Dream Syndicate and The Triffids, whose influences mirrored his own newly found interest in Gram Parsons, Hank Williams, The Byrds, as well as the new wave of country acts such as Lyle Lovett, Dwight Yoakam and Nanci Griffith, King joined the country rock band Gary Hall and The Stormkeepers. They played together until the band disintegrated in 1991. =The Good Sons= Taking their name from the Nick Cave album, The Good Son, King formed The Good Sons in 1992 as an authentic British alternative to the burgeoning alt country movement. In 1995 they signed to the German label Glitterhouse Records and released their debut album, Singing the Glory Down, which earned a good reception from both critics and the British alt-country scene of the time. The album featured a guest appearance by Townes Van Zandt with whom Michael had toured Europe in 1994 and 1995, singing together \\"Riding on the Range\\" as a duet. The band went on to open for the likes of Joe Ely, Blue Rodeo and Joe Henry. In 1996 they released the album The Kings Highway, and then in 1997 Wines, Lines and Valentines. The Good Sons had ceased to perform in 1999 and King chose to record his debut solo album, God Shaped Hole. The album got released in October 1999, on Glitterhouse Records. The album included the Phil Ochs song \\"No More Songs\\", and a tribute to the now late Townes Van Zandt \\"Lay Me Down\\". Following a series of solo tours around Europe, King reconvened the Good Sons to record their fourth album Happiness in early 2001. The relative failure of the album led to a more permanent break-up of the band. =Solo career= Michael Weston King performing on stage in The Netherlands. In 2002, and after 200 solo shows across Europe and America, King released Live...In Dinky Town, a collection of live and solo performances gathered shows in Hamburg, Austin, Amsterdam, Bilbao and Manchester. The album also featured contributions from Jackie Leven and Andy White. The follow up album A Decent Man produced by Jackie Leven featured guests, including former Icicle Works front man, Ian McNabb. 2004 saw the release of Cosmic Fireworks-The Best of The Good Sons (1994‚Äì2001), on the German label Phantasmagoria. In 2005, Michael Weston King released the album The Tender Place: A Collection 1999‚Äì2005, which put together his best solo creations from A Decent Man and God Shaped Hole albums. The end of 2008 saw the release of a third live album, Crawling Through The USA, recorded during his 2007 and 2008 tours of North America, while work on a pure 'country duets' album, with singer Lou Dalgleish, under the name of My Darling Clementine. The songbook Beautiful Lies ‚Äì The Songs of Michael Weston King was published in 2005. A collaboration with the Irish writer Brian Richmond resulted in a play entitled Happy Infidels, which features 12 songs by King and is based around the lives and loves, hopes and fears, and personal disasters of a young aspiring English musician and a road weary, alcoholic American musician touring across Europe. King wrote and appeared in They Call Her Natasha, with his wife Lou Dalgleish, a musical play, based around the songs of Elvis Costello which was performed at the Edinburgh Festival, and various theatres around the UK. =My Darling Clementine= In 2011, the album he had made in 2009, under the band name My Darling Clementine saw its UK release. Entitled How Do You Plead, it was hailed by Country Music People as the \\"greatest country album ever by a British artist\\". Produced by Neil Brockbank (Nick Lowe), it featured, amongst others, Geraint Watkins and Martin Belmont. The debut single, \\"100,000 Words\\" became a BBC Radio 2 hit, and the album was voted Album of the Year by CMP, Maverick, & 3rd Coast Music Texas, while the British Country Music Association (BCMA) awarded the band \\"Americana Band of the Year\\". My Darling Clementine's second release The Reconciliation? was recorded at the Sheffield studio, Yellow Arch Studios and was produced by Colin Elliot (Richard Hawley, Duane Eddy) and features guest appearances from Kinky Friedman, The Brodsky Quartet & The Richard Hawley band. In 2015, they collaborated with crime writer Mark Billingham to create the story and song album The Other Half, which is also an audiobook and stage show. The album featured actor David Morrissey and musician Graham Parker and was published / released by Hachette Audio. To date, there have been over 150 performances of the show, including a run at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 2015. In 2017 My Darling Clementine released the more country soul orientated album Still Testifying which was recorded in London and produced again by Neil Brockbank (Nick Lowe),(Jim Lauderdale). It was launched with an appearance on BBC Radio 2 with Bob Harris and released by the Dutch record label CRS. Most recently they have collaborated with Steve Nieve on a series of 4 track Ep's called Country Darkness ' re-interpreting the songs of Elvis Costello for duet =Social activism= 2010 saw the release of King's latest solo album, a collection of protest songs entitled I Didn't Raise My Boy To Be A Soldier, which addressed the serious issues facing everyday people in such difficult modern times. In the 12 months following its release, King appeared at many public protests, political rallies and human rights events in the UK, Germany, Scandinavia, North America and by May 2011 played his first live shows in China.

History Winter approached the entrance to the White House, which civilians were allowed to do at the time. He initially rushed past the doorman, and became lost in the darkness of the hall inside. He was promptly caught and ejected. A few minutes later he repeated his attempt, though by this time the White House police chief and several officers were ready; they detained and searched him. An \\"ugly looking\\" clasp knife was found inside one of his pockets. Winter did not attempt to fight the officers, though six were required to convince him to leave. He gave the name Michael Winter and stated he was from Baltimore. He was described as a tall, muscular man approximately 36 years old, having a quiet and collected demeanor and the appearance of a laborer. He said he was a German, and had twice applied to the German Ambassador, Count von Bernstorff, for a letter of introduction to speak to President William Howard Taft, though he had been denied on both occasions. Winter agreed to leave only on the promise that he would be taken to the German Embassy. Winter was taken to a patrol wagon at the back of the White House, which instead took him to the nearest police station, and then to the Washington Asylum. He answered all the officers' questions, except that he refused to specify what it was he wanted to talk to the president about, stating only \\"I want to see the president, I must see him.\\" The New York Times reported that it was believed he intended to assassinate the president. The Day Book stated that Winter was believed to be mentally incompetent, though upon being booked into the asylum, he was regarded as \\"harmless.\\" On 14 April 1912, The New York Times stated that he was to be \\"examined as to his mental soundness.\\" On 17 April The Chatham Record said that according to officials from the asylum, Winter showed no signs of insanity. On June 3, 1912, The Washington Times reported that Winter was one of three people to escape from the asylum in a thirty-six-hour period. They also reported that Winter had wanted to see president Taft about having all $10 notes withdrawn from circulation and replaced by smaller ones. According to a 2009 article by Wil Haygood from The Washington Post, there is no record of what became of Winter.

He has been a member of the South Australian House of Assembly since 2015, representing Davenport until 2018 and then Waite. He is an independent, but was formerly a Liberal.2015 Davenport by-election: Antony Green ABC Duluk was born in the Victorian town of Mildura, and is descended from post-war migrants from Poland. He was raised in Adelaide and educated at Marryatville High School, then graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce (Accounting) from the University of Adelaide, working as an accountant in the banking industry. He was state president of the South Australian Young Liberal Movement. Duluk won Davenport at a 2015 by-election, despite a five percent two-party-preferred swing against him, which turned the historically safe Liberal seat of Davenport in to a marginal one for the first time. After a redistribution transferred most of his constituents to the neighbouring seat of Waite, Duluk opted to contest Waite and won. On the first sitting day of 2020, Duluk expressed regret for several alleged instances of inappropriate behaviour at a parliamentary Christmas party in December 2019. The Speaker, Vincent Tarzia, commissioned a private investigator to produce a report into Duluk's conduct, which allegedly included slapping SA Best MLC Connie Bonaros on the backside and making racist and homophobic comments to other MPs. A week later, after police confirmed Duluk had been reported for \\"basic assault\\" over the incident concerning Bonaros, the South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, said that Duluk could no longer attend meetings of the Parliamentary Liberal Party. Duluk subsequently announced that he would take leave from parliament and suspend his membership of the party while the matter was under investigation. Two days later, the SA Liberal Party executive expelled Sam Duluk from the party. In April, he was summonsed to appear in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on 6 October 2020. He apologised in parliament for his behaviour and said he was seeking help in combating an alcohol problem.

And both the puppets of Jonathan Small and Arthur Morstan have the atmosphere of the members of a famous British musical band., twitter of Sherlock Gakuen(Japanese) Plot One night Arthur Morstan, a pupil of Archer House is attacked and gets injured. His younger sister Mary Morstan requests Sherlock Holmes to solve why his brother is attacked while John H. Watson falls in love with her. They began searching Arthur's room with the help of Abdullah, roommate of Arthur. Holmes suspects that the offender stole into the room from skylight and he and Mary find small handprints around it on the roof. Watson tries to get up on the roof also but he falls and injures his cheek. Holmes sticks the broken pieces on Arthur's bed and finds it's a piece of paper with the sign of four people - Arthur, Bart, Thady, and Jonny. He asks Langdale Pike to check who they are. Pike sells Watson two containers of ointment as substitute for search fee and Watson heals his injury with it. According to Pike's search, Bart and Thady are the Sholto twins of Dealer House who form a vocal group the Treasures with Arthur, who makes a song titled Agra Treasure and his friend Jonny. Holmes, Watson and Mary visit Thady who will enter a musical competition between schools with the song but they are obliged to remove Jonny as a member because it is for pupils only and Jonny is not a pupil of Beeton School. And he says it's Jonny who attacks Arthur. At this moment, Bart returns to the room and makes them drive away. Holmes thinks that it seems to be another reason why Arthur is attacked and it is proved by Pike's another search that Jonny is a mailman. Holmes identifies him as Jonathan Small, who entered 221B while singing with Mrs. Hudson one morning. That night Jonny hides himself in the school and commands his pet monkey Tonga to attack a room of Dealer House. The Sholto twins are attacked. Holmes and Watson go to nurse's office where the twins are treated and heard about the affair by Grimesby Roylott, who is in charge of giving life guidance. Holmes asks them who did it but they try to keep it a secret and insist that it's caused by the quarrel between them. School nurse Irene Adler tells Holmes and Watson that both the twins have scratch marks but their nails are short. She asks Holmes whether he is rewarded for solving affairs or not and Holmes answers her that the work is his reward. Holmes and Watson search the twin's room ignoring the warning of Gordon Lestrade, member of life-guidance committee and find a piece of the score of Agra Treasure left with other ones.The words \\"Where does a wise man hide a leaf? In the forest.\\" from \\"The Innocence of Father Brown\\" are quoted in this scene. It is clear that the offender is still in the school to steal it. He brings Toby from Sherman's shed to the room for his search but it ends in failure. Then he gathers Baker House Irregulars, a group of rats led by Wiggins and at last they find Jonny with Tonga on the roof of Dealer House, where he goes up on to avoid Toby and make them fall. Holmes runs up to Jonny and says to him \\"The game is over, Jonathan Small\\". The reason why Jonny attacks Arthur, Bart and Thady is not the exclusion from the Treasures. Jonny tells them that Agra Treasure is his original tune whose title was You Are My Treasure and Arthur took down in musical notation for Jonny cannot write a score. Arthur, who once decided that he declined entering the music competition but he takes back what he said and changes its title and part of the words. It makes Jonny angry, so he steals the scores at midnight. Then Arthur appears before them and says that the discord among them doesn't bring good harmony. Finally Jonny is reconciled with him, Thady and Bart at nurse's office. Besides Holmes discloses the fact that Jonny sent picture postcards to Mary every week before her entering to Beeton School for he loved and still loves her.

It was Lewis's \\"comeback album\\" and features a stripped down, \\"hardcore\\" country sound that yielded two top 5 country hits, the icon's first major chart success in a decade. Background By 1968, Jerry Lee Lewis had been touring the United States and Europe consistently for ten years in hopes of re-establishing the stardom that he had enjoyed during his time at Sun Records in the 1950s, before his marriage to his thirteen- year-old cousin Myra derailed his career. Although he remained a riveting live performer (as can be heard on the album Live at the Star Club, 1964), he had not been a relevant presence on the charts, although he had scored a minor hit with a cover of the Ray Charles song \\"What'd I Say\\" in 1961. In 1963, Lewis left Sun for Smash (later absorbed into Mercury Records) but, despite a string of musically diverse albums, did not score another hit. \\"When the DJs stopped playing my records, I never said anything,\\" Lewis explained in the sleeve for the 2006 retrospective A Half Century of Hits. \\"What could I do?

I was making ten thousand a night, and got knocked back to two-fifty.\\" Frustrated at what he saw as a lack of support from his record label, Lewis was nearing the end of his contract when promotions manager Eddie Kilroy called him and pitched the idea of cutting a pure country record in Nashville. By this point, Lewis' commercial stock was extremely low. In Nick Tosches Lewis biography Hellfire, Kilroy recalls calling every credible publisher in Nashville asking for material for Jerry Lee, but only three acetates turned up after two weeks, adding, \\"That was all the material that had come in. Nobody wanted a Jerry Lee Lewis cut. I thought, Holy God, this is embarrassing.\\" With nothing to lose, Lewis agreed to record the Jerry Chestnut song \\"Another Place, Another Time,\\" which was released as a single on March 9, 1968, and, to everyone's amazement, shot up the country charts. At the time of the release, Lewis had been playing Iago in a rock and roll adaptation of Othello called Catch My Soul in Los Angeles but was soon rushed back to Nashville to record another batch of songs with producer Jerry Kennedy. In a 2019 interview with Randy Fox of Vintage Rock, Kennedy recalled: Recording Although he was primarily known as a rock and roller, Lewis had been influenced by a wide range of artists and styles, from rhythm and blues to the Great American Songbook, but his affinity for country music ‚Äì especially the songs of Hank Williams ‚Äì remained a major part of his repertoire. As country music historian Colin Escott observes in the sleeve to the 1995 compilation Killer Country, the conversion to country music in 1968 \\"looked at the time like a radical shift, but it was neither as abrupt nor as unexpected as it seemed. Jerry had always recorded country music, and his country breakthrough 'Another Place, Another Time' had been preceded by many, many country records starting with his first, 'Crazy Arms,' in 1956.\\" The last time Lewis had a song on the country charts was with \\"Pen And Paper\\" in 1964, which had reached number 36, but \\"Another Place, Another Time\\" would go all the way to number 4 and remain on the charts for 17 weeks. The production of the album that followed was sparse, quite different from the slick \\"Nashville sound\\" that was predominant on country radio at the time, and also expressed a full commitment by Lewis to a country audience. Lewis released the Glenn Sutton-penned \\"What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)\\" as his next single, which rose to number 2 on the Billboard country chart, giving him his second consecutive top 5 hit. Featuring Kennedy's chiming lead guitar and Charlie McCoy's campfire harmonica intro, Lewis biographer Joe Bonomo writes in his book Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost And Found: \\"The arrangement, including a woodblock rather than a snare, is prime honky-tonk: no instrument dominates, all complement...Everyone involved in the recording must have known that it would be a hit.\\" Never much of a songwriter himself, Lewis included two other Chestnut songs, including \\"Play Me A Song I Can Cry To\\" and \\"On The Back Row,\\" and fleshed out the album with covers of popular country songs, such as the Merle Haggard hit \\"I'm A Lonesome Fugitive\\" and the Ernest Tubb classic \\"Walking The Floor Over You.\\" He also recorded the Fred Rose country standard \\"We Live in Two Different Worlds\\" as a duet with his sister Linda Gail Lewis. All the songs feature stone country arrangements, augmented by Lewis's inimitable piano flourishes, but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneer's effortlessly soulful vocals, which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time, such as Haggard and George Jones. In his book Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story, biographer Rick Bragg notes that the songs Lewis was recording \\"were of the kind they were starting to call 'hard country,' not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way, but because it was more substantial than the cloying, overproduced mess out there on country radio.\\" Rocker and Lewis fan Rod Stewart covered \\"What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)\\" in 1972 and joined Lewis on a rendition of the song for Jerry Lee's 2006 album Last Man Standing. Reception Another Place, Another Time was released in June 1968 and rose to number 3 on the Billboard country albums chart. In the February 1, 1969, issue of Rolling Stone, critic Andy Boehm wrote that the album was \\"definitely worth buying if you can find it. For rock aficionados Another Place Another Time is an interesting representation of an early rock & roll star's transformation. For country music lovers, this album introduces another great and moving singer.\\" AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes of the album: \\"Song for song, there's not a bad tune here, and each performance is a stunner, making for not just a great second beginning, but for one of the greatest hardcore country albums ever.\\" In 2009, producer Jerry Kennedy told Lewis biographer Joe Bonomo that when the album hit a quarter-million sales, Mercury's Chicago office called him to ask what pop stations were playing it \\"because it couldn't be selling that many country. And it was not playing on pop anywhere. It was all country radio doing the job.\\" Track listing References Category:Jerry Lee Lewis albums Category:1968 albums Category:Albums produced by Jerry Kennedy Category:Smash Records albums ","title":"Another Place, Another Time (album)"},{"id":"45266140","text":"Trichopteryx is a genus of African plants in the grass family.Nees von Esenbeck, Christian Gottfried Daniel. 1836.

Location Broch of Ayre is found on the northern shore of Loch Ayre, in the parish of Holm on Orkney Mainland. History Broch of Ayre was first excavated in December 1901 and then again in the summer of 1909. Little now survives, though part of the broch wall is still extant. The excavations revealed traces of internal architecture and external, probably later, structures. Description The 1901 excavations revealed that the broch wall survived to over a metre in height in parts, with an entrance passage facing to the south-east. The passage contained a broken lintel and architectural features including a guard cell. The interior of the broch contained radial partitions using vertical slabs of stone, and a lintelled well. The broch itself was almost eighteen metres in external diameter, with walls almost five metres thick in places. The 1909 excavation revealed external buildings, likely built later, and the interior of the broch may also have been re-used and partially remodelled in a subsequent phase. Archaeological Finds A number of iron objects were discovered, including two spearheads and an axehead. Locational information from the excavation is poor, although one of the spearheads was found associated with the guard cell. Nail heads, bronze pins and a bronze ring were also found. Evidence of metal-working, including a mass of conglomerate with fused pottery and iron, was also found. Bone pins, combs, antler fragments and cetacean bone vessels were found along with several dice. A large quantity of pottery was also found, along with the remains of whale, seal, ox, pig, red deer, sheep, horse, gannet and other birds, and human bone.

Inshlampie broch is situated in a rich archaeological landscape; Skaill chambered cairn is across the Naver river and a burial ground is situated north of the cairn. Along the Inshlampie burn are hut circles and south of the broch are settlement ruins. History Description No chambers are visible in the remains of this broch, though it is presumed that the entrance is located on the west-north-west side. The approximate external diameter of this possible broch is 15.5 metres, with an internal diameter of 6.5 metres. In the early 20th century AD the walls were preserved up to a height of 1.2 metres, though this had decreased significantly over time so that by the mid 1980s very little of the broch remained visible. The remains of other structures were visible on the terraced land between the west side of the broch and the river, and on the east side of the broch was another terrace that may have been bordered by a ditch that was situated across the promontory. Traces of enclosures can be seen to the south and east of the broch mound and there are further traces of a large wall at the foot of the outer slope. Without the current tree cover, the Langdale Broch 4 kilometers to the south-west would be visible.

It is approved for use in form of the combination drug trifluridine/tipiracil for the treatment of unresectable advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer. Tipiracil helps maintain the blood concentration of trifluridine by inhibiting the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase which metabolizes trifluridine. Adverse effects Adverse effects were not assessed independently of trifluridine, but only in the combination drug.  Interactions  Only in vitro interaction studies are available. In these, tipiracil was transported by the solute carrier proteins SLC22A2 and SLC47A1. Drugs that interact with these transporters could influence blood plasma concentrations of tipiracil. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Tipiracil is a thymidine phosphorylase (TPase) inhibitor and inhibits degradation of trifluridine by inhibiting TPase, thus increasing systemic exposure to trifluridine when tipiracil is given together with trifluridine. =Pharmacokinetics= At least 27% of tipiracil is absorbed from the gut. In cancer patients, highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after three hours. The substance has no tendency to accumulate in the body. The in vitro protein binding in human plasma is below 8%. Tipiracil is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.

Saint John, created by Eric Fournier, was described with a backstory claiming she was a supermodel disfigured in a car crash, who rebuilt her body with a collection of mannequin parts. Shaye Saint John The character of Shaye Saint John is described as a \\"model\\", and is shown in videos wearing a plastic mask, a series of wigs and dresses, and manipulating wooden hands on sticks. She is described as having been hit by a train which resulted in the loss of her arms and legs. Instead of using prosthetics, she added mannequin parts to her face and added wooden hands so no one could see her badly deformed hands. Saint John wears a series of masks throughout her videos, supposedly because she doesn't want anyone to see what she really looks like. Creator Eric Fournier has said \\"It's really bad, that's why she wears the mask\\". In 2003, the character started a blog at LiveJournal. A YouTube channel named Elastic Spastic Plastic Fantastic was created on 30 August 2006 and uploaded all 56 of the 'Shaye' videos in 2006-2007. The official channel was discontinued and cancelled on December 22, 2017. Eric Fournier Eric Fournier was born in Bloomington, Indiana in 1968.

The Rhodesian Air Force planned a retaliatory raid against a ZIPRA camp in Angola after a second Air Rhodesia Viscount was shot down on 12 February 1979. Operation In retaliation for the downing of an Air Rhodesia Flight 827, the Rhodesian Air Force (RhAF) planned a bombing raid against a ZIPRA training camp situated nearby the town of Luso in Angola. The Rhodesians estimated that there were 3000 ZIPRA soldiers, as well as Cuban and East German advisors, based there. The Rhodesians were only able to provide four Canberra bombers for the raid and required three additional aircraft which would be provided clandestinely by the South African Air Force (SAAF). Three SAAF Canberra bombers of 12 Squadron, under the command of Major Hannes Bekker, were armed with Alpha cluster bombs and took off around 18h15 from Air Force Base Waterkloof, South Africa on 25 February 1979. From there they flew northwards to the Victoria Falls airfield in Rhodesia and landed after dark. There the navigators planned the raid for the following morning. The strike leader was Squadron Leader Chris Dixon, 5 Squadron Rhodesian Air Force, call- sign Green Leader. Three SAAF and three RhAF were armed with 5 Alpha bombs each while the last Rhodesian Canberra bomber was armed with six 1000 lb bombs. The flight of seven bombers took off at 06h30 on 26 February 1979 headed for the target, which was located to the north-west. Additional Rhodesian aircraft were provided in the form of one Dakota command and control aircraft and two Hawker Hunter fighters. Initially command passed to Flight Lieutenant Ted Brent because of radio problems, but would return to Chris Dixon later in the flight. The flight headed over Zambia and then into Angola, dodging both countries' air defence radars, before turning towards the Benguela Railway west of Luso which followed east toward the target. By this time they had formed into two formations of four and three bombers, line abreast, hitting a rainstorm which cleared up two minutes from the target. The bombers, now line-abreast dropped to a height of 300 ft so that the Alpha bombs, a type of cluster bomb, would cover an area 300 by 1000 meters. As they attacked, rows and rows of bungalows could be seen by the pilots with no anti- aircraft fire received, nor vehicles seen nor anyone on the parade ground, giving the pilots the impression of an empty camp. Aftermath Having attacked the target successfully, the bombers returned to Rhodesia, the SAAF bombers to Flyde near Hartley while the RhAF bombers flew back to Victoria Falls with one 1000 lb bomb before refueling and joining the SAAF aircraft. Photographic evidence captured by a SAAF bomber showed the camp was occupied and there were anti-aircraft guns. It was said 160 ZIPRA soldiers died and another 530 were wounded.

On February 20, 2016, Bush announced his intention to drop out of the presidential race following the South Carolina primary. Had Bush been elected, he would have been the first president from Florida and the first sibling of a U.S. president (George W. Bush) to win the presidency himself. Bush was not the first sibling of a former president to seek a party's nomination. President John F. Kennedy's brothers Robert and Ted both sought the Democratic nomination. Additionally, a pair of brothers had once- before both received nominations on a major party ticket. William Jennings Bryan was the Democratic nominee for president in 1896, 1900 and 1908. His brother, Charles W. Bryan, was the Democratic nominee for vice-president in 1924. Bush was assumed to be a near lock for the Republican nomination early on, and his candidacy, in which he failed to finish higher than fourth in a single primary election, is widely considered to have been a shocking fiasco. Background Governor Jeb Bush (R) with his father and brother, former President George H. W. Bush (L) and then-President George W. Bush (C) in 2006 In 1994, Bush was the Republican nominee for Governor of Florida, losing narrowly to the incumbent Lawton Chiles. Four years later, in 1998, Bush ran again, defeating Lieutenant Governor Buddy MacKay (incumbent Governor Lawton Chiles would die in early December 1998, so although defeating McKay, Bush succeeded McKay, who ascended upon Chiles' death). He was reelected in 2002 by a sizeable margin. The second-born son of George H. W. Bush and younger brother of George W. Bush, the 41st and 43rd Presidents of the United States, respectively, Jeb Bush would have been, had he been elected, the first brother of a President, and his father, George H. W. Bush, would have been the first President to have two sons hold the same office. There had been speculation that Bush would make a run for President since the end of the 2012 election. Speculation was fueled when he announced he would be \\"actively exploring\\" a run for President on December 16, 2014, and resigned from several corporate boards. It was further speculated that Bush had put off formally announcing a candidacy in order to raise unlimited amounts of money for his Right to Rise Super PAC, and prepare strategy; once formally a candidate, one cannot coordinate with PACs or Super PACs under campaign finance law. =Exploration of a candidacy= Jeb Bush speaking at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference in March 2015. On December 16, 2014, Bush announced the formation of The Right to Rise PAC, a Super PAC intended to serve as an exploratory committee and fundraising mechanism for a potential candidacy. While not formally a candidate, he was the first potential contender to make any major moves toward the beginning of the 2016 election cycle. Widely seen as the 'establishment' candidate, Bush was expected to court and win donors who were central to the 2012 presidential election on the Republican side. While having repeatedly said he would not run again, 2012 nominee Governor Mitt Romney told donors in early January 2015 that he was seriously considering another run. With early polling showing significant buyer's remorse among many who voted for President Obama in 2012, and showing that he would defeat Hillary Clinton, Romney likely saw it necessary to see if he could tap into his donor base again, to which Bush was the likely successor. After several weeks' consideration, Romney chose against running again, after receiving criticism from many in his own party who wanted a fresher face, and having lost many staff who joined Bush's team before Romney reconsidered. With Romney conclusively out of the race, Bush was seen as the likely front runner for the nomination. In February 2015, Bush preemptively released his official emails from his time as Governor of Florida, which came with some controversy as personal information, which was soon redacted, was included in the release. By extending the 'exploration mode' of his 'potential candidacy' to a six-month period (his scheduled announcement one day short of six months after his exploratory phase), Bush used his time to get acquainted with the press, court donors, and prepare strategy. In doing this, he got around several campaign finance laws which limit donations which persons may make to individual's campaigns, and which prohibit Super PACs from directly coordinating with candidates' campaigns. By May 2015, it was roughly estimated that Bush had raised in excess of $100 million for his Right to Rise PAC, which is expected to exceed his challengers in the Republican field. On June 13, 2015, polling showed Jeb Bush to have support of 17.8% of the Republican electorate. No other Republican candidate was even polling in the double digits. One of the largest issues expected to face Governor Bush was the unpopular image of his brother, President George W. Bush, as well as many who said they did not wish to see a third Bush in the presidency. Governor Bush came out saying \\"I'm my own man\\" with regard to his policies and vision, further saying \\"I love my mom and dad. I love my brother, and people are just going to have to get over that.\\" Governor Bush publicly stated that his brother was his \\"top foreign policy advisor\\", having learned from his brother's presidency about \\"protecting the homeland\\", and that his brother \\"kept us safe.\\" Bush appeared as Bob Schieffer's final interview guest on Face the Nation during his retirement episode. =The Kelly File interview= In an interview with Fox News' Megyn Kelly, which aired on The Kelly File on May 11, 2015, Bush was questioned on a wide variety of topics, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Asked by Kelly: Bush's answer to the question implying whether or not his brother, the President, made a mistake, generated controversy on both Republican and Democratic sides. The following day, in a radio interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Bush said \\"clearly there were mistakes as it related to faulty intelligence in the lead-up to the war and the lack of focus on security;\\" throughout the remainder of the week, Bush issued various answers on the topic. At a May 13 event in Nevada, Bush further said \\"...if we're going to get into hypotheticals I think it does a disservice for a lot of people that sacrificed a lot.\\" By the week's end, May 15, Bush backed off his original statements, saying definitively, \\"knowing what we know now I would not have engaged ‚Äî I would not have gone into Iraq.\\" Campaign =Logo= In a branding decision, the Bush campaign unveiled a logo featuring his name with an exclamation mark that conspicuously left out the Bush surname. Although the logo was merely a variation of the campaign logo used since his first race for governor in 1994, it received criticism and was the subject of internet satire due to its use of the exclamation point and \\"whimsical\\" font. On a September 2015 episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Bush defended his campaign logo, saying \\"I've been using 'Jeb!' since 1994 ‚Äî it connotes excitement.\\" =Announcement and preliminary campaign= Jeb Bush speaking at a town hall campaign event in Ankeny, Iowa. On June 4, the same day as Governor Rick Perry's formal campaign announcement, an anonymous Bush staffer leaked that Bush would formally announce his candidacy on June 15. Bush made a trip to Germany, Poland, and Estonia before returning to begin his campaign. On June 15, 2015, Bush formally announced his candidacy at Miami Dade College's Kendall Campus, in Miami, Florida. Bush embarked on a tour following his June 15 announcement, with stops in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada. The Bush campaign cancelled events in Charleston, South Carolina, in light of the June 17 mass shooting. In early August 2015, while speaking at the Southern Baptist Forum in Nashville, Tennessee, Bush questioned the $500 million in federal funding for Planned Parenthood; a line from Bush's speech, \\"I‚Äôm not sure we need half a billion dollars for women‚Äôs health issues\\", garnered criticism and became a talking point at the August 2015 Republican Debate. Bush later said that he \\"misspoke\\", and that he meant to say that he would like the funds redirected to other women's health organizations, in line with his record as Governor of Florida; in 2003, Bush redirected $124,000 in funding from Planned Parenthood toward abstinence-only sex education programs. On August 11, 2015, Bush gave a major foreign policy speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, outlining his positions on Middle Eastern issues. =\\"Jeb Can Fix It\\"= In November 2015, following a lull in poll numbers, Bush kicked off a tour to re-invigorate interest in Florida, South Carolina, and New Hampshire, dubbed the \\"Jeb Can Fix It\\" tour. The tour accompanied the release of an e-book titled \\"Reply All\\", which consisted of 730 pages of self-selected e-mails that Bush sent and received during his tenure as Governor of Florida. =Tension with Donald Trump= The dynamic between Bush and opponent Donald Trump was one of the more contentious relationships among the Republican contenders. Trump repeatedly mocked Jeb Bush with the epithet that he was \\"low energy\\". http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-jeb-bush-low-energy-2015- https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/01/us/politics/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-bush- campaign.htmlwork=The New York Timesaccessdate=February 14, 2016date=January 31, 2016}} Trump told CNN \\"the last thing we need is another Bush\\" in the White House after the much-criticized presidencies of his father and brother. Trump criticized Bush's elder brother and his role in the Iraq War throughout the Republican debates, leading Bush to defend his brother. During an exchange between Bush and Trump in the ninth Republican primary debate, the audience repeatedly booed Trump. Trump scoffed that the audience was made up of \\"Jeb's special interests and lobbyists\\". In August 2015, the Trump campaign released an attack ad against Bush known as the \\"Act of Love\\" ad. The advertisement played footage of Bush from a 2014 interview, where he characterized illegal entry into the U.S. by undocumented migrants as \\"an act of love.\\" The ad showed mugshots of illegal immigrants who committed violent crimes in the U.S. interspersed with footage of Bush saying, \\"Yeah, they broke the law, but it's not a felony.... It's an act of love.\\" During the August 6, 2015 Republican Presidential debate, Bush defended his \\"act of love\\" statement, saying, \\"I believe that the great majority of people coming here illegally have no other option. They want to provide for their family.\\" He added that \\"there should be a path to earned legal status\\" for illegal immigrants. According to The Washington Post, the most telling aspect of the Bush‚ÄìTrump duel may have been the fact that, \\"No candidate in the race was prepared for GOP voters' opposition to immigration, with the exception of Trump\\". Conservative political analyst Michael Barone pointed to Trump's two- pronged attack on Bush in the August Republican primary debate, for the \\"act of love\\" position on illegal immigration and for being weak, as a key moment in Trump's political rise. As a result of his attacks at the hands of Trump, Bush's support among Republicans had fallen all the way to 3% by early December. Jeb's campaign largely ignored the Trump's attacks for most of the campaign, likely believing that Trump's campaign would eventually fall apart without Jeb needing to attack him. When Jeb finally began to retort against Trump in January and February 2016, it was too little, too late to save Jeb's campaign. {{cite weblast1=DelRealfirst1=Josetitle=With S.C. approaching, the target on Trump grows larger. =\\"Please Clap\\"= In February 2016, at a town hall event in Hanover, New Hampshire following the Iowa Caucus, Bush's call for the country to elect a strong commander-in-chief was met with silence from the audience; in response, Bush dryly instructed the audience to \\"Please clap.\\" A video clip of the incident went viral and was noted as a symbol of his campaign's sagging popularity. =Suspension of campaign= After a series of poor results in Iowa and New Hampshire, Bush spent his remaining money and campaign effort on the South Carolina primary. He placed fourth with under 8% of the vote. That night, Bush suspended his campaign, ending his presidential bid. In an analysis of what went wrong, POLITICO argues that: > His slow, awkward stumble from August through October encapsulates > everything that caused the operation viewed as \\"Jeb!, Inc.\\" to fail. Bush > was on the wrong side of the most galvanizing issues for Republican primary > voters, he himself was a rusty and maladroit campaigner and his campaign was > riven by internal disagreements and a crippling fear that left them > paralyzed and unable to react to Trump.Eli Stokols, \\"Inside Jeb Bush's $150 > Million Failure His closest aides failed to predict Trump and never changed > course, guiding a flawed candidate into a corner he couldn‚Äôt escape.\\" > February 20, 2016. Fundraising On July 9, 2015, at a campaign fund-raising conference in the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, Bush announced that super PACs which support his candidacy, mainly Right to Rise, had received a total of $103 million during the previous six months. The campaign itself had received $11.4 million, $700,000 a day, during its first two weeks.

She escaped to England from Prague in 1939, aged eleven, on a Kindertransport flight organised by Trevor Chadwick. Having composed her first poem, in German, at the age of four, she continued her education in Dorset and Surrey and began writing poetry in English. She has published several volumes of verse and her poems have appeared in many anthologies. She has been described by Carol Ann Duffy as a fine poet \\"who should be better known.\\" Early life Mayer was born in 1927 in Karlsbad (Karlovy Vary), a spa town in the then German-speaking Sudetenland area of Czechoslovakia. Her father, Arnold Stein, had a small shop in the town selling ladies' coats and dresses, and her mother Erna (n√©e Eisenberger) owned a knitwear business there. Mayer had an elder half-sister Johanna from her mother's previous marriage to Hans Travnicek, a Roman Catholic. The family fled east to Prague in September 1938, shortly before the Nazi annexation of the Sudetenland. The city was already home to many Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria, and Mayer's parents spent the next six months chasing between official offices and consulates in a vain attempt to emigrate. As a last resort, in February 1939 her father made a direct approach to Trevor Chadwick, an Englishman who was organising the Prague end of an operation to rescue children at risk from the Nazis. This rescue operation was part of a wider project set up in October 1938 by Doreen Warriner, with later assistance from the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia (BCRC), aimed initially at helping exiled anti-Nazi Sudeten leaders to escape the country. As the scope of the project expanded to include these leaders' families, the responsibility for evacuating refugee children was taken on by Nicholas Winton who had come to Prague just before Christmas 1938 to help with the rescue. After weeks dealing with various agencies and interviewing candidate families, Winton returned to London to find guarantors for the children and deal with the sluggish British authorities. Before giving any child a permit for entry to Britain the Home Office needed a guarantor, in this case a person or organisation willing to keep and educate the child up to the age of seventeen and pay ¬£50 to cover the cost of their eventual repatriation. This is . Trevor Chadwick had originally gone to Prague to select two boys to be looked after at his family's preparatory school in Swanage, Dorset. Soon after delivering them, however, he decided to return to the city to help with the evacuation of other children. He remained in Prague until June 1939 and organised a number of Kindertransport trains, working in partnership with Winton at the London end. Chadwick found a place for Mayer on a flight to Britain which left Ruzynƒõ Airport on 14 March 1939, one day before German troops marched into Prague. He also arranged for her to be sponsored by his widowed mother and to live, at first, with his own family in Swanage. The dedication in Mayer's 1988 collection A Heartache of Grass is \\"to the memory of Muriel Chadwick and her son Trevor Chadwick to whom I owe my preservation\\". Mayer's father Arnold was sent to the Nisko concentration camp in Poland in 1939. He escaped and made his way to Soviet-occupied Lemberg/Lw√≥w, joining Soviet forces fighting on the Eastern Front. His last letter to his daughter was written in June 1940. Interviewed in 2010 for a Channel 5 (UK) documentary, Mayer describes how her father and a few companions were initially welcomed by the Russians. But she learned after the war that he had subsequently been sent to a Soviet labour camp where she believes he perished.Britain‚Äôs Secret Schindler, produced: Testimony Films, developed: Brightside Films , commissioned: Channel 5 (UK), broadcast: 27 January 2011, Producer/Director Steve Humphries. Her mother Erna was sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in October 1942, and then the following year to Auschwitz where she too died. Mayer's half-sister Johanna was half-Jewish and survived the war, working as a bank clerk in Prague. After the war she suffered from mental illness and was hospitalised in East Germany. Johanna died in 2007. England Upon arrival at Croydon Airport to the south of London, Mayer and another girl, Hanna Stern, left the other refugee children and travelled down to Dorset by car with Hanna's guarantors. Mayer was taken to Chadwick's family home in Swanage where she was welcomed by his wife. Chadwick had remained with the main group and the following day set out again for Prague, which was now under Nazi occupation. A semi-fictionalized account of Mayer's rescue is used for the character Hugo in the children's book War Games by Jenny Koralek, Chadwick's niece. Although Mayer generally had a good relationship with her guarantor, Muriel Chadwick, they were not particularly close and in 1940 she was enrolled at a boarding school in Swanage. Here her native language meant she was wrongly perceived to be German and she was then teased by the other pupils. By 1942 the school was in decline and Mayer left to become a boarder at the Stoatley Rough School in Haslemere, Surrey where she was much happier, describing it as \\"heavenly\\". This co-educational, non-denominational school had been founded in 1934 by German √©migr√© Dr Hilde Lion and Quaker activist Bertha Bracey, to provide an education for mainly Jewish refugee children from Nazi Europe. Three of Mayer's favourite teachers there, Dr Lion (head teacher), Dr Emmy Wolff (German language and literature) and Dr. Luise Leven (music) are celebrated in her poem \\"A Lion, a Wolf and a Fox\\". Mayer finished her schooling at Stoatley Rough in 1944 aged seventeen and joined her guarantor, who by then was living at Stratford-upon-Avon. At the beginning of 1945, Mayer left for hachsharah (preparation for kibbutz life in Palestine), working on farms in Worcestershire and Surrey. But after seventeen months she felt no vocation for life on the land and at the end of May 1946 moved to London to take up office work. She became a naturalised British citizen in 1949 following her marriage to Adolf Mayer in September that year. He too had come to England in 1939 as a refugee, in his case from Vienna. He served in the British Army between 1940 and 1946 and then worked as an office manager. In 1960 he set up his own import business, where Mayer helped with clerical tasks whilst working on her poems. In her thirties Mayer read for a degree at Bedford College, University of London, graduating in 1963 with a BA in English, German and History of Art. Her course included lectures at Birkbeck College given by Nikolaus Pevsner, author of the 46-volume series The Buildings of England. In late 1963 she was employed by him as a part-time research assistant on the Bedfordshire volume but the work (gathering building references from the Victoria County History) was unfulfilling, and to Pevsner's great annoyance she left after a few months to resume her writing.  Poetry  Much of Gerda Mayer's poetry draws on the trauma of her uprooting and loss of family in 1939, but her creativity was apparent many years before that. In fact her first poem was composed when she was just four years old and was recorded by her father in a Babys Tagebuch (German equivalent of \\"Baby Diary\\"), a journal he had kept from her birth until her departure from Prague that year. At school in England her reading was soon on a par with that of her classmates but the poetry took much longer to catch up, as she recalled in 2009: \\"My first English poem, written at the age of twelve was no better than one I had composed (in my pre-literacy days) at the age of four ... and a poem I wrote at the age of sixteen was on a level with one I had written at the age of eleven, just before leaving home.\\" During the 1950s and 1960s Mayer's output increased and in 1975 her first major collection appeared in Treble Poets 2. She continued to have poems published in magazines and anthologies and appeared regularly at poetry readings, on one occasion speaking at the Aldeburgh Festival. Further collections were published including two for children, with many poems written specifically for that audience, and 2013 saw a selection of her poems translated into Norwegian. In 2005 her Prague Winter was published, a short account in prose and poetry of the events leading to Mayer's departure from Prague, and the people she left behind. On BBC radio she has featured in episodes of Poetry Now (1987) and Time For Verse (1990), when Carol Ann Duffy presented poems written and read by Mayer. Mayer's most powerful poems speak of loss and longing, and express a deep sadness. The poet Elaine Feinstein for example observed in a 1996 review that \\"most readers ... will have paused over that poignant poem, 'Make Believe' \\", in which Mayer imagines her father alive again. There is a wistfulness, too, when she writes about the countryside (of both her native and adoptive lands). These poems rarely fall into the trap of self-pity, though Mayer can veer in that direction when writing about the minor disappointments of life. In the poems \\"My Aunt Selfpity\\" and \\"Selfpity Again\\" she first identifies, then renounces, her dependence on that negative emotion to inspire her, though she also fears that without it her poems would be \\"bland and blank\\". The majority of Mayer's poems however are sharp and entertaining observations of familiar human foibles, domestic life and growing old grudgingly. Her wry sense of humour is never far away, and in poems such as \\"The Poetry Reading\\" and \\"Drip Drip or Not Bloody Likely\\" she is quite happy to take aim at the poetry scene and fellow poets. =Style and reception= In some poems, such as \\"Poetry Doesn't Move\\", Mayer doubts her talent, and she is sometimes inclined to agree with her father who once told her despairingly: \\"Nothing will ever become of you.\\" Critical reaction, however, has been far more positive: Works =Collections= * 1970: Oddments, (self-published) * 1972: Gerda Mayer's Library Folder (illustrated by Deirdre Farrell), All In (Nina Steane) * 1973: Poet Tree Centaur: A Walthamstow Group Anthology (edited by Gerda Mayer), Oddments * 1975: Treble Poets 2 (Florence Elon, Daniel Halpern, Gerda Mayer), Chatto & Windus * 1980: Monkey on the Analyst's Couch, Ceolfrith Press (a Poetry Book Society recommendation) * 1985: March Postman, Priapus Press * 1988: A Heartache of Grass, Peterloo Poets * 1995: Time Watching, Hearing Eye * 1999: Bernini's Cat: New and Selected Poems, IRON Press * 2003: Hop Pickers' Holiday, The Happy Dragons Press * 2013: Alle Blad Har Mist Sitt Tre (All the Leaves have Lost their Trees), Nordsjoforlaget (Norwegian translation by Odveig Klyve) =Collections for children= * 1978: The Knockabout Show, Chatto & Windus * 1984: The Candy-Floss Tree (Norman Nicholson, Gerda Mayer, Frank Flynn), Oxford University Press =Autobiography= * 2005: Prague Winter, Hearing Eye  References  Further reading * Mayer, Gerda Prague Winter, Hearing Eye, 2005 * Mayer, Gerda \\"Flight to England\\" Poetry Review 88.4, The Poetry Society, Winter 1998/99 * Chadwick, William The Rescue of the Prague Refugees 1938‚Äì39, Matador, 2010  External links  * Poetry Magazines article including the poem \\"Fragment\\" * New York Times article including the poem \\"Children with Candles\\" * Heartache of Grass publisher's page including the poem \\"Poetry Doesn‚Äôt Move\\" * My Poetry Cafe blog including the poem \\"Shallow Poem\\" * Mayer's poem \\"Owl\\" illustrated by Paul Bommer * Oral history interview with Gerda Mayer in December 1989 (recorded for the book The Uprooted by Dorit B.

Floreen (born September 29, 1951) is an American politician who was a member of the Montgomery County Council in Maryland from 2002 to 2018, serving four terms. She previously served two terms on the Montgomery County Planning Board from 1986 to 1994, was mayor of Garrett Park, Maryland from 2000 to 2002, and ran unsuccessfully as an independent for Montgomery County Executive in 2018. Early years Floreen was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on September 29, 1951. She graduated from Smith College with a bachelor of arts degree in American Studies in 1973. She earned a juris doctorate from Rutgers University School of Law‚ÄìNewark in 1976. In 1983, the Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection allowed Permanent Financial Corporation to build an office building at Wayne and Cedar avenues in downtown Silver Spring that was taller, wider, and closer to the street than county code allowed. Floreen represented a group of nine families living nearby who protested the building's violations. Floreen argued that constructing a building prior to the discovery of zoning violations does not excuse the builder from the compliance, nor does it allow them an automatic zoning variance. The Allied Civic Group, a coalition of county civic associations, awarded Floreen its Thomas B. Cook Award for her work representing the families in the case. The Montgomery County Board of Appeals rejected Permanent Financial Corporation's request for after-the-fact building variances, and the Montgomery County Circuit Court subsequently upheld that decision, ruling that the owner must remove the top two floors of the building and make other modifications to the building to comply with zoning codes. In 1985, the Montgomery County Zoning Board approved construction of a six-story residential building for elders in Silver Spring. The building was to be built on land zoned for single-family homes. Floreen represented the Woodside Civic Association in its appeal of the decision, saying the building would be too dense for the neighborhood, and that the fact that there were already large buildings in nearby downtown Silver Spring was irrelevant. Political career =Montgomery County Planning Board= Floreen became a member of the Montgomery County Planning Board in 1986. The Montgomery County Council appointed her with a vote of 5 to 2, although the Council later moved to officially record the vote as unanimous. Floreen succeeded Mable Granke after her term expired. Floreen said she would give up her part-time law practice to sit on the board in order to avoid any conflict. The board considered a $250 million development plan for downtown Silver Spring in 1988. The plan included retail, office, and hotel space. Floreen was opposed to the plan, saying it was too much too soon, and she was particularly to the proposed three-story bridge over Georgia Avenue. Because members of the Planning Board are limited to two four-year terms, Floreen stepped down from the board in 1994. =Mayor of Garrett Park= Floreen was elected mayor of the town of Garrett Park in 2000. While mayor, she supported a renovation to Penn Place, a 104-year-old Victorian house and one of the oldest buildings in the town. The building's porches were rebuilt, previous alterations were removed, and the building was brought up to building codes, safety standards, and historical preservation requirements. =Montgomery County Council= Floreen ran for an at-large seat on the Montgomery County Council in 2002. Her campaign focused on reducing traffic, building the Intercounty Connector, expanding all-day kindergarten, reducing class sizes, and increasing funding for health and human services. Her candidacy was endorsed by Montgomery County Executive Douglas M. Duncan and the editorial board of the Washington Post. She received enough votes in the Democratic Party primary to advance to the general election, and she won a seat on the Council during the general election. On the subject of transportation, Floreen has supported building the Intercounty Connector, supported building Montrose Parkway, and opposed establishing bus rapid transit between Bethesda and Silver Spring, On development, Floreen supported increases to the recordation and transfer taxes, supported lifting restrictions on the height of buildings in the southern part of the county, supported lifting residential construction bans in the central part of the county, supported strengthening the county's Moderately Priced Dwelling Unit program, supported requiring ten percent of homes built in new developments near Metro stations be set aside for middle-income families, opposed increasing taxes on developers, opposed closing two MARC train stations with low ridership, and opposed reducing the maximum allowable height of a residential house height from 35 feet to 30 feet. On environmental issues, she supported removing trash cans from most county parks and supported increasing the fine for deliberately violating the county's forest conservation law. She also supported banning smoking in restaurants and bars, opposed cutting the Montgomery County Public Libraries' budget, opposed a plan to import lower- cost prescription drugs from Canada for county employees and retirees, and supported a law requiring permits for lawn signs displayed for more than 30 days. Floreen was reelected in 2006, 2010, and 2014. =Montgomery County Executive race= In the 2018 race for Montgomery County Executive, Floreen endorsed Rose Krasnow, who came in third behind businessman David Blair and long-time Montgomery County Council Member Marc Elrich in the Democratic Party primary. Floreen subsequently switched her party affiliation from Democrat to independent (unaffiliated) and filed to enter the race for Montgomery County executive, submitting 20,343 signatures to election officials by the deadline of August 6, 2018. She faced Elrich and Republican Robin Ficker, a local attorney and sports heckler, in the November general election. Floreen positioned herself as a moderate alternative to Elrich and campaigned for support from centrist Republicans, independents, and Democrats dissatisfied with Elrich. On November 6, Floreen was defeated in the general election for County Executive by Marc Elrich, who won the three-way race with 64.4% of the vote. Personal life Floreen lives in Garrett Park, Maryland, with her husband, David O. Stewart. She has three adult children and one grandchild.

Life and career Born in Rome, Valori studied at the Silvio d‚ÄôAmico Academy of Dramatic Arts, graduating in 1948. The same year, she entered the stage company of the Piccolo Teatro of Rome directed by Orazio Costa. After playing in several classics, Valori specialized as a comedic actress, and had her main successes in the musical theatre genre, notably appearing in Rugantino and Aggiungi un posto a tavola. In films, she was a very active character actress, mainly cast in humorous roles. Valori appeared often on television, as a comedian, a presenter and an actress in series and TV-movies of some success. She also had a consistent success on radio, in which she created the character of \\"Sora Bice\\", a shrewish RAI telephone operator. Valori often shared the scene with her husband, the actor and comedian Paolo Panelli, whom she had married in 1952. Their daughter Alessandra is also an actress.

Green and written by George Ade and J. Clarkson Miller. The film stars Thomas Meighan, Lila Lee, Frederick Burton, Cyril Ring, Charles S. Abbe, Florence Dixon, and Gertrude Quinlan. The film was released on December 24, 1922, by Paramount Pictures. Plot As described in a film magazine, when Tom Redding's father dies, it transpires that, instead of being one of the wealthiest citizens of the Town of Bradford, he left little except some debts, having speculated wildly. Tom (Meighan) and his mother (Gordon) are compelled to leave their old home and move into a small house. Even the factory his father owned falls into creditors' hands and Olivia Hornby (Dixon), Tom's sweetheart, discards him. Only Mary Thorne (Lee), his father's former secretary, remains faithful to Tom and his mother. As a last resource, Tom decides to go west to try and develop an oil well that Ton's father had sunk money into. Eventually he strikes oil. He meets his old college chum Billy Andrews (Wheat) who suggests that Tom return to Bradford apparently broke and thus discover who his true friends are. Their plot is developed satisfactory. Billy, posing as the representative of the millionaire Keene, buys up practically all the property in town, including the bank, newspaper, and the factory. Tom, poorly dressed, is coldly received by all save Mary, who even offers her savings to back him in a new venture. Then Billy announces that Keene will be arriving, and the people of the town turn out to welcome him. They are very surprised when the \\"Keene\\" turns out to be the despised Tom Redding. Tom gives a big dinner to his former detractors and, instead of taking revenge, announces that he will allow them to continue in control of his investments save the factory, which again displays the sign \\"Redding and Son.\\" He and Mary are united.

Examples of risk factors include high voltages, high and low pressures and temperatures, corrosive and toxic chemicals and chemical vapours, radiation, fire, explosions, and biohazards including infective organisms and their toxins. Measures to protect against laboratory accidents include safety training and enforcement of laboratory safety policies, safety review of experimental designs, the use of personal protective equipment, and the use of the buddy system for particularly risky operations. In many countries, laboratory work is subject by health and safety legislation. In some cases, laboratory activities can also present environmental health risks, for example, the accidental or deliberate discharge of toxic or infective material from the laboratory into the environment.  Chemical hazards  Hazardous chemicals present physical and/or health threats to workers in clinical, industrial, and academic laboratories. Laboratory chemicals include cancer-causing agents (carcinogens), toxins (e.g., those affecting the liver, kidney, and nervous system), irritants, corrosives, sensitizers, as well as agents that act on the blood system or damage the lungs, skin, eyes, or mucous membranes.  Biological hazards  Biohazard symbol (black and yellow) = Biological agents and biological toxins = Many laboratory workers encounter daily exposure to biological hazards. These hazards are present in various sources throughout the laboratory such as blood and body fluids, culture specimens, body tissue and cadavers, and laboratory animals, as well as other workers. These are federally regulated biological agents (e.g., viruses, bacteria, fungi, and prions) and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety, to animal or plant health, or to animal or plant products. #Anthrax - Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by a spore- forming bacterium called Bacillus anthracis. #Avian Flu - Avian influenza is caused by Influenza A viruses. #Botulism - Cases of botulism are usually associated with consumption of preserved foods. #Foodborne Disease - Foodborne illnesses are caused by viruses, bacteria, parasites, toxins, metals, and prions (microscopic protein particles). Symptoms range from mild gastroenteritis to life-threatening neurologic, hepatic and renal syndromes. #Hantavirus - Hantaviruses are transmitted to humans from the dried droppings, urine, or saliva of mice and rats. #Legionnaires‚Äô Disease - Legionnaires‚Äô disease is a bacterial disease commonly associated with water-based aerosols. #Molds and fungi - Molds and fungi produce and release millions of spores small enough to be air, water, or insect-borne which may have negative effects on human health including, allergic reactions, asthma, and other respiratory problems. #Plague - The World Health Organization reports 1,000 to 3,000 cases of plague every year. A bioterrorist release of plague could result in a rapid spread of the pneumonic form of the disease, which could have devastating consequences. #Ricin - Ricin is one of the most toxic and easily produced plant toxins. It has been used in the past as a bioterrorist weapon and remains a serious threat. #Smallpox - Smallpox is a highly contagious disease unique to humans. It is estimated that no more than 20 percent of the population has any immunity from previous vaccination. #Tularemia - Tularemia is also known as \\"rabbit fever\\" or \\"deer fly fever\\" and is extremely infectious. Relatively few bacteria are required to cause the disease, which is why it is an attractive weapon for use in bioterrorism.  Physical hazards and others  Besides exposure to chemicals and biological agents, laboratory workers can also be exposed to a number of physical hazards. Some of the common physical hazards that they may encounter include the following: ergonomic, ionizing radiation, non-ionizing radiation and noise hazards. = Ergonomic Hazards = Laboratory workers are at risk for repetitive motion injuries during routine laboratory procedures such as pipetting, working at microscopes, operating microtomes, using cell counters and keyboarding at computer workstations. Repetitive motion injuries develop over time and occur when muscles and joints are stressed, tendons are inflamed, nerves are pinched and the flow of blood is restricted. Standing and working in awkward positions in front of laboratory hoods/biological safety cabinets can also present ergonomic problems.Darragh AR, Harrison H, Kenny S. Effect of ergonomics intervention on workstations of microscope workers. American Journal of Occupational Therapy. 2008. 62:61-69. = Ionizing Radiation = Danger radiation zone warning sign Ionizing radiation sources are found in a wide range of occupational settings, including laboratories. These radiation sources can pose a considerable health risk to affected workers if not properly controlled. Any laboratory possessing or using radioactive isotopes must be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and/or by a state agency that has been approved by the NRC, 10 CFR 31.11 and 10 CFR 35.12. The fundamental objectives of radiation protection measures are: 1\\\\. to limit entry of radionuclides into the human body (via ingestion, inhalation, absorption, or through open wounds) to quantities as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) and always within the established limits; 2\\\\. to limit exposure to external radiation to levels that are within established dose limits and as far below these limits as is reasonably achievable.  Safety hazards  = Autoclaves and sterilizers = Workers should be trained to recognize the potential for exposure to burns or cuts that can occur from handling or sorting hot sterilized items or sharp instruments when removing them from autoclaves/sterilizers or from steam lines that service the autoclaves. = Centrifuges = Centrifuges, due to the high speed at which they operate, have great potential for injuring users if not operated properly. Unbalanced centrifuge rotors can result in injury, even death. Sample container breakage can generate aerosols that may be harmful if inhaled. The majority of all centrifuge accidents are the result of user error. = Compressed gases = Compressed gas cylinders.mapp and oxygen.triddle Laboratory standard for compressed gas # Is a gas or mixture of gases in a container having an absolute pressure exceeding 40 pounds per square inch (psi) at 70 ¬∞F (21.1 ¬∞C); or # Is a gas or mixture of gases having an absolute pressure exceeding 104 psi at 130 ¬∞F (54.4 ¬∞C) regardless of the pressure at 70 ¬∞F (21.1 ¬∞C); or # Is a liquid having a vapor pressure exceeding 40 psi at 100 ¬∞F (37.8 ¬∞C) as determined by ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) Within laboratories, compressed gases are usually supplied either through fixed piped gas systems or individual cylinders of gases. Compressed gases can be toxic, flammable, oxidizing, corrosive, or inert. Leakage of any of these gases can be hazardous.  Store, handle, and use compressed gases  *All cylinders whether empty or full must be stored upright. *Secure cylinders of compressed gases. Cylinders should never be dropped or allowed to strike each other with force. *Transport compressed gas cylinders with protective caps in place and do not roll or drag the cylinders. = Cryogens and dry ice = Cryogens, substances used to produce very low temperatures [below -153 ¬∞C (-243 ¬∞F)], such as liquid nitrogen (LN2) which has a boiling point of -196 ¬∞C (-321 ¬∞F), are commonly used in laboratories. Although not a cryogen, solid carbon dioxide or dry ice which converts directly to carbon dioxide gas at -78 ¬∞C (-109 ¬∞F) is also often used in laboratories. Shipments packed with dry ice, samples preserved with liquid nitrogen, and in some cases, techniques that use cryogenic liquids, such as cryogenic grinding of samples, present potential hazards in the laboratory. Hand protection is required to guard against the hazard of touching cold surfaces. It is recommended that Cryogen Safety Gloves be used by the worker. Eye protection is required at all times when working with cryogenic fluids. When pouring a cryogen, working with a wide-mouth Dewar flask or around the exhaust of cold boil-off gas, use of a full face shield is recommended. = Personal protective equipments = Personal protective equipment or PPE are equipments worn to prevent against exposure of hazardous substances. Although, PPE does not eliminate the risks of hazards but it helps protect the user from the exposure. To make a workplace safer, it should provide instructions and training of how to use and choose proper PPE in different situations.Nitrile gloves PPE includes: * Long-sleeved shirts, lab coats, aprons. * goggles * Safety gloves; ** There are 2 common types of safety gloves that are widely used in high school or university laboratory, Latex and Nitrile gloves. Latex gloves have a high sensitivity when it comes to contact and fine control which is very suitable for surgery. On the other hands, Nitrile gloves are the gloves that do not have latex protein which cost twice. It was known as the most durable, resisted to tear and many chemicals. Beside all the benefits, Nitrile gloves also have drawbacks since it can oxidize silver and high reactive metals as these metals can react with sulfur. Therefore, wearer should have an extra care while wearing this type of protective gloves. * Face shield or safety * Particulate respirator * Organic vapor respirator = Electrical = In the laboratory, there is the potential for workers to be exposed to electrical hazards including electric shock, electrocutions, fires and explosions. Damaged electrical cords can lead to possible shocks or electrocutions. A flexible electrical cord may be damaged by door or window edges, by staples and fastenings, by equipment rolling over it, or simply by aging. The potential for possible electrocution or electric shock or contact with electrical hazards can result from a number of factors, including the following: *Faulty electrical equipment/instrumentation or wiring;https://www.lanl.gov/safety/electrical/docs/elec_hazard_awareness_study_guide.pdf *Damaged receptacles and connectors; and *Unsafe work practices. = Fire = 154x154px Fire is the most common serious hazard that one faces in a typical laboratory. While proper procedures and training can minimize the chances of an accidental fire, laboratory workers should still be prepared to deal with a fire emergency should it occur. In dealing with a laboratory fire, all containers of infectious materials should be placed into autoclaves, incubators, refrigerators, or freezers for containment. Small bench-top fires in laboratory spaces are not uncommon. Large laboratory fires are rare. However, the risk of severe injury or death is significant because fuel load and hazard levels in labs are typically very high. Laboratories, especially those using solvents in any quantity, have the potential for flash fires, explosion, rapid spread of fire, and high toxicity of products of combustion (heat, smoke, and flame) Fire blanket =Glassware= * Broken glass is a hazard for a sharps * Correct eye protection should be worn in most experiments involving glassware. * Inserting a glass rod through a stopper can introduce the possibility of a stab wound or sharps injury if the rod breaks. The hands must be protected. * Tubing should be cut from a barbed connection so as not to shatter the connection. A quick disconnect is preferable to a barbed fitting. * Ground glass joints can become a breaking hazard if they freeze. * Broken and other waste glass should be discarded in a separate container specially marked to indicate its contents. * Glassware should always be labeled as to its contents. * Rapid heating (or cooling) may cause uneven thermal expansion putting too much mechanical stress on the surface and cause it to fracture. Fracturing is a concern when people new to laboratory become impatient and heat glassware, especially the larger pieces, too fast. Heating of glassware should be slowed using an insulating material, such as metal foil or wool, or specialized equipment such as heated baths, heating mantles or laboratory grade hot plates to avoid fracturing. * Hot glass looks like cold glass, so a person must be careful to avoid grabbing hot glassware. * Glassware can explode if the exhaust is in any way restricted, so any apparatus should be vented. * Glassware can implode under negative pressure * When connecting joints, it is the responsibility of the person overseeing the experiment to select the correct seal. For example, PTFE tape, bands, and fluoroether-based grease or oils may emit toxic perfluoroisobutylene fumes if the rated temperature limits are exceed.Haiduc, I., \\"Silicone Grease: A Serendipitous Reagent for the Synthesis of Exotic Molecular and Supramolecular Compounds\\", Organometallics 2004, volume 23, pp. 3-8.

He made his debut for Wales during the 1988 tour of New Zealand. At the time, rugby was an amateur game, and Moseley was not given time off by his employer to travel, resulting in him resigning in order to go on the tour. His Five Nations d√©but came in 1989, against Scotland at Murrayfield. The following year, during Wales' opening match of the 1990 Five Nations against France, Moseley was sent off for stamping on French wing Marc Andrieu. Moseley was handed a 32-week ban for the offence, which at the time was the longest ban ever issued. Moseley moved from Pontypool to Newport RFC for the 1990/91 season, making his d√©but on December 29 against Neath RFC. He briefly resumed his Wales career, making four appearances during the 1991 Rugby World Cup. He made 86 appearances for Newport before departing after the 1995/96 season. He spent the 1996/97 season at West Hartlepool RFC. Following this Moseley moved into a player-coach role at Penzance & Newlyn RFC, and later into his nine seasons with the club, a coaching-only role.

Laurence's captor, the Mambava king (Johnson), takes a fairly strong fancy to the white man. Laurence finally gets away, reaches Fort Pero d'Anhaya, and learns of Carol's marriage. He returns home and his sudden appearance so frightens Carol that he believes she no longer loves him. He returns to Africa and the Mambava king, leaving a note for Carol stating that she can now get a divorce based upon desertion grounds. The shock of Laurence's appearance kills David, and Carol goes to Africa to find her husband. After several adventures, she finds him in the Mambava village and she and David reconcile.

In 2012 he screened a film about food labelling and animal welfare to an invited audience in the Palace of Westminster. The film, entitled How was this Animal Kept?, was professionally produced at Hampton Court House School with the help of Mexican film director Alejandro Sesma and the EU labelling project manager at the Farm Animal Welfare Forum, Ffinlo Costain. Cable is a pupil at the school. In June 2014 Cable founded the Humanitarian Water and Food Youth Award, (WAFA Youth) raising awareness of issues relating to poverty and in particular food and water security. He has spoken and appeared on television, radio, at awards ceremonies, and at TEDx. Early campaigns and activism Cable launched the Labelling Matters campaign, organised by Compassion in World Farming, RSPCA, Soil Association and WSPA, which calls for a new law to be introduced in the UK, labelling meat and dairy food more clearly to show how the animals which were used to produce the food had been kept. Cable's campaign film, made in partnership with Compassion in World Farming, The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, World Animal Protection and The Soil Association was titled How was this animal kept? and was premiered in September 2012 at the UK Parliament to MPs and the media. Since its launch, the film has been shown in schools nationwide, and used to teach children about ethical food and farming in the Geography and Citizenship curriculums. After its screening in Parliament, Cable discussed his film in media; he also met with David Heath, the UK Minister for Agriculture. In 2013, Cable supported Bandi Mbubi's campaign for fair trade mobile phones, Congo Calling, Cable came Runner Up in Amnesty International's 'Young Photojournalist of the Year Award', contributing a photo showing his mother using a mobile phone and the text 'Blood Phones: Demand A Fair Trade Mobile Phone'. Cable is a youth ambassador for the anti-poverty charity Tearfund. In May 2013, he travelled to Malawi on behalf of Tearfund and ITV as part of the IF campaign. Whilst there, he met Mapangano, a young boy his own age who suffers from malnutrition. He documented his experiences in Malawi both on ITV and BBC Radio, raising awareness for the IF campaign and urging world leaders to tackle the problem of global hunger. Humanitarian Water and Food Youth Award As a result of his activism, Cable was invited to create a Youth component for the Humanitarian Water and Food Awards, using gamification as a way to encourage young people to take an interest in social activism. Founded in 2008 and based in Copenhagen, The Humanitarian Water and Food Awards promote global best practices in water and food security initiatives. At the 2014 WAFA Awards, held in London on 19 June, Cable launched the Humanitarian Water and Food Youth Award (WAFA Youth). The WAFA Youth Award has its roots in Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs dictum, \\"Be the change you want to see in the world\\". Its goal is to empower young people to be a key part of solving food and water security. Cable has contributed to The Huffington Post and an early version of his film introducing the awards, The World Food Challenge, was shown as part of the International School Meals Day Initiative in front of the World Bank and USAID and was aired during We Day UK, 2013 at Wembley Arena in front of other social activists who spoke on the day including Malala Yousafzai, Al Gore, Richard Branson, and over 10,000 young people. In launching the award, Cable invited young people to participate in activities, lessons and projects to find solutions to feeding everyone in the world and providing safe water. In line with the WAFA Award's approach - based on the view that we already have the resources to sustainably feed our world, but that we need access and the tools to use these resources sustainably - he and the staff of WAFA Youth, in collaboration with the 'Water Explorer' programme created by Global Action Plan, set up WAFA Youth as an online platform for schools. Across 2015 - 2017, at least 100,000 children participated in the programme from 1,400 schools in more twelve countries. The country teams with the best record of highlighting the I - CARE values (Integrity, Commitment, Awareness, Responsibility, Empathy) were entered for the WAFA Youth International Awards. The winners of 2015 were from Wyebank Secondary School, Durban, South Africa and in 2016, the winners were the Water Masters from Convent of Mercy School in Cork, Ireland. Continuing activism On 26 June 2014, Cable gave a TED talk as part of TEDxYouth at Hampton Court House School. His talk, titled ‚Äò‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs missing from our efforts to change the world?‚Äù described his previous campaigning and activism. He went on to raise awareness for the success of FairPhone, the Permaculture Research Institute, and the Green Belt movement to ask questions regarding how we can change our world. He introduced the CARE Revolution. This initiative was fostered and developed by The100Hours, a charitable organisation based in the UK whose aim is to bring 'wise and compassionate living and leadership' into the centre of education; Cable is also a spokesperson and ambassador for The100Hours and in November 2014 was named an #iwill Ambassador for youth social action. In January 2015, along with his parents, educators Paul Vincent Cable and Agnesa Tothova, Cable co-founded a chain of 'changemaker' schools known as EnSo, aimed at children at the bottom of the economic pyramid in Sub-Saharan Africa and India. These schools have adopted in their curriculum a version of the methodology Cable has used in his social activism and social entrepreneurship. From 2016 to 2019, Cable worked with the Diana Award and Royal Foundation‚Äôs Cyberbullying Taskforce. From March 2017 to March 2019 Cable served on the Youth Board of SuperCell, a Finnish mobile game development company, focusing on tackling cyberbullying. Ayrton Cable is the grandson of former UK Secretary of State for Business, Innovation, and Skills and Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable.

Description  When different coloured glazes are applied to a ceramic surface, the glazes have a tendency to run together during the firing process. In the cuerda seca technique, the water-soluble glazes are separated on the surface by thin lines of a greasy substance to prevent them running out of their delineated areas. A dark pigment such as manganese carbonate is usually mixed with the grease to produce a dark line around each coloured area.  History  Although some scholars have postulated an Iranian origin (citing Ummayyad-era examples from Suza), many scholars believe that the cuerda seca technique originated primarily in al-Andalus (Islamic Spain and Portugal) in the second half of the 10th century, during the Umayyad period. The technique was further advanced during the Taifas period in the 11th century. Preserved fragments of tiles from the late 12th-century minaret of the Kasbah Mosque in Marrakesh, Morocco, have been cited as the earliest surviving example of cuerda seca tilework being used for architectural decoration. In central Asia tiles were manufactured using the cuerda seca technique from the second half of the 14th century. The introduction of different coloured glazes is recorded in the mausoleums of the Shah-i-Zinda necropolis in Samarkand. In the 1360s the colours were restricted to white, turquoise and cobalt blue but by 1386 the palette had been expanded to include yellow, light-green and unglazed red. Large quantities of cuerda seca tiles were produced during the Timurid (1370‚Äì1507) and Safavid (1501‚Äì1736) periods. In the 15th century Persian potters from Tabriz introduced the technique into Turkey and were responsible for decorating the Ye≈üil Mosque in Bursa (1419-1424). Within the Ottoman Empire cuerda seca tilework fell out of fashion in the 1550s and new imperial buildings were decorated with underglaze-painted tiles from ƒ∞znik. The last building in Istanbul to include cuerda seca tilework was the Kara Ahmed Pasha Mosque which was designed in 1555 but only completed in 1572.

Sketch by James Montgomery Flagg, 1909 A peach basket hat (sometimes fruit basket hat) is a millinery design that resembles an upturned country basket of the style typically used to collect fruit. Generally it is made of straw or similar material and it often has a trimming of flowers and ribbons. Some models may also feature a veil or draped fabric covering. It was introduced in around 1908 and caused some controversy over the succeeding year due to its extreme dimensions and decorations. It had revivals ‚Äì designs were at this stage more modest ‚Äì in the 1930s and 1950s. History of the design American singer Blossom Seeley in a peach basket style, 1912 The name peach basket hat became popularly used around 1908 in the United States. An advertisement in the Pittsburgh Gazette describes \\"the new Peach Basket Hats\\", also showing an illustration of a flower-decorated straw hat in the shape of a basket. While the term peach basket does not appear to have been used in the British fashion press, descriptions involving fruit baskets were. A 1908 comment piece in The Guardian by Evelyn Sharp described a variety of oversized designs, including one similar to Roundhead headgear, noting that they were: \\"hideously popular\\" and came trimmed with a variety of flower, fruit and bird motifs. Sharp added: \\"A basket of market produce pinned on the head would have much the same effect. For next to the difficulty of finding the head of the wearer underneath the hat of to-day comes the difficulty of finding hat shape under the trimming of to-day\\". A 1907 article in the American edition of Vogue had predicted that the future of hats was: \\"in size colossal\\" and, two years on, the magazine suggested that the growing popularity of photography had inspired many of these new millinery designs, as couturiers were exposed to images from other cultures and countries. The inspiration for the peach basket millinery design was said to be the oversized styles worn by women of the Congo. =Controversy and ridicule= Kay Laurell in an unusual high-crowned and fabric draped variation on the peach basket, c. 1910 Although the peach basket was launched as one of the 1908 season's new looks, it was not greeted with universal acclaim. The Los Angeles Herald, reported in 1909 that the US National Association of Retail Milliners had: \\"launched the aeroplane as the new style of headgear, put a ban on the peach basket hat and decreed the three-cornered hat of the Louis XVI period as the stunning bonnet for the coming winter months\\". The milliners, who declared the peach basket (or fruit basket) dead, had suffered a poor season of sales. The association's president admitted: \\"The last season proved disastrous, short and unprofitable owing to the launching of extreme styles such as the fruit basket hat...a concerted effort has been made to tone down all attempts to introduce freak creations\\". A further editorial in a New York newspaper said that husbands were partly responsible for the collapse in sales of the peach basket hat, with the manager of one Sea Cliff store reporting: \\"I have had no end of husbands come to the shop this spring in company with their wives to pick out their hats to prevent them from investing in a peach basket, washbasin or inverted bowl shape. Never before has so much fun been poked at millinery as this season\\". In its favour, the peach basket was said to have saved a New York showgirl from disfigurement. Beginning: \\"Here's a kind word at last for the peach basket hat\\", an article in the Los Angeles Herald went on to describe how a car passenger thrown head first through a car windshield was saved because her substantial peach basket hat exited before her, thereby saving her from skinning her nose. =In popular culture= In 1909, the short comedy film Flossie's New Peach Basket Hat, produced by Sigmund Lubin, was released. In the same year, the song In a Peach Basket Hat Made for Two was composed by James M. Reilly and Henry W. Petrie. Later revivals Marion Davies in a peach-basket style design, unknown date The design had a brief revival in the 1930s, with a fashion commentator noting that: \\"as fetching a line as ever it was in pre-war days, the peach-basket hat returned this week to offer lively competition to the flat-crowned hats as spring's favorite millinery\\". The article went on to describe a modified design of rough purple straw with a band of grosgrain ribbon and a bouquet of violets, as well as a classic peach basket with a navy straw brim and a tall tapering crown of leghorn straw dressed with flowers and a short veil. It was also a design that featured in the mid 1950s, usually in a simplified form but sometimes the straw frame was draped with soft fabric. Although the term ‚Äì and the classic peach-basket design ‚Äì have not been widely seen since the 1950s, Princess Maria Laura of Belgium wore an organza hat described as a peach basket at the 2003 wedding of Prince Laurent of Belgium and Claire Coombs.

First described as Formica floridana by Buckley in 1866, the species was moved to Camponotus by Mayr in 1886. The ant is widespread in Florida and occurs as far north as North Carolina and as far west as Mississippi.  Description  Camponotus floridanus is one of the most familiar ant species in Florida owing both to its large size and conspicuous coloration. Workers and queens are bicolored, having a reddish-orange head and a bright to dullish orange colored mesosoma and legs, punctuated sharply by a deep black gaster. Male alates of this species are more concolorous, primarily ranging in the rusty to cider oranges. C. floridanus can be distinguished from its visually similar but smaller relative Camponotus tortuganus by its wider than long head, smaller but stockier legs relative to body size and overall stouter build. Queens on average vary 14-16 mm in length, and the highly polymorphic workers can potentially attain similar lengths, with the largest majors reaching 11-13 mm. Minors and mediae are typically around 4-9 mm. Biology = Behavior = left These ants are highly aggressive and fast moving, being quick to swarm any disturbance to their nest. Workers are relentless as they attack, meticulously checking for weaknesses in the skin and targeting vulnerable areas such as the skin creases or the nail cuticles. Major workers can deliver particularly devastating bites as their mandibles more readily pierce the skin, for which they may then spray noxious formic acid onto. The unusual aggression of this Camponotus species may be an adaptation in response to its nesting habits, as they commonly inhabit extensively rotted deadwood that can easily be broken apart by hand. Outside of deadwood, colonies may be found nesting underground within the base of a living tree or inside tree cavities. Even artificial structures such as hollow poles or fencing may be taken residence. Colonies prefer shaded areas in which to nest, such as in dense woodlands, though any area with many trees which provide adequate shade is potential suitable habitat. Floridanus is readily tolerant of disturbed areas of human habitation, making them a common sight in the densely populated suburbs of Florida. In certain areas these ants can be quite populous and during mating flights the winged individuals numerous, leading to concerned property owners finding them on the walls of stores, buildings and homes. These ants however are not generally considered a threat to structures as they do not normally excavate into wood unlike some wood- boring species of Camponotus, preferring existing cavities to nest in. Floridanus primarily forages at night, though workers from larger colonies may be seen foraging during the day (in shaded areas). Different worker castes also perform different roles in the colony, with the smaller workers caring for the brood and queen, maintaining the nest and foraging for food. Major workers however only defend the nest and do not venture far, unless travelling to and from the numerous satellite nests the colony occupies. Northern populations undergo a diapause during the winter, while southernmost populations do not experience much dramatic and extensive diapause periods, if not at all, due to the warm tropical climate of South Florida. Compared to other members of its genus, C. floridanus is one of the most active and faster growing Camponotus species in North America. = Reproduction = Nuptial flights begin around May and peak in the summer months. Flights are triggered after heavy rains have raised the humidity of the air to 80-90% and temperatures around 80+¬∞F are present half an hour after sunset. The female alates mate in the air once then ground themselves to search for a location to establish a new colony. Floridanus is highly productive and colonies grow rapidly, reaching 1,000 workers within the first year and potentially exceeding 8,000 individuals in a mature colony 2-3 years later. Both male and female alates are attracted to bright white lights and can be found en masse around street, court, and field lights. Queens are fully claustral and colonies are monogynous (contain one queen). = Diet = The Florida carpenter ant is omnivorous, taking arthropod food items as well as sweets, such as nectar or the sugary secretions produced by aphids in which they care for and defend. Like other Camponotus, they have their own species of symbiotic bacteria in the genus Blochmannia that helps supplement their nutrient poor diets. These bacteria recycle waste products, such as urates from animal urine, into usable amino acids for the ants.  Taxonomic status  C. floridanus is closely related to Camponotus atriceps, and may possibly be considered a subspecies of C.atriceps that diverged after a population became isolated within Florida. More phylogenetic and biochemical analysis is needed to determine the evolutionary history between C. floridanus and C. atriceps and in order ascertain the formers status as a separate species or a subspecies.

Between 1953 and 1958 he served as his country's ambassador to Czechoslovakia. Bernard Koenen giving a speech, in a city square on Halle, to celebrate the birth of the German Democratic Republic on 8 October Life =Early years= Koenen was born in Hamburg, the son of a carpenter-joiner and of a cook. His father was a Socialist activist who participated in the founding of the Second International in Paris five months after the boy's birth. By the beginning of the twentieth century his father was a leading member of the Social Democratic Party. On 17 January 1906 they were among an estimated 80,000 people in Hamburg to take part in Germany's first ever mass- political protest march. The protestors' target was an electoral system which privileged the ruling classes at the expense of the working classes, and among those taking part, Bernard Koenen was distributing leaflets. On leaving school Koenen had embarked on an apprenticeship as a Machinist-Fitter and in 1906 joined the German Metal Workers' Union. The next year he became 18 and joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD). His skills evidently made him readily employable and a period of travelling followed, taking in Lausanne, Brussels, Lille and Tunis where, in Bizerta, he was among those who founded the Socialist Party in Tunisia. He undertook his military service between 1910 and 1912 and then returned to working abroad in industry. He was called up into the army in 1914, but released from military service in 1916 on account of \\"anti-military activities\\". By 1917 he had relocated to Leuna in Saxony-Anhalt where he was working an electrician. In 1917 he joined the break-away Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) which had split primarily on account of the mainstream SPD's continuing support for the war (though the USPD proved to be more left-wing on a range of issues in the months ahead). During the November Revolution Koenen was deputy leader of the Workers' Council at the Leuna Chemicals Plant where he was by then working. =Weimar Germany= Bernard Koenen joined the recently formed German Communist Party in 1920 and became a member of the party leadership team for Halle-Merseburg. In 1923 he joined the party's national leadership team. From 1922 till 1933 he also sat as a member of the regional legislative assembly (Landtag) for Saxony. Factionalism continued to be a feature of left-wing politics during the 1920s, and from the middle of the decade Koenen was identified with the so-called Conciliator faction (Vers√∂hnler), which led in 1929 to his being relieved of some of his party offices by the party leader, Ernst Th√§lmann. =Nazi Germany= In January 1933 the NSDAP (Nazi Party) took power and set about establishing one-party government in Germany. Leading members of the Communist party were particular targets. On 12 February 1933, during the course of the Eisleben \\"Bloody Sunday\\" Nazi propaganda march several Communist leaders were killed: Koenen was merely assaulted and badly injured by S.A. members, as a result of which he lost an eye. For the next few months, with a warrant issued for his capture, he was concealed in a private clinic by a doctor who was sympathetic to the Communist cause. =Exile= In May 1933, along with several other fugitive Comminists, he managed to get to the Saarland which was the only part of Germany still under foreign military occupation following the end of the First World War. In July 1933 Bernard Koenin emigrated to the Soviet Union where he would remain till 1945. Initially he worked as the Organisation Secretary of the International Red Aid organisation. Then, in 1937, he was caught up in one of Stalin's purges and detained by the NKVD till 1939. However, in 1940 he was again trusted, by the Communist Party, to undertake assignments. Between 1941 and 1943 he was working for the \\"Deutschen Volkssender\\" (\\"German People's Radio\\") radio station, transferring in August 1943 to Radio \\"Freies Deutschland\\" (\\"Free Germany\\"). He started to work for the Soviet sponsored National Committee for a Free Germany in 1943, which was also the year in which he joined the Central Committee of the (exiled German) Communist Party. =Home to the Soviet occupation zone and the German Democratic Republic= Bernard Koenen returned in 1945 to the Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany. In April 1946 he became a founder member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands). The creation of the party came about through a contentious merger in the area under Soviet Administration of the old Communist Party and the more moderately left-wing Social Democratic Party. The merger was in theory one of equals, but by the time the German Democratic Republic was formally founded in 1949 it was noteworthy that the positions of party influence and leadership were almost all held by men who, like Koenen, had been members of the Communist Party until 1946. With right wing policies discredited by twelve disastrous years of Nazi government, the de facto neutralising of the moderate left created the basis for a return to one-party government, but this time the template had been prepared, in some detail, in Moscow. During the later 1940s Koenen worked as a party officer in the Halle region. Between 1946 and 1952 he was also a member and leader of the SED group in the regional legislature of Saxony-Anhalt. At a national level Koenen was a member of the Party Central Committee from 1946 till his death in 1964. Under the Soviet system, on which the new country's constitutional arrangements were modelled, the responsibilities of government ministers were restricted to implementing the decisions of the Party Central Committee, while a Single List voting system ensured that the National Legislative Assembly (Volkskammer) was also controlled by the ruling SED (controlled by its Central Committee). In terms of power and influence Koenen's Central Committee membership was therefore of greater significance than membership of regional or national legislatures, though in practice there were plenty of Central Committee members who simultaneously held office in national or regional legislatures and/or as government ministers. Koenen himself combined Central Committee membership with membership of the national legislature (Volkskammer), although it was reported that he had declined ministerial office in order to avoid having to cut back on party duties. From 1946 till 1964 Koenen also held a seat in the National Legislative Assembly. However, in 1952 he lost his seat and leadership position in the regional legislature of Saxony-Anhalt when regional legislatures were abolished in the context of a wider programme of regional government reform. Partly as a consequence of those reforms, local and municipal councils became more important. Between 1952 and 1953, and again, in succession to Franz Bruk, from 1958 till 1963 Bernard Koenen served as First Secretary to the SED Regional Leadeership (Berzirksleitung) in the city of Halle. In 1953 Koenen was appointed as his country's ambassador to neighbouring Czechoslovakia, an important diplomatic role in which he succeeded Fritz Gro√üe: he held the Prague job till 1958. Between 1960 and 1964 he was a member of the State Council of East Germany.Hermann Weber: Die Wandlung des deutschen Kommunismus, Bd. 2; p. 186f Beyond his political offices, Bernard Koenen worked at teaching and journalism. Family matters Bernard Koenen's elder brother, Wilhelm Koenen (1886-1963), was also a German Communist politician. Bernard Koenen married Frieda Bockentien (1890-1968) during the First World War. Their sons Victor and Alfred both joined the Soviet Red army in order to be part of the fight against Nazi Germany. Viktor Koenen (1920-1942) was killed over or in Poland in 1942. (There are conflicting reports as to how he died.) Alfred Koenen (1921-1995) survived the war, however, and had a career as an army officer and, later, as a diplomat.

Heinz Drewes (1903‚Äì1980) was a German conductor and in 1937‚Äì1944 head of division X (music) of Reichsministerium f√ºr Volksaufkl√§rung und Propaganda at the time when Reichsmusikkammer was led by Peter Raabe from 1935 onwards. He was one of the most influential people in German music world at that time. Drewes was head of division X (music) subordinated divisions: Reich Music Examination Office, Reichsstelle f√ºr Musikbearbeitungen, Auslandsstelle f√ºr Musik, Amt f√ºr Konzertwesen. Career Drewes and Raabe struggled on \\"the leadership in music,\\" and this made Joseph Goebbels happy as he could use their words as a threat to one or the other. Drewes worked in Deutsches Nationaltheater und Staatskapelle Weimar as a r√©p√©titeur and conductor. In 1930 he went in Landestheater in Altenburg (Theater & Philharmonie Th√ºringen) as a conductor. He started there a local chapter for KfdK (Kampfbund f√ºr deutsche Kultur) and the same year he went in NSDAP and wrote articles in NS-Zeitung and V√∂lkischer Beobachter. Deutscher Musiker-Kalender tells in 1943 he was Generalintendant and Generalmusikdirektor. Deutscher Musiker-Kalender 1943 Denazified Drewes worked after the war in N√ºrnberg Conservatory. Later a story emerged that Drewes used pseudonyms as he conducted when working in the propaganda ministry. He conducted only with the radio orchestras. It was he who hired and fired the conductors. He may have used the name Hermann Desser when he conducted Felix Draeseke's Symphonia Tragica with Berlin Symphony Orchestra, published in 1955 by Urania Records. Alan Krueck says there is no such conductor as Hermann Desser, and the music was typical for the Third Reich and on the other hand the quality of the recording was consistent with that achievable at the time. Later Christoph Schl√ºren also identifies Drewes. Drewes appreciated Jean Sibelius and was the president of the German Sibelius Society (Deutsche Sibelius Gesellschaft). He wrote a preface to Ernst Tanzberger's dissertation Die symphonischen Dichtungen, von Jean Sibelius, eine inhalts- und formanalytische Studie (K. Triltsch, 1943). Tommi M√§kel√§ writes in his Sibelius biography that it was explicitly meant to be a greeting 'to our Finnish friends and comrades-in-arm.' Drewes himself writes that the symphonic sagas of Sibelius evidence that \\"while the Finnish Volk could be counted racially among the Finno-Ugric tribe,\\" over centuries it had \\"turned happily toward the German world\\". Drewes was a friend of Richard Strauss, who asked him extend his protection to Strauss' libretist Joseph Gregor. Strauss again asked protection in 1939 to his non-Aryan daughter-in-law and grandchildren. The Swedish composer Kurt Atterberg was worried about the German conductor Helmuth Thierfelder whether he could conduct Attenberg's compositions, and about his possibilities to visit Sweden. The concertmaster of Philharmonischen Orchester Landestheater Coburg Ralph Braun says the significance of Drewes has not been known until today.

He is the David Mulvane Ehrsam and Edward Curtis Franklin Professor of Chemistry at Stanford University. Education and academic career He attended the University of California, Berkeley for both undergraduate and graduate school. He received his Ph.D. in Chemistry in 1974 under the supervision of Professor Charles B. Harris. Fayer began his academic career at Stanford University as an Assistant Professor in 1974.Michael Fayer Curriculum Vitae Research Fayer pioneered and launched a fundamental transformation of how the dynamics and dynamical interactions of complex molecular systems are investigated. The multiple experimental approaches he initiated have forever changed the manner in which chemists, biologist, molecular physicists, and materials scientist interrogate key aspects of nature. By the early 1970s, just as Fayer was beginning his career, advances in laser technology were occurring to make pulses of light that were short enough to get to the time scales of molecular motions. While Fayer contributed to laser development, his real ground breaking contributions are in the methods that we use to look at molecular motions. Even with ultrashort pulses of light, it is still not possible to look, in the normal sense of the word, at molecules moving. Fayer developed and continues to develop and apply what are called ultrafast nonlinear optical experiments to the study of molecular dynamics in complex molecular systems such as liquids, glasses, crystals, and biological systems. Ultrafast nonlinear methods involve sequences of light pulses. In a typical experiment, three pulses of light impinge on a sample, and remarkably, the nonlinear interactions in the sample give rise to a fourth pulse of light that leaves the sample in a unique direction. If the experiments are conducted with visible light, you can actually see this nonlinear production of an additional light pulse. Three beams of ultrashort light pulses go into the sample, but four beams of light come out of the sample. It is this fourth beam of light that contains the information about the sample. There are many versions of this type of experiment that Fayer developed and applied to understanding molecular materials. Depending on the timing of the pulses, the colors of the pulses, and the directions of the pulses coming into the sample, different properties can be investigated. Fayer drove the field of ultrafast optical spectroscopy through his developments and use of these new methods to explicate the properties of complex molecular systems. Fayer's contributions are a play with two acts. In the first act, approximately 1974 through 1993, Fayer's ultrafast nonlinear experiments were conducted using visible or ultraviolet light. These were the colors that were available with the laser technology of the time. In the early 1990s, Fayer realized that a great leap could be taken if the experiments could be extended to the infrared regions of the optical spectrum. Infrared light acts on molecular vibrations, which are the motions of the atoms that make up molecules. By using infrared light, it is possible to more directly interrogate the structural dynamics of molecular systems than with the use of visible or ultraviolet light. However, a source of ultrashort infrared light pulses was necessary, so Fayer got together with Stanford physicists to use a physics experiment, the free electron laser, and turn it to the study of molecular process using ultrafast infrared nonlinear experiments. These first experiments using the free electron laser, which was two football fields long and took a crew to run, set off an explosion of interest in infrared nonlinear methods. In less than ten years, it became possible to perform the experiments using lasers that could be housed in a normal laboratory and did not require a free electron laser. Fayer contributed substantially to the equipment side, but his main creative impact was exploiting the new ultrafast infrared methods and technology for a wide variety of fundamentally important molecular problems. These methods have evolved into what are now called ultrafast multi-dimensional infrared spectroscopy. The methods that Fayer popularized are now spread throughout the world. Honors and awards Fayer was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1999 and the National Academy of Sciences in 2007. A 1982 recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship, Fayer has been honored with several awards from American Physical Society including the 2000 Earle K. Plyler Prize for Molecular Spectroscopy ‚ÄúFor the development of optical and infrared ultrafast spectroscopic methods, and especially for experiments using these methods to measure dynamical processes in condensed phase systems.‚Äù and the 2012 Arthur L. Schawlow Prize in Laser Science ‚ÄúFor seminal contributions to laser science in the development of ultrafast nonlinear and multidimensional vibrational spectroscopy.‚Äù Fayer is the recipient of the 2007 E.

He has written two books on quantum theory, one for teaching at the graduate level and one for laymen. His graduate quantum mechanics book, Elements of Quantum Mechanics, Oxford University Press, 2000, is an advance introduction to quantum theory. Fayer‚Äôs book, Absolutely Small ‚Äì How Quantum Theory Explains Our Everyday World, AMACOM, 2010, is a rigorous introduction to the concepts of quantum mechanics and its application to the molecular and atomic systems that are all around us, but with no math. The book is popular among non-scientists who are interested in science as well as scientists who are not in the field of molecular physics and want a conceptual understanding of quantum theory without getting bogged down with countless equations. Personal life Fayer has been married to Terry Fayer for well over forty years, and he has two children, Victoria and William.

History The inter partes review procedure was enacted on September 16, 2012 as part of the America Invents Act. It replaced a previous review procedure called inter partes reexamination, which in turn stemmed from ex parte reexamination proceedings. Under the ex parte system, any person at any time could challenge the validity of a patent on the basis that its claims were already obvious or unoriginal based on prior art. Under post-2012 inter partes review, petitioners must demonstrate a \\"reasonable likelihood that\\" the party challenging the patent at issue \\"would prevail\\" in the dispute, rather than requiring that it demonstrate a \\"substantial new question of patentability.\\" Process An inter partes review is used to challenge the patentability of one or more claims in a U.S. patent only on a ground that could be raised under 35 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 102 or 103, and only on the basis of prior art consisting of patents or printed publications. The procedure is conducted by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). Whereas patent validity used to require a jury trial within the District Courts, the inter partes review process allows the PTAB to hold a hearing with the respective parties and make its decision from that. Appeals to a PTAB's decision are heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. This process is designed to reduce the costs and time of litigating patents; a jury trial may require millions of dollars to be spent by parties, while an inter partes review can cost only hundreds of thousands of dollars or less in some cases. One may still issue a patent challenge in a District Court, rather than request an inter partes review. As of mid-2017, over a thousand patents have been cancelled as a result of the inter partes review process, and there were more inter partes review cases heard through mid-2017 compared to any individual circuit court. Commentary and legal challenges The adoption of the inter partes review has had mixed reactions from American companies. Large technology firms, like Apple, Google, Intel, and Amazon.com, support the system and have used the inter partes review process to challenge uncertain patents held by those who they perceive to be patent trolls and to fend off challenges to their own patents from other firms. For example, Apple had sought an inter partes review of patents owned by VirnetX; VirnetX had taken Apple to court over patent violations which found in favor for VirnetX and Apple fined over across several cases. Should Apple succeed in its inter partes review, it would be able to nullify the decision of this patent infringement suits. Other industries, particularly in the biomedical and pharmaceutical arenas, are critical of the inter partes review as it allows their rivals to easily challenge their patents, which generally represent the culmination of large amounts of research and development time and costs. One well-reported case of this was Kyle Bass, who manages the Coalition for Affordable Drugs (CFAD). Bass challenged the validity of 28 pharmaceutical corporations' patents through the inter partes review process, claiming that he wanted to invalidate weak patents imposing costs on consumers, thus making drugs covered by those patents more affordable.Andrew Ward, Kyle Bass Plans Legal Action on Pharma Patents, FIN. TIMES (Jan. 7, 2015, 7:44 PM), http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a2a706a0-969c-11e4-922f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3hUceI91O. The drug companies targeted by Bass allege that the sole purpose of the validity challenges was to allow Bass to short the market and thus profit from the change in companies' stock prices.Susan Decker, Drugmakers Strike Back: Bass Blasted Over Patent Challenge, BLOOMBERGBUSINESS (July 30, 2015, 12:15 PM), https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-29/drugmakers-strike- back-kyle-bass-blasted-over-patent-challenges. However, at least one event study indicates that if Bass had in fact pursued such a strategy, he could not have profited, because his \\"petitions for inter partes review ... did not consistently produce statistically significant negative returns in the patent holders' share prices.\\"J. Gregory Sidak, Attack of the Shorting Bass: Does the Inter Partes Review Process Enable Petitioners to Earn Abnormal Returns, 63 UCLA L. Rev. Disc. 120, 150 (2015), https://www.criterioneconomics.com/kyle- bass-inter-partes-reviews-of-patent-validity.html. Randall Rader, a former Chief Judge on the Federal Appeals Court, criticized the inter partes review process, as the small number of administrative judges on the PTAB would be \\"acting as death squads, killing property rights\\". The \\"patent death squad\\" term has since been used frequently as reference to the PTAB by those critical of the inter partes review. Opponents of the inter partes review have sought both changes in legislation through the United States Congress, as well as seeking case ruling. = Sovereign immunity = The Patent Trial and Appeal Board ruled in 2017 that patents of the University of Florida could not be challenged because it had sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution as part of the government of Florida.Sovereign Immunity Excuses University of Florida from IPR ChallengePartnership Between Drug Giant And Native American Tribe May Affect Patent Challenges Some patent law firms then began advising patent holders to sell them to and lease back from native American tribes which have tribal sovereignty. In 2018, a federal appeals court ruled that tribal sovereignty did not protect these patents from challenge, as the PTO was simply reconsidering its previous actions.Native Tribes Can't Shield Patents From USPTO Review = Cuozzo Speed Tech v. Lee (2016) = In 2016, the Supreme Court ruled in Cuozzo Speed Tech v. Lee that the patent agency was within the scope of the law to issue regulations that construe claims in an issued patent according to their \\"broadest reasonable interpretation,\\" rather than on a more restrictive reading based on their \\"plain and ordinary meaning,\\" as is the custom in courts.http://patentlyo.com/patent/2016/01/certiorari-challenge- proceedings.html. This determination was grounded in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., which set forth the legal test for determining whether to grant deference to a government agency's interpretation of a statute which it administers when the text is ambiguous. They additionally opined that the standard was in line with the public purpose of patent law, since construing a patent claim according to its broadest reasonable construction helps to protect the public by increasing the likelihood that a patent examiner will deny a patent claim on the basis that it is too broad, thereby encouraging applicants to draft their claims narrowly and preventing patents \\"from tying up too much knowledge, while helping members of the public draw useful information from the disclosed invention and better understand the lawful limits of the claim.\\" The decision also affirmed that the PTAB's decision to grant an IPR proceeding is not appealable to the Federal courts, as the text of ¬ß314(d) of the statute expressly states that such decisions \\"shall be final and nonappealable.\\" = Oil States v. Greene's Energy (2018) = In April 2018, the Supreme Court ruled in Oil States Energy Services, LLC v. Greene's Energy Group, LLC that validated the constitutionality of the inter partes review. The legal question asked to the Court was whether Congress violated the Constitution (specifically, either Article III or the Seventh Amendment) by giving the PTAB judicial powers through the inter partes review that otherwise belong to the judicial system. In the 7‚Äì2 decision, the Court found that the granting of patents is considered a public right, and Congress has the authority to grant the Patent Office the ability to reconsider their grants as being a public right. = SAS Institute Inc. v. Iancu (2018) = At the same time as the Oil States ruling, the Supreme Court ruled in SAS Institute Inc. v. Iancu that the PTAB must include a decision on each claim that is challenged within an inter partes review, even if only a portion of those claims are reviewed during proceedings. By having the PTAB decide on each challenged claim, those claims cannot be re-challenged in another case, outside of appeals of the PTAB review.

It is spring) and Huron-Wendat Nation (three women are growing food, two men give them shell necklaces and surrounding them is a wheat field. It is summer). Each ancestral nation was set on one of the four islands, which symbolizes the four directions. The stadium represented a womb, where tradition says indigenous people learn drumming from their mother's heartbeats. These drumbeats announce the arrival of the eagle. =The Countdown= The eagle must take human form to impart its vision. The metamorphosis is completed in a precipitous plunge from the heavens, and the Messenger stands ready to channel the mystical conversion of dreams into reality. This scene symbolized the arrival of a character known as \\"The Messenger\\", and each countdown number had a meaning. Each number was highlighted by fireworks on the islands, with numbers between 2 and 0 being from the bridge. * 9 is a fetus * 8 is the symbol for infinity * 7 stands for the 7 days of the week * 6 represents the 6 Canadian time zones * 5 refers to the Canadian 5 cent coin (nickel) * 4 is for the four seasons * 3 shows the steps on the Pan Am Games podium * 2 is the peace sign * 1 and 0 refer to the Messenger. =PowWow! Carnival= This was a dance segment reflecting Toronto's multiculturalism and the aboriginal peoples of the Golden Horseshoe region, set to music by DJ Shub (formerly of electronic music group A Tribe Called Red). and also included 183 dancers representing various cultures (such as Hawaii, Brazil, Ukraine, Madagascar and Thailand among others) and 21 dance groups. =The Vision= In a pre-recorded segment, the Pan-American Games Torch was relayed to the stadium through Toronto neighbourhoods by Canada's gold-medal winning 4 √ó 100 m relay team from the 1996 Summer Olympics, culminating with a scene depicting Bruny Surin passing the flame to Donovan Bailey on the CN Tower's EdgeWalk, and then parachuting onto the stadium roof. Bailey was then lowered into the stadium with the torch, and passed it to future athlete, diver Faith Zacharias, who placed the torch on a stand to serve as a focal point for the remainder of the ceremony. The dance groups then broke out into the dance again and exited the stage as one. Following this the president of the Pan American Sports Organization, Julio Maglione and Governor General David Johnston were introduced and entered the box of honour officially. =Raising of the Canadian flag & playing of the national anthem= The Canadian flag was carried by members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The Canadian national anthem \\"O Canada\\" was performed by V√©ronic DiCaire and Chilly Gonzales, accompanied by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra (nearly 80 musicians). They were directed by Peter Oundjian. =Parade of nations= As each nation entered, the music reflected the traditional instruments and melodic styles of each of the forty-one countries and territories. Silhouettes portraying the five disciplines of the pentathlon appear in the distance to honour their entrance (javelin, long jump, wrestling, discus and running), where the first multi sport games and the Pan American Games grew from their foundations. Each nation was preceded by a placard bearer holding a high-tech LED Device which flashed the name of each participating team in the three languages (English, French and Spanish). =Entrance of the Heralds= Sixteen acrobats and one hundred athlete marshals took part in this segment. This segment paid homage to the history of Canada's communication. The heralds represent our continued search for new ways to breach our communication divide. The ear, mouth and nose logos worn by them are all about the technology that helped build Canada at a time when the population was small and obstacles were huge. They invited the crowd to cheer for the volunteers and staff involved in the organization of the games while parading under the United We Play! banner (the official games motto. It was also written in French (Jouons Unis!) and Spanish (¬°Unidos Jugamos!)). They light up LED lights on the athletes shoulders. These lights were designed to make them a part of the show using technology called PixMob. =The Birth of the Twin Fires= The Messenger returns to the stage and reveals the Twin Fires that the Pan American Games flame shelters: The Fire of Dreams and the Fire of Reality. Together they represented the hopes and achievements of each human and every career in sport: trials and achievement, disappointments and progress, failures and victories. We are then taken into other worlds where mysteries await in pristine woods and the blaze of flames. The Messenger transforms the symbols of pentathlon into five powerful guardians for each discipline. The creation of Twin Fires is essential as it symbolized the window that opens between dreams and reality for the duration of this opening ceremony show. =Forest Borealis= One hundred fifty children and youth were selected to perform during this segment after auditions. Six aerial performers flying up to high were also included in this segment. The Messenger created a primordial forest, which represents Canada. In this homage to what will eventually become Canada, four local animals (bear, caribou, woodpecker and owl), guided these one hundred fifty children along the trails of discovery, under the glow of the Aurora Borealis. Thirty-one young ballet dancers (from Canada's National Ballet School) later emerge from the group of children and perform down the stage. =The Fireline= Fifty-three hip hop dancers, eight tumblers (who jumped over the fire onto mats), one aerial clay juggler, two fire manipulators, and one ballet dancer (javelin) took part in this segment. The fireline used in this segment was long. With childhood over the Guardian of the Javelin creates a border. The age of innocence is now over and now the first test in left: overcoming obstacles. To resolve their differences, they turn to lacrosse, Canada's national sport and the traditional Indigenous people's peacemaker. Eventually the fire is extinguished by a water bomber (a Canadian invention). =Waves= This segment sees the heralds from earlier paying their respects to Canadian Broadcasting pioneer Reginald Fessenden. Using radio waves and a jukebox a melody of Canadian love songs are played to the crowd along with two other songs (a famous song of Cirque du Soleil and the official song of the Games). *Love Will Save the Day ‚Äì David Usher *S'il suffisait d'aimer ‚Äì Celine Dion *I Will Remember You ‚Äì Sarah McLachlan *Alegr√≠a ‚Äì Cirque du Soleil *L'Aveu ‚Äì Garou *Together We Are One ‚Äì Serena Ryder (Official song of Toronto 2015 Pan Am Games) =Hearts of bloom= This segment saw 40 dancers and 7 aerialists. This segment represented the changing season, and the Guardian of the Long Jump performs aerial contortions up to 40 feet in the air. This segment represents the biggest leap in adolescent life, the discovery of love. A diameter mountain made of fabric panels to look like snow that melts into sprint (to represent the changing seasons). Suddenly three straps are released and out of nowhere appeared three pairs (a man and woman, two men and two women) to represent the diversity of recognized forms of love in Canada. The dancers were from the Toronto Dance Theatre and Canada's National Ballet School. =Storm of Possibilities= 15 dancers, 6 acrobats (who perform on 30 feet high ladders), 1 hand balancer and the Guardian of wrestling (who is a capoeira dancer and acrobat) were in this segment. This segment represents the doubt humans face in life. The Guardian leads young adults into his own inner struggle. They drew on the courage and find the self-confidence to make the right choice as the sky is raining professions (costumes of a range of opportunities in Canada rain down) and exposing a world of opportunities. Canadian choreographer Christopher House directed the dance portion of this segment. =Train for life= The train represented the railroad that stretches Canada and touches all territories and people (and uniting them). This is the moment when young adults leave home to forge their own paths. The Heralds build the station of farewells and track to our dreams. The railway also represents the journey of all athletes who left home that led them to the ceremony. The railway was built using the ladders from the previous segment. A train appears and the dancers run to jump abroad. =Trailblazing= This segment features the guardian of the discus (who is a freestyle frisbee champion), 3 aerial bungee artists, 19 dancers (two of which have disabilities), 10 BMX and mountain bike riders and 2 flatlands (the BMX solos on the main stage). The BMX and mountain bike tracks are long and composed of 9 modules up to 6 feet high, and total of 16 jumps. After leaving home the young athletes are blazing a trail for themselves. The Guardian of the discus is here to give them direction and he is here to hep them connect to their individual destinies and inspire them. This scene also included freestyle Frisbee, bungees, B-boy dancers, urban dancers and flatland BMX bikes. =The Moment of truth= This segment saw the entrance of the Olympic and PASO flags. The PASO flag was carried by two time Olympic gold medalist speed skater, Catriona Le May Doan, CEO of Amanda's Lemonade Stand, Amanda Belzowski, Canada's man in motion Rick Hansen, two time Olympic medalist in triathlon, Simon Whitfield, author Jewel Kats, sporting excellence and community leader Pinball Clemons, advocate for refugees Loly Rico and Canada's most celebrated baseball player Fergie Jenkins. The Olympic Flag was carried by author of Life of Pi: Yann Martel, the most decorated Canadian athlete in history Chantal Petitclerc, astronaut Chris Hadfield, Canadian hockey legend Bobby Orr, co-founder of the Aboriginal Professional Association of Canada, Gabrielle Scrimshaw, social activist Craig Kielburger, three time Olympic rowing champion Marnie McBean and six time Stanley Cup winner Mark Messier. After this the PASO anthem (instrumental) is played, while both flags are rose. This was followed by the athlete's oath taken by multiple Olympic medalist in trampoline Karen Cockburn and the judges oath taken by Stephan Duchesne. Following this was the speeches by CEO of TO2015, Saad Rafi and the president of PASO Julio Maglione. In between the two speeches was a tribute to the former president of PASO (by PASO Athlete's commission head Alexandra Orlando) Mario Vazquez Ra√±a, who died earlier in the year. After the speeches were done, Governor General David Johnston officially opened the games. =Building the Communities Cauldron= The 2015 Toronto Pan American Games Cauldron The flags of Ontario (carried by the Ontario Provincial Police) and Toronto (carried by Toronto Police, Toronto Paramedic Services, and Toronto Fire), followed by representatives of the Boys and Girls Club of Canada (from the Braeburn community in the underprivileged part of the city, Rexdale) enter the stadium and are raised. The Cauldron is made of 66 panels (called petals), and 30 of them were assembled on the structure during the ceremony. The panels are each engraved with unique symbols designed by the 30 communities of the Greater Golden Horseshoe region. =Yonge Street= The Guardian of running features in this segment, 9 towers high, 5 aerial treadmill runners and 120 dancers and acrobats feature in this segment. The heralds enter to reveal the final destination: Toronto. A city is born and a dream is realized when destinies of thousands of athletes converge. The five treadmill runners become the five guardians and they unite. The dancers mimic the grid of the city. The 30 community leaders also install their petals onto the cauldron while this segment was going on. =Lighting of the Pan American Games cauldron= The fireworks off the CN Tower Young diver Faith Zacharias comes on stage again and lights a new torch, and she passed it onto the members of the silver medal women's 4 √ó 400 m relay winning team at the 1984 Summer Olympics (in order): Dana Wright, Charmaine Crooks, Jillian Richardson, Molly Killingbeck and Marita Payne-Wiggins. Wiggins then passes of the torch to her son, NBA basketball player Andrew Wiggins. Wiggins then runs up the bleachers of the stadium to the final torchbearer retired NBA Player Steve Nash. Nash then runs outside the stadium where he ignites a bowl, which transfers the fire to the official cauldron. The ceremony concluded with a fireworks display shot off the CN Tower, and all the performers back on stage to celebrate.

Life  He is first mentioned during the reign of Leo VI the Wise (), when he held the title of patrikios and was tasked with collecting money (possibly in exchange for commuting military service) from the European themata. Under Leo VI's brother and successor, Alexander () he bore the supreme non-imperial title, that of magistros, which he may have received already under Leo. Follis with Empress-regent Zoe and her son, Constantine VII In June 913, shortly before his death, Alexander appointed him as guardian and member of a regency council for Leo's underage son, Constantine VII (), along with the Patriarch Nicholas I Mystikos, the fellow magistros Stephen, the rhaiktor John Lazanes, the otherwise obscure Euthymius and Alexander's henchmen Basilitzes and Gabrielopoulos. In this capacity, Eladas was instrumental in defeating the attempted coup of general Constantine Doukas, by mobilising the palace guard and arming the rowers of the imperial fleet. Eladas' forces confronted the rebel's supporters at the Chalke Gate, and in the ensuing clash, Constantine Doukas was killed. In August 913, along with his fellow members of the regency, Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos and the magistros Stephen, he received the sons of the Bulgarian tsar Simeon in the Palace of Blachernae. Both Eladas and Stephen soon began to oppose the dominance of the patriarch in the regency council, leading in March 914 to his departure and the assumption of the regency by Leo's widow Zoe Karbonopsina. Upon Eladas' advice, she removed Alexander's henchmen from the regency council. However, Eladas himself fell ill soon after, and withdrew from the Great Palace of Constantinople to that of Blachernae, where he died.

In 1721, the French court theater was dissolved by the monarch, who preferred German opera.

In September 2015, it was reported that Bruno Mars was set to curate the Super Bowl 50 halftime show, but the next month in October, It was reported that Maroon 5 was in talks to headline, but the band said they haven't had any conversations with the NFL about headlining, but were open to it. In late November 2015, reports surfaced stating that multiple acts would perform during the halftime show. Coldplay was confirmed as the lead half time performer for Super Bowl 50 on December 3, 2015, one day before the release of their seventh studio album A Head Full of Dreams. It was later confirmed that Beyonc√© and Bruno Mars would join Coldplay as special guests. When Chris Martin originally called Mars to ask him to perform with Coldplay, Mars was wary of a multi-artist performance. The singer of Coldplay then invited Mars to his studio in Malibu where he was working. There, Martin revealed to Mars that he wanted for him to perform \\"Uptown Funk\\" with Beyonc√©. Despite this, Mars remained skeptical and asked Martin to talk to Beyonc√© to determine how she felt about the idea. Martin immediately texted a video of himself with Mars to Beyonc√©, in which he asked her in the form of a song if she would come do the Super Bowl with both of them, to which she happily agreed. One day before the performance, Mars and Beyonc√© were \\"watching playback backstage\\" while Beyonc√© ate a bag of Cheetos. Mars asked her, \\"That's what you're doing?\\" to which she replied, \\"There's nothing more we can do these last two days. It's gonna be what it's gonna be. So I'm gonna enjoy this bag of Cheetos.\\" Mars admitted to learning a lot watching Beyonc√©'s preparation for the Super Bowl performance, saying that she is \\"coming for you every single time, so you better bring your A-game every time.\\" Performance Coldplay performing the halftime show. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin during the performance. Field during the halftime show. The audience participates in a card stunt The show opened with Chris Martin singing the opening chorus from \\"Yellow\\". He was then joined by the remaining band members of Coldplay to perform \\"Viva la Vida\\", \\"Paradise\\", and \\"Adventure of a Lifetime\\" with the Youth Orchestra Los Angeles conducted by Gustavo Dudamel and the University of California Marching Band. Bruno Mars, Mark Ronson, and a troupe of backing dancers (dressed in the style of Michael Jackson) then performed \\"Uptown Funk\\". Beyonc√©, also in a Jackson-inspired outfit and appearing with a set of backing dancers dressed as Black Panthers, then performed her new single \\"Formation\\" in a mass choreographed dance number before joining Mars onstage for a verse of \\"Uptown Funk\\". Coldplay played a snippet of \\"Clocks\\" transitioning into \\"Fix You,\\" and Martin sang along to some of the songs included in a video montage of past Super Bowl halftime and national anthem performances, containing acts by Bruce Springsteen, Missy Elliott, Katy Perry, The Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, James Brown, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, The Black Eyed Peas, U2, Prince, Beyonc√©, and Mars. The show concluded with the band performing \\"Up&Up;\\" with Beyonc√©, Mars, and everyone taking part in the show. At the end of the performance, the audience participated in a card-stunt creating a rainbow and the phrase, \\"Believe in love\\", the closing lyrics to Coldplay's A Head Full of Dreams. Critical reception Bruno Mars performed at the Super Bowl 50 halftime show and received positive reviews. The performance received generally mixed reviews from critics, who complimented Beyonc√© and Mars' part of the performance but were critical of Coldplay. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times stated that Coldplay \\"acted more as a stagehand than an actual performer\\" while Beyonc√©'s section of the performance was \\"the night's true event\\". Caramanica also noted that Beyonc√© and Mars \\"outsang\\" Martin during the closing part of the performance. Andrew Barker of Variety similarly noted that \\"Coldplay seemed resigned to politely allowing themselves to be played right off their own stage\\" by the \\"far flashier\\" Mars and Beyonc√©. In a review for Fox Sports, Chris Chase panned Coldplay's performance, calling it \\"inexplicable, indecipherable, and unnecessary\\" and a \\"musical snooze\\". Chase complimented Beyonc√©'s and Mars' appearances but described the performance as \\"boring\\". Alex Needham of The Guardian gave the performance four stars, saying that \\"Queen Bey at the height of her powers effortlessly overwhelmed Coldplay's widescreen anthems in a show that seemed lightweight until she showed up\\". Beyonc√©, seen here performing at the show, was both praised and castigated for her performance. Robert Bianco of USA Today stated that Martin \\"seemed overwhelmed\\" by the size of the event, and that despite being a \\"personable and energetic performer\\", an \\"awful lot\\" of Martin's energy \\"went into jumping\\". Bianco praised Beyonc√©'s appearance and stated that she \\"stole the show\\". Wendy Geller of Yahoo! also complimented Beyonc√©'s and Mars' appearances, but criticized the montage of previous halftime performances, describing it as \\"confusing rather than touching\\" and stating that the performance was \\"definitely a cold play\\". =Controversy= Following the performance, Beyonc√© was criticized for performing her new single \\"Formation\\", a song that they considered to be \\"anti-police\\", during the halftime show and for appearing to align herself with the Black Lives Matter movement. Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani accused the performance of being anti-police and also criticized Beyonc√©'s use of Black Power and Black Panther Party symbolism in her dance routine. \\"This is football, not Hollywood, and I thought it was really outrageous that she used it as a platform to attack police officers who are the people who protect her and protect us, and keep us alive,\\" he said. The controversy caused a \\"#BoycottBeyonce\\" hashtag on Twitter and protesters announced plans for an \\"anti-Beyonc√©\\" rally on the morning of February 16 outside of the NFL's headquarters in New York City, but no one showed up for such a rally. CNN political commentator Sally Kohn stated that \\"too many police continue to show themselves to be far more interested in reactionary defensiveness and preserving the abusive status quo.\\" Black Lives Matter activist and professor Melina Abdullah praised Beyonc√© and other artists who \\"are willing to raise social consciousness and use their artistry to advance social justice.\\" In attempt to address her own controversy, Beyonc√© explained, \\"I have so much admiration and respect for officers and the families of officers who sacrifice themselves to keep us safe. But let's be clear: I am against police brutality and injustice.\\" Commercial reception The halftime show became the fourth-highest-watched show in the United States, with total viewership of 115.5 million.http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7684905/lady-gaga-super- bowl-halftime-viewers-number Set list # \\"Yellow\\" # \\"Viva la Vida\\" # \\"Paradise\\" # \\"Adventure of a Lifetime\\" # \\"Uptown Funk\\" # \\"Formation\\" # \\"Fix You\\" / \\"Up&Up;\\" Setlist obtained from Billboard.

It contains the single species Condylodon audouini, first described from a single specimen by Lund (1831) in a paper on Brazilian ants. Taxonomy The type material is presumed to be lost and the taxonomy of species remains uncertain. It has variously been speculated to belong to different families and subfamilies, including Mutillidae, a family of wasps with females resembling large ants, by Swainson & Shuckard (1840). Dalla Torre (1893) relegated the genus to a junior synonym of Pseudomyrma (now Pseudomyrmex, subfamily Pseudomyrmecinae). Emery (1921) dubiously placed it in Ponerinae. Ward (1990) excluded the taxon from Pseudomyrmecinae, and agreed with Emery's placement in Ponerinae as the most likely candidate, and listed Ectatomma as a possible identity of the genus. Bolton (1994) placed it as incertae sedis in Ponerinae, and most recently, as incertae sedis in Formicidae (Bolton, 2003).

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 15, 2015. R. Lee Ermey reprises his role of Colonel Leslie Hapablap from \\"Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming\\". The title is a play on Waiting for Guffman. \\"Waiting for Duffman\\" was dedicated in memory of Sam Simon, a developer of The Simpsons who died seven days before it aired. Plot When Barry Huffman (the man who plays Duffman) undergoes hip replacement surgery following an injury during a parade and retires, Duff Beer's owner Howard K. Duff VII sets up a reality show called \\"So You Think You Can Duff\\" presented by Cat Deeley in order to find his replacement. The judges for this competition are Der Zip Zorp (a best-selling Electronica artist that wears a computer monitor-shaped helmet), Missy LeBeau (a former Duff Girl and current senator from Oklahoma), and Rajneesh Superstar (a billionaire Mumbai entrepreneur). The competition is fierce until only Homer Simpson and one other competitor remained. Homer wins the competition after the other contestant was disqualified upon Der Zip Zorp detecting a tattoo of Duff Beer's competitor Olde Ogdenville Ale on his back. Howard K. Duff VII tells him that he has inserted him with a chip that will reveal if he drinks, because he must stay sober on the job. While sober, Homer sees the misery that Duff is causing to the people and environment of Springfield. At a motor racing event, he gives out alcohol-free beer as a placebo in an attempt to convince the audience that alcohol is not essential for a good time. This angers them, and they form an angry mob. Howard K. Duff fires Homer and tells him that there was no chip, so Homer returns to heavy drinking. Following the incident, Howard K. Duff tracks down Barry Huffman (who is now working at a coffee shop) and convinces him to take his old job back. Reception The episode received a 1.5 rating and was watched by a total of 3.59 million people, making it the most watched show on Fox that night. Dennis Perkins of The A.V.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 17, 2015. Plot The Springfield Elementary School Math team is competing against Waverly Hills Elementary's Math team, in an event organized by Benjamin, Doug, and Gary. Lisa boasts that their poor school will surprise them all, which they do by scoring no points at all. Lisa is especially despondent, because Waverly Hills Elementary has way more funding than Springfield Elementary, and thus can afford the latest in technology, while Springfield Elementary is stuck using antiquated tools. After this educational embarrassment, the nerds decide to modernize Springfield Elementary School by cutting a massive check directly to Skinner (similar to Mark Zuckerberg's $100 million direct donations to the public schools of Newark, NJ) which enables each student to receive a tablet connected to a school network, replacing the blackboards with a giant touchscreen device and even building a 3D printing lab. Since all books are now digital, Principal Skinner decides to burn the \\"old\\" paper books, but a meltdown in the server breaks all the digital devices in the school. As all the paper books were destroyed, the teachers have nothing they can use to teach the students. Miss Hoover shows a movie in her cellphone. Lisa, unable to see the movie, looks out the window and sees Groundskeeper Willie using a rope with equally spaced knots to measure some grass patches. This gives Lisa the idea to turn the school into a Waldorf School, based on hands-on activities and creative play. All the kids like the new system, and Willie is promoted to math team coach. While teaching the math team, Willie sees that Superintendent Chalmers is abusing his services and tries to chase him down. During the chase, Bart throws an egg and hits Chalmers in the head, making him crash his car into a tree. Surprised by Bart's capacity of calculating angles, Willie invites Bart to be the new math team captain. Later, the Waverly Hills Elementary and Springfield Elementary Math teams have a rematch, but Bart is unprepared, as he did not realize there would be math (despite Lisa telling him there would be nothing but math). Despite this, the score is tied (29-29), and the teams are given a final: in a M shaped figure, the competitors have to draw three straight lines to form 9 non-overlapping triangles. All the competitors are stumped, until Bart remembers the \\"M\\" shaped hair in Homer's head and finds the solution, leading the Springfield Elementary's Math Team to victory. Lisa is very happy, though she's also horrified when Willie admits that the rope-measuring technique he showed her was actually a device that was used to torture and kill sheep thieves as the knots kept the victim alive longer to make the punishment more brutal. Production On September 26, 2014; while in a conference at the London Science Museum, Al Jean told that there would be a future episode with the following plot: \\"It will have Lisa on a math team and features the most complicated math jokes we [The Simpsons crew] can think of.\\" This episode's couch gag features a crossover with the animated series Rick and Morty. Dan Harmon wrote the first draft of the sequence with Justin Roiland performing rewrites. A sequence during the second Mathlympics scene features a section of the Kate Bush song \\"œÄ\\" from her album Aerial. Reception The episode received a 1.3 rating and was watched by a total of 2.82 million people. The episode received mixed reviews with praise going to the couch gag with Rick and Morty. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a D, saying \\"as the final act of \\"Mathlete's Feat,\\" the final episode of the 26th season of The Simpsons went to commercial. I was genuinely pissed at how disjointed, lazy, and downright lousy this season finale was.\\" Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode a 7.3/10, ultimately saying the episode was unfocused but was still amusing.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 25, 2015. The episode, like the other Treehouse of Horror episodes, comprises three self-contained segments. In \\"Wanted: Dead, Then Alive\\", Sideshow Bob finally murders Bart; in \\"Homerzilla\\", Homer plays the role of Godzilla and his American remake; and in \\"Telepaths of Glory\\", Lisa, Milhouse and Maggie receive telepathic powers. Showrunner Al Jean gave an interview about the episode in the month before it aired. Kelsey Grammer reprises his role as the guest voice of Sideshow Bob, and the opening musical sequence was animated by John Kricfalusi. \\"Treehouse of Horror XXVI\\" was watched by an audience of 6.75 million, the highest on Fox that night. Reception was mixed, with its perceived excess violence and lack of originality being criticized. Plot The episode opens with a John Kricfalusi-animated couch gag where the Simpson children are trick-or-treating before being set upon by soul-hungry spirits with a monstrous Frank Grimes among them that skins Bart for his soul before Maggie saves him and Lisa. The spirits chase after the Simpson children to their home, and the Frank Grimes monster takes Homer's soul. =Wanted: Dead, Then Alive= Bart gets a text message from Milhouse, telling him to come to the music room. When he gets there, he finds Sideshow Bob, who lured him there with Milhouse's phone in order to accomplish his lifelong dream: to kill Bart. Bob kills Bart with a spear gun and takes his body to his house to celebrate his accomplishment. As his main objective in life is done, he decides to complete other dreams, such as becoming a literature teacher at Springfield University, but is dissatisfied as his students are lazy cheaters. He discovers that the only thing that has made him happy was hunting down Bart for 24 years, so he builds a machine to bring Bart back to life so he can kill him over and over. Bob's machine is discovered by Santa's Little Helper, and the Simpson family break into his basement and reanimate Bart. Bob appears with a shotgun and has the legal right to kill the intruding Simpsons. Homer attacks Bob with a lamp, ripping his head off, and Marge decides that Bart can keep Bob's remains. Bart puts Bob's head into the Reanimator with a horn, frog legs, a chicken body, a tail and a booger, making a bizarre-looking creature. =Homerzilla= In a parody of Godzilla, a crazy old Japanese man based on Grampa Simpson is constantly mocked because every day he drops a perfect donut into the ocean. When asked why he does such things, he says that is because if he does not, a huge sea monster will rise and destroy the city. One day, as he is preparing a donut for his \\"ritual\\", he chokes on the toppings and dies. With nobody to drop the donuts, a sea monster called Homerzilla (Homer) wakes up and destroys the city. The scene cuts to the present time, where executives are watching the Homerzilla film, stating that it is so bad that it deserves a remake. Two years later, they release Zilla, a total failure. They throw all the merchandising into the ocean, but the containers wake up Homerzilla and a message appears reporting that he will return as soon as people have forgotten about the last film. =Telepaths of Glory= In a parody of Chronicle, Bart, Lisa and Milhouse are walking through a forest. Bart scares Lisa with dead owls, and she hits Milhouse's nose with the camera, making him lose his balance and fall into a giant hole. Bart and Lisa decide to jump into the hole to rescue him, making all the three stuck inside of it with nuclear waste from the power plant. The radioactive goo explodes, sending all three of them back outside the hole. When they wake up, Milhouse and Lisa discover that they have gained telekinesis, so they decide to use the powers for selfish purposes. Lisa only makes a few changes, but Milhouse goes mad with powers only to be struck by lightning. Lisa says she did not do it, making the family curious to discover who did this. The camera pans to reveal that Maggie also has telepathic powers, as she was using a radioactive rod as a pacifier. Maggie then uses her powers to benefit the world, such as turning Homerzilla into a larger Barney the Dinosaur before taking a nap while still floating in the air. The episode ends with Kang and Kodos on their spaceship, with Kang complaining that once again, they only have made a cameo appearance, despite Kodos admonishing him against it; before the show's producers proceed to reduce the aspect ratio from 16:9 to 4:3, much to Kodos' horror. Kang then says indignantly \\"Just 'cos it looks like season 4 doesn't make it season 4!\\" Production Kelsey Grammer, voice of Sideshow Bob, was excited that his character would finally kill Bart. In a September 2015 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Al Jean spoke about the episode, saying: \\"We're trying to break barriers and it's like nothing we've ever done. It's a bit of a very scary tribute to Hanna-Barbera cartoons, but updated. Then we have Sideshow Bob killing Bart. And if you wanted Bob to kill Bart, you're going to get your wish. I was always the kind of kid that wanted [Wile E.] Coyote to eat the Roadrunner, so this made me very happy\\". He added that Bob's voice actor, Kelsey Grammer, was excited by the prospect, exclaiming \\"Oh, finally!\\" The episode opens with a sequence animated by Ren & Stimpy creator John Kricfalusi, featuring a \\"Grinch-esque song\\" which \\"sneaks in Kricfalusi‚Äôs signature scatology while being quite catchy\\". Bob chastises his students for using Wikipedia for their research on T. S. Eliot, lamenting that \\"the author of Cats could be insulted further\\". Elvis Costello's 1979 single \\"Accidents Will Happen\\" plays as Bob repeatedly murders Bart. Reception The episode received a 2.8 rating and was watched by a total of 6.75 million people, making it the most watched show on Fox that night. The episode received mixed reviews. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, calling it \\"middling\\". He wrote that the first segment \\"just goes for the gore\\" and that there was \\"not much glee in the dark humor\\"; though he did praise Bart's death montage and compared it to those of Emperor Joker and its Batman: The Brave and the Bold adaptation, he concluded that the segment \\"is as repetitive as murdering your arch-enemy again and again and again.\\" He was more favoring towards the satire in \\"Homerzilla\\", but concluded that it had \\"not too much meat on [its] bones\\", and decried the lack of originality in the final segment, although he approved of Principal Skinner correcting graffiti to call himself a \\"wiener\\". Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode 6.9 out of 10, saying that it \\"offers a decent lineup of darker Springfield adventures. The standout is the return of Sideshow Bob, a story entertaining enough it really deserved its own, full-length episode. \\"Homerzilla\\" also has its moments. And while the lack of originality in \\"Telepaths of Glory\\" is disappointing, as a whole this episode is entertaining enough to fall comfortably in the middle of the pack as far as \\"Treehouse of Horror\\" episodes go.\\" References External links * * Category:2015 American television episodes Category:The Simpsons (season 27) episodes Category:Treehouse of Horror Category:Godzilla (franchise) Category:Television episodes about telepathy Category:Television episodes about murder Category:Television episodes about telekinesis Category:Television episodes about revenge Category:Television episodes about resurrection ","title":"Treehouse of Horror XXVI"},{"id":"45267285","text":"\\"Puffless\\" is the third episode of the twenty-seventh season of the animated television series The Simpsons, and the 577th episode of the series overall.

Homer is reluctant to go, claiming that the Bouviers hate him, but does so for Marge's sake. At Jacqueline's house, while watching slides which include Marge's father, Clancy, the question about how he died is brought up, something that Marge, Patty and Selma never knew about. Jacqueline reveals the truth: her husband died of lung cancer but she did not say so before because back then, people were reluctant to admit it and she thought smoking made Patty and Selma look cool. This revelation shocks Patty and Selma, who decide to quit smoking once and for all and burn all their cigarettes, which causes Jacqueline's house to burn down. At the DMV, Patty realizes how hard it is to quit smoking after years of addiction after thinking she was having a stroke. She also realizes that Selma is not affected by the sudden change of habits, and decides to consult Dr. Hibbert. At the hospital, Patty discovers that Selma relapsed ten minutes after quitting smoking. Patty gets angry and has a fight with Selma that leads to Patty staying at The Simpsons house for a while. Homer quickly gets annoyed by aspects of Patty's presence in his house such as her snoring while he and Marge are trying to have sex and accidentally seeing Patty in the shower. Meanwhile, at the apartment, Selma has a hard choice: quit smoking and reconcile with Patty or carry on smoking and lose her sister's respect. She decides to quit smoking and they reconcile. At the end of the episode, Patty and Selma return to their apartment and quickly notice in the absence of cigarette smoke the noxious odors in a small apartment that include two aging women, a baby and an iguana. They quickly take up smoking again to cover up the odors, though are unsure if it will be a happy ending. A montage of their life and death through smoking is shown as Rick Astley's \\"Together Forever\\" is heard in the background. Even after their death, cigarette smoke is seen rising from their graves. In a secondary plot known as \\"Maggie's Extraordinary Animal Adventure\\", Maggie befriends a squirrel who introduces her to other animals such as an owl, an opossum, and a parrot (which is revealed to belong to Duffman). However, Cletus captures the opossum for dinner and puts the captive animal under his dog's surveillance. Maggie makes a plan to fight against the Spucklers and free the opossum by assembling an army of animals. With help from Plopper the Spider-Pig, Maggie and the animals are able to free the opossum and defeat Cletus and his dog before going their separate ways, with the parrot returning to Duffman, having picked up some of Cletus's phrases. Reception The episode received a 1.5 rating and was watched by a total of 3.31 million people, making it the most watched show on Fox that night. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C, saying \\"It‚Äôs exactly half an episode that seeks to tell a character-based story.

Not that there haven‚Äôt been interesting, affecting Patty and Selma episodes in the past‚Äîhonestly, Selma‚Äôs rejection of her sham marriage to secret ichthyophile Troy McClure is one of the most improbably heartbreaking endings in Simpsons history.\\" References  External links  * * Category:2015 American television episodes Category:The Simpsons (season 27) episodes ","title":"Puffless"},{"id":"45267286","text":"\\"Lisa with an 'S'\\" is the seventh episode of the twenty-seventh season of the animated television series The Simpsons, and the 581st episode of the series overall. It aired in the United States on Fox on November 22, 2015. This marks the final episode to credit Sam Simon as executive producer until \\"Lisa the Veterinarian\\". Plot Homer, Moe, Lenny, Carl and Barney start the episode by singing a parody of Tonight as they prepare for the poker night at Moe's bar. On his way out, Homer promises Lisa that if he wins, he will pay for her to attend an elite band camp she's been accepted to, a camp that is the best one on their side of the Mississippi River (which side they're talking about is left unspecified). But Homer fails on a full house and ends up losing $5,000 to Broadway legend Laney Fontaine, who is now dating Moe because he has a liquor license. Trying to convince Laney to give his money back, he invites her to dinner only to show her how miserable they are. Lisa asks her to sing a song while she plays the saxophone. That's when Laney realizes that Lisa has a lot of talent and could become a famous show biz kid. She asks Marge to take Lisa for a month to perform on her shows. Marge angrily refuses, but Lisa convinces her to let her go, with a little help from Grandpa saying this might be the only opportunity to live her dreams. Laney takes Lisa to New York City where they met Lisa's former ballet teacher Chazz Busby. She easily passes the audition and gets cast in one of the Broadway shows. Later, during a Skype conversation, Marge determines that Lisa is not in a good place and decides to take the family to New York to get her back. On their way to the Big Apple, the family encounters Ned Flanders' Amish cousin Jacob in Pennsylvania and learn that Ned is now considered \\"ultra liberal\\" and a black sheep because he lives in the modern world. In New York City, the Simpsons and even Marge realize that Lisa fits right into the Broadway show world and they decide to go back to Springfield without her. Laney sees Marge's sacrifice and, having a change of heart, immediately kicks Lisa out of the show on the grounds that Lisa got more cheers than her, leaving Lisa free to return home with the Simpsons. The episode ends with Homer taking Ned's cousin to 740 Evergreen Terrace where Jacob makes Ned realize that he's guilty of pride. Both cousins reconcile by hugging Homer, much to his annoyance.

It originally aired in the United States on Fox on October 18, 2015. The plot follows the Simpson family, who decorates their house as ‚ÄúEverscream Terrors‚Äù. Homer goes a Halloween store and talks to Apu, the store‚Äôs owner, about three workers, who are promptly fired and plan vengeance against him. After an unsettling experience at the Krustyland Halloween Horror Night, Lisa develops a fear of Halloween decorations. Marge convinces Homer to take down Everscream Terrors, but he refuses. Marge then takes Bart and Maggie trick or treating, but everybody is asleep, making Bart upset. It is the only Halloween-themed episode of The Simpsons that is not part of the show‚Äôs Treehouse of Horror series. The episode received highly positive reviews from critics. Plot The day before Halloween, the Simpson family completely decorates their house, calling it \\"Everscream Terrors\\". Homer stores the plastic skeletons too close to the furnace, and he decides to take the remains to Grampa's home and buy something new at the Halloween pop-up store. On their way to the store, Lisa and Bart see a sign advertising the upcoming Krustyland Halloween Horror Night, and share their excitement for it. At the Halloween shop, Apu gets angry at three lazy employees who are sleeping on their jobs, telling them to go back to work. While Homer is looking for a decoration to replace the skeletons, one of the workers gives Homer a deal where if he buys one \\"Se√±or Skeleton\\", he will give Homer a set of four of them for free. Homer accepts the deal and tells Apu about it, who promptly fires the workers. The three then plot their revenge on Homer. Later, Homer takes the children to the Halloween Horror Night. Lisa gets scared by the costumed people and tells Homer that she wants to go home. Although Homer tells her that the Horror Night is not real, Lisa gets scared by the zombies, as well as more costumed people, leading to the park being closed. At school, Lisa's unsettling experience causes her to develop a fear of Halloween decorations, becoming scared from even the simplest Halloween figures such as paper zombies. In horror, she then hides inside a locker only to be rescued later by Marge. Back home, Marge tells Homer they should shut down Everscream Terrors for Lisa's sake, making both Homer and Bart upset. As Marge takes Bart and Maggie to the most famous Halloween block party at a cul-de-sac in Springfield, Homer tries to bond with Lisa offering to do a puzzle with her at home. At the same time, the three workers that Homer inadvertently got fired have come for their revenge, and begin to stalk Homer and Lisa. Homer locks up the house to protect them from the three men; however, they are already inside the house. He tries to take Lisa to the Flanders' house, but she runs back inside to get Tailee, a fur tail from Lisa's early childhood that brought her comfort. Homer rushes to save her, only for them to wind up face-to-face with the home invaders. Homer and Lisa run up the stairs and hide in the attic, and the invaders are unable to find them. Marge arrives at the block party with Bart and Maggie, but they are told by the security guard the party is for residents only after visitors wrecked last year's party. After unsuccessfully trying to bribe the security guard into letting them in, Marge tries to take Bart and Maggie trick-or-treating, but it is late out and all the children are asleep. The adults of Springfield come out in their mostly suggestive costumes and a musical number about adult Halloween follows (the musical number, \\"NC-17 Halloween\\", is a parody of \\"Time Warp\\" from The Rocky Horror Picture Show). At the Simpsons' house, Homer is able to calm down Lisa and they decide to use their various holiday decorations to signal for help, but they accidentally activate the Se√±or Skeletons, giving away their hiding location to the three men. Homer climbs onto the roof to light up the 4th of July fireworks, but the strong wind extinguishes the matches. Lisa then remembers that Tailee is made of polyester and will burn easily, so Lisa decides to sacrifice Tailee and light the fireworks to attract people's attention. This plan is a success, and the whole neighborhood wakes up. The home invaders are then arrested by the police almost immediately and Homer rebuilds Everscream Terrors so the whole town can enjoy it as Lenny and Carl arrive dressed as Kang and Kodos. Lisa, now unafraid of the decorations, also joins in the fun, and manages to scare Marge just as she arrives with Bart and Maggie. During the end credits, Maggie finds the half-burnt Tailee which magically restores itself to the tune of John Carpenter's Halloween. Reception The episode received a 1.7 rating and was watched by a total of 3.69 million people, making it the most watched show on Fox that night. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, stating \\"An impeccably directed, character-driven story about children‚Äôs fears and grown-up responsibility, the episode, credited to writer Carolyn Omine, is one of the most assured, human, and outright best Simpsons episodes in years.\\" The episode received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Animated Program.

Early years Gabrielle Duch√™ne was born into a bourgeois family in Paris on 26 February 1870. Although she became a socialist, she was a wealthy woman. She became interested in politics with the Dreyfus affair, and then became involved in philanthropic work. In 1908 she co-founded Entr‚Äôaide (Mutual Aid), a cooperative for the makers of lingerie and fashion items. In the following years she fought against exploitation of home workers in the garment industry, for higher wages and improved working conditions, for establishing a law defining minimum wages (which was enacted on 10 July 1915), for equal pay and for the promotion of syndicalism through education of the workers. Duch√™ne was a member of the council of the Chemiserie-Lingerie union, and from 1913 to 1915 she was president of the labor section of the National Council of French Women (CNFF: Conseil National des femmes fran√ßaises). She founded the French Office of Home Labor (OFTD: Office fran√ßais du Travail √† domicile) in 1913. She also founded the French Office for Women's Interests (OFIF: Office fran√ßais des int√©r√™ts f√©minins). Duch√™ne tried to reconcile radical unionist feminists with politically moderate bourgeois feminists, and promoted collaboration between the two groups. World War I During World War I (1914‚Äì18) Duch√™ne founded and became Assistant Secretary of the Inter-Union Committee for Action Against Exploitation of Women (CIACEF: Comit√© intersyndical d‚Äôaction contre l‚Äôexploitation de la femme). From the start of the war she was one of the small minority of pacifists who refused to accept the Union sacr√©e, an agreement by the left wing not to strike or take other action that could hinder the war effort. In 1915 Duch√™ne ceased union activism to devote her efforts to the pacifist cause, but retained her interest in the economic liberation of women. That year she was invited to the Hague Congress, where she met pacifists from many countries and where the idea emerged of creating an international league of women for pacifism and liberty. She was President of the French section of the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace (Comit√© international des femmes pour la paix permanente) founded in 1915. Duchene continued to agitate for peace throughout the war, without regard for her reputation or the risk of prosecution. The Comit√© d'Action Suffragiste (CAS) was created in December 1917, directed by Jeanne M√©lin, Marthe Bigot and Gabrielle Duch√™ne. The CAS organized meetings to which they tried to attract workers, for example by showing films. As well as agitating for women's suffrage, the CAS wanted to organize a referendum to end the fighting. Later years The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF, Ligue internationale des femmes pour la paix et la libert√©) was founded in 1919. Duch√™ne created the French section of the WILPF and directed it until her death in 1954. As she acknowledged, the Women's International League members were \\"women of the privileged classes\\". Until World War II (1939‚Äì45) Duchene was deeply involved in the WILPF, both in France and internationally. Duch√™ne was not given a passport to attend the peace conference in Zurich in 1919, but she and fifteen working women sent a letter to the congress that offered to \\"women of other nations good wishes and assurance that we are ready to work with them more ardently than ever to prepare the 'peace of tomorrow. She was among the WILPF delegates at the Versailles Peace Conference. After participating in the campaign to aid Russia between 1920 and 1923, she became increasingly sympathetic to the Russians. Following this she was associated with organizations such as the League against Imperialism and Colonial Oppression, and the Society of Friends of the USSR. Duch√™ne's pacifist beliefs were gradually influenced by the Russian experience, and have been called \\"tinged pacifism\\". In February 1927 Duch√™ne participated in Brussels in the Congress where the League against imperialism and colonial oppression was founded. Under the guidance of the Third International the league tried to develop struggles for independence in the European colonies. She made her first visit to Russia in October 1927. On her return she was openly a \\"fellow traveler\\" of the French Communist Party. She thought of Russia as a \\"land of peace\\" and a place where women were liberated, but did not have any profound understanding of Communist ideology. She was founder and secretary general of the Circle of the New Russia (Cercle de la Russie Neuve), which claimed to be independent of Russia and apolitical. However, her pacifist writings and speech included communist and pro-Russian propaganda, which caused tensions in the French section of the WILPF and in the WILPF's International Executive Committee. Duch√™ne participated in the General Conference on Disarmament in Frankfurt (1929) and in Paris (1932). In August 1932 Duch√™ne participated in developing the Congress Against Imperialist War, and in forming the World Committee Against War (Comit√© mondial contre la guerre). In the Congress Against War and Imperialism in Amsterdam, where the foundations were laid for the Amsterdam-Pleyel Movement, she was sponsored by Romain Rolland and Henri Barbusse. She was then one of the secretaries of the World Committee Against War and Fascism. In 1934 Duch√™ne organized the World Assembly of Women, and chaired its World Committee of Women against War and Fascism (CMF: Comit√© mondial des femmes contre la guerre et le fascisme). The CMF was formed at a congress in Paris in August 1934. Cor Ramondt-Hirschmann of the Netherlands records that the invitation left \\"no doubt whatever\\" about \\"the absolute communist character\\" of the proposal, although groups and individuals with diverse opinions were invited. Duch√™ne said the congress had a mood of great enthusiasm and brought together \\"the women that race, geographical situation, social milieu, intellectual formation, religion, philosophical conviction, individual or general interests, everything, finally, had separated until now\\". Efforts were made to avoid the meeting being a Communist Congress, but a WILPF member said the congress was pervaded by \\"the powerful current of Communist sympathy. The WILPF supported the CMF but remained a separate entity. Duch√™ne was present at the founding conference of the Universal Assembly for Peace in Brussels in September 1936. World War II (1939‚Äì45) was a difficult period for Duch√™ne, but by great good fortune her apartment was never raided and her records remain intact. Gabrielle Duch√™ne died on 3 August 1954 in Zurich, Switzerland, at the age of 84.

The Roi de Suede was engaged by Charles XII of Sweden because a French language court theater was regarded to be a compulsory thing in the representational life of a royal court at the time. Its leader was Rosidor fils, and commonly, the company have therefore been referred to as simply \\"The Rosidor Troupe\\". The company performed both spoken drama, opera and ballet, and was regarded to have upheld a high quality. The performances were staged at the residences of the royal court, as well as in the Bollhuset in Stockholm. The Great Northern War in 1700 caused financial difficulties for the court theater. The queen dowager would not allow the troupe to perform at court after the king had left to serve in the war. The king therefore gave permission to the Roi de Suede to perform at Bollhuset for the public in the city of Stockholm, and ordered the royal court to visit the performances there. From February 1700, they performed in public. Because of the language barrier, these were not a success among the majority of the public. They also arranged public masquerades with card gambling at Bollhuset, which evidently became popular, though also ill reputed. On at least one occasion, at Thorn in 1703, the troupe, or a part of it, traveled to perform for Charles XII during his war service. In 1703, several of the members of the troupe left when the contract was no longer renewed because of costs. A smaller part of the troupe, however, remained, acquired a second contract in 1704, and continued the activity in Stockholm until the end term of the second contract in 1706.

In the period between 1853 and 1859 railways were built by the Hessian Ludwig Railway on the left and right bank of the Rhine. Initially they were connected across the Rhine. As a result, a train ferry was established between Mainz and Gustavsburg, using two pontoons towed by paddle steamer to carry wagons across the Rhine. Passengers could use the steamer as a ferry from 1 August 1858. In between 1860 and 1862, the south bridge was designed by the engineering works and iron foundry Maschinenfabrik und Eisengie√üerei J.

History A small church at the site titled Santa Maria di Betlem was associated with a nearby convent of the Umiliati. In 1334, the property passed to an order of Servite nuns, who rebuilt the structures and dedicated the church to St Anne. It remained with this order until 1788, when the church was managed by Oratorian priests. By 1806, parts of the convent were used as a jail for women and an orphanage for boys. The prison was soon closed, and by 1819, the orphanage moved to the monastery of San Savino. In 1841, the convent then became use as a hospital and hospice run by Carmelites.

In 1868, the church took the role of parish church from the church of San Salvatore. The apse had been enlarged in 1500 to host the nuns during services. The construction of six side altars in the 17th-century caused the gothic lancet windows to be walled up. The facade of the church was not completed until 1925 using designs by Camillo Guidotti. The belltower was not erected until 1937 using designs by Pietro Berzolla.Parish official site. Much of the interior church decoration is from the past two centuries.

The third and final single, \\"1939 Returning/Chicken vs. Macho\\", reached number 94. Critical reception A review in the magazine Welsh Bands Weekly described The Great Brain Robbery as \\"fucking amazing\\", praising the performance of vocalist Davey MacManus as well as the \\"perfect harmony between voices and instruments\\". Songs such as \\"Mrs Playing Dead\\" and \\"On Something\\" were highlighted, with the author naming \\"Ella Luciana\\" as the best song on the album. Music magazine Kerrang! praised the album as an \\"eclectic, moving and passionate\\" work, praising MacManus and guitarist Dan Boone and labelling it \\"an album to cherish\\". In its review of the single \\"On Something\\", Kerrang! highlighted the track as an example of \\"the undescribable, cross-genre appeal of the folky punk 'n' rollers\\". Melody Maker writer Daniel Booth was less positive, however, awarding The Great Brain Robbery two and a half out of five stars and describing it as \\"the sound of poorly articulated angst slowly worming its way up its own arse\\". Booth directed particular criticism at MacManus's vocal style, and concluded by labelling the album a \\"crock of shit\\". The NME were similarly critical, awarding the album a rating of three out of ten and criticising an apparent \\"Midwest American\\" style of the material.

After winning one of her two races as a juvenile she improved to become a top-class performer in 1976, a year in which French-trained three- year-olds dominated the European classic races. After finishing third in the Prix de Diane she recorded Group One victories in the Irish Oaks and the Prix Vermeille, defeating top-quality opponents including Pawneese, Riverqueen, Sarah Siddons and Theia. Lagunette was sold at the end of 1976 but failed to win in four subsequent races and had little success as a broodmare. Background Lagunette was a \\"big, strong\\" bay mare with a broad white blaze and four white feet bred in France by Henry Berlin. Se was one of the best horses sired by Val de Loir who won the Prix du Jockey Club in 1962 and whose other progeny included Val de l'Orne and Comtesse de Loir. Lagunette was a full-sister of The Oaks winner La Lagune, being the last of four foals produced by the unraced broodmare Landerinette. Lagunette was acquired by Marius Berghgracht and sent into training with Fran√ßois Boutin at Chantilly. She was ridden in most of her races by Philippe Paquet. Racing career =1975: two-year-old season= After winning over 1600 metres on her racecourse debut, Lagunette was moved up in class and matched against colts in the Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud over 2000 metres on 8 November. Ridden by Philippe Paquet she started at odds of 10/1 and finished eighth of the nine runners behind Kano. =1976: three-year-old season= Lagunette finished fourth over 2000 metres on her first appearance as a three-year-old and was then moved up in distance to win the Prix de Tuileries over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. The filly was then dropped back in distance and moved up sharply in class for the Group One Prix de Diane over 2100 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 13 June. Starting a 28/1 outsider, she finished third behind Pawneese (winner of The Oaks) and Riverqueen (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches) but ahead of Sarah Siddons (Irish 1000 Guineas) and Theia (Crit√©rium des Pouliches). Lagunette was then sent to Ireland for the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles at the Curragh on 17 July and started 3/1 second favourite behind Acoma who had won a minor race at Saint-Cloud Racecourse by six lengths on her only previous start. Sarah Siddons was third choice in the betting in an eighteen-runner field which alo included the Vincent O'Brien-trained I've A Bee, the Cheshire Oaks winner African Dancer, the Oaks d'Italia winner Claire Valentine and the Lupe Stakes winner Laughing Girl. Paquet had problems obtaining a clear run when switching the filly to the outside inside the final quarter mile but Lagunette accelerated in the closing stages and won by two lengths from Sarah Siddons with I've A Bee half a length away in third place. Lagunette returned from her victory in Ireland to contest the Prix Vermeille on soft ground at Longchamp on 19 September. Pawneese, who had won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in July, started the odds-on favourite ahead of Riverqueen, with Lagunette, ridden as usual by Paquet, next in the betting on 14/1 in a ten-runner field which also included Sarah Siddons and Theia. Lagunette took the lead in the straight before being headed by Sarah Siddons inside the last 200 metres but rallied to defeat the Irish-trained filly by a nose after what Timeform described as a \\"tremendous battle\\". Theia finished fifth, whilst Pawneese and Riverqueen ran poorly in seventh and ninth places. On her final appearance of the season, Lagunette ran in France's most prestigious race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on 3 October. Ridden by Alain Lequeux she started at odds of 21/1 and finished fourteenth of the twenty runners behind Ivanjica. In October 1976, just before her run in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Lagunette was put up for auction at the Polo club sale with a reserve price of ‚Ç£3 million, but when the bidding ended at ‚Ç£2.8 million she was led out of the ring unsold. She was later sold privately to Walter Haefner's Moyglare Stud. =1977: four-year-old season= Lagunette remained in training with Boutin in 1977 but failed to reproduce her three- year-old form and was unplaced in her four races. She finished eighth in the Prix Ganay (ridden by Head), seventh in the Prix Jean de Chaudenay, ninth in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and eighth in the Prix du Prince d'Orange. Assessment and awards There was no International Classification of European horses in 1976: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the French Handicap she was rated the third-best three-year-old filly of the year behind Pawneese and Riverqueen. The independent Timeform organisation awarded Lagunette a rating of 122 in 1976, making her nine pounds inferior to their top-rated three-year-old filly Pawneese. Breeding record After her retirement from racing, Lagunette became a broodmare at the Moyglare Stud. She produced five colts and one filly between 1979 and 1986. All three of her colts that raced were winners. Data Traffic, a chestnut colt sired by Irish River, had a successful turf career winning seven races out of 41 starts. Safety Feature, an unraced bay filly foaled in 1985, sired by Be My Guest produced several minor winners including Trade Dispute, who won fourteen race between 1995 and 2003.

In Mishneh Torah, Rambam attributes the method to the first scholars (Chazal) and to Abraham. Similar concepts exist in the Rabbinic literature, Tosefta, and the Yerushalmi. Rabbi Yitzhak Arama also finds references in the Bible. Rambam determined that a person needs to take care of the soul as well as the body, and just as a sick person turns to a doctor, a person with mental illness must turn to the doctor of the soul, which is the philosopher or the sage. Rambam opposed the deterministic approach, arguing that a person has free will and the ability to shape his or her life. The concepts are part of a system which aims to improve the mental and moral qualities of a person. The hallmark of this method is its simplicity, presented as a part of Rambam's perception about the nature of the soul in the fourth chapter of his introduction to Pirkei Avot in the Mishnah (also known as the \\"Eight Chapters\\").

They, along with Krazy, then sing the song Ice Cream (I Scream, You Scream, We All Scream for Ice Cream). Krazy serves each of them a mug of his beverages. After they drink, the two guys leave but the spaniel remains in the shop to spend time with her boyfriend. Krazy takes her to another room within the shop, and turns on a player piano. He then sings a song in the melody of his theme music, and dances with the spaniel. Moments later, a labrador in a luxuriant car stops by the shop. The labrador courts the spaniel to have a ride with him. The spaniel appears enticed as she takes seat in the vehicle. The car leaves, and Krazy is in disbelief. The labrador takes the spaniel to a hotel. In the room they entered, the spaniel seems to lose interest with her new date as she tries to avoid him. At one moment she pretends to agree with him, and the labrador hesitates with affection. The spaniel uses this to tiptoe towards a telephone, and call Krazy. Krazy receives the call and quickly comes to the scene. The cat breaks into the hotel room, and engages the labrador in a fistfight. After trading several hits, Krazy emerges the victor. Throughout the entire fight, the spaniel is weeping, thinking her boyfriend is badly beaten. Krazy comforts her by placing the knocked out labrador on her like a scarf. Krazy and the spaniel are together and happy again.

Tucker's Grove Camp Meeting begins the 3rd Saturday of August, and continues until the 4th Sunday, also called 'Big Sunday'. Throughout the week of Camp Meeting, hundreds of camp participants move to the grounds to attend worship services and fellowship with family and friends. African American families in the Lincoln County area have come together for spiritual renewal and fellowship at camp meeting since after slavery ended. Mary Tucker, wife of a local landowner, gave the land for Tucker's Grove. Five United Methodist churches (Tucker's Grove, Brevard, Ebenezer, Rock Hill and St. James) and Gold Hill Baptist Church, sponsor the campground. The camp meeting has been operating continuously since 1874. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The Arbor The arbor, located in the center of the grounds, is a heavily timbered structure covered with a large tin roof. The trustees and others built the arbor using a grove and peg method. There were no spikes or nails used. Over the years, metal supports were added to strengthen the arbor. The original floor was dirt, then later saw dust or sand was used. It has a raised platform with a pulpit and in front of the platform a long wooden bench known as the mourners' bench, \\"seeker's bench\\" or \\"anxious seat.\\" It was renovated in 2017 with grant funding from the Duke Endowment. The height of the entries to the arbor was raised, some of the wooden beams were replaced with like-aged beams, and the tin on the roof was repaired or replaced. The Tents The arbor is surrounded by rows of 98 wooden frame 'tents' which form an almost continuous enclosure, roughly square in form. Each tent has a dining room, kitchen and one or more bedrooms. During the early days, people would walk to the campground, or arrive by horse and buggy and bring all of the essentials needed to camp out on the grounds. The camp participants would bring live chickens, and the 'Ice Man' would bring blocks of ice for people to buy in order to keep their food from spoiling. In recent years, some tent owners have added a second level with additional bedrooms, As the wood deteriorates, camp participants repair their tents with new or used wood. Most repairs take place prior to the opening of camp meeting. Many camp members who have moved to other areas plan their vacation so they can travel home to camp meeting. Concessions Upon entering the camp ground on the side facing the church, concession stand vendors sell a variety of food, clothes, jewelry, and misc items. The photography stand has been a permanent fixture on the grounds since 1958. The Monument In 2002, A slab of granite was donated and erected outside the arbor. It bears the inscription 'Tucker's Grove Campground, 1874' and has an engraving of a cross on the opposite side. This monument stands as a visual reminder of the rick, longstanding tradition of camp meeting at Tucker's Grove. The monument is surrounded by a colorful flower garden that is maintained by the Gregory Family. The Blessing of the Grounds An annual tradition at Tucker's is the blessing of the grounds. Since 2012, the host pastor has led a procession of Board of Trustee members and Camp Meeting participants around the grounds as he sprinkles Holy Water and old gospel hymns are sung. The blessing of the grounds occurs on the Friday evening before the official start of Camp Meeting. Board of Trustees There is a Board of Trustees that ensures that the historical structures remain intact by overseeing the operations of the grounds throughout the year. The Trustees work hard to ensure that the grounds continue to be well kept and acknowledged as the treasure that it is. The original trustees were: Wesley Abernathy, Henry Brevard, Milton Monday, and Alexander McLean. The Host Pastor Reverend Albert Perkins was the Pastor of Tucker's Grove United Methodist Church and host pastor of the camp ground for more than 33 years before his retirement in 2018. Dr. Marvin Caldwell has succeeded him as Host Pastor and Pastor of the church. References 3\\\\.

It was released on Smash Records in 1969. Background After leaving Sun Records for Smash in 1963, Lewis had scored only a few minor hits and, unhappy with the label's lack of enthusiasm for his recordings, appeared content to wait out the remainder of his contract. However, the surprise success of Another Place, Another Time and She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left Of Me) sparked new interest in the rock and roll legend, something he was quick to capitalize on after a decade in the commercial wilderness. As country music historian Colin Escott recounts in his essay for the 1986 Bear Family retrospective The Killer: The Smash/Mercury Years, \\"Jerry was holding the trump card; his third straight country hit 'She Still Comes Around,' was rapidly climbing the best sellers charts...Jerry was to receive a basic royalty rate of 7% of the suggested list price of all singles, tapes and albums. A far cry from the exorbitant 15% that some of the British superstars were getting at the same time but a damn sight better than the 3-5% that Sam Phillips liked to pay.\\" Lewis agreed to deliver at least three albums a year and would receive $13,000 as an advance after each album was completed. Lewis also assumed greater artistic control of the song selections and managed to secure a record deal for his sister, aspiring singer Linda Gail Lewis. Recording She Still Comes Around closely follows the same formula as Another Place, Another Time had from the year before: \\"hardcore\\" country arrangements performed in a no-nonsense fashion by Lewis and the top studio musicians in Nashville. Lewis interprets the songs with authenticity; in his 2014 authorized biography Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story, Rick Bragg states that these new songs were \\"simple ballads about losing, wanting, and walking on. Jerry Lee sang of shared misery, of a familiar pain, and knowing they were not alone made it easier, somehow, for his audience to get up the next morning, go back out in the world and do it all over again.\\" Produced by Jerry Kennedy, the album is another confident blend of honky-tonk and tear-in-your- beer ballads, the foremost being the Glenn Sutton title track, which peaked at number 2 on the country singles chart. This was followed with \\"To Make Love Sweeter For You,\\" which topped the charts in 1969 (his first number 1 since \\"Great Balls Of Fire\\" in 1958). Suddenly, in a remarkable turnaround, Jerry Lee Lewis was the hottest country artist in the business. The album includes another Merle Haggard song (the ballad \\"Today I Started Loving You Again\\") as well as several country standards, including \\"Release Me\\" and the drinking lament \\"There Stands The Glass.\\" \\"Out Of My Mind\\" was composed by Lewis's longtime guitarist Kenny Lovelace. The album is also noteworthy for containing a rereading of his long-forgotten 1959 Sun single \\"Let's Talk About Us.\\" Producer Jerry Kennedy would be a crucial component of this second wave of success in the next decade, balancing Lewis's rock and roll instincts with the traditionally conservative country radio. In the 2009 book Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost and Found, Kennedy insists that \\"Jerry was one of the easiest people I ever worked with. I've heard a lot of stories of how he butted head with other people, but we always got along great. I didn't spend a lot of time socializing with him. He would come to town, come to my office, and we'd listen to songs, and then we'd go into the studio and record. And then he would go home.\\" A famous bootleg of Lewis fan Keith Richards performing \\"She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left Of Me)\\" is widely available. Reception She Still Comes Around rose to number 12 on the Billboard country album chart. AllMusic calls it \\"a pure country record, made for late nights and smoky bars, and it's nearly as good as Another Place, containing the same consistent high quality of songs and performance.\\" Even the album cover - an evocative photo of a despondent Lewis in a decrepit hotel room - was singled out for praise for bringing the title track to life.

Jambu is boiled in water with salt, drained and put on the duck. It is served with rice and cassava flour. Cassava Withdrawals of cassava flour, the most, appreciated is the manioc flour.

The rebels seized the railway station Sheksna and broke railway communication on the Cherepovets-Vologda line, jeopardizing messages to Petrograd. The uprising was suppressed by Red Army troops arriving from Vologda and Cherpovets.  Background  The Sheksna Uprising was part of a wave of peasant uprisings that swept over Central Russia between November and December 1918. At that time, uprisings occurred at 138 of 268 counties under Bolshevik control. The primary reason for the uprisings was the peasants' discontent with the War Communist system's management of villages. The peasants in the rural districts involved in the Sheksna Uprising were dissatisfied with the excesses of local food detachments, and the deterioration of the economic situation in the villages. The front of the Russian Civil War was just north of the Vologda Governorate, leading to the Soviet government to intensify its mobilization measures: in addition to conscripting the local population to the Red Army, the government took away horses which were crucial for the peasant economy. The uprising was led by wealthy peasants whom the Soviet government labeled as Kulaks. Many were executed, while others were deprived of their civil rights.  Beginning of the Uprising  On December 1, 1918, peasant uprisings began in the Pochinok, Charomskoy, Ust-Uholka, First and Second Petrinevskoy, Yaganovskoy, Pachevskoy, Ivanovo, and Dargunskoy Bratkovsky volosts of the Vologda and Cherpovets Uyezds. Researchers identify three possible initial centers of the uprising: * The village Bratkovo (most likely center) * The village Churovskoye * The village Bolshoi Pochinok On that evening in the village Bratkovo, the peasants passed a resolution: The organizers of the uprising sent this message around the village of the neighboring volosts, where the peasants were passing similar resolutions. During their uprisings on December 1, the rebels defeated the executive committees at Bratkovsky, Pochinkovsky, Churovsky, and Ust-Uholka, and the military commissariat at Dargunovsky. Mobilization lists were destroyed, stationary cases were looted, and party and Komsomol activists and employees of the executive committees were arrested. On the same day some 300 rebels rushed to the train station Sheksna.  Taking the Station  The rebels clashed with the 1st regiment of the 8th detachment of the railway guard, consisting of 70 people whose resistance was quickly broken. Moreover, the squadron instructor ensign Belov defected to the rebels and led the revolt. The rebels dismantled 170 meters of railway track, disarmed the guards, toppled several telegraph poles, and broke the telegraph lines. The railway itself was blockaded by old railroad ties and rail. The railway bridge over the Sheksna was taken under the protection of the rebels, and the movement of trains between Vologda and Cherepovets was interrupted. The authorities feared that the rebels would blow up the bridge, cutting rail connections with Petrograd. The rebels killed 50 of the 70 soldiers in the 1st regiment. Others went over to the rebels. The weapons seized from the disarmed regiment and military enlistment offices were added to existed weapons cached in cellars. At this point, the rebels had a large number of rifles, grenades, and a few machine guns. The rebels also staged an ambush near the station Barbach, from which they could bombard incoming trains delivering Red Army units.  Suppression of the Uprising  Considerable forces were put towards the suppression of the uprising. The plan was to block the station from two sides: from Vologda and Cherepovets. By the evening of December 1, a detachment was formed in Cherepovets consisting of the Red Army and the local railway guard battalion regiment (about 100 people). The detachment was led by the provincial military commissar V. Y. Korolev, and the commissar of the detachment was I. Kozlov. An armored train under the name \\"Stepan Razin\\", summoned from Yaroslavl via Vologda, carried heavily armed soldiers and a cavalry unit commanded by the chief of the railway Gubchek Y. M. Brook. The general management of the Red Army troops from Vologda was done by the head of the Northern Railway defense Prologin. At the same time, armed troops were sent to the county townships. On December 2, the troops from Vologda and Cherepovets came close to the station Sheksna. On this day, a train with a detachment from Cherepovets arrived at the Ust Uholka railway crossing and was ambushed by the rebels. Unable to proceed, the train turned back towards Cherepovets to support artillery. The Red Army troops tried to capture the village Kurovo, where they believed the leaders of the rebels were hiding. However, they changed their route when they faced resistance from the village. On December 3, the village Bratkova, one of the most important strongholds of the rebel, was captured. The rebels in the village were dispersed, and the Red Army troops held captive were freed. Early in the morningy, troops from Vologda and Cherepovets stormed the station Sheksna. By the afternoon, the station was captured, the leader of the rebellion Belov disappeared, and railroad tracks were restored. At night, the Gubchek chief Y. M. Brook arrived at the station. On December 4, the nearby counties and points along the railway were swept. The most active participants in the uprising were arrested, and its leaders were shot by the decree of a military field tribunal. Among the executed were V. Ochelenkov, T. Tsvetkov, I. Veschezerov, F. Belolikov, the brothers A. and K. Lohichevy, the guard Chistotkin, and the peasant Kudryavtsev. On December 19, a wave of arrests swept the Vologda county. Among the arrested was the squadron instructor Belov who led the uprising at its final stage.

After the death of his father, he was an unsuccessful candidate for his father's Ward 8 council seat in 2015. Early life Marion Christopher Barry was born in June 1980 to Marion Barry and Barry's third wife, Effi Slaughter Barry. He was their only child. His father had wanted to name him Marion Barry III, but Effi was strongly opposed, and they decided to give him the middle name Christopher instead. For most of his adult life, Barry went by his middle name, Christopher. He attended both public and private elementary schools in the District of Columbia, Ben W. Murch Elementary and St. Albans School for Boys. He was pulled from St. Albans' after teasing by his classmates about his father's problems with women and drugs. After his parents divorced in 1993, he lived with his mother and attended Jefferson Junior High in Washington, DC. He graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School and briefly attended the University of the District of Columbia. He also attended Hampton University. In 2015, Barry described his relationship with his father being \\"more like brothers than father and son.\\" Barry dabbled with drugs and felt his father was unsympathetic to his problems. \\"Him having struggled with drugs, I would have wished he was there more. But he was more concerned about politics.\\" Barry formed a noteworthy construction business, Efficiency Contractors LLC, which he named in honor of his mother. Legal problems =Drug arrests= In February 2005, three police officers investigated an apartment where there was loud music and which smelled like marijuana. The officers announced their presence several times and, after no response, opened the door. Barry was alone in the apartment, which belonged to a friend. According to a court report, Barry attempted to punch one of the police officers, placed the officer in a headlock, and then punched the officer in the face several times. The officers wrestled Barry to the ground while Barry repeatedly said, \\"Get out of my house.\\" Barry was arrested and charged with assault of a police officer. In court, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge, acknowledging that he resisted arrest but denying punching or choking a police officer. Barry's plea agreement with prosecutors required that he maintain a job, enroll in school, and not use drugs. In 2006, during a series of drug tests required by his plea agreement, Barry tested positive for marijuana use. He received a warning from a judge. In July 2011, police officers were flagged down by an individual who said there was fighting and screaming inside Barry's apartment. Police officers reported to the apartment and announced their presence. When Barry refused to open the door, police officers entered the apartment, where they found a half-ounce vial of liquid PCP and five small plastic bags of marijuana. Barry jumped out of the first-floor apartment window and ran, leaving blood on the floor. Barry later returned, was treated for a bleeding foot, and was arrested. Barry claimed he was \\"self-medicating\\" with the drugs, and he was sentenced to 18 months of probation. The judge required Barry to undergo drug and grief counseling while on probation. In August 2013, police officers in Hampton, Virginia stopped Barry for driving erratically. According to court documents, police officers found marijuana on Barry and in the car. Barry was arrested and charged with driving under the influence and possession of marijuana. In May 2014, Barry was charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and operating a car without a license. A few days later, Barry was arrested for failing to obey a police officer, and the judge suspended his driver's license. Later that month, Barry was arrested for unlawful entry of a residence. Two months later, Barry was arrested for driving with a suspended license. In December 2014, prosecutors accepted a plea bargain to resolve charges related to the two driving incidents, and Barry was sentenced to nine months of probation. Barry claimed in April 2015 that he beat his drug problems with help from local politician Jim Graham. At a hearing in June 2015, a judge found that Barry violated the terms of his probation by driving with a revoked license. The judge sentenced Barry to 15 days in jail, to be served during five consecutive weekends beginning in July. =Assault charges= Marion S. Barry died of cardiac arrest on November 23, 2014, at the age of 78. At his father's memorial service, at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, Barry memorialized his father and referred to his sometimes difficult relationship with him. He introduced Louis Farrakhan, who in turn blessed the younger Barry. \\"What a joy to hear his son speak the way his father spoke,\\" Farrakhan said. On January 13, 2015, Barry attempted to withdraw $20,000 from an account at PNC Bank. A teller declined to process the withdrawal because Barry's account was overdrawn by $2,000. Barry allegedly threatened the bank teller, saying, \\"I'm going to have someone waiting for you when you get off, you bitch\\", and destroyed a surveillance camera. Barry was charged with assault, threat of assault, and destruction of property. Barry pleaded not guilty to the charges, and was ordered to stay away from the bank and the teller. Barry apologized to his followers on Twitter. Prosecutors offered Barry a plea agreement under which the simple assault charge would be dropped if Barry were to plead guilty to the misdemeanor charges of threats and destruction of property and receive up to 360 days of jail time. Barry did not accept the plea offer. Ultimately, a plea agreement was reached under which Barry pleaded guilty to all three counts and was given a 270-day suspended sentence and 12 months of probation. Barry continued to blame the bank teller, while pointing to his political legacy and grief over his father's death for the bank incident. \\"You have people sometimes that take advantage of their positions. I just think that when she sees the name 'Marion Barry,' she for some reason doesn't like me.\\" Thinking back to the event, Barry said, \\"I don't think I had realized how much I was still mourning.\\" Political campaign After his father's death, Barry started referring to himself by his given first name, Marion. On January 5, 2015, Barry announced that he would run for the Council of the District of Columbia representing Ward 8, which his father's death had made vacant. He appeared on the ballot as \\"Marion C. Barry\\", and was endorsed by former mayoral candidate Sulaimon Brown and former District Council Member Jim Graham. When the news media asked how he would explain his legal problems to voters, Barry said his experience with drug use made him qualified to help others going through \\"rough times in life\\". In the special election held April 28, 2015, Barry came in sixth place with eight percent of the vote. Death Barry died of an apparent drug overdose in the early morning hours of August 14, 2016. A police incident report stated that shortly before Barry suddenly \\"dropped,\\" he had smoked the synthetic drug K-2 and the hallucinogen PCP. He was found unconscious by his girlfriend and was taken to George Washington University Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 2:11 am. He was 36 years old. The D.C. coroner's office issued a report in November 2016 that said Barry died after smoking a lethal mixture of the synthetic cannabinoid known as \\"K2\\" and PCP.

However, they are laden with underlying assumptions that prevent oftentimes a scrupulous examination of organizations that populate our environment. Economics faces difficulties at embracing the variety of organizations, from clubs, associations, corporations, start-ups and so on and need simplifying principles to predict the functioning of markets. Sociology also has difficulties tackling the variety and complexity of organizations: it either focuses on organizations' inner working or study the formation of markets under the influence of organizations (e.g. contemporary economic sociology). The term \\"orgology\\" is formed by linking 'orgo' for organizations and 'logy' (from logos) and designates a reasoned study of organizations, which aims to study not only the world of organizations, their logics of action, their respective advantages and their internal consistency but also how each of us as individuals build meaning through our relationships with organizations. Drawing on economics, sociology, and organization theory as well as fields such as institutional theory and strategic management, orgology aims to develop a consistent and unique approach of organizations. Orgology emphasizes an intermediary level between macro-concepts ('the' society or 'the' market) and individuals, and approaches organizations as places to construct, administer and exhaust meaning for the world. As such, orgology aims to understand the raison d'√™tre of organizations as providers of solutions, the conditions of their existence and operation, the relationship among organizations and, more generally, the relationship between organizations and the environment. Orgology is primarily a reasoned analysis of the principles that determine the survival of organizations. It analyzes how organizations choose their resources, allocate and implement them, and how they build universes of meaning. It examines the consequences of these choices and the benefits in terms of legitimacy and competition. In each organization, management fills this allocation function‚Äîthe practices of assigning resources and roles, implementation and the creation of meaning. Without prejudice towards the goals for which management is implemented, different styles of management can be considered concrete expressions of orgology, located in a specific organization and applied locally. In this respect, orgology allows a distancing and comparison of styles, practices, rituals, myths, functions and effects of management; it leads to the surfacing of alternative managements. In a nutshell, orgology is thought as the scientific discipline that provides a rational and reasoned analysis of the role of the diverse existing managements, the legitimacy of logics of actions embodied by organizations,Patricia H.

It is native to shallow waters in the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, the Bahamas, Bermuda and Florida, and is listed as a \\"vulnerable species\\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Taxonomy Until recently this coral, along with Orbicella faveolata, was thought to be a variety of Orbicella annularis. There is very little morphological differences between them but studies have shown differences in corallite structure, life history, allozymes and distribution. All three members of this species complex used to be placed in the genus Montastraea. Description Colonies of Orbicella franksi usually form massive clumps with uneven surfaces, but sometimes forms plates, and in shady positions, may be encrusting. The general colour is orange-brown, greenish- brown or greyish-brown, but the extremities of the lumps are often pale or white. The corallites (the cups in which the polyps sit) are small, measuring across. The growing edges of this coral bear both large and small corallites which is in contrast to the closely related Orbicella faveolata, which has regularly spaced corallites at its growing edges. Distribution and habitat Orbicella franksi is native to the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, including Florida, the Bahamas and Bermuda. It typically grows on fore reefs (where it may be the most common species of coral) and its depth range is but it is typically found at depths of between . Status Orbicella franksi seems to be more resistant to coral diseases than some members of its genus, but is still susceptible to coral plague, yellow-band disease, black band disease and coral bleaching. The major threats it faces include climate change, ocean acidification and destruction of its reef habitat.

Mannerist facade. History The church and an adjacent convent and hospital were founded in 874 by Queen Angilberga, wife of the Emperor Louis II. She had been exiled some years after his death, but in 882, she was allowed to return to Italy, where she became abbess of the Benedictine convent, presumably this one. The convent became wealthy due to grants of significant privileges and properties in northern Italy. Over the centuries, several orders of monks and nuns competed for control of the convent until 1425, when it was assigned to the Benedictine order of Monte Cassino. In 1499, the convent commissioned the present church building from Alessio Tramello. It was consecrated in 1511. Facade The Mannerist facade was not competed until 1591.Nuovissima guida della citt√† di Piacenza con alquanti cenni topografici, statistici, e storici, by Tipografia Domenico Tagliaferri, Piazza de' Cavalli, #55, Piacenza (1842); Page 114. Asymmetries and odd touches abound. Side doors are smaller than the central one. The entry portal has a broken tympanum holding a central statuary niche within a rounded arch with a central bracket. The ground floor of the facade has half-columns, while the second floor has shorter pilasters topped by smiling gorgon masks that drain rainwater through their mouths. The central rose window is framed in a square, again with a broken tympanum and two central brackets. The facade has three life-sized statues of San Germano, San Sisto, and St. Benedict. San Sisto is the church's namesake, while San Germano and St. Benedict are both associated with Cassino, the location of the first Benedictine monastery. The busts of two female saints, Barbara and Martina, also appear on the fa√ßade, above each of the side windows. The adjacent Renaissance-style convent (1591-1596) is owned by the military and closed to visitors. The cloister has a number of medallions frescoed by Bernardino Zacchetti. Interior Sistine Madonna attributed to Pietro Antonio Avanzini Sistine Madonna by Raphael The interior has chapels frescoed by Antonio and Vincenzo Campi, there is an altarpiece and a in the choir of massacre of the innocents by Camillo Procaccini and another painting by Jacopo Palma il Giovane in the choir. The cupola at the center of the transept was frescoed by Bernardino Zacchetti. At the end of the Nave, in the choir of the apse is a copy of the Raphael's Sistine Madonna attributed to Pietro Antonio Avanzini.Avanzini died in 1733, before the painting was sold. To the great loss of Piacenza, the Benedictines pawned off the original in 1754 to Augustus III, King of Poland for the lordly sum of twelve thousand zecchini. The painting is now one of the masterpieces on display at the Gem√§ldegalerie in DresdenChurch of St. Sixt (Piacenza); To the left of the transept is the altar and tomb dedicated to Margaret of Parma, designed by Simone Moschino.

It was completed in 1954 as part of the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington Parkway project. About the bridge =Early efforts to build the Baltimore-Washington Parkway= U.S. Route 1 in the District of Columbia led to U.S. Route 1 in Maryland, and from about 1911 to 1954 was the only major highway from the District of Columbia to Baltimore, Maryland, and Annapolis, Maryland. In the District of Columbia, Route 1 followed Maryland Avenue SW and NE to the intersection with Bladensburg Road and then followed Bladensburg Road to the District boundary with Maryland. In Maryland, U.S. Route 1 was a two-lane, shoulder-less highway that rapidly became clogged with traffic in the 1930s. It was so hazardous, having been constructed at a time when automobiles traveled at much slower speeds, that it earned the sobriquets \\"Suicide Lane,\\" \\"Bloody Mary,\\", and \\"Old Bloody.\\" As early as 1910, however, the Maryland State Roads Commission began planning for a wide, concrete highway to replace Route 1. Planning for the new road continued through the 1920s but gained momentum when Frederic Adrian Delano, chairman of the National Capital Parks and Planning Commission (NCPPC), took an interest in the route in the late 1920s. But significant opposition to the new highway came from the government of the District of Columbia, which foresaw multimillion-dollar expenditures from being forced to extend New York Avenue, build new bridges, and build an interchange with the parkway. A bridge carrying New York Avenue over the Anacostia River was first proposed by the District of Columbia Highway Department in 1941. The bridge would also create a grade separation between South Dakota Avenue NE and New York Avenue NE, allowing South Dakota Avenue traffic to pass under New York Avenue and separate the two heavy streams of traffic. In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt directed that $2 million of National Industrial Recovery Act public works funding be used to obtain a wider right of way along Route 1 from the District line to Fort Meade, Maryland. That highway should enter the District of Columbia and connect with New York Avenue NE appears to have been a noncontroversial and almost unanimously accepted design element. At that time, New York Avenue NE did not extend past Bladensburg Road NE. With the bridge recommendation not finding legislative favor, the Commissioners of the District of Columbia agreed in May 1942 to extend New York Avenue to the District line. But resource demands caused by World War II postponed work on the extension, and by 1946 the city had still not extended New York Avenue past Bladensburg Road. =Bridge construction= In 1949, a bill was introduced in Congress to complete the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. Hearings on the bill were held in 1950. Gordon R. Young, engineer with the D.C. Highways Department argued for federal funding of the D.C. portion of the project. The cost of connecting the parkway to city streets would be $2.25 million, he said. Constructing an interchange, bridge, and other aspects of the parkway would overwhelm the city's small roads and bridges budget. Young also argued for extension of the parkway south along the eastern banks of the Anacostia River. The parkway would be of little value, he concluded, to intra-District travel, but could serve as a bypass for heavy trucks traveling south. The House Committee on Public Works agreed, and added of parkway inside the District of Columbia (between the District line and South Dakota Avenue NE) to federalize the bridge and interchange as Young had requested. President Harry S. Truman signed the bill into law on August 3, 1950. The New York Avenue Bridge was part of a larger project which included an overpass over the tracks of the Pennsylvania Railroad, an overpass over South Dakota Avenue NE, and extensions of both New York Avenue and South Dakota Avenue. The cost of the railroad overpass was estimated at about $200,000, and the South Dakota Avenue overpass at about $300,000. New York Avenue NE ended at an intersection with Bladensburg Road, and no grading or road existed beyond that point. South Dakota Avenue NE extended from Bladensburg Road NE to about 33rd Place NE, but this four block stretch was merely a graded dirt road. The design of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway required New York Avenue NE to have six lanes from the Kenilworth Interchange to South Dakota Avenue NE, and then shift to four lanes between South Dakota Avenue NE and Bladensburg Road NE. South Dakota Avenue NE would have four lanes between New York Avenue NE and Bladensburg Road NE, then drop to the street's existing two lanes beyond that. Grading and paving of New York Avenue NE from Bladensburg Road to the Pennsylvania Railroad tracks was anticipated to cost $150,000, while grading and building New York Avenue from South Dakota Avenue NE to the border of Anacostia Park was estimated at $70,500. (Anacostia Park was federal land, therefore any bridge or roadway through or over the park was a federal responsibility.) The city estimated it would take $160,000 to pave South Dakota Avenue NE from Bladensburg Road to New York Avenue NE. The total cost of the entire project was estimated in November 1950 at $2.38 million. The architectural firm of Mills & Petticord designed the bridge and overpasses, and the NCPPC approved the New York Avenue Bridge's design in May 1951. The design for the Kenilworth Interchange was approved by the federal government in late March 1951. The interchange was designed to handle 32,000 automobiles per day, with nearly 11,000 of these using the off-ramps to reach New York Avenue. Excavation work on the two overpasses began about July 1, 1951. By this time, the cost of railroad overpass had risen to $300,000, while the cost of the South Dakota Avenue overpass had fallen to $250,000. By February 1952, delays had caused estimated costs to rise to $2.51 million for the entire project, with work now expected to begin on the overpasses in the summer 1952. They were to be finished in summer 1953. The New York Avenue Bridge itself did not win design approval until August 1952, when the United States Army Corps of Engineers gave its consent. Construction of the bridge would be handled by the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR). The long steel bridge was expected to cost $1 million to $1.5 million. The BPR said at that time that contracts would be awarded in October 1952, and work on the bridge was expected to begin in November and last 18 months. To accommodate construction of the bridge, the United States Department of Justice gave a strip of land belonging to the National Training School for Boys to the District of Columbia in December 1952. The western approaches and abutments of the New York Avenue Bridge were built on this land. To further aid in construction, a temporary bridge was built over the Anacostia River and used by construction crews in building the new permanent span. In February 1954, construction on the bridge had advanced to the point where officials believed it would open on time in the fall of 1954. In May 1954, BPR advertised for bids to build the eastern and western approaches to the bridge. =Dedication= The final cost of the entire road extension, overpass, and New York Avenue Bridge was $2 million to $2.1 million. The cost of the New York Avenue Bridge was reported to be either $1.2 million or $1.4 million. The New York Avenue Bridge was dedicated and opened along with the rest of the federally-built portion of the Baltimore- Washington Parkway on October 22, 1954. The New York Avenue Bridge was expected to carry just 11,000 automobiles a day when it opened, but within a week of its dedication it was carrying more than 21,000 automobiles a day. Roughly 18,000 of these vehicles used New York Avenue NE, while about 3,000 used South Dakota Avenue NE.

She and Lois Jotter became the first two women to raft the entire length of the Grand Canyon. Early life and education Elzada Urseba Clover was born in Auburn, Nebraska in 1897, the seventh of nine children of Maynard French Clover and Sarah Gates Clover. She had six sisters (Alice, Mabel, Bessie, Vida, Cora, and Maud) and two brothers (Maynard and Verne). She grew up on her father's farm and attended high school in the nearby town of Peru. Her mother died in 1913 and her father remarried around 1925 and moved to Texas, where he set up as a farmer near Alamo. Clover began her career as a public school teacher in 1919, working first in Nebraska and later in Texas.; she also supervised an Indian mission school in the latter state. She was graduated from Nebraska State Teachers College in 1930 and went on to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, for her M.S. (1932) and Ph.D. (1935) degrees. The subject of her doctoral thesis was the vegetation of the lower Rio Grande Valley. Career After obtaining her doctorate, Clover joined the faculty at the University of Michigan as an instructor in botany and the assistant curator of the university's botanical gardens. Eventually she rose to the position of curator of the botanical gardens (1957) and full professor of botany (1960). She also taught at the university's Biological Station in Pellston. Dr. Elzada Clover at Bright Angel Creek in Grand Canyon, July 1938 Clover was instrumental in establishing the cactus and succulent areas of the botanical gardens. She made numerous expeditions throughout the Southwest in search of native plant species for the university collection, focusing initially on cacti of the Colorado Plateau in Utah. In the late 1930s, she started planning a research trip down the Colorado River to catalog its flora, and the university gave her some funding for the trip in the expectation that it would yield specimens for its collection. Although she originally intended to go by pack mule, she discussed the idea of going by boat instead with the pioneering Colorado River boatman, Norman Nevills, whom she met on a collecting expedition in Mexican Hat, Utah.Marston, Otis R., (2014). \\"From Powell To Power; A Recounting of the First One Hundred River Runners Through the Grand Canyon. Flagstaff, Arizona: Vishnu Temple Press, p. 405 In the 1930s, boating the Grand Canyon was a rare event. A few men had done it successfully, but the only woman to have tried it had not survived her attempt. Asked about the general opinion that the Grand Canyon trip was no place for a woman, Clover responded: \\"Just because the only woman who ever attempted this trip was drowned is no reason women have any more to fear than men.\\" The Clover and Nevills 1938 expedition traveled from the town of Green River in Utah through the Cataract and Grand Canyons all the way to Lake Mead. The trip took 43 days in three boats that were custom-built by Nevills and his father‚Äîthe Wen, the Botany, and the Mexican Hat‚Äîand covered more than 600 miles all told. In the course of this trip, Clover became the first botanist to catalog plant life along the river in the Grand Canyon. Clover and graduate student, Lois Jotter, became the first women to complete a river run of the Grand Canyon. Also on the trip were graduate students, Eugene Atkinson, artist Bill Gibson (who took photographs and film of the trip), and, as Nevills's assistant, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist named Don Harris. Part way through the trip, due to tensions among expedition members, Atkinson left and was replaced by photographer Emery Kolb. Clover and Jotter made plant lists and collected specimens throughout the trip, although the rigors of the journey‚Äîespecially lack of space and difficulty keeping specimens dry‚Äîmeant that they ended up with fewer specimens than they had hoped. They described the canyon as having five plant zones, from the moist sand along the river's edge up to higher zones with shrubs and trees. Most of what they found were typical riparian species, with a major exception being tamarisk, a non-native species that they saw in a few locations. They found very little snakeweed, which has since become common throughout the canyon. Their survey remains the only comprehensive one done on the river's riparian species in the era before Glen Canyon Dam was built. After the trip, Clover and Jotter published the botanical findings of the trip in a 1944 issue of American Midland Naturalist. Clover's next expedition was on the San Juan River and in Texas, where she gathered fossil plant specimens, which was followed by a 1939 trip to Havasupai Canyon in Arizona. She published the findings from these trips in a 1941 article co-authored with Jotter entitled \\"Cacti of the Colorado River and Tributaries\\". In the years afterward, Clover focused her research on the deserts of Mexico and Guatemala and also did some work in Haiti. Clover joined a number of professional societies, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Botanical Society of America, and the Michigan Academy of Science. She retired from the university in 1967 and moved to the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. She died in 1980, and her papers are now held by Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan.

She is the daughter of Antonio Deinde Fernandez, a Nigerian billionaire ambassador. In 2014, she sang with the band Pink Grenade, and released two controversial videos that picked up millions of online views. She left her label later that year. Early life Fernandez was born at the American Hospital of Paris in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a commune in the western suburbs of Paris, France. Her father was billionaire Antonio Deinde Fernandez from Lagos State in southwestern Nigeria, who had moved to the United States as a young adult. His Fernandez clan descended from a Portuguese-Brazilian slave trader who raised a family with an African wife in Lagos in the early 19th century. Fernandez's father had four earlier unions; his third wife was white American Barbara Joyce who married him in 1961 while they were living in Virginia, bore him three children in the United States, separated from him in 1984 or early 1985, then filed for divorce in 1987. His fourth partner was Princess Abiola Dosunmu, who married him in Nigeria in April 1973 in a well-attended ceremony. The union produced a daughter and lasted until 1987‚Äì1988. His fifth partner, Fernandez's African-American mother, was born Sandra Inett Price. She took the name Aduke Fernandez at their union, which she said began in 1982 with a tribal wedding in Nigeria, though he later said they were never formally married. The first child born to the couple was daughter Atinuke in 1984, then Abimbola followed in 1989. Her French birth certificate states her name as Darnel Abimbola Olumegbon Fernandez and her mother's name as Aduke Olufunmilola Olumegbon Price Fernandez. The shared name of Olumegbon comes from the Olumegbon noble line of Isale-Eko, Lagos; her father was a descendant of this ruling house through his mother. After the birth of Fernandez, the family lived a short while in the Hotel Ritz Paris, then moved to the Chateau de Bois-Feuillette in Pontpoint. Another move took her to New York, her father buying the historic All View Estate at the southern tip of Premium Point, New Rochelle. Fernandez began learning the violin at age four. At age six, she attended Rye Country Day School, and later the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Connecticut. At age 10, she moved with the family to Edinburgh, where she attended Fettes College. At 13, she started playing guitar. Fernandez graduated from Fettes at age 18. She took classes in video production at The Art Institute of New York City, then in 2009, enrolled at Oxford Brookes University at Oxford. When she dropped out after one month to follow a music career, her father disapproved. Text hosted by thefreelibrary.com. Also hosted by HighBeam Research. Throughout her childhood, Fernandez lived a sheltered life as a rich man's daughter, traveling the world on his jet, especially to African nations, and vacationing in the summers on his 150-foot yacht, Yemoja. She trained as an equestrian, competing in six national horse shows. Her father worried she might be kidnapped and held for ransom. Many world figures visited her home on business with her father, including Pope John Paul II, George H. W. Bush, Kofi Annan, Nelson Mandela and Mobutu Sese Seko.

In May 2003 while she was in school in Scotland, her father moved out of their Edinburgh home, and her mother initiated divorce proceedings, suing for ¬£300 million, reported at the time as one of the largest-ever divorce suits. The case was eventually settled for 36 monthly payments of ¬£30,000 totalling ¬£1,080,000. Fashion In her teens, Fernandez modeled once for Vivienne Westwood during the Edinburgh Fashion Week. Living on her own in New York, her wardrobe includes designer clothing such as a cocktail dress by Carmen Marc Valvo, and a Gasparee caftan by Gillian Harding. She inherited her mother's collection of couture clothing including multiple caftans, one by Jean-Paul Gaultier, and other items by Givenchy, Chanel, Oscar de la Renta and more. Music Fernandez started writing songs on her guitar in her teens. She went to concerts and got to know the members of punk group Forever the Sickest Kids, and Gabe Saporta, the leader and singer of the electro-pop band Cobra Starship. In 2009, Fernandez sang backing vocals on the band's song \\"Nice Guys Finish Last\\", and she modeled for the album cover of Hot Mess, which reached number 4 on the Billboard 200 to become Cobra Starship's most successful album. Fernandez also modeled for the cover of the band's single, \\"Good Girls Go Bad\\". Taking the stage name Madame Luxe, Fernandez began collaborating with various musicians. EDM artist Draper, also an alumnus of Oxford Brookes University, featured Madame Luxe singing on his dubstep song \\"Painting the Sky\\", uploaded to SoundCloud in June 2011. The song was included on Draper's self-titled EP, released in February 2012 on the Drop Dead label run by Bring Me the Horizon frontman Oliver Sykes. Fernandez collaborated with the deejay trio , singing lead and backing vocals on the songs \\"Tongue Twister\\" and \\"We Don't Sleep at Night\\", both released on the Japan-only version of the album The Beat Goes On in September 2012. Fernandez was also featured on \\"Love Crime (Not Innocent)\\", uploaded to SoundCloud in 2013. In November 2013, Fernandez signed to SMH Records, founded by Jonathan Hay and Mike Smith, who formed the band Pink Grenade around Fernandez. Credited as Bim Fernandez, she played guitar and sang on the songs \\"Lets Take It Naked\\" and \\"Lipstick\\", sharing the latter song's co-writing credit with Hay and . The pop song \\"Let's Take It Naked\\" was released for streaming online in January 2014. On July 1, 2014, a video for \\"Let's Take It Naked\\" was uploaded to Vevo and WorldStarHipHop, amassing 7.5 million views in its first week. The video contrasted the upbeat, poppy music with fictional scenes of Fernandez partying with boys and cocaine, cooking meth, and playing Russian Roulette, fitted with a prosthetic pregnant belly as if she was in the last months of pregnancy. The Herald in Nigeria called the video \\"scandalous, disturbing and provocative.\\" The video was taken down by Vevo and WorldStarHipHop but can still be viewed on Tidal. A video for the hip-hop single \\"Lipstick\\", was released on July 23, 2014, with scenes of Fernandez performing, alternating with scenes of women playing with red lipstick and paint. The \\"sexually charged\\" song has lyrics suggesting fellatio, and at the end a male voice \\"disses\\" Kim Kardashian and her family. The songs were included in late July on the Pink Grenade album, Fear of a Pink Planet, distributed through Caroline Records. Fernandez left SMH Records in November 2014. Personal life Fernandez's mother died of colon cancer in May 2013. The loss caused Fernandez to re-evaluate her career, and to push forward in music, as her mother had wished, unlike her father who had cut off her allowance for a few years because he disapproved of her music path. After her father died in September 2015, Fernandez posted tribute messages and family photos on her Instagram account, showing her father together with her. With her father dead, Fernandez and her step-mother Halima, her father's sixth long-term partner, became embroiled in a bitter dispute about inheritance. Halima did not consider Fernandez to be a legitimate heir of her father, while Fernandez said Halima was never married to her father. Fernandez wrote that Halima was not considerate of the father's wish to be buried in Nigeria with a state funeral, burying him instead in Belgium where he died, and arranging a smaller funeral service, conducted with insulting insinuations aimed at Fernandez's deceased mother. The dispute spilled over into online jabs.

He is the author of Hyping Health Risks: Environmental Hazards in Daily Life and the Science of Epidemiology and Getting Risk Right: Understanding the Science of Elusive Health Risks.  Scientific work  Over a forty-year career, Kabat has studied a wide range of lifestyle, clinical, and environmental exposures in relation to cancer and other diseases, and mortality. Major topics of interest include: smoking, alcohol consumption, diet and nutrition, endogenous and exogenous hormones, obesity and height, the metabolic syndrome, physical activity, electromagnetic fields, and sleep. In 2003, Kabat, who then worked at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, co-authored a study in BMJ examining the association between passive smoking and tobacco-related mortality. The study concluded that its results \\"do not support a causal relation between environmental tobacco smoke and tobacco related mortality.\\" The study was partly funded by the tobacco industry and was heavily publicized by it, and was criticized for using a dataset that did not include an \\"unexposed\\" group. In his book Hyping Health Risks, Kabat describes the criticism of this study as scientific McCarthyism.  Books  Kabat is the author of the book Hyping Health Risks, published in 2008 by Columbia University Press. The book examines several alleged environmental health risks, such as the proposed link between artificial chemicals and cancer, and concludes that these risks have been distorted. In the book, Kabat also discusses the science relating to the adverse health effects of passive smoking, arguing that anti-smoking activists have manipulated the results of scientific studies to justify increasingly stringent anti-smoking regulations. Skeptical Inquirer notes that \\"Kabat ... helps readers understand relative versus absolute risk, medical research, [and] how pseudoscientific and questionable claims get [mis]reported by news media and activists....\\" David A. Savitz reviewed the book and wrote \\"For the most part, the story of truth and misrepresentation of evidence on health risks [in the book] was engaging\\".

In a more negative review, Neil Pearce wrote in the International Journal of Epidemiology that he \\"became more frustrated and less impressed as [he] worked [his] way through the book\\" and criticized the book for what he called its \\"lack of balance\\". Terence Hines wrote that Kabat \\"more than accomplishes\\" his goals of discovering how it is that extraordinary progress is made solving some problems but little is made solving others and why instances of progress get little attention while scientifically questionable issues get more attention. Hines said of the chapter reviewing the question of whether cell phones cause cancer, it \\"alone is worth the price of the book.\\" Kabat wrote another book building on the themes in Hyping Health Risks that was published in 2016.

The album was released in 1969 on the Smash record label. Background In the wake of his comeback success with the album Another Place, Another Time in 1968, Lewis renegotiated his record contract with Smash and secured a deal for his sister Linda Gail, who had been part of his road show for years. Five years earlier, Sam Phillips had actually signed Linda Gail to Sun Records (largely to placate her brother) and cut several sides with her, even using their duet of the George Jones song \\"Seasons of My Heart\\" as the B-side of the Lewis single \\"Teenage Letter\\", but scrapped any further releases after Lewis left the label. She eventually managed to release a couple of singles with ABC Paramount and Columbia but, as Colin Escott's put it in the liner notes for the 1986 retrospective The Killer: The Smash/Mercury Years, Linda Gail's ambitions \\"unfortunately outstripped her talent.\\" Contents Jerry Lee and Linda Gail's rendition of \\"Don't Let Me Cross Over\\" was issued as single and rose to number 12 on the Billboard country singles chart. The album also includes several songs that had been hit duets for other artists, such as \\"Jackson\\" and \\"Milwaukee (Here I Come)\\". \\"Don't Take It Out on Me\\" was written by Linda Gail and Jerry Lee's guitarist Kenny Lovelace, and the same pair teamed up with Jerry Lee's manager Cecil Harrelson to compose \\"Secret Places\\".

This period coincided with his meeting Nico (Velvet Underground) and Young took the decision to work with her instead of continuing with academic life.

Writing Young's memoir of his years travelling with Nico Songs they Never Play on the Radio, titled in the US as Nico The End, was published to international critical acclaim in 1993, winning the In The City award for music book of the year. Described by Greil Marcus in Esquire as ‚ÄòA coolly literary masterpiece about the geography of nowhere‚Äô, the book was later serialized in 1996 for BBC Radio 4. Songs They Never Play On The Radio (Bloomsbury Publishing) Nico The End (Overlook Press) This was followed in 1996 by Moscow Mule ((Century) ), a dystopian travelogue situated within and around the Moscow Metro, also serialized for BBC Radio 4 in 1997. Young interpreted the book's milieu in Last Train To Taganskaya recorded for the BBC Radio 3 experimental audio feature Between The Ears. For the bi- centennial of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin in 1999, Young created a sound portrait for BBC Radio 3 Pushkinskaya, of Moscow's Pushkin Square, featuring Moscow voices and readings by Ralph Fiennes. During the period of the early 1990s Young was exposed to the then marginalized world of Russian Outsider Art. He became instrumental in introducing the genre to the West, chiefly through articles in the magazine Raw Vision. 2000 to present Young's 2003 release joanna is to date his only solo unaccompanied album. A portrait of his battered old upright piano, it was described in The Guardian as ‚Äòa hymn of devotion that both dignifies and delights in his old piano's imperfections.‚Äô Coinciding with the release of joanna, a period of illness (adhesive capsulitis) affected the use of Young's arms and prevented him from performing. In 2006 Young was invited to co-curate the exhibition The Fabric of Myth at Compton Verney Warwickshire.

The system worked but was not further developed. Design and development Ren√© Hirsch had been working on aerodynamic methods that would stabilize an aircraft meeting a gust since 1936 and had set up a company to this end, Moyens a√©rodynamiques de regulation et de contr√¥le (MA√©RC) (). Making its first flight on 15 June 1954, the H.100 incorporated the results of his research but was MA√©RC's only aircraft. Control systems apart, the H.100 was a fairly conventional twin engine, wooden aircraft, with a cantilever low wing of trapezoidal plan. The fuselage was strikingly clean aerodynamically, with only gradual changes of cross-section from nose to tail. Behind the pilot's transparency there were three starboard and two port side windows. The horizontal surfaces, mounted on top of the fuselage, had both a high aspect ratio and marked dihedral. Originally the vertical tail was rounded and quite small but during development a large, straight tapered ventral fin was added. The H.100 had a tall, rearward retracting tricycle undercarriage. The main legs retracted into extensions of the engine fairings beyond the wing trailing edge. Little detail about the stabilization system is recorded. It is known that the horizontal tail surfaces were hinged to allow the dihedral to change and that such motions were coupled to lift-changing flaps. Together, these stabilized pitch. The wing tips could rotate to control roll. The system was pneumatically powered and could be turned on and off in flight to test its efficiency. On its first flight and for early tests, the H.100 was powered by two R√©gnier 4EO four cylinder inverted air-cooled engines. The aircraft was damaged in a take-off accident on 3 September 1955 and during a prolonged rebuild the R√©gnier's were replaced with much more powerful Lycoming O-360 flat-four engines. It flew with these engines in 1962. Test flights reportedly showed satisfactory results but, with investment lacking, nothing further resulted. The H.100 made its last flight on 16 June 1971, having flown for a total of 130 hours. In that year it was donated to the Mus√©e de l'Air et de l'Espace, at Le Bourget, Paris, It remained on display there in 2009.

Built in 1886-87 and enlargeed in 1910-11, it is an architecturally distinctive blend of Shingle and Queen Anne styles. Its original construction was designed by William Augustus Bates, a New York City-area architect, for Samuel and Annie Downs, teachers at the Abbot Academy of Andover, Massachusetts. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Description and history Edgecliff is located east of the village center of Southwest Harbor on Clark Point, a peninsula that projects into Somes Sound, the body of water that divides Mount Desert Island into two lobes. The house stands about from the eastern shore, facing the water. It is a two-story wood frame structure, rectangular in shape except for an east- facing projecting bay, and a single-story wraparound porch. The exterior is finished in wooden clapboards and shingles, with relatively plain wooden trim elements. There is a line of flared siding separating the first and second levels. The roofline is complex, punctuated with dormers, gables, and projecting bays. Portions of the building foundation have been covered in shingles, while others are covered by latticework with viny plantings growing on them. The interior is relatively simply decorated, with crown molding throughout both public and private spaces, and slightly more detailed door and window molding in the public spaces. The house was commissioned by Samuel and Annie Downs, both teachers at Abbot Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. They had built a small cottage elsewhere on Clark Point in 1882-83, and were one of the first summer visitors to build a permanent summer home in the area. They hired William Augustus Bates, a New York City-area architect known for his summer houses, to design a larger house for that property, This resulted in the first stage of construction of Edgecliff in 1886-87, at the location of the first cottage. After Samuel Downs died in 1909, the house was purchased by Schuyler Clark, who moved it to its present location, and had it enlarged with a two-story addition to the north and increased porch space. This work, designed by an as-yet unidentified architect, improved the internal layout of the building, and gave it more Queen Anne touches than the predominantly Shingle-style building the Downses had built. The house remained in Clark family hands until 1970.

O'Brien. Published in 1968, it was his first novel. Plot summary The story is in the third person limited perspective, showing events as experienced by the protagonist, Ellen Carroll. The book opens when Ellen discovers a mysterious silver crown in her bedroom on her tenth birthday. This initiates a series of events which at first seem unrelated. Later that morning, her house burns down while she is out at the park and she witnesses a murder. Thrown on her own resources by the loss of her family, Ellen decides to hitchhike to her Aunt Sarah in Kentucky. On the way, she escapes from a kidnapper, is chased though the woods, and finds an ally in 8-year-old Otto. With Otto, she treks through the mountains, while being hunted by sinister men. At a black castle in the forest, Ellen encounters a medieval device called the Hieronymus Machine which is mind-controlling people and turning them into arsonists and assassins for an unknown purpose. The machine can be operated by two crowns, one black and one silver. It seems that only Ellen can activate the silver crown, the more powerful of the two. Ellen decides the Machine is too dangerous and, despite the temptation of becoming a queen, has it destroyed. Revised final chapter In the original version, one of the adult characters speculates that the Machine was responsible for sending the crown to Ellen and arranged events to draw her to the castle. This explanation ties up loose ends for the reader. O'Brien later revised the ending of the novel for the British edition to eliminate this section; Ellen's Aunt Sarah simply says she found the crown at \\"a little curio shop in Barcelona,\\" with no apparent link to the Hieronymus Machine.Note to 2001 edition of The Silver Crown, p. 318. Influences The \\"Hieronymus\\" in the book is a reference to St. Jerome; in the book's invented history, some of his followers drifted into occult sciences and built the Hieronymus Machine \\"many centuries ago in a monastery in Spain.\\"The Silver Crown, p. 252 (Later, though, it was stated to be built by another Hieronymus c. 1000 AD, centuries after the actual St. Jerome.)The Silver Crown, p. 310 There is no basis for this in actual history. An American inventor Thomas Galen Hieronymus built a machine which he named a \\"Hieronymus machine\\" in 1949. (This is the same year given in the novel for the discovery of the device by an archaeologist in Spain.) However, his machine merely detected radiation supposedly emitted by all living things; it had nothing to do with mind control. Reception Kirkus Reviews stated \\"That Mr. Arthur's nightmare of thought control requires eight pages of explanation at the end is symptomatic of a fundamental failure... much of what happens to her [Ellen] seems, even in retrospect, unnecessarily outlandish, and the connection with actuality is crude.\\" However, Andre Norton Award winner E. C. Myers said about The Silver Crown: \\"It may have been one of the first stories I read that straddled the line between fantasy and science fiction and deftly subverted readers' expectations\\" and \\"he left a lasting impression on generations of readers.\\" References Category:1968 American novels Category:American children's novels Category:American fantasy novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Children's science fiction novels Category:1968 science fiction novels Category:1968 children's books Category:1968 debut novels ","title":"The Silver Crown"},{"id":"45268288","text":"OpenStudio is a suite of free and open-source software applications for building energy analysis used in building information modeling.OpenStudio project, GitHub OpenStudio applications run on Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, and Linux platforms.OpenStudio HomepageLegacy OpenStudio Plug-in for SketchUp, EnergyPlus Simulation Software, US Department of Energy Its primary application is a plugin for SketchUp, that enables engineers to view and edit 3D models for EnergyPlus simulation software.OpenStudio Application Suite, EnergyPlus Simulation Software, US Department of EnergyOpenStudio Training, PSD ConsultingGreen Building's Open-Source Push, Bloomberg BusinessNREL Software Could Cut Commercial Building Energy Audit Costs 75%, CleanTechnicaGoogle SketchUp 'plug-in' offers energy analysis, CnetNational Renewable Energy Laboratory Offers Free Energy Conservation Software for Buildings, CleanTechnicaASHRAE, DOE Update Green Building Guides, Software, EnvironmentalLeader OpenStudio was first released in April 2008 by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a part of the U.S. Department of Energy.Free software for energy-efficient building design, ConstructionWeekOnline.com NREL reports an average of 700 OpenStudio downloads per month.

If bullying endangers a worker's health causing stress or any other physical harm, a corporation can be found liable for not providing a safe place for their employees to work.Worksafe, Victorian Workcover Authority  Canada  = Quebec = The Canadian Province of Quebec passed legislation addressing workplace bullying on 1 June 2004. In its act representing labour standards, \\"psychological harassment\\" is prohibited. The Commission des normes du travail is the organization responsible for the application of this act. = Ontario = Under the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act 1979, all employers \\"take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of a worker\\". This includes protecting them against the risk of workplace violence.Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act 1979 Ministry of Labour, Ontario, Canada The Act requires establishment of Joint Occupational Health and Safety Committees for larger employers. Under the act, workplace violence is defined as \\"...the attempted or actual exercise of any intentional physical force that causes or may cause physical injury to a worker. It also includes any threats which give a worker reasonable grounds to believe he or she is at risk of physical injury\\".Workplace Violence Ministry of Labour, Ontario, Canada Currently, as the Act is written, the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act does not specifically cover the issue of psychological harassment. On 13 December 2007, MPP Andrea Horwath introduced for first reading a new Bill, Bill-29, to make an amendment to the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act. This Bill-29 is proposing \\"to protect workers from harassment and violence in the workplace\\" and will include protection from psychological abuse and bullying behaviors in the workplace in Ontario. The Ontario OHS Act has been amended to include Bill 168, which came into force 15 June 2010. The amendment includes the protection of employees from psychological harassment, workplace violence, including domestic violence in the workplace. = Saskatchewan = The Canadian Province of Saskatchewan made workplace bullying illegal in 2007 by passing The Occupational Health and Safety (Harassment Prevention) Amendment Act, 2007.

The Code notes the provision in the Safety, Health and Welfare Act 2005 requiring employers to manage work activities to prevent improper conduct or behaviour at work. The Code of Practice provides both employer and employee with the means and the machinery to identify and to stamp out bullying in the workplace in a way which benefits all sides.  Spain  In Spain, within the public administration, activities including preventing access to opportunities, physical or social isolation, withholding necessary information, keeping the target out of the loop, ignoring or excluding, if permanent and for a long time, are considered labor harassment and have to be prosecuted.Article Mantener a un funcionario desocupado ser√° acoso laboral in Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s on 4. June 2011. Retrieved 4. June 2011, in Spanish Language  Sweden  Workplace bullying in Sweden is covered by the Ordinance of the Swedish National Board of Occupational Safety and Health containing Provisions on measures against Victimization at Work, which defines victimisation as \\"...recurrent reprehensible or distinctly negative actions which are directed against individual employees in an offensive manner and can result in those employees being placed outside the workplace community\\".Ordinance of the Swedish National Board of Occupational Safety and Health containing Provisions on measures against Victimization at Work AFS 1993:17 Official English translation The act places the onus on employers to plan and organise work so as to prevent victimisation and to make it clear to employees that victimisation is not acceptable. The employer is also responsible for the early detection of signs of victimisation, prompt counter measures to deal with victimisation and making support available to employees who have been targeted.  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, although bullying is not specifically mentioned in workplace legislation, there are means to obtain legal redress for bullying. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997Protection from Harassment Act 1997 is a recent addition to the more traditional approaches using employment-only legislation. Notable cases include Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust wherein it was held that an employer is vicariously liable for one employee's harassment of another, and Green v DB Group Services (UK) Ltd,[2006] EWHC 1898 where a bullied worker was awarded over ¬£800,000 in damages. In the latter case, at paragraph 99, the judge Mr Justice Owen said \\"I am satisfied that the behaviour amounted to a deliberate and concerted campaign of bullying within the ordinary meaning of that term.\\" Bullying behaviour breaches other UK laws. An implied term of every employment contract in the UK is that parties to the contract have a (legal) duty of trust and confidence to each other. Bullying, or an employer tolerating bullying, typically breaches that contractual term. Such a breach creates circumstances entitling an employee to terminate his or her contract of employment without notice, which can lead to a finding by an Employment Tribunal of unfair dismissal, colloquially called constructive dismissal. An employee bullied in response to asserting a statutory right can be compensated for the detriment under Part V of the Employment Rights Act 1996, and if dismissed, Part X of the same Act provides that the dismissal is automatically unfair. Where a person is bullied on grounds of sex, race or disability et al., it is outlawed under anti-discrimination laws. It was argued, following the obiter comments of Lord Hoffmann in Johnson v Unisys Ltd in March 2001,Judgments ‚Äì Johnson (A.P.) v. Unisys Limited, Uk Parliament ‚Äì PublicationsJohnson v Unisys Ltd [2001] IRLR 279 House of Lords, Case Summaries, Equal Opportunities Commission, UK that claims could be made before an Employment Tribunal for injury to feelings arising from unfair dismissal. It was re-established that this was not what the law provided, in Dunnachie v Kingston upon Hull City Council, July 2004 wherein the Lords confirmed that the position established in Norton Tool v Tewson in 1972, that compensation for unfair dismissal was limited to financial loss alone. The compensatory award element for \\"ordinary\\" unfair dismissal is subject to a statutory cap set, from February 2014, at the lower of ¬£76574 or 12 months gross pay. Discriminatory dismissal continues to attract compensation for injury to feelings and financial loss, and there is no statutory cap. Access to justice in the UK is via self-representation at a tribunal, via a no-win no-fee lawyer, or via insurance or trade union lawyers. Since the Access to Justice act, \\"collective conditional fees\\" have blurred the distinction causing controversy for example in the case of Unison v Jervis.  United States  In the United States, comprehensive workplace bullying legislation has not been passed by the federal government or by any US state, but since 2003 many state legislatures have considered bills. , 16 US states have proposed legislation; these are: These workplace bullying bills would typically have allowed employees to sue their employers for creating an \\"abusive work environment\\", and most have been supported by the notion that laws against workplace bullying are necessary to protect public health. Many of the above bills are based upon the proposed Healthy Workplace Bill. This proposed bill contains several restrictive provisions not found in workplace anti-bully legislation adopted in other countries. Despite the lack of any federal or state law specifically on workplace bullying, some targets of bullying have prevailed in lawsuits that allege alternative theories, such as Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress and Assault. Although most US states operate primarily under the doctrine of at-will employment (which, in theory, allows an employer to fire an employee for any reason or no reason at all), American workers have gained significant legal leverage through discrimination and harassment laws, workplace safety laws, union-protection laws. etc., such that it is illegal under federal and most states' laws to fire employees for many reasons. For example, these employment laws typically forbid retaliation for good faith complaints or the exercise of legal rights such as the right to organize a union. Discrimination and harassment laws enable employees to sue for creating a \\"hostile work environment\\", which can include bullying, but the bullying/hostility usually is tied in some way to a characteristic protected under the discrimination/harassment law, such as race, sex, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, etc.  South Korea  People can take legal action if specific action of workplace bullying is violated existing law or if it is recognized that laborer who is bullied in workplace suffer industrial accident, but generally it is hard to confirm whether it is illegal or not. Fundamentally, industrial accident can be approved when the accident have task correlation. However, it is hard to say that bullying is related with work. Besides bullying could be occurred in diverse places such as cafeteria, commuting bus, get -together so the task correlation is not likely to be approved. There is, however, a case about recognition of industrial accident related with workplace bullying. The court said that if laborer received treatment due to workplace bullying, it is an industrial accident and the person can take legal action.

It was released on Mercury Records in 1970. Background She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye was Lewis's sixth album for Mercury since his 1968 comeback album Another Place, Another Time. Lewis was also in competition with himself, as Shelby Singleton, who had bought the entire Sun Records catalog from Sam Phillips on July 1, 1969, began releasing albums featuring unheard recordings by Lewis, many of them country songs, to capitalize on Jerry Lee's revitalized commercial appeal. As country music historian Colin Escott recounts in his essay for the 1986 Bear Family retrospective The Killer: The Smash/Mercury Years, \\"Singleton continued to release titles from the old Sun catalog (sometimes with new overdubs) as though they were current product, usually timing the releases so that they appeared just as Jerry's new smash single had peaked...Singleton began programming albums with vague themes, using contemporary photos wherever possible to create the illusion that these might be new recordings.\\" Consequently, the market was flooded with product, turning Lewis into one of the most in-demand country artists in the business. Recording and composition By the dawn of the new decade, Lewis had scored five straight Top 5 country hits for Smash in less than two years (including the chart topper \\"To Make Love Sweeter For You\\"), and his streak continued with \\"She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye,\\" which made it all the way to number 2. The song had been co-written by Mickey Newbury, who would become best known for his arrangement of \\"An American Trilogy,\\" later made famous by Elvis Presley, but it was Lewis who had been the first major artist to cover one of Newbury's compositions, having recorded \\"Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)\\" for his 1967 album Soul My Way. Lewis's vocal on \\"She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye\\" has been widely praised, with biographer Rick Bragg opining in Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story, \\"Some songs make people think they were written for them. This is the opposite: in this song, it's as if Jerry were living inside the lyrics.\\" In the book Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost and Found, producer Jerry Kennedy marvelled to Joe Bonomo, \\"He learned 'She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye' and did that cut of it after hearing the song one time. He really is a genius.\\" The album also features the top 5 hit \\"Once More with Feeling,\\" which was written by Kris Kristofferson and Shel Silverstein. Bonomo quotes Kristofferson: \\"I consider Jerry Lee Lewis one of the great singers of all time. Put him up there with opera singers. He had a way of transforming my songs into something I couldn't believe I was hearing.\\" The album continues with the winning formula established on Lewis's recent country albums like Another Place, Another Time and She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left Of Me), pairing Jerry Lee's unmistakable piano playing and soulful vocals with top shelf Nashville musicians on a mixed bag of honky-tonk drinking songs and sad ballads. As on those two previous albums, Lewis covers a Merle Haggard song, this time the blue collar anthem \\"Workin' Man Blues\\" (\\"Down in Lou'siana,\\" he adlibs during the instrumental break, \\"we call that boogie woogie!\\") and pays tribute to one of his musical heroes, Jimmie Rodgers, on the song \\"Waiting for a Train.\\" However, Lewis's rock and roll roots also began showing through on several cuts, with AllMusic noting: \\"He had been riding high on his new hits - so successful that new collections of his Sun singles made it to the country Top Ten - and took that as encouragement to do whatever he damn well pleased on this new record. So, he cut pure rock & roll (a thundering cover of \\"Brown Eyed Handsome Man\\"), inserted his name in every other song (in every verse on \\"Since I Met You Baby,\\" where he manages to find a place to say his full name), laughed and leered, growled and crooned, pounding and gliding down the keyboard in equal measure.\\" According to the liner notes for the 2006 collection A Half Century of Hits, Kennedy didn‚Äôt dare release an uptempo single because he couldn't risk radio programmers declaring that Lewis was returning to his rockabilly past, so up-tempo songs like \\"Workin‚Äô Man Blues\\" were consigned to LPs. Although Kennedy liked to record in closed sessions, he eventually came to appreciate that Lewis needed an audience: ‚ÄúBad as I hated it, he did better with a crowd. I can remember 70 or 80 people in the control room and standing around the studio. One time we almost had a song nailed and there was a thunk right at the end. Some guy had left the studio and slammed the door. The engineer went down and was chewing him out. 'Why‚Äôd you do that?' The guy said, 'The ice in Jerry‚Äôs drink was melting.'\\" The ease with which Lewis conveyed these often bitterly sad country songs came as no surprise to him, as he explained in the 1990 documentary The Jerry Lee Lewis Story: \\"I am a rock and roll artist and I can cover the other country-type territory if I have to sneak in the back door...If you wanna be an ass-dragging hillbilly singer, you can be one if you really want to.\\" Reception She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye was released in January 1970 and rose to number 9 on the Billboard country album charts. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic calls the album \\"the fieriest, loosest performances he's given since leaving Sun (not counting, of course, the then-unreleased Star Club live recording), which jolts the hardcore country of Another Place and She Still Comes Around to a different stratosphere. Those were spectacular pure country records by any measure, but this is a spectacular pure Jerry Lee country record, where he's the center of every cut, every performance, and the record is tremendously addictive for it.\\" In 2009, Lewis biographer Joe Bonomo echoed these sentiments, writing that \\"Jerry Lee's last pure country record is the apex of his resurgence...Even Another Place, Another Time and She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left Of Me) fall short of the kind of devotions to the rich traditions and history of honky-tonk music that this album reveals.\\" Track listing Personnel *Bass - Bob Moore *Drums - Buddy Harman *Fiddle - Kenny Lovelace *Guitar - Ray Edenton, Jerry Kennedy, Jerry Shook, Chip Young *Organ - Hargus \\"Pig\\" Robbins *Piano - Jerry Lee Lewis *Steel Guitar - Ned Davis Category:1970 albums Category:Jerry Lee Lewis albums Category:Albums produced by Jerry Kennedy Category:Mercury Records albums ","title":"She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye (album)"},{"id":"45268436","text":"Major General Charles Sumner Lund Hertzberg (12 June 1886 ‚Äì 10 January 1944) was a prominent engineer and senior commander in the Canadian Army during the Second World War. Hertzberg commanded the Royal Canadian Engineering Corps as Chief Engineer, First Canadian Army. He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath, and died at age 57 after contracting smallpox on a special assignment in India. Early life and family Charles Hertzberg was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on 12 June 1886, to Anton Lund Hertzberg and Helen Eliza Hertzberg. He had two brothers - Major General H.F.H. Hertzberg, CB, CMG, DSO, MC of the Canadian Engineers and Lieutenant O. P. Hertzberg, MC of the C.R.T. He was descended from a distinguished military family in Norway, and was the great-grandson of Niels Hertzberg. Hertzberg was educated at St. Andrew's College in Aurora, Ontario, between 1899 and 1901 before earning an engineering degree at University of Toronto in 1905. He joined 2nd Field Company Canadian Engineers (CE) in 1902, and was commissioned in 1904. Before heading overseas to fight in the First World War, Hertzberg worked as a consulting engineer a career he continued post-war. His brother, H.F.H. Hertzberg, also reached the rank of Major General. The Hertzbergs were the only brother-duo to hold the rank of general at the same time in the Canadian army. He married Jessie Alexander Hertzberg, of Toronto. His sons Peter Alexander and John Sumner were born in 1921 and 1924 respectively. First World War and Siberian Expedition Hertzberg went overseas in 1916 and saw action in France as a Captain of the 7th Field Company of the Royal Canadian Engineers. He suffered a severe chest wounded at Vimy Ridge in 1917 and was awarded the Military Cross for \\"conspicuous bravery in action\\" in January of that year. Deemed permanently unfit for any service, he was sent home in June 1917. He then served as Adjutant of the Spadina Military Hospital in Toronto. He managed to make his way back into action in October 1918 at Vladivostok, where he fought with the Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force as a major, with the title of Senior Engineering Officer. Here he fought the Bolsheviks and was awarded the Slovak Republic's Croix de Guerre for his services in Siberia. He served until the Force demobilized in June 1919. Military involvement in the interwar years In the interwar years Hertzberg remained active in the volunteer militia, (he was never a career soldier).He commanded the Second Field Company and later the No. 2 District Engineers in Toronto. He also served as Aide-de-Camp to Herbert Alexander Bruce, 15th Lieutenant- Governor of Ontario. Second World War From 1939 to 1943 Hertzberg was the senior engineering officer for the Canadian Army overseas, forced into relinquishing his command by mandatory age limits. He was the first Canadian to hold the position of Chief Engineer in the Canadian Army. Hertzberg went overseas in December 1939 as Lieutenant-Colonel of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, tasked with commanding the engineers. He quickly rose to Chief Engineer of the division, and then of the Army, with the rank of Major General. During his command he and the Canadian engineers developed technologies that proved invaluable to the war effort. Hertzberg was favored by General Andrew McNaughton and when he reached the age-limit for his rank, McNaughton asked the Minister to grant Hertzberg a special extension because there was \\"no other suitable officer\\" who could replace him. Hertzberg was finally forced into retirement in June 1943. McNaughton wrote at the time: Upon retirement Hertzberg was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath: Hertzberg died in January 1944 of smallpox at the age of 58 while in India. He was on a special assignment developing an innovative form of portable air landing strip. He was buried in the Delhi War Cemetery. The Canadian Military Engineers award an annual trophy in Hertzberg's name. It is presented annually to the Reserve Engineer unit that successfully completes a stand-alone project of significant training and/or civilian or military community relations value. Hertzberg's projects included the Canada Life Building in Toronto, under construction here in 1930. Civilian life and private practice Between the wars Hertzberg built a large structural engineering practice and helped build a number of landmark structures in Toronto, including the original Canadian Bank of Commerce head office, which was at the time (and for three decades) the tallest building in the Commonwealth. Hertzberg co-founded the civil engineering consulting firm James, Loudon and Hertzberg. He then broke away from that firm to form a firm specialising in structural engineering: Harkness, Loudon and Hertzberg, which later became Harkness and Hertzberg, a large and prominent Toronto practice. Hertzberg's buildings include: * The East Wing of the Ontario Legislative Building * Canada Life Building * Sun Life Building * Commerce Court * Fort York Armory Pink_Palace_Toronto_2010.jpgThe Ontario Legislative Building 1Canada_Life_Building.jpgCanada Life Building in Toronto Sun-Life-Building- June-2007.jpgSun Life Building in Montreal Airship_Toronto.jpgThe original Canadian Bank of Commerce building, (still standing), Toronto.
