History and profile Established in 2005 by the MFA Program in Creative Writing at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the journal is edited by graduate students and Chatham faculty. Publication is annual as a quality paperback and twice monthly in its online format. The Fourth River takes its name from a subterranean river beneath Pittsburgh, a city famously sited at the confluence of three rivers: Monongahela, Allegheny, and Ohio. The fourth river, unseen yet indispensable to the city's riverine ecosystem, is actually an aquifer geologists call the \\"Wisconsin Glacial Flow\\". Founding editor and poet Jeffrey Thomson wrote in first issue that the genesis of The Fourth River is the idea that ‚Äúbetween and beneath the visible framework of the human world and the built environment, there exist deeper currents of force and meaning supporting the very structure of that world\\". The journal also takes inspiration from Rachel Carson, the biologist, zoologist, and nature writer who is one of Chatham's most notable alumnae.

The model was made from clay, and fired at a low temperature before it was painted, however most of the paint is lost. El-Amra shows four cattle standing in a row, depicted with black and white markings, with horns turned in and downwards. The head of one of the cows is missing, as are various parts of horns. This model was placed in a tomb, presumably to represent a source of food available to the deceased in the afterlife. At this very early stage of domestication Egyptian cattle were probably used mainly as a source of blood rather than for meat or dairy products. Traces of linen survive on the model, suggesting it was either placed in the grave under a cloth, or completely wrapped in one.

It is theorised to derive from the Latin word 'tympanum' (tambourine or kettle drum) and 'timp√°n' does appear to be used in certain ancient texts to describe a drum. However, the tiomp√°n was most likely a kind of lyre.Darina McCarthy, \\"Timp√°n/Tiomp√°n\\", in: The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland, ed. Harry White & Barra Boydell (Dublin: University College Dublin Press, 2013), p. 987.

The feminine noun \\"timp√°nacht\\" referred to the art or practice of playing the tiomp√°n. In modern Irish traditional music, the word tiompan was used by Derek Bell, after Francis William Galpin's theories, to refer to the hammered dulcimer.

Later, Leslie and Justin Anderson (Justin Theroux), who have been dating for weeks, have another excellent date in Indianapolis. At the end of the night, they decide their next date will be in Pawnee, and Leslie feels pressure to make their date equally exciting. While talking later with Ann (Rashida Jones), Leslie decides to host a dinner party at her home with all her interesting friends. She invites Mark (Paul Schneider), Tom (Aziz Ansari) and Ron (Nick Offerman), specifically excludes Jerry (Jim O'Heir), and asks Andy (Chris Pratt) to work as the waiter. Andy agrees, even though he hates Justin, Ann's former crush, and Mark, her current boyfriend. Ann comes to Leslie's house, and finds it full of stacks of boxes, papers and garbage. When they find themselves unable to clean it, Leslie calls Maria Portlesman (Bonita Friedericy), who teaches cleaning courses at the recreation center. She declines payment and hints she would prefer preferential treatment when Leslie cuts the classes, despite Leslie's assurance this will not happen. When Leslie realizes she has not prepared any food for the party, she calls a culinary teacher from the recreation center. Later, at the party, Andy complains about Justin to April (Aubrey Plaza), who makes Andy happy when she proposes putting chewed up gum in Justin's pockets. Eventually, Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives. Tom expresses anger that Leslie invited her, especially because Ron is romantically interested in her. When Ron impresses Wendy by eating a hot red pepper, Tom attempts to eat a bigger one, but has to run to the bathroom in pain immediately. When Justin starts yawning, a worried Leslie calls in other recreation center teachers to make the party more interesting, including a belly-dancer, a fencer, a caricaturist and an origami teacher. Eventually, an accounting teacher arrives, believing demonstrations are being held to determine which class will be cut, much to the anger of Ron. The teacher gives a very boring accounting lecture, which puts Justin to sleep. The next day, Leslie is before the Pawnee Disciplinary Committee on charges of abuse of power. Leslie calls Justin as a witness and questions him as to whether he enjoyed the party, to which he answers an emphatic yes. Afterward, the committee rules no further action will be taken, mainly because Leslie turned herself in and paid $1,000 restitution to the recreation center so no classes would be cut. When Ann asks why she did it, Leslie said it was to get an honest answer from Justin about the date, under penalty of perjury. The episode ends with Justin encouraging Tom to ask Wendy out. Production alt=A black-haired man wearing a black fedora, a black leather jacket and a green T-shirt. \\"Leslie's House\\" was written by Daniel J. Goor and directed by Alex Hardcastle. It featured one of a string of slated guest appearances by Justin Theroux as Justin, a love interest for Leslie. The episode also featured Jama Williamson in her recurring role as Wendy, the soon-to-be ex-wife of Tom. \\"Leslie's House\\" satirizes government officials abusing their positions of power for personal gain, marking a continuation throughout the second season to feature more topical storylines. Cultural references While discussing how behind the times Pawnee is, Tom said residents are now only starting to become interested in the rock band Nirvana. Tom said, \\"I don't have the heart to tell them what's going to happen to Kurt Cobain in 1994\\", a reference to the suicide of the band's lead singer. Before Tom eats a hot pepper at the dinner party, he sings, \\"This is how you eat it\\" to the tune of the 1995 Montell Jordan song \\"This Is How We Do It\\". Leslie said she was saving an old newspaper because it had the \\"first rumblings of Iran-Contra\\", a reference to the scandal in which U.S. figures facilitated the sale of arms to Iran. Tom visits Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia, to learn more about India when quizzed by Justin. Reception In its original American NBC broadcast on January 21, 2010, \\"Leslie's House\\" was seen by 4.35 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. It was a more than five percent drop in viewership from the previous week's episode, \\"The Set Up\\". \\"Leslie's House\\" drew a 2.0 rating/5 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49. The episode received generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, said the episode was very funny and farcical, but grounded in reality enough to keep it from being too unbelievable or over-the-top. Sepinwall said Mark was funnier than he is in most episodes, and said there was good development in the subplots between April and Andy, as well as the blossoming love triangle between Ron, Tom and Wendy. Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez said she liked the pairing of Poehler and Theroux, but found \\"Leslie's House\\" slower than previous episodes, and felt the comedic talents of Ansari and Offerman were underused. Matt Fowler of IGN praised the episode for its use of a wide range of characters to provide humor, saying \\"Everyone got a chance to shine in this episode. They all took turns giving us a laugh and 'Leslie's House' was a tremendous example of this series firing on all cylinders.\\" Steve Kandell of New York magazine praised the episode's satirical bent about elected officials. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club favorably compared \\"Leslie's House\\" to \\"Dinner Party\\", an episode of The Office, the other comedy series created by Parks co-creator Greg Daniels. However, he said \\"Leslie's House\\" was different in that her friends were willing to attend her party and help her out, whereas in the Office episode, the characters did not want to attend the dinner party held by protagonist Michael Scott. Heisler said the fact that the characters liked each other so much in Parks and Recreation differentiated itself from the other series in a positive way. DVD release \\"Leslie's House\\", along with the other 23 second season episodes of Parks and Recreation, was released on a four-disc DVD set in the United States on November 30, 2010. The DVD included deleted scenes for each episode.

It was translated into and published in English in 1971 by Mayflower Books. It is a series of explicit erotic fantasies of the author in which she has sex with several‚Äîoften anonymous‚Äîmen, women, and her husband. It is written in the third person and the reader sees events entirely through the eyes of the sexually adventurous heroine. The book sold widely and later went on to be adapted into a film. The book had two print sequels, and the film launched an extended series. Plot summary Emmanuelle, the 19-year-old wife of a French engineer, is flying out to join her husband in Bangkok. While on the plane, she has anonymous sexual encounters with two men, the first time she has cheated on her husband since they were married. She arrives in Bangkok and becomes part of a hedonistic community of western expats. She makes two new friends - Ariane de Saynes, a 30-year-old French countess, and Marie-Anne, a younger girl. Both friendships have a strong homoerotic flavor. Emmanuelle and Marie-Anne begin a series of sexual games in which they take it in turns to masturbate while the other watches. Meanwhile, Ariane makes a series of attempts to seduce Emmanuelle, culminating in a sexual encounter between the two women on a squash court which verges on rape. Afterwards Ariane tries to persuade Emmanuelle to return home with her. Emmanuelle rejects her advances, but immediately regrets doing so. At a tea party hosted by Marie-Anne's mother, Emmanuelle meets Bee, the sister of a naval attach√© at the American Embassy. Emmanuelle is immediately attracted to the slender, red-headed Bee, and when the two women meet later by chance on the streets of Bangkok she takes the opportunity to invite Bee home with her. Emmanuelle seduces her and the two women make love, first in the shower and then in Emmanuelle's bed. Afterwards Emmanuelle professes her love for Bee, who is taken aback, having never been with another woman before. They agree to meet again, but Bee does not come and Emmanuelle realizes she has no way of contacting her. She is heartbroken and is comforted by her husband. Marie-Anne, meanwhile, believes that Emmanuelle needs to be cured of her need to associate sex with love. She offers to introduce Emmanuelle to a friend, Mario, an Italian nobleman, who can do this. The two meet for the first time at an embassy cocktail party and Emmanuelle agrees to join him for dinner the following night. Emmanuelle thinks that Mario will become her lover, but Ariane dismisses this idea, telling Emmanuelle that Mario is gay. The following evening, Emmanuelle and Mario have dinner at Mario's house, joined by an Englishman called Quentin. Over dinner, Mario expounds his philosophy of eroticism, which is that true freedom comes only when eroticism is divorced from love. He offers to take Emmanuelle on a trip that will demonstrate this. The three plunge into the back streets of Bangkok. They visit an opium den and then a temple, where Emmanuelle makes two votive offerings; first by masturbating Mario and then by performing oral sex on a boy. Later, having parted company with Quentin, the two return to Mario's house in a rickshaw pulled by a Thai driver (or sam-lo). During the ride, Emmanuelle demonstrates her new-found freedom by removing her top and then fellating Mario in public. They arrive back at Mario's house and he tells her that he is going to take her \\"through\\" the body of the sam-lo. The three make love, the sam-lo penetrating Emmanuelle while Mario penetrates him. As the three reach orgasm together, Emmanuelle screams out, \\"I'm in love! I'm in love!\\" Themes=East vs West Bangkok is portrayed as a hedonistic city which has a sybaritic effect on its western expat population.Arsan, 1971, p.34. Emmanuelle has erotic encounters in settings that represent stereotypes for the exoticism of the East (a massage parlor,Arsan, 1971, pp.69-71. opium den,Arsan, 1971, pp.188-187 and templeArsan, 1971, pp.204-210). Love vs Lust The underlying theme of the novel is the conflict between Emmanuelle's need for love (as typified by her relationships with Jean and Bee) and her innate eroticism (as shown by her anonymous sexual encounters on the plane and her games with Marie-Anne). Mario seeks to address this philosophically in Chapter V of the novel (\\"The Law\\"), arguing that surrendering to eroticism will liberate her. The last chapter of the story shows the beginning of this process, which is continued in the 1976 sequel to the novel. Bisexuality Three of the major characters in the novel - Emmanuelle, Ariane, and Mario - are bisexual in orientation. Although married and despite having sexual encounters with two other men, Emmanuelle describes herself to Mario as a lesbian;Arsan, 1971, p.170. she has a passionate sexual relationship with one woman (Bee), sexual encounters with two more (Ariane and Marie-Anne), and expresses attraction to various others (e.g. a flight attendant); it is also hinted that she has had sexual relationships with women prior to arriving in Thailand.Arsan, 1971, pp.74-75 Mario is described by Ariane as being gay,Arsan, 1971, p.118. is primarily attracted to men and has sex with the sam-lo, but also allows himself to be fellated and masturbated by Emmanuelle. Ariane is married and has had numerous male lovers,Arsan, 1971, p.67. but is strongly attracted to Emmanuelle and makes several attempts to seduce her, including one quasi-rape. History Although the formal date of publication is usually given as 1967, the novel was actually first published and distributed clandestinely in France, without an author's name, in 1959. Successive editions later bore the nom-de-plume Emmanuelle Arsan, who was subsequently revealed to be Marayat Rollet-Andriane. Though the novel was sometimes hinted to be a quasi-autobiography, it was later revealed that the actual author was her husband Louis-Jacques Rollet- Andriane, although it has also been claimed that both spouses may have contributed.Francis Leroi, 70, ann√©es √©rotiques, √©ditions La Musardine, 1999 Adaptations The best known adaptation of Emmanuelle is the 1974 film of the same name, directed by Just Jaeckin, and starring Sylvia Kristel. The screenplay was written by Jean-Louis Richard and more-or-less follows the plot of the novel. The film was highly successful in France and around the world. It spawned several sequels and influenced many similar films. In 1978, Italian artist Guido Crepax produced a graphic adaptation of the novelCrepax, 1978. which faithfully mirrors the plot of the original.

Besides Boeoes Kaelstigen's own releases, they've done several remixes for artists such as Familjen, Tove Styrke, Seinabo Sey, Duvchi, Jonathan Johansson, Firefox AK and Andreas Tilliander. History Tor and Leo first met on a class in rhetoric and quickly discovered their similar taste in music, their love for Giorgio Moroder, futuristic trains and machines that goes beep. When the two, by coincidence, moved into the same apartment complex, sweet noises emerged, echoing over the hills of Ersta in the very beginning of 2007. The project soon came to be known as Boeoes Kaelstigen, based on how the two participants complicated family names were spelled by airline carriers. After just a few weeks, Fasit, the duo's first track had already received thousands of plays on Myspace, support from a number of DJ's from all over the world and was picked up by Swedish National Radio,http://www.sr.se/cgi- bin/p3/tabla/latlista.asp?date=2009-10-10&datStartTime;=23:00&datStopTime;=23:59 and various stations in Australia, the UK, Estonia and South Africa among others.

The Institute aims at identifying synergy opportunities not only in the collaboration between social welfare and health care, but also in applying research and the knowledge generated with this research. THL's field of activity includes: * promoting the welfare and health of the population * preventing diseases and social problems * developing social and health care activities and services THL's main office is located in Helsinki. The Institute also has satellite offices in Kuopio, Oulu, Tampere, and Turku. THL has a total staff of about 935 person-years (2018). THL's annual budget is about 100 million euros, of which about one third comes through funding sources other than the State budget. In addition, the following State institutions are subordinate to THL: state mental hospitals (in Kuopio and Vaasa), and state residential schools. Organisation Doctor is the Director General of THL. The Deputy Director General is Pekka Rissanen. The Directors of Department are Tuire Santam√§ki- Vuori (Welfare), Terhi Kilpi (Public Health Solutions), Mika Salminen (Health Security), Anu Muuri (Health and Social Care Systems), and Anneli Pouta (Government Services). Functions THL functions as a governmental research and development institute which has official functions based in law. Research and development are usually intertwined. Own research generates new knowledge, but also makes it easier to absorb innovations from international science networks, and the institute then applies it for new development. On the other hand, it monitors the welfare and health of the population, as well as factors causing problems, and develops and promotes measures to improve the situation. This work often leads to new research demands. Thus the aim is high-quality research maintaining close contacts to international research networks, but keeping in mind the practical applications. THL comprises five departments. Most of the expenses are covered by the Government through state budget, but about a third of activities are paid from other sources, mainly competed research funding. Important sources are the Academy of Finland, Tekes ‚Äì the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation, Framework Programs of the European Union, National Institutes of Health (USA), and ministries through their own budgets. Total budget for 2010 was about ‚Ç¨94 million, 68% from the State budget, 27% from outside funding sources, and 5% from chargeable services.THL The predecessors of THL have been responsible for vaccinations in Finland for almost a century (see National Public Health Institute of Finland). THL is active in research on vaccines, and also gives recommendations to the ministry to acquire vaccines for the public vaccination programs, monitors adverse events of vaccines, maintains certain statistics and so on. THL also does contract work for pharmaceutical and food industries. A partial source of income is clinical vaccine trials, including funds from the vaccine manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline. The legality of THL's close ties with vaccine manufactures was questioned by some parents and NGOs after unexpected side effects of H1N1 \\"swine flue\\" vaccines in 2009 and 2010.YLE News 17 November 2010: Ties Between Big Pharma and THL Draw Complaints The case was investigated by the Justice Chancellor of Finland, and no wrongdoings were found.Helsingin Sanomat, August 15, 2011 Moreover, the Government and funding agencies have encouraged increased collaboration with companies.Working group appointed by the Academy of Finland, 2005: Long-term and dynamic partnerships.

After the war, he settled with many of the men of the 84th Regiment in Douglas Township, Hants County, Nova Scotia. The British Crown granted land to soldiers after the war to encourage settlement, especially in Upper Canada (now Ontario). Small is featured as one of the central figures in American artist John Trumbull's notable painting, The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker's Hill, June 17, 1775; versions were completed in the early 19th century. Small is shown deflecting a bayonet away from General Warren, who had been a friend before the hostilities broke out. Small returned to Great Britain after the war. He was appointed as Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey and promoted to major general, serving from 1793 until his death in 1796.  Early life  Born at Strathardle, Atholl, he was the son of Patrick Small of Leanoch in Glen Shee, Scotland and Magdalen Robertson, daughter of Alexander Robertson, 5th Laird of Straloch, Perthshire. His brothers were Alexander Small, who became an army surgeon, and James Small, who was a factor. John Small was a first cousin and close friend of John Robertson Reid, who became a general in the British Army. His niece, Magdalen (Small) MacDonald, was the mother of John MacDonald of Garth and Mrs. William McGillivray. John Small and his relatives were members of the Smalls of Dirnanean, and are also related to the Small-Kiers of Kindrogan House. At an early age Small's family purchased a commission for him to enter the Scots Brigade, and he served with them in the Netherlands. He was promoted to 2nd lieutenant in the Earl of Drumlanrig's Regiment when it was raised for service of the States General in 1747. In 1756, Small obtained a commission in the British Army, becoming a lieutenant in the Black Watch just before its departure for North America to fight in the Seven Years' War. Seven Years' War Lieutenant Small went to North America to fight for Great Britain against French Canadian forces in the Seven Years' War. On that front, the war became known to the colonists of the Thirteen Colonies as the French and Indian War, referring to France and its Native American allies. Small fought at the Battle of Fort Oswego in New York. Two years later, in 1758, he fought at the Battle of Ticonderoga, also in New York, under General James Abercrombie. Following the defeat, he accompanied General Amherst on his successful expedition to Lake Champlain. He was with him at the Surrender of Montreal in 1760. In Montreal, Small was placed in charge of the French prisoners and took them to New York. General Amherst had great confidence in him, and frequently used him \\"on particular services\\". In 1762, Small was promoted to captain. He sailed with his regiment to take part in the Invasion of Martinique and the British expedition against Cuba, as Great Britain tried to take more power in the Caribbean during the Seven Years' War. Following the Treaty of Paris in 1763, Captain Small was placed on half-pay. According to General Stewart, he was almost immediately put on the full-pay list of the 21st North British Fusiliers. When the Black Watch left in 1767 for Europe, most of the men of that regiment, who had earlier volunteered to stay in North America, joined the Fusiliers in order to serve under Small. He was \\"deservedly popular\\" with them. That same year, Small was appointed brigade major to the forces in North America and returned there. It may have been during the interval between the Seven Years' War and the American Revolution that Small began to acquire his estate, Selmah Hall, in Nova Scotia. He later bequeathed part of it to his first cousin, friend, and heir General John Robertson Reid. During this period, Small became interested in local politics and formed friendships with several influential Anglo-American politicians. American Revolution In 1765, Captain Small was placed in command of a company of the 21st Regiment of Foot, serving with them throughout the American Revolution. In 1775, he received an unofficial assignment from General Gage. Promoted to the rank of major, Small was sent to Nova Scotia to raise at his own expense the Young Royal Highlanders Regiment. This regiment was afterwards amalgamated into the 84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants).  Battle of Bunker Hill, Boston  Brigade Major Small in John Trumbull's The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker Hill As brigade major, Small fought at the first major battle of the American Revolution, the Battle of Bunker Hill in Boston, Massachusetts. In the course of that day, his life was saved by the American General Israel Putnam. Seeing Small standing alone at a time when all around him had fallen, Putnam struck up the barrels of his men's muskets to save his life. Small and Putnam had served together during the Seven Years' War. Along with three other members of the 84th Regiment, Small was wounded in the arm by cannon fire.  84th Highland Regiment of Foot  Small spent the most part of his time in New York on staff duty. Small was commander of the 84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants), 2nd Battalion. At the end of the war, the Crown aided many of its soldiers with land grants to settle in Nova Scotia and Upper Canada (current Ontario) in lieu of pay to encourage British colonization of the area. They often settled together as units, and the 84th Regiment of Foot settled in the Douglas Township in Hants County, Nova Scotia. (Some members had lived there before the war.) Small also lived there for a time, constructing a manor house called \\"Selmah Hall\\"; the community of Selma, Nova Scotia, was named for his property.Duncanson, Two Loyalist Townships: Rawdon and Douglas Postwar years After the war, Small was thought to have advised American artist John Trumbull on his painting The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker Hill. They met in London in 1786.See Trumbull's Letter dated March 30, 1818 in which he writes about his 1786 conversation with Major Small in London. Trumbull painted Major Small at the centre of the action, holding a bayonet to prevent a fellow British soldier from killing his friend, American Patriot Joseph Warren. (In fact, Warren was shot through the head during the battle and instantly killed by a musket ball). Trumbull wanted to express the divisions that the conflict created between people who were friends, yet were caught on opposite sides. In describing the painting for a catalogue of his works, Trumbull explained why he chose to emphasize Major Small's role. He said that Small, whom he had met in London, \\"was equally distinguished by acts of humanity and kindness to his enemies, as by bravery and fidelity to the cause he served.\\" Later years In 1793, Small was appointed as Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey and received his final promotion to major general. He died on Guernsey three years later, on 17 March 1796. He is buried within Saint Peter Port Church. Small never married. At his death, his principal heir was his first cousin and good friend, John Robertson Reid. He left a valuable estate of four or five thousand acres in Nova Scotia to the general.

There is much talk of the \\"global village\\" and it is often argued that a truly global economy has emerged, or is in the process of emerging. This global economy, it is further argued, in what might be termed the \\"globalization hypothesis\\", has made domestic economic strategies useless in the face of the world market, in which a new breed of truly transnational corporations are the dominant actors. The authors question the extent to which this globalization hypothesis is an accurate portrayal of how things actually are, and whether this is how they ought to be. There is a strong polemical element to the book.  Five important criticisms of the globalisation hypothesis  The authors argue on the basis of the following five interrelated points: # Those advancing the globalization thesis do not provide a coherent concept of the world economy in which supranational forces and agents are decisive. # Pointing to evidence of the enhanced internationalization of economic relationships since the 1970s is not in itself proof of the emergence of a distinctly global economic structure. # The international economy has been subject to major structural changes in the last century, and there have been earlier periods of internationalisation of trade, capital flows and the monetary system, especially from 1870 to 1914. # There are very few truly global transnational corporations (TNCs). Most so-called TNCs are really only multinational corporations that continue to operate from distinct national bases. # The prospects for regulation by international cooperation, the formation of trading blocs, and the development of new national strategies that take account of internationalization are by no means exhausted.  Five important major characteristics of the international economy  Having criticized a strong version of the globalization thesis, Hirst and Thompson identify five major characteristics of the international economy that they wish to emphasize. # The most important economic (and other) relationships are still those between the most developed market economies. # There has been a progressive internationalization of money and capital markets since the 1970s. # There has been an increasing volume of trade in semi-manufactured and manufactured goods between the industrialized economies. # There has been a progressive development of internationalized (not \\"globalized\\") companies. # The formation of supranational trading blocs has advanced considerably in recent years.  Conclusion  Kiani and Schofield ask whether the globalization hypothesis is overstated, or is it the case that we are really in a new stage in international economic, political and cultural relationships. In doing so, they trace out the present configuration of international economic, political and cultural tendencies. They look at the implications of these developments for policy and for the likely future direction of development. They stress, as the title suggests, the importance of \\"governance\\", and the ways in which nation states and international governance might interact with the processes at work. Their aim is to provide a rebuttal to the arguments of those who think that global market forces either should be obeyed, or cannot but be obeyed. Their conclusion is that \\"there are still opportunities for the development of governance mechanisms at the level of the international economy that neither undermine national governance nor hinder the creation of national strategies for international control\\".

It is one of the chemicals responsible for cork taint. Tribromoanisole is a fungal metabolite of 2,4,6-tribromophenol, which is used as a fungicide. It can be found in minute traces on packaging materials stored in the presence of fiberboard treated with 2,4,6-tribromophenol. These traces can cause an unpleasant mustiness in packaged foods. Tribromoanisole is usually produced when naturally occurring airborne fungi or bacteria (usually Aspergillus sp., Penicillium sp., Actinomycetes, Botrytis cinerea, Rhizobium sp., or Streptomyces) are presented with brominated phenolic compounds, which they then convert into bromoanisole derivatives. The bromophenols can originate from various contaminants including those found in some pesticides and wood preservatives. They can also migrate from other objects such as shipping pallets treated by bromophenols. Tribromoanisole has a very low odor detection threshold.

Background During 1794 the British were in negotiations with a French planter, Louis-Fran√ßois Dubuc, who wished to gain British protection, as the then French Constitutional Assembly of the First Republic was busy passing a law abolishing slavery, which had actually taken place in Paris on 4 February 1794. However the Whitehall Accord of 19 February 1794 between counter-revolutionary French colonists and Great Britain, which allowed colonial French slave-owners to maintain slavery, was not signed until after the British had landed. Invasion Thus on 5 February, the day after slavery was abolished in Paris, in what just might be one of world history's greatest feats of precognition, a British fleet under the command of Royal Navy Admiral Sir John Jervis landed troops under the command of General Charles Grey in a campaign which would last six weeks. By 20 March only Fort Bourbon and Fort Royal still held out. Jervis ordered the fourth rate ship of the line HMS Asia (64 guns), and the sloop, HMS Zebra to take Fort Saint Louis.James (1837), Vol. 1, p.218 Asia was unable to get close, Zebra went in alone, with her captain, Richard Faulknor. Despite facing heavy fire, Faulknor ran Zebra close under the walls. He and his ship's company then used Zebras boats to land. The British stormed the fort and captured it. Zebra lost only her pilot killed and four men wounded. Meanwhile the boats of the British fleet captured Fort Royal and two days later Fort Bourbon capitulated. Aftermath The Governor General of Martinique at the time was Donatien Marie Joseph de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau who surrendered to Grey. The British then occupied Martinique until the Treaty of Amiens returned the island to the French in 1802. References ;Bibliography * Fortescue, John.

Purpose  The primary purpose of wall padding is to provide a safe level of absorption for an individual making impact with an established object. Often these objects are walls (hence ‚Äúwall padding‚Äù), but also these pads commonly protect bleachers, stage fronts, I-Beams, goal posts, columns, and fences.  Standard Sizes  Typical indoor wall panels are 24‚Äù wide x 72‚Äù high. In recent history however many newly constructed schools and universities have made a push for 84‚Äù high padding in their basketball facilities, where athletes are often elevated in motion. In grappling and wrestling facilities pads are regularly 60‚Äù since most movement occurs on the ground. Outdoor stadium padding is 48‚Äù wide x 96‚Äù high. However, when working with a skilled manufacturer all dimensions can often be easily customized to fit the unique needs of your facility.  Composition  Standard quality indoor wall panel will begin with a 7/16‚Äù osb (oriented strand board) backer. To that, a layer of foam will be laminated. For indoor panels the standard thickness of foam is 2‚Äù, but which type 2‚Äù foam is laminated to the backer is the most important part of the pad (see foam). After these steps have been completed a 16 oz. vinyl cover is stapled over the face and onto the back of the pad. A basic stadium pad, will spend most of its life outdoors, and should always begin with a ¬Ω‚Äù to ¬æ‚Äù weather durable backer board. Most often plywood is used, but other experienced companies like Mancino Manufacturing use a higher grade backer called . To that, a layer of foam will be laminated. For outdoor stadium panels the standard thickness of foam is 3‚Äù. Foam should be a minimum 1.8 pound density, with a 50-pound IFD. After these steps a 16o oz. to 17 oz. fabric will be stapled over the face of the pad.  Foam  Foam used in manufacturing wall padding is typically a polyurethane based foam, but can vary based on a specification written, or simply customer preference.  Vinyl  Vinyl range from 14 oz. to 18 oz. in weight, and typically has a light leather emboss pattern engrained into the good side of the material. There are at least 16 standard colors to choose from. Vinyl should also be expected to meet fire retardant test NFPA-701 and ASTM E84  Installation Methods  The most common installation methods are; standard method, nailing margin, and z-clip. Standard method is a process in which panels are toe nailed in with a finishing nailer. Most often this method is done by professionals. If the surface the pads are being installed on is capable of being nailed into, pads will often be mounted directly to that surface. However, if the surface is unable to be nailed into, like cinder block, then firing strip will be mounted first, and the pads mounted to them. Nailing margin is a process in which the manufacturer will intentionally leave 1‚Äù of foam off the top and bottom of the panel. This 1‚Äù area is meant to allow the installer to drill directly through the panel, without damaging, or compromising the pad. If the surface the pads are being installed on is capable of being screwed into, pads will often be mounted directly to that surface. However, if the surface is unable to be drilled into, like cinder block, then firing strip will be mounted first, and the pads mounted to them. Z-clip is a process in which the panels are hung with male/female aluminum channeling. An installer will first mount the female side of the aluminum clip to the wall (typically in 6‚Äô lengths). The installer will then mount the male side of the clip to the panel (typically 22‚Äù lengths). To hang the panels, the installer will drop the panel with the male clip into the female clip on the wall. These pads will appear the same as standard method pads on from head on, but can also be removed from the wall because of the male/female clip.  Upgrades  Graphics art work is common upgrade that can be made to most any pad, in the manufacturing process.

Fictional works=Alan Craik series The Alan Craik series of espionage thrillers was conceived on a camping trip in the Adirondacks in 1994-5 and the events of the first book are very loosely based on the activities of John Anthony Walker and his son, father and son spies working for the Soviet Union against the United States Navy. Christian Cameron envisioned the books as a modern-day Hornblower series, depicting the life of a modern naval officer from his earliest career until his retirement. Over the course of eight novels, Alan Craik changes from a patriotic, enthusiastic and driven young man to a cynical and ambitious middle-aged man who resigns as a Captain to protest the use of intelligence to justify bad political decisions. Tyrant series The Tyrant series was born in the classrooms of the Classics Department of the University of Toronto, where Cameron decided to write a series of historical novels in 2003. From 2003 to the present, Cameron has written six Tyrant novels: Tyrant (2008), Storm of Arrows (2009), Funeral Games (2010), King of the Bosporus (2011), Destroyer of Cities (2013) and Force of Kings (2014). The Tyrant series is set in the time of Alexander the Great and concerns the history of the Euxine area and the inter-relations between the Greeks and Scythians. Cameron also produced a single volume fictional biography of Alexander entitled God of War which ties into the Tyrant series. God of War was published in 2012. Long War series The Long War series is Cameron's second historical series, also published by Orion in the UK. Cameron's series covers the Persian Wars from the first-person point of view of a historical figure, Arimnestos of Plataea. The first book, Killer of Men (published in 2010), is named after Achilles, the man-killer of the Iliad, and covers in first person the early life of Arimnestos and his participation in the Ionian Revolt. The next installment of the series is Marathon (published 2011), which culminates in the titular battle. Poseidon's Spear (2013) covers the five years after Marathon and is a more personal tale of adventure, exploration and revenge across the western Mediterranean and Atlantic Europe. The Great King (2014) has Arimnestos partake in Sparta's diplomatic mission to Persia and ends with the Battle of Artemisium. Salamis (2015) covers the titular battle and The Rage of Ares (2016) ends the series with the battles of Plataea and Mycale.

Chivalry series Christian Cameron at a reenactment in Verona Italy The Chivalry series is Cameron's third historical series, also published by Orion (May 2013). Based loosely around the exploits of Sir William Gold, one of Sir John Hawkwood's lieutenant's in Italy, this series begins with Gold's life as a goldsmith's apprentice in London just after the great plague of 1347 and will continue through the Battle of Poitiers and the Savoyard Crusade, as well as the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, right through to the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, covering the history of the period‚Äîmilitary, chivalric, and literary‚Äîin England, France, Italy, and Greece and roughly in parallel with the career of Chaucer's knight. Geoffrey Chaucer is a major character, along with John Hawkwood and Jean Le Maingre. Traitor Son Cycle Originally planned as a trilogy, and extended to a five book fantasy series with an alternative medieval setting. The major story arc takes the Red Knight from the relative obscurity of command of a little-known mercenary company to fame, international renown, worldly power, and confrontation with the real powers of his world and perhaps with his own belief system. Masters and Mages A magical fantasy alternate medieval setting fictional universe, written after the conclusion of the Traitor Son pentalogy, planned as a trilogy.

She was born in Belgium but spent most of her career in France. She became closely associated with the writer Paul Claudel, and she was married to the critic and film-maker Louis Delluc. Career √àve Francis was born Eva Louise Fran√ßois at Saint-Josse-ten-Noode in Belgium. After completing her secondary education in Belgium, she embarked on a career as an actress and began working in the theatre in Paris in 1913. In 1914 she was introduced to the author Paul Claudel who chose her for the leading role in the first Paris production of his play L'Otage. Although only a few performances were given, the play was well received in literary and artistic circles and her reputation was established. Her long-lasting association with Claudel was at times personal as well as artistic, and in later years she described him as the most extraordinary person she had known and the dominant influence in her life.√àve Francis recalls Paul Claudel: an interview filmed in 1973 and archived by INA. [In French]. When Claudel wrote his Paroles au mar√©chal, addressed to Philippe P√©tain after the collapse of France in 1940, √àve Francis gave a public recital of the poem in Vichy.Yvan Foucart. Dictionnaire des com√©diens fran√ßais disparus; nouvelle √©dition. (Domont: Dupli-Print, 2008) pp.473-474. In 1913 √àve Francis met Louis Delluc, then a young novelist, poet and playwright, and a growing friendship led eventually to their marriage in January 1918. It was at her insistence that Delluc set aside his aversion to the film productions of the time and, in 1916, underwent a conversion to the possibilities of the new medium which would define the remainder of his career as a pioneering critic and film-maker.Pierre Lherminier. Louis Delluc et le cin√©ma fran√ßais. (Paris: Ramsay, 2008) pp.28-35. Her own career as a film actress developed fitfully from 1914 onwards, but in 1918 she made the first of several films with Germaine Dulac and became firmly linked with the avant-garde directors who contributed to the movement sometimes called impressionist cinema. When Louis Delluc turned to directing his own films in 1920, √àve Francis took the leading role in almost all of them, including La Femme de nulle part (1922) and L'Inondation (1924). She had one of her greatest successes in Marcel L'Herbier's El Dorado (1921) in which she played the ill-fated cabaret dancer Sibilla. Her style of acting has been described as balanced \\"between mannerism and pose; at its extreme it could be seen as an element of film architecture\\".Dictionnaire du cin√©ma fran√ßais, sous la direction de Jean-Loup Passek. (Paris: Larousse, 1987) p.157: \\"Le jeu d'√àve Francis oscille entre le mani√©risme et la pose; √† la limite, on peut la consid√©rer comme un √©l√©ment d'architecture filmique. Although by the time of Delluc's early death in 1924, their personal relationship was becoming more distant, as his widow √àve Francis took charge of the substantial legacy of his writings and oversaw the posthumous publication of many of them. She greatly reduced the number of her own screen appearances, and during the 1930s she worked regularly as an assistant director with Marcel L'Herbier as well as giving lectures and writing film criticism. In the 1950s she gave support to the growing network of film societies in France (\\"cin√©-clubs\\"), a project which Louis Delluc had first promulgated in 1920. √àve Francis published two books of her own. Temps h√©ro√Øques: th√©√¢tre, cin√©ma (Gand: Enseigne du chat qui p√™che, 1949), with a preface by Paul Claudel, included her portrait of Louis Delluc. She recorded her recollections of Claudel himself in Un autre Claudel (Paris: Grasset, 1973). After making two final screen appearances when in her late 80s, she died at Neuilly-sur-Seine on the outskirts of Paris on 6 December 1980 at the age of 94. She was buried in the cemetery at Bagneux, Hauts-de-Seine.

The Supreme Court ruled that the law of defamation should give way to the rights of a party to speak on matters of public interest, provided the party exercises a certain level of responsibility in verifying the potentially defamatory facts. This decision recognizes a defence of responsible communication on matters of public interest. Background The Toronto Star newspaper published a story concerning the proposed development of a golf course on land owned by Peter Grant, the plaintiff. The stories contained comments from local residents that were critical of Grant, alleging that he was using his political influence to gain permission to build the golf course. In particular, one resident claimed that the decision to allow the golf course was a \\"done deal\\". The newspaper contacted Grant for comment, but he declined to comment. The Toronto Star published the article, and Grant sued the newspaper's parent company Torstar Corporation for defamation. The courts below=Trial court The Court did not allow the defence of responsible journalism to go to the jury. As a result, the jury was left to determine whether the Star engaged in 'fair comment'. The instructions to the jury, however, stated that the defendants would be guilty if the comment would not be held by a 'fair minded' person, or alternatively, would be guilty if the defendants held an honest belief in the defamatory statements. The jury found the defendants guilty of libel, and awarded general, aggravated, and punitive damages in the amount of $1.475 million. Court of Appeal for Ontario Torstar appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. On the issue of responsible journalism, the Court of Appeal found that the trial court erred in not allowing the jury to consider the defence, and remanded the case for a new trial. The Court also found that the idea of a 'fair minded' person would need to believe in a comment was previously rejected by the court, thus the trial court did not properly instruct the jury on this issue. Finally, the Court found that the defamatory comments in the article were attributed to a resident, and unless the defendants had adopted them as their own, the defendants' 'honest belief' in them was irrelevant. Supreme Court of Canada ruling Grant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The court dismissed the appeal and the cross-appeal, with only Justice Abella dissenting in part from the decision. The Court first recognized that the tort of defamation places limits on freedom of expression guaranteed under section 2(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, but that limit should not go as far as to place a \\"chill\\" on expression. It then determined that four issues needed to be resolved: #Should the common law provide a defence based on responsible communication in the public interest? #If so, what are the elements of the new defence? #If so, what procedures should apply? In particular, what are the respective roles of the judge and jury? #Application to the case at bar ## Fair comment ## Responsible communication Responsible communication defence Speaking for the majority, Chief Justice McLachlin found that the defence should exist so as to not restrict speech. She found that the defence helped to strike the proper balance between rights of free expression, as protected in the Charter, and the rights of privacy and protection of reputation. She also found justification in the ruling supported by the emerging recognition given to the defence in other common law states. Elements of the defence First, McLachlin stated that the defence of responsible communication was a new defence, and not a modification of qualified privilege. She then ruled that defence should be known as 'responsible communication', as it is not only journalists who should benefit from the defence, but bloggers and other people who disseminate information regardless of their status in established media. McLachlin found that two conditions must be met for the defence of responsible communication to apply: *The matter must be one of public interest. *The defendant must show that he acted responsibly, in that he showed diligence in attempting to verify the allegedly defamatory comments, having regard to the totality of the circumstances. In determining whether the defendant acted responsibly, she found a court should consider: *The seriousness of the allegation *The public importance of the matter *The urgency of the matter *The status and reliability of the source *Whether the plaintiff's side of the story was sought and accurately reported *Whether inclusion of the defamatory statement was justifiable *Whether the defamatory statement's public interest lay in the fact that it was made rather than its truth (\\"Reportage\\") She noted that this list was not exhaustive, but served merely as a guideline. A court is free to consider other factors as well. As well, the factors should not all be given equal weight. Roles of judge and jury McLachlin ruled that the judge is to determine whether the matter is one of public interest. Recognizing that this may involve factual determination, she nonetheless ruled that the judge was serving as a sort of \\"gatekeeper\\" in determining whether the defence should be allowed. The jury was left the role to determine whether a particular defamatory statement was needed to determine whether a defendant acted responsibly when he published it. Application McLachlin ruled that the three defences of justification, fair comment, and responsible communication should have been left to a jury. As a result, she remanded the case for a new trial. Dissent Justice Abella concurred in part and dissented in part. She agreed with the majority ruling that a defence of 'responsible communication' should be available in Canadian defamation law. However, she dissented as to the division of roles between the judge and the jury. In her opinion, the inquiry as to the availability of the defence was for the judge alone.  Aftermath  The Supreme Court decision was a landmark decision in Canadian libel law. By the time the case was decided by the Supreme Court, Peter Grant's company, Grant Forest Products, had gone into bankruptcy protection as a result of the downturn in the American housing market during the subprime mortgage crisis. Since the property at issue in this case was owned by the company, it was put up for sale to pay off Grant Forest Products's creditors. At the time, it was the largest home in Canada to be put up for sale at 65 000 square feet, with a $25 million asking price. A few years after it was put up for sale, it was bought by a Toronto area company. After that company failed to pay property taxes for three years, the Lake Timiskaming municipal government put the property up for tax sale in fall 2017, whereupon the company paid up the $150 000 it owed the municipality.

He served as the newspaper's White House correspondent, and a correspondent for The Observer of London and the South African Morning Group, from 1963 until 1973, when he became Editor of the London Observer Foreign News Service. In 1976, he returned to the Montreal Star as Managing Editor, with responsibility for all content, and remained with the newspaper until it closed in 1979 after a crippling 11-month printers' strike.\\"Raymond Heard: The Montreal Star, 30 years later\\", National Post, September 25, 2009 Heard then moved to the Global Television Network where he served as Vice President, News and Current affairs, until 1987 when he accepted a position as communications director for Liberal leader John Turner.\\"Paul Martin's climb up the slippery pole - now what?\\", Policy Options, December 2003-January 2004 During the 2008 federal election he endorsed his friend Conservative Peter Kent's winning candidacy for Parliament. From 1990 until 2000, Heard was the senior adviser, media and speech-writing, to two Chairmen and CEOs of Royal Bank of Canada, Allan Taylor and John Cleghorn. As the adviser to Cleghorn during the abortive effort to merge Royal Bank and Bank of Montreal in 1998, Heard played the role of devil's advocate, warning that the merger would be denied by the Liberal government unless the banks did more to explain why the merger would benefit customers. In 2000, he launched Heard-Cosgrove Communications. After Nelson Mandela's death, Heard was interviewed about his contacts with Mandela dating back to 1955, on CTV,CBC, Global and Sun News, and wrote articles for the National Post and Ottawa Citizen on Mandela and his links with Canada. In 1975, the Royal Humane Society honoured Heard, an avid surfer since boyhood, for saving the life of a woman bather at Land's End, Cornwall. The award was accepted by his daughter, Josephine Robson of London,who had seen the woman being swept out in heavy surf hugging a plastic float. Heard straddled the woman over his long surfboard to reach the shore. In early 2010, a consortium made up of Heard, Jerry Grafstein, Beryl Wajsman and Diane Francis announced a bid, which proved unsuccessful, to purchase the National Post, Ottawa Citizen and Montreal Gazette from the floundering CanWest media conglomerate.\\"Group including Jerry Grafstein seeks 3 CanWest papers\\", Globe and Mail, January 18, 2010 Personal life Heard is married to the Canadian journalist, Gillian Cosgrove and they have a daughter, Jennifer, a 2010 political science honours graduate from Guelph University, who died aged 28 in Toronto after a seizure on June 12, 2015. He has two children, Josephine Robson of London, and Antony Heard of Ottawa, from his first marriage to Susan Lewis (now Lady Susan Steyn). Heard's younger brother, Anthony Heard, remained in South Africa and served as Editor in Chief of liberal The Cape Times for many years until he was dismissed after breaking the apartheid laws in 1986 by publishing his interview with Oliver Tambo, the exiled leader of the African National Congress (ANC). When Nelson Mandela became President of the new, democratic South Africa, Anthony Heard became an adviser in The Presidency, serving until 2010. Heard's father George was a popular radical journalist with the Rand Daily Mail in the 1930s and 1940s, who exposed Nazi sympathisers and security breaches in the government-run South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). He joined the South African Navy in 1942, and disappeared in full uniform in Cape Town after VE Day in 1945. It was later discovered that Heard, who was apparently number two on the death list of the Afrikaner Broederbond underground, had been kidnapped and murdered to prevent him from launching a post-war newspaper that would advocate a new, non-racial country.

(died 449) was a general of the Eastern Roman Empire of Gothic origin, who became commander in chief of the East. Biography Areobindus was a Goth who became part of the political class of the Eastern Roman Empire; his son Dagalaiphus was consul in 461, his grandson Areobindus Dagalaiphus Areobindus held the consulate in 506. He took part in the war of 422 against the Sasanids of king Bahram V, with the rank of comes foederatorum, or commander of the contingent of barbarians fighting as allies in the Roman army.According to some scholars, however, the rank was not comes foederatorum, but comes rei militaris (Irfan Shah√Æd, Byzantium and the Arabs in the fifth century, Dumbarton Oaks, 1989, , p. 53). On that occasion Areobindus defeated one of the Sasanids, Ardazanes, in a duel (mard o mard), and, following his victory, the peace was concluded.Malalas, Chronographia, 364; Cedrenus, Historiarum Compendius, 599. The duel is reported also by Socrates Scholasticus (Historia Ecclesiastica, 771), who, however, does not support the idea that the duel ended the war. In 434 Areobindus was chosen by the Eastern court as consul along with Aspar. In the same year he was appointed magister militum per Orientem (perhaps praesentialis), a position he held until his death. In 441 he was chosen by Theodosius II as one of the commanders of the expedition against the Vandals in Africa; the expedition was not successful because its leaders wasted time in Sicily. In 443 he was sent along with other generals against Attila, but he was defeated by the king of the Huns. In 447 he received the title of patricius, but by the year of his death Areobindus had fallen into disfavor with Theodosius II. Areobindus was the recipient of two letters of Theodoret of Cyrrhus, which show that he had lands in that city, among others attested in Euphratensis.

Walker was born in Leek, Stafforshire, England. His family moved to Manchester when he was seven. He joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints (LDS Church) in 1845 when he was baptized by his father, William Gibson Walker. He left England bound for Utah Territory in 1849. He traveled as far as St. Louis that year, but many who he was with suffered from cholera. Walker moved to Kentucky and began to work to earn money to bring his parents to America. He later returned to St. Louis where he served as second counselor in the bishopric of a ward there. In 1855, Walker obtained a job as a teamster transporting merchandise to Salt Lake City. His sister Ann Agatha was married to Parley P. Pratt and so Walker was able to get a job working for Pratt. Walker then became a blacksmith. In 1861, he married Abigail Middlemass, also a convert to the LDS Church and a native of Popes Harbour, Nova Scotia. In August 1862, Walker was called to go to St. George, Utah, as part of the Cotton Mission. It was here that Walker's gift for writing songs was first utilized. According to J. Spencer Cornwall, many said that Utah's Dixie was settled with \\"faith, toil, and Charley's songs\\".Cornwall, J. Spencer. Stories of Our Mormon Hymns. p. 190 In times of death or other distress, Erastus Snow, the presiding church authority in Southern Utah, would come to Walker and ask, \\"Charley, write a song to lift our sadness\\".Cornwall. Stories. p. 190 Walker also kept a daily journal of his life in St. George. A version of Walker's diary was published by Utah State University Press in 1980. This diary was edited by Karl Larson and Katherine Larson. In 1893, Walker recorded in his journal that John Alger had reported in a sacrament meeting in St. George a childhood memory of the account of the First Vision that Joseph Smith had told with Alger present.section from \\"Joseph the Seer\\" This is the last recording of a First Vision account given by someone who had heard Smith tell of the event firsthand. Walker‚Äîalong with Orson Pratt, Jr., Joseph Orton, and George A. Burgon‚Äîpublished the first newspaper in St. George. Besides marginally successful attempts at growing fruit trees and successful work as a blacksmith, Walker also worked as a stonemason on both the St. George Temple and the St. George Tabernacle. The choir at the dedication of the temple sang a song that Walker had written for the event, and Walker was also one of the two witnesses to the first baptism for the dead performed in the temple. Walker was the Assistant City Marshall and a lieutenant in the local contingent of the Nauvoo Legion. He also served as a counselor in a bishopric in St. George. In 1877, Walker took a plural wife, Sarah Smith. Walker had eight children with each of his wives, for a total of 16. Four of Walker's children died while still children and two of his married daughters also died before him. NotesReferences *Cornwall, J. Spencer. Stories of Our Mormon Hymns.

Timeline of events=April 2009Tricia Krause and Tim Janecyk reached out to the Tribune= In April 2009, Tim Janecyk and Tricia Krause reached out to the local newspapers. Tim initiated the tip to her and told her it was Crestwood officials who poisoned her family. She achieved all information regarding the contaminated water from her lengthy investigation. She had done research since 1999 seeking to find answers as to why her children were plagued with life-threatening health issues for now more than 30 years. She had given a journalist several large boxes of documentation of her detailed research about Crestwood. Tricia Krause's records showed that in 1986, after the Illinois EPA had told them that Municipal Well #1 was contaminated, Crestwood officials had promised to start drawing all of their water from Lake Michigan, and to use the contaminated well only in emergencies. Instead, the well remained in use until December 2007. In 2007 the well was tested by the Illinois EPA for the first time in 20 years. The EPA also learned at that time that the well was still in regular use. Residents were not notified of the contamination by the Illinois EPA, the Illinois Department of Public Health or by the village. Although the Illinois EPA claimed that they discovered the \\"illegal and secret\\" use of the well in late 2007, they never notified the residents of Crestwood that they had been drinking contaminated well water for more than twenty years. =Source of the contamination= \\"The most likely source of the contamination is a dry cleaners in a strip mall less than 300 feet from Crestwood's well, just across a narrow, tree-lined creek that drains into the nearby Cal-Sag Channel.\\" The likely source of the contamination also emerged in 1986, when a company that owned the strip mall housing the dry cleaners tried to join an EPA cleanup program. According to a story in the SouthTown Star Newspaper \\"Choong Suk Joo operated the dry cleaners for nearly 30 years out of what was then called Playfield Plaza.\\" The owner of the mall indicated that \\"from his knowledge the family had moved back to their native Korea.\\"In addition, (not one newspaper or news media channel) ever reported that the engineering company that provided reports to the village of Crestwood indicated to hide the use of the well to the state. =The contaminants= Crestwood's public water supply was contaminated with perchloroethylene, or PCE, a dry-cleaning solvent linked to cancer, liver damage and neurological problems and vinyl chloride. PCE is widely used as industrial solvents in particular for degreasing and cleaning metal parts and electronic components, and in dry cleaning. PCE is known to break down in the environment and become vinyl chloride. Exposure to vinyl chloride, a known human carcinogen, can cause a number of health problems including blood tumors, liver tumors, liver cancer, permanent liver damage, immune system damage, nerve damage, reproductive effects. The lowest levels (of vinyl chloride exposure) that produce liver changes, nerve damage, and immune reaction in people are not known. The US Environmental Protection Agency says that vinyl chloride is not safe to consume at any level. The most commonly recognized vinyl chloride related cancers include primary non-angiosarcoma liver cancer, primary brain cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma, and cancers of the blood and blood-forming organs. The non-malignant diseases caused by vinyl chloride exposure are systemic and serious, often resulting in a systemic sclerosis of the body as a whole, and are known outside the United States as \\"vinyl chloride disease.\\" Additional health concerns Crestwood's municipal well is situated within 200 feet of Tinley Creek and approximately 800 feet from the Cal Sag Channel. Both Tinley Creek and the Cal Sag Channel are located within the well's LAI or Lateral Area of Influence if the well is contributing more than approximately 13% of the village's drinking water supply. Tinley Creek is consistently within the well's modeled zone of groundwater capture and lateral area of influence according to diagrams on the website of the Illinois EPA. Although both bodies of water are in close proximity to Municipal Well #1, the impact of the contamination consequences and their dangers to the residents of Crestwood that received their drinking water from the public water supply has not been studied. As of 2006 the Cal Sag Channel was used as a conduit for wastewater from southern Cook County, including the Chicago-area Deep Tunnel Project, into the Illinois Waterway. The Cal Sag Channel was originally engineered as \\"essentially an open sewage pipe to convey human and animal waste downstream.\\" Due to concern over disposing of contaminated sediments, no dredging activities have occurred since 1972. Today, 90 percent of the Cal Sag Channel's flow originates as run off and municipal or industrial effluent, cooling and process water and storm water overflows. The Cal Sag Channel is a part of the highly polluted Calumet River system. > Today, sediments on the river bottom are \\"among the most contaminated and > toxic that have ever been reported.\\" Only sludge worms inhabit the Indiana > Harbor and Ship Canal, indicating that severe pollution exists. The Grand > Calumet suffers from contamination from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), > polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals, such as mercury, > cadmium, chromium and lead. Additional problems include high fecal coliform > bacteria levels, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids, oil > and grease. These contaminants originate from both point and nonpoint > sources. The amount of these contaminants that entered the public water supply via Municipal Well #1 are unknown. The \\"Best-run town in America\\" When Chester Stranczek started rebating property taxes to every homeowner during the mid-1990s, the action was so unusual the National Enquirer declared Crestwood the \\"best-run town in America.\\" \\"America's best small town mayor, Chester Stranczek, mayor of Crestwood, Illinois, is calling it quits after 50 years of public service.\\" wrote Kristen Schorsch - Daily Southtown Staff writer in an article published on August 1, 2007. \\"If you want to define success, you can define in two words, Chester Stranczek.\\" Schorsch elaborated in the 2007 story. The June 2001 edition of the Crestwood Adviser, a village newsletter, is one of several that touts low water rates. Next to a portrait of Stranczek, it states: \\"‚Ä¶ we can save you a lot of time by saying that Crestwood water has passed all the tests prescribed by the EPA during the past year. The results were very favorable, and we have safe drinking water.\\" In an interview with National Public Radio on October 17, 2007, producer Sam Hudzik said: > Stranczek's most proud of his more practical work as mayor. He runs the > village just like the two businesses he founded. That mentality has led to a > reputation as a stern administrator who leads Crestwood and the members of > its elected board like a monarch. With few exceptions, projects he likes get > approved. And nothing else stands a chance. Hudzik interviewed Chester Stranczek in 2007 after he announced his retirement. Hudzik asked the people in the establishment what they thought of the soon to retire mayor. \\"What the hostess, a waitress and the breakfast crowd mention first about Stranczek is the one-of-a-kind property tax refund he arranges for homeowners.\\" The NPR reporter summed up local sentiment concerning Chester Stranczek appointing his son Robert to be the next mayor of Crestwood, one replied \\"the folks at Country House Restaurant are fine with it - just so long as the tax rebates keep coming.\\" Chester Stranczek has not been challenged for office since 1973. \\"I know every inch of Crestwood,\\" Stranczek told the Chicago Sun-Times in 1997. \\"I know every curb, every sidewalk, every stormwater drain. I know all the dikes. I built most of them.\\" \\"As village officials were building a national reputation for pinching pennies, and sending out fliers proclaiming Crestwood water was 'Good to taste but not to waste!,' state and village records show they secretly were drawing water from a contaminated well, apparently to save money.\\" Mayor Chester Stranczek summed up his management style at a village meeting saying \\"I run this town with an iron fist.\\" Nick Valadez, a candidate for Cook County Commissioner in 2010 has a different take on Stranczek's rebates \\"While the village has played politics with the taxpayers‚Äîreturning their taxes for votes‚Äîthey turned their back on public safety. For the past quarter century or more, Crestwood residents have been drinking poisoned water\\" Valadez wrote on his campaign website. Valadez also said on the website \\"Chester Stranczek built his 50-year career on refunding village taxes to voters.\\" Whistleblowers It was the work of two private citizens who became \\"whistleblowers\\" that brought the scandal to the attention of the public. Chicago WLS TV Channel 7's Paul Miencke reported on May 4, 2009 that \\"the story started with a man, Tim Janecyk, who was angry with police and politics in Crestwood after his wife was arrested for leaving their child in the car while she put money in a Salvation Army kettle in 2007.\\" Meincke went on to say in that report \\"Janecyk joined forces with Tricia Krause, a woman who has spent more than ten years trying to convince others that something in Crestwood caused her children to develop cancer. She submitted dozens and dozens of FOIA requests to the IEPA demanding information about possible contributing factors. The IEPA response was \\"you'll never get anywhere; just drop it!\\". Her children have been plagued with various life- threatening health issues for more than twenty years. In 1999, Crestwood resident, Tricia Krause began trying to find answers as to why her three children were suffering almost constantly from a variety of illnesses ranging from viral meningitis, liver damage, acute pylonethritis, atypical bacteria infections, septic, staph infections, organ failure, whooping cough, neurological problems, compromised immune systems, a brain tumor to leukemia. In September 2015; she, in fact, was diagnosed with colon cancer. Her two babysitters were both diagnosed with brain tumors. She eventually found herself in Springfield, Illinois poring over documents at the state's EPA office. She discovered the well water which residents and the state were told was no longer in use was in fact being mixed with Lake Michigan water, sometimes by as much as almost 30 percent. This is the figure they provided to the USEPA federal investigators and IEPA officials. She later learned they used the well every day until the well went dry. It was never 20%, or 30%; it was all the time! The local baseball fields were saturated with contaminated toxic water. She researched for more than a decade, held numerous local town meetings, created her own epidemiological map and investigated every possible contributing factor. \\" Congressman Bobby Rush wrote about Tricia Krause in a press release \\"The government is supposed to protect its people but in this case it appears the Village of Crestwood did the complete opposite,\\" Rush said. \\"Tricia Krause is an American hero for being brave enough, strong enough and persistent enough to expose this environmental travesty and get justice for the people of Crestwood.\\" Janecyk had been looking into rumors that the Village of Crestwood had been mixing contaminated water into the drinking water supply in early 2008. It was a somewhat cryptic posting on an internet website, Topix.com, on July 24, 2008 that affirmed the validity of his suspicions concerning the secret use of the contaminated well. The posting read \\"Is it just me or does the Crestwood tap water taste like its half city water and half Well water.\\" The identity of this poster or their intentions has never been made public. Janecyk learned about Tricia Krause's efforts to explain the illnesses of her children, who were all born in Crestwood, when he did a Google search using the words \\"Crestwood cancer\\", and he contacted her to begin many months-long collaboration to expose the use of the well. It was Krause's efforts that established proof of the subterfuge when she acquired numerous documents through many Freedom of Information Act requests that showed without a doubt that the village was using the contaminated well to provide drinking water for the residents. Both Janecyk and Krause contacted the Illinois EPA a number of times to point out that the village was secretly using the contaminated well to obtain drinking water for the residents. Ultimately Janecyk became discouraged when the Illinois EPA staffer he had been talking to, Shabu Vazha, claimed that it was legal for Crestwood to use the well. Tricia Krause had contacted the Illinois Attorney General's office numerous times and was unsuccessful for anyone in their office to reach out to her. She also wrote a letter to Governor Quinn demanding for an investigation to be initiated regarding the use of Crestwood's well. Krause had written a lengthy ten page letter to President Barack Obama informing him of the atrocious situation. For years I had written Senator Dick Durbin mentioning how sick my children had been. I also informed him about how many children were seeking treatment at our local pediatric oncology ward numerous times. We had more than 400 children seeking treatment. I implored him and all state officials to kindly look into what could be a factor. The whistleblowers then turned to the media and tried unsuccessfully for several months to get a local newspaper to publish the story. After that setback Janecyk and Krause then provided environmental reporter Michael Hawthorne of the Chicago Tribune with Tricia's large boxes of documentation and evidence of the village officials wrongdoing. Hawthorne investigated Crestwood's actions and then wrote the article \\"Poison in the Well\\" which was published on April 19, 2009. Governor Quinn's response The Chicago Tribune wrote on April 21, 2009 > Governor Pat Quinn is demanding answers from the Illinois Environmental > Protection Agency about why residents of south suburban Crestwood weren't > notified that the village had pumped drinking water contaminated with > cancer-causing chemicals for more than two decades. Quinn directed his > senior staff to conduct a thorough review of the EPA's actions in Crestwood. > Among other things, the governor wants to know why the agency didn't invoke > a 2005 law requiring the state to issue a notification when residents could > be exposed to soil or groundwater pollution. The Chicago Tribune made the point that \\"Quinn championed the right-to-know law while he was lieutenant governor.\\" As of January 17, 2009 Illinois Governor Quinn has not made this report public. Quinn said if village officials didn't comply with an order not to use the well \\"they're going to suffer serious consequences.\\" Dan Hynes, a Democrat running against Governor Quinn in the 2010 gubernatorial primary election, said in a statement referring to the Illinois EPA role in the Crestwood water situation \\"I am calling on the governor immediately to dismiss Doug Scott (Director of the IL EPA).\\" Governor Quinn appeared with Illinois EPA Director Doug Scott at a bill-signing ceremony to enact legislation that would notify residents if their water is contaminated. At the event, Quinn defended the EPA chief. \\"Doug's been a good friend of mine, I worked with him as lieutenant governor and governor on this mission...to make sure that we have a healthful environment for every person in Illinois.\\" Governor Quinn has retained Director Scott to run the Illinois EPA. \\"The residents should be notified no matter what. I don't care what the law says, I think its important to go beyond the law so everybody in Crestwood gets a full report about what went on here,\\" Governor Quinn said in an interview with WLS-TV. \\"Crestwood residents deserve an explanation.\\" Governor Quinn also wants to make it a felony to make false statements in the annual reports required by the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. Illinois Department of Public HealthIDPH Statement of August 13th 2008= Publicly, the Illinois EPA states that they had discovered the use of the contaminated well at the end of 2007. The Illinois Department of Public Health issued a statement more than nine months later only warning the public concerning the use of private wells in the area. The statement issued by the IDPH on August 13 of 2008 said \\"The Illinois Department of Public Health is advising residents who obtain their drinking water from private wells in the Crestwood area to test their water for possible groundwater contamination. Routine testing of the city's municipal water wells by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) indicates contamination could be present in the area's private wells.\\" Even though the Department of Public Health states that the Illinois EPA told them about the contaminants found, at this time, neither the Illinois EPA or the Department of Public Health notified the residents that they had been drinking water from the contaminated municipal well for more than 40 years. Though the Illinois Department of Public Health warned the residents of Crestwood in their press release of August 13, 2008 that \\"The risk of adverse health effects depends on the level of contaminants in the water and the length of exposure\\" and that \\"Long-term exposure to this chemical may increase the risk of liver and kidney damage\\" they not only never suggested that the residents who drank from the contaminated municipal water supply for more than four decades should be concerned, they specifically told the residents of Crestwood that \\"[a]lthough the contaminants were found in Crestwood's ground water, Crestwood now receives all of its water from Lake Michigan, which meets U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards, so those using the public water supply are not affected.\\" It is unknown whether or not the Illinois EPA actually told the Illinois Department of Public Health at this point that they had evidence that Crestwood had been using the contaminated well as a public water source for more than twenty years. Based on information presented in their statement of August 13, 2008, it was clear that the Illinois Department of Public Health knew that long-term exposure to the contaminants found in Crestwood's well water presented a danger to the health of the residents of Crestwood. =IDPH will not release details of cancer study= A Chicago Tribune article from December 29, 2009 accused the Illinois Department of Public Health of withholding information on the carcinogenic effects of the village's water \\"Six months after state health officials declared their investigation of cancer rates in south suburban Crestwood was almost complete, they have yet to release the results. The Illinois Department of Public Health, which earlier had failed to notify Crestwood residents that their municipal water supply was contaminated with toxic chemicals, declined to answer questions about the cancer study. The agency also has rejected the Tribune's requests for cancer data filed under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act.\\" The reporter explained \\"In a letter rejecting one of those requests, Damon Arnold, the state health director, had said the study would be released to the public in July (2009). Now agency officials say it won't be officially available until sometime next year (2010), leaving residents guessing if their decades-long exposure to carcinogen-laced tap water contributed to health problems.\\" \\"When the Tribune requested the same data, state health officials said granting the information would violate patient privacy rights. That ruling came despite a 2006 decision by the Illinois Supreme Court that ordered the department to release similar information to another newspaper, the Southern Illinoisan.\\" The Tribune article further elaborated on the Illinois Department of Public Health \\"This isn't the first time the state Public Health Department has withheld information related to Crestwood. The agency previously failed to tell residents they had been drinking contaminated water for years, despite a 2005 right-to-know law requiring the department or the state EPA to notify citizens who could be exposed to groundwater pollution.\\" =ReactionThe Illinois EPA and director Doug Scott Douglas P. Scott, the director of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, the bureaucracy that had regulatory oversight of Crestwoods water system published a statement concerning Crestwoods water supply on April 20, 2009. The statement is on Crestwood's village website In that statement Scott said that even though the well water that Crestwood used was contaminated that \\"the health of the public was never at risk\\" and he went on to say that their use of the well was illegal. \\"For Crestwood residents, it's important for them to understand that, while we believe what the village did was incredibly wrong, that the water during that time period was safe to drink,\\" said Illinois EPA Director Doug Scott. Scott's comment that the \\"health of the public was never at risk\\" was premature as the scope of the contamination and the contamination itself were at that point unknown to the officials and his comment contradicted the opinion of the Illinois Department of Health in their press release from August 13, 2008 (as of January 4, 2010 the Illinois Department of Health refused to release a study of cancer cases in Crestwood that their director claimed was \\"almost complete\\" in July 2009). This caused public outrage and resulted in accusations of a \\"cover-up\\" by the Illinois EPA. In an interview with on April 28, 2009 with Mike Flannery, Scott was asked about health effects of drinking the contaminated water \\"When asked if someone could have gotten sick from the water, Scott said, \\"It's possible.\\" At the town hall meeting held on May 9, 2009 at the Oak Forest Hospital by Congressman Bobby Rush, Illinois EPA Director Doug Scott admitted that he could not say with any certainty that there would be no negative health effects on the residents who drank the contaminated water and when pressed to answer the question \\"would you let your children drink this water\\" Scott remained silent and refused to answer the question. Even after discovering the use of the polluted well the Illinois EPA had failed to notify the public that they had been consuming water from it for more than two decades. IL EPA Director Doug Scott said \\"The Illinois EPA strongly believes in the public's right to know about any environmental situation that could potentially be harmful to them\\" after stronger legislation was passed in part to address his organizations failings in this case. \\"The Illinois EPA has cited Crestwood twice for violating environmental laws, once for using the contaminated well and again for repeatedly telling residents that all of their tap water was treated lake water.\\" Both of these actions were taken only after the secret use of the contaminated well became public knowledge. Prior to this thru a FOIA; the EPA knew Crestwood was using a well they reprimanded them. Congressman Bobby Rush U.S. Representative Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), who represents Crestwood, sent a letter to the U.S. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson demanding a federal investigation. \\"This was a deceitful act and someone must be held accountable,\\" Rush said in a statement. Illinois Representative Robert Rita State Representative Robert Rita said \\"Crestwood residents deserve to know the full story about the safety of their drinking water, while we work to find out exactly what has been going on in Crestwood, we are taking this important step to ensure that no other community is denied the right to know about threats to their drinking water\\" referring to legislation that he co- sponsored in the Illinois House of Representatives as a result of the water scandal in Crestwood. Cook County Commissioner Joan Murphy Cook County Commissioner Joan Murphy, who lives in Crestwood, planned to meet with Crestwood officials. She said the mayor told her monthly and quarterly checks of drinking water came out clean. \\"I've been horrifically upset all weekend,\\" she said. \\"I'm going to have my children go into the doctor and be tested as well as myself.\\" Illinois EPA spokesman A spokesman for the Illinois EPA had this to say to Phil Kadner of the Southtown Star Newspaper: > \\"Crestwood officials told us the well had been shut down and that only Lake > Michigan drinking water was being used,\\" the IEPA spokeswoman said. \\"We > trusted them. They lied to us. We trust public officials to tell us the > truth, and 99 percent of the time they do. What are we supposed to do? > Assume they are lying?\\" Others Shawn Collins, an environmental attorney said \\"Someone (in Crestwood) made the decision that water, other than lake water, could be mixed in and that was an unlawful decision, in my opinion, and I would hope someone will look into who put these families in harm's way. Whether any civil lawsuits result, there should be a criminal investigation into whether laws were broken.\\" Mayor Robert Stranczek's April 2009 meeting Response of residents = In a contentious meeting in April 2009, according to an article on Chicago Breaking News \\"an outraged and skeptical standing-room-only crowd shouted him (Crestwoods Mayor Stranczek) down and demanded to know why local officials secretly used a polluted well for more than two decades.\\" \\"The mayor of Crestwood says the 11,000 residents of his town have nothing to worry about but that's not deflating their fears.\\" \\"Flanked by a pitcher of water sweating as much as he was, Crestwood Mayor Robert Stranczek this morning defended the village's role in allowing chemically contaminated well water to be mixed with Lake Michigan water and fed into residents' homes.\\" wrote Carole Sharwarko in the Southtown Star Newspaper. Mayor Stranczek said the well was used only for \\"emergency backup purposes.\\" \\"There is no evidence that the drinking water that flowed from our kitchen taps contained any substances inconsistent with what the law allows\\" said Crestwood's mayor. \\"At least 200 people attended the meeting. Some defended village leaders, while others demanded to know why officials didn't tell residents about the contamination. Many later said they didn't get a satisfactory answer\\" according to a Fox News report. \\"Residents screamed at the mayor, calling him a liar and demanding answers... many residents called the meeting a waste of time\\" according to a report on CLTV's website. \\"The morning meeting was meant to calm concerns\\" said Channel 7's Ben Bradley \\"Instead it brought a flood of complaints, not to mention anger directed at Crestwood's mayor.\\" \\"Longtime residents are wondering whether illnesses were caused by contaminated water. And town leaders are facing a credibility crisis\\" reported WLS TV. \\"The bottomline is they don't know so I'm upset because we're going to be lab rats for the next 20, 30, 40, 50 years,\\" said Crestwood resident Wendy Brunette at the meeting the Mayor hosted. = Potential motive = At the meeting the village's mayor Robert Stranczek was pressed on his motive for using the water from the contaminated well. \\"Sitting next to an attorney,Not an attorney, the man was actually Dennis Cullerton, the Mayor's new public relations advisor from the Chicago firm of Res Publica. Stranczek denied that the well was used to save money. \\"If it was a money issue, we would have been running 20, 25, 30 percent well water,\\" the mayor said.Documents obtained by Tricia Krause via FOIA request showed use as high as 27% although those are handwritten ledgers kept by the accused party and they are suspect as for their accuracy. Later statements by the Illinois EPA would show that the village actually did get more than twenty percent of its drinking water from the well. Phil Kadner, a reporter for the SouthTown Star Newspaper said of former Mayor Chester Stranczek \\"I think, like many conservative businessmen, Stranczek always believed that environmentalists were full of hooey. It's likely he viewed environmental regulations as a costly waste of time and money.\\" Chester Stranczek was noted to have run the village like a business. \\"Businesses don't become successful by running at a loss,\\" said Stranczek. = A political power source = Crestwood buys Lake Michigan water from Alsip and its leaders have always boasted of its low water rates. A Daily Southtown story in 2005 about water rates found Crestwood's were the lowest in the Southland at $2 per 1,000 gallons. The average Southland water rate was $3.43 per 1,000 gallons. Low water rates were a source of political power for the Stranczek administrations. Officials touted the village's cheap water rates during the four decades they secretly used the contaminated well. Asked why the village did not inform residents of the tainted well four decades ago, the mayor (Robert Stranczek) said \\"there were no violations\\" at that time.\\"There would have been no violations because the IL EPA did not test for volatile organic compounds in Crestwood's drinking water because the village administration lied about the source of the water that the residents drank when they stated \\"all water is purchased\\" meaning Lake Michigan water There would not have been any testing for groundwater contaminants over those two decades because the village, when ordered to test Municipal Well #1, in a letter to the IL EPA said \\"This sampling would not apply to our facility,' because the town's water came from Lake Michigan and not the well.\\" After the meeting, the mayor shook hands with a few residents, exited quickly out a back door and was whisked away in a blue SUV. =Tricia Krause's meeting= The Chicago Breaking News article also reported on a meeting held later that day by Tricia Krause, an environmental activist and the contaminated water whistleblower at a church in the neighboring village of Palos Heights. More than 600 residents attended the meeting. During that meeting hundreds of people vocalized their anger and sadness about the shocking truth of the water. Many citizens stood up and discussed openly their cancer stories. They also told their story of the death of a loved one who had cancer. Tricia Krause had informed them that she requested the Attorney General's office to concrete the well shut. She had confirmed and showed pictures that in fact; it was accomplished. They were told that now they were receiving Lake Michigan water to their homes. It wasn't until finally 2015; Crestwood began to make a serious commitment to rebuild the infrastructure. During the federal trial; Tricia Krause was hired by her attorney to gather information regarding our case. She also worked on the motion summary judgment for several months. This information she acquired was sufficient enough to win our first case. The town of Crestwood was using the well 100% until it went dry. She proved they were not using 10% as the village stated. Congressman Rush's speech Congressman Bobby Rush, himself a cancer survivor, spoke at the meeting organized by Tricia Krause. \\"U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), whose district includes Crestwood, spoke to about 600 people at a church in neighboring Palos Heights. Rush said he sent a letter to United States Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lisa P. Jackson demanding the federal agency come to Crestwood to hold public meetings, investigate the village and test to ensure the drinking water is safe. At the meeting Congressman Rush said \\"Government is supposed to protect its people, It is almost unheard of. It is atrocious. It is shameful. It is criminal for government to knowingly and willfully feed its people contaminated water and year after year lie about it. We are going to get to the truth.\\" Tricia Krause had invited Shawn Collins, an environmental attorney from Naperville to speak at the meeting. He stated, \\"These chemicals did not cause every cancer in Crestwood, but if what happened here - this deliberate infiltration of the water system - caused one, it is wrong.\\" Collins went on to describe the chemicals found in Crestwoods well \\"They are industrial solvents used to do the most heavy duty kinds of industrial cleaning. They do not belong in the human body.\\" Congressman Rush also said \\"You are not fighting for Crestwood. You are fighting for America,\\" The Congressman called US Attorney General Eric Holder from his seat at the meeting and pressed him to open a United States Department of Justice investigation into the actions of the Crestwood officials. =Calls for federal investigation= On April 20, 2009 Congressman Rush called for a federal investigation on the Village of Crestwood to determine if civil or criminal charges are warranted against the municipality after learning more than 51 million gallons of toxic water annually was knowingly pumped into citizen's homes for more than 40 years. The action resulted in a raid nine days later in which more than a dozen federal agents raided city facilities and seized documents.Press Release, Congressman Bobby Rush, May 9, 2009 Cover-up Journalist Gregory Tajeda of the Chicago Argus said in an article he wrote on April 21, 2009 that \\"Crestwood's tainted water \\"cover-up\\" is not a surprise to political observers.\\" Michael Hawthorne of the Chicago Tribune in an article he wrote on June 10th 2009 alleges that there was \\"a systematic coverup of Crestwood's routine use of its tainted well.\\" What no one knew was this was not an isolated incident. A resident at the Mayors meeting in Crestwood yelled to Mayor Stranczek \\"You covered up the evidence.\\" referring to the secret use of the contaminated well \\"This is an intentional poisoning of more than 11,000 people. And they wanted it to die, wanted the story to go bye-bye,\\" said Tim Janecyk, Crestwood whistleblower. Chester Stranczek, Crestwoods former mayor has dealt with environmentalists before. He called incinerator opponents \\"cockroaches\\" and \\"junkies\\" at public meetings, refused to let them speak, had them arrested when they did and used his police department to harass their families, according to Phil Kadner of the Southtown Star Newspaper Those who disagreed with Chester Stranczek on environmental matters previously commented on the former mayors tactics \\"Police parked at the end of our block and watched my children leave the house and followed them outside. It was an atmosphere of intimidation that you would expect to see in Nazi Germany\\" one resident told the SouthTown Star. \\"Mary Schultz was arrested with three others for disorderly conduct by Crestwood police for attempting to speak at a public meeting\\" Kadner reported. Schultz added \\"And I see a lot of similarities between that incinerator project and the water contamination. It's exactly the same mentality as far as I'm concerned.\\" Reporters were also kept away from village meetings in Crestwood \\"I witnessed some of that myself at the time when our reporters tried to attend a town meeting that Stranczek organized to rally support for the incinerator\\" Phil Kadner said \\"The mayor refused to let us inside.\\" Kadner, who is a reporter for the SouthTown Star Newspaper commented \\"as we waited in the parking lot, the police chief, with his hand on his holster, said we would have to leave or he would arrest us.\\" =Mayor's letter= In a letter that he sent to all of the residents and business owners in Crestwood, dated April 22, 2009 and posted on the village's website the current Mayor Robert Stranczek admitted \\"For years until 2007, well water, treated by chlorine, was periodically incorporated into the village water supply during times of high demand.\\" This statement was contrary to the statements the village had made in its annual Consumer Confidence Reports concerning its water quality where each year since 1987 the source of its water was given as \\"Lake Michigan.\\" In this letter Stranczek writes \\"the public's health was never at risk.\\" Congressman Bobby Rush is asking federal EPA inspectors to confirm that claim. When asked about the Mayor's letter to the residents, Congressman Rush said about the Mayor \\"He's lied about so much right now I think the mayor has very little to no credibility.\\" The classification of Crestwoods water system is listed as \\"SWP\\" (Surface Water Purchased) in the state records. Any water system classified as \\"SWP\\" would not be tested by the Illinois EPA for volatile organic compounds or any other of the dangerous chemicals that might be found in well water. Intentionally misleading the state regarding the source of its water would allow the village of Crestwood to avoid testing for common groundwater contaminants.In Illinois a municipality that declares it purchases all of its water from another approved source is relieved of the responsibility of testing that water for the types of contamination that might occur in well water. These water systems would be classified as \\"SWP\\" or Surface Water Purchased and the IL EPA would not subject them to a well water testing regimen. =Former Mayor comments= In an interview with the Southtown Star Newspaper on April 19, 2009 when pressed to make a statement on the use of Municipal Well #1, former Crestwood Mayor Chester Stranczek said he \\"didn't know the story\\" and couldn't talk publicly about allegations the village knowingly drew drinking water from a contaminated well.\\" Stranczek's wife, Diane, said the well supply in question \\"hasn't been used in ages.\\" Chester Stranczek also said \\"I can tell you that it was and is being tested,\\" referring to the contaminated well \\"I can guarantee you the well was being tested regarding IEPA rules and time lines. Even more.\\" Chester Stranczek went on to say in an interview with the Southtown Star Newspaper \\"As far as the water being contaminated I don't believe that,\\" he said. \\"Reports showed it was drinkable. Tests that were taken never showed that we had bad water.\\"Since his administration had convinced the state regulators that Crestwood only used pure Lake Michigan water purchased through Alsip they would not have tested the drinking water in Crestwood for groundwater contaminants =Nick Valadez Comments on Joan Murphy= Nick Valadez who is a candidate for Cook County Board has noted that incumbunt Cook County Commissioner Joan Murphy tried to deflect criticism of Crestwood Mayors Chester and Robert Stranczek for their role in denying and covering up the Village conduct in the matter. Valadez said in an interview with Ray Hanania that \\"Murphy has defended Stranczek and called those who complained about the hazardous water in Crestwood whiners.\\" Prior knowledge of EPA officials \\"Village officials, as well as the state EPA, knew the well was contaminated at least as early as 1986, records show. Twelve years after they were first told that the water coming from Municipal Well #1 was contaminated, the village officials were informed again. According to the Chicago Tribune: > State records obtained by the Tribune show the village was aware of the > contamination on at least one other occasion. In 1998, village officials > were present when contractors tested the well while investigating a plume of > perchloroethylene, or PCE, that had leached into the ground nearby. The PCE > most likely came from a dry cleaner less than 300 feet from the well. In a > letter found in EPA files, the contractors wrote that village officials told > them they still were drawing from the well for a portion of the village's > water supply. Tricia Krause had travelled to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and while reviewing records, she discovered the well water which residents and the state were told was no longer in use was, in fact, being mixed with Lake Michigan water. =Evidence on EPA's files= Tricia Krause had given the letter that the Chicago Tribune refers to was \\"found in EPA files.\\" The Illinois EPA was in possession of proof that the Village of Crestwood was not only lying about the source of their water, the Illinois EPA had evidence in a file since 1998 and they allowed the residents of Crestwood to drink contaminated water for almost another ten years. = 1993 \\"Sole Source\\" Document = Another document found in the files of the Illinois EPA was pointed to as proof of a cover-up by the agency. \\"The 1993 IEPA document that details a survey of the now-infamous well No. 1, which is near the intersection of Illinois 83 and 127th Street. The report says the well was the sole source of Crestwood water, pumping close to 1.3 million gallons a day.\\" Maura Possley of the Southtown Star pressed the IL EPA on the meaning of the document \\"the agency quickly brushed aside the report, saying the sole-source claim was an error, a mistake made by a rookie\\" she wrote in an article on July 17, 2009. \\"The person that did the field work left and someone else picked that thing up and finished kind of the writing,\\" said IEPA's Rick Cobb, the deputy manager of the Division of Public Water Supplies. \\"Anytime you do that, you're bound to make mistakes.\\" The US EPA Raids Crestwood Agents Storm Crestwood's Village Offices = On April 29, 2009, led by Special Agent Randall K. Ashe and armed with a search warrant obtained by US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, federal agents raided Crestwood's village hall and their Department of Public Works building as well as the police department. The South Town Star Newspaper reported \\"A total of 15 EPA agents, state police investigators and members of the U.S. Coast Guard's investigative service unit arrived at 9 a.m. and combed village offices for records until sometime around 5 p.m.\\" Reporter Nathaniel Zimmer said \\"Speaking in the vestibule of village hall, EPA Special Agent in Charge Randall Ashe said the agents were searching for \\"any evidence of crimes that may have occurred.\\" A US Government UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter provided \\"air support\\" during the raid. The authorities spent the entire day removing boxes of paperwork and computer equipment and taking statements from employees of the village. The Chicago Tribune reported that \\"The involvement of federal prosecutors signals a significant turn in the case. Most violations of environmental laws are handled in civil court, and criminal pollution investigations typically are directed at corporations and individuals, not municipalities.\\" Fred L. Burnside, a former EPA agent said \\"EPA special agents are the national experts on environmental crimes investigations, and their efforts have resulted in impressive indictment and conviction rates.\\" Burniside pointed out that \\"In a review of all \\"closed\\" environmental crimes investigations where the Office of Criminal Enforcement, Forensics and Training served a search warrant, it was determined that criminal charges were filed against violators 67 percent of the time. Of those charged, convictions were obtained in 94 percent of the cases.\\" = Mayor Stranczek's Statement After the Raid = Mayor Robert Stranczek made a one line statement about 12:35 p.m. Standing on the front steps of village hall, he said: \\"Right now our drinking water is 100 percent safe and the village doesn't believe there was anything wrong with it prior to this.\\" As a horde of media shouted questions, the mayor returned to his offices. Stranczek would not answer any questions about the village's use of the contaminated well. It is known that the village paid a firm to continue to inform the citizens of Crestwood that there was nothing wrong with their water. = Congressman Rush comments on raid = Commenting on the raid, Congressman Bobby Rush said: > \\"I commend the USEPA for its swift action today. At the request of the USEPA > the U.S. Attorney's Office obtained search warrants for the village. I was > briefed on the raid this morning by USPEA officials after I communicated to > USEAP Administrator Lisa Jackson last week that the agency needed to launch > a thorough investigation,\\" Rep. Rush said. \\"I also requested on Monday that > Atty. General Eric Holder engage the U.S. Department of Justice in this > matter-- and I am pleased to see that they are involved. We want the truth > to come out on this matter and we want the Crestwood residents to be made > whole.\\" The raid on Crestwood was led by the Chicago office of the EPA's criminal division, a little-known group that agency officials in Washington have recently promoted more aggressively. May 2009IEPA statement= The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, wrote on its website in May 2009 that \\"When the 2007 illegal use of the well was determined in December of 2007, the Illinois EPA began enforcement action by sending a Non-Compliance Advisory letter to Crestwood advising against future use of the emergency back-up well found to be contaminated stating, \\"the use of Well #1‚Ä¶is a clear violation of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act[.]\\" =Second class action lawsuit= On May 1 the Southtown Star newspaper reported that a second class action lawsuit was filed against Crestwood. > A second class-action lawsuit has been filed against Crestwood and its past > two mayors for allegedly endangering the public health by allowing residents > to drink water from a contaminated well for more than 20 years. The lawsuit, > filed by Crestwood resident Kathryn Torrisi, accuses the village, Mayor > Robert Stranczek, former Mayor Chester Stranczek and unnamed co-conspirators > of concealing the presence of chemicals in the village's tap water and > \\"unscrupulously\\" causing the tainted water to be pumped into homes and > businesses. =Third class-action lawsuit= On May 2, 2009 A third class-action lawsuit has been filed over tainted drinking water. The lawsuit was filed by former Crestwood resident Diana Delarosa. She lost four family members to diseases possibly linked to contaminated water. =First wrongful death lawsuit= The Chicago Tribune reported on May 15, 2009: John Maan De Kok was diagnosed with stage IV non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2000. When he died, he left behind his wife Michele and their two young children. Maan De Kok's family members had no idea why he had this particular kind of cancer, which is normally found in industrial workers that have been around hazardous chemicals. It wasn't until Michelle read last month's Chicago Tribune report that she linked the contaminated water to her husband's death. =Congressman Rush's town meeting= Congressman Rush hosted a town hall meeting at the Oak Forest Hospital on Saturday, May 9, 2009 where he questioned the USEPA, IEPA & CDC on the Crestwood Water contamination situation. About 400 people turned out for a public forum where federal officials continued to answer the public's questions about the village of Crestwood's secret use of a polluted well. \\"Crestwood residents rally for justice, determine next steps\\" was the title on Congressman Rush's press release promoting the meeting. The official press release stated \\"On Saturday, May 9, U.S. Rep. Bobby L. Rush (IL-01) will host an urgent town hall meeting from 12 noon. to 2 p.m. where he will question the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on why the Village of Crestwood continued to give its residents contaminated tap water despite being warned the source of the water was polluted with a cancer-causing toxin.\\" The press release continued to detail Congressman Rush's concerns \\"participants include USPEA representatives Tinka Hyde, director of the water division in Region 5, and Thomas Poy, chief groundwater and drinking water branch of the agency: IEPA Director Douglas P. Scott, Chief Toxicologist Dr. Tom Hornshaw and Deputy Manager, Division of Public Water Rick Cobb; CDC Senior Environmental health Scientist Mark Johnson of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Citizens will also have the opportunity to question government officials.\\" =Senator Durbin urges study= A May 5, 2009 article in the Chicago Tribune posted on Senator Durbins website reported \\"As federal authorities conduct a criminal investigation of Crestwood's secret use of a polluted well, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin is urging government health experts to study whether anyone got sick from drinking the water. Durbin, the Senate's assistant majority leader, sent a letter this week to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry that nudges federal and state health officials to at least attempt to answer those difficult questions.\\" The Tribune article said that \\"The Illinois Democrat cited \\"the uncertainty surrounding the level and duration of exposure\\" to Crestwood's contaminated water and noted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \\"cannot say with certainty that these levels would not cause adverse health effects.\\" The article went on to point out that \\"Durbin's call for a federal health investigation comes as other members of Congress are accusing the disease registry of consistently underestimating health risks at other polluted sites.\\" He did just enough to appease the citizens. =Water Commissioner Frank Avila= Commissioner Frank Avila of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRDGC) a long time clean water advocate wrote on his blog on May 7, 2009: > \\"Though the case in Crestwood is more dramatic and immediately dangerous > than most environmental issues, the lack of accurate and clear public > information is an unsettling trend. I believe that government officials who > hold information regarding environmental hazards from the public should have > to answer for their dereliction of duty.\\" Avila goes on to write \\"Until we > begin assigning true accountability to the people who hold this vital public > information, until we begin making clear statements that environmental > dangers should always be public knowledge, nothing will be done and we will > be left with no recourse, just a blind hope for honesty.\\" June 2009 On June 1, 2009 the Chicago Tribune reported \\"Legislation inspired by a controversy over tainted water in Crestwood went to the desk of Gov. Pat Quinn today as House lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to ensure citizens are notified when their drinking water is contaminated. The state legislation also would make it a felony to provide false information to environmental enforcement officials.\\" On June 9, 2009 House Bill 4021 passed in the Illinois General Assembly. \\"Attorney General Lisa Madigan today applauded the General Assembly's passage of legislation that requires prompt notification to all users when drinking water is contaminated. Madigan worked with Governor Quinn and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) to draft House Bill 4021, which amends the Illinois Right to Know law. State Rep. Frank Mautino (D-Spring Valley) and State Sens. Susan Garrett (D-Lake Forest) and Emil Jones, III (D-Chicago) sponsored House Bill 4021.\\" Attorney General Madigan said \\"We need to make sure that what happened to Crestwood residents never happens again in Illinois, The law needed to be strengthened to protect public safety and to restore public trust.\\" =Mayor Chester Stranczek's management= The Chicago Tribune Newspaper reported on June 10, 2009 that =Second Wrongful Death Lawsuit= On June 17, 2009 the second wrongful death lawsuit was filed against the Village of Crestwood and former mayor Chester Stranczek: =Illinois Attorney General actionsIAG files suit Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, Mike Madigan's daughter filed a 58-page lawsuit against the Village of Crestwood, Robert Stranczek the current mayor, Chester Stranczek, Crestwood's former mayor and Frank Scaccia, the former director of the water department on June 9, 2009. The suit alleges that the officials not only knew that the water was contaminated and still gave it to the people of Crestwood, but also that the officials named lied to the state, the federal government and the people of Crestwood as many as 122 times. Madigan seeks a fifty thousand dollar fine against each party and an additional ten thousand dollars per occasion of dishonesty. All of the named parties have already admitted to the fact that they used the water from well number one. Madigan insists this is the first step in a long process and does not rule out criminal charges. \\"Crestwood officials violated the public's trust and the laws designed to protect public health. Through this lawsuit, we are seeking to hold these officials accountable for their conduct and to make sure that this does not happen again in Illinois,\\" Madigan is quoted as saying in a statement. Crestwood Mayor Robert Stranczek's office issued a statement saying officials are \\"extremely disappointed\\" by Madigans lawsuit. On March 13, 2010, Maura Possley of the SouthTown Star reported that \\"an attorney for Robert Stranczek has moved to have him dismissed from Madigan's lawsuit, citing his November 2007 ascension to the post - two months after the well's use was halted.\\" Possley went on to write that \\"before taking the place of his father, who was mayor for 38 years, Robert Stranczek served as a village trustee.\\" In responding to the Attorney General's lawsuit, Possley reported that \\"Scaccia (the village's water director)invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination numerous times in his response to Madigan's lawsuit.\\" Attorney General investigation \\"The first that we heard about this was Tricia Krause,\\" said Attorney General Lisa Madigan.\\" Madigan was referring to Crestwoods secret use of the contaminated well. > Madigan's office is currently investigating the actions of the Village of > Crestwood regarding the use of a contaminated well as a source of drinking > water. The office is working to determine what the village did, what the > village knew, and when the village knew it, as well as which environmental > laws were violated. The office is also working to identify the source of the > contamination. When she was asked if there would be criminal charges in the Crestwood case the Attorney General replied \\"Somebody has to be held responsible.\\" \\"A safe water supply is absolutely critical to the health and safety of the people of Illinois,\\" added Madigan. \\"The bill passed by the General Assembly strengthens the law and will help to keep our drinking water safe.\\" The Illinois Attorney General's website says: US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, who obtained the federal criminal search warrant to raid the village's offices has still not made public any federal criminal charges as of June 12, 2009. =US EPA actions= Special Agent in charge of criminal investigations, Randall Ashe of the United States Environmental Protection Agency stated in front of television news cameras and reporters on the day that the offices of Crestwoods public works were raided that \\"this is the first time in history that the United States EPA has obtained a criminal search warrant on another government agency.\\" Special Agent Randall Ashe An article reposted on a website called \\"SierraActivist\\" (originally written on 2.14.2003 by Richard Boyd of The Times-Picayune newspaper) commented on the EPA Special Agent: \\"When Randall Ashe or any of his six agents show up, it is too late for one more chance; it's time to pay the piper for committing serious environmental crimes. Ashe and his agents carry weapons, have arrest power, can obtain search warrants and conduct secret surveillance, and work with federal or state authorities in prosecuting individuals and companies that commit environmental crimes. \\"When we show up, it is too late for more compromise, more negotiating, more one-more-chance to do right,\\" Ashe said. \\"We show up when it is time to make the case, collect the evidence, get the search and arrest warrants, and proceed with criminal prosecutions.\\" Special Agent Ashe's attitude towards environmental offenders is summed up in a quote from a USEPA news release from 2.5.09 EPA Special Agent in Charge Randall K. Ashe said, \\"People who cheat on environmental laws to save money need to know that we will investigate them and prosecute them to the full extent of the law.\\" Feds Raid Crestwood's engineering firm According to a June 25, 2009 report by Chicago's WGN radio: > Federal agents raided the offices of Crestwood's engineering firm, the > latest step in a criminal investigation into the Cook County suburb's secret > use of a community well contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals. Randy > Chastain, president of Burke Engineering, 18330 Distinctive Dr., Orland > Park, confirmed that investigators from the U.S. Environmental Protection > Agency served a search warrant obtained by U.S. Atty. Patrick Fitzgerald's > office. The agents left with boxes of engineering diagrams and other records > related to the firm's work for Crestwood. \\"We're cooperating,\\" Chastain > said. \\"We offered them everything we have on record.\\" The IEPA's recently released report on Crestwood's drinking water did say that harmful chemicals were detected near the suspected source of the well's contamination, a dry-cleaning business located about 300 feet from the well.Not one newspaper or news channel reported information that the engineering company for the village of Crestwood was also involved in the debacle. August 2009Legislation= Illinois' Governor Pat Quinn, reacting to public outrage, signed House Bill 4021 into law in August 2009 addressing many of the legal issues that grew out of the contaminated water scandal in Crestwood. WLS TV's Paul Miencke reported on August 23, 2009Tricia Krause proposed the bill to incur a 50 year sentence of jail time so that there would never be another Crestwood incident. No one heard her voice. Bill 4021 was made to break again. It was now only a felony if someone tampered with the water supply. Madigan stated; \\"We need to make sure that what happened to Crestwood residents never happens again in Illinois,\\" said Madigan. \\"The law needed to be strengthened to protect public safety and to restore public trust.\\" > Gov. Pat Quinn signed a bill Sunday that he says will help ensure Illinois > citizens have safe, clean drinking water. The bill is designed to prevent > future incidents like the water contamination discovered earlier this year > in south suburban Crestwood, Ill. For years, Crestwood village officials > told townspeople that all their water came from Lake Michigan exclusively, > when records showed that Crestwood was co-mingling its lake water with water > from a village well that had shown levels of a known carcinogen. The > governor has signed a law that will require water suppliers to notify all > their customers if tests reveal any contamination with their water supply. > In Crestwood's case, the EPA had long ago told the village that the well in > question had problems, but Crestwood didn't tell residents. Under the new > law, water suppliers have five days to notify all of their customers of any > problems. Commenting on the law just signed by Governor Quinn, Attorney General Lisa Madigan said They certainly weren't telling people who were drinking that water, brushing their teeth with that water, cooking with that water, showering with that water, that the water had contaminants in it. That is simply wrong, and it needs to end. =Changes to ILEPA= According to Miencke \\"The state EPA, because of the Crestwood issue, is changing one aspect of its water testing. There are more than 1,000 communities in Illinois that deliver water that they first purchase from someone else, another community or supplier. The EPA has always done its water quality testing at the supplier. Now, it will test at the distribution point.\\" In the July/August 2009 issue of \\"Illinois Issues,\\" author Bethany Jaeger reports that \\"because village officials reported that the well served only as an emergency backup, it wasn't required to be tested. And the state relies on an honor system for such reporting.\\"There was no federal requirement. They (village officials)knew what they were doing,\\" says Rick Cobb, deputy manager of the state EPA's Division of Public Water Supply. The department (IL EPA)detected vinyl chloride in Crestwood's well in September 2007. Less than two months later, Crestwood maintained that it still did not draw water from the well. The story changed on August 21, 2008, when Frank Scaccia, the former water supply operator, told officials that the village did, indeed, supplement Lake Michigan water with well water. =Water director retains an attorney= Frank Scaccia's attorney, Bill Seith of Total Environmental Solutions in Oakbrook Terrace, says his client \\"is certainly very interested in making sure that everybody is properly informed.\\" According to information posted on the firms website, Bill Seith, Scaccia's attorney, was previously the Deputy Director of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. Seith, in his own words said he has \\"more than 10 years (experience working)at Illinois Attorney General's office, Environmental Bureau, where he worked for more than four years as chief. \\"As a former Deputy Director of Illinois EPA, William Seith, oversaw that Agency's Office of Community Relations.\\" =Blagojevich-Madigan feud= The Chicago Tribune's Michael Hawthorne reported in an August 23, 2009 article \\"What appeared to be an obvious violation of state environmental laws became entangled in one of former Gov. Rod Blagojevich's political feuds, delaying action for months. Dozens of other cases against polluters languished as well, largely because Blagojevich and his top aides refused to refer them to his archnemesis, Atty. Gen. Lisa Madigan, a Tribune investigation found. Blagojevich and Madigan started out on amicable terms after they were elected in 2002. But EPA referrals of civil and criminal violations to the attorney general began to drop sharply in 2005, and fell to a record low of 114 in 2007, according to state records.\\" Hawthorne identified the feud between the Illinois Governor and the Attorney General as one of the contributing factors in the success of Crestwood's coverup. \\"The agency (the IL EPA) hasn't sent a criminal case to the attorney general in two years, records show.\\" The Tribune reporter noticed a concerning lack of prosecutions against environmental offenders. \\"By contrast, previous administrations on average referred about 300 environmental cases during most years since the mid-1980s. The EPA forwarded nearly 30 criminal violations to the attorney general in 2003, before the relationship soured between two of the state's top Democrats.\\" \\"Polluters didn't suddenly wise up and start following the law.\\" wrote Hawthorne, \\"Instead, top EPA officials now acknowledge, the agency avoided sending cases to Madigan, whose office handles most of the legal work for state government.\\" \\"There were some issues between us and the attorney general, and that skewed those numbers,\\" said the Illinois EPA Director Doug Scott, who was appointed by Blagojevich in 2005 and kept on by Quinn. According to the Rockford Register Star, Scott's hometown newspaper \\"Blagojevich and Doug Scott are good friends.\\" \\"As the conflict roiled, federal officials stepped in on some of the biggest environmental cases in the Chicago area.\\" The Tribune reporter pointed out \\"For instance, the U.S. EPA is conducting a high-profile criminal investigation into Crestwood's secret use of a community well contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals, a case the Illinois EPA tried to quietly handle informally while Blagojevich was still governor.\\" September 2009Installation of monitor= State inspectors dug a monitoring well on September 14 in Crestwood to help determine how the suburb's drinking water was contaminated with toxic chemicals. Testing equipment placed underground near Crestwood's former community well, which was dismantled earlier this year, will help determine whether cancer-causing solvents seeped through cracks in bedrock into the village's water supply. October 2009: new Illinois EPA test results On October 9, 2009 the Illinois EPA on its website released test results for the groundwater near the well that Crestwood used to obtain drinking water for its residents \\"The concentration of vinyl chloride found in the bedrock's groundwater between 39 and 49 feet below ground surface averaged 55.7 parts per billion (ppb), ten times the concentration Illinois EPA found in the PWS well 3 years ago (5.4 ppb). This water contains twenty five times more of the toxic compound vinyl chloride than is allowed in drinking water by law. December 2009 IDPH refuses to release cancer study Tricia Krause provided Michael Hawthorne with many boxes of factual documentation. The environmental reporter for the Chicago Tribune newspaper who broke the story about Crestwood's secret and illegal use of the contaminated well in 2008 wrote in an article from December 29, 2008 that \\"Six months after state health officials declared their investigation of cancer rates in south suburban Crestwood was almost complete, they have yet to release the results.\\" Even though Hawthorne and the Chicago Tribune had filed at least two FOIA requests for the details and data from the Illinois Department of Health study he was denied the information by the agency who stated \\"patient confidentiality\\" in their refusal to divulge the contents of the study. The Illinois Supreme Court has ruled in a similar case that the release of such study information does not violate patient confidentiality in any way because the patients cannot be identified by the information personally. As of December 29, 2009 the Illinois Department of Health has refused to release the study. The Tribune did not report information that the engineering company for the village of Crestwood was also involved in the debacle. January 2010: Chester Stranczek's attorneys say he is not fit to testify An article in the SouthTown Star newspaper on January 3, 2010 by Maura Possley reported that the attorneys for Chester Stranczek had filed a motion in front of Cook County Circuit Court Judge Mary K. Rochford to argue that the former mayor, who is now eighty years old, is not fit to testify in any of the many civil trials before the court at this time because he suffers from Parkinsons dementia. According to the article it is expected that the courts decision in this matter will set a precedent for all of the civil lawsuits and the anticipated criminal charges against Stranczek. During the hearing on January 13, 2010, Chester Stranczeks attorney, Chris Gair from the Chicago firm Jenner & Block, presented as a witness Dr. Cindy Zadikoff, an assistant professor of neurology specializing in movement disorders at NorthWestern Memorial Hospital. According to Maura Possley of the SouthTown Star Newspaper \\"Dr. Zadikoff examined Stranczek in August and October. The doctor testified that his wife reported that Stranczek, when they returned from their Boca Raton home to their Crestwood house, would forget where the bathroom or bedroom were.\\" The same article goes on to say that \\"Plaintiffs attorney Burton Weinstein ( a partner at the Chicago law firm of Baskin, Server, Berke & Weinstein ) questioned whether Stranczek could exaggerate symptoms or fake his way through her exams to try to indicate he was unfit to testify. Weinstein also referred to reports from Stranczek's former doctor of him having less-severe memory loss and said some of Stranczek's medications were known to heighten confusion or memory loss.\\" The Illinois competency statute merely states: \\"A defendant is unfit if, because of his mental or physical condition, he is unable to understand the nature and purpose of the proceedings against him or to assist in his defense.\\" In Dusky v. U.S., the Court held that a defendant's competency was measured by \\"whether he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding‚Äîand whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him\\" Maura Possley of the SouthTown Star Newspaper reported that \\"testimony from doctors, originally expected to be finished last Friday, was scheduled to continue Feb. 9 and 10 at the Daley Center in Chicago.\\" Possley followed the hearings at the Daley Center closely and in an article in the SouthTown Star newspaper on March 31, 2010 detailing the closing arguments in the case she wrote \\"attorneys for current and former Crestwood residents argued doctors' examinations of Stranczek as late as last year indicated his competency is well within the bounds of answering to their pending complaints.\\" In the same article Possley quoted attorney Larry Drury who represents Crestwood resident Joseph Marzano in a lawsuit against the village and the former mayor \\"He's (Chester Stranczek) very well aware of his surroundings and what's going on in his life.\\" Drury went on to say in his closing argument \\"I would call it litigation dementia that's been set up by him (Chester Stranczek)\\" Drury also claimed \\"Our position is they (Stranczek's lawyers) never sustained their burden of proof\\" in regards to the claims of Chester Stranczek's attorneys in the case. In an April 14 article written in the Chicago Tribune, Michael Hawthorne said \\"Former Crestwood Mayor Chester Stranczek is fit enough to be interviewed in lawsuits accusing village officials of pumping contaminated drinking water to residents for more than two decades, a judge ruled Wednesday.\\" According to Maura Possley in a SouthTown Star newspaper report from April 14, 2010, Crestwood's former mayor Chester Stranczek will have to testify in the civil cases against him. Possley reported \\"Cook County Circuit Court Judge Mary K. Rochford ruled Wednesday that the plaintiffs' attorneys can submit handwritten questions through a neutral third party to the 80-year-old Stranczek.\\" The Chicago Tribune said that in a lengthy 51-page decision, Cook County Circuit Judge Mary Rochford ruled \\"there is no evidence that a deposition would be physically harmful in any way to Stranczek.\\" Hawthorne also wrote that \\"Lawyers will be allowed to submit written questions that Stranczek will answer in a two-hour videotaped interview, but the session will not count as evidence. The judge (Cook County Circuit Judge Mary Rochford) later will determine if he is competent to testify at trial.\\" The article quoted Judge Rochford as ruling that \\"there is no evidence that a deposition would be physically harmful in any way to Stranczek.\\" Crestwood's legal costs A Sunday, January 24, 2010 investigative article in the SouthTown Star Newspaper by staff writers Maura Possley and Lauren Fitzpatrick explained how the residents of Crestwood are paying the costs for the legal defense of those who stand accused of making the decision to use the contaminated Municipal Well #1 to provide drinking water to the community. Seven months after the contaminated water story was made public the village has paid almost nine hundred thousand dollars in legal fees to seven different law firms. \\"With the legal proceedings in the debacle barely beginning, the final price tag for Crestwood's defense could not only balloon into the millions, but also fall to the residents,\\" the article said. The majority of the costs were paid to the law firm Jenner and Block who was paid more than $300,000 in fees to represent Crestwood's former mayor Chester Stranczek in the civil proceedings in which he is named as a defendant. These costs are for the months of June through September 2009, a four-month period in which the cost of Chester Stranczek's legal fees averaged $75,000 per month. Robert Stranczek, the current mayor of Crestwood has cost the village $205,604 in legal fees paid to the firm of Tabet, Divito and Rothstein for the four months between August and November 2009. Mayor Stranczek's legal fees averaged $50,000 a month in the four months of 2009 that records were available for. Other firms retained by the Village of Crestwood for legal work related to its use of the contaminated municipal well include Stetler and Duffy Ltd who was paid $161,987 from June through November 2009, Cotsirilos, Tighe and Streicher, paid $55,542 from July through November 2009, Pretzel and Stouffer, retained to represent Crestwood in insurance cases where the village's insurance companies are denying coverage in the water issue, were paid $59,507 from September through November 2009, the firm of Schain, Burney, Ross and Sitron was paid $50,820 from June through August 2009, Sosin and Arnold, the village's municipal law firm, was paid $33,128 from June through November 2009 for their work on the combined water cases and the Gensen and Gillespie firm received $9,100 in legal fees last August. \\"Some of Chicago's most high-powered law firms...have been tapped by the village for its defense of Mayor Robert Stranczek and his father and former Mayor Chester Stranczek.\\" reported the SouthTown Star Newspaper. The reporters had to make repeated Freedom of Information Act requests in order to obtain this information. Possley and Fitzpatrick wrote that the village \\"threw up several roadblocks\\" related to their FOIA requests for information ablout the legal fees that Crestwood was paying to defend its village officials in the civil lawsuits that have been filed against them. \\"What the seven firms have so far done for the village is unclear\\" according to the January 24th investigative article \\"the village's municipal attorneys blacked out descriptions of services rendered on the documents and any information about hourly rates, citing attorney-client privilege\\" the SouthTown Star reporters wrote, and they also mentioned that \\"the Illinois attorney general's office is reviewing that decision.\\" Mayor Robert Stranczek told the Southtown Star in an interview on Thursday January 21 that the village is paying legal fees with cash reserves in the village's coffers. \\"The village last year moved to conserve cash to pay some of the mounting legal bills by reneging on an annual ritual of rebating a portion of residents' property taxes\\" wrote Possley and Fitzpatrick, who also said that Mayor Robert Stranczek suspended the tax rebates made famous by his father, Chester Stranczek in order to pay for their legal defense. Possley and Fitzpatrick's article did not address whether the village would have to pay for the legal defense of the officials if they are indicted and charged as criminals in the water case. March 2010 IDPH Finds Elevated Cancer Rate in Crestwood = In a study released on March 5, 2010 the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) found \\"significantly elevated\\" levels of cancer among Crestwood residents. The purpose of this study was not to determine whether or not the contaminated drinking water was or was not to blame for the illness' of the residents, according to the report itself it was designed to be only an \\"assessment of cancer incidence for Crestwood.\\" The IDPH investigators sought only to see if there were more cases of cancer in Crestwood than they would expect statistically. Later in the day on March 5, 2010 the IDPH issued another press release which said \\"IDPH's assessment found that the types of cancer one might expect to be elevated due to exposure to the chemicals found in the Crestwood drinking water, were not found to be elevated.\\" Because of a lack of testing however the IDPH has admitted previously that the contaminant chemicals and their levels in the well may never be known. \\"The consumption of contaminated water has elevated the Kidney, Lung and Gastrointestinal cancer rates in residents of the village\\" according to an article on Topnews.com. \\"The authors of the health assessment base their data on where a person was living at the time of diagnosis.\\" The study, conducted by the Illinois State Cancer Registry, a division of the state Department of Public Health, analyzed 952 cancer cases from 1994 to 2006. The IDPH report did not implicate the contaminated municipal well or exposure to the village's contaminated water as a reason for the elevated incidence of cancer in Crestwood, it also did not rule out exposure to the carcinogenically contaminated public drinking water supply as a factor for the higher cancer rates of Crestwood residents. Kidney cancer in males in Crestwood was almost double the level researchers had expected to find. Lung cancer in males and females in Crestwood was thirty five percent higher than what the researchers expected to find. Oral cavity and pharynx cancers in Crestwood men are seventy three percent higher than what researchers expected to find. Esophagus cancer in Crestwood males was twice as high as the state researchers expected it to be. \\"The study verifies what Crestwood residents have been saying for decades, according to Chicago attorney Mike Mertz, who represents 20 individuals who claim Crestwood's water supply triggered their illnesses\\" \\"This report confirms the anecdotal evidence that residents have been saying for years, that there's a link between the incidents of cancer and the fact that Crestwood was putting a known carcinogen into its water,\\" Mertz commented in the SouthTown Star article. He went on to point out to SouthTown Star reporter Amy Lee that \\"It confirms much of what we expected, but probably underreports the striking cancer cluster that exists in Crestwood.\\" Michael Hawthorne wrote an article on March 3, 2010 in the Chicago Tribune and noted \\"The report's conclusions are a sharp contrast to statements made by some state officials after the disclosure of the tainted well. Last April, Doug Scott, director of the Illinois EPA, said \\"the public's health never was at risk\\" because the well water was diluted with treated Lake Michigan water. That statement has been frequently repeated by Crestwood officials.\\" In the March 5th SouthTown Star article, reporter Amy Lee interviewed water quality expert David De John who said \\"It's flat-out disturbing because, as they note in the report, they have not seen all these cases come to reality, we have not seen the end of these illnesses.\\" The IDPH report only considers cancer cases diagnosed up to the year 2006 and only those where the initial diagnosis was made while the patient resided in Crestwood. IDPH officials have given no reason why the study did not take cases into consideration from the last four years. The Health Department's report did state that \\"the extension of exposure until 2007 could suggest that some cancers associated with the exposure might have not yet occurred.\\" A \\"Fact Sheet\\" issued by the IDPH accompanying the study released on March 5, 2010 said \\"cancer does not develop immediately after contact with a cancer-causing agent (carcinogen). The time between the exposure to a carcinogen and medical diagnosis of cancer, called latency period, is often 10 to 20 years.\\" =Residents respond to IDPH study= Frank Caldario, diagnosed with kidney cancer at thirty years old, commented to the Chicago Tribune \\"I can't help but wonder if what happened to me had something to do with the water,\\" said Caldario, who doesn't smoke and has lived in Crestwood since 1993. \\"Of course there's a concern. If I said it wasn't in the back of my head, I'd be lying. You don't want to think something bad could happen from just drinking water\\", said Dominic Covone, 37, a resident of about six years. \\"This is what we've been asking for,\\" said Steven Nelson, a Crestwood resident who helped organize a Facebook group to spread information about the contaminated well. \\"What's been missing is the hard data about any illnesses in the community.\\" \\"We are dealing with a situation where we have known exposure,\\" said Ken Runkle, a state health department toxicologist. \\"That means we can view these elevated cancer levels in a different light.\\" \\"Melaney Arnold with the Illinois Department of Public Health says there are too many variables to definitively link cancer with the tainted water\\" according to a report by Chicago Public Radio which also interviewed an 'unidentified' village official who said \\"the report strengthens Crestwood's case that the contaminated well is not to blame for the illnesses.\\" The results of the state study are \\"flat-out disturbing,\\" according to David De John, a water quality expert who owns Enviro Science Products in Oak Forest and wrote \\"What's in My Water?,\\" a book that compiled various water quality reports from a range of public and private agencies. While he doesn't believe the water ingested by Crestwood residents was the sole cause of these instances of cancer, De John believes it was likely a factor, he said in an interview with a reporter from the SouthTown Star Newspaper. \\"Most shocking,\\" De John said in the same interview, \\"was the data showing much higher rates of cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx esophagus in Crestwood than researchers had anticipated.\\" Researchers found twice as many cases of esophageal cancer as they expected and nearly twice as many cases of oral cavity cancer. Some residents of Crestwood claimed that the federal government was using \\"Gestapo\\" tactics in the investigation against the current and former mayors Robert and Chester Stranczek. =Crestwood's Water Director is fired= On March 13, 2010 Maura Possley of the SouthTown Star reported that Frank Scaccia, Crestwood's water director was fired. \\"Mayor Robert Stranczek confirmed Friday that public works director Frank Scaccia was terminated, but the mayor refused to elaborate about why he was dismissed\\" Possley reported.After the Crestwood case; Maura Possley eventually became Madigans spokesperson. =IDPH open meeting on health assessment= The Illinois Department of Public Health announced that they will be hosting an open meeting on health assessment on March 13, 2010. The meeting will be held at the Trinity Christian College's Ozinga Chapel Auditorium at 6601 W. College Drive in Palos Heights Illinois at 2pm. \\"Crestwood residents who unknowingly drank contaminated water for years unleashed a wave of criticism Saturday toward public health officials who were there to explain a new study that showed cancer rates are 'significantly elevated' in the south suburb\\" wrote Jared Hopkins in the Chicago Tribune The meeting was attended by \\"more than 100 people.\\" Bill Gannon, a resident of Crestwood since 1972 told the panel on stage \\"What kind of whitewash is this...these aren't facts...these are just part-time facts put in where you feel like putting them in.\\" Howard Smith, a Manteno resident who worked at ComEd in Crestwood for almost 30 years, asked health officials about possibly including people in the cancer study who didn't live in the village but worked there for decades.

He was a student of the famous contemporary artist Ren√© Francisco Rodriguez at Havana‚Äôs Cuban Institute of Art. He also participated in two Havana Biennial exhibitions (in 2000 and 2006). Biography Passionate with drawings, Duvier del Dago Fernandez entered the art school of Trinidad, before graduating from the prestigious Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA) in Havana. The first project he participated in was the DUPP Gallery, with his professor Ren√© Francisco Rodr√≠guez. From 1999 to 2002, Duvier del Dago Fernandez started to work with another artist, Omar Moreno. They worked together under the name of Omarito & Duvier, exhibiting in Cuba and abroad. Duvier del Dago Fernandez started to make three-dimensional models of some of his drawings in order to make them look as real as possible. It was the genesis of his current creations. Installations Duvier del Dago Fernandez‚Äô installations usually start with small drawings on semi-transparent nylon. Then, without the use of any computer or 3-D program, he translates them into spatial objects. He creates a spatial 'connect the dots' system, using cotton thread and a series of hooks on wooden panels. This creates a visual effect that makes his creations look like holograms. One of his first holograms was the Reproducer (2001). Then, he created a lot of similar installations: Castles in the Air (2004), Bungalow (his project for the 2006 Havana Biennial), The Strange Case of the Ideal Onlooker (2006) and Plastic Girl (2007) exhibited in Madrid. In 2008, he organised a personal exhibition called ‚ÄúEl salto‚Äù at the Nina Menocal Gallery situated in Mexico.

Strafing allows a player to keep the camera focused on a target such as an enemy, while moving in a different direction. Techniques=Circle strafing The blue player circle strafes counterclockwise around his red adversary, while firing continually. Red, unable to keep track of the moving blue player (and failing to lead the target), misses his shots. Circle strafing is the technique of moving around an opponent in a circle while facing them. Circle strafing allows a player to fire continuously at an opponent while evading their attacks. Circle strafing is most useful in close-quarters combat where the apparent motion of the circle strafing player is much greater than that of their stationary enemy, and thus the chance of making the enemy lose track of their target is higher and/or the enemy is required to lead the target when firing. The effectiveness of circle strafing is mitigated when the opponent's weapon fires projectiles that travel instantaneously (also referred to as a hitscan weapon), or fires at a high rate, e.g. with a machine gun. Circle strafing is especially effective when lag negatively affects the players' ability to hit their target. When latency is high and the game doesn't have client-side hit detection, this can lead to two players circling each other, both missing all their attacks. Many shooters will allow players to aim down the sights of a gun or use a scope, usually exchanging movement speed and field of vision for greater accuracy. This can make a player more vulnerable to circle strafing, as targets will pass through their field of vision more quickly, they are less capable of keeping up with a target, and their slow movement makes dodging more difficult. =Strafing in melee combat= Circle strafing has also spread to some 3D action and adventure video games that involve melee combat. Circle strafing in melee combat can be made easier with a lock-on system that snaps the camera's (and the player character's) focus on one particular target, guaranteeing that most of the player character's attacks will land a direct hit on the target. It enables the player character to concentrate on moving around the enemy to dodge their attacks while staying automatically focused on the enemy. This can be a crucial strategy against bosses and powerful enemies, and is notably employed in many The Legend of Zelda titles, starting with Ocarina of Time. Straferunning A diagrammatical explanation of straferunning. Particularly in older first-person shooters (FPSs), straferunning (known as speed-strafing among players of GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark, and as trichording among players of the Descent series) is a technique that allows a player to run or fly faster through levels by moving forwards and sideways at the same time. The game combines these actions and the player achieves roughly 1.4 (square root of 2) times the speed they would moving in a single direction. The method used by the game can be demonstrated using vector addition. Pathways into Darkness was one of the first games to allow straferunning. The games in which straferunning can be employed treat forward motion independently of sideways (strafing) motion. If, for each update of the player's location, the game moves the player forward one unit and then moves the player to the side by one unit, the overall distance moved is \\\\sqrt{2}. Thus, in games with such behavior, moving sideways while simultaneously moving forward will give an overall higher speed than just moving forward, although the player will move in a direction diagonal to the direction being faced. This feature is even more enhanced if moving along three axes (e.g. forward + left + up), providing \\\\sqrt{3} (roughly 1.73) times greater speed, in games such as Descent. This technique is not possible in all games; most and especially modern games would clamp the player's speed and acceleration to a uniform maximum when moving in any direction.  Strafe- jumping  Strafe-jumping is a technique used to increase a player's movement speed in computer games based on the Quake engine and its successors, most of which are first-person shooters. = History = Strafe-jumping was a result of a bug in the code base of the 1996 first-person shooter video game Quake. In Quake's sequels it was decided to be kept intact, as it had become a standard technique used by players. The exploit relies on an oversight in acceleration and maximum speed calculation: when pressing a movement key, the game adds an acceleration vector in that direction to the player's current velocity. When the player has reached a maximum speed value, further acceleration is prevented. However, the movement speed limit is only applied in relation to the acceleration vector's direction and not the direction of the overall velocity, meaning that precisely manipulating the angle between overall velocity and this acceleration vector lets the player break the intended speed cap. = Method = Strafe-jumping requires a precise combination of mouse and keyboard inputs. The exact technique involved depends on the game in question. In several games, there are entire maps devoted to this, much like obstacle courses. The controls are typically as follows: # The player holds the move forward key, accelerating to the maximum walking speed. # The player jumps and simultaneously starts holding either the strafe left or the strafe right key, in addition to the move forward key. # While airborne, the player moves the mouse slowly in the direction he/she is strafing. This turns the character and directs the acceleration to an angle that lets the player break the speed cap. # To prevent speed loss from ground friction, the player immediately jumps again on landing. # Strafe-jumping this way will slowly curve the player's trajectory, so to compensate the player can switch the direction of strafing and mouse movement to the opposite side. Done correctly and continuously, this will gradually increase the player's speed. Mastering this technique requires much practice. Sustained strafe-jumping is mainly a matter of muscle memory, as both the required range and precision of mouse movements increase as the player builds up speed. In Quake III Arena and some games based on its engine, such as Call of Duty and Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, slight increases in jump height can be achieved by playing the game at specific frame rates. = Circle jump = The circle jump is an action performed by the player at the start of strafe-jumping, giving an initial burst of speed. It uses the same mechanics as strafe-jumping, but on the ground before the first jump, and requires faster mouse movement. The controls are as follows: # The player stands facing 90-135 degrees away from the direction he/she desires to eventually move in. # The player starts holding both the move forward key and the strafe key towards the desired direction, and also moves the mouse in the same direction. This turns and rapidly accelerates the player. # When the player is facing the desired movement direction, he/she jumps to preserve the gained speed. # The player can now start strafe-jumping and continue accelerating. = Bunny hopping = Bunny hopping is a broadly used term for different kinds of movement in games. A player who simply jumps up and down to be more difficult to target is sometimes called a bunny hopper. Jumping on sloped surfaces to gain speed is called bunny hopping in games such as The Elder Scrolls Online. Some games feature more technical exploits known as bunny hopping which allow the player to move faster or more nimbly than normal. In games utilising the Quake or GoldSrc game engines or their derivatives, bunny hopping is a technique related to strafe-jumping that lets a player accelerate beyond the speed cap and change direction quickly mid-air. The kind of advanced bunny hopping that utilizes strafing controls exists in Quake, the Quake III Arena mod Challenge ProMode Arena, and their derivatives such as Warsow and Xonotic; Half-Life (version 1.1.0.8, released in 2001, introduced a speed cap limiting the effectiveness of bunny hopping) and many of its mods and sibling games such as Team Fortress Classic, Team Fortress 2, Dystopia, and the Counter-Strike series; Painkiller, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, Kingpin: Life of Crime, and Apex Legends.

It is currently known to be restricted to the Krem Synrang Pamiang cave system near the Jaintia Hills, where it is threatened by limestone extraction. This species lives in pools of standing water within the cave system preferring these to the streams of flowing water, being most numerous in the largest and deepest pools. This may be because the larger pools offer a more stable environment for the fish. Downloaded on 21 January 2018.

It was built in 1676 as a residence for Bailie William Logan and his wife Jean MoirSee Volume 2 of Munro, Alexander Macdonald, ed., Records of Old Aberdeen, 1157‚Äì1891 (Aberdeen: New Spalding Club, 1899‚Äì1909). of Stoneywood. During the late 18th century, Old Aberdeen Bedesmen moved from their original hospital beside St Machar‚Äôs Church to the former Logan house in Don Street. In the 19th century the house changed hands. It was first owned by the Burgh of Old Aberdeen, then, by the City of Aberdeen after the merger of the two burghs in 1891. The house was refurbished by the City of Aberdeen Council in 1965. It was divided into two flats or apartments. The flats are now in private ownership. Much of the 17th-century building is in its original form. It is an excellent example of an L-shaped Scottish Town House, built on three floors with an attic. The house is designated as a Category A listed building.  History  Bede House, Old Aberdeen, 1676 The story of a Bede House in Old Aberdeen starts in 1531 when Bishop Gavin Dunbar of St Machar Cathedral, under the instruction of James V of Scotland, had built a hospital for the elderly poor in Old Aberdeen. The church of St Machar, founded in the 5th century, was a centre of community life in the area of Aberdeen immediately to the south of the river Don in what is now Seaton Park. The Bishop, whose predecessor William Elphinstone had helped found the University of Aberdeen, was a reforming cleric who took seriously his responsibilities to his flock. Such hospitals were not uncommon in medieval times with many in Scotland and England. There was another hospital, St Peters, just outside the 16th-century settlement in Aberdeen. These houses acted as refuges for elderly men. In 1676, a Bailie of Old Aberdeen, William Logan, married Jean Moir of Stoneywood and as a senior member of the burgh they had built a town house on a plot of land on the East side of Don Street. The plot was based on an existing croft of 40 roods on the east side of Don Street leading from Old Aberdeen to the Brig O‚Äô Balgownie. Don Street was the main artery north out of Aberdeen heading north past the St Peter‚Äôs hospital and Old Kirkyard along what is now called the Spital and past the Kings College of what is now the University of Aberdeen. Bailie Logan and his wife lived in their house until he died in 1680. Jean Moir continued to live there until her death in 1700. They are both buried in St Machar's Cathedral. By 1786, the old Bede House, adjacent to St Machar‚Äôs Church, was in disrepair and the owner of the land, James Forbes- Seaton, negotiated a move of the Bedesmen to the house in Don Street. This house, has been known since as The Bede House, Old Aberdeen. Recent developments around the property also use the name ‚Äì e.g. Bede Court. Bedesmen lived in Don Street for a short period. However, by the early 20th century the building needed repairs. After the union of Old Aberdeen and Aberdeen burghs in 1891, the City Council of Aberdeen used the Bede House as rented accommodation. In 1965, a complete refurbishment of the building was undertaken and two modern style flats or apartments created. The City retained its ownership until the tenants exercised their right to buy under local government legislation in the nineteen eighties. The properties remain in private ownership.  Building  The Bede House is described in a few written accounts. It is recalled by Roger (1902) as \\"a good specimen of a seventeenth century Scottish Town House\\". The original house consisted of three stories and an attic. Entry to the house from Don Street is through a ‚Äúpend‚Äù or alleyway leading to two doors. To the left is access to what is now cellars, the second door opens into a spiral stone staircase leading to the upper floors. The pend has a gate dating from 1965. The tower at the rear, which is capped with a pyramidal roof, carries the stairs to the second floor. From the second floor to the attic there is a set of stairs with a corbelled turret. These stairs are now closed off but can be accessed through a bedroom from one of the flats. The first floor would have been a \\"great hall\\" in Logan's time. A plaque commemorating William Logan and Janet Moir is attached to the square tower above and to the right of the door. It reads In English, \\"William Logan and his wife had the house built to their orders in the year 1676\\". Early prints show the house (probably in the 18th century) as having a building attached at right angles to the main building accessible from the courtyard to the rear. No records exist to confirm that there was a substantial building attached. The remains of the wooden roof beam are still visible. It is likely that some of the closed off arches along the internal stairway from the ground floor to the first floor, led into this building. To the right of the square tower was a chimney, again no longer present. However, bricks can be seen high in the wall of the tower indicating the chimney's location. The remnants of a beam forming the roof of the outbuilding are also visible, high in the wall of the house to the right of the square tower. Adjacent to the Bede House on Don Street nearer the University is a low two story building. There is evidence that this house was built from stones from the central tower at St Machar‚Äôs Cathedral that fell in a storm in 1688.  Scottish Bedesmen  The earliest account of Bedesmen across Scotland comes from the reign of James VI, in 1607. While there had been Bedesmen in Old Aberdeen since 1531, the practice of a community supporting the \\"puir\\" does not appear to be widespread. In an 1885 book, the following record from 1607 highlights the dress of the Bedesmen and their prayerful approach to life. June 2 The Privy Council refer to ‚Äúa very ancient and loveable custom‚Äù of giving a blue gown, purse and as many Scottish shillings as agreed with the years of the King‚Äôs age, to men ‚Äúauld puir men‚Äù as likewise agreed with the king‚Äôs years and seeing it to be ‚Äúvery necessary and expedient that the said custom should continuit‚Äù they gave orders accordingly. The ‚Äúauld puir men‚Äù so favoured were called the King‚Äôs Bedesmen, notwithstanding any general enactments that might exist against mendicancy. Their blue cloak bore a pewter badge which assured them this right. They were expected to requite the king‚Äôs bounty by their prayers; and, doubtless as they had such an interest in the increase of his years, their intercessions for his prolonged life must have been sincere. The distribution of the cloaks and purses used to take place on the king‚Äôs birthday, at the end of the Toolbooth of Edinburgh, till a time not long gone by.'' Chambers, R (1885) Domestic Annals of Scotland from the Reformation to the Rebellion of 1745, Edinburgh. Although there are many fine examples of \\"beggars\\" badges, there is no evidence that all Bedesmen had a badge. Examples of beggars' badges in the National Museum in Edinburgh, include an 1857 \\"King's Bedesman or Blue Gown Badge\\". Recent evidence suggests that Old Aberdeen Bedesmen may be have been called \\"Blue Coats\\". In the minutes of the Kirk Session of St Machar's Cathedral Church, for 11 February 1644, a Johone Gordone was given 6 shillings. He is referred to as \\".. ane kings beidsmen..\\". On the 8th December of that year, 1644, he is awarded 12 shillings. In this entry in the Kirk Session records he is referred to as \\"... ane poor man ane blue gowne..\\". This is compelling evidence to suggest that the Dunbar Hospital Bedesmen were referred to as Blue Gowns. The implication, is that they may have worn a blue cloak and may have had a badge to identify their position.Records of Old Aberdeen, Volume 2, The Spalding Club See beggar's badge.  Aberdeen Bedesmen  The Bedesmen were almsmen who received support from the local community. In Old Aberdeen, the main pillars of the community were the church, the Church of St Machar also now known as St Machar‚Äôs Cathedral, and the Town Council. Latterly, the Principal of the University and the Minister of St Machar‚Äôs Cathedral have until recently acted as a committee to ensure the Bedesmen were looked after. In an article in the local press in 1968, Cuthbert Graham claims the Bedesmen only lived in the house for a few decades. The article contains an account describing the existence of the Bedesmen that is very similar to an account of the Bede House of Higham Ferrers. The foundation charter of Bishop Dunbar's Hospital, dated 24 February 1531 relates that Bishop Dunbar claimed \\".. when something is left after supplying the needs of the church and our own life, and remembering the words of Almighty God, ... give of they bread to the hungry and the poor and the wandering under the shelter of the house and clothe the naked we resolve to make a hospital...\\" The drawing by Andrew Gibb gives a clear impression of the structure. In Aberdeen the men lived in separate rooms each 14 ft. long and 12 ft. broad in a building some 100 ft. long and 32 ft. wide. On the north side of the house was a common room and on the south side an oratory. There was a wooden bell tower and a bell. The men were to be maintained out of the revenue of the burgh of Old Aberdeen the sum of ¬£100 (Scots) ‚Äì roughly equal to ¬£8 in modern currency. In the 16th century the men rose at 7 a.m. on the call of the Janitor ‚Äì one of the Bedesmen ‚Äì and they went to pray in St Machar‚Äôs Cathedral. They dined at 11 a.m. The day proceeded with prayers; work in the gardens and a supper at 6 p.m. So the day continued with prayers and \\"..good conversation‚Ä¶\\" until 3 a.m. the next day with a strict instruction from Dunbar that \\".. at all times they should be seemly in conversation and not in any manner whatever receive women into their apartments‚Ä¶\\". Praying was central to their existence. By the 1860s a sum of 8 shillings a month was given to the Bedesmen. The number of Bedesmen had increased from 12 to 16 by 1902. The eldest two were also given two salmon from the River Don. In the late nineteen sixties, there were only eight Bedesmen each receiving 15 shillings or ¬£0.75 from the Church Officer of St Machar on the last Thursday of each month. (See Graham, Cuthbert & Ian Hardie - photographs (1968) Press and Journal, 10 February 1968 \\"Blossoming of the Bede House\\".) Latterly the monies received by the Church were insufficient to support a payment to the Bedesmen and residual funds were amalgamated with other Poor Relief funds. The most recent and probably only picture of the Bedesmen shows eleven gentlemen in formal suits greeting Queen Mary on a visit to St Machar's Cathedral Aberdeen on 12 September 1922.Queen Mary was in Aberdeen to open the new Rowett Research Institute. She lunched with the University Principal in The Channory Lodge and then, after visiting St Machar's Cathedral, inspected the Bedesmen. Katherine Trail Katherine E Trail (1932) Reminiscences of Old Aberdeen, Wylie, Aberdeen. calls them Royal Bedesmen. The last Bedesman died in 1988. See also...Beadsman  Bedesmen, beggars and pilgrims  There are doubts about the relationship between Bedesmen, beggars and Pilgrims. There are many fine examples of beggars' badges and there is evidence that Royal Bedesmen had an identifying badge. This badge would carry the motto \\"Pass and Re-Pass\\" - to indicate that they were permitted to move from community to community. Travellers and Pilgrims often had a badge to identify them as bone fide.The shell badge is an example. It is open to question if bedesmen in general had any identifying garment or badge.  Secret passages  Andrew Cluer Cluer, Andrew & Stanley Robertson (1980) Walkin the Mat ‚Äì Past Impression of Aberdeen, Lantern Books, recounts the story of a recent \\"secret\\" passage. It is claimed that this blocked-off passage leads from the Bede House to the Cathedral. This is a distance of some 500 metres. The book goes on to relate \\".. the Beadle (of St. Machar's) used to buy the minister booze, at the grocer's shop by the Town House and smuggle a \\"carry out\\" into St. Machar's ..\\" Cluer also reports that \\"evidence\\" of this was the bottles found in the secret passage when it could be walked \\"... in living memory\\". There is a similar interesting story about a \\"secret passage\\" from the adjacent Spital (Number 45) to St. Peter's Cemetery. The Spital (See Morgan, Diane The Villages of Aberdeen; The Spital, Denburn Books, .) form part of the road from Don Street, through the High Street into Aberdeen. Number 45 Spital was a leper hospital and a secret passage leading directly to the cemetery of St Peter's Church. The passage story is disputed by Diane Morgan. The similarity of the stories is coincidental ‚Äì but it does indicate the way many local inhabitants built links between buildings, people and unlikely circumstances. As evidence of this one of the recent residents in the Bede House also believed there was a passage from the Bede House to St Machar‚Äôs Cathedral. He claimed to have seen it when the houses were being renovated in 1965. There is no evidence to support this claim.

Pliny's ships were unable to approach the shore to rescue Rectina. It is not documented whether she survived. Pliny himself died after putting ashore further down the coast. Pliny the Younger says that Rectina was married to a man named Bassus or Tascius or Tascus; the name is rendered differently by different translators.

The Court found that police do not have the right to perform a sniffer-dog search (to use dogs to conduct random searches) of public spaces when such search is not specifically authorized by statute. In this case, a suspect's section 8 rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (\\"Charter\\") were violated when a police officer stopped him at a bus station and sniffer-dog searched his bag finding drugs in his possession.  Background  On January 25, 2002, at about 11:00 a.m. at the Calgary, Alberta, bus terminal, three police officers were involved in a special operation designed to detect drug couriers. While observing a bus arriving at the station, they spotted the accused, Gurmakh Kang-Brown, disembarking from the all-night Greyhound bus from Vancouver. The accused gave the officers an elongated stare. The officers found the accused's behaviour suspicious, stopped him and asked him if he was carrying narcotics. The accused said no. Then, one of the officers asked to look in the accused's bag. The accused put his bag down and unzipped it. When the accused was unzipping the bag, the officer went to touch the bag. The accused pulled it away, looking nervous. The officer signaled another officer to have a drug- sniffing dog sniff the man's bag. The dog indicated the presence of drugs in the bag. The officers arrested the accused for possession of and/or trafficking in drugs, searched him and found drugs on his person and in his bag.  Lower court rulings = Trial Court  At trial, the judge found that the accused was neither detained nor searched unlawfully and that the odours from the bag, which emanated freely in a public transportation facility, did not constitute information in which the accused had a reasonable expectation of privacy. Accordingly, section 8 of the Charter was not implicated.  Court of Appeal  On appeal, the Alberta Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that there had been no detention and that the question was whether the ordinary citizen who has committed no offence has a reasonable expectation of privacy which would be significantly invaded by the police action in question. To determine whether the accused had a reasonable expectation of privacy, the following factors were considered: * that the police were in a purely public place (not the yard of a home) * that the dog only yielded a crude piece of information (yes or no to the presence of an unknown quantity of an unknown illegal drug) * that no intimate details of private lives could possibly be revealed * that the odors came out passively * and that they were detected by something similar to (but more sensitive than) an ordinary human nose. The Court concluded that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy for that limited information in that public place and that there was no search. He agreed with the trial judge that even if there had been a Charter breach, the evidence ought not to be excluded under section 24(2) of the Charter.  Supreme Court ruling  The accused appealed to the Supreme Court. The Court found that the search and detention violated section 8 of the Charter and that the evidence should be excluded because it would interfere with the fairness of justice under section 24(2) of the Charter. Hence, the conviction was set aside. The following issues were put to the Court: # whether dog sniff constituted search # if so, whether the search was reasonable. # if the search was unreasonable and the appellant's rights were violated, whether the evidence ought to be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; # whether common law powers of police to investigate crime include use of sniffer dogs.  Opinion of the Court  All the nine judges agreed that the dog sniff of the passenger's bag at the bus station amounted to a search within section 8 of the Charter. McLachlin CJ and Binnie, LeBel, Fish, Abella and Charron JJ agreed that the sniffer dog search of the passenger‚Äôs bag at the bus station violated section 8 of the Charter and that in the circumstances of this case, the evidence should be excluded pursuant to section 24(2) of the Charter. According to LeBel, Fish, Abella and Charon JJ, the sniffer-dog search breached section 8 because such a search was not specifically authorized by statute. In determining whether the police were authorized at common law to conduct the search in fulfillment of their general duty to investigate crime, the threshold for the exercise of police powers should not be lowered to one of \\"reasonable suspicion\\", since to do so would impair the important safeguards found in section 8 against unjustified state intrusion. The existing and well established standard of \\"reasonable and probable grounds\\" should be applied. In this case, the search did not meet this standard. According to McLachlin CJ and Binnie J, a proper balance between an individual's section 8 rights and the reasonable demands of law enforcement would be struck by permitting such \\"sniff\\" searches on a \\"reasonable suspicion\\" standard without requiring prior judicial authorization.  Reasonable suspicion standard  \\"Suspicion\\" is an expectation that the targeted individual is possibly engaged in some criminal activity. A \\"reasonable\\" suspicion means something more than a mere suspicion and something less than a belief based upon reasonable and probable grounds. Because sniffer dog searches are conducted without prior judicial authorization, the after the fact judicial scrutiny of the grounds for the alleged \\"reasonable suspicion\\" must be rigorous. Here, the police action was based on speculation. The sniff in this case was an unreasonable search since the RCMP officer did not have grounds for reasonable suspicion at the time the dog was called. However, because of R. v. MacKenzie, [2013] 3 SCR 250, 2013 SCC 50 (CanLII), police can now simply draw on their experience in the field to create broad categories of ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù behaviour into which almost anyone could fall. Such an approach risks transforming the already flexible standard of reasonable suspicion into the ‚Äúgeneralized‚Äù suspicion standard.  Dissent  Bastarache, Deschamps and Rothstein JJ dissented. They found that the dog sniff of the passenger's bag at the bus station amounted to a search under section 8 of the Charter. However, there is no need to determine whether the evidence should be excluded pursuant to section 24(2) of the Charter because the sniffer dog search of the passenger‚Äôs bag at the bus station did not violate section 8 of the Charter.

Early life and education Born into a musical family in Nanjing, Jiangsu, Di Wu entered Beijing's Central Conservatory of Music at age 12. She made her professional debut at age 14 with the Beijing Philharmonic, and thereafter toured widely to positive reviews. In 1999, Wu came to the United States to continue her music studies, first with Zenon Fishbein at the Manhattan School of Music, then with Gary Graffman at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia from 2000 to 2005. Wu earned a Master of Music degree at The Juilliard School under Yoheved Kaplinsky, and in 2009, she received an Artist Diploma under the guidance of Joseph Kalichstein and Robert McDonald. Performances Wu has toured widely in Asia, Europe and the United States, where she has performed with prominent musicians such as Christoph Eschenbach and the Curtis Symphony Orchestra;Live Recording, Curtis Symphony Orchestra (Christoph Eschenbach, Di Wu, Thomas Bloch): MESSIAEN Turangal√Æla-symphonie Charles Dutoit and the Philadelphia Orchestra; James Conlon and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra; Miguel Harth- Bedoya and the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra; and Simone Young and the Philharmoniker Hamburg. Other orchestral engagements have included appearances with Washington's National Symphony Orchestra, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, and twice in Carnegie Hall with The New York Pops. Wu has also played as a recitalist: She made her solo debut in Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall in 2005, and has performed at the Ravinia Festival and the International Keyboard Institute & Festival, as well as the Alice Tully Hall, Cleveland Play House (in the Cleveland International Piano Competition), the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the Bass Performance Hall in Texas, and more. In Europe, she has presented recitals at festivals such as Mozart Gesellschaft Dortmund, Klavier Festival Ruhr, and the Busoni International Piano Festival, and at venues such as the Musee de Grenoble and Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris. Critical Reception Praised in The Wall Street Journal as a \\"most mature and sensitive pianist\\" Benjamin Ivry, \\"What Was The Jury Thinking?\\", The Wall Street Journal (June 10, 2009). In Washington, D.C., she was hailed for her \\"fire and authority\\";Anne Midgette, \\"A Pianist Bests Her Venue\\", The Washington Post (January 18, 2010). in Philadelphia, for her \\"charisma, steely technique and keen musical intelligence\\"; and in San Francisco, where the San Francisco Classical Voice critic wrote, \\"what distinguishes Di Wu from her contemporaries is the level of musical maturity she possesses, her exacting attention to details, and the way she opens her vision of the world to the audience. The sensitivity she possesses and the loving care she lavishes on the most minute details of the music is nothing short of phenomenal\\".Ken Iisaka, \\"Di Wu‚Äôs Synesthetic World\\", San Francisco Classical Voice. In 2011, Wu impressed critics in a performance in Seattle, as a late substitute for ailing pianist Michael Brown.Bernard Jacobson, \\"Pianist Di Wu wows Olympic Music fest audience\\", The Seattle Times (September 4, 2011). The Seattle Times critic wrote of Wu's performance: Wu's recording of Brahms's Variations on a Theme of Paganini, Books I and II received praise from Musical America's Harris Goldsmith, who wrote, \\"Her account of the Brahms is amazing. She takes all the difficult options (her glissandos are unbelievable!), and she conjures from the piano absolutely gossamer, violinistic textures, joyous humor, and brilliant air-borne tempos\\".Harris Goldsmith, American Record Guide review of Di Wu in concert Competitions Winner of multiple awards, including, in 2009 alone, a coveted prize at the Thirteenth Van Cliburn International Piano Competition; The Juilliard School‚Äôs Petschek Award; and the Vendome Virtuosi prize at Lisbon‚Äôs prestigious Vendome Competition.

Abrams and Josh Reims that aired NBC from September 22 to December 29, 2010. They were executive producers of the pilot along with Abrams' frequent collaborator Bryan Burk. Because of low ratings, the show was canceled on November 4, 2010. Two episodes were unaired in the United States, but aired in Australia on January 2 and 9, 2012. Premise Five years after leaving the CIA to open a catering company, Steven and Samantha Bloom are recruited back into the agency by Carlton Shaw. They take on special missions the average agent cannot handle. Having made a pact to never discuss their pasts with each other, the Blooms find surprising new things about their spouse in the course of each mission. They are aided by Leo Nash, a top agent who was once Samantha's boyfriend, and geeky computer expert Bill Hoyt, who worships Steven. Lizzy is Samantha's sister, a recovering alcoholic who helps run the catering business and is unaware of what the Blooms are really up to. The Blooms are unaware that Shaw has a secret agenda for reactivating them. Production On May 3, 2010 Undercovers was officially ordered to series by NBC for a fall premiere, Wednesdays at 8/7c. Undercovers premiered on Wednesday, September 22, making it the second spy series produced by Alias executive producer Abrams. Abrams directed the Undercovers pilot; it was the first time he had directed a pilot since 2004's Lost premiere and the first episode of television he has directed since a 2007 episode of The Office. Abrams said of the show, \\"This show does have ongoing stories as well but they are much more personal based and character based. But I'm trying to do a show that has a more fun energy and a little more [comedy]...\\" And on his decision to direct the pilot, Abrams explained that \\"I just enjoyed the idea of it. I enjoy the script‚Ä¶ I enjoyed the chemistry of these two people and it became clear as we were working on it, rather than be sitting on the set every day with someone else directing it, being annoying, I‚Äôd rather just take the burden on myself.\\" The show has been described as a \\"stand-alone adventure every week\\" and a \\"modernized Hart to Hart\\", although Abrams announced just before its cancellation that the show would be starting a serialized storyline concerning the true reasons for the Blooms' reactivation. On November 4, 2010, after weeks of poor viewership and ratings, NBC canceled the series. The show's final three episodes aired in December 2010. Two episodes remain unaired, but NBC has no plans to broadcast them in the immediate future. Warner Home Video has not yet announced if the complete series will be released on DVD and/or Blu-ray. In May 2011, all 13 episodes of the first season were premiered in the UK on Virgin Media as an On Demand program by WarnerTV. In an interview, Abrams talked about the failure of the show: \\"I‚Äôve got to say, I feel like it was unfortunate. Of course, I completely blame myself for the entire thing. The conceit of the show was to do a much more frivolous, fun show, but ultimately, I think it was just too frivolous and too simple, and we didn‚Äôt go deep enough. We were really desperately trying to stay away from mythology and complexity and intensity and too much serious, dark storytelling and, ultimately, that‚Äôs not necessarily what I do best. I think audiences felt that it was a little bit lacking. I see that and completely take responsibility for its failing. In retrospect, Undercovers did end up employing a notable writing staff, many of whom have gone on to become successful head writers and Showrunners of other shows (Karin Gist, Showrunner of Star and Mixed-ish; Anthony Sparks, Showrunner of the Ava DuVernay created Queen Sugar; Elwood Reid, Showrunner of The Bridge; and Phil Klemmer, Showrunner of Legends of Tomorrow.

Chaosmos Citizen K, L'Instant T www.citizen-k.comDeux tableaux de la s√©rie Chaosmos de Richard Texier In 2009, Texier began a series of special paintings entitled Chaosmos. This ongoing work includes more than a hundred paintings. The word Chaosmos was first used in 1939 by James Joyce in Finnegans Wake, whereby he states that the universe cannot function without embracing the concept of chaos. Moreover, the cosmos and chaos are indissolubly united in a vast continuum of order and disorder. At the beginning of the 1970s, Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari revisited the Joycian cosmos, notably in their \\"Mille Plateaux\\", affirming that \\"chaos is not the opposite of rhythm, it is more the center of all centers\\". It is literally this center of all centers that Texier, as an artistic astrophysicist attempts to define, and restore. Chaosmos is none other than a celebration of energy as a concentration of the history of the world.

The series is based on the principle of The Cathedral of Rouen by Monet, or by the limitless modern artistic propositions of a conceptual nature. The paintings in this series are both photos and paintings. The image is obtained by using a digital graphic palette and aims to confuse by placing the real in the false and vice versa. The intention is not to trouble or perplex but rather to inspire and encourage the viewer to look beyond simple appearances. The choice of \\"vortex\\" in the naming of the work is explicit.

I baptised it Elastog√©n√®se as it is firstly an artistic rendering of dreams, Yves Tanguy never called it that even if he used it frequently. It is also a tool, a means of embracing reality. It is very different from the virtual world which attempts to dematerialise reality, Elastog√©n√®se on the contrary chooses matter. It is, however something soft, elastic, in motion and restless. This form of movement exists already in nature, and these natural elements prove in a dazzling manner that the soft is stronger than the hard, and that the proof of their elastic, changeable and adaptable nature is finally more elegant than the rigidity of the real.(‚Ä¶) The art world was the first to discover and explore this nature. The sculptures of Arp, the soft watches of Dali, the expansions of C√®sar, and the silicons of Matthew Barney are all intuitive versions I offer a principal of mental resolution, a means of magical thinking.(‚Ä¶)¬ª :Citation de Richard Texier, dans Nager, , a story, published by √âditions Gallimard in Collection Blanche, Paris, .

It stars Kiyoshi Atsumi as Torajir≈ç Kuruma (Tora-san), and Yukiyo Toake as his love interest or \\"Madonna\\". (official site) Tora-san's Lullaby is the fourteenth entry in the popular, long-running Otoko wa Tsurai yo series. It marks the debut of actor Masami Shimoj≈ç in the role of Tora-san's Uncle Tatsuz≈ç. The third actor in this role, Shimoj≈ç would play the character until the end of the series. Synopsis During his travels Tora-san meets a troubled father with a baby. He shares a drink with the man who then abandons the baby into Tora-san's care. At his hometown in Shibamata, Tokyo, the family is worried about who will take care of the family shop once Tora-san's aunt and uncle have died. Tora-san arrives with the baby causing family and neighbors to speculate that he is the father. The family takes the sickly baby to the hospital where Tora- san falls in love with the nurse, causing complications. The baby's father returns, clearing up misunderstandings.

He judges the relationship between the baby and Tora-san's Aunt Tsune to be one of the best aspects of the film. It is remembered from films past that Tsune has no children, and that Tora-san and his sister were adopted by their aunt and uncle. The German-language site molodezhnaja gives Tora- san's Lullaby three out of five stars. Availability Tora-san's Lullaby was released theatrically on December 28, 1974.

Biography Born in Naples, Italy, Satta Flores graduated from the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in the Italian capital city of Rome. He began acting in amateur dramatics at the Piccolo Teatro, where he acted in Shakespeare and Sbragia plays. He made his cinema debut in the film The Lizards (I basilischi), premiered by filmmaker Lina Wertm√ºller in 1963. In 1971, Satta Flores appeared in the film Four Flies on Grey Velvet but did not really establish himself in cinema until 1974, when he appeared in Ettore Scola's film We All Loved Each Other So Much where he shared leading roles with Stefania Sandrelli, Vittorio Gassman, Nino Manfredi, Aldo Fabrizi and Giovanna Ralli. Satta Flores also appeared in the 1973 films The Funny Face of the Godfather and Teresa the Thief. His last film appearance before his death was in One Hundred Days in Palermo. He was best known for playing a variety of roles in more than 60 films. He was also a voice dubber. His role as the smuggler and rakish hero Han Solo (portrayed by Harrison Ford) in the Italian dub of the Star Wars original trilogy was instrumental in establishing the importance of star power in Italian voice acting. He also used his voice talents in Alien, as the fearless Captain Dallas, as well as in 10, as the romantically-obsessed songwriter George Webber. An eloquent spokesman on artistic and social issues of the day, he also was a respected playwright and occasionally acted in television programs. A political commitment, he founded the company I compagni di scena (The Companions of the Scene) with which he devoted himself to research work on alternative tests. Death Satta Flores died in Rome on October 22nd 1985 at the age of 48 years, following complications from leukemia treatment. In the Italian version of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the voice of Han Solo was passed on to Harrison Ford's regular Italian dub actor Michele Gammino.

The present building dates from the 16th century, but a church has stood on the site since at least the 7th century. From 1451 to 1807, it was the city's cathedral church, though hardly playing the usual dominant role of a cathedral, as it was overshadowed by the \\"state church\\" of San Marco, and inconveniently located. During its history the church has undergone a number of alterations and additions by some of Venice's most prominent architects. Andrea Palladio received his first commission in the city of Venice from the Patriarch Vincenzo Diedo to re-build the facade and interior of St Pietro, but Diedo's death delayed the project. After St Mark's Basilica became Venice‚Äôs official cathedral (it had previously been the private church of the Doge), San Pietro fell into a state of disrepair. It was firebombed during the First World War and only through the efforts of conservation organisations has it been restored to its former state. Its ongoing conservation is now managed through its membership of the Chorus Association of Venetian churches. The church is located on San Pietro di Castello (from which it derives its name), a small island off the eastern end of the main city of Venice. History The earliest structure on the site dates from the 7th century. It was one of the eight churches founded by St. Magnus (), the Bishop of Oderzo, who came to the Venetian lagoon during this period. At the time there was no city but simply a collection of small communities scattered throughout the marshy islands. In a vision St. Peter () appeared to Magnus and instructed him to found a church where he saw oxen and sheep grazing side by side. The location was found and St. Magnus built the church, dedicating it to St. Peter.In an alternative version of the legend, St. Magnus found the location already had a church on it dedicated to another Saint. In this version Magnus had the church re-built and re-dedicated it to St. Peter. The first Bishop of Castello was invested in 1091. In 1120 a fire destroyed the church requiring a new structure to be built. This was grander than the previous building (as seen on a map drawn by Jacopo de' Barbari in 1500) and had an adjoining baptistery dedicated to St. John the Baptist (since destroyed). In 1451, and despite being some distance from the political and economic centre of the city, San Pietro became the seat of the Patriarch of Venice. Following this the building began to see significant investment. During the 1480s Mauro Codussi rebuilt the church's campanile using white Istrian stone, the first example of this seen in Venice. Between 1508 and 1524 the Patriarch Antonio Contarini restored the floors and ceiling. At the same time minor chapels were re-built and the church was decorated with new furnishings. In 1558 Andrea Palladio, in his first commission in the city of Venice, prepared an improved design for the facade and interior of San Pietro. However, the Patriarch who had commissioned Palladio, Vincenzo Diedo, died before the plans could be implemented. Later, between 1594 and 1596 the architect Francesco Smeraldi implemented a modified and less ambitious version of Palladio's original design, the changes possibly attributable to a lack of funds. In 1807 St Mark's Basilica became Venice‚Äôs official cathedral church instead of San Pietro. After 1807 the church saw increased neglect and suffered from firebomb damage during First World War. It wasn't until conservation organisations intervened during the 1970s that the church was restored to its former condition. The church itself is a member of the Chorus Association of Venetian Churches. Exterior The church exhibits a muted facade compared to other Palladian designs in Venice. It features a prominent set of four engaged columns with Composite capitals supporting the main pediment and entablature. This is then flanked by a double broken pediment. The church has a large dome which indicates the church's ecclesiastical importance, sharing an affinity with San Giorgio Maggiore and Il Redentore both churches designed by Palladio. The dome is supported on a drum which has rectangular windows cut into it to let light into the building. The church's campanile is one of the most precarious in Venice. San Pietro di Castello (Campanile).jpgBell tower San Pietro di Castello (Venice) Abside.jpgThe Basilica view from the lagoon. San_Pietro_di_Castello_(il_campo).jpgCampo San Pietro. Interior Interior The building has a large central nave with Latin aisles. The transept crosses the church, separating the nave from the presbytery. The crossing point is capped by a large dome. The Vendramin Chapel, located off the left aisle, was designed by the baroque architect Baldassarre Longhena, as was the high altar which he constructed during the middle of the 17th century. The organ was constructed by the Dalmatian craftsman Pietro Nachini who was working in Venice during the 18th century. Throne of St Peter Artwork The church contains only a few notable works of art including SS John the Evangelist, Peter and Paul by Paolo Veronese and the altarpiece in the Vendramin Chapel by Luca Giordano. The church also contains the Throne of St Peter, a 13th-century seat cut from a funeral stone.

It admitted its first class of 75 students in August 2012. Concordia Law is the second law school in Idaho and the first in Boise, residing in a university-owned campus at 501 West Front Street near the Idaho State Capitol. The school is currently part of Concordia University, a private Lutheran university based in Portland, Oregon but has announced that it would close at the end of the summer 2020 term in connection with the closure of its parent institution. History Concordia University announced it would open a law school in 2007, with the school looking at locations in Washington, California, and Idaho. In November of that year the small Lutheran school announced they were looking at Boise as the location under consideration in Idaho. Boise is the state‚Äôs most populous city and one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States that did not have a law school. Proposed locations included using Boise‚Äôs Carnegie Library on a temporary basis. frameless The law school was originally scheduled to open in 2009, but an increase in the start-up costs from $4 million to $7 million delayed the planned opening to allow for additional fund-raising. Idaho's only law school, the University of Idaho's (UI) College of Law in Moscow, north, also had plans to open a campus in the city at that time. In August 2008, Concordia announced the school would be delayed until the fall of 2010, and Idaho‚Äôs Board of Education decided against allowing UI to add a full three-year program in Boise. Instead, UI would be allowed to open a program for third-year students, also to open in fall 2010. Concordia narrowed its search for a dean of the law school to two people by August 2008, and in December 2008 choose former Idaho Court of Appeals judge and Idaho Supreme Court justice Cathy Silak to lead the school. Expected to cost $7 million and take 18-months to open, the original plan called for an entering class of 70 students in fall 2010 with a faculty of 15. By December 2008 Concordia had raised $1.5 million for the law school and by 2009 had pushed the opening back to fall 2011. Concordia announced plans to buy a building at 501 Front Street in Boise in January 2010 to house the campus. The purchase was expected to close in April and be for about $2 million. Concordia announced in January 2010 it planned to open in fall 2012 with 75-95 students and an annual tuition of around $28,500, with enrollment projected to later increase to 250. The school planned to apply for provisional accreditation by the American Bar Association (ABA) after its first year of operation (fall 2013). The school opened in August 2012 with 75 students. In July 2014, the ABA withheld provisional accreditation from the school, with 48 of 102 students at the school then transferring, taking a leave of absence, or withdrawing from Concordia. The ABA planned to seek additional information, and the school hoped to gain provisional accreditation later in 2014. In August 2014, the ABA continued Concordia‚Äôs application for provisional approval. The ABA sent a fact-finding team to Boise in September 2014 and the Council granted ABA Provisional Approval on June 6, 2015. On June 8, 2015, Concordia announced that the law school had received provisional accreditation from the ABA.Roberts, Bill, \\"Boise‚Äôs Concordia law school wins provisional accreditation,\\" Idaho Statesman, 8 June 2015. Retrieved 28 December 2015. On August 8, 2015, Concordia graduated its first law school class. On May 14, 2016, Boise State University and Concordia Law launched a joint law degree program that allows students to complete their undergraduate and law school education in six years: three years at Boise State, followed by the three-year juris doctor program at Concordia Law. Concordia Law currently has similar 3+3 partnerships with its main campus in Portland, along with Concordia University Texas and Concordia University St. Paul. After founding dean Cathy R. Silak was promoted to vice president of community engagement in June 2016, Concordia University launched a nationwide search for a dean of the School of Law. Following the national search, Concordia University-Portland appointed Elena Langan as the new dean of the law school and she began her new role in January 2017.https://law.cu-portland.edu/news/concordia-university- school-law-hires-new-dean The Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar of the American Bar Association granted full ABA approval to Concordia University School of Law at its meeting on February 21, 2019. On March 1, 2019, Concordia University School of Law announced its full ABA approval. In early 2020, Concordia University in Portland announced that it would close at the end of the spring semester as it faced significant financial challenges. The law school subsequently announced its plans to affiliated with Concordia University in St. Paul, Minnesota. However, the law school was unable to reach a final agreement with Concordia-St. Paul and announced in June 2020 that it would close at the end of the summer term. Campus frameless frameless The law school building is in downtown Boise at 501 West Front Street near the Idaho State Capitol, the Ada County Courthouse and the Idaho Supreme Court buildings. Concordia chose to add a law school in Boise over its main Portland campus primarily since Portland already has one law school with Lewis & Clark Law School and Salem just south of Portland has Willamette University College of Law. Additionally, Concordia has strong ties to the Boise area with students, donors, and several board of trustees coming from Boise, plus Boise was one of the largest metropolitan areas lacking a law school, yet is home to the state supreme court and about half of all the lawyers in Idaho. The first building on the campus was a two-story brick building with of space. The law school completed construction in 2010 of a three story extension of the original building located directly South of the existing structure to add for more offices and classrooms. The school's library is known as the George R. White Law Library. The library occupies the largest part of the building and is located in the north wing. The library houses a collection of electronic and print resources, and provides its law students with study carrels, group study rooms, a popular reading and conversation room, and a copy center. The Concordia University School of Law campus is a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified building. frameless 5th & Front The Concordia University School of Law has launched 5th & Front to provide pro-bono legal services to the community, and house legal clinic and mentorship opportunities for its students.5th & Front provides access to legal services for underserved populations ‚Äì such as juveniles, veterans, immigrants, refugees, and families living in poverty. Clinics cover a wide range of issues, such as housing, asylum and citizenship, domestic violence, wills and estate planning, and more.  Grants and scholarships  Each student at the law school receives a service grant of $15,000 ($5,000 per year for full-time students and prorated based on the number of credits taken each term for part-time students). Merit-based scholarships range from $3,000 to $14,000 each year and are renewable for students who remain in good academic standing.

He was also an honorary member of the Academy of Military Medical, the Mikhailovsky Artillery School, the Mykolaiv Engineering School, the Imperial Academy of Sciences,Profile of Vannovsky on the official website of the Russian Academy of Sciences and a full knight of the Order of St. Vladimir. Born in Kiev into a family of Belarusian landed gentry, Vannovsky chose his career early on in his life and began military schooling. After a few years, he participated in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and the Crimean War as part of the Life Guards Finnish Regiment, distinguishing himself at the Siege of Silistra, he was highly decorated after the war, becoming the head of his own regiment, and several military schools. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878, he took the prominent role as the chief of staff of the Ruschuk Detachment, under the Tsesarevich, future emperor Alexander III. Taking part in many minor but important campaigns, especially a campaign for breaking the Siege of Plevna and the battle between Trastenik and Mechka. For his and Alexander's achievements, they were both awarded the Order of St. George of the 3rd and 2nd degree respectively. A few years after the war, Alexander ascended to the throne, and Vannnovsky was subsequently appointed Minister of War. Vannovsky was one of the most successful Minister of War during the course of the Russian Empire, he was in office during most of the reign of Emperor Alexander III and the early reign of Emperor Nicholas II from 1881 to 1898, he was credited with maintaining order, preventing corruption and reforming the Russian military during his role as the Minister of War. But after Vannovsky resigned, he had warned the military about modern war tactics, should the general's warning be remembered by the generals of the next generation (those who served in the Russo-Japanese War and the First World War), the Russian performance in the Russo-Japanese War and the First World War would have been completely different. He also briefly served as the Minister of National Education from 1901 to 1902. After which he retired and died suddenly in 1904 following the Russo-Japanese War, perhaps dying upon learning of the disastrous war with Japan. Early life Coat of arms of the Vannovsky Family (granted in 1892) Pyotr Semyonovich Vannovsky was born in Kiev to Semyon Ivanovich Vannovsky, who was from the Gentry Vannovsky family of Belarusian origin from Minsk. His father Semyon was a well-educated man who taught French in the 1st Kiev Gymnasium. And Pyotr, followed to the Vannovsky Family tradition to choose his future career at a young age, he chose to serve in the military and was strongly supported by his father. So as a result, he moved to Moscow and attended the 1st Moscow Cadet Corps, one of the best cadet corps in Russia. Upon graduating, he joined the Life Guards Finnish Regiment, and participated in the Hungarian Revolution against the Hungarian Revolutionaries and the Crimean War as part of the three Finnish battalion Vannovsky's regiment belonged to. In mid 1854, he and the battalions met the Ottomans near the Ottoman villages of Tutrakan and Silistra, and the Siege of Silistra took place. He distinguished himself as a brave but sane soldier during the siege. Later for military distinction, he was awarded the Order of St. Vladimir of the 4th degree with swords and a bow, and was subsequently appointed the commander of his own regiment. After hostility ended in 1857, he became the head of several military schools, and thanks to his efforts, many infantry officers had been trained to take up the post of small unit commander and managing weapons, and those who graduated in the first category was granted the next rank ahead of the schedule. He was later promoted to major-general in 1861. In 1868, he was promoted to lieutenant-general and was appointed commander of the 12th Infantry Division, this division consisted of the 46th Infantry Regiment of the Dnieper, the 47th infantry Ukraine regiment, 48th infantry Odessa Emperor Alexander I regiment. General Vannovsky, was an overly uncautious man, but unlike the next generation of his (those who served in WW1), he was a well disciplined commander. Constantly going through the life of his men in the army, and carefully engaging in the training of soldiers, making it one of the best division in the Imperial Russian Army. Later he was then appointed chief of staff of the 12th Army Corps in 1871, in which he eventually commanded in the Russo-Turkish War in 1877. In 1876, General Vannovsky was appointed chief of staff of the newly formed 33rd Infantry Division, which included the 129th Infantry Regiment of Bessarabia, the 130th Infantry Regiment of Kherson, the 131st Infantry Regiment of Tiraspol and the 132nd Infantry Regiment of Bendery. It was an pretty challenging task to form a new unit, but with a determined general such as Vannovsky, he coped with the task easily, which he was noted by the high command of the Kiev Military District. Russo-Turkish War Portrait of Captain Vannovsky, 1849 At the beginning of the Russo-Turkish War, he commanded the 12th Army Corps to crossed the Danube, the Army Corps was later incorporated into the Ruschuk Detachment (the Eastern Detachment), for which he was appointed chief of staff of it, commanded by the tsesarevich, the future emperor Alexander III, whom he would become close friend with after the war. The Ruschuk Detachment was exceptionally powerful among other Russian units. It was composed of the 12th and the 13th Army Corps, 49 battalions, 19 Cossack divisions and 224 guns. The task of the detachment was to take the small Ottoman towns of Ruse and Nikopol, but when they arrived, they were attacked by the Ottomans and as a result, they went fully defensive, but they could still break through the Ottomans and won significant victories. Later on the Ottomans attempted to launch an offensive between the villages of Gorsko Ablanovo and Katselovo, but the Russians repulsed them, inflicting huge casualties on the Ottoman. After this decisive battle, the Ottomans did not dare to launch any offensive for a period of time. After some time, the Ottoman high command made a decision to attack the right flank and the center of the Ruschuk Detachment with 28 squadrons and 84 guns, in order to encircle the detachment from the rear. But the plan was later unravelled by Vannovsky, and the Russian Army soon went to defensive position. On 9 September, when the Ottomans attacked, they got counter-attacked by the Russians, inflicting huge casualties on the Ottomans. This victory was very important for the breakthrough in Plevna because the rear of the army was now protected from being attacked. Now with Plevna captured, Commander-in-chief Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich changed the original plan completely, the Ruschuk Detachment went completely defensive, with the task of continue protecting the Russian rear. Battle at Trastenik and Mechka On 14 November, Suleiman Pasha with his men tried strike the Russian Army rear once again, and a decisive battle took place between the Bulgarian villages of Trastenik and Mechka. During the battle, the Ottomans, having superiority in manpower and artilleries, went on an offensive, inflicting the main blow at the right flank of the Russian Army. And the Russians, led by Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, decided to retreat. Further unravelling revealed that the Ottomans planned to play defensive against the left and center of the Russians, and concentrate the troops to strike on the right flank of them. The battle developed well for the Russians, later with the support of the 2nd Brigade of the 35th Infantry Division, a Ukrainian Regiment and reinforced by the cavalry of , the Ruschuk Detachment advanced and launched an attack on the left flank of the Ottomans. The Ottomans' defense broke and the center and left flank of the Ruschuk Detachment went on an offensive, during which Ottoman troops completely brokedown. In this battle, the Ruschuk Detachment's casualties were about 850 men, and the Ottomans lost more than 3,000 men. Later, for Bravery and military distinction in the battle, the Tsesarevich was awarded the Order of St. George of the 2nd degree, the highest military decoration in the Russian Empire. While General Vannovsky was appointed General Adjutant and awarded the order of the 3rd degree with the inscription \\"As a reward of courage, bravery and orderliness rendered in affairs against the Turks and active participation in the repulse of repeated enemy attacks on the positions occupied by the troops of the 12th and 13th Army Corps\\". After that astounding victory, the Ruschuk Detachment would continued carrying out defensive tasks. The Ruschuk Detachment by this time was considered to be the road to victory by many Russian officer through all the minor but extremely important tasks successfully carried out by the detachment. By the end of the year, the Russian high command described the actions of the Ruschuk Detachment over the war as follow: Later, the Ruschuk Detachment was tasked with interrupting the Ottoman communication line between Ruse and Shumen, in order to capture Silistra. In January, they fulfilled the order, interrupting the Ottoman communication between Ruse and Shumen, and captured Silistra. After the battle, Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich offered the Tsesarevich to go on a vacation, he refused and was accepted by the Grand Duke, this would eventually contribute to the development of the successful career of Vannovsky: Vannovsky's detachment was actually the first in Russian military history to receive biscuits as food, rather than having bread, to reduce possibility of getting the Gastrointestinal disease. This practice then proceeded to extend throughout the Russian Army. During the war, General Vannovsky showed his talent as a chief of staff, and after the war, he was appointed adjutant- general and commander of the Eastern (later renamed Northern) Detachment. After he was appointed to the detachment, he used this chance to organize the troops as an independent commander, which would soon prove very useful after he became the Minister of War. After a year or so, he was again appointed commander of the 12th Army Corps, the corps that he commanded prior to the war. In 1881, Alexander III ascended to the throne, and many liberal government officials of Alexander II were removed from office, including Minister of War Count Milyutin. After Milyutin's dismissal, Vannovsky was appointed manager of the Ministry of War. Minister of War In 1862, during the turbulent student protests of Kiev and St. Petersburg, occurring near the Palace Bridge, Vannovsky was called in to control the students. But he found conditions disagreeable, and released almost all students charged with sedition against the university. The Anarchist Peter Kropotkin opined that, \\"A military officer had thus to interfere for the defense of the students against the Ministry of Public Instruction.\\" As the Minister of War, the general carry out a strict discipline rule in the army, and life in the military greatly changed, the following were the reforms General Vannovsky carried out: 1\\\\. Devices in military control * The post of Inspector General of the Cavalry and the Inspector General of Engineers were abolished, the duties of which were assigned to the Minister of War. * Artillery units that made up army corps were transferred from the artillery commanders to be subordinated by the corps commander, aiming to unite all units in the hands of the superiors responsible for the corps during peace and wartimes. * Mortar field shelves were formed, beginning of transition of batteries to shelves, as to separate from artillery units. * Additional artillery, infantry and active infantry units were strengthened, and new cavalry cadres were formed. * Management of fortresses were changed, commandants of their responsible fortresses were appointed owner of it, and were responsible for all of its condition and preparation for mobilization. * Hunting teams were established and were organised into units, in purposes of developing soldiers' courage. * Local military administrations were simplified, the posts of chief of local military and provincial military commander were abolished. * Field control of troops during wartime was changed, military district, when mobilized, now had to appeal directly to the field office, and special units for that were formed. * Small cadres (including companies, hundreds and batteries) were formed for soldiers and an organization was established in purposes of calling soldiers to training camps. 2\\\\. Organization of the army The main ideas of Vannovsky's reforms was to increase the combat part of armed forces at the expense of reducing non- combat elements without needing to increase the overall strength of the army: * In 1881, the infantry consisted of 879,500 lower rank soldiers, and the cavalry consisted of 137,000 horses. But after the reform of General Vannovsky, the infantry was decreased to only 879,500 infantrymen, and the cavalry was increased to 137,250 horses. * The number of local non-combat troops were also lowered, instead of 10,000 troops, now there were only 2,400 of them, and the 52,000 troops scattered around numerous departments and establishment, were decreased to 43,000. * Armed force was increased to 599,000 lower rank officers and 78,500 horses. A special attention was paid to increase the existing number of high rank officers in the active army and to reduce the number of inactive army officers (about a thousand of them were dismissed). * The regular cavalry was strengthened, many Hussar and Lancer regiments were converted into Dragoon regiments and the number of cossack regiments were increased. * Many infantry battalions were converted into regiments. * The number of existing rifle units were increased. * 4 new regiments and squads were formed in the Caucasus Viceroyalty as reserve troops, and the Finland as well, having 8 new infantry battalions and dragoons formed as reserve troops. * Field and fortress artilleries, engineering troops, railway brigades were all strengthened. 3\\\\. Recruitment of troops * In 1874, significant changes by General Milyutin were conducted in the charter for military service and a new disciplinary charter center was formed in 1888. * The service for compulsory troops was reduced by 1 year, and the service for reserve troops was increased by 4 years. Minister of War Pyotr Vannovsky, c. 1880 During his time of being Minister of War, he, together with the Minister of the Interior Count Tolstoy, had very bad relations with General Iosif Gurko, their relations could only be smoothened by Mikhail Ostrovsky, the Ministry of State Property, who kept a good relation between the three of them.

The museum was built in order to house the artifacts and archaeological findings discovered around Trowulan and its vicinity. The location is one of the more important in Indonesia in relation to tracing the history of Majapahit Most of the museum collections is originated from the Majapahit era, however the collections also covered the era of Kahuripan, Kediri, and Singhasari kingdoms in East Java. The museum is located on the western side of the kolam Segaran. Trowulan museum has the largest collection of Majapahit relics in Indonesia. History A sculpture depicting Samodramanthana, the churning of sea of milk. The Trowulan Museum's history is intertwined with Trowulan archaeological site itself. The ancient city ruins at Trowulan had been discovered by the 19th century. Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, governor of Java from 1811 until 1816 reported the existence of ruins of temples scattered about the country for many miles. Much of the region was blanketed with dense teak forest at that time, making detailed survey difficult. The urgent need to prevent looting and stealing from Trowulan archaeological site was one of the main reasons to build a simple archaeological storage building that became the old Trowulan Museum.Which still continues - http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2009/02/17/trowulan-locals-campaign- to-preserve-majapahit/ It was established by Henri Maclaine Pont, a Dutch architect and archaeologist, and the Mojokerto regent Kanjeng Adipati Ario Kromodjojo Adinegoro. The new museum was officially opened in 1987. Covering a spacious area of some 57,625 square metres, this new site accommodates the collection of the old Trowulan Museum, as well as the bulk of the stone sculpture which used to be housed in the museum of Mojokerto. A newer museum is also proposed for the area http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/01/07/putting-trowulan- perspective.html and the location has been proposed as a World Heritage area https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5466/ Collection A maquette of Jawi temple. Today the museum not only houses the archaeological relics from Majapahit era, but also collects and displays various archaeological relics discovered all over East Java. From the era of King Airlangga, Kediri, to the era of Singhasari and Majapahit. Large collections of Hindu-Buddhist stone sculptures as well as Majapahit Terracotta art also displayed in the museum. Among the objects on display, include the famous portrait statue of Airlangga portrayed as Vishnu mounting Garuda, from Candi Belahan. A winged figure which is said to portray the legendary king of Blambangan, Menak Jinggo. A part of Candi recovered from a site at Ampelgading Malang.

Several of the island's most popular bachata musicians, such as Luis Vargas and Antony Santos, have labeled Louis the father of Bachata music. Loizides has been a strong proponent of the \\"Power Bachata\\" movement, which uses a combination of the electric guitar and harpsichord. This movement never caught on, and as a result Loizides slipped from notoriety and has since retired. But many think he will make a comeback and he has started to tour several venues in the United States. Beginnings Unlike most bachata singers, Loizides was born in Cuba. He built a raft to escape Castro's regime in the early 1960s. Originally he intended to travel towards Miami, but he had a passion for Dominican culture and set sail for the Dominican Republic. There is some dispute about this. Several sources believe that Loizides did not sail in the right direction and went towards the Dominican Republic by mistake. He settled in Puerto Plata in 1965. He worked in a local bar/brothel and learned to play the guitar for its customers in order to earn tips. While the earliest bachata recording is usually attributed to Jos√© Manuel Calder√≥n in 1961, Loizides is considered by many to be the influential founder of the bachata movement. Legacy Loizides is credited with the invention of several new bachata dancing patterns including the turn- style dip and cross-front return. These patterns are traditionally used on his birthday, March 11, by many notable bachateros. In 2013 several rumors of Loizides' death circulated throughout the Bachata community in the Dominican Republic, but none of these rumors have had much credibility.

Looney Tunes animated short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on February 24, 1951, and stars Tweety and Sylvester. Plot Tweety is shoveling snow from his nest when, from the windows of brownstone apartments across the street from each other, Sylvester and a red cat with one green eye notice him. They both race to capture him, only to realize they will have to battle each other. The two cats must constantly one-up each other, and they take turns successfully taking possession of Tweety, but the bird always slips away and the cats end up getting hurt. Tweety seems to be enjoying himself (i.e. sharing a drink with a \\"pwaymate\\" bird, which is actually a perpetual-motion machine, asking the red cat to take him for a ride again, after having slid with the unconscious feline down a staircase). The cartoon hits its climax when the cats chase the bird to a frozen pond on which is posted a sign warning of thin ice. It appears Tweety has fallen in, his hat is next to a hole near the center of the pond. The cats slip and slide over and, while the red one puts a paw in to see if he can find Tweety, they both become aware of a chipping sound. Tweety is using an ice pick to cut a circle around the cats. He pauses a moment and asks them to throw his hat to him. They desperately oblige, in a bid for mercy; Tweety thanks them and completes the circle, causing the cats to fall into the frigid water. Tweety is then shown having resumed shoveling snow from his nest. Sylvester and the red cat are in their respective homes, obviously suffering from bad colds (shivering, wrapped in a warm robe, feet in a tub of warm water, sneezing). Tweety says, \\"Gesundheit!\\" to each, looks at the audience and says, \\"The poow putty tats\\", and continues his work as the cartoon ends.

The main emphasis of the interdisciplinarity is placed on the application and use of computer-based but also mathematical techniques in sport science, aiming in this way at the support and advancement of theory and practice in sports. The reason why computer science has become an important partner for sport science is mainly connected with \\"the fact that the use of data and media, the design of models, the analysis of systems etc. increasingly requires the support of suitable tools and concepts which are developed and available in computer science\\". IJCSS Special Edition 2/2006, 25-35.  Historical background  Going back in history, computers in sports were used for the first time in the 1960s, when the main purpose was to accumulate sports information. Databases were created and expanded in order to launch documentation and dissemination of publications like articles or books that contain any kind of knowledge related to sports science. Until the mid-1970s also the first organization in this area called IASI (International Association for Sports Information) was formally established. Congresses and meetings were organized more often with the aim of standardization and rationalization of sports documentation. Since at that time this area was obviously less computer-oriented, specialists talk about sports information rather than sports informatics when mentioning the beginning of this field of science. Based on the progress of computer science and the invention of more powerful computer hardware in the 1970s, also the real history of computer science in sport began. IJCSS Special Edition 2/2006, 36-46. This was as well the first time when this term was officially used and the initiation of a very important evolution in sports science. In the early stages of this area statistics on biomechanical data, like different kinds of forces or rates, played a major role. Scientists started to analyze sports games by collecting and looking at such values and features in order to interpret them. Later on, with the continuous improvement of computer hardware - in particular microprocessor speed ‚Äì many new scientific and computing paradigms were introduced, which were also integrated in computer science in sport. Specific examples are modeling as well as simulation, but also pattern recognition, design, and (sports) data mining. As another result of this development, the term 'computer science in sport' has been added in the encyclopedia of sports science in 2004.  Areas of research  The importance and strong influence of computer science as an interdisciplinary partner for sport and sport science is mainly proven by the research activities in computer science in sport. The following IT concepts are thereby of particular interest: * Data acquisition and data processing * Databases and expert systems * Modelling (mathematical, IT based, biomechanical, physiological) * Simulation (interactive, animation etc.) * Presentation Based on the fields from above, the main areas of research in computer science in sport include amongst others: * Training and coaching * Biomechanics * Sports equipment and technology * Computer-aided applications (software, hardware) in sports * Ubiquitous computing in sports * Multimedia and Internet * Documentation * Education  Research communities  A clear demonstration for the evolution and propagation towards computer science in sport is also the fact that nowadays people do research in this area all over the world. Since the 1990s many new national and international organizations regarding the topic of computer science in sport were established. These associations are regularly organizing congresses and workshops with the aim of dissemination as well as exchange of scientific knowledge and information on all sort of topics regarding the interdisciplinary discipline.  Historical survey  As a first example, in Australia and New Zealand scientists have built up the MathSport group of ANZIAM (Australia and New Zealand Industrial and Applied Mathematics), which since 1992 organizes biennial meetings, initially under the name \\"Mathematics and Computers in Sport Conferences\\", and now \\"MathSport\\".MathSport, www.anziam.org.au Main topics are mathematical models and computer applications in sports, as well as coaching and teaching methods based on informatics. The European community was also among the leading motors of the emergence of the field. Some workshops on this topic were successfully organized in Germany since the late 1980s. In 1997 the first international meeting on computer science in sport was held in Cologne. The main aim was to spread out and share applications, ideas and concepts of the use of computers in sports, which should also make a contribution to the creation of internationalization and thus to boost research work in this area. Since then, such international symposia took place every two years all over Europe. As the first conferences were a raving success, it was decided to go even further and the foundation of an organization was the logical consequence. This step was accomplished in 2003, when the International Association of Computer Science in Sport (IACSS) was established during the 4th international symposium in Barcelona, when Prof. J√ºrgen Perl was also chosen as the first president. A few years earlier, the first international e-journal on this topic (International Journal of Computer Science in Sport) was released already. The internationalization is confirmed moreover by the fact that three conferences already took place outside of Europe - in Calgary (Canada) in 2007, Canberra (Australia) in 2009 and Shanghai (China) in 2011. During the symposium in Calgary additionally the president position changed - it has been assigned to Prof. Arnold Baca, who has been re-elected in 2009 and 2011. The following Symposia on Computer Science in Sport took place in Europe again, in Istanbul (Turkey) in 2013 and in Loughborough (UK) in 2015. In 2017 the 11th Symposium of Computer Science in Sport took place in Constance (Germany). During the conference in Istanbul Prof. Martin Lames was elected as president of the IACSS. He was re-elected in 2015, 2017 and 2019. The 12th International Symposium of Computer Science in Sports was held in Moscow (Russia) from 8 to 10 July 2019: https://iacss2019.ru/  National organizations  In addition to the international associations from above, currently the following national associations on computer science in sport exist (if available, the web addresses are also given): * Austrian Association of Computer Science in Sport - http://www.sportinformatik.at * British Association of Computer Science in Sport and Exercise * Chinese Association of Computer Science in Sport * Croatian Association of Computer Science in Sport * Section Computer Science in Sport of the German Association of Sport Science - http://www.dvs- sportinformatik.de (in German) * Swiss Association of Computer Science in Sport SACSS - http://sacss.org * Indian Federation of Computer Science in Sport - http://www.ifcss.in * Portuguese Association of Computer Science in Sport * Turkish Association of Computer Science in Sport * Russian Association of Computer Science in Sport - https://www.racss.ru/  References  Further reading  * Baca, A.

It contains at least 18 loi (pondfield) terraces once watered by ƒÄhuimanu Stream and associated auwai (irrigation ditches) over about that start from headwaters just below the cliffs of the Koolau Range. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, after windward residents raised concerns about development plans in the area. The Kahaluu Fish Pond was also added to the National Register at that time. The terraces are roughly rectangular in shape and average 5 by 10 meters in size, with front facings of stacked stone ranging up to 2 meters or more in height. The pondfields have all been silted in and are often obscured by heavy overgrowth of hau, mango, and guava trees, but they have withstood many generations of heavy rainfall on steeply sloping hillsides, in silent testimony to ancient Hawaiian expertise in irrigation and flood control. In 1973, a University of Hawaii archaeology program field school excavated soil profiles from the terraces, and the site was cleared during the 1980s, but the State of Hawaii Historic Preservation Division is now seeking community organizations willing to clear the site and make it operational again. The site is owned by Temple Valley Corp., which has continued to develop new houses around it. At the time of the NRHP nomination, the Historic District was said to lie 900 meters west of the west end of Hui Kelu Street and to be accessible via an abandoned jeep road. Even as late as July 1996, a hiker described returning via the jeep road. But Hui Kelu Street has since been extended across ƒÄhuimanu Stream, where the hiking trail begins, and the lower portion of the jeep road is now Heno Place.

Life and career Stock was born in New York City, to Fannie and Fred Stock. His father was Swiss and his mother was English.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2010/01/13/AR2010011304540.html Stock served in the United States Army from 1947 to 1951. Following his discharge, he apprenticed under photographer Gjon Mili. In 1951, he won a first prize in a Life magazine competition for young photographers. That same year, he became an associate member of the photography agency Magnum. He became a full partner-member in 1954. Stock met the actor James Dean in 1955, a few months before the latter's sudden death. He undertook a series of photos of the actor in Hollywood, Dean's hometown in Indiana, and in New York City. One of his portraits of Dean in New York's Times Square became an iconic image of the young star. The black and white picture shows the actor with a pulled up collar on a long coat and a cigarette in his mouth on a rain-soaked, grey day. It later appeared in numerous galleries and on postcards and posters and became one of the most reproduced photographs of the post-war period. From 1957 until the early 1960s, Stock aimed his lens at jazz musicians, photographing such people as Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Sidney Bechet, Gene Krupa and Duke Ellington or Miles Davis ( see for example, Milestones Cover Photo). With this series of photographs he published the book Jazz Street.\\"Magnum Photos Biography\\". Retrieved January 10, 2011.

However, the most recent major review also found similarities between the central Sulawesi specimen and the Togian babirusa, leading them to conclude that it represents an undescribed taxon and that the taxonomic position of central Sulawesi babirusas only can be determined through additional specimens.Meijaard and Groves, 2002, p. 37‚Äì38 Subfossil remains from the south-western arm of Sulawesi, where now likely extinct, have been classified as Bola Batu babirusas, but these were considered unclassifiable in 2002, as were extant populations from the eastern arm of Sulawesi and Buton due to the lack of specimens.Meijaard and Groves, 2002, p. 38 Due to these uncertainties, the IUCN Red List provisionally synonymized B. bolabatuensis under the northern Sulawesi species, B. celebensis, pending clarification of the taxonomy of Sulawesi babirusas.Macdonald et al., 2008 ReferencesLiterature cited *Groves, C. 1980.

The four dots: blue/yellow, red/green used in the splash screen and application icon are a symbolic representation of the Lab color space central to color management technology. History Kodak Proofing Software is derived from the original Creo software used to control the Veris printer. In 2005 Kodak purchased Creo and the software first became internally known as Kodak Proofing Software, whereas Kodak Veris, Kodak APPROVAL and Kodak MATCHPRINT Inkjet are the proofing solutions marketed to customers. Veris 1.6 was released in 2004 by Creo. Much of the actual functionality of the Veris printer is actually embedded in the Veris software. Compared to conventional drop-on-demand inkjet printers the Veris hardware is quite 'dumb' relying on the controller software for most of its high level functions. The Creo Integris proofing solution for drop-on-demand printers was a re-marketed version of software from Best. Best was later bought by EFI.EFI Color Print Management Software Kodak Proofing Software 3.0 was released in fall 2005 which added support for the Epson Stylus Pro drop-on-demand inkjet printers. This was used to replace the previous Integris software. During the acquisition of Creo, Kodak Polychrome Graphics (KPG) had their own proofing solution for inkjet printers known as MATCHPRINT ProofPro, but Kodak decided to replace it with the Veris derived software instead. The trademark MATCHPRINT came from the Imation analog and thermal proofing media. KPG bought Imation, KPG and Creo. The MATCHPRINT name was kept for brand recognition value. Version 3.1A was released summer 2007 which added support for the Kodak APPROVAL proofing system. Version 4.0 was released Summer 2009 which added n-color processing and a new calibration technology known as Precision Color. The previous 4-color technology, known as ColorZone, is not able to handle the new 6 and 7 color printers that have become popular because of their wider color gamut. Also Precision Color introduced a progressive or iterative calibration method that is more accurate than the single shot calibration used in ColorZone. Architecture Kodak Proofing Software is a client/server solution. The server, written in C++ and C#, runs on Windows XP and performs all the fundamental processing of color images and control of the printers. The client, written in Java, runs on Macintosh and Windows computers and presents the user interface to the system. There is a many-to-many relationship between clients and servers. There are two connectivity modes for Kodak Proofing Software: with Direct Connectivity users can submit jobs directly from Prinergy or Brisque workflow systems into Kodak Proofing Software; with Open Connectivity users can just drop press-ready PDF files into hot folders. With Direct Connectivity the raster image processing is performed by Prinergy, whereas with Open Connectivity it is performed internally by Kodak Proofing Software (using a subset of Prinergy technology).

It is the Americanization of the Surname Drowne. Many branches of this family dropped the E during the late 18th century as a part of the American Spelling Reform movement, forming the surname Drown. It is possibly derived from the Middle English word \\"drane\\", or drone, the male honey bee.http://www.houseofnames.com/xq/asp.fc/qx/drown-family-crest.htm The first Drowne/Drown in North America was Leonard Drowne (1646‚Äì1729) who came from Penryn, Cornwall to what was then part of Kittery in Massachusetts soon after the Restoration (England) of the monarchy in 1660. Leonard, a ship-wright, established a shipyard near Sturgeon Creek in what is now Eliot, York County, Maine. Leonard married Sarah Abbott of Portsmouth, New Hampshire around 1675. Leonard helped organize and build the first Baptist Church in Maine in 1682. During King William's War, many Maine towns were raided and English settlements were massacred by the Wabanaki people in conjunction with the French. In 1696, 28 members of the Baptist Church moved to Charleston, South Carolina and established the first Baptist church there while the Drownes moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 1699, due to the ongoing war and violence. After Sarah Abbott died, Leonard married his also-widowed sister-in law, Mary (Abbott) Caley. This marriage was performed by the Rev. Cotton Mather in Boston, November 4, 1707. Leonard Drowne died in Boston, October 31, 1729. Leonard Drowne and other early members of the family are buried in Copps Hill Cemetery in Boston.

He was active in the pop art movement of the 60s.  Biography  Gee was born on July 23, 1932 in Leicestershire, England. He was interested in drawing as a child and worked as a graphic designer for the British army when he joined at the age of 18. By the end of the 50s, he had exhibited at the Denise Rene Gallery in Paris, where he lived briefly, and the Axiom Gallery in London. He came to the US in 1962. Throughout the 60s, Gee experienced a high degree of success as a pop artist in Manhattan. His work from this era has been collected by The Museum of Modern Art in both New York City and Kyoto, The Smithsonian and the Library of Congress in Washington DC, and The Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Gee exhibited with Andy Warhol and Robert Indiana for the \\"Word and Image\\" show in 1968 at the Museum of Modern Art. During this time, he was also teaching classes at the New School, the School of Visual Arts, and the Harvard Architectural School. Gee formed his close friendship with fashion designer Betsey Johnson in the 60s. He designed the art and packages which she used in her Soho-based store Paraphernalia, and Johnson's lips are the subject of many of his silkscreens and gicl√©es.Del Deo, Josephine (9 March 2006) Peter Gee...A Celebration of Color in his Life Provincetown Banner Accessed January 19, 2010. Gee and his wife Elsie had a son named Brandon in 1971. They later divorced, and Gee became involved with antique-dealer Olga Opsahl. They had two children, Odin and Harry, born in 1981 and 1985. In 1989, Gee married Olga at the Round Hill resort near Montego Bay in Jamaica, where he owned property, exhibited his work, and occasionally taught color theory classes to vacationers.  Art  Gee was mainly concerned with color theory throughout his life. Until the 80s, his preferred medium for exploring color combinations was silkscreen printing. He used a series of basic shapes in various combinations, usually bulls-eye targets and very simplified daisies which he would print individually, in long strips, or in larger rectangles which combined many strips of differently colored daisies and targets. He also printed silkscreens of Betsey Johnson and her colleague Penelope Tree, Betsey Johnson's lips, Martin Luther King Jr., and the famous Puck Building in New York City. Gee often printed on silver mylar and metallic gold paper.Alloway, Lawrence \\"The Mass Produced Oasis\\" Arts MagazineBaro, Gene \\"Catalogue Intro, Allan Stone Gallery\\" Later in his life, Gee began to paint with oils. Some of his paintings are color experiments in the same vein as his silkscreens- they involve simple and clearly defined shapes, usually squares and rectangles. Others are still lives, interiors, and nudes. Gee began to make gicl√©e prints using a computer and archival inks some years before his death. Some of these gicl√©es were reproductions or were intended as reproductions, but he considered many of them to be new and original work involving colors that he had been unable to achieve or that he had not thought to try with a silkscreen process decades before. After Gee died, his family and printer made arrangements to complete some limited editions of his gicl√©es using the computer files which Gee had created during his lifetime.Gee, Odin Original Gicl√©es Explained Accessed January 19, 2010.  Work in development and renovation  In addition to pursuing his artistic career, Peter Gee renovated and restored twenty-some historic and unusual buildings in Soho and Tribeca. One of these was the Puck Building, which he operated with his partner Paul Serra in the 80s and early nineties.Daniels, Lee A. (9 February 1983) Real Estate; New Status For Puck Building New York Times Accessed January 19, 2010. In 1994, Gee bought the Cape Cod School of Art in Provincetown Massachusetts and began to restore the buildings while living in the old student dormitories with his family.

Choice Magazine wrote, ‚ÄúThis book becomes the personal testament of a pivotal figure in recent Crow cultural history. The book describes in exquisite detail Yellowtail‚Äôs philosophy. Fitzgerald examines the place of the Sun Dance, and of the sacred, in the life and future of the Crow‚Ä¶ It is a serious work of anthropology and history.‚Äù Choice Magazine Fitzgerald first met Susie Yellowtail, who is now enshrined in the Montana Hall of Fame, when he was Joseph Epes Brown‚Äôs graduate teaching assistant at Indiana University, Bloomington, for ‚ÄúReligious Traditions of the North American Indians‚Äù. Fitzgerald spent the summer of 1971 living with Thomas and Susie Yellowtail on the Crow Indian Reservation in Wyola, Montana, where he participated in the tribal Sun Dance and was adopted into the Yellowtail family and the Crow tribe. Following Dr. Brown‚Äôs 1972 departure to Montana, Fitzgerald taught a course of the same name in the Indiana University (Bloomington) Continuing Studies Department for two years.http://sacredweb.com/contributors/#MichaelOrenFitzgerald Fitzgerald married his wife, Judith, in 1972. The Yellowtails introduced the Fitzgeralds to many spiritual leaders of other American Indian tribes. Over the next forty years Judith and Michael Fitzgerald spent extended periods of time visiting reservations and attending sacred ceremonies throughout the American West, including the sacred rites of the Crow, Sioux, Cheyenne, Shoshone, Bannock, and Apache Tribes. Janine Pease, founding president of the Little Big Horn College, National Indian Educator of the Year and a McArthur Genius Award winner, had this to say about Fitzgerald's relationship with Indian people and cultures: ‚ÄúMichael Fitzgerald has heard the poignant narratives of the American Indian people, and has lived among the Crow people for extended periods of time since 1970. He has studied American Indian religious traditions on the earth, among the people, in ceremonies and family gatherings. We thank Fitzgerald for his deep-seated appreciation, honor, and respect for American Indian culture, its religion, language, and lifeways.‚Äù These contacts led to the creation of a number of books and two documentary films on the American Indians. Fitzgerald has also lectured widely on American Indian history and culture at various colleges and high schools. All royalties from Fitzgerald‚Äôs books and films about American Indians are donated to different American Indian causes or used to perpetuate American Indian spiritual traditions. This includes the Smithsonian‚Äôs Museum of the American Indian, the American Indian College Fund, and the traditional ceremonies of the Crow, Lakota, Apache, and Shoshone. Fitzgerald is both a Director and the Secretary of the Trehero-Trosper Sun Dance Inc., a not-for-profit organization dedicated to the perpetuation of Shoshone traditional ceremonies and culture. As a fierce advocate of preserving indigenous languages, Fitzgerald is a co- founder of the Crow Language Consortium, a subsidiary of the Language Conservancy, and is also a member of the Advisory Board of the Language Conservancy. The Fitzgerald family provides ongoing financial contributions that include underwriting Crow language textbooks and the establishment of a permanent endowment for the Language Conservancy with the Bloomington Community Foundation.

A small, silver-colored fish, it typically lives between deep, though shallower in the summer months. In the early 20th century the Ammersee kilch was an important commercial species, but its population declined drastically in the 1930s onward due to overfishing and eutrophication of the only lake in which it is found. Today it is listed as Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and may be on the verge of extinction. Taxonomy The Ammersee kilch was first described in 1909 by German fishery scientist Bruno Hofer in his work Die S√ºsswasserfische von Mittel-Europa. Hofer thought it a subspecies of the Lake Constance whitefish, now extinct, so he named it Coregonus acronius bavarica. Coregonus acronius was the scientific name of the Lake Constance whitefish at the time. The Ammersee kilch was reclassified as its own species in 1997 by Swiss ichthyologist Maurice Kottelat in his piece \\"European freshwater fishes: an heuristic checklist of the freshwater fishes of Europe\\" in volume 52 of the journal Biologia. Description The Ammersee kilch is a small fish with a slender, elongated body, blunted snout, large eyes, and subterminal mouth. The body is primarily silver in color, though the scales darken considerably dorsally and ventrally. It can reach sizes of up to and mature females weigh between . It can have anywhere from 18-28 gillrakers, but typically within the range of 21-24. The pectoral fins are short when folded. Distribution and habitat Lake Ammersee in the winter. The Ammersee kilch has an extremely narrow distribution: it is endemic to Lake Ammersee in Germany, which covers only 41 square kilometres (16 sq mi), however the deep water in which the fish lives probably only makes up 10 square kilometres (4 sq mi). Its depth range is for most of the year, but shallower in the summer months, typically between in depth. Spawning, which takes place in June and July, occurs deep on the lake bottom. Notably, Lake Ammersee is a mesotrophic lake, in which the water is typically clear and has medium nutrient density. Human activity and pollution during the 20th century led to eutrophication of the lake, a process in which bacterial and algal levels increase in a body of water. Eutrophication can cause fish to suffocate by lowering the oxygen levels in the water, and the IUCN mentions this as the primary threat to the survival of the Ammersee kilch species. Biology and ecology Because of its rarity, little is known about the biology of the Ammersee kilch. Spawning occurs at the lake floor, in depth, in the summer, typically between June 15 and July 15. Human interaction In the early 1900s, the Ammersee kilch was an important commercial species, but by the 1930s local fishermen considered it to be very rare. Pressure from commercial fishing combined with eutrophication starting in the 1950s led to steep population declines. Although the water quality of Lake Ammer increased in the 1970s due to drainage of local wastewater from the lake basin, the Ammersee kilch population never recovered. Today, the Ammersee kilch is listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN, and only three individuals have been caught since 2000. Preserved specimens of the Ammersee kilch are also extremely rare. A 2005 study done to redescribe the species was only able to locate three specimens: two that were caught in 1951 and a third caught after a two-year search from 2002-2004.

Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, September 2004. Frank Hartlet, Sir Harry Jephcott. Nature, Volume 274, Issue 5672, pp. 727‚Äì728 (1978).  Education  Harry Jephcott was educated at King Edward VI Camp Hill, a grammar school in Birmingham. In 1907, he was apprenticed to a pharmacist in Redditch. He joined Customs and Excise in 1912 and was seconded to the department of the government chemist in 1914. Meanwhile, he studied part-time at West Ham Technical Institute and in 1915 graduated with a first class Bachelor of Science in chemistry at the University of London. He gained the diploma of pharmaceutical chemist in 1916, took a Master's degree in 1918 with a thesis on tobacco. He was elected to be a Fellow of the Royal Institute of Chemistry in 1920.  Career  In 1919, Jephcott was recruited by Alec Nathan to the family business, Joseph Nathan & Co., which sold dried milk powder imported from New Zealand, under the trade name of Glaxo. Jephcott worked on quality control. In 1923 visited the US to meet other scientists. He obtained a licence to fortify Glaxo powder with antirachitic vitamin D, using Theodore Zucker's process for the extraction of the vitamin from fish-liver oil. In 1924, he instigated Glaxo to start production of its first pharmaceutical product, Ostelin. This was the earliest commercially-made vitamin concentrate in Great Britain. Jephcott was cognitive of new scientific ideas, had an interest in pharmaceutical sales, and was a good business strategist who understood company administration as well. His understanding of patent law with respect to pharmaceuticals led him to study for the bar and to be called to the Middle Temple in 1925. He was promoted to be general manager of the Glaxo department in 1925, a director of Joseph Nathan in 1929, managing director of the newly formed Glaxo Laboratories (GL) in 1935, and of the parent company in 1939. During World War II, Jephcott was adviser on manufactured foods to the Ministry of Food (1941‚Äì43) and chairman of the Therapeutic Research Corporation in 1943. He visited the US on behalf of the Ministry of Supply in 1944 to report on penicillin production, which helped enable Glaxo Laboratories to build factories for penicillin production by deep fermentation under licence from two American companies, Merck & Co. and Squibb. This established his company as a major force in the British pharmaceutical industry. By 1995, it became the largest pharmaceutical group in the world. Harry Jephcott organised the public flotation of Glaxo Laboratories in 1947. He retired as managing director in 1956. However, as non-executive chairman was largely responsible when his company took control of other pharmaceutical businesses, for example Allen & Hanburys in 1958. From 1963, he was appointed honorary life president.  Positions and honours  Jephcott was a member of the UK government's Advisory Council on Scientific Policy (1953‚Äì56) and Chairman of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (1956‚Äì61). He was a director of the Metal Box Company (1950‚Äì64). He was Chairman and then President of the Association of British Chemical Manufacturers (1947‚Äì55), President of the Royal Institute of Chemistry (1953‚Äì55), and a governor of the London School of Economics (1952‚Äì68). Jephcott was knighted in 1946 and created a Baronet in 1962.  Personal life  Harry Jephcott was born at Tardebigge, near Redditch, Worcestershire, England. He was the youngest of five children (three of them sons). His father was John Josiah Jephcott (1853‚Äì1929), train driver and former miner. His mother was Helen (1849‚Äì1930), daughter of Charles Matthews. Jephcott married his wife Doris (1893‚Äì1985), daughter of Henry Gregory, a builder, on 19 April 1919. She was a pharmaceutical chemist before her marriage. They had two sons. Jephcott lived from 1928 until his death in Pinner, Middlesex. He also bought farms at East Portlemouth in Devon.

Infanterie-Division) was a formation of the German Wehrmacht during World War II. It was formed 1 October 1934 in Munich from the Artillerief√ºhrer VII staff and renamed 7. Infanterie-Division with the disclosure of German rearmament on 15 October 1935. In preparation of the Invasion of Poland, the division was transferred to Slovak Republik on 1 August 1939. The division surrendered to Soviet forces near Stutthof after the unconditional surrender of 8 May 1945. Translated from Wikipedia in German (Not totally objective): The 7th infantry division was sent to Slowakia on August 1, 1939, where it was mobilized on August 26. From September 1, 1939, the division took part in the Polish campaign. After advancing to the Jablunka pass and the Zwardo≈Ñ saddle, it pursued Polish troops over the Dunajec and participated in the taking of Przemy≈õl. Upon conclusion of the Polish campaign, the 7th infantry division was transferred to the western border of the German Reich. From there it took part in the Western campaign and on May 10, 1940, attacked through L√∂wen and Tournai in the Schelde sector, where it participated in the battle on the Schelde. Afterwards, the 7th infantry division crossed the Lys and took part in the fighting around Lille. Following the truce in June, the division remained stationed in northern France as an occupation troop. In April, 1941, the 7th infantry division was transferred to the Generalgouvernement (Poland) to get ready for Operation Barbarossa. The division took part in the surprise attack on the Soviet Union from June 22, 1941, advancing past Bialystok to Minsk, then to Mogilev and Roslavl. The 7th infantry division took part in the battle of encirclement and annihilation at Smolensk, advanced over the Nara and participated in the battle of Moscow, during which the German offensive came to a halt about 60 kilometers west of Moscow due to the contrary weather conditions. Following the start of the Soviet counter-offensive on December 5, 1941, the division fought in the Shelkovka-Dorokhovo sector. Early in 1942 the withdrawal to the Nara and the Gshatsk position occurred. In 1943, the 7th infantry division fought in the Orel salient and retreated over the Desna and the Dnieper to Gomel. Later, in early 1944 there was the retreat past the Pripyat swamps through Pinsk and Bielsk to the Bug, with the division fighting between the Bug and the Narew in the following weeks and months. Afterwards, in 1945, following combat at W≈Çodawa-Wƒôgr√≥w and Castenburg [?] between the Narew and the lower Vistula, it had to retreat, still fighting, past Ciechan√≥w, Toru≈Ñ, and GrudziƒÖdz to Gdansk. After the last defensive combat around the Vistula bridgehead, the division capitulated in the Sztutowo-Stegna sector.

The work shows two women dressed in white, one sitting on a sofa and the other resting on the floor. The model on the sofa is Joanna Heffernan, the artist's mistress. By calling the painting Symphony in White, No. 3, Whistler intended to emphasise his artistic philosophy of corresponding arts, inspired by the poet Charles Baudelaire. The presence of a fan on the floor shows the influence of Japonisme, which was a popular artistic trend in European art at the time. Whistler was also greatly influenced by his colleague and friend Albert Joseph Moore, and their works show considerable similarities. Though Whistler started on the painting in 1865, he was not ready to exhibit it publicly until 1867, when it went on display at the Royal Academy. His colleagues were impressed by the painting, but not all critics fully understood the connection between the painting and its title. One review in particular questioned the presence of other colours in addition to white, a criticism which prompted Whistler to respond with a scathing and sarcastic letter. Years later, Whistler's former student Walter Sickert criticized the painting as \\"the low-water mark of the old manner, before the birth of the new.\\" Background James Abbott McNeill Whistler was born in the United States in 1834, the son of George Washington Whistler, a railway engineer.Anderson & Koval (1994), pp. 3-6. In 1843, his father relocated the family to Saint Petersburg, Russia, where James received training in painting.Weintraub (1974), pp. 6-9. After a stay in England, he returned to America to attend the US Military Academy at West Point in 1851.Anderson & Koval (1994), pp. 26-31. In 1855, he made his way back to Europe, determined to dedicate himself to painting. Here he settled in Paris at first, but in 1859 moved to London, where he would spend most of the remainder of his life.MacDonald (1999). There he met Dante Gabriel Rossetti and other members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, who would have a profound influence on Whistler.Spencer (2004) It was also in London that Whistler met Joanna Heffernan, the model who would become his lover. By 1865, Whistler had already used her as a model for other paintings, among these Symphony in White, No. 1 and Symphony in White, No. 2. Heffernan supposedly had a strong influence over Whistler; his brother-in-law Francis Seymour Haden refused a dinner invitation in the winter of 1863-64 due to her dominant presence in the household.Spencer (1998), p. 309. In January 1864, Whistler's mother Annalater depicted in the painting Arrangement in Grey and Blackarrived to stay with her son in London. As a result, Heffernan had to move out of the apartment, and only visited as a model.Anderson & Koval (1994), pp. 41-3. Still, Heffernan's presence displeased Whistler's mother, and his relationship with both women became strained.Weintraub (1974), pp. 89-90. Creation and reception Whistler started on Symphony in White, No. 3 perhaps as early as July 1865.Anderson & Koval (1994), pp. 152. It was the last of his paintings for which Heffernan was a model. He used Milly Jones, the wife of an actor friend, as the second model for the painting.Anderson & Koval (1994), pp. 151. By the middle of August, he had a complete sketch ready, and he continued work on the painting into September. Whistler kept reworking it, however, and it was not until 1867 that he considered it finished. He painted over the final \\"5\\" in the date, and replaced it with a \\"7\\", to mark the changes it had undergone.Weintraub (1974), p. 128. In March 1867, William Michael Rossetti wrote of seeing the painting in Whistler's studio, and mentioned that it was previously called The Two Little White Girls. It then went on display at the Royal Academy.Anderson & Koval (1994), pp. 166. The work was greatly admired by Whistler's colleagues, including Henri Fantin-Latour, Alfred Stevens, James Tissot and Edgar Degas. For Degas, the painting served as an inspiration for his own portrait of Eug√©nie Fiocre in the ballet La Source.Reff (1977), p. 13. Some critics, however, were confused by the title. Philip Hamerton, writing for the Saturday Review on 1 June 1867, remarked: Whistler was always belligerent in his response to critics. He wrote a letter to the editor that the newspaper would not print, but was later reprinted by Whistler himself in his book The Gentle Art of Making Enemies: The painting was originally bought by the wealthy art collector Louis Huth, who later also commissioned Whistler to paint a portrait of his wife.Anderson & Koval (1994), pp. 183. It is in the ownership of the Barber Institute of Fine Arts, in Birmingham, England. Composition and interpretation Symphony in White, No. 3 shows Heffernan reclining on a sofa with her head rested on her hand, while Jones is seated on the floor, leaning against the sofa. There is a fan on the floor, and a plant bearing white flowers on the right. The fan is an oriental element, and an expression of the artistic trend known as Japonisme which was then prevalent in European art. At the time, Whistler was greatly influenced by his friend and colleague Albert Joseph Moore. The painting bears close resemblances to Moore's roughly contemporary painting A Musician, though at the time the two were working so closely together that it is hard to ascertain exactly who influenced whom. The painter Walter Sickerta student of Whistlerlater described the painting in unflattering terms. In December 1908, five years after Whistler's death, he wrote in the Fortnightly Review: To Whistler himself, however, the painting was not old-fashioned, but rather an expression of something new and innovative. By naming it Symphony in White, No. 3, Whistler highlighted his emphasis on composition, rather than subject matter. The use of a musical title was also an expression of the theory of corresponding arts, which was an idea developed by the French poet Charles Baudelaire. These tendencies became more and more dominant in Whistler's art over time. His two earlier paintings Symphony in White, No. 1 and Symphony in White, No. 2 had originally been titled The White Girl and The Little White Girl respectively, and later been renamed by the artist.Craven (2003), p. 342-3. Whistler had originally intended to call this work Two Little White Girls, but the development of his artistic philosophy made him change his mind, and from the time of its first exhibition it has been called by its musical title.Weintraub (1974), p. 127.Taylor (1978), p. 32.

The Pakistan Army set up a military camp at Kamalpur (now in Baksiganj Upazila of Jamalpur District) which was attacked by 1st East Bengal Regiment of Z Force several times. The first attack was made on June 12, and a second attack was made on July 31, 1971. Finally, on December 4, Pakistan Army had to withdraw and fell back to their headquarters at Jamalpur after an attack by the Bangladesh Forces and Indian Army. In the aftermath of the battle, Pakistani troops were defeated and Jamalpur became free. The Camp at Kamalpur Kamalpur, a border area, was known as the gateway to Dhaka from the northern sector under Sector 11, the central sector and the largest one of Bangladesh Forces. It was situated on the mouth of the old Brahmaputra and on the road link with Mymensingh via Jamalpur.A document on Bangladesh Liberation War published in December 1999. Pakistan Army set up a military camp at Kamalpur. This camp was tactically crucial for the Pakistan Army because its fall would cause the Pakistan Army to lose control over the whole Jamalpur-Dhaka region. The Pakistani troops made concrete bunkers which contained shell proof roofs. To provide communication between bunkers, they dug communication trenches. The camp perimeter included Booby traps and minefields as defense. About two companies of 31 regiment excluding razakars constituted the enemy force. Attacks on Kamalpur Camp On June 12, 1971, the first attack was launched by Z-forces at Kamalpur Camp. Pakistani troops tried to enter the villages of Sarishabari Upazila of Jamalpur district but failed as the villagers confronted them. Many people in the villages were killed. While retreating, the Pakistan Army set fire in the villages. Under the command of Commanding Officer Major Moinul Hussain Chowdhury, the second attack was launched on July 31 (at night on August 1), 1971. The attack was made with two companies Delta and Bravo from the North ‚Äì East of the enemy camp. Captain Salahuddin Momtaz commanded Delta on the left and Captain Hafiz commanded Bravo on the right. As the troops were moving towards the enemy post, the enemy artillery started firing heavily. As a result, the progress of the two companies became slow and encountered demise. The troops continued moving forward and entered the outer perimeter of the enemy camp. Though casualties were increasing, the freedom fighters made progress through the minefield. At one stage of the fight, two shells dropped in front of Captain Salahuddin Momtaz and killed him. In the morning at 7:30, Major Moin, the battalion commander of 1st East Bengal Regiment ordered the battalion to retreat.

It is a mid-19th century building in the Greek Revival architectural style. Founded as a private school for teacher training, it eventually became a public school. It continued to be used in that capacity until 1970. Three years later it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is currently used as an arts center. Building The building is located just northeast of Spencertown, the small center of the Town of Austerlitz, along the north side of Route 203. It is on a slight rise above road level, surrounded by woods on two of its three sides. It is two stories tall, three bays wide by five deep, on a stone foundation with a gabled roof pierced by a belfry at the south end and a brick chimney at the north. It is sided in clapboard on the sides and rear and flushboard on the front. There is a fire escape on the rear. The south (front) elevation has a pedimented portico with four fluted columns topped with Ionic capitals. A single rectangular window is located in the entablature. The pilasters at the corners of the walls are done as imitation antae, and the front entrance has a classically styled architrave. Pilasters also frame the louvered vents on the hip roofed belfry. Inside, the first floor has two rooms. Upstairs is a library and auditorium. History The academy was incorporated by an act of the state legislature in 1845, after extended lobbying by the Rev. Timothy Woodbridge, pastor of the nearby St. Peter's Presbyterian Church, for a school to train teachers for the region. The land was purchased for $224 ($ in contemporary dollars). Local builder Benjamin Ambler did the construction for $2,459 ($ in contemporary dollars). It was opened and dedicated in October 1847. In 1863 some small repairs were done. Ten years later, it became a public school. Four decades later, in the 1910s and '20s, the only major physical changes were made to the building. The front porch was resurfaced in concrete in 1915, and the first story divided a decade later when modern heating and plumbing were added. The newly formed Chatham Central School District took over control of the academy in 1955. It discontinued use of the building 15 years later. Two years later, local citizens formed the Spencertown Academy Society to save the building. It was originally intended to be reused as a community center, but since then has become the Spencertown Academy Arts Center, with galleries and studios and an auditorium for local visual and performing arts.

By July 2011 the film had screened at multiple film festivals and received positive response. Reception DVD Verdict gave a mostly positive review for Anderson's Cross, stating that while it \\" won't prove terribly memorable\\" it was overall a \\"small, sweet movie with a good attitude and a lot of heart\\",as \\"a solid film; not a great one, but a solid debut.\\" While offering \\"standard late teen fodder\\", the film includes actors whose abilities \\"raise the film above your average indie drama.\\" While Jerome Elston Scott, Nicholas Downs, and Heather Bergdahl have chemistry as a threesome, it was the \\"supporting cast gives the film its life.\\" Special note is made of the work of Michael Warren, Joanna Cassidy, and Bill Moseley. While the film itself is \\"fairly forgettable\\", the \\"performances are downright excellent\\" and the film can be recommended. The reviewer concluded, \\"Anderson's Cross is a small, sweet movie with a good attitude and a lot of heart. It won't prove terribly memorable, but it's a fine first feature.\\" Moving Pictures Magazine wrote that the film \\"has its heart in the right place\\", offering earnest intentions and having an undeniable sweetness, but \\"unfortunately, it plays like a castrated teen Desperate Housewives.\\" With the film focusing on the relationships of middle-class teens and their families, it had elements reminiscent of Knots Landing or Peyton Place in \\"its spotlight on alcoholism, absentee fathers, statutory rape, homosexuality and death\\", but presented in a sanitized version which diminished dramatic potential. The reviewer noted that director Scott had written the lead role of Nick Anderson with thought toward playing that role himself but was too old by the time of filming, which resulted in the role being miscast and becoming the film's greatest problem. As played by Michael Warren, the character of Nick was not compelling, being \\"just too dopey, too hangdog, too hopelessly bland\\" and lacking in magnetism and charisma for the other characters, as shared in the film, to have such romantic interest in him. It was offered that despite its flaws \\"the script has nuggets of genuineness, and Micah Stuart as Trevor, the paperboy who romances Nick, is natural and dimensional\\", but the film's quality moments were \\"not enough to cut through the sentimental facileness and surface melodrama of an ensemble of characters many of whose names we can‚Äôt even remember.\\" Recognition=Awards and nominations * 2007, won 'Best International Feature' at the Bridgetown Film Festival in Barbados * 2007, won FADE IN Award for 'Best Feature Film' at the Independent Black Film Festival in Atlanta, Future plans In November 2010, Jerome Elston Scott revealed that Illumination Pictures was developing a prequel television series based on Anderson's Cross for cable television, aimed at a younger demographic to depict the growing relationships of the original film's main characters. In a press release, Illumination Pictures announced that the series would center around the Anderson family and the teen friends as adolescents. Negotiations have begun with original cast members Michael Warren, Joanna Cassidy, and Joyce Guy to reprise their roles as the parents. Due to the prequel series taking place in an earlier timeline than the original, the roles of the teens will be cast with younger actors. Screenwriter Jerome E.

The series debuted on MTV on January 18, 2010. The first-season finale aired on March 8, 2010. Filming for the second season began early 2010 in New York City, mostly at Pratt Institute, the college which series star Liz Lee attends. Season two premiered February 8, 2011, and consisted of 12 episodes. The series was not renewed for a third season, and the series finale aired on May 3, 2011. Genre My Life as Liz uses the camera-work and editing typical of reality television. The show hints at Liz living in a small country-like town where her individuality is constantly threatened. The Texas city Liz lives in is a rapidly growing city of over 35,000 residents. The show targets isolated scenes repeatedly to hide this truth and leaves something to be desired in the lack of diversity. The Los Angeles Times asserts that the show \\"is quasi-reality‚Äîreal people, in their real environment, leading lives that are being in some way dramatized\\" and that the show \\"flirts with documentary but intersperses scenes of high-school hallway conversations\\". An MTV executive has stated, \\"We don't look at it as just a reality show. We weren't going to call it a sitcom, because it's not.\\" Executive Producer Marshall Eisen stated, \\"The rule was, when Liz is around other people, we played that as straight as we could. When she's alone, that's when we were able to stylize things more.\\" Liz herself has confirmed that there are multiple scenes that are \\"planned\\", citing the scene in \\"Liz's Got Talent (Part 1)\\", where Liz dresses as a superhero, and in \\"Summer of Suck\\", where Taylor Terry is shown in front of a black screen, but the events and relationships are true. The series frequently uses music from Faded Paper Figures, both for its end credits and during various episodes. Series overview Season one focused on the life of Liz Lee. She lives in Burleson, Texas, a conservative, religious suburb in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area; she is extremely proud to be a geek and is happy to have her friends. The show also focuses on Liz's main antagonist, Cori Cooper and her minions Taylor Terry and Tori Langley, and all of Liz's friends, such as Bryson Gilreath (who is also her love interest), Colin \\"Sully\\" Sullivan, Miles Reed, and Troy Yingst. Season one shows Liz's journey through her senior year in high school, and her struggles with her enemy Cori Cooper. Season two is set in New York, with Liz adjusting to old and new friends. Cast Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Lee: The show's main character, is a girl from Burleson, Texas. She is a self- proclaimed individualist and geek. She feels that in her town people are either stuck-up or narrow-minded. She admits she used to be a typical \\"preppy girl\\", until Cori Cooper betrayed her in high school. She enjoys reading comic books and is obsessed with Star Wars. Season one covers how she deals with high-school drama, sometimes with Cori involved. In \\"My Secret Valentine\\", she begins to develop a crush on her friend, Bryson, even though he has a girlfriend at the time. Their friendship gradually gets stronger as he gives Liz support during her high school talent show, even playing guitar alongside Liz to make her less nervous when performing. Despite their friendship, Bryson rejects her offer to go to the prom and makes Liz want to forget. In the season one finale, however, Bryson finally confesses his feelings to Liz. After high school, she moves to New York to attend Pratt Institute. However, she meets very few people and has troubling juggling her long-distance relationship with Bryson. It is in New York where she meets Louis, a possible boyfriend after Bryson is dishonest with her in \\"The Morning After\\". Colin \\"Sully\\" Sullivan: Liz's sidekick and best friend. He takes pride in his comic book collection and is always there for Liz. He is a huge supporter for her, especially when she auditions for her school talent show by making T-shirts in support for Liz. It's revealed in \\"The ABC's of Friendship\\" that he secretly likes Liz but will not take the chance of asking her out; he fears it might jeopardize their great friendship. During high school prom, Liz invites Sully to come with him after being rejected by her love interest, Bryson. In \\"A Prom to Remember (Part 2)\\", Sully shows that he wants to get Liz and Bryson together by distracting Bryson's date in order for them to have alone time. In season two, Sully remains loyal to Liz and her relationship with Bryson. He gets extremely protective of Liz when he meets Louis for the first time in \\"The New Morning\\". During his visit in New York, he meets a girl named Marlene, who shares his love of comics and inevitably develops a crush on her. In the season two finale, Sully returns to New York finally admits his love for Liz in order for him to move on towards Marlene. However, Sully fails when Marlene \\"pulls the friend card.\\" Bryson Gilreath: Liz's crush during season one; however, he has a girlfriend. They almost kiss at the end of season one, but their friends awkwardly cheer before the kiss. In season two, Bryson surprises Liz in New York and they finally kiss, however, Liz finds out that Bryson supposedly has a girlfriend back home in Austin. He is supposed to love her but it seems like he does since he leaves school for the weekend and spends it with her. Afterward, Bryson desperately tries to contact her, but Liz continues to ignore him. Once he finds out that she is dating Louis, he gets jealous, and due to Sully exposing his feelings about Liz, he admits to Liz that he does in fact love her in the season two finale. Taylor Terri: A past sidekick for Cori Cooper, Liz's antagonist. At first, Liz doesn't trust her because of Taylor befriending Liz in the summer but ignoring her while in school. However, throughout Liz's senior year at Burleson High, she and Taylor slowly become good friends; for example, when she stands up for Liz against Cori Cooper at her ABC party. While helping Liz to be with Bryson, Taylor also befriends Sully and the rest of the gang, and is seen during season two frequently hanging out with the group while Liz is in New York. In season two, it was revealed that Taylor has decided to go to college in New York as well. Cori Cooper (season 1, guest season 2): Known as the \\"Queen of Mean\\", Cori is very self-absorbed and hates \\"anyone who has an original thought\\". She is the most popular girl in school, because she's the prettiest. She is also a member of the \\"blonde squad\\", which consists of her, Taylor, and Tori. She will do whatever it takes to get what she wants, and no one can stand in her way. She always looks for ways to get back at Liz, her nemesis. Cori does suffer a few personal defeats in the series, such as when she verbally attacks Liz at a party being given by Taylor, who stood up for her against Cori's insults. Cori then demands that she choose between her and Liz. Taylor, finally having had enough of Cori's hateful behavior, chooses Liz. Later in the season during the \\"A Prom to Remember (Part 2)\\" episode, Liz had a mini-meltdown right before the school announced the prom queen, which was awarded to someone else. Cori then had a meltdown and went to the bathroom with her other friend, crying about how she feels and how she thinks everyone in the school hates her, and now realizes that her shallow, stuck-up, and vindictive ways have finally led to her downfall. It was revealed in season two that she had a baby. Louis M Johnson (season 2): An aspiring musician in a two-man band, Louis meets Liz in the season two premiere while she was dumpster diving for art project materials. At first, she considered him a sign of moving on from Bryson, until Bryson visits her in New York. After learning of Bryson's girlfriend in Texas, Louis is the one who cheers her up. He continues to flirt with Liz while she searches for an apartment and even lets her move in with him temporarily. When Louis finally gets the chance to go out with her, he ends up meeting Sully and the gang, who are skeptical of him at first and make it their priority to make sure he won't hurt Liz. Liz actually offers to sing with Louis at a 1980s gig, where they share their first kiss after their performance. In the season two finale, Liz and Louis decide to put their relationship on hold while he goes on tour with his band Augustine.

Club gave the first episode of season one a C rating. She compared the show to the style of the Coen Brothers films and of mockumentary of Christopher Guest, but criticized it for having learned all the wrong lessons. She credited the show with having some goofy charm but was disappointed by the same old stereotypes. She questioned if the show is a sitcom blended with a reality show or the other way around. She criticized the heavily-scripted nature of the show, but noted the show could be fixed if it was more honest and decisive about what it really wants to be. Rating C Mike Hale of The New York Times gave a somewhat similar opinion, saying, \\"it registers more as a sitcom than a reality show ‚Äî it's so stylized and carefully planned and post-produced, it's the next best thing to scripted, if it isn‚Äôt in fact a wholly scripted put-on,\\" but remarks, \\"and that's the point.\\" He says of the premise that \\"it's as if the geeky misfit viewer who hates all those blonde women on The Hills were suddenly part of the show.\\" Although he says the main protagonist \\"doesn‚Äôt make her life or her opinions seem interesting enough to draw you in,\\" he finds some of the other characters make more of an impression.

Seed investors SV Angel and Maveron also participated.http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2014/11/12/course-hero- raises-15m-for-crowd-sourced-study.html In February 2020, the company raised a further $10 million in Series B Funding, valuing the company at over $1 billion. The Series B round was led by NewView Capital, whose founder and managing partner, Ravi Viswanathan, joined Course Hero‚Äôs board of directors. NewView Capital also contributed $30 million in what‚Äôs known as an employee tender offer, a process by which NewView purchased company shares directly from Course Hero employees.https://www.edsurge.com/news/2020-02-12-course- hero-joins-the-edtech-unicorn-stable  Features =Study Documents In 2012 it was asserted that Course Hero provided access to over 7 million uploaded study documents.

This includes exams and their keys, quizzes and their keys, study guides written by instructors. To protect the rights of the copyright holders, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act requires Course Hero to expeditiously remove content when it is flagged as infringing its copyright.

Privacy concerns Course Hero pages contain names, emails, addresses, and/or office locations of faculty and teaching assistants, with no indication that Course Hero was authorized to post/sell that information. Cheating As Course Hero allows students to post previous homework and exam solutions from their classes, the website is often cited as an aid to student cheating.

He is a member of the People's Democratic Party (PDP). He was reelected on 26 April 2011. Chime has five children: Ada Chime, Nnamdi Chime, Tochukwu Chime, Ezinne Chime, Ugomsi Chime. He married his second wife Clara Chime in 2008. Background Sullivan Iheanacho Chime was born on 10 April 1959 at Park Lane Hospital, GRA, Enugu, Enugu State. He attended the College of Immaculate Conception (CIC) in Enugu for his secondary education (1971 - 1976). He studied Law at the University of Nigeria, Enugu Campus, graduating in 1980. He then enrolled at the Nigerian Law School, Lagos and graduated on 10 July 1981, when he was called to the bar. For the next seventeen years he ran a private legal practice in Enugu. He was Secretary of Nigeria Bar Association, Enugu branch (1992 - 1994). Later, he was appointed Special Adviser (Legal Matters) to the Governor of Enugu State, Dr. Chimaroke Nnamani. In 2001, he was appointed Attorney General and Commissioner of Justice of Enugu State. Governor of Enugu State In April 2007, Sullivan Chime successfully vied for the post of governor of Enugu State on the People's Democratic Party (PDP) platform. He was sworn into office on 29 May 2007, succeeding Dr. Chimaroke Nnamani. He was reelected on 26 April 2011. Chime favoured a 4-point agenda for development: Physical Infrastructure, Economic Expansion and Employment, Rural Development and Service Delivery. In spite of his achievements, Chime was known to shun public functions, rather preferring to send a delegate than appear in person, even more so he shunned public fora that were inclined to celebrate his achievements. His political reticence earned him the title 'Silent Achiever' *Physical Infrastructure: Chime started very well as governor, reconstructing roads in Enugu urban areas, and key roads in the rural areas. The roads were of good quality and durable, complete with street lights, drainage and pedestrian sidewalks. Chime also advocated compliance with traffic laws, introduced traffic lights, solved traffic issues by dualizing roads, or creating new routes altogether. Under his administration, pipe-borne water supply as well as electricity improved. But a few of Chime's actions have not been without controversy such as the recent demolition of the State Secretariat built during the colonial era. Some believe the demolition was needless, and more so the funds required to build the new Secretariat could have been invested in other key areas. Others point out that a new State Secretariat is appropriate given the State's growing workforce. *Security: Chime also invested in statewide security. In the second quarter of 2013, he donated 100 units each of Kia Rio and Hilux vans equipped with communication gadgets to the Enugu State Police Command for urban and rural policing respectively (despite this being a Federal Government concern). Enugu State was, under his administration, declared to have the least crime rate, and one of the safest places in Nigeria.[3] . *Health: Chime introduced free maternal and child healthcare in State-owned hospitals in response to the high maternal mortality ratio of 286 per 100,000 women and the Under-5 mortality of 103 per 1000 children in the South East[3]Chime was out of the state for an extended period of time. Following reports that he was dead in an Indian hospital on 15 December 2012, an Enugu State government official debunked the reports the next day, claiming Chime was healthy and that any such rumours were from the pits of hell. [4]It is the fervent hope of the natives of Enugu State that Chime would undertake massive reforms in the health sector such as building world-class medical facilities so as to make foreign medical trips unnecessary. *Education: Education has yet to get due attention under Chime, despite Chime crusading for a return of schools to the missions. Some schools have recorded successes in this regard such as College of the Immaculate Conception, Chime's own Alma Mater and several other schools in Enugu Urban. But in several other communities, pupils still lack basic infrastructure and teachers. Even the State-owned Institute of Management and Technology plays host to dingy buildings, aging due to bad maintenance.

Development and design In October 1937, the Belgian aircraft manufacturer Soci√©t√© Anonyme Belge de Constructions A√©ronautiques (SABCA) made a marketing agreement with the Italian company Caproni, with SABCA selling some of Caproni's military aircraft in certain markets, including the Caproni Ca.135, Ca.310 and the Ca.312, which were to be designated SABCA S.45bis, S.46 and S.48 respectively. As part of this agreement, Caproni were to develop a replacement for the Belgium Air Force's Fairey Fox biplanes, which were used as two-seat fighters and reconnaissance aircraft, but were obsolete.Green 1967, p.38.

It was a low-winged cantilever monoplane of mixed construction, with a metal skinned steel-tube fuselage and wood and fabric wings, powered by a single Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs V12 engine. It had a hydraulically actuated retractable tailwheel undercarriage, with the mainwheels retracting backwards into the wing. The pilot and observer were provided with individual, widely separated cockpits, with the observer having defensive armament of a single machine gun, and the pilot firing a Hispano-Suiza HS.404 moteur-canon firing through the propeller hub and two wing mounted machine guns, a small bomb bay housing two 50 kg (110 lb) bombs, while a further ten 50 kg (22 lb) bombs could be carried under the wings.Green 1967, pp. 38‚Äì39. The Ca.335 prototype was built at Caproni's Ponte San Pietro factory, making its maiden flight there on 16 February 1939. It was then dismantled and sent to SABCA's factory at Brussels by train. After reassembly, it flew again on 19 September 1939. Initial testing was successful, resulting in SABCA purchasing a license for manufacture of the Ca.335, and demonstrating it, now designated SABCA S.47, to officials of the Belgian Ministry of Defence and representatives of a number of other nations. While the Belgian Air Force were impressed by the S.47, and had a requirement for 24 of them, SABCA's factory was busy with orders for 41 Breguet 693s for the Belgian Air Force and for France, and 10 Koolhoven F.K.58s for France, delaying a formal order being placed.Green 1967, pp. 39‚Äì40. On 14 March 1940, the prototype was being demonstrated to the French Armee de l'Air at Orl√©ans when it was damaged in a minor landing accident. It had not been repaired when the Germans invaded France and the Low Countries, stopping SABCA's production plans. The prototype S.47 was captured by the advancing German forces on 13 June 1940. Attempts by Caproni to reclaim the S.47 were unsuccessful, it remaining in France until 1943, eventually being scrapped.Green 1967, p.39.

Although it received authorisation for its construction, only a short section of it was ever built. This section is open today as part of the Kent and East Sussex Railway. History With the opening of the South Eastern Main Line between and Ashford in 1842; the railway between Ashford and Hastings in 1851, and the railway between Tonbridge and Hastings in stages between 1845 and 1853, a large tract of the High Weald in Kent and East Sussex was left devoid of railways. In 1892, the Hawkhurst Branch Line was opened to . It was extended to the following year. The South Eastern Railway (SER) planned a line to link Cranbrook, Tenterden and Ashford. These plans were abandoned by the SER but were taken up by the Rother Valley Railway (RVR) in November 1898 and promoted as the Cranbrook, Tenterden & Ashford Light Railway. The SER opposed the section of line from Tenterden to Ashford and this was dropped by the RVR. Construction of the Cranbrook & Tenterden Light Railway was authorised in December 1899. In 1900, the RVR opened as far as a station at , which was then known as Tenterden. The only part of the Cranbrook and Tenterden Light Railway ever built was the section between the original Tenterden station and Tenterden Town. This opened to traffic on 15 April 1903. On 4 January 1954, this section of line closed to passengers along with the rest of the K&ESR.; It remained open for freight until 12 June 1961 when the remaining section of the K&ESR; closed, apart from a short section at Robertsbridge.

The Cranbrook and Tenterden Light Railway would have commenced from a junction just to the north of Cranbrook station, heading in a generally north easterly direction to Cranbrook Town station, and then turning south easterly to serve Sissinghurst Road station and Benenden station, after which the line turned east to serve Rolvenden station and joining the Rother Valley Railway via a triangular junction between Tenterden and Tenterden Town stations. The line from the junction with the RVR to Tenterden Town station included a climb at 1 in 50.

Pictured are terraced vineyards in Northern Portugal's Douro Valley. In viticulture, the climates of wine regions are categorised based on the overall characteristics of the area's climate during the growing season. While variations in macroclimate are acknowledged, the climates of most wine regions are categorised (somewhat loosely based on the K√∂ppen climate classification) as being part of a Mediterranean (for example TuscanyS. Siddons \\"How the Tuscany Wine Region Works\\" TLC Cooking, Accessed: Jan 18th, 2010), maritime (ex: BordeauxM. Ewing-Mulligan \\"France's Bordeaux Wine Region\\" Dummies.com Reference page. Accessed: Jan 18th, 2010) or continental climate (ex: Columbia ValleyA. Mumma \\"The Washington wine difference: it's in the vineyard\\" Wines & Vines, November 2005). The majority of the world's premium wine production takes place in one of these three climate categories in locations between the 30th parallel and 50th parallel in both the northern and southern hemisphere.T. Stevenson \\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\\" pg 14-15 Dorling Kindersley 2005 While viticulture does exist in some tropical climates, most notably Brazil, the amount of quality wine production in those areas is so small that the climate effect has not been as extensively studied as other categories.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 179-195, 388, 428-434, 716-714 Oxford University Press 2006 Influence of climate on viticulture Large bodies of water, such as Lake Geneva in Switzerland, can have a moderating effect on the climate of a region. Beyond establishing whether or not viticulture can even be sustained in an area, the climatic influences of a particular area goes a long way in influencing the type of grape varieties grown in a region and the type of viticultural practices that will be used. The presence of adequate sun, heat and water are all vital to the healthy growth and development of grapevines during the growing season. Additionally, continuing research has shed more light on the influence of dormancy that occurs after harvest when the grapevine essentially shuts down and reserves its energy for the beginning of the next year's growing cycle. In general, grapevines thrive in temperate climates which grant the vines long, warm periods during the crucial flowering, fruit set and ripening periods.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 20-21 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 The physiological processes of a lot of grapevines begin when temperatures reach around . Below this temperature, the vines are usually in a period of dormancy. Drastically below this temperature, such as the freezing point of the vines can be damaged by frost. When the average daily temperature is between the vine will begin flowering. When temperatures rise up to many of the vine's physiological processes are in full stride as grape clusters begin to ripen on the vine. One of the characteristics that differentiates the various climate categories from one another is the occurrence and length of time that these optimal temperatures appear during the growing season.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 12-21 Workman Publishing 2001 In addition to temperature, the amount of rainfall (and the need for supplemental irrigation) is another defining characteristics. On average, a grapevine needs around of water for sustenance during the growing season, not all of which may be provided by natural rain fall. In Mediterranean and many continental climates, the climate during the growing season may be quite dry and require additional irrigation. In contrast, maritime climates often suffer the opposite extreme of having too much rainfall during the growing season which poses its own viticultural hazards. Other climate factors such as wind, humidity, atmospheric pressure, sunlight as well as diurnal temperature variations‚Äîwhich can define different climate categories‚Äîcan also have pronounced influences on the viticulture of an area. Mediterranean climates Wine regions with Mediterranean climates. Most California wine regions have a Mediterranean climate. Penfolds winery, Magill Estate in South Australia. Central Chilean wine regions experience a Mediterranean climate. Stellenbosch wines from South Africa are from grapes grown in a Mediterranean climate. Wine regions with Mediterranean climates are characterised by their long growing seasons of moderate to warm temperatures. Throughout the year there is little seasonal change, with temperatures in the winter generally warmer than those of maritime and continental climates. During the grapevine growing season, there is very little rainfall (with most precipitation occurring in the winter months) which increases the risk of the viticultural hazard of drought and may present the need for supplemental irrigation. The Mediterranean climate is most readily associated with the areas around the Mediterranean basin, where viticulture and winemaking first flourished on a large scale due to the influence of the Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans of the ancient world.

Hungary is removed from Atlantic and Mediterranean influences by distance and mountains, causing its wine regions to have a continental climate. Washington State and Oregon has a continental climate characterized by hot summers and moderately cold winters. Great Lake, it is continental in the Lake Michigan Shore AVA of SW Michigan. The Upper Mississippi River Valley AVA in the Midwestern United States has a continental climate. Xinjiang is NW China located near the centre of Asia, so its vineyards have a very continental climate. Wine regions with continental climates are characterised by the very marked seasonal changes that occur throughout the growing season, with hot temperatures during the summer season and winters cold enough for periodic ice and snow. This is generally described as having a high degree of continentality. Regions with this type of climate are often found inland on continents without a significant body of water (such as an inland sea) that can moderate their temperatures. Often during the growing season continental climates will have wide diurnal temperature variations, with very warm temperatures during the day that drop drastically at night. During the winter and early spring months, frost and hail can be viticultural hazards. Depending on the particular macroclimate of the region, irrigation may be needed to supplement seasonal rainfall. These many climatic influences contribute to the wide vintage variation that is often typical of continental climates such as Burgundy. There are more wine regions with continental climates in the northern hemisphere than there are in the southern hemisphere. This is due, in part, to small land mass size of southern hemisphere continents relative to the large oceans nearby. This difference means that the oceans exert a more direct influence on the climate of the southern hemisphere wine regions (making them maritime or possibly Mediterranean) than they would on the larger northern hemisphere continents. There are also several wine regions (such as Spain) that have areas that exhibit a continental Mediterranean climate due to their altitude or distance from the sea. These regions will have more distinct seasonal change than Mediterranean climates, but still retain some characteristics like a long growing season that is very dry during the summer.

Wine regions of New Zealand adjacent to major cities. Its climate is maritime, which provides ample weather for wine-growing areas. The Outer Lands wine regions of the Northeastern United States have a maritime climate. Puget Sound is a major inlet promoting a maritime climate in its American Viticultural Area. Port Phillip is an inland sea promoting a maritime climate in its surrounding wine regions, including the Melbourne metropolitan area. The Garden Route wine regions of South Africa have a very mild subtropical maritime climate. Wine regions with maritime climates are characterised by their close proximity to large bodies of water (such as oceans, estuaries and inland seas) that moderate their temperatures. Maritime climates share many characteristics with both Mediterranean and continental climates and are often described as a \\"middle ground\\" between the two extremes.C. Fallis, editor The Encyclopedic Atlas of Wine pg 20-21 Global Book Publishing 2006 Like Mediterranean climates, maritime climates have a long growing season, with water currents moderating the region's temperatures. However, Mediterranean climates are usually very dry during the growing season, and maritime climates are often subject to the viticultural hazards of excessive rain and humidity that may promote various grape diseases, such as mold and mildew. Like continental climates, maritime climates will have distinct seasonal changes, but they are usually not as drastic, with warm, rather than hot, summers and cool, rather than cold, winters. Maritime climates also exist in some wine- growing areas of highlands of subtropical and tropical latitudes, including the southern Appalachian Mountains in the United States, the eastern Australian highlands and the central highlands of Mexico.

In condensed matter physics, Luttinger's theorem is a result derived by J. M. Luttinger and J. C. Ward in 1960 that has broad implications in the field of electron transport. It arises frequently in theoretical models of correlated electrons, such as the high-temperature superconductors, and in photoemission, where a metal's Fermi surface can be directly observed. Definition Luttinger's theorem states that the volume enclosed by a material's Fermi surface is directly proportional to the particle density. While the theorem is an immediate result of the Pauli exclusion principle in the case of noninteracting particles, it remains true even as interactions between particles are taken into consideration provided that the appropriate definitions of Fermi surface and particle density are adopted.

Nielsen- Gammon's article identified and documented further details of the sources of the error.By the way, there will still be glaciers in the Himalayas in 2035 by John Nielsen-Gammon, Houston Chronicle, 22 December 2009 Nielsen-Gammon earned an S.B.

Biography Mary Erskine lived on a close off the High Street in Edinburgh, to the east of St Giles' Cathedral, and close to the Cowgate, then a fashionable suburb. She was born at Garlet House, Clackmannanshire, in 1629. Little is known of her early life, but in 1661 she married Robert Kennedie, a writer (i.e., a lawyer) and they had five children, three boys and two girls, all of whom appear to have died in infancy. Robert Kennedie died in 1671 leaving Mary with considerable debts, although she managed to pay these off through careful management. On 23 September 1675, Mary Erskine married her second husband, James Hair, in North Leith. James Hair was a chemist, and owned a chemist's shop on the High Street. He was considerably younger than Mary Erskine, but he too died in 1683. By the contract of marriage, Mary Erskine inherited most of what belonged to her husband. It seems that this was not a large sum of money, but she used the money to set up a private bank, and built up a considerable fortune. She died on 2 June 1707 and was buried two days later in Greyfriars Kirkyard at the end of the section known as the Covenanters' Prison.  Mary Erskine's School  In 1694, Mary Erskine, by then known as Mrs Hair, donated 10,000 merks to the Merchant Company of Edinburgh for the maintenance of daughters of burgesses in the city of Edinburgh. The money was used to establish the Merchant Maiden Hospital, a girls' school, on the Cowgate. In 1706 Mrs Hair gave a further donation with which to buy a house and garden outside the city wall at Bristo. In 1707 she donated a further 4,000 merks to the Hospital, retaining the right to appoint two members of the Erskine family as governors. The Merchant Maiden Hospital was renamed and relocated several times, but in 1944 it was named The Mary Erskine School in honour of its founding benefactor. The school stood for many years at the west end of Queen Street but was demolished for redevelopment and is now located in the Ravelston area of Edinburgh. In 1704 Mary Erskine founded the Trades Maiden Hospital with the Incorporated Trades of Edinburgh, to provide boarding and education for the daughters and granddaughters of \\"decayed\\" craftsmen and tradesmen. This was at first situated in the Horse Wynd (now West College Street) on the south side of what is now Chambers Street. In 1855 it moved to Rillbank at Sciennes. In 1892 it moved again, this time to Ashfield, 121 Grange Loan. Finally in 1971 it moved once more, to 61 Melville Street, on the corner with Manor Place, opposite the chapter house of St. Mary's Episcopal Cathedral.

This work is a rare collection of definitions, descriptions and comments on all the essential music by other ancient reputed authors from Bharata Muni to Sharangdeva. Its main feature is the treatment of Ragas; categorizing them as male, female and neuter.http://aalaap.net/sangitamakaranda.html History The treatise circa 1100 CE is the earliest text where rules similar to the current Hindustani classical music can be found. Narada actually names and classifies the system in its earlier form before the advent of changes as a result of Persian influences. It includes 19 types of Veena and 101 types of Tal. The three distinct stages It also hints on the uniqueness of the raga-nomenclaturing. On close study of it, one learns of three distinct stages on the nomenclaturing of the Indian ragas. *Stage one refers Bharata's Natyashastra (prior 2nd century BC). It is the stage of raga-nomenclature when the ragas were named after the saliant swara of the ragas. For example, after Shadaj swara, originated the name of the Raga called shadaji; after Arishabh swara originated the name of Aasharbhi Raga; and after Gandhari swara was named the Gaandhari Raga, the last one being still in currency. *In the second stage, the Ragas were named after different jana (tribes or the clans) dwelling in different geographical locations. For example, after Shaka tribe was named Shakatilak Raga or Shakamishrat variants of Shaka Raga; after Pulinda tribe was named the Pulinda Raga; after Abhira clan was named Abhiri Raga; after Savara tribe was named Saviri or Saverka. Similarly after Malava, Andhra, Gurjar, Kambhoja (Kamboja) tribes were named Ragas Malvika, Andhrri, Gurjari and Kambhoji (Kamboji) respectively, with all their variants.cf: Ragas and Raginis, pp 72-77, O. P. Ganguli; cf: Music in Education, 1955, p 80, Dmitrij Kabalevskij; Ancient Kamboja People and the Country, 1981, p 233, Dr J. L. Kamboj. *In the third stage, the ragas were named after the janapada or desha or country of their origin. For example, after Bengal was named Bangal- Raga; after Sindhudesha was named Saindhvi Raga; after Sauvira Janapada was named Sauviri or Sauvirak Raga; after Saurashtra was named the Saurashtri (or Sorathi or Surat or Surat-malar); and after Karnata janapada was named Karnati Raga etc. Similarly, the Kambhoji Raga or Ragini which is now very popular in southern India was named after the Kambhoja janapada. Scholars believe that the Kambhoji raga or ragini had probably originated in the jana rather than the janapada stage.Ancient Kamboja People and the Country, 1981, p 233, Dr J. L. Kamboj, cf: Ragas and Raginis, pp 72-77, O. P. Ganguli, The Kambojas Through the Ages, 2005, p 94, S Kirpal Singh This implies that the basic tune of raga Kamboji or Kambhoji must have evolved during epic or even pre-epic times.

About  The Carver houses replaced brownstones and tenement buildings which were demolished through slum clearance, displacing residents. During construction, crews discovered they were building over Montague's Creek, which fed into Hell Gate. The first buildings of the development were completed in 1955, and the complete development was finished on January 31, 1958. Kahn & Jacobs designed the complex which is named after George Washington Carver (1864-1943), an African American chemist, botanist, and educator who, despite being born a slave, developed many uses for soybeans, peanuts, and sweet potatoes. The playground was designed by landscape architect M. Paul Friedberg whose climbable sculpture was inspired by Isamu Noguchi. The project was funded by the state and rentals cost $12 a room. Once completed, the neighborhood saw a population decrease from over 2,000 residents to around 1,200. In December 1970, led by the Young Lords, tenants organized a rent strike until NYCHA provided more police officers to help preserve their community.

Krastev was an influential member of the modernist Misal (\\"Thought\\") circle, a leading collaboration of writers that aimed to revolutionize Bulgarian literature and introduce the modern ideas of European literature and philosophy to the country. Biography Krastyo Krastev was born in the Ottoman town of Pirot (then part of the empire's Ni≈° district in Danube Province), today in eastern Serbia. He began his education in his hometown, where he finished a Bulgarian progymnasium (junior high school). Along with a wave of Bulgarian refugees, his family had to move to the newly established Principality of Bulgaria in 1878, as Pirot was ceded to the Principality of Serbia by the Treaty of Berlin. Krastev's family settled in the capital Sofia, where he enrolled at the First Sofia High School for Boys. Owing to the high school curriculum's focus on classical languages, he studied Ancient Greek along with French, German, Russian, shorthand and other subjects. While still at high school, Krastev worked as a shorthand writer for the National Assembly of Bulgaria. Krastev finished high school in 1885 and in 1888 graduated in philosophy from the University of Leipzig in the German Empire, where he wrote a doctorate under Wilhelm Wundt, the father of experimental psychology. His doctorate discussed Hermann Lotze's metaphysical concept of the soul. Krastev was engaged in literary criticism while still in Leipzig, where he wrote a study on Ivan Vazov's poetical works. After his graduation, Krastev returned to Bulgaria to become the headmaster of the Kazanlak pedagogical school (1888‚Äì1890) and then a teacher of logic, psychology and ethics at the First Sofia High School for Boys (1890‚Äì1891). In 1892, he was employed by the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a translator. After the opening of Sofia University, Krastev was appointed as a lecturer of philosophy in 1895; he taught philosophy at the Sofia University in 1895‚Äì1896, 1899‚Äì1907, and 1908‚Äì1919. In 1899‚Äì1904, he was again a teacher at the First Sofia High School for Boys, and in 1907‚Äì1908 he was the headmaster of the Bulgarian pedagogical school in Skopje, Macedonia. Accepted by the Bulgarian Literary Society (today Bulgarian Academy of Sciences) as a correspondent member in 1898, he was made a full member in 1900. Krastev died in Sofia in 1919. Work From 1888 on, Krastev gained prominence among the Bulgarian literary society with his regular publications of critics and reviews in the press. He was the editor of a literary magazine while still in Kazanlak, and in 1891 he published the Kritika (\\"Critic\\") magazine, the first Bulgarian magazine devoted to literary criticism. He is best remembered as the editor-in-chief of the literary magazine Misal (\\"Thought\\"), the leading literary magazine in Bulgaria before World War I, and as being an inseparable part of the eponymous circle formed around it. The circle, which consisted of Krastev, Pencho Slaveykov, Peyo Yavorov and Petko Todorov, aimed to introduce modernism to the Bulgarian public and to develop an aesthetic sense in the readers. Its goal was also to introduce European influences in Bulgarian literature while retaining its unique characteristics. Misal was issued between 1892 and 1907. As a critic, Krastev contributed to a large number of Bulgarian magazines and newspapers, and had extensive studies on modern Bulgarian literature published in prominent foreign publications such as the Saint Petersburg-based Sovremennik and Vestnik Evropy and the Internationale Wochenschrift from Berlin. He was often critical towards the \\"old\\" representatives of Bulgarian literature, such as Vazov, Zahari Stoyanov, Elin Pelin, and Lyuben Karavelov, as he was more favourable towards the modern trends and \\"young\\" writers, the careers of some of which his reviews boosted. Krastev's philosophical views have been described as emphasizing subjective idealism while being nevertheless eclectic in nature. Krastev was a staunch opponent of Ludwig B√ºchner's materialism and his Bulgarian supporters, and his aesthetic views were influenced by neo- Kantianism. Krastev's work as a translator is also notable: he published Bulgarian translations of Lessing's Emilia Galotti, Henrik Ibsen's John Gabriel Borkman, When We Dead Awaken, Ghosts and An Enemy of the People and works by Descartes.

Nehemiah Hall and his wife, Sarah, had nine children (all born in Uxbridge): John (3 Oct 1751 ‚Äì 30 May 1755); Nathan (29 Aug 1753 ‚Äì 13 Mar 1835); John (30 Jun 1755 ‚Äì date ?); Baxter (10 Oct 1757 ‚Äì 4 Jul 1842); Hannah (10 Oct 1759 ‚Äì before 1768); David (2 Oct 1762 ‚Äì 25 Jul 1798); Nehemiah (7 Dec 1764 ‚Äì 29 Dec 1842); Hannah (19 Mar 1768 - ?); and Jonathan (18 Sep 1770 ‚Äì 27 Jul 1848). The Baxter Family (where Baxter Hall got his name from) were one of the founding families of Quincy, Massachusetts, with Gregory Baxter and his wife, Margaret Paddy. Their daughter, Abigail Baxter, married Joseph Adams and were President John Adams' Great Grandparents. Baxter Hall's brothers Nehemiah and David also served during the American Revolution and are also buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery in Uxbridge, MA. His father, Nehemiah Hall, Sr., was appointed of a committee on July 6, 1774, \\"to correspond with committees that now or shall be chosen by any towns in this province for the purpose on any Matur (matter) that my respect the present difficulty that now or may subsist between Great Britain and North America.\\" This committee consisted of Samuel Read, Joshua Wood, Moses Taft, Seth Read, Joseph Chapin, Moses Keith, Dexter Wood, Simeon Wheelock, and Nehemiah Hall. Revolutionary War service Captain Baxter Hall was a Lexington and Bunker Hill Drummer who responded to the alarm at Lexington of April 19 of 1775 with the Uxbridge Militia Company, under Captain Joseph Chapin. He was an officer in the American Revolutionary War and also served as a drummer in Captain Samuel(or Seth) Read's company. He then served in Lieutenant Colonel Nathan Tyler's regiment (from Uxbridge) from January 21, 1777, to December 8, 1777, at Rhode Island. Later commands he served under included: Captain Job Knapp's company, and Colonel Job Cushing's regiment in the northern army, Captain Edward Seagrave, Colonel Wood, Captain Caleb Whiting, Colonel Benjamin Hawes, Captain Thomas Marshal Baker's company, and Colonel Samuel Denny's regiment. Service at West Point Baxter Hall went to West Point in 1780. He served from July to October in Captain Benjamin Read's company, part of Colonel John Rand's regiment. He was promoted to the rank of Captain, (militia), while at West Point. From that time on he is known as \\"Captain Baxter Hall\\". In an ironic side note of history, he and his men were sent on a wild goose chase by General Benedict Arnold, during Arnold's escape to the British side, near the end of the war. Baxter Hall however remained behind at the headquarters. Later life He later moved to Whitingham, Vermont,(before 1800) where he was a farmer. He was married at Whittingham VT, and had seven children with his first wife Lydia. His second marriage was in Sutton, Massachusetts, the next town to Uxbridge, where he married Martha Patty Putnam. He had one son with his second wife. In 1830, after the death of his second wife, he returned to Uxbridge to live with his daughter Maranda. He died in 1842 at the age of 85 and is buried in the Prospect Hill Cemetery in Uxbridge. Two early US Congressman are buried in the same cemetery, along with other Revolutionary soldiers. In a second irony of history, Benedict Arnold's widow, known locally as \\"Sarah Arnold\\", may have died at Uxbridge in 1836, while Baxter Hall resided here. The photo below depicts the Prospect Hill Cemetery (foreground) where Baxter Hall is interred. The mill in the background manufactured US military uniforms for over 140 years, beginning its legacy work in 1820, while Baxter Hall lived nearby. Significance in history Baxter Hall drummed for the first \\"muster\\" of the American revolution.

Life He was the only son of Henry Ley, 2nd Earl of Marlborough, whom he succeeded in 1638. Marlborough was General of Ordnance in the West for Charles I in 1643, during the English Civil War, and later in the year was appointed Admiral of the Royal fleet at Dartmouth. Through diligent study, Marlborough gained a reputation as an able mathematician and navigator. He founded an English colony in St Croix in 1645, which was, however, destroyed in 1650. He proposed to embark on another colonizing venture in 1649, which was apparently unsuccessful. After the Restoration, in late 1661, he was given command of HMS Dunkirk and sent out as commodore of a squadron to claim Bombay, which had been ceded to England as the dowry of Catherine of Braganza on her marriage to the English king, Charles II. The fleet carried the last Portuguese governor of Bombay, Ant√≥nio de Melo de Castro and the first English governor Abraham Shipman. However, the Portuguese were able to stall the handover by a variety of pretexts, and Marlborough was forced to land the garrison troops sent with him on Anjadip Island and return home with his ships. He was in 1664 nominated as the next Governor of Jamaica but was shortly afterwards given command of the 70-gun second-rate Old James and was killed in 1665 at the Battle of Lowestoft attempting to recover a captured ship.

Early life and influences Souders was born in Chickasha, Oklahoma. Hoping to become an illustrator he attended Trimble Technical High School in Fort Worth where he received daily instruction in commercial art. At age 14, his parents also enrolled him in a home study correspondence course offered by Art Instruction Schools which was founded in 1914 and well known for its \\"Draw Me\\" art introductory tests. He attended the University of Texas at Arlington where he received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in graphic design. On August 5, 1972, three months before his 18th birthday, Souders dove into a local lake and hit a submerged object. He broke his neck and sustained a paralyzing spinal cord injury resulting in incomplete tetraplegia. He adapted and gradually regained enough function to write, paint and live independently. His drawing hand is paralyzed so his artworks are created entirely with wrist and arm movement. Career=Beginning Upon graduating college in May 1978, Souders was employed for a short time at a local advertising agency. He had his first one-man show of paintings on November 8, 1978. Based on the success of this first show, he left advertising to concentrate on painting full-time. Many millions of Texans had a piece of Souders art in their home and or office when Southwestern Bell selected a painting called \\"County Seat\\" for the cover of the 1984‚Äì1985 phone book in Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth. The painting featured a red stone courthouse typical of many historic Texas courthouses. Partnerships Since 1990 Souders has created artworks for the Walt Disney Company.

His father is of Jewish descent and his mother is Russian.Hot Berkeley prof gets his kit off for calculusLove and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality by Edward Frenkel As a high school student he studied higher mathematics privately with Evgeny Evgenievich Petrov, although his initial interest was in quantum physics rather than mathematics. He was not admitted to Moscow State University because of discrimination against Jews and enrolled instead in the applied mathematics program at the Gubkin University of Oil and Gas. While a student there, he attended the seminar of Israel Gelfand and worked with Boris Feigin and Dmitry Fuchs. After receiving his degree in 1989, he was first invited to Harvard University as a visiting professor, and a year later he enrolled as a graduate student at Harvard. He received his Ph.D. at Harvard University in 1991, after one year of study, under the direction of Boris Feigin and Joseph Bernstein.Edward Frenkel at Mathematics Genealogy Project He was a Junior Fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows from 1991 to 1994, and served as an associate professor at Harvard from 1994 to 1997. He has been a professor of mathematics at University of California, Berkeley, since 1997. Mathematical work Jointly with Boris Feigin, Frenkel constructed the free field realizations of affine Kac‚ÄìMoody algebras (these are also known as Wakimoto modules), defined the quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction, and described the center of the universal enveloping algebra of an affine Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra. The last result, often referred to as Feigin‚ÄìFrenkel isomorphism, has been used by Alexander Beilinson and Vladimir Drinfeld in their work on the geometric Langlands correspondence. Together with Nicolai Reshetikhin, Frenkel introduced deformations of W-algebras and q-characters of representations of quantum affine algebras. Frenkel's recent work has focused on the Langlands program and its connections to representation theory, integrable systems, geometry, and physics. Together with Dennis Gaitsgory and Kari Vilonen, he has proved the geometric Langlands conjecture for GL(n). His joint work with Robert Langlands and Ng√¥ B·∫£o Ch√¢u suggested a new approach to the functoriality of automorphic representations and trace formulas. He has also been investigating (in particular, in a joint work with Edward Witten) connections between the geometric Langlands correspondence and dualities in quantum field theory. Awards Frenkel was the first recipient of the Hermann Weyl Prize in 2002. Among his other awards are Packard Fellowship in Science and Engineering and Chaire d'Excellence from Fondation Sciences math√©matiques de Paris. In 2013 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society, for \\"contributions to representation theory, conformal field theory, affine Lie algebras, and quantum field theory\\".2014 Class of the Fellows of the AMS, American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2013-11-04. In 2014 Frenkel was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Filmmaking Frenkel has co-produced, co-directed (with Reine Graves) and played the lead in a short film Rites of Love and Math, a homage to the film Rite of Love and Death (also known as Y√ªkoku) by the Japanese writer Yukio Mishima. The film premiered in Paris in April, 2010 and was in the official competition of the Sitges International Film Festival in October, 2010. The screening of Rites of Love and Math in Berkeley on December 1, 2010 caused some controversy. He has also written (with Thomas Farber) a screenplay The Two-Body Problem. He has appeared on the Numberphile YouTube series, created by Brady Haran. Love and Math Frenkel's book Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality was published in October 2013. It was a New York Times bestseller, was named one of the Best Books of 2013 by Amazon and iBooks, and was the 2015 winner of the Euler Book Prize.Euler Book Prize, Mathematical Association of America, retrieved 2015-08-03. As of February 2016, it has been published in 16 languages. Frenkel's websiteLove and Math is 304 pages long in the English version. In a review published in The New York Review of Books, Jim Holt called Love and Math a \\"winsome new memoir\\" which is \\"three things: a Platonic love letter to mathematics; an attempt to give the layman some idea of its most magnificent drama-in-progress; and an autobiographical account, by turns inspiring and droll, of how the author himself came to be a leading player in that drama.‚Äù The New York Times review called the book \\"powerful, passionate and inspiring.\\" Keith Devlin wrote in The Huffington Post: ‚ÄúWith every page, I found my mind's eye conjuring up a fictional image of the book's author, writing by candlelight in the depths of the Siberian winter like Omar Sharif's Doctor Zhivago in the David Lean movie adaptation of Pasternak's famous novel. Love and Math is Edward Frenkel's Lara poems... As is true for all the great Russian novels, you will find in Frenkel's tale that one person's individual story of love and overcoming adversity provides both a penetrating lens on society and a revealing mirror into the human mind.‚Äù Peter Woit, author of Not Even Wrong, wrote in a Sept 2013 blog post:http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=6266 :Edward Frenkel's new book Love and Math E. Frenkel: \\"Love & Math, The Heart of Hidden Reality\\", Basic Books, 2013. is now out. :The Love of the title is much more about love of mathematics than love of another person, as Frenkel provides a detailed story of what it is like to fall in love with mathematics, then pursue this deeply, ending up doing mathematics at the highest level. Along the way, there are lots of different things going on in the book, all of them quite interesting. :A large part of the book is basically a memoir, recounting Frenkel's eventful career, which began in a small city in the former Soviet Union. He explains how he fell in love with mathematics, his struggles with the grotesque anti-Semitism of the Soviet system of that time, his experiences with Gelfand and others, and how he came to the US and ended up beginning a successful academic career in the West at Harvard. :Perhaps the most remarkable part of the book though is the way it makes a serious attempt to tackle the problem of explaining the Langlands program. To anyone who wants to learn more about this subject, the best advice for how to proceed is to read the overview in Love & Math and then try reading some of his more technical surveys, such as the ones cited here, here, and here...

Includes the front-line along the Elbe from which U.S. troops withdrew in July 1945 As Allied troops entered and occupied German territory during the later stages of World War II, mass rapes of women took place both in connection with combat operations and during the subsequent occupation of Germany. Most Western scholars agree that the majority of the rapes were committed by Soviet servicemen, while some Russian historians maintain that these crimes were not widespread. The wartime rapes had been surrounded by decades of silence. According to Antony Beevor, whose books were banned in 2015 from some Russian schools and colleges, NKVD (Soviet secret police) files have revealed that the leadership knew what was happening, but did little to stop it. Some Russian historians disagree, claiming that the Soviet leadership took some action. Soviet troops Historians have written about sexual violence committed by the armies of the Western Allies and the Red Army as these forces fought their way into the Third Reich and during the period of occupation. On the territory of Nazi Germany, it began on 21 October 1944 when troops of the Red Army crossed the bridge over the Angerapp creek (marking the border) and committed the Nemmersdorf massacre before they were beaten back a few hours later. The majority of the assaults were committed in the Soviet occupation zone; estimates of the numbers of German women raped by Soviet soldiers have ranged up to 2 million. According to historian William Hitchcock, in many cases women were the victims of repeated rapes, some as many as 60 to 70 times. At least 100,000 women are believed to have been raped in Berlin, based on surging abortion rates in the following months and contemporary hospital reports, with an estimated 10,000 women dying in the aftermath.Atina Grossmann. A Question of Silence: The Rape of German Women by Occupation Soldiers October, Vol. 72, Berlin 1945: War and Rape \\"Liberators Take Liberties\\" (Spring, 1995), pp. 42‚Äì63 MIT Press Female deaths in connection with the rapes in Germany, overall, are estimated at 240,000.Helke Sander/Barbara Johr: BeFreier und Befreite, Fischer, Frankfurt 2005Seidler/Zayas: Kriegsverbrechen in Europa und im Nahen Osten im 20. Jahrhundert, Mittler, Hamburg Berlin Bonn 2002 Antony Beevor describes it as the \\"greatest phenomenon of mass rape in history\\", and has concluded that at least 1.4 million women were raped in East Prussia, Pomerania and Silesia alone. According to Soviet war correspondent Natalya Gesse, Soviet soldiers raped German females from eight to eighty years old. Soviet and Polish women were not spared either.Antony Beevor, The Fall of Berlin 1945. Richard Bessel, Germany 1945. When General Tsygankov, head of the political department of the First Ukrainian Front, reported to Moscow the mass rape of Soviet women deported to Germany for forced labour, he recommended that the women be prevented from describing their ordeal on their return to Russia. When Yugoslav politician Milovan Djilas complained about rapes in Yugoslavia, Stalin reportedly stated that he should \\"understand it if a soldier who has crossed thousands of kilometres through blood and fire and death has fun with a woman or takes some trifle.\\"Anne Applebaum, Iron Curtain, The Crushing of Eastern Europe, p.32 On another occasion, when told that Red Army soldiers sexually maltreated German refugees, he reportedly said: \\"We lecture our soldiers too much; let them have their initiative.\\" Studies Historian Norman Naimark writes that after mid-1945, Soviet soldiers caught raping civilians were usually punished to some degree, ranging from arrest to execution. The rapes continued until the winter of 1947‚Äì48, when Soviet occupation authorities finally confined Soviet troops to strictly guarded posts and camps, separating them from the residential population in the Soviet zone of Germany. In his analysis of the motives behind the extensive Soviet rapes, Norman Naimark singles out \\"hate propaganda, personal experiences of suffering at home, and an allegedly fully demeaning picture of German women in the press, not to mention among the soldiers themselves\\" as a part reason for the widespread rapes. Naimark also noted the effect that tendency to binge- drink alcohol (of which much was available in Germany) had on the propensity of Soviet soldiers to commit rape, especially rape-murder. Naimark also notes the allegedly patriarchal nature of Russian culture, and of the Asian societies comprising the Soviet Union, where dishonor was in the past repaid by raping the women of the enemy. The fact that the Germans had a much higher standard of living visible even when in ruins \\"may well have contributed allegedly to a national inferiority complex among Russians\\". Combining \\"Russian feelings of inferiority\\", the resulting need to restore honor, and their desire for revenge may be the reason many women were raped in public as well as in front of husbands before both were killed. According to Antony Beevor, revenge was not the only reason for the frequent rapes; but the Soviet troops' feeling of entitlement to all types of spoils of war, including women, was an important factor as well. Beevor exemplifies this with his discovery that Soviet troops also raped Soviet and Polish girls and women that were liberated from Nazi concentration camps as well as those who were held for forced labour at farms and factories. They were often committed by rear echelon units. The description of the events by Beevor was challenged by Makhmut Gareev who said the work by Beevor was worse than Goebbel's propaganda. According to Russian historian Oleg Rzheshevsky, 4,148 Red Army officers and \\"a significant number\\" of soldiers were convicted of atrocities for crimes committed against German civilians. Richard Overy, a historian from King's College London, has criticised the viewpoint put forth by the Russians, asserting that they refuse to acknowledge Soviet war crimes committed during the war, \\"Partly this is because they felt that much of it was justified vengeance against an enemy who committed much worse, and partly it was because they were writing the victors' history.\\" Geoffrey Roberts writes that the Red Army raped women in every country they passed through, but mostly in Austria and Germany: 70,000‚Äì100,000 rapes in Vienna, and \\"hundreds of thousands\\" of rapes in Germany. He notes that the German Army probably committed tens of thousands of rapes on the Eastern Front, but that murder was the more typical crime for them. In 2015, Beevor's books were banned in some Russian schools and colleges. Eyewitness accounts A documentary book, War's Unwomanly Face by Svetlana Alexievich includes memories by Soviet veterans about their experience in Germany.Svetlana Aleksievich, War‚Äôs Unwomanly Face, Moscow : Progress Publishers. 1988. According to a former army officer: \\"We were young, strong, and four years without women. So we tried to catch German women and ... Ten men raped one girl. There were not enough women; the entire population run from the Soviet Army. So we had to take young, twelve or thirteen year- old. If she cried, we put something into her mouth. We thought it was fun. Now I can not understand how I did it. A boy from a good family... But that was me.\\" A woman telephone operator from the Soviet Army recalled that: \\"When we occupied every town, we had first three days for looting and ... [rapes]. That was unofficial of course. But after three days one could be court-martialed for doing this. ... I remember one raped German woman laying naked, with hand grenade between her legs. Now I feel shame, but I did not feel shame back then... Do you think it was easy to forgive [the Germans]? We hated to see their clean undamaged white houses. With roses. I wanted them to suffer. I wanted to see their tears. ... Decades had to pass until I started feeling pity for them.\\" While serving as an artillery officer in East Prussia, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn witnessed war crimes against local German civilians by Soviet military personnel. Of the atrocities, Solzhenitsyn wrote: \\"You know very well that we've come to Germany to take our revenge\\". Social effects The exact number of German women and girls raped by Soviet troops during the war and occupation is uncertain, but western historians estimate their numbers are likely in the hundreds of thousands, and possibly as many as two million. The number of babies, who came to be known as \\"Russian Children\\", born as a result is unknown. However, most rapes did not result in pregnancies, and many pregnancies did not result in the victims giving birth. Abortions were the preferred choice of rape victims, and many died as a consequence of internal injuries after being brutally violated, untreated sexually transmitted diseases due to a lack of medicine, badly performed abortions, and suicides, particularly for traumatised victims who had been raped many times. In addition, many children died in post-war Germany as a result of widespread starvation, scarce supplies, and diseases such as typhus and diphtheria. The infant mortality in Berlin reached up to 90 percent. As to the social effects of this sexual violence Norman Naimark notes: West Berliners and women of the wartime generation refer to the Soviet War Memorial in Treptower Park, Berlin, as the \\"tomb of the unknown rapist\\" in response to the mass rapes by Red Army soldiers in 1945 during and after the Battle of Berlin.Ksenija Bilbija, Jo Ellen Fair, Cynthia E., The art of truth-telling about authoritarian rule, Univ of Wisconsin Press, 2005, p70Allan Cochrane, Making Up Meanings in a Capital City: Power, Memory and Monuments in Berlin, European Urban and Regional Studies, Vol. 13, No. 1, 5‚Äì24 (2006)J.M. Dennis, Rise and Fall of the German Democratic Republic 1945‚Äì1990, p.9, Longman, Hannelore Kohl, the wife of former West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, had been gang-raped at age 12 by Soviet soldiers in May 1945, according to her biographer. As a consequence, she sustained a serious lifelong back injury after being thrown out of a first-floor window. She had been suffering long and serious illnesses that experts thought of as the consequence of childhood trauma. Hannelore committed suicide in 2001. In Soviet literature Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn took part in the invasion of Germany, and wrote a poem about it called Prussian Nights. Parts of the poem read \\"Twenty-two Hoeringstrasse. It's not been burned, just looted, rifled. A moaning by the walls, half muffled: the mother's wounded, half alive. The little daughter's on the mattress, dead. How many have been on it? A platoon, a company perhaps? A girl's been turned into a woman, a woman turned into a corpse.... The mother begs, 'Soldier, kill me!'\\"Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Prussian Nights: A Poem [Prusskie nochi], Robert Conquest, trans. (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1977). Records of sexual violence were found in works of other Soviet authors, mostly in the form of war memoirs mentioning particular incidents witnessed by the authors, such as Lev Kopelev, Vladimir Gelfand, Mikhail Koryakov, Eugenii Plimak, David Samoilow, Boris Slutskii, Nikolay Nikulin, Grigorii Pomerants, Leonid Ryabichev and Vassily Grossman. Vera Dubina and Oleg Budnitskii were among those few historians who investigated the subject more systematically. In popular culture As most women recoiled from their experiences and had no desire to recount them, most biographies and depictions of the period, like the 2004 German film Downfall, alluded to mass rape by the Red Army but stopped shy of mentioning it explicitly. As time has progressed more works have been produced that have directly addressed the issue, such as the books The 158-Pound Marriage and My Story (1961) by Gemma LaGuardia Gluck [reissued as Fiorello's Sister: Gemma La Guardia Gluck's Story (Religion, Theology, and the Holocaust) (2007, Expanded Edition)], or the 2006 films Joy Division and The Good German. The topic is the subject of much feminist discourse. The first autobiographical work depicting the events was the ground-breaking 1954 book A Woman in Berlin, which was made into a 2008 feature film. It was widely rejected in Germany after its initial publication but has seen a new acceptance and many women have found inspiration to come forward with their own stories.'In Berlin,' The Diary Of One Who Stayed U.S. troops In Taken by Force, J. Robert Lilly estimates the number of rapes committed by U.S. servicemen in Germany to be 11,040.Taken by Force: Rape and American GIs in Europe during World War II. J Robert Lilly. p.12 As in the case of the American occupation of France after the D-Day invasion, many of the American rapes in Germany in 1945 were gang rapes committed by armed soldiers at gunpoint.Harrington, Carol (2010). Politicization of Sexual Violence: From Abolitionism to Peacekeeping. London: Ashgate. pp. 80‚Äì81. . Although non-fraternization policies were instituted for the Americans in Germany, the phrase \\"copulation without conversation is not fraternization\\" was used as a motto by United States Army troops.Schrijvers, Peter (1998). The Crash of Ruin: American Combat Soldiers in Europe During World War II. New York: New York University Press. p. 183. . The journalist Osmar White, a war correspondent from Australia who served with the American troops during the war, wrote that A typical victimization with sexual assault by drunken American personnel marching through occupied territory involved threatening a German family with weapons, forcing one or more women to engage in sex, and putting the entire family out on the street afterward. As in the eastern sector of the occupation, the number of rapes peaked in 1945, but a high rate of violence against the German and Austrian populations by the Americans lasted at least into the first half of 1946, with five cases of dead German women found in American barracks in May and June 1946 alone. Carol Huntington writes that the American soldiers who raped German women and then left gifts of food for them may have permitted themselves to view the act as a prostitution rather than rape. Citing the work of a Japanese historian alongside this suggestion, Huntington writes that Japanese women who begged for food \\"were raped and soldiers sometimes left food for those they raped.\\" The black soldiers of America's segregated occupation force were both more likely to be charged with rape and severely punished. Heide Fehrenbach writes that, while the American black soldiers were in fact by no means free from indiscipline, In 2015, German news magazine Der Spiegel reported that German historian Miriam Gebhardt \\"believes that members of the US military raped as many as 190,000 German women by the time West Germany regained sovereignty in 1955, with most of the assaults taking place in the months immediately following the US invasion of Nazi Germany. The author bases her claims in large part on reports kept by Bavarian priests in the summer of 1945.\\" British troops Sean Longden states that while not on the scale of the Red Army in the Soviet Zone, the British Military Police regularly investigated reports of rape. However the numbers were small compared to the number of desertions: Longden mentions that some rapes were carried out by soldiers either suffering from post traumatic stress or drunk, but that these were not considered as serious as the less common premeditated crimes. Longden mentions that on 16 April 1945 three women in Neustadt am R√ºbenberge were raped, however he does not make clear if this was one incident or three separate ones. He also does not make clear if they were spontaneous or premeditated. He gives an example of a premeditated rape: In the village of Oyle, near Nienburg, an attempted rape of two local girls at gunpoint by two soldiers ended in the death of one of the girls when, whether intentionally or not, one of the soldiers shot her. In a third example Longden highlights that not all British officers were willing to punish their men: When a German woman reported a rape to a British Army medic, two British soldiers were identified by the woman in a line up as the perpetrators, however their commanding officer declined to take any action because \\"they were going on leave\\". Clive Emsley quotes a senior British Army chaplain as reporting that there was \\"a good deal of rape going on, those who suffer [rape] have probably deserved it\\", but adds that this probably referred to attacks by former slave labourers (displaced persons) seeking revenge. Longden also mentions such incidents and highlights that for a time Hanover (in the British zone) was in a state of anarchy with deplaced persons raping and murdering German civilians. Initially when German family members approached the overstretched British authorities about murders they were told \\"we only have time for living people here\\". French troops French troops took part in the invasion of Germany, and France was assigned an occupation zone in Germany. Perry Biddiscombe quotes the original survey estimates that the French for instance committed \\"385 rapes in the Constance area; 600 in Bruchsal; and 500 in Freudenstadt.\\" French soldiers were alleged to have committed widespread rape in the H√∂fingen District near Leonberg.Stephenson, Jill (2006) Hitler's Home Front: W√ºrttemberg under the Nazis London: Continuum. p. 289. . Katz and Kaiser,Katz, Kaiser \\"[Chaos, Angst und leise Hoffnung. Kriegsende und franz√∂sische Besatzung, in: Cornelia Kaiser, Ingrid Katz, Zwischen Hunger und Hoffnung. Nachkriegsalltag in Leonberg, Leonberg 1998, S. 7‚Äì12] though they mention rape, found no specific occurrences in either H√∂fingen or Leonberg compared to other towns. According to Norman Naimark, French Moroccan troops matched the behaviour of Soviet troops when it came to rape, in particular in the early occupation of Baden and W√ºrttemberg, provided the numbers are correct. Discourse It has been frequently repeated that the wartime rapes were surrounded by decades of silence or, until relatively recently, ignored by academics, with the prevailing attitude being that the Germans were the perpetrators of war crimes, Soviet writings speaking only of Russian liberation and German guilt, and Western historians concentrating on the details of the Holocaust. In post-war Germany, especially in West Germany, the wartime rape stories became an essential part of political discourse and that the rape of German women (along with the expulsion of Germans from the East and Allied occupation) had been universalized in an attempt to situate the German population on the whole as victims. However, it has been argued that it was not a \\"universal\\" story of women being raped by men, but of German women being abused and violated by an army that fought Nazi Germany and liberated death camps.

A lava channel is a stream of fluid lava contained within zones of static (i.e., solid and stationary) lava or lava levees. The initial channel may not contain levees per se, until the parental flow solidifies over what develops into the channel and creates natural levees. This initial levee allows for the building of a more complex levee and channel. As the lava flows through the channel, the elevation of the surface of the lava flow pulsates and lava can possibly flood the associated channel walls spilling out of the channel and over the existing levees, creating what is known as overflow levees. Overflow levees increase the height and width of the original levee. The lava that flows in lava channels is commonly basaltic in composition.

(US quarter and Mexican peso at lower left.) Mote (from Quechua: mut'i, through Spanish mote) is the generic name for several varieties of corn grains boiled, consumed in many regions of South America. It is usually prepared by boiling the grains in water made alkaline by the addition of ashes or lime, a process known as nixtamalization. Argentina In Argentina, mote is consumed primarily in the mountainous northwest region, and less frequently in Cuyo and Patagonia. It is a stew of thin consistency (this is one of the main differences with the soup called locro) made from white hominy, sometimes peeled, and boiled with jume ash. The grains are usually accompanied with small pieces of meat (llama, goat, mutton, beef, pork, poultry and more rarely viscacha and mulita). It is also made with beans and with wheat. In Patagonia, in the northern region, in addition to the stew, it is consumed accompanied with some sort of cool drink, either water, juice, tea, soft drinks, with or without the addition of sugar. Bolivia In Bolivia \\"mote\\" refers to grain cooked in its husk. Typically, corn is used; fava beans are also used occasionally. When the husk is removed from the grain, the dish is called pelado. The term pelado used alone refers to corn. Wheat pelado is used mainly in soups. Chile When the term \\"mote\\" is used alone, it refers to wheat mote, that is wheat grain boiled and removed from its husk, generally in an industrial process. It is used mainly to make a sweet beverage called mote con huesillos. Salted, it is used to accompany stews and sauces (guisos), in dishes such as porotos con mote, mote guisado and papas con mote. It is also used in soups. In Mapuche cuisine it is used for making a type of dough called catuto in Spanish (m√ºltr√ºn in Mapudungun), for making a slightly alcoholic drink called muday, and as an ingredient in many foods, such as cazuelas and kakoiyael (\\"food of mote\\"). Corn mote (motem√©i, from mote de ma√≠z) is a husked grain which is used in desserts and savory foods. Ecuador Mote pata. In Ecuador, \\"mote\\" refers to corn kernels that have been boiled and cooked, which are served peeled. They often accompany popular dishes such as hornado and fritada. They are used in many soups, including caldo de patas. It is also the main ingredient in dishes typical of the city of Cuenca, such as mote pillo, mote sucio and mote pata. Peru and Colombia In Peru and Colombia, mote refers to husked white corn kernels that have been boiled with charcoal or firewood, today with calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) powder. In Cusco, Peru, there is a variety called giant corn mote of Cusco (ma√≠z mote gigante del Cusco) that is known for its large size. In Peru, wheat cooked in the manner described above is known as wheat mote (mote del trigo). Venezuela In Venezuela, this dish is known as mute and consists of husked white corn kernels boiled with ash or calcium hydroxide until they burst completely. In central Venezuela, pork and spices are added to the dish to provide flavor. In the Andean region, it is made with beef stomach (tripe) and in the states of Lara and Yaracuy with goat organs such as liver and kidneys. Corn prepared in this way is used for the arepa pelada from the state of Falc√≥n.

It was a subordinate unit of the 41st Fires Brigade (United States). History The 21st Field Artillery was constituted in the Regular Army on 1 July 1916 and organized at Camp Wilson, Texas on 1 June 1917. It was assigned to the 5th Division in 1917 and saw action in France during World War I, participating in the St. Mihiel and Lorraine (1918) Campaigns. The 21st Field Artillery was inactivated 23 September 1921 at Camp Bragg, North Carolina. On 24 March 1923 it was assigned to the 9th Division and relieved 1 January 1930 from assignment to the 9th Division. It was then assigned to the 5th Division and later redesignated as the 5th Infantry Division. Following World War I, the 21st Field Artillery was retired until 6 October 1939 when it was reactivated as part of the 5th Division. The 21st Field Artillery fought in the World War II campaigns of Normandy, Northern France, the Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and Central Europe. The 21st Field Artillery was inactivated on 20 September 1946 at Ladd Field, Alaska. Then activated 3 June 1948 at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, inactivated 30 April 1950 at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, activated 1 March 1951 at Indiantown Gap Military Reservation, Pennsylvania, inactivated 1 September 1953 at Indiantown Gap Military Reservation, Pennsylvania, activated 25 May 1954 in Germany, inactivated 1 June 1957 at Fort Ord, California, and relieved from assignment to the 5th Infantry Division; concurrently, redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 1st Battalion, 21st Artillery. It was then redesignated 1 July 1960 as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 1st Howitzer Battalion, 21st Artillery, assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division, and activated in Korea (organic elements concurrently constituted and activated). It was the redesignated 1 September 1963 as the 1st Battalion, 21st Artillery. The newly formed 1st Battalion, 21st Field Artillery began its association with the 1st Cavalry Division. During the Vietnam War, the 1st Battalion, 21st Field Artillery participated in 15 different campaigns including the Tet Counteroffensive and Counteroffensives I-VII, earning the Presidential Unit Citation for action in Pleiku Province, the Valorous Unit Award for the Fish Hook Campaign, and the Meritorious Unit Commendation for operations in Vietnam (1967). Additionally, Alpha and Bravo Batteries were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for action in Binh Thaun Province. The 1st Battalion, 21st Field Artillery was relieved 13 September 1972 from assignment to the 1st Cavalry Division and assigned to the 4th Infantry Division. It was inactivated 19 December 1973 at Fort Carson, Colorado and relieved 21 April 1975 from assignment to the 4th Infantry Division, assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division, and activated at Fort Hood, Texas. On 2 July 1986, the 1st Battalion, 21st Field Artillery was reorganized and redesignated as Battery A, 21st Field Artillery, and continued to serve in the 1st Cavalry Divisionry. In August 1990, the 1st Cavalry Division was alerted for deployment to Southwest Asia as part of the joint forces participating in Operation Desert Shield. 1st Cavalry Division MLRS fires from Alpha Battery, 21st Field Artillery illuminated the night skies and crippled Iraqi targets deep within enemy territory. Upon activation on 16 September 1997, with the addition of Bravo (MLRS) and Charlie (Target Acquisition) Batteries, the 1st Battalion, 21st Field Artillery became the first Divisional MLRS Command and Attack Battalion in the U.S. Army. In September 1998, Charlie Battery, 1st Battalion, 21st Field Artillery deployed to Bosnia-Herzegovina to provide 24-hour radar support to Task Force Eagle. On 28 July 2000, 68th Chemical Company, the division's smoke, reconnaissance, and decontamination forces, became part of the battalion. The 1st Battalion, 21st Field Artillery completed the Army's first deployment of a divisional command and attack battalion, Operation Desert Strike 01-07, an external evaluation at Fort Bliss, New Mexico, in April 2001. In support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 68th Chemical Company and the 1‚Äì227 FSE out of HHS/1-21, deployed from February 2003 through June 2003. The FSE planned and executed SEAD missions in support of Apache deep attacks. 68th Chemical Company's Smoke Platoon, while attached to 3rd Infantry Division, crossed the border into Iraq and were among the first U.S. soldiers to enter Baghdad. In March 2004, Task Force 1‚Äì21 deployed to Iraq for combat operations under the task organization of the 5th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division during Operation Iraqi Freedom II. Organic companies of 1‚Äì21 FA were augmented by elements of the 68th Chemical Company to form the task force. Task Force Rocket was responsible for a portion of the Al-Rasheed district in southern Baghdad from March 2004 ‚Äì March 2005. During that time the task force conducted daily patrols, ambushes, raids, convoy escorts, target acquisition, and counter-battery cannon fires. The battalion contributed to the first ever free elections held in Iraq in January 2005. Following redeployment, Charlie Battery, 1‚Äì21 FA and 68th Chemical Company were inactivated in July 2005. The 1st Cavalry Division's first Silver Star Medal for valor in combat during this deployment was presented to Pfc. Christopher Fernandez, of Battery A, 1st Battalion, 21st Field Artillery Regiment, on 13 August 2004. Fernandez was awarded the Silver Star for his actions on the night of 5 May, when his unit were ambushed while on a patrol through the city's Saidiyah neighborhood. An improvised explosive device rendered the patrol's rear vehicle inoperable. The patrol was hit with small-arms fire and immediately returned fire. Two U.S. soldiers were killed and five others were wounded in the IED explosion. Fernandez returned fire with his M-249 Squad Automatic Weapon, reloading it at least once during the short engagement, said Capt. Thomas Pugsley, Battery A's commander. Seeing that the stricken vehicle's M-240B machine gun was unused. Fernandez left his vehicle, ran to the disabled humvee and recovered the weapon and its ammunition. Fernandez then opened fire on the enemy. The hand guards covering the machine-gun's barrel, so the gunner's hands will not burn, were blown off in the explosion. Fernandez kept firing even though his hands were burning. One other soldier received a Bronze Star with V device and another received an Army Commendation with V device. On 19 August 2005, the 1st Battalion 21st Field Artillery was relieved from the 1st Cavalry Division and attached to the 4th Fires Brigade. The 1st Battalion 21st Field Artillery made its transition as part of the Army's new modular transformation concept. Falling under the newly formed fires brigade model, in 2006 the battalion fielded and manned the 575th Forward Support Company and Charlie (MLRS) Battery, 1‚Äì21 FA.

Behind the dam is the lake known as the Kelbra Reservoir (Stausee Kelbra) or Kelbra Flood Retention Basin (Hochwasserr√ºckhaltebecken Kelbra).  Purpose  The dam was built to provide flood protection and its reservoir collects the waters of the Harz flowing into the southern Harz Foreland via the River Helme and its tributaries. The reservoir lake stores water for irrigation and is used for angling and recreation. Both dam and lake are operated jointly and cooperatively by the Thuringian Long Distance Water Supply (Th√ºringer Fernwasserversorgung) and the Saxony-Anhalt Dam Company (Talsperrenbetrieb von Sachsen-Anhalt).  Dam  The Kelbra Dam was built from 1962 to 1966 between Berga and Kelbra in the region known as the Goldene Aue between Nordhausen in the west and Sangerhausen in the east. It is located in the district of Mansfeld-S√ºdharz (Saxony-Anhalt) on the northwestern end of the Kyffh√§user hills. It is only a few kilometres from the border with the state of Thuringia and impounds the river system of the Helme into the Kelbra Reservoir. Its main and auxiliary barriers are earth-fill dams made of gravel and binding material (Erdstoffen). Both have a sloping internal grout curtain of clay on the water side. The crest of the main dam is 4,066 m long and 7 m above the valley floor; the acute-angled auxiliary dam is 3,379 m long. On the southern shore of the lake is the Numburg Cave.  Reservoir  The Kelbra Reservoir lies on the river Helme behind the Kelbra Dam at the northwestern foot of the Kyffh√§user hills. It is located within the Goldene Aue, mainly in the district of Mansfeld-S√ºdharz (Saxony-Anhalt); only a small area in its extreme southwestern sector, which is on the border of the Kyffh√§userkreis and Nordhausen districts, lies in Thuringia, which touches its southwestern shore. Initially only a green - i.e. normally dry - flood retention basin was planned. In the event, however, a full dam was built in order to create a permanent reservoir, and an auxiliary dam, in order to provide a basin that absorbed the bulk of the Helme river system in the event of high water. As a result, there are two adjacent basins, the lower one being permanently impounded ‚Äì i.e. as a permanent lake ‚Äì a gauge on the lake indicating a height of , a storage volume of 12.3 million m¬≥ and a surface area of about 600 ha. The upper basin, which is bordered on its western and northwestern shores by arable and pasture land, is only impounded during times of high water. Together, both basins have a volume of 35.6 million m¬≥, of which 23 million m¬≥ is exclusive flood control capacity. Following the completion of the trial impounding of the Kelbra Reservoir, which lasted until 1969, it was officially taken into service. The lake is used extensively for tourist purposes and has facilities for sailing and windsurfing, a beach for swimming, a campsite, boat and bicycle hire, a petting zoo a waterslide and, near the lake, various inns and other facilities.  Internationally important bird habitat  The reservoir is of international importance as a result of the variety of birds found on and around its waters, which, in terms of species as well as sheer numbers exceeds those settling on comparable stretches of water. For example, the following birds can regularly be observed here: duck (e.g. mallard, teal, pochard), waders (peewit, snipe, redshank, curlew), divers (great crested grebe, little grebe, black-necked grebe), rails (water rail, coot), mute swan, black-headed gull and bittern (little bittern and Eurasian bittern). In addition white-tailed eagle, osprey, peregrine and cormorant may also be spotted here. The variety of birds occurring during migration is particularly impressive. Up to 10,000 crane stop over on the reservoir and large flocks of larks and finches may be seen passing through. Since 1978 the reservoirs has been placed under the protection of the Ramsar Convention as an internationally important retreat for birds.

It is possibly derived from the Middle English word \\"drane\\", or drone, the male honey bee. The first Drowne/Drown in North America was Leonard Drowne (1646‚Äì1729) who came from Penryn, Cornwall to what was then part of Kittery in Massachusetts soon after the Restoration (England) of the monarchy in 1660. Leonard, a ship-wright, established a shipyard near Sturgeon Creek in what is now Eliot, York County, Maine. Leonard married Sarah Abbott of Portsmouth, New Hampshire around 1675. Leonard helped organize and build the first Baptist Church in Maine in 1682. During King William's War, many Maine towns were raided and English settlements were massacred by the Wabanaki people in conjunction with the French. In 1696, 28 members of the Baptist Church moved to Charleston, South Carolina and established the first Baptist church there while the Drownes moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 1699, due to the ongoing war and violence. After Sarah Abbott died, Leonard married his also-widowed sister-in law, Mary (Abbott) Caley. This marriage was performed by the Rev. Cotton Mather in Boston, November 4, 1707.

History  Prior to 1917, Bessarabian intelligentsia was divided between noblemen, conservatives, democrats, and socialists. Vasile Stroescu, a rich but very modest filantop boyar, managed to persuade all major factions to leave internal fights and at four day meeting (‚Äì) the National Moldavian Party was created. In April 1917 the party leadership was elected. It was headed by Vasile Stroescu, having among its members Paul Gore (a renowned conservative), Vladimir Her≈£a, Pan Halippa (a renowned socialist), Onisifor Ghibu. Among the leaders of the party were general Matei Donici, Ion Pelivan, Daniel Ciugureanu, Gurie Grosu, Nicolae Alexandri, Teofil Ioncu, P. Grosu, Mihail MinciunƒÉ, Vlad Bogos, F. Corobceanu, Gheorghe BuruianƒÉ, Simeon Murafa, Al. Botezat, Alexandru GroapƒÉ, Ion Codreanu, Vasile Gafencu.

Intellectuals from Bukovina, Transylvania, and the Romanian Old Kingdom fleeing the war to Bessarabia, helped with the printing of Cuv√¢nt moldovenesc, started various language, history, culture, and sciences courses, and set up a People's University (Universitatea PopularƒÉ) in Chi≈üinƒÉu.Ion Nistor, Istoria Basarabiei, CernƒÉu≈£i, 1923, reprinted Chi≈üinƒÉu, Cartea MoldoveneascƒÉ, 1991, p. 276 The party was replaced by the Bessarabian Peasants' Party, founded in Chi≈üinƒÉu on 23 August 1918.

The project has been continually funded by the National Institutes of Health since 1966. Specifically, the REP links together medical diagnosis and procedure information across all medical providers in the county. The project is a collaboration between Olmsted Medical Center, Mayo Clinic, and Rochester Family Medicine Clinic. History The REP was originally funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences in 1966 under the direction of Dr. Leonard T. Kurland, a neurologist who started his career at the NIH and moved to Olmsted County, Minnesota when he realized the great benefit to medical research that a population-based record linkage system could have. Dr. Kurland considered Olmsted County an optimal location for such a population- based research infrastructure because the county is relatively isolated from other metropolitan centers, almost all medical care is received within the county, and all medical specialties are available to county residents. More recently, the study funding source changed to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, and as of July 2010 the REP is funded by the National Institute on Aging. In September 2016, the REP celebrated 50 years of continuous NIH funding. The Population The REP includes the medical records of all persons who have ever lived in Olmsted County, Minnesota between January 1, 1966 and the present, and who have given permission for their medical information to be used for research. Those persons comprise more than 500,000 unique individuals and more than 6 million person years of follow-up through 2010. Historically, the Olmsted County population is less racially diverse than the US as a whole; however, it has been found to be similar to the state of Minnesota and surrounding states (Wisconsin, Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota). Scientific Contributions The REP has contributed significantly to the understanding of many diseases, including epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, Parkinson's disease, dementia and Alzheimer's Disease, heart failure, stroke, multiple myeloma, and many others. Since its inception, the REP has supported more than 2,600 peer-reviewed scientific publications spanning almost every field of medicine.

The Groton Monument, sometimes called the Fort Griswold Monument, is a granite monument in Groton, Connecticut. It is dedicated to the defenders who fell during the Battle of Groton Heights on September 6, 1781. The monument was originally high, but it was changed in 1881 to commemorate the centennial of the Battle of Groton Heights; the cupola was removed and replaced by an iron-capped pyramid in emulation of the Bunker Hill Monument. The Groton monument bears a plaque describing the events of the Battle of Groton Heights, and another plaque with the names of the Americans who died in the battle. Lightning destroyed the capstone in 1918 and damaged the adjacent Monument House Museum which features exhibits about the Revolutionary War. Visitors can climb the monument and visit the museum from Memorial Day through Labor Day. The Groton Monument is located in Fort Griswold Battlefield State Park, which includes Fort Griswold.  Design  The Groton Monument Association was incorporated in 1820 and hired the partnership of Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis to design the monument. The cornerstone was laid on September 6, 1825 and the monument was completed in 1830. It was originally high, but this was changed in 1881 to commemorate the centennial of the Battle of Groton Heights when the cupola was removed and replaced by an iron-capped pyramid in emulation of the Bunker Hill Monument.John Zukowsky, \\"Monumental American Obelisks: Centennial Vistas,\\" The Art Bulletin, Vol. 58, No. 4 (December 1976), pp. 574-581 As a result of these renovations, the height was extended to high.

It has seven minor spelling errors in naming, such as \\"Thomas Minard\\" for Thomas Miner.  Repairs  Groton Monument and Fort Griswold, a sketch by John Warner Barber for his Historical Collections of Connecticut (1836) The monument was repaired and the grounds were renovated with an appropriation of $5,000 from the State of Connecticut in 1893 and completed by early 1894. Lightning struck the monument in 1918, shattering the capstone and sending the pieces to the ground, then traveling through the brass railings and scattering the cards in one of the wire-racks. The lightning also jumped to the monument house and damaged the veranda, raising the brick tiling on the floor and doing minor damage inside the museum. Frederic Bill could not find a fitting match for the original capstone. In 1985, Hurricane Gloria blew out a window of the monument, and the State of Connecticut spent $6,250 to re-mortar it in 1986. The monument was closed until 1989 for the repair work. In 2007, Carol Kimball of the New London Day wrote that the State of Connecticut was not funding repairs to the historic site, but it would be required if the monument were to survive. She also referred to a New York Times article on the neglected monument and pointed out that the bond commission had yet to issue the approved $350,000 for its preservation. Other repairs would cost an additional $150,000, including sidewalks surrounding the entrance and the memorial gate.

Born in California, Missouri and raised as a child in Colorado and then Pittsburgh, his career brought him eventually to New York City, via Philadelphia and Chicago. In New York the dealer Macbeth established him as one of the leading portraitists of the 20th century and his over 500 portraits continue to decorate the galleries, rooms and halls of many of America's museums and institutions. Overview Leopold Seyffert painting William Burnham on Suttons Island, Maine 1916 Included in the many people that Seyffert painted were America's cultural, business and political elite and by the early 1940s these portraits began representing them- as they do today ‚Äì Henry Clay Frick,(Heinz History Center, Pittsburgh), Fritz Kreisler (National Portrait Gallery), Andrew Mellon (Choate School and BNY Mellon Collection), John Wanamaker (US Postal Museum), Edward T. Stotesbury (Stotesbury Collection), Elizabeth Arden, Samuel Gompers (New York Historical Society), John Graver Johnson (Corcoran Art Gallery), railroad financier Edward Brinton Smith (Private Collection), Charles Lindbergh and David Sarnoff. Seyffert was recipient of a long string of prizes and honors given by the major American art organizations and museums, often for his non-commissioned work. In these paintings (like the paintings of children by his older contemporaries, Robert Henri and George Bellows, he painted with a vigorous brushwork and palette that sometimes took into consideration more modern color and other expressive choices. As a young artist, Seyffert traveled three times to Europe in 1910, 1912, and 1914. Like many young artists he painted from Velasquez in the Prado and was influenced by Hals, Van Gogh and Goya. During these trips he used unique and different people as models and like Van Gogh he wanted ordinary people as subjects. Their unique faces and colorful costumes inspired some of his earliest works. Later his portraits, nudes and flower still lifes kept the lessons learned from these years while adding a more refined and simpler style. Seyffert's life and career spanned the first half of the 20th Century. He lived, taught and painted in several historic cities and many of his sitters played a significant role in American history, particularly during the roaring 20's. Growing up and studies Seyffert works during left Leopold Seyffert's ancestors' origins were in the Saxony region of Germany, with his grandparents hailing from Zwikau, a village near Leipzig. His grandfather and father, Hermann (at age 4) arrived in New York in 1854. The family traveled to St. Louis and then went west settling with other German immigrants in Missouri. Leopold was born in the town of California, Moniteau County, Missouri in 1887, the second youngest of seven, to Hermann and Emma Tweihaus Seyffert. The following year his family moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado where they built a cabin in the foothills of the Cheyenne Mountains on the Cheyenne Creek, near what is today The Broadmoor resort. In 1890 his father died after falling off a roof, leaving all the family having to work or marry early. Leopold's earliest art exposure came from his briefly studying with an artist named La Salle but also he painted cakes in the local bakery and glass eyes for a taxidermist. His older brother Lou moved to Pittsburgh and after getting a job in the office of Standard Oil geologist John Worthington, he sent for \\"Lee\\" and their mother to move east. In 1904, en route they visited the St. Louis World's Fair where he saw his first painting exhibition. Once in Pittsburgh Leopold began working as an office boy for Worthington and his artistic talent came to the attention of his boss. For two years he studied at the Stevenson Art School with Horatio Stevenson while living with the Worthington family and later Worthington loaned him the money to attend the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, a debt he paid off with many portraits of their family. Starting in 1906 until 1913 he studied at the Academy with Thomas Pollock Anschutz, William Merritt Chase, Cecilia Beaux and Hugh H. Breckenridge. During these lean years he worked at the local boys club and as a semi-professional baseball player, while his commissions began. Thanks to the recommendations of William Merritt Chase he painted Chase's lawyers daughter, Libby Deyoung, who later married Sylvan Levin. Chase also bought a portrait he did of his wife Helen Fleck. He did many copies of works in the Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia and these paintings, from 1905 to 1915 are little known and still hang in many spots in and around Philadelphia. Teaching and career Helen (Fleck) and Leopold Seyffert, Seal Harbor, ME, 1916 Tired Out painted in Volendam, Holland Collection: Woodmere Art Museum From 1909 to 1913, he taught at Graphic Sketch Club, Philadelphia, which now is the Samuel S. Fleisher Memorial. In 1910, he won the Cresson Traveling Scholarship, and went to Europe with his fianc√©e, the painter Helen Fleck, and her mother. In 1911 they married and in 1912, he again won the Cresson Scholarship, allowing them to travel and work in Volendam, Holland. During these years, he met Leopold Stokowski, who became a close friend, and the resulting portrait (below) won the 1913 Fellowship Prize and the Popular Prize at the Pennsylvania Academy annual. Also that year, he won honorable mention at the Carnegie International Exhibition for a Volendam painting, \\"Tired Out\\", and he was honored with a special section at Fourth Annual Exhibition of the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh.

Leopold Stokowski by Leopold Seyffert, 1912 stokowski.org In 1914, he and Helen and their first child, Mary Louise, summered in Spain where he and friend Waldo Pierce visited Ignacio Zuloaga, and painted colorful people in Segovia, including Daniel Zuloaga. The same year, he was one of three artists in group exhibition at the Memorial Art Gallery, Rochester, where he exhibited some of his early masterworks, most of which are in museums today. He continued his teaching in 1914‚Äì21 at another school, the Philadelphia School of Design for Women (now Moore College of Art) in Philadelphia, a school that at the time was managed largely by the Sartain family. In 1915 their second child, Richard (Leopold, Jr.), was born. That year he won the Gold Medal at the Philadelphia Art Club, and Silver Medal, Panama Pacific Exposition, San Francisco. In 1916 he was elected an Associate of the National Academy of Design, also winning the Beck Gold Medal at the Pennsylvania Academy, for a portrait of the violinist Fritz Kreisler, now in the National Portrait Gallery. The same year he had solo exhibitions in Boston at St. Botolph Club and Copley Gallery. He summered in Seal Harbor, Maine, (photographed left) with group of Philadelphia artists and musicians where he began series of charcoal portraits of these personalities. He returned to Seal Harbor the following summer where his second son, Peter, was born. In the fall he moved to Chicago and began teaching at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (a post he continued to hold until 1927). In December he was in a group exhibit at the Detroit Museum of Art with Karl Anderson, Hayley Lever and Ernest Lawson. Samuel S. Fleisher painted by Seyffert (1918) in one sitting for a $10,000 war bond In 1918 he won the Temple Gold Medal at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, for Lacquer Screen, now in their collection, and also both the Altman and First Hallgarten Prizes at the National Academy of Design. Lacquer Screen is one of many nudes painted of his model and likely mistress at that time, Bobbi, and paintings of her are now in major museum collections, such as the Los Angeles County Museum, Illinois State Museum, High Museum of Art and the New Orleans Museum of Art. That year he had his second group exhibition at the Memorial Art Gallery in Rochester. In 1921 he won the Thomas R. Proctor Prize for portraiture, from the National Academy of Design. Also, his association with the Art Institute of Chicago expanded with his portraits of notable citizens of Chicago included in a circuit show which they organized and sent traveling. It included financiers, artists, musicians and writers living in Chicago at that time, such as Potter Palmer Jr., Frederick Stock, Albin Polasek, and Marshall Field, Jr. In 1922 he had a solo exhibition at the Detroit Institute of Arts. In 1923 he was a founding artist member of the Grand Central Art Galleries in New York and he was chosen in its initial lottery offering with such artists as John Singer Sargent. Soon after he began to maintain a studio in New York and in 1925 Grand Central began representing him in his portrait art. Seyffert's sense of humor and congenial manner came from his roots as an immigrant child. He was determined and thoroughly enjoyed the company of his sitters. Even if they were very rich, he was never intimidated. In 1923 he won the Palmer Gold Medal, Art Institute of Chicago and later that year summered in Switzerland where his boys were attending boarding school. In 1924 he won the Logan Gold Medal and Hearst Prize, both at the Art Institute of Chicago and he had a solo exhibition at the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh. That summer he visited with his family the home of Hans & Alice Kindler in Senlis, France, where they were all photographed by Man Ray. He won the Logan Prize at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1925 and that same year had solo exhibitions at Columbus Gallery of Fine Arts, Ohio and the Grand Central Art Galleries, New York. He was elected to full membership to the National Academy of Design and he visited his family in Paris, where he painted My Family, Brooklyn Museum. He served on the annual art jury at the National Academy for the following ten years. family photo by Man Ray ca. 1925 By this point in his career he had averaged 25 paintings a year and many of his works were of those who had significant roles in American history. He was not a society portraitist though some of those who valued themselves were painted by him. More often however it was a group or company that commissioned a portrait for posterity and he painted some household names today like Heinz, Kraft, Taft, and Mellon. In 1926 he won the Stotesbury Gold Medal, Pennsylvania Academy, and Gold Medal, Philadelphia Sesquicentennial Exposition. He had a solo exhibition at Carson Pirie Scott in Chicago previously managed by Erwin S. Barrie and an article by Frederick Lowes appeared in All-Arts Magazine. In 1928 he moved to New York, where he acquired a studio at the Des Artistes, 1 W. 67th Street and during this period he developed a long time professional relationship with the American illustrators of the time, James Montgomery Flagg and Howard Chandler Christy. His 1929 exhibitions at the Detroit Institute of the Arts and the Hackett Galleries, New York, brought him further commissions and he won the Lippincott Prize at the Pennsylvania Academy with an article by George W. Eggers in American Magazine of Art appearing the same year. In 1930 he and his wife Helen Fleck divorced and he married Grace J.Vernon (\\"Bobbi\\") who had been his model for over 15 years. Her maiden name was actually Grace Heinzerling ‚Äì a name she changed to one that sounds more Anglo. That year he won the Popular Prize, Carnegie International Exhibition and had a solo exhibition of charcoal portraits at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. Seyffert, Hemingway, and Speiser in Hendaye, France 1931 courtesy The Speiser & Easterling-Hallman Collection of Ernest Hemingway, University of South Carolina Libraries In 1931 he won the Isidor Medal at National Academy of Design and that summer he travelled to Hendaye, France, spending time with his family, Maurice Speiser (a longtime friend from Philadelphia) and Ernest Hemingway (right). In 1932 he had a solo exhibition at J.J. Gillespie & Company, Pittsburgh, and Robert C. Vose Galleries, Boston. His show in Boston led to him painting several Governors of Massachusetts and the biggest benefactor of the Boston Public Library, Mr. Deferrari. At the library's entrance an entire room is devoted to this painting. Continuing his interest in painting unique and different people, in 1934 he traveled to Guatemala on a commission from the Grace Lines to paint the people of Antigua and Chichicastenango. Also that year he was chosen by Holger Cahill to paint a New York City police officer, Bernard Jeppson, with the painting to be unveiled at Rockefeller Center in the city's first Municipal Art Show. The following year he had a solo exhibition at Vose Galleries, Boston. He bought a weekend house near Westport, Connecticut in 1936 and renovated the barn into a studio. Last years He became an avid gardener and began painting flower still lifes. For the following 10 years he spent time between his country home in Easton, Connecticut and New York. In 1946 he was honored with the Gold Medal of Honor at the Allied Artists Exhibition, New York. At this point in his life his health began to deteriorate from his smoking and drinking, though his commissions continued. In 1953 while he was painting two of the National Gallery's (Washington, DC) founders, Rush and Samuel Kress, his wife Bobbi died. Both his boys, Peter and Richard (formerly Leopold, Jr.), were living in Peru. He painted his last portrait of Frank Porter Graham and also during his last years a new model and companion, Ramona, lived with and cared for him until his death from esophageal cancer in Bound Brook, New Jersey, in 1956.

This article covers some of the main streets in Rome, Italy. Via Cavour, Rome Via Cavour, Rome is a street in the Castro Pretorio rione of Rome, named after Camillo Cavour. It is served by the Rome Metro stations Cavour and Termini. Via della Conciliazione Via della Conciliazione (Conciliation StreetThe name finally settled upon for the project was chosen by journalist Franco Franchi after World War II; ) is a major street in the Rione of Borgo, leading to St. Peter's Basilica and the Vatican City. Around 500 m in length,Multimap reference () it connects Saint Peter's Square to the Castel Sant'Angelo on the western bank of the Tiber River. The road was constructed between 1937 and 1950, and it is the primary access route to the Square. In addition to shops and residences, it is bordered by a number of historical and religious buildings and palaces - including the Palazzo Torlonia, the Palazzo dei Penitenzieri and the Palazzo dei Convertendi, and the church of Santa Maria in Traspontina. Via del Corso Via del Corso seen from Altare della Patria. Via del Corso (the ancient via Lata), commonly known as the Corso, is the main street running through the historical centre of the city. It is remarkable for being absolutely straight in an area characterized by narrow meandering alleys and small piazzas. It is also wider than most streets in the centre of Rome, but still only has barely room for two lanes of traffic and two narrow sidewalks. The northern portion of the street is a pedestrian area. The length of the street is roughly 1.5 kilometres. Via dei Fori Imperiali Via dei Fori Imperiali, seen from the Colosseum looking northwest Via dei Fori Imperiali is a road in the centre of the city that runs in a straight line from the Piazza Venezia to the Colosseum. The road, whose original name was \\"Via dell'Impero\\", was built during the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini. Its course takes it over parts of the Forum of Trajan, Forum of Augustus and Forum of Nerva, parts of which can be seen on both sides of the road. There has in recent years been a great deal of archeological excavation on both sides of the road, while significant Imperial Roman structures are still under it. Via Giulia Via Giulia is a street in the historic centre of Rome, mostly in rione Regola, although its northern part belongs to rione Ponte. It was one of the first important urban planning projects in Renaissance Rome. Via Giulia was projected by Pope Julius II but the original plan was only partially carried out. This was the first attempt since antiquity to pierce a new thoroughfare through the heart of Rome and the first European example since antiquity of urban renewal. Via Giulia runs from the Ponte Sisto to the church of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini in a straight line, rather than following the tight curve of the Tiber. It became the most fashionable street for new construction for borghesi and for the Florentine community in the sixteenth century. Today its structures provide one of Rome's elite shopping streets, noted for its antique shops. Via Margutta Via Margutta is a small street in the centre of Rome, near to Piazza del Popolo, accessible as a small alley from Via del Babuino, in the old quarter of Campo Marzio, also known as \\"the foreigner's quarter\\", located near to the slopes of Mount Pincio. It is a place with many art galleries and fashionable restaurants, where before the Renaissance there were only modest craftsmen workshops and stables. In the 1950s, after the film Roman Holiday it became an exclusive road, and a residence of many famous people, like film director Federico Fellini. It can be reached from the north traveling by the Via Cassia or by Flaminia until arriving to the large square Piazzale Flaminio, and then passing through the city door in the wall that leads to Piazza del Popolo square, from this point it is a walk of several meters to the left of the Flaminio Obelisk towards Via del Babuino; on the left side of this road there is an alley that leads to Via Margutta. Via Nazionale Via Nazionale is a busy street in Rome from Piazza della Repubblica leading towards the Piazza Venezia. Already begun as the via Pia, named in honour of Pope Pius IX who had wanted to connect Stazione Termini to the city centre, the street was completed at the end of the 19th century through the ambition of several figures of the Risorgimento to create a \\"new Rome\\" as a capital of the unified Kingdom of Italy. Via Sacra The Via Sacra () is the main street of ancient Rome, leading from the top of the Capitoline Hill, through some of the most important religious sites of the Forum (where it is the widest street), to the Colosseum.

On January 18, 2010, Scott Horton asserted in an article in Harper's Magazine, the result of a joint investigation with NBC News, that such a facility was maintained outside the regular boundaries of the Guantanamo Bay detention camps. Description Estimated to be located about a mile beyond the regular camp boundaries, the camp was described as a highly secret facility referred to as \\"Camp No\\" by Guantanamo guards. When soldiers asked about it, they were told \\"No, it doesn't exist\\". The compound looked like other camps except that it was surrounded by concertina wire and had no guard towers. The guards who told Horton about it said that it looked as if it could hold 80 prisoners. Some areas looked like the interrogation centers in other parts of the main camp. They had seen non-uniformed personnel going to that area and speculated they were CIA. They suggest that the camp was used for secret interrogations, including the use of illegal interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding torture. In an account published in Harper's, guards attested they had seen three prisoners taken individually in the direction of Camp No by the vehicle they called the paddy wagon on the night of June 9. The paddy wagon contained a cage large enough to hold one prisoner at a time. All three had been taken there by 8 pm. Homicides related to Camp No Horton asserts that, according to interviews he conducted with four former camp guards, Army Staff Sergeant Joseph Hickman, and three men who served under him, the three detainees reported by the military on June 10, 2006, as having committed suicide instead having likely died while at Camp No, or soon afterward, as a result of secret interrogations under torture. The DOD had announced that the three men had died in their cellblock by hanging themselves in their cells. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) released a heavily redacted report in August 2008; it said that the three men's hangings had gone undetected for two hours. The detainees were Salah Ahmed Al-Salami, Mani al-Utaybi, and Yasser al-Zahrani. Horton wrote that DOD carried out a cover-up in asserting that the deaths were the result of suicides, all carried out the same night. He said the guards reported having seen a van, used only for the transport of individual prisoners, return that night from the direction of Camp No and go directly to the medical center, where something was unloaded. There was soon much crisis-related activity. This was before 11:45 pm, more than an hour before the first bodies of the \\"suicides\\" were reportedly discovered in the cellblock. In addition, Sergeant Hickman, whose position in a tower gave him an overview of the cellblock, said that he saw no prisoners being taken from the cellblock to the medical clinic that night. In February 2010, Brent Mickum, the lawyer for Shaker Aamer, former detainee who is a British resident, said his client had described suffering torture at a separate location outside the regular camp on June 9, 2006, when the other detainees died. He was subjected to what has been called dryboarding, which led to temporary asphyxiation. Mickum said that, from Aamer's description, he thought it \\"'likely' Mr Aamer's torture was in the same 'black site' area, Camp No, identified by the Harper's article.\\" Although Aamer was cleared for release in 2009, he was only released on 30 October 2015.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11964872/Shaker-Aamer-the-last- British-resident-held-at-Guantanamo-Bay-is-released.html See also * Strawberry Fields (Guantanamo) ReferencesExternal links *\\"US Court Denies Justice to Dead Men at Guant√°namo\\", Andy Worthington, October 3, 2010 *Alex Koppelman, \\"The National Magazine Award and Guant√°namo: A Tall Tale Gets the Prize-Scott Horton's Harper's story about detainees' deaths doesn't hold up\\", Adweek, May 23, 2011 Category:Prisons in Guantanamo Bay Category:Black sites ","title":"Camp No"},{"id":"25855109","text":"Phacelia inundata is a species of phacelia known by the common names playa yellow phacelia and playa phacelia.

One of the proponents and sponsors of Romanian nationalism in Russia's Bessarabia Governorate, as well as among the Romanian communities of Austria-Hungary, he was also a champion of self- help and of cooperative farming. He inherited or purchased large estates, progressively dividing them among local peasants, while setting up local schools and churches for their use. An erudite and traveler, he abandoned his career in law to focus on his agricultural projects and cultural activism. For the latter work, he became an honorary member of the Romanian Academy. Having backed the nationalist papers Basarabia and Cuv√¢nt Moldovenesc, Stroescu was drawn into the more elitist cell of the nationalist movement, centered on the parts of the zemstva and gentry assembly. He was thus honorary president of the National Moldavian Party shortly after the February Revolution but, with Vladimir Hertza, drifted away from the core of the movement to set up his own aristocratic branch. He became an absentee member of Sfatul »öƒÉrii during the existence of a Moldavian Democratic Republic and its union with Romania. In 1919‚Äì1920, he served in the Assembly of Deputies, and was its de facto President for one day, on November 20, 1919. Rallying with the Bessarabian Peasants' Party, Stroescu became critical of the unification process, decrying government abuses in Bessarabia, and also objected to the 1920s land reform. He died shortly after in Bucharest, having also served in the Senate, and was granted a state funeral. Biography=Beginnings The Stroescus were a family of ethnic Romanian aristocrats and shepherds from Moldavia: the family patriarch Ioan Stroescu had the Moldavian boyar title of jitnicer in the late 17th century. His grandson, Gavriil, was a »ôƒÉtrar; Ienache, Gavriil's son, reverted to pastoralism, and owned ranches in Ia»ôi County.Bezviconi (1943), p. 163 His own two sons Vasile (1795‚Äì1875) and Ioan moved between Moldavia and Bessarabia, which, following the 1812 Treaty of Bucharest, had been absorbed into the Russian Empire. Vasile owned ten estates on either side of the border, split between Ia»ôi and Hotin counties. The Stroescus were all inducted into Russian nobility in 1828 and granted arms in 1867.Bezviconi (1943), pp. 69, 163 From his marriage to Profira Manoil Gu»õu (1808‚Äì1856), Vasile Sr had three sons‚ÄîMihail (1836‚Äì1889), Gheorghe (1840‚Äì1922), Vasile Jr. The couple also had four daughters, married off to aristocrats of Russian, Greek, or Polish Bessarabian descent: Ana Kazimir, Maria Druganov, Elena Martos, and Ecaterina »òumanski.Bezviconi (1943), pp. 108, 123, 133, 163 The latter's husband was Clemente »òumanski, Mayor of Kishinev in the 1870s. Vasile Jr was born on November 11, 1845, in Trinca, a Hotin County village (now in Edine»õ District, Moldova). He attended the Bessarabian Lyceum of Kishinev, then the school of Kamenets-Podolskiy and Odessa's Richelieu Lyceum. Later, he studied law at the universities of Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Berlin.Bolovan & Bolovan, p. 23; Constantin (2010), p. 240; Iliev, p. 253 The latter awarded him a doctorate of law.Iliev, p. 253 An erudite, Stroiescu reportedly spoke all Slavic languages, German, French, English and Italian, in addition to his native Romanian. Upon graduation, he traveled throughout Europe, including in the Kingdom of Romania, and also visited the Western colonies in Africa.Constantin (2010), p. 240 This was a passion shared by his older brother Mihail, who was once shipwrecked in the Pacific, and later wrote memoirs of his adventures.Colesnic, pp. 192‚Äì193 Vasile was appointed a judge at the Hotin city tribunal in 1867,Basciani, p. 78 becoming colleagues with writer Alexandru H√¢jdeu. Following his father's death, he withdrew from the legal profession altogether, making Br√Ænzeni his main residence. There, he began his trade as a gentleman farmer, peasant educator, and amateur agronomist, while maintaining a lively interest in historical research. After receiving his inheritance, Stroescu owned 9,000 hectares (22,000 acres), but later came to purchase 16,000 more hectares (some 4,000 acres) of land, with several manors, ranches, and stables, making him one of the richest people in the region.Bolovan & Bolovan, p. 23 Many of his properties he auctioned off, using the money to finance his philanthropy, or divided between the peasant obshchiny, with Stroescu as a pioneer of cooperative farming and cooperative forestry. He personally verified his plowmen's techniques and corrected their mistakes. As noted by Br√Ænzeni native Ion Buzdugan, he was \\"modest and balanced\\", but also \\"ruthless with those who squandered his wealth.\\" Fellow activist Pan Halippa noted that Stroescu was a \\"real democrat\\" and \\"true Christian\\", who \\"never married and lived modestly.\\" \\"This man\\", Halippa claims, \\"used his great managerial competence to please those living on his estate. He [...] helped everyone own a proper home grange, acting a statesman ought to. [...] If only those ministers who call themselves democrats and socialists could know how the great Bessarabian Romanian Vasile Stroescu used to live!\\"Constantin & Negrei (2009), pp. 68‚Äì69 By 1918, Stroescu only had some 8,000 hectares left to his name, spread about between Trinca, BƒÉdragii Vechi, Dru»õa and ZƒÉbriceni.Clark, p. 296 Nationalist sponsor As noted by historian Iurie Colesnic, Stroescu and Nicolae »òtefan Casso stood among those boyars who reverted Russification or Moldovenism, \\"neutralizing the influence\\" of pro-imperial adversaries such as Alexander N. Krupensky.Colesnic, pp. 573, 576‚Äì577 Stroescu built of refurbished several schools in Bessarabia, founded hospitals in his native village and in BrƒÉtu»ôeni, and became ktitor of Bessarabian Orthodox churches in Trinca, PociumbƒÉu»õi, »òofr√Æncani, and ZƒÉicani. In 1899, he offered to sponsor state schools, provided that they be allowed to teach classes in Romanian. This proposal was simply disregarded by government. With the liberalization made possible by the Revolution of 1905, Stroescu began participating in conspiratorial meetings of the Romanian elite in Kishinev, exchanging ideas with Halippa, Nicolae Alexandri, Ion Incule»õ, Nicolae Bivol, Alexis Nour, Ion Pelivan, and Paul Gore, where they first discussed the prospect of Romania and Bessarabia uniting.Constantin & Negrei (2009), pp. 82‚Äì83, 85 As Pelivan notes, he and Emanuil Gavrili»õƒÉ tried to persuade Stroescu to finance a magazine for the Romanian-speaking populace, but the landowner \\"seemed rather skeptical\\".Constantin et al. (2012), p. 354 However, in 1906 he sponsored Halippa in setting up a democratic-and- nationalist newspaper, Basarabia, eventually shut down by the Russian authorities in March 1907.Constantin & Negrei (2009), pp. 14‚Äì15; Constantin et al. (2012), pp. 42‚Äì43, 354, 600‚Äì601. See also Rutkowski, p. 140 By 1910, Stroescu had expatriated himself to Switzerland, and was living in Davos Platz. His charity work continued to have a profound effect among the Romanian communities of Transylvania, in Austria-Hungary, where Stroescu notably founded the boarding house serving the Diocese of Arad, as well as \\"tens of churches, schools and hospitals\\". Although a patron of Romanian Orthodoxy, he was critical of the church's claim to have preserved Romanian identity, noting that its nationalist discourse was a recent \\"invention of the parsons, to emphasize their own merits\\".Rom., \\"Cultele √Æn Rom√¢nia\\", in Glasul MinoritƒÉ»õilor, Nr. 7‚Äì9/1925, p. 28 He saw Orthodoxy as equal to its rival Romanian Greek-Catholic Church, arguing that \\"a religious difference cannot divide us\\", since \\"Romanians of both religions behave one to the other as true Christians and therefore as brethren\\". As such, in 1910 Stroescu allied himself with the Greek Catholics to tackle the effects of Magyarization, donating 100,000 Kronen to the cultural fund in Blaj.Stan, pp. 160‚Äì161 Other estimates suggest that his sponsorship of schools, including Orthodox ones, ran at 950,000 Kronen in 1913‚Äî500,000 of these were channeled through Partenie Cosma,Ilie, pp. 253, 255. See also Andru»ô, pp. 589‚Äì590 and 200,000 more through the Archbishopric of Sibiu, while 100,000 went to the creation of a girls' school in Arad.Bolovan & Bolovan, p. 26. See also Stan, p. 161 His contribution also included a Stroescu Fund at ASTRA Society and various payments to the Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians.Galbur, p. 162. See also Andru»ô, p. 589 In Romanian-ruled Western Moldavia, he fitted primary schools from a special fund, which ran at 200,000 lei, and, in 1906‚Äì1908, put up 300,000 lei for the building of a Romanian People's Salvation Cathedral.Bolovan & Bolovan, p. 26; Constantin et al. (2012), p. 160 Stroescu's brother (and fellow philanthropist) Mihail Vasilievici In May 1910, as recognition of his activities, and in particular for his work with the Blaj foundations, Stroescu was elected an honorary member of the Romanian Academy. This appointment left him indifferent, as he considered his deeds \\"only natural\\". He declared himself \\"at my country's disposal, with all this mind God gave me, from all my heart and with my entire wealth\\".Galbur, p. 162 According to Halippa and Pelivan, his focus fell on Transylvania and elsewhere only because censorship and repression prevented him from openly financing nationalism in his native province.Constantin & Negrei (2009), p. 183; Constantin et al. (2012), pp. 77, 123 Another account is that he was felt called into action by the anti-Magyarization writings of Ioan Slavici.Bolovan & Bolovan, p. 24 Moreover, his philanthropic activity was preceded by that of his late brother Mihail, who, as early as 1882, had set up ten model schools in Romania-proper, after having failed to create a Romanian studies department at Novorossiya University.Constantin et al. (2012), pp. 111, 122, 159 Also noted for founding a school in Stolniceni, Mihail had set up a rural hospital at Bekir, eventually splitting his wealth between ASTRA, the Romanian vocational schools of Bra»ôov, and his tenant farmers.Constantin et al. (2012), pp. 122, 159, 263, 278. See also Andru»ô, pp. 588‚Äì589 The family's renewed contributions have led various authors to refer to Vasile as Transylvania or Bessarabia's \\"Maecenas\\".Andru»ô, p. 589; Bezviconi (1943), p. 163; Colesnic, p. 573; Constantin & Negrei (2009), pp. 14, 16, 87; Constantin et al. (2012), p. 513; Iliev, p. 255; SuveicƒÉ, pp. 72‚Äì73 Transylvanians such as Justinian Teculescu dedicated him verse of praise; others believed that he was not a real man, but a fictional character created by the Romanian state to hide its direct involvement in Austro-Hungarian affairs.Stan, p. 161 Stroescu also sponsored individual Bessarabians to pursue their education abroad, as he did with physician and fellow Romanian nationalist Elena Alistar,Basciani, p. 89 and founded an eponymous Stroescu Help Club for the Romanian Americans of Cleveland.Galbur, p. 161 Between June 1910 and August 1911, he paid for Nour to publish a Russian-language paper, Bessarabets,Ion Constantin, \\"Alexis Nour, agent al Ohranei\\", in Magazin Istoric, September 2011, p. 30. See also Constantin et al. (2012), p. 356 and, after 1913, financed the newspaper Cuv√¢nt Moldovenesc, published by Halippa and Alexandri,Ciobanu, p. 66; Constantin (2010), p. 216; Constantin & Negrei (2009), pp. 16, 151, 183, 290; Rutkowski, p. 140. See also Basciani, p. 78 also helping peasants with their subscriptions. By 1912, Stroescu was living in Lausanne, but still appeared incognito to celebrate the golden jubilee of Petru Maior Society in Budapest.\\"Vasile de Stroescu a participat incognito la serbƒÉrile jubiliare ale societƒÉ»õii 'Petru Maior'. DouƒÉsprezece mii de coroane societƒÉ»õii 'Petru Maior'\\", in Rom√¢nul (Arad), Nr. 93/1912, p. 3. See also Constantin et al. (2012), pp. 512‚Äì513 However, he was expressing his disenchantment with his Transylvanian colleagues. His letters to his fund's beneficiaries often included \\"drastic reprimands.\\" In early 1913, he published a piece in the newspaper Rom√¢nul of Arad, attacking Romanian banks for paying dividends higher than 5%, and their clients for accepting them; the difference, he argued, could go toward sponsoring culture. Responding to this \\"judicious and unusually categorical\\" critique, the economist Ion Mateiu suggested that the reduction demanded by Stroescu was needlessly abrupt.Ion Mateiu, \\"Soarta »ôcoalelor noastre. ConstatƒÉri »ôi propuneri\\", in LuceafƒÉrul, Nr. 9/1913, pp. 276‚Äì277 Stroescu, who donated 50,000 Kronen to settling disputes between ASTRA and the popular banks, and then to the creation of alternative credit unions,Dumitru »òandru, \\"Coopera»õia rom√¢nƒÉ de credit p√¢nƒÉ la Marea Unire\\", in Buletin »òtiin»õific, Vol. 16, 2007, pp. 87, 89‚Äì90 found sympathy with the writing team at LuceafƒÉrul, which basked in his critique of \\"our petty bourgeoisie [and] its plutocratic ideals\\".\\"√énsemnƒÉri. Articolul d-lui Stroescu\\", in LuceafƒÉrul, Nr. 9/1913, p. 304 Through ASTRA, he also distributed his brochure Statutele »ôi √ÆndrumƒÉrile pentru bƒÉncile poporale (\\"Statutes and Guiding for the People's Banks\\").B√¢rseanu & Simu, pp. 561‚Äì562 The Bihar County bankers objected to such initiatives, seeing Stroescu as an unfair competitor to their business.Andru»ô, p. 590 Revolution and union By 1914, Stroescu's relations with the Austro-Hungarian authorities were noticeably strained. His sponsoring of a Christmas 1913 folk party in Beiu»ô almost ended with the prosecution of its organizer, Nicolae Coroiu.Gabriel Moisa, \\"√éntre mica »ôi marea istorie. Nicolae Coroiu: un destin sub vremurile primului rƒÉzboi mondial\\", in Revista Crisia, Vol. 45, Issue 1, 2015, p. 153 The outbreak of World War I caught Stroescu on the Russian side, ending all his work in Transylvania; the government of Istv√°n Tisza listed him as a \\"public menace\\", suspected of wanting to incite a Romanian rebellion in Transylvania. He returned to Odessa in 1914, and managed to persuade the authorities to release his proteg√©e Alistar, who had been arrested for sedition.Constantin et al. (2012), pp. 168, 344, 608 In late 1916, Romania entered the war, siding with Russia against Austria-Hungary and the other Central Powers. Following the February Revolution, which inaugurated an episode of social rebellion and national emancipation throughout Russia, the Stroescus were targeted by Russian revolutionaries. Gheorghe's former manor in BƒÉlceana was ransacked by deserters from the Romanian Front, who burned down his manuscripts,Colesnic, p. 193 and so were other country homes owned by the family.Constantin et al. (2012), p. 375 The Br√¢nzeni estate was spared: the peasants there, having already set up a network for trafficking Romanian books into Bessarabia,Constantin et al. (2012), p. 165 also formed a self-defense unit which protected their shared wealth. Vasile was at Soroca, where he signed a manifesto for Bessarabian self-determination, officially backed by the zemstvo and the gentry assembly.Ciobanu, pp. 118‚Äì120 He then took part in the establishment of Bessarabia's own National Moldavian Party (PNM), formed on . This came only after protracted negotiations with a Transylvanian refugee, Onisifor Ghibu, who was perplexed that Bessarabians \\"hardly understood the importance of having a political party [...] that would militate for the national cause.\\" Stroescu held on to an apolitical stance, replying that \\"he was ready to give as much as he had, but only for cultural enterprises, because politics, he said, was a dirty activity.\\"Cristina Petrescu, \\"Contrasting/Conflicting Identities: Bessarabians, Romanians, Moldovans\\", in Bal√°zs Trencs√©ny, Drago»ô Petrescu, Cristina Petrescu, Constantin Iordachi, Zolt√°n K√°ntor (eds.), Nation-Building and Contested Identities: Romanian and Hungarian Case Studies, p. 169. Budapest & Ia»ôi: Regio Books & Polirom, 2001. At Kishinev in early 1917, he met the Transylvanian activist Hortensia Goga, who described him as \\"healthy and content, [...] seems not to be preoccupied by anything except his own person.\\"Mihai M. Drecin, \\"Russian Images and Impressions in the Correspondence Between the Refugee Hortensia Cosma-Goga and Octavian Goga (January‚ÄìApril 1917)\\", in Ioan Bolovan, Rudolf Gr√§f, Harald Heppner, Oana Mihaela TƒÉma»ô (eds.), World War I ‚Äì The Other Face of the War, p. 146. Cluj-Napoca: Romanian Academy Centre for Transylvanian Studies & Presa UniversitarƒÉ ClujeanƒÉ, 2016. Eventually, the PNM, representing the more right-wing and nationalist politicians in the Governorate, proposed Bessarabian autonomy and the creation of a national legislature, Sfatul »öƒÉrii.Basciani, pp. 78‚Äì79; Clark, pp. 131‚Äì134; Rutkowski, pp. 140‚Äì141 Stroescu, as the \\"Grand Old Man\\" of nationalism, was the PNM's honorary leader, with Paul Gore as the executive president and Halippa as secretary.Clark, p. 133. See also Basciani, p. 78; Ciobanu, pp. 69‚Äì70; Constantin (2010), p. 240; Constantin & Negrei (2009), pp. 16‚Äì17, 107; Rutkowski, p. 141 Later, he and Halippa attended the Soldiers' Congress in Odessa, which affirmed its support for \\"autonomous Bessarabia\\" and a federated Russian Republic. The uniformed procession paid him homage by parading in front of London Hotel, where he was staying.Constantin & Negrei (2009), pp. 86‚Äì87. See also Constantin et al. (2012), pp. 513‚Äì514 In June of the same year, as the gentry assembly formed a Society for Assisting Popular Education and the Study of National Customs, Stroescu became honorary chairman; Gore and Vladimir Hertza were its \\"active presidents\\".Colesnic, pp. 576‚Äì577 During the October Revolution and Russia's disintegration, Sfatul »öƒÉrii was established and Stroescu nominally stood in the regional election. At the time, Pelivan argues, Stroescu was \\"a great nationalist, but less of a democrat\\", and alienated from his constituents because \\"(since 1900) he lived mostly abroad.\\"Constantin et al. (2012), p. 352 As noted by Halippa, Stroescu and Hertza were trying to set up a distinct PNM for the boyars: \\"their action did not lead to much [...], although we revolutionaries never objected to them being elected to Sfatul »öƒÉrii [...], since we believed that all intellectual forces needed to be consulted in political matters\\".Constantin & Negrei (2009), p. 77 Historian Charles Upson Clark claims that he even served for a while as the legislature's president, during Bessarabia's brief existence as a nominally independent Moldavian Democratic Republic. However, Stroescu is known to have been seriously ill from September 1917 to the early months of 1919, leaving for England and France, and only championed the union of Bessarabia with Romania from afar. In March 1918, when Sfatul »öƒÉrii was visited by the Romanian Prime Minister Alexandru Marghiloman and voted in favor of union, Stroescu was in Paris. This was an uncertain period, with him in Allied territory while Romania capitulated to the Central Powers. At the time, Stroescu wrote his will, with Pelivan as his executor. It called for redistributing his land (much of it already taken over by the zemstvo), or, alternatively, donating it to the Romanian state; in exchange, he only demanded that peasants receive education in Romanian.Clark, pp. 296‚Äì297; Constantin et al. (2012), pp. 123, 160 As noted in 1927 by Clark, this document reflected the \\"comfortable old Russian patriarchal atmosphere\\", and was already outdated by the pace of \\"militant equalization\\"‚Äîalthough the dream of Romanian education was eventually fulfilled by the state itself, with its mandatory literacy programs.Clark, pp. 297‚Äì298 Assembly President and dissenter On September 1, 1918, returning to Paris, Stroescu joined Vasile Lucaciu and Ioan Cantacuzino in creating a National Romanian Action Committee for promoting the cause of Greater Romania in Allied countries. He later attached himself to Take Ionescu's National Committee for Romanian Unity. Following the November Armistice, Marghiloman was deposed and Romania, Bessarabia included, reentered the war. In December, this step ensured the Transylvanian union, with the new borders awaiting international recognition at the Paris Peace Conference. Throughout the following months, to Marghiloman's worry, Western powers seemed to favor placing Bessarabia, in whole or in part, under a League of Nations mandate.Marghiloman, pp. 322‚Äì323 In the national election of November 1919, Halippa enlisted Stroescu as a candidate for his Bessarabian Peasants' Party (P»öB), which resulted in him representing Orhei County in the Assembly of Deputies. Stroescu shared his ticket with historian Nicolae Iorga, although the latter was not a P»öB man.SuveicƒÉ, pp. 72‚Äì73 As recalled by Halippa, he ran simultaneously (and won) in three other electoral precincts‚ÄîHotin, Soroca, and BƒÉl»õi;Constantin & Negrei (2009), p. 68 and, according to other sources, also in Tighina County and LƒÉpu»ôna. On November 20,Iorga (1930), p. 268; Marghiloman, p. 414 as an homage to his work in promoting the Romanian cause,SuveicƒÉ, p. 73 Stroescu was also selected to preside upon Greater Romania's first parliamentary session, effectively as the Assembly's honorary President. Praised by Iorga for its composition and style,Iorga (1930), p. 268 the speech forewarned: \\"With a habit that has become second-nature, we scour the scene to find ways in which we may partake in the fruit of other people's labor. No, Gentlemen, this will no loger do! We must labor ourselves and commit to providing for ourselves. [...] In this life of ours we must maintain clean thoughts and clean hands.\\" This drew attention from Marghiloman's Progressive Conservatives, disgraced for their sympathy for the Central Powers. Marghiloman was drawn to Stroescu's anti-corruption hints, namely that \\"the new administrations of Bessarabia should keep their hands clean.\\"Marghiloman, pp. 414‚Äì415 Also on November 20, the Assembly Presidency went to Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, replaced on December 1 by Iorga; Stroescu still preserved his role as a dean of the Bessarabian caucus: on December 29, he presented for ratification the law on Romanian‚ÄìBessarabian unification, which was unanimously carried.Ioan Scurtu, \\"Activitatea primului Parlament al Rom√¢niei √éntregite\\", in Magazin Istoric, December 2019, pp. 19‚Äì22 Within months, however, he became a critic of the Romanian administration, speaking at the Assembly rostrum about the deteriorating situation of his native province and the state of siege it was placed under. On February 10, 1920, he took a stand against Ion Incule»õ, the P»öB Minister for Bessarabia, accusing him of tolerating \\"oppression in savage fashion\\", and concluding, to his colleagues' dismay, that \\"the situation was better under the old Russian r√©gime.\\"The Roumanian Occupation..., p. 190 This pitted him against the mainstream of his party, and also against Iorga. Despite shows of support from the Socialist Party benches and some P»öB deputies, Iorga suspended the session, accusing Stroescu of having \\"insult[ed] all the past and the future of the nation\\"; he was supported in this by Marghiloman.The Roumanian Occupation..., pp. 191, 193, 207 In his diary, Iorga summarized the incident: \\"Stroescu insulted from the rostrum this country as one of exploiters and awful clerks. I asked him to step down.\\"Iorga (1930), p. 333 Stroescu was also censured by Incule»õ, who dismissed his speech as \\"caf√© gossip\\" and a landowner's malcontent,The Roumanian Occupation..., p. 194 noting that the Bessarabian gentry as a whole reacted with \\"profound egotism\\" to the proposed land reform.Pierre Chasles, \\"La Succession de Russie\\", in Revue des Sciences Politiques, Vol. XLV, January‚ÄìMarch 1922, pp. 584‚Äì585 Nevertheless, Stroescu's position was endorsed by the daily AdevƒÉrul, which referred to Incule»õ as a \\"satrap\\" who simply ignored criticism, and called Iorga's moderating stance \\"absurd diplomacy\\". The paper also denounced Incule»õ's suggestion that those dissatisfied with his administration, Stroescu included, could opt to move to Soviet Russia.The Roumanian Occupation..., pp. 191‚Äì195 In March, according to the same Iorga, Stroescu voted \\"discreetly\\" against land reform, and then spoke out against the majority of supporters.Iorga (1930), p. 359 According to historians Sorina and Ioan Bolovan, \\"Stroescu kept apart from the demagoguery, careerism and pettiness of political intrigues.\\" In August 1923, partly as a protest against government arbitrariness, he participated in the founding of a League for Human Rights, with such members as Constantin Costa-Foru, Dem I. Dobrescu, Victor Eftimiu, Grigore Iunian, Ioan Pangal, Istrate Micescu, Ilie Moscovici, Constantin Titel Petrescu, Radu D. Rosetti, and »òtefan Voitec. He was elected its first president, with Costa-Foru serving as his secretary.Constantin Titel Petrescu, Socialismul √Æn Rom√¢nia. 1835 ‚Äì 6 septembrie 1940, pp. 382‚Äì386. Bucharest: Dacia Traiana, [n. y.] His criticism of government was followed with interest in White √©migr√© circles, where it was believed that a restored Russian monarchy should include Bessarabia. On their behalf, Alexander N. Krupensky suggested that Stroescu, \\"an honest man in spite of his accepting to be 'elected' by the Roumanian Government as one of the Bessarabian deputies\\", openly spoke on topics that Iorga and other establishment politicians wanted kept secret.The Roumanian Occupation..., p. 207 In Soviet Russia, which advanced its own claim to Bessarabia, propagandist Christian Rakovsky also used Stroescu's words against Romanian nationalist claims in his 1925 expos√©, Rumynia i Bessarabia.SuveicƒÉ, pp. 31‚Äì32 Death and legacy With his final donation of land, Stroescu renounced his manor in Br√Ænzeni to set up an agricultural and technical school.Constantin et al. (2012), p. 160 His prewar fund for ASTRA's public libraries, comprising 25,000 Kronen in 1914, was supplemented by the Transylvania's Directing Council and put to use in 1920.B√¢rseanu & Simu, pp. 560, 578 Before his death in Bucharest on April 14, 1926, Stroescu served in Senate, representing a Transylvanian constituency. His funeral service was held on April 17 at the Orthodox White Church on Calea Victoriei, and witnessed orations by priest Ioan Lupa»ô, who was also the incumbent Minister of Health, and by Patriarch Miron Cristea; the following day, a memorial service was held at Sibiu Cathedral.Bolovan & Bolovan, pp. 24‚Äì25, 26‚Äì27 Stroescu was awarded a state funeral at Bucharest's Sf√¢nta Vineri Cemetery.Bezviconi (1943), p. 163; Bolovan & Bolovan, pp. 26‚Äì27; Constantin (2010), p. 240 His tomb there was later decorated with a bust by the Moldavian Mihai Onofrei,Gheorghe G. Bezviconi, Necropola Capitalei, pp. 33, 260. Bucharest: Nicolae Iorga Institute of History, 1972 and a Bucharest street was renamed after him. The funeral itself was attended by his former colleague and rival Iorga. He noted delegates of all those who had been helped by the deceased‚Äîthe church, the Bessarabian Peasantists, and the nationalists‚Äîbut also that the establishment itself was absent. In his obituary, Iorga referred to Stroescu as a \\"great charitable man and generous benefactor\\".Nicolae Iorga, Oameni cari au fost, Vol. III, p. 215. Bucharest: Editura Funda»õiilor Regale, 1936 Other obituaries appeared during the following week. They included front- page editorials in Universul, Gazeta Transilvaniei, Telegraful Rom√¢n, Cuv√¢ntul Ardealului and (penned by Ghibu) Biruin»õa, with additional coverage in ASTRA's Societatea de M√¢ine.Bolovan & Bolovan, pp. 24‚Äì28 Stroescu's activity was first explored methodically in an essay by Alexandru Ciulcu, published by Via»õa Basarabiei magazine in 1940. Just months later, Bessarabia fell under a Soviet occupation, during which Ciulcu himself was killed by the NKVD.Colesnic, p. 377 Stroescu's memory was repressed in the resulting Moldavian SSR and, later, in Communist Romania. Nationalized, the Br√Ænzeni manor was turned into a psychiatric clinic. During the national communism of the 1960s, Halippa and the Bessarabian community in Bucharest tried to commemorate their former leader, but were reportedly prevented to do so by the authorities.Constantin & Negrei (2009), p. 251 However, in 1968, Halippa managed to invoke Stroescu and bring up the issue of his being \\"forgotten\\", with a formal address to the Academy.Constantin & Negrei (2009), pp. 296‚Äì297 Such work was partly continued in America by a nephew of Stroescu's, the journalist Gheorghe »òtefan Donev (1909‚Äì1993). The repressive trend was reversed following the Romanian Revolution of 1989: in 2013, a Palace of the Parliament hall was renamed in his honor, but, as historian Sever Dumitra»ôcu noted, no Transylvanian school once funded by his money ever accepted to acknowledge him in the same fashion.Iliev, p. 256 In independent Moldova, the lyceum in Br√Ænzeni took his name. A Moldovan Vasile Stroescu Foundation was created, a memorial plaque was put up in 1996 at Trinca, and efforts have been made to establish a memorial house in Br√Ænzeni.

The film mixes Direct Cinema documentary techniques and distancing devices similar to those employed by Jean-Luc Godard to tell the story of a young man's struggles to come to terms with his place in Quebec society and Quebec's place in Canada.The protagonist, a journalist played by , struggles with the question of whether to change society or accept it the way it is.

Origins He was the only son and heir of Miles Watson, 2nd Baron Manton of Compton Verney, Warwickshire and Plumpton Place, East Sussex, by his first wife Alethea Langdale, the younger of the two daughters and co-heireses of Colonel Philip Joseph Langdale, OBE, JP, DL, of Houghton Hall. In 1936Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.739 when Watson was 12 years of age, his parents were divorced and his father remarried two years later. Inheritance He inherited the barony of Manton on the death of his father in 1968. He was given Houghton Hall, the ancient seat of the extinct Barony of Langdale, by his maternal aunt Countess FitzWilliam (1898-1995) (n√©e Joyce Elizabeth Mary Langdale), eldest daughter and co- heiress of Lieutenant-Colonel Philip Joseph Langdale, who from 1956 was the wife of Thomas Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 10th Earl Fitzwilliam (1904‚Äì1979).Debrett's Peerage, 1968, pp.452, 453 With her husband's home, Wentworth Woodhouse, near Rotherham, Yorkshire, being the largest private residence in England, and with his second seat of Milton Hall, Peterborough, being the largest house in Cambridgeshire, also at her disposal, she may have felt little need to retain Houghton for her own use. Career He lived near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, the centre of English fox-hunting, until moving to the East Riding of Yorkshire to run Houghton Hall and its estate. He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Humberside in 1980. Military career He was educated at Eton College. In 1942 Watson joined the British Army and the next year was commissioned into the Life Guards. He saw service in Egypt, Germany, and Italy. He was promoted captain and retired in 1947. In 1951 he returned to the army and served in the 7th Queen's Own Hussars until 1956. He then served in the Leicestershire Yeomanry, in which he was appointed Adjutant. Horse racing From a young age, Watson was a successful jockey having won 130 times as an amateur. He won the Kim Muir Chase at the Cheltenham Festival in 1955 riding Gay Monarch. Following the example of his father, who had established a stud at Plumpton Place in Sussex, he became a successful owner and breeder of racehorses. In 1970 he was a director of Thirsk Racecourse in Yorkshire. From 1970 to 1975 he was a member of the Horserace Betting Levy Board, created to divert monies from bookmakers to the racing industry. In 1982 he was appointed Senior Steward of the Jockey Club, becoming effectively chief executive of the British horse racing, which term ended in 1985. As Senior Steward he led the campaign to allow betting shops to show televised races. Manton was a steward at several racecourses, Doncaster, Beverley and York Racecourse. He was a Tattersalls Committee member and between 1985 and 1991 he chaired the York Race Committee. In 1998 he entered a horse he bred and owned, Silver Stick, in the Horse & Hound Grand Military Gold Cup at Sandown Park. His son Miles was the jockey and won the race. When the Queen Mother presented Manton with his trophy he told her: \\"I saddled the horse; I bred the horse - and the jockey.\\"Daily Telegraph obituary, Lord Manton Fox-hunting He was Field Master of both the Belvoir and the Quorn Foxhounds and was a \\"well known\\" hunter in Leicestershire.

It was serialized in Shogakukan's Betsucomi magazine from May 2007 to October 2013. Shogakukan later collected the individual chapters into 16 bound volumes under the Flower Comics imprint. Viz Media licensed the series for an English- language release in North America. Plot When Teru's older brother died, she was left with little more than a cellphone containing the address of an elusive character called Daisy, whom Teru's brother said would watch over her. Daisy became Teru's pillar of strength over the next few years, as he sent her encouraging words through his phone, whether inspiring or mere chatter, as she faces her life alone. One afternoon, after bullies from the student council are mysteriously driven away, Teru accidentally breaks a school window, which results in her working for the grouchy, cruel school janitor named Tasuku Kurosaki. As Teru begins working for the unlikable school janitor, her feelings begin to surpass that of master and servant and she begins to question Daisy's true identity. Thus begins an unlikely friendship between a 16-year-old high school girl and a sly but smart 24-year-old man. As time goes by, the two become close and Teru falls for Kurosaki. What she doesn't know is that he has feelings for her too, but cannot return them for a number of reasons, the most important reason being that Kurosaki feels he caused her brother's death. Characters=Main Characters ; : A 16-year-old high school student, Teru is a strong-willed and kind girl who is alone after her older brother dies. She is left only with a cellphone that her brother gave her, connecting her to Daisy, who becomes Teru's source of encouragement and support through email messages. Despite never meeting him face-to-face, Teru has absolute trust in him (although she doesn't have romantic feelings for him). When she accidentally breaks a window, Teru is forced to become the \\"servant\\" of the school janitor, Tasuku Kurosaki, to pay it off. As the manga progresses, Teru's once negative feelings towards Kurosaki grow into something more romantic. However, she becomes suspicious that Kurosaki is, in fact, Daisy, and that the phone her brother left her might be more than it appears. ; : A 24-year-old young man working as the school janitor. Kurosaki is often depicted smoking his favorite brand Philip Morris, drinking, and participating in violent acts. Despite his unpleasant attitude, he cares deeply for Teru, acting toward her with genuine kindness, and is extremely protective of her. Teru is initially unaware that Kurosaki is also Daisy, a computer hacker who worked with her brother, Souichirou, and has been entrusted with looking after her. He is described by Teru's friends to be very attractive, though he does not generally display his emotions. Much to his chagrin, he is often jokingly described as a pervert and a lolicon by his friends, as it is established among his closest companions that he has strong romantic feelings for Teru. Kurosaki has made it his mission to care for Teru on the request of his dying friend, Souichirou, though recently he has chosen to protect her as his true self, as well. Despite his strong feelings for her, Kurosaki believes that he has no right to love Teru as he is \\"the one that led her brother to his death.\\" Throughout the manga, he struggles between his feelings towards her and his own conflicting memories regarding his complicated past as a hacker. Supporting characters ; Master : is the manager of Ohanabatake, a Western-style tea house, often seen wearing a bandana and apron. Both Kurosaki, Riko, and a number of characters refer to him as \\"Master\\" (\\"Masutaa\\" as a play on words). Despite his cordial demeanor and tendency to tease Kurosaki about his relationship with Teru, the Master can be surprisingly frightening; Kurosaki admits that the Master is far scarier than he is. The Master is fully aware of Kurosaki's activities as Daisy and has watched over Kurosaki, even before either of them became acquainted with Souichirou Kurebayashi. ; : Riko Onizuka was a member of the design team that Teru's brother led, as well as his girlfriend. As a result, she regards Teru as a younger sister and they live together as housemates. Riko is friends with Kurosaki and often subtly serves as his adviser on his situation with Teru, frequently teasing him or acting violently toward him if she thinks he has acted inappropriately towards Teru. She is also the school counselor at Teru's high school. Riko is 30-years-old. ; : Kiyoshi is Teru's best friend and a classmate, as well as a scholarship student. He attempted to find out more about why Teru was left so impoverished after her brother's death, despite Souichirou's reputation as a brilliant engineer. However, he ended up endangering both himself and Teru, until he is saved by Kurosaki. An intelligent boy who is able to exercise discretion, the Master reveals to Kiyoshi the true identity of Daisy as a gesture of trust. Afterwards, Kurosaki employs Kiyoshi as a second \\"servant\\" and another set of eyes to protect Teru, though Kiyoshi does not hesitate to poke fun at Kurosaki's affection for Teru. ; : The Chairman of Teru and Kurosaki's high school, Andou is a former colleague of Daisy and Teru's brother. He initially appears as the substitute janitor for Kurosaki. While he appears as a comical character who often appears from odd, small, and dark places, such as vents and garbage cans, and enjoys being beaten up, Andou is serious whenever matters concerning Daisy arise and acts as the group's leader during investigations. His nickname, Andy, came from Souichirou. ; : The Student Council President, an attractive girl who leads the student council to bully scholarship students like Teru and Kiyoshi and privatize school facilities. She has a tendency to enter bad relationships with unsavory men. Thanks to Teru's kindness, she gradually stops bullying and entering bad relationships. Though Rena does not admit it, Teru becomes one of her first true friends, and she indirectly tries to help Teru develop her relationship with Kurosaki. It is hinted that she later has feelings for Kiyoshi. ; : One of Teru's classmates and friends, Haruka acts as the leader of sorts in Teru's group of friends and encourages Teru's relationship with Kurosaki. She is the first friend that Teru confides in with her knowledge that she is aware that Kurosaki and Daisy are the same person. Haruka is frequently the first to come to Teru's defense at school, often leading their other friends to follow suit. She is a member of the school's art club, track team, and ghost club. ; : One of Daisy's former co-workers, described as persistent, but not terribly cunning. He comes to Teru's school as the new PC instructor and administrator for information management, but in truth hopes to get close to Teru to obtain her cellphone, believing it contains unreleased software Souchirou had been designing before his death. While his first attempt is thwarted by Kurosaki, Takeda chooses to stop harassing Teru because of her resolve and kindness after his second attempt. He subsequently becomes an infrequent ally to Daisy. Others ; : Souichirou Kurebayashi is the deceased brother of Teru Kurebayashi. Respected and admired as a very talented computer engineer, he led a team of engineers that included Tasuku Kurosaki and Riko Onizuka. Little is known about him, though he has been alternately shown as comically affectionate towards his sister and those he cares about, to being serious and empathetic. Before his death, Souichirou supposedly developed software that was to sell for a very high price but mysteriously disappeared. He forced the role of Daisy onto his friend Kurosaki. It is eventually revealed that Souichirou died of stomach cancer; instead of receiving treatment, Souichirou had invested his remaining time into solving the virus code Kurosaki had been forced to reproduce in order to save Kurosaki. In turn, Kurosaki is heavily burdened with the belief that he indirectly caused his friend's death. ; : The former information technology teacher and the system administrator of the school's information network. He was involved in a relationship with Rena and was an adviser to the Student Council. However, he used his position to embezzle funds from the school's budget until Teru solicits Daisy's help in order to expose Arai's corruption. Arai is fired soon afterward but is forced to become a pawn in a series of illegal activities targeting Daisy. Out of concern for Rena's safety, he approaches Teru to disclose information that would expose the organization's coercion. ; : Initially introduced as the attractive school nurse, Mori appears to be an air-headed woman who often makes blunt, thinly- veiled insults against Teru. However, Kurosaki gradually becomes suspicious of what Mori is capable of when she tries to use Teru to expose Daisy. In reality, she is actually the true culprit behind various attacks on Teru and Kurosaki, all to obtain information regarding a dangerous project that Kurosaki had been responsible for creating. Because she had been hired by Andou's predecessor as chairman of the school, her background is unknown. When her true identity is exposed, she disappears from the school and remains at large. ; : A mysterious and eerie boy with an uncanny passing resemblance to Teru's older brother, Souichirou, and a wide grin that makes him appear maniacal. To conceal his appearance, he wears a hoodie and he usually carries a yo-yo around. His behavior is erratic and seemingly remorseless, though he is exceptionally attached and affectionate towards Chiharu Mori, whom he works with as an accomplice. Though he is later identified as a gifted hacker, Akira is a very poor operative due to his childish emotional state resulting from the special treatment he received until that point. Akira displays a vindictive interest in Teru and enjoys hurting her to try and upset Kurosaki, whom he blames for unknown reasons relating to his past. It is later revealed that he had been working for a man named \\"Antler\\" in order to obtain M's Testament. ; : Professor Hideo Midorikawa is a colleague of Souichirou Kurebayashi. He is known to be a good father figure to Souichiro, but he is also said to be the cause of the death of Kurosaki's father when he exposed him as a spy. ; : Father of Kurosaki. He also worked with Souichiro and Professor Midorikawa. After being accused of being a spy against the company they worked for, he later died in suspicious circumstances. After witnessing his death, Kurosaki vowed he would take vengeance, which made him create the virus Daisy, thus earning him the same nickname. ; Teru's friends : Teru's other friends include a helmet-hair girl named and buck-teeth boy named who like each other, as well as an overweight boy named , and a girl who pulls her bangs back and wears her hair in a ponytail named . A comical group who support one another, they look to Teru as their leader and are very loyal to her and to each other.

The first Conference took place in Manchester in 1903.\\"A history of the NEEC Conference 1902 -1992\\" Professor Peter Osgood, Leeds University Press The event provided an opportunity for senior decision makers in education, Children‚Äôs Services, the public sector, associated agencies and organisations to meet and consider the latest thinking and legislation affecting children and young people. In recent years the scope of the conference had expanded to encompass the broader children‚Äôs services agenda. Despite the conference name, delegates attended from across the UK and beyond. In recent years the conference took place outside of the North of England, including Belfast and Cardiff. In 2015 the conference was to be hosted in Manchester between 14‚Äì16 January but was cancelled and has not been held since. Delegates Within recent years the focus of the conference had expanded. Whilst still having education at its core, a broader children‚Äôs agenda was embraced. Attendees included Directors of Education, key elected members, headteachers, school governors, those engaged in research in Higher Education and partners from Health, Police and Voluntary Sector organisations. Speakers The conference attracted high-profile speakers and notably the appropriate Secretary of State. This has included in recent years Ed Balls, Ruth Kelly, David Miliband, David Blunkett and Estelle Morris. The conference was often used as a platform to launch or 'sound out' changes in policy or legislation. Hosting authorities often worked in collaboration with local universities and colleges to tap into national and international expertise and research. Venues Historically the Conference has taken place each January and has alternated in venue between the east and west of the Pennines. On occasion however, the Conference has been held outside the North of England. In 2004 the NEEC was held in Northern Ireland in Belfast and in 2008, the NEEC paid its first visit to Wales and Cardiff. In January 2014 the last conference was held in Nottingham. Development Reflecting changes in recent years in the delivery of services to children, young people and families the conference focus had begun to reflect the wider children‚Äôs agenda encapsulated in Every Child Matters: Change for Children.\\"Every Child Matters Agenda\\" Labour Government Paper enshrining the Children Act 2004 (retrieved 31 July 2010) Whilst the conference continued to provide high-profile speakers with an education focus, it had recently included speakers from other areas of the children‚Äôs workforce such as health, the police, business and the Third Sector. However the event, which generations of education policymakers viewed as a key moment of the year, now appears to be a thing of the past and by the time Michael Gove took over as education secretary in 2010, it was an event he was quite happy to miss, choosing to make major announcements elsewhere. No minister was due to appear in 2015. Governance The NEEC operated under the governance formed by its membership as part of the North of England Education Conference Association. This is defined as \\"Those English Local Authorities within the Government Office areas for the North West, the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber, and also the higher education institutions lying in this area\\". Representatives from the host authority, their predecessor and the following years host were represented in the governance. Involvement of children and young people A strong feature of the conference is the involvement of children and young people. Traditionally involved in artistic, musical and dramatic performance they had begun to play a wider role in the content of the programme. In January 2012 Blackpool had a young person co- preside over the conference for the first time along with President, Ann Widdecombe. In Nottingham in 2014 there was a separate Youth Conference running alongside the main event run by young people from the eight Core Cities. History of the Conference In 1902, having seen the success of a conference for science teachers in London, JH Reynolds, Manchester City Council's Director of Technical Instruction, decided to replicate the conference in his home town. The conference, also with a science theme, was arranged for 2 and 3 January 1903 and attended by 3,200 teachers, lecturers, inspectors and local government employees.\\"Best wishes to our friend in the North\\" Times Educational Supplement, 3 January 2003, Alison Brace - Article on the History of the NEEC on its 100th anniversary (retrieved 31 July 2010) Built on this success the conference widened the agenda to cover all areas of the curriculum. With short input from a range of professionals the, conference has remained true to the original template and remained a fixture in the first week of the year. In 1924 the political dimension was added and the Secretary of the State of the day has usually been in attendance ever since, the conference often serving as a platform for announcement to changes in legislation or educational approaches.

It processes film, slides and certain movie films, and offers photo services. Dwayne's Photo was the last Kodak certified Kodachrome processing facility in the world, which stopped accepting rolls of Kodachrome on December 30, 2010, citing Kodak's discontinuation of the necessary developing chemicals.  History  The company was founded in 1956 by Dwayne Steinle as a small film processing facility, but it quickly expanded to become one of the leading photo processors in the United States. When the use of 8 mm film and its successor Super 8 declined rapidly in the 1980s, most facilities closed down. Dwayne's, and some other labs, process a variety of film types, like 126 film, that are no longer manufactured. Between 2000 and 2010, the business was affected by the decline in income because of widespread migration to digital photography, and by 2010 it had reduced its staffing levels from 200 to about 60. By that date, digital sales accounted for half the company's revenue. Kodachrome Dwayne's Photo announced that it would continue processing Kodachrome film, which was no longer manufactured by Kodak, until the end of December 2010. The last roll was processed on January 18, 2011. On July 14, 2010, Dwayne's announced that the final roll of Kodachrome manufactured by Kodak was developed for Steve McCurry. The 36 slides will be housed at George Eastman House in Rochester, New York. The last roll of Kodachrome film to be developed was exposed by owner Dwayne Steinle with the last exposed frame being a group shot of the Dwayne's Photo employees. Based upon the 2010 New York Times article about this event, in 2017 Mark Raso directed the film Kodachrome. The last days of Kodachrome color processing by Dwayne‚Äôs Photo are depicted in the book Kodachrome ‚Äì End of the Run: Photographs from the Final Batches, edited by Bill Barrett and Susan Hacker Stang. The book includes a year of pictures shot by Webster University photography students on more than 100 rolls of Kodachrome film and processed by Dwayne's on the last day it was processing it, January 18, 2011, before processing chemicals were used up.Kodachrome ‚Äì End of the Run: Photographs from the Final Batches (St. Louis, Webster University Press, 2011), pages 2-10.

Known as Hampstead Mexico Road, the state highway runs from MD 27 in Mexico east to MD 30 Business in Hampstead. In conjunction with MD 27, MD 482 connects Westminster with Hampstead. The state highway was constructed at both ends in the early 1930s; the middle section was completed in the late 1940s. MD 482 was relocated in Mexico around 1960 and in Hampstead in 2009, the latter to connect with the new alignment of MD 30. Route description View west along MD 482 in Hampstead MD 482 begins at an intersection with MD 27 (Manchester Road) in Mexico. The roadway continues west as Guadelupe Drive into the residential community of New Mexico. In Mexico, MD 482 intersects Old Manchester Road, which is unsigned MD 852G, and Leisters Church Road, which heads west as unsigned MD 849. The state highway heads east as a two-lane undivided road through farmland that traverses Aspen Run and the East Branch of the North Branch of the Patapsco River. Just after entering the town of Hampstead, MD 482 passes northwest of a park and ride lot and meets MD 30 (Hampstead Bypass) at a roundabout. The state highway passes North Carroll High School and crosses over CSX's Hanover Subdivision before reaching its eastern terminus at MD 30 Business (Main Street). The roadway continues east as municipally-maintained Fairmount Road. MD 482 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from MD 27 to MD 849 in Mexico.

MD 482 proper was constructed from MD 87 east to near Brodbeck Road and from MD 30 in Hampstead west to east of the East Branch of the North Branch of the Patapsco River by 1933. The eastern section of the state highway was extended west over the East Branch in 1936. The two sections of MD 482 were united when the middle section was improved in 1947. After MD 87 was removed from the state highway system in 1956, MD 482 was extended west to MD 31 along Leisters Church Road. The state highway was relocated to its present alignment west of Leisters Church Road in 1960 concurrent with the relocation of MD 31 between Westminster and Manchester; the old alignment became MD 849.

It lies 80 km north west of Jepara, Central Java in the Java Sea. The national park was formally declared as Marine Protection Area in 2001. Based on popular local myth, this archipelago was discovered by Sunan Nyamplungan, the nephew of Sunan Kudus who is one of the Wali Sanga. Karimun Java is also a tourist attraction popular for its white sandy beach, pristine coral reefs, challenging treks through the hills, the pilgrimage to Sunan Nyamplungan Cemetery, and the customs and traditions of the Karimunjava community. History Following a local legend, Karimun means not obvious, because in clear weather Karimunjawa can be seen from the coast of mainland Java, but still not clearly. Karimunjawa was originally settled by Sunan Nyamplungan, the son of Sunan Muria, one of the Muslim Saints (Sunan) who introduced Islam to Java. Karimunjawa is more famous than Bali (who was only a base for pirates for long) since centuries ... The island have been known by navigators worldwide as a haven on the trade roads through the java sea to Borneo or Spices Islands and can be found under different names (Tortuga, Chirimao, Carimon jawa ... ) on all Antique portulans and maps of the area. Historical Sources relate the discovery of the Archipelago by Chinese Army sent by emperor Kubhilai Khan in 1293 (they named it CHI-LI-MEN) , followed by Ottoman Turkish navigators in 1403, Portuguese, Dutch, French (Bouguinville ... ), English etc ... Recent Archeological researches found porcelains from the Ming dynasty. Many Yachtmen continue the tradition and stop now in Karimunjawa on their way from Australia to Thailand or China sea or back ... Geography The Crimon Java archipelago lies from 5¬∞49‚Äô - 5¬∞57‚Äô South Latitude and 110¬∞04' - 110¬∞40' East Longitude in the Java Sea, north of Java. It is about 120 km from Semarang, the capital of Central Java Province; and about 80 km from the nearest town Jepara. Comprising 27 islands, the Karimunjawa subdistrict is divided into three villages, namely Karimunjawa, Kemujan and Parang. The archipelago is under the administration of Jepara Regency, Central Java Province. The geological formation in the archipelago is mostly dominated by quartz sandstone, gravel, mud, and clay.Geological map of Central Java Province (1976) The topography of Karimunjawa Marine National Park is a wave of low land, with elevation ranging from 0‚Äì506 meters above sea level. Gajah hill is the Park‚Äôs highest point. Temperatures range from 30-31 ¬∞C. The biggest island in the archipelago is Karimunjawa Island. Towns or villages are located in Karimunjava, Kemujan, Nyamuk, Parang, and Genting Island. The other islands are uninhabited. Ecosystem Many researchers have been attracted to the marine biodiversity and pristine forest as well as the uniqueness of the Karimunjawa archipelago. During the Dutch colonial era, many Dutch botanists such as Teijsmann (1854), Koorders (1886), Schlechter (1910) and Dammerman (1926) came to the Karimunjawa archipelago. Karimunjawa has five types of ecosystems: coral reef, seagrass and seaweed, mangrove forest, coastal forest and low land tropical rainforest. Fresh water is confined to a few small wells and forest streams in the islands. The coral reefs Karimunjawa's coral reefs are made up of fringing reefs, barrier reefs and several patch reefs. They have an extraordinary wealth of species: 51 genera with more than 90 species of coral biota and 242 species of ornamental fish. Two protected biota species, black coral (Antiphates sp.) and organ pipe coral (Tubipora musica), can be found here. Other protected sea biota include the hornet helmet (Cassis cornuta), triton trumpet (Charonia tritonis), chambered nautilus, green shell (Turbo marmoratus), and six species of clam. Around Kemujan island, the wreck of the Panamanian ship Indono, which sank to the sea bed in 1955, is now a habitat of coral fish and is a popular site for wreck diving. The seagrasses and seaweeds There are 10 genera of seagrass mostly dominated by Enhalus and Thalassia. The seaweed species are grouped into three divisions: Chlorophyta (Coulerpa and Halimeda), Phaeophyta (Padina, Sargassum and Turbinaria) and Rhodophyta (Euchema, Glacillaria, Gelidinium, Hypne and Acanthopora). The forests The endemic dewadaru tree whose wood is used by the locals to make various talisman objects. A total of 300 ha of mangrove forest covers the national park, and is the habitat for 13 genera and 32 species of mangroves, such as the Rhizophora mucronata. The lowland tropical forest covers an area of 1,285.50 ha. It provides habitat to a number of endemic species including the mythical dewadaru tree (Fagraea elliptica), setigi (Pemphis acidula) and kalimasada (Cordia subcordata). The local people use these trees as raw material for souvenir handicrafts such as tasbih, kris, or staffs. It is generally believed that the wood of the endemic dewadaru tree has a legendary power of curing diseases or snake bite wounds, protecting house from thieves, or prolonging life. Recently, the population of these three tree species has deteriorated because of the increased extraction. There are about forty different bird species in the island, including the green imperial-pigeon, (Ducula aenea), yellow-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus goiavier) and red-breasted parakeet (Psittacula alexandri). Some migratory birds are also found in this area, such as the common sandpiper and whimbrel. The lowland tropical rain forest is the natural habitat of the rare white-bellied sea eagle. The latest expedition report of the Indonesian Science Institute reveals that there are two endemic butterfly species, and these are the Euploea crameri karimodjawensis and the Idea leuconoe karimodjawensis. The diversity of terrestrial animals of this park is not as high in terms of numbers as that of the aquatic animals. However, it is still possible to see Javan rusa deer (Cervus timorensis), Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica), and the Malayan pit viper (Calloselasma rhodostoma). Several species of turtles lay their eggs on the islands, e.g. hawksbill turtle and green turtle. Conservation Karimunjawa Marine National Park is one of the six marine national parks in Indonesia, and was among the first areas recognised as being important for conservation and marine biodiversity protection. It was formally declared a Strict Natural Reserve in 1986 and has since been declared one of the priority areas for the conservation of marine biodiversity in Southeast Asia.World Bank, 1992 Then in 1999, the Ministry of Forestry established Karimunjawa archipelago as the Karimunjawa Marine National Park covering 111,625 ha.SK No. 185/Kpts-II/1997 In 2001, an area of 110,117.30 ha was declared as Marine Protection Area (MPA).SK No. 74/Kpts-II/2001 Based on the functions, Karimunjawa National Park was divided into four zones: *Sanctuary Zone (1,299 ha): A no-take zone consisting of Burung and Geleang Islands. Research and education is permitted. *Wilderness Zone (7,801 ha): Research is permitted and tourist activity is limited. It consists of Krakal Besar, Krakal Kecil, Menyawakan, Cemara Besar, Cemara Kecil, Bengkoang and part of Karimunjawa and Kemujan islands. *Utilization Zone (4,431 ha): Consists Menjangan Besar, Menjangan Kecil, Kembang, Kembar, Karang Katang, Karang Kapal, Parang, Karimunjawa and Kemujan. *Buffer Zone (98,093.5 ha): Comprises Karimunjawa, Kemujan, Parang, and Nyamuk. These islands are inhabited. Due to the dynamic process of management, recent degradation and the degree of destruction, the current zones are no longer effective for management. The Karimunjawa National Park is now proposing a new zone management through a project that began in 2002 and is still ongoing. People The population of Karimunjawa District is 8,842,Karimunjawa National Park Statistics, 2002 most of whom are fishermen. Karimunjawa community consists of many ethnic groups such as Javanese, Madurese, Bugis, Mandar, Bajak, and Luwu. The Javanese people are popularly known for their agricultural activity and their production of household utensils. The Bugis are known for their seafaring activities, and naturally they are associated with fishermen. The Madurese are known for their salted fish production. They live in harmony and have created a new behaviour and tradition. Culture and legends The legend of Karimunjava is related to Sunan Nyamplungan story. Sunan Nyamplungan was born Amir Hasan, the son of Sunan Muria, one of the Wali Sanga. He was very spoiled by his mother, and is a disobedient child. By his father, he was entrusted to his uncle, Sunan Kudus. After some time being under Sunan Kudus's upbringing, he became an obedient young man. He was sent back to his parent, only to turn into a disobedient person again. Furious of his constant disobedience, Sunan Muria strove to inculcate in him a certain hard lesson. So one day Sunan Muria drove his son away from home with the warning that he was not to set foot on Java again. Not willing to disobey his father again, he prepared himself for the journey. In sadness, the son left Mount Muria where they dwelt and moved on to the open seas to the north. He sailed on a boat for many days through stormy weather and amidst huge waves, not really knowing his destination and perhaps with little will to survive. Then one day, his boat landed on the shores of a small, uninhabited island. Meanwhile, from the peak of Mount Muria in Java, the boy's father was secretly watching over his son clairvoyantly. But for some reason his vision was vague and unclear, and thus lost track of the whereabouts of the boy on that island. In the old Javanese language, the word \\"vague\\" is translated as kerimun. Thus the island became known as \\"Karimun- java.\\" The boy continued his journey inland bearing two wooden staffs as walking sticks to assist his journey. He retrieved these from the shore. These two short poles wounded him while his boat was capsized to shore by the sheer power of the waves. In the middle of the forest he poked the two staffs to the ground and started to rest from the tiresome journey. Miraculously, in that very instant the two staffs grew into magnificent trees. In awe of the incident, he named them \\"Dewadaru\\" (also known as Nyamplung tree). In the present day, the place where he rested now stands the village of Nyamplungan. In other version of the story, Amir Hasan was accompanied by two guards and two seeds of Nyamplung fruit with him during his journey. He also brought a mustaka (part of the top of mosque) which is now still residing in complex of Sunan Nyamplungan grave. The place where Amir Hasan resided was crowded with Nyamplung tree. The Dewadaru or Nyamplung tree is still regarded as sacred in the Karimunjawa archipelago. There are numerous strange stories related to the magical Dewadaru tree or its wood. To the local inhabitants these are no longer a matter of belief but knowledge and conviction gained from day to day experience. Being sacred, the Dewadaru is used only for devotional and protective purposes. One hardly finds the villagers using this wood for the fashioning of furniture or as a building material; and only the courageous would use it in their spiritual activities. The trees are not too numerous on the islands nowadays and therefore they are forcefully preserved. The Dewadaru is esteemed highly for their traditional and cultural value, and regarded as the totem guardians of the island. Because the occult power of the Dewadaru is well known, many disrespectful outsiders plunder the wood seeking to possess and misuse the power within it for egoic purposes. But it is also believed that Sunan Nyamplungan, the guardian of the island, or his proxy, plays a role in protecting the place from pilferers. Some say that the Adept sometimes appear as a gigantic bat to those who carry-out their negative intentions. In 1992, the faculty of biology of the University of Gajah Mada conducted some research on the Dewadaru and the report of their analysis states that this tree is quite rare and not easily propagated. There are two species to be found in the Karimunjava islands: the first is Baccaurea sumatrana from the family Euphorbiaceae; the second is Fagraea elliptica from the family Loganiaceae. The Dewadaru is supposed to be found solely in the Karimunjava islands. Although almost unheard of, there is at least one Dewadaru tree to be found in Java in the area of Mt. Kawi in the region of Malang, East Java. Strangely enough, those living in this area sanctify the leaves rather than the wood. Tourism The archipelago is accessible via flights from Surabaya to Dewandaru Airport in Kemujan Island. There is also a regular ferry and fast boat between Jepara or Kendal (near Semarang) ports to Karimunjawa island. Menjangan Kecil, Menjangan Besar, Tanjung Gelam, Legon Lele, Genting, Kembar, Parang, Cemara and Krakal Islands are popular marine tourism destinations (sailing, surfing, water skiing, swimming, white sand beaches, diving), camping, cultural visits, deer and bird observation. The Bengkoang and Kemujan Islands are a camping site and a site for the Panamanian ship Indono wreck diving. The hills of Bukit Bendera, Bukit Gajah and Legon Goprak are used as tracking and marine tours. There are many homestays or guests houses in Karimunjawa. There is one Boutique resort close to the village and a luxury resort on its own island.

Some sources include Thomas Johnson and Levi Hansly as founding members,Horace Clarence Boyer.

K. McNeil), Routledge Press, 2005, p. 174. likewise, eventual leader Joseph Williams is identified as a founding member in some sources, and others claiming he joined as much as six years later. In 1937 the group added Lonnie Smith, who later became father to keyboardist Lonnie Liston Smith. The group recorded for Decca Records in 1943 and toured in the postwar years, performing at such high-profile events as the 1944 National Baptist Convention, to an audience of 40,000; the funeral ceremony for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1945; and the wedding ceremony of gospel star Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Russell Morrison, an event recorded for a live album to which the group contributed four songs. During this period the group recorded for different labels, including Chicago company Religious Recording, Coleman, and MGM. As of the early 1950s, they signed with Philadelphia's Gotham Records, where they recorded some 40 songs before moving on in 1957 to Chicago's Vee-Jay Records, where they experienced their greatest popularity. Smith retired in 1962, and following a period in the late 1960s of recording for various labels in various membership configurations, the group was essentially semi-retired for the ensuing decades. Radio The Harmonizing Four began singing on WRNL, in Richmond, in 1943, soon after recording eight songs for Decca in New York City. Described as \\"the area's top quartet,\\" the group \\"would have Sunday breakfast with Richmond for nearly two decades, sponsored by People's Furniture.\\" The group would undergo many changes in lineup over the years, with Joseph Williams, Thomas Johnson and Lonnie Smith remaining at the core. In 1958, the final lineup was achieved with the addition of Ellis Johnson, the son and namesake of Thomas Johnson, as bass singer. The group entered a period of high album output during this period, beginning with \\"God Will Take Care of You\\" and releasing over two dozen albums in this era. As they collaborated on these albums, they balanced traditional gospel songs with original music and, on a number of albums, Joseph Williams would have one spoken track to accompany a traditional gospel song. Examples of these are \\"House, Picture and Prayer\\" from \\"Shine On Me\\" (1967), \\"Come Ye, Disconsolate\\" from \\"40 Years Singing Gospel\\" (1968), \\"Tommie, Lonnie and Me\\" from \\"Tommie, Lonnie and Me\\" (1968) and \\"End of My Journey\\" from \\"One God\\" (1972). The group would continue until the deaths of Joseph Williams in 1988, Ellis Johnson in 1993, Lonnie Smith in 1995 and finally Thomas Johnson in 2003.

Process AEO is based on faunal overlap and stratigraphic superposition to derive a best-fit sequence of first and last appearance events. Step 1 The first step is to translate patterns of overlap and superposition into pairwise first-before- last statements. The wolf species Canis edwardii and Canis armbrusteri are used as example taxa for the following patterns. Each statement means C. edwardii, for example, must have first appeared before C. armbusteri last appeared. This is true whenever either (1) C. edwardii and C. armbrusteri have been found together in at least one nontime-averaged fossil collection, or (2) C. edwardii is found lower in at least one lithostratigraphic section than C. armbrusteri. Step 2 A multivariate ordination algorithm is applied to derive a first-pass, hypothesized sequence of first and last appearances. The minimal constraint on this sequence is that if there is an observed, real- world C. edwardii before C. armbrusteri statement for any pair of taxa, the hypothesized event sequence must replicate it. Then, the program shuffles the events using a maximum likelihood criterion. The criterion basically seeks to pull apart as many hypothesized age range overlaps as possible, especially if they involve common taxa. Taxa are defined as \\"common\\" if they are known to overlap with a large fraction of the taxa with which they are implied to overlap. Step 3 Once the relative event sequence has been established, it is converted into numerical time with a nonlinear interpolation algorithm that compares event sequence positions and geochronological age estimates for collections that have them. The calibration only uses: *40Argon/39Argon dates *Uranium-thorium dates for some Pleistocene collections *Paleomagnetic dates that derive from unambiguous, narrow correlations inferred using nonfaunal tie points such as the position in the section of the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary, Paleocene-Eocene boundary, or Recent NALMA vs. AEO The North American land mammal ages procedure uses subjective opinions by published sources and/or authors, citing authors such as Michael O. Woodburne, Robert W. Wilson, and J. David Archibald.

These photographs regularly appear in automobile magazines. As a result of his success, a number of photographers have followed his example. Because of this, a number of major car manufacturers developed their own testing facilities to prevent people from taking photographs of their secretive prototypes and pre-production cars. His nickname in the industry amongst others is Handy Hans, carparazzo, car spy, prototype hunter and is widely regarded as a pioneer of the car spy photography and the best known of them all. Since his retirement in 2008, he continued to run his photo syndication company. Biography Lehmann was born in the former East Germany. At a young age, his family moved to Wolfsburg where he developed his interest for cars. He later moved to Hamburg in the 1960s, where he worked as a photographer for a news agency and freelanced for daily newspapers. In his break, he frequently visited his parents, usually taking his camera along. Whilst there in 1963, at the nearby Volkswagen factory, he used a 300mm lens to take some photographs of an unusual looking car near the factory. His employer became uneasy about the photographs, and after declining them, Lehmann sold them to the tabloid newspaper Bild for a healthy sum of money. The prototype in question turned out to be a proposed replacement for the Volkswagen Beetle. He continued to combine his photojournalism with his stint as a spy photographer. Secrecy Despite having access to or having their own proving grounds, prior to a launch, car manufacturers test their car model on the open road, making it easy prey for Lehmann, unhindered by trespass laws. Commonly he frequented Death Valley or in desert areas in the United States, Australia or North Africa in the summer, as well as Alaska or Scandinavia in the winter, where car manufacturers frequently test for temperature tolerance. He also frequents the N√ºrburgring. Although secretive about his sources, they are employees of car manufacturers, some of whom have had their contract terminated as a result. Lehmann's other sources are informants, including those in petrol stations and hotels. Lehmann also employs photographic assistants to work with him and prefers to keeps a low profile, shunning publicity Lehmann's most important piece of equipment is a ladder. Aside from his camera, his other important equipment is a 1000mm lens and a motor drive. In his job, Lehmann never works on his own, he is assisted by a minder who operates their hire car. He also sits in a tree if possible, which resulted in him being injured when spying on a testing session of a Ford Sierra at their test track in Cologne. His biggest scoop of all was the Volkswagen Golf, on a public road in Spain in 1973, the Mark II in Arizona, and the Mark III in Austria. His other best known shots were of the Ford Sierra, and the Ford Mondeo at a gas station in Las Vegas, Nevada whilst staking out Death Valley. It is not uncommon for Lehman to face hostilities from car manufacturers and has faced police arrests in his career. He was detained overnight once in Algeria for espionage charges for a photograph of an Audi 100. One of several lengths a car manufacturer will go to keep their development mule away from the lens of photographers like Lehmann. Due to its high development costs in the midst of a competitive market, these testing sessions are intended to be as secretive as possible to prevent competitors gaining an advantage and sometimes developing a similar vehicle of their own. It has become a common practice for car manufacturers to mask details of their prototypes to make the car very difficult to be recognised, sometimes using \\"protection cars\\" that drive alongside the test car to block the view of the prototype from photographers. Aside from the motoring press, Lehmann's photographs have appeared in the German news magazine Stern and additionally had been offered to sell his photographs to rival Japanese car manufacturers. Manufacturers have also resorted to placing the badge of a rival manufacturer in an attempt to foil photographers like Lehmann, and sometimes placing engines and suspension systems inside the bodyshells of rival manufacturers. They cancelled advertisements at magazines who dared to feature Lehmann's photographs as retaliatory measures Legal issues Manufacturers such as BMW, Volkswagen, Rover and Porsche have unsuccessfully attempted to take legal action against Lehmann for industrial espionage. As a result of his and other photographer's activities who followed his example, car manufacturers have become more secretive, some resorting to developing their private testing sites. Renault for example, used a secret rocket-testing site for cold weather testing in Kiruna, near the Arctic Circle in northern Sweden. Audi conduct their tests on their own proving ground, their cars clad in full-cover canvas blankets. Private testing facilities make it difficult for photographers to enter the site without authorisation. In addition to private sites, car manufacturers test their cars dead at night and in dawn on public roads. Volkswagen in the mid-seventies have attempted to have Lehmann's driving licence suspended, alleging that he drove dangerously and blocked a road while photographing one of its prototypes, when it was revealed that one of the car manufacturer's test driver had blocked the road. Rover attempted to obtain a High Court order to search the house of one of his British associates, citing a breach of copyright. One unnamed British car manufacturer went as far as recruiting John Stalker, a retired deputy chief constable of Greater Manchester Police to attempt to discover the source of the information. Recent times Lehmann reportedly announced his retirement in April 2008, but continued to run his picture syndication company, Lehmann Photo Syndication. He currently resides in the outskirts of Hamburg in a house by the River Elbe with his wife and business partner, Christa, also a photographer. His favourite cars amongst his collections are the Porsche 911 Speedster and the Mercedes S-Class Coupe. He published a book in 1985 titled Testfahrer und Autospione: Abenteuer mit geheimen Automobilen (Test Drivers and Car Spies: Adventures with Secret Automobiles).

The six buildings have a total of 749 apartments, which house 1,823 people. Clinton Houses occupies the two blocks that are bordered by East 110th Street to the north, Lexington Avenue to the east, Park Avenue to the west, and East 108th Street to the south. It also occupies the western half of the two blocks that are bordered by East 106th Street to the north, Lexington Avenue to the east, Park Avenue to the west, and East 104th Street to the south, with the exception of a small part along East 106th Street.  About  The Housing Committee's proposals for the development were held in 1959. At the hearing Jane Jacobs accused NYCHA of discriminating against the poor through displacement and embracing architecture oriented for middle-class need advocating instead for retaining the social structure of the community by mixing low-rise buildings in with typical high-rises. The Clinton Houses were designed by Perkins and Will and partially funded federally. It was one of the first vest-pocket properties which retained the city's street grid in response to Jacobs but was in the tower-in-the-park style to supply light and air. The development was completed on October 31, 1965. The development was named after DeWitt Clinton (1769-1828), who served as Mayor of New York City and Governor of New York. As mayor, Clinton fought for free public education, to remove voting restrictions from Catholics, and public welfare. As governor, he helped found the New York public school system, and introduced a bill into the New York State Senate to build a canal connecting the Northeastern United States with the Great Lakes via Lake Erie.

Snowboard cross, also known as boardercross, is a snowboard competition in which four to six competitors race down a course. Snowboard cross courses are typically quite narrow and include cambered turns, various types of jumps, berms, rollers, drops, steep and flat sections designed to challenge the riders' ability to stay in control while maintaining maximum speed. It is not uncommon for racers to collide with each other mid-race. Snowboard cross courses share common traits with motorcycle motocross courses, hence the similarity between the names of each sport. Competition format is typically a time trial followed by a knock-out tournament. History When Steven Rechtschaffner and partner Greg Stump had run out of ideas for segments for a TV show they were producing for Fox TV called Greg Stump's World of Extremes, they recalled this concept that had been in Rechtschaffner's head for years. Given the need to come up with a final segment, Rechtschaffner, a passionate snowboarder, pitched the idea to Stump, who loved it, and Blackcomb Mountain, who put up prize money and snowcat time in order to build the first-ever course in 1991. John Graham, who was Stump's business manager at the time, was credited with coming up with the name boardercross. After being seen on the Fox TV show and re-aired on MTV Sports, other people started putting on boardercross events in Canada, the U.S. and Australia. Rechtschaffner travelled to many of these events in order to help others learn how to build the boardercross courses. Rechtschaffner had trademarked the name Boardercross primarily as a way to ensure that people putting on events did so in a positive way that was safe, exciting and respectful to the world of snowboarding. For these same reasons he denied the ski sanctioning body F.I.S. the rights to use the Boardercross moniker, as he shared the majority of snowboarders' belief that a ski sanctioning body should not be in charge of snowboarding events. That‚Äôs why Boardercross is referred to by the F.I.S. as ‚ÄúSnowboard Cross‚Äù in Olympic events, even though the overwhelming majority of boardercross racers still refer to their sport by the original snowboarding term. In 2000, Rechtschaffner channeled the spirit of boardercross in a series of hit video games he produced for Electronic Arts called SSX, which sold over 8 million copies over the following years. In 2006, boardercross (referred to as snowboard cross) became an official Olympic event at the Turin Olympic Games. It was also included in subsequent Winter Olympics. Equipment All participants need a snowboard to compete. The snowboard should be fairly stiff (but not a hard board). A mouth guard, though not always required, is recommended. Since participants are competing side-by- side tight clothing is essential to ensure competitors are not getting caught on each other's gear. As competition increases in intensity some riders choose to wear body armour to ensure safety when competing at high speeds. Helmets are required equipment for racing in FIS sanctioned events. Major multi- sport competitions Boardercross had been an event in every X-Games since their start in 1997. However, it was dropped after the 2012 X-games only to be reintroduced in 2014. It made its Winter Olympics debut in 2006. In culture Early releases in the EA Sports SSX (Snowboard Supercross) series of video games were loosely based on boardercross. Sonic Riders, a Sonic the Hedgehog racing game in which SEGA characters race on hoverboards, is partly inspired by boardercross.
