Richard was born around 1045 to Drogo of Hauteville, a Norman adventurer and count, and Altrude of Salerno, a Lombard princess. He was a nephew of Robert Guiscard and Roger I of Sicily. On his father's death in 1051, he was too young to succeed, and his uncle Humphrey was elected count instead. On Humphrey's death, his cousins, Abelard and Herman were overlooked by their uncle Robert. While Abelard rebelled, claiming the inheritance, Richard allied with Robert and Roger. Richard was present with Guiscard at the fall of Bari in April 1071 and fought strongly against his rebel cousins and their allies between 1078 and 1080, when Abelard died. For his support, Richard was confirmed as count of Castellaneta, Oria, and Mottola by his uncle. In 1101, Richard was appointed seneschal of Apulia and Calabria by the Guiscard's son and successor, his cousin, Roger Borsa. Sources *Ghisalberti, Albert (ed).

She also stars in it as one of two organ thieves who remove organs from their captives while they are still alive. It is known for its excessive gore and violence. Plot Two undercover detectives, Numata and Tosaka, infiltrate a plastic covered den where they discover a gang of organ thieves led by the high school teacher Saeki and his one-eyed sister Yoko (Kei Fujiwara) who are in the middle of cutting open a victim who is still alive. After a gun battle ensues, Tosaka is captured and Numata escapes, but not before Numata is injected with a mysterious liquid. He stumbles around the streets in a daze and is fired from his job. Tosaka's identical twin leads the other police officers in a search to find his brother, but when they finally find him, he's nothing more than a human vegetable. Saeki works as a biology teacher at a girls' high school where he offers private lessons to teens whom he harvests for virgin blood and organs. We learn later that Saeki's mother bit off his genitals when he was young and, like his victims, Saeki is now rotting away. Yoko tries to defend the two of them from the police, as well as the organ thieves' yakuza bosses who are not happy with the sudden police presence. Production After working on the production of Tetsuo: The Iron Man, Kei Fujiwara formed an experimental theater company called the Organ Vital company, which produced a play called Organ. The company then adapted the play into the film Organ. The cast pooled together their savings to buy the film stock and lights, borrowed camera equipment from friends, and also filled all the technical roles themselves. The sets were constructed using free materials they foraged. Fujiwara only allowed one take for each shot, unless there was a technical error. She told the actors that they could do more takes if they paid for the additional film footage, knowing full well that the actors couldn't afford that; she says this helped the actors focus on getting the best performance the very first time. Release The film screened at the 1996 Toronto International Film Festival and the Vancouver International Film Festival. For the Japanese release of the film, Eirin ordered eight minutes of the film to be cut out. Foreign distributors instead released the full 110 minute version of the film. Reception The film has seen generally negative reception from English critics. Derek Elley of Variety compared the film to the Japanese film Tetsuo: The Iron Man stating that \\"where 'Tetsuo' had a cartoonish energy, 'Organ' is an increasingly limp farrago of body make up and ketchup. Fujiwara makes an impressions as the bizarre one-eyed amazon, but her role, like all others, is undeveloped.\\" Time Out London wrote that \\"Diminishing returns hit splatter movies faster than most other genres, and this starts straining for effect and repeating itself within its first hour\\". Jason Gibner of Allmovie awarded the film three stars and wrote that though the film \\"can often be impossible to watch, the overall bizarre nature of the film will hook some viewers who want to discover where this twisted gore fest will go next.\\" NotesExternal links  Category:1996 horror films Category:1990s crime thriller films Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese horror films Category:1996 films ","title":"Organ (film)"},{"id":"25783743","text":"Murray John Mills (born 29 May 1936) was the 13th Anglican bishopAnglican Taonga of WaiapuAnglican Diocese of Waiapu from 1991 to 2002.

Background Roger Martin Kyes was born in East Palestine, Ohio, on March 6, 1906, and was a graduate of Culver Military Academy (Summer Culver Naval School), the Rayen School at Youngstown, Ohio, and, in 1928, Harvard University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. Career Kyes worked at GM for Charles Erwin Wilson, who brought him along to DoD. Industry After graduation from Harvard, Kyes worked from 1928 to 1930 as an assistant to the president of the Glenn L. Martin Company in both Cleveland and Baltimore and then, from 1930 to 1932, as assistant to the vice president of the Black & Decker Mfg. Co.. Kyes got his start in farm implements in 1932, as vice president running a Cleveland firm, the Empire Plow Company, which supplied implements to the Ferguson Company. In 1940, Harry Ferguson persuaded Kyes to join the Ferguson Company and Kyes relocated from Cleveland to Dearborn, Michigan. As executive vice president and general manager from 1941 to 1943 and president from 1943 to 1947 of the Ferguson‐Sherman Manufacturing Corporation in Detroit, Kyes was responsible for overseeing the firm's day-to- day business operations. Kyes left the Ferguson Company in 1947, joining General Motors. In 1949, Kyes was appointed assistant general manager of the transit bus division (Truck and Coach Division) of General Motors Diesel Division. Kyes was responsible for the division in the period in which transit buses overtook streetcars as the primary form of public transport in most large American cities. Government In 1953, President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower named GM president Charles Erwin Wilson as United States Secretary of Defense. Wilson asked to be allowed to bring Kyes along, so, at Wilson's request, Eisenhower nominated Kyes as United States Deputy Secretary of Defense. Kyes was sworn in on February 2, 1953, and served as Deputy Secretary of Defense until May 1, 1954. Upon becoming Deputy Secretary of Defense, Kyes criticized the United States military-defense establishment as dominated by \\"unrealistic requirements, poor planning and inefficient execution . . . waste of money, poor utilization of manpower, unnecessary drain of materials from the civilian economy, and the inefficient use of tools, equipment and facilities.\\" He slashed the defense budget in an attempt to improve efficiencies, in the process gaining himself the nickname of \\"Jolly Roger\\" because of his piratical ruthlessness. As Deputy Secretary, Kyes was a member of the Committee on International Information Activities. Kyes agreed to come to Washington, D. C. for only a year, although Defense Secretary Wilson convinced Kyes to stay a few months longer to help explain the administration's \\"New Look\\" defense concept to the United States Congress. When some editors speculated that Kyes was leaving because he was afraid of being called before the McCarthy hearings, the tough minded Kyes said he was not afraid of a fight. President Eisenhower awarded Kyes the Medal of Freedom for his service to the country. Industry again Upon leaving government, Kyes returned to General Motors, becoming an Executive Vice President in 1965. In the 1960s, he clashed with John DeLorean. In 1969, Kyes left General Motors to become chief executive officer of the American Steamship Company. At the beginning of 1971 he joined Lazard Freres as a General Partner.The New York Times, January 7, 1971 Death Kyes died of a heart attack in 1971 in Columbus, Ohio at the wedding reception of a niece.

Cornelius) is a self- unloading bulk carrier lake freighter built in Toledo, Ohio in 1973 for the American Steamship Company. An American Steamship Company vessel was christened the Roger M. Kyes in his honor on July 28, 1973 by his wife at Toledo, Ohio. Kyes was active in the Presbyterian church. In 1954, he was ordained a Ruling Elder in the Church.

He was born at Bourges around 1656 or 1658, and died before June 1728.Curtis, pp. 8, 13-14. Said to be the son of a doctor from Issoudun, he joined an acting company based in Rouen called the troupe du Dauphin in 1679 and again in 1681. In Amiens in 1686 he married Marie Saintelette, daughter of a baker from Verdun.Curtis, pp. 8-9. In March 1694 he and his wife joined the troupe of Leopold, Duke of Lorraine; the following year he auditioned for the Comédie-Française and was accepted for a quarter-share position. Instead of remaining in Paris, however, he returned to Lorraine and headed the duke's troupe from 1695 to 1705.Curtis, pp. 11-12. Typically of provincial actors at the time, he led an itinerant life; various documents place him in Boulogne-sur-Mer in 1697; in Metz in 1688, 1698 and 1701; in Verdun in 1693; in Strasbourg in 1699 and 1702, in Nancy in 1699; in Marseille in 1705; and in 1727 in the Electorate of the Palatinate.Curtis, pp. 12-13. Jean Quinault is remembered chiefly for his children, almost all of whom learned their craft in their father's troupe and went on to become successful actors. For part of the early 18th century, they dominated the Paris theater. *Jean-Baptiste-Maurice Quinault, baptized 9 September 1687, died 3 September 1745 in Autry-le-Châtel, near Gien. He made his début at the Comédie-Française in May 1712 and was accepted into the troupe the next month. He played both tragic and comic roles, but was most praised for the latter. He retired from the stage in 1733, returned briefly in 1734, then retired to Autry where he spent the rest of his life.Curtis, pp. 9, 15-16. *Françoise Quinault, born probably in 1688 in Metz, died 22 December 1713 in Paris; also called Mlle Denesle. She made her début at the Comédie- Française in January 1708 and was accepted into the troupe later in the year. She was unhappily married to a would-be actor named Denesle, and in poor health; she died at the age of 25.Curtis, p. 9, 14-15. *Abraham-Alexis Quinault, born and baptized 9 September 1693 in Verdun, died 12 February 1767 in Paris; called Quinault-Dufresne. He made his début at the Comédie-Française in October 1712 and was accepted the same year. He was handsome and had musical talent. Until his retirement in 1741 he was the principal male star of the troupe in both tragic and comic roles.Curtis, pp. 9, 16-20. *Marie-Jeanne Quinault, born 21 December 1697 in Boulogne-sur-Mer, died 9 November 1793 in Paris; usually called Marie-Anne-Catherine, Marie-Anne-Christine, or Mlle Quinault l'aînée (the elder). She made her début at the Comédie-Française in January 1714 and was accepted into the troupe the next month. She was the most beautiful of the Quinault sisters, but not the most talented, and she played primarily young women in light comedies. She retired very quickly, in 1722, and had a long liaison with the duc de Nevers; there is strong evidence to suggest that they had a child together and contracted a Morganatic marriage.Curtis, pp. 10, 22-25, 34-36. *Jeanne Quinault, born and baptized 13 October 1699 in Strasbourg, died 18 January 1783 in Paris; usually called Jeanne-Françoise, or Mlle Quinault la cadette (the younger). She made her début at the Comédie-Française in June 1718 and was accepted in December. She was a very popular actress in comic roles, especially the saucy and resourceful Soubrette parts. She was also one of the most intelligent members of the troupe, and is reputed to have advised Voltaire and Pierre-Claude Nivelle de La Chaussée on writing some of their hit plays. After her retirement in 1741, she became the hostess of a famous salon, called the Bout- du-Banc. She took responsibility for her eldest brother's orphaned children after his death in 1745. In 1758, she moved from her Paris apartment to the more rural Saint-Germain-en-Laye, where she lived quietly and corresponded with friends, until failing health led her to return to the city in 1778.Curtis, p. 10-11, 187, and passim. *François Quinault, birth and death dates and places unknown, but recorded as acting in the theaters of the Paris fairs from 1738 to 1742, Valenciennes in 1746, Thionville in 1749, Nancy in 1750, and the troupe of the Prince of Orange in the 1750sCurtis, p. 12-13; Dainard, ed., Correspondance de Mme de Graffigny, letters 1501, 1502 and 1504. In addition, in 1727 Abraham-Alexis married one of the female stars: *Catherine-Jeanne Dupré, born about 1705, died 15 July 1767 in Saint-Germain- en-Laye; she was originally called Mlle de Seine, but after her marriage was also called Mlle Dufresne or Mlle Quinault-Dufresne. She made her début in 1724 at Fontainebleau, where the company was performing before the court, and she was accepted into the troupe a few days later. Her marriage and her career were marked by scandals and conflicts, and she retired in 1736 claiming poor health.Curtis, pp. 19, 20-22. And in November 1727, a cousin made her début: *Marguerite-Marie-Thérèse-Élisabeth Étienne, born 3 August 1701 in Verdun, died 7 September 1746 in Paris, called Mlle Balicourt or de Balicourt. Her mother and Jean Quinault's wife were sisters. She was accepted into the troupe in January 1728, and played the roles of queens and powerful women, but poor health led her to retire in 1738.Curtis, pp. 37-41, 125-27.

It was established by Knyaz Alexander I and named after his patron saint (Alexander Nevsky). History The order was established with a decree on 25 December 1881, in honour of the patron saint of Alexander Battenberg. Initially it was planned to have five grades and a Necklace but subsequently four grades and Grand and Lesser Necklace were formed and in 1908 a Grand Cross was added. With time wartime grades with swords in the middle and above the cross were added. The order was awarded to Bulgarian and foreign citizens with the personal benevolence of the Bulgarian monarch, who was the Grand Master. Description The order had a white enamelled cross pattée with golden or silver edges according to the grade. On the pendant of the obverse there was a stylized inscription with the name of the order and on the surrounding ring there was the motto СЪ НАМИ БОГЪ (God with us) with laurel wreaths below. On the reverse there was a white background with inscription 19 ФЕВРАЛЪ 1878 (19 February 1878) - the date of the signing of the Treaty of San Stefano. Atop the cross was a royal crown. The first grade was worn with a crimson moire ribbon over the right shoulder with a rosette in the edge. It had its own eight-ray silver star with the obverse of the order placed in the middle. The Grand necklace consisted of thirty interconnected medallions with crowned lions, alternated with the monogram of the founder Knyaz Alexander I and eight edges Orthodox cross. There was a special issue with two field marshal's batons which belonged to Tsar Ferdinand. The Lesser Necklace was similar to the Grand Necklace but in smaller size. The Grand Cross, established in 1908, was also similar to the initial issue but the cross was enamelled in green and in the middle of the pendant was placed a crowned Bulgarian lion. The star was of similar design with green ring around the crowned lion on red background. The other grades are like the first issue but smaller in size. The sixth grade was made in silver without enamel over the shoulders of the cross. The Ottoman sultans Abdul Hamid II and Mehmed V were respectively awarded the Grand and Lesser Necklace of the Order of St Alexander with diamonds. They are currently kept in the collection of the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul. Grades *Great Cross of the Order of St Alexander, Grand and Lesser Necklace *I grade, Grand Cross. Awarded to senior state officers and military personnel. It was worn with a scarf over the shoulder. *II grade, Grand Officer Cross.

It is the 11th episode from Season 4 and the 76th episode overall. Plot The story begins with Betty pleading with her landlord, Mr. Z, after she knocks on his door and he asks for the rent. She explains that she doesn't have enough money and has had a horrible week so far. So he gives in, and, in a series of flashbacks, she starts explaining her story... Two days earlier, Betty tells Marc that she wants to write something that inspires people. He then gives her an assignment from Wilhelmina to write about stilettos, but she finds the piece too light. Meanwhile, at the federal pen, Wilhelmina and Connor kiss, only to have Connor tell her that as much as he loved her, Connor is not so sure if he wants Wilhelmina in his life. He feels that she is giving up too much of her own life just to be with him. As Marc talks to Daniel at his office, Wilhelmina walks in, saying that she wants Marc back. So the two agree to share him for a while. At a cafe, and after overhearing a couple talking, Betty and Matt talk about their future together, when all of a sudden she observes different people wearing shoes. This gives Betty an idea to do a story called \\"Walk a Mile In Her Shoes\\" which is about people who do inspiring things that help change the world. But Wilhelmina, who wanted Betty to write the story that she gave her, does not approve her idea, and Betty walks away. Z is unsympathetic at this point but the camera pans to show Betty, complete with a sprained left ankle and peeling dry skin, telling him to let her finish... As Betty talks to Hilda about what has happened at work when she starts to believe that Wilhelmina is giving her a hard time, Hilda watches Bobby spill spaghetti on the floor and is starting to get moody around him. This prompts Bobby to try to tone down Hilda's behaviour now that she is expecting and facing raising another child after having done the same for Justin. Back at work, Betty begs with Wilhelmina to give her another chance, so Wilhelmina gives in. She admits liking the title of Betty's piece \\"Walk a Mile in Her Shoes\\", but in what can be called \\"torture\\", she gives Betty a pair of high heels and wants her to wear them for a mile so that she can write for them. Unfortunately, Betty is not feeling comfortable wearing them while walking the streets of New York City, and she bumps into Daniel, who is frustrated that Marc is beginning to screw around with his work schedule by rescheduling his appointments and altering his daily routines. Betty tells Daniel that he is not the best communicator and should give Marc more credit as he might be doing him a favor. They part before she slips and hurts her ankle. Betty returns the shoes to Wilhelmina while on crutches and tells her that she has submitted the story to her while in the hospital. Before Betty leaves, Wilhelmina gives her a Ukrainian moisturiser lotion (that caused Betty's skin to break out) to use as her next story piece, before proceeding to confide in Marc about her dilemma with Connor. To prove that she is committed to him, she surprises Connor by proposing to him in prison, and he accepts reluctantly. During dinner, Betty complains about Wilhelmina to Hilda, Matt and Justin, thus prompting the trio to convince Betty to start a blog. She agrees and they briefly celebrate until Betty notices the burns on her skin. The next day, Betty stops by Amanda's desk to ask her about using the apartment, but Amanda tells Betty that she and Marc moved out, which Betty only learns now because Amanda had earlier tried to tell Betty weeks ago but wasn't paying any attention to who she was talking to and kept on forgetting what she is going to say. Betty is disappointed, having not known that Amanda would be giving up the apartment for good, but Amanda reminds Betty that she gave it up a year ago to help out her family, so it shouldn't be a big deal. At her beauty shop, Bobby tells Hilda that he will put her on a what he calls a \\"Hilda Week\\", in which they get a chance to spend some time together while he pampers her. Hilda accepts, as witnessed and encouraged by a customer. Daniel continues to be frustrated with Marc's apparent ineptness when Marc spills coffee over his brown jacket and quickly swaps it for a slimming black jacket from Daniel's dry-cleaning before sending him to a meeting at a different location than Daniel originally planned. During an evening out together, Hilda and Bobby stop by to see if the local nightclub is open, as he wants to show Hilda a concert featuring Ace of Base, which happens to be their favorite group. However, the club is closed and he cuts a finger. Hilda then tells Bobby that the group is playing the next day after Bobby thought it was this evening. At the apartment, Betty and Matt prepare to set up the blog and gets in a series of interviews from ordinary people, including a woman who talks about her experiences in helping people in Botswana. After Betty gets off the phone with Matt while launching her blog, she gets a knock on the door from her landlord Mr. Z to ask her about what happened to the two months back rent. Z takes offence to this story, thinking Betty depicted him as the worst part of the week; but Betty stuns him by taking off her hat and showing her overpuffed hair, persuading him to let her continue with her story... The next day, Betty confronts Amanda over not paying the rent, and makes it clear to Amanda that she must pay by blocking her from getting out of this excuse by using her crutches with force. A panicked Amanda gets the message. Betty asks Marc about why she wasn't informed about them moving out, but he doesn't remember and stops by to give her a shampoo bottle (that destroyed her hair) to do a piece on. Moments later, Matt stops by tell her that after being moved by the Botswana story that he has decided to sign up for a six-month tour to help people in Africa, stunning Betty. As Daniel arrives to another unexpected and rescheduled meeting, he proceeds to complain to Amanda, who reminds him he isn't the best communicator and need to give Marc credit. She then casually mentions that Wilhelmina would want Marc back, prompting Daniel to think that Marc is trying to sabotage him so he can go back to Wilhelmina. During the afternoon, Bobby takes Hilda back to the club to see Ace of Base, when all of sudden Justin calls his mother, as he is home with the flu. Concerned over Justin's sickness, Hilda tells Bobby to enjoy the concert on his own and races back home. Meanwhile, back at the prison, Wilhelmina and Marc show up to see her get hitched to Connor. However, moments after trying to bribe a guard, the guard tells Wilhelmina that Connor has been transferred to another prison. Wilhelmina goes hysterical now that she realizes that he initiated the ploy to get her out of his life. Over at Casa Suarez, Betty tells Hilda, who is tending to a sick Justin, about Matt's decision to go to Africa and how to stand up to Wilhelmina. When Hilda comes back to the living room, Bobby is there to give Justin a remedy for his cold, and tells Hilda that he wants to make sure that he'll do whatever it takes to make her feel good. They later hear Betty screaming after she sees her hair... ...So back at MODE, Betty finally walks up to Wilhelmina to complain about being tortured, only to see Wilhelmina stare at her window and tell Betty about her painful feelings for Connor jilting her at the altar. After a brief chat, Betty leaves Wilhelmina alone. She then asks Matt to meet her in the city. As he walks up to her and offers not to go to Africa, Betty tells him that he should take the opportunity. As he affirms that nothing will change the way she feels about her, Betty feels inspired to do her next blog post about goodbyes and hugs Matt sadly. Daniel finally confronts Marc about sabotaging him and urges him to go back to Wilhelmina if he wants to. However, as Marc explains to Daniel, it turns out that Marc was actually helping him because he has been attracting more unwanted attention in the press with his appearance and schedule, prompting Marc to intervene so that Daniel would not end up being tabloid fodder. Because of Marc's actions, Daniel has lost weight and looks better in a slimming suit and now has more paparazzi exposure. Also, designers are now chasing after him instead of the other way around. Marc then proceeds to shave Daniel's beard. Finally, back at Betty's apartment, Amanda shows up with rent money after selling her hair extensions, even though she was a little short but promises to make it up. Amanda tells Betty the reason for moving out was to help her get over Matt and that being in Betty's old apartment would make matters difficult. After Betty explains that Matt is moving away for a while and she is beginning to start over as well, Amanda urges her to take her apartment back. Finishing her story to Mr. Z, Betty promises to do whatever it takes to pay off the rent. But Mr. Z says that he'll raise Amanda's rent in order to cover the costs and allow Betty to move back into her apartment. He asks Betty about her story that she wants to submit, which he'll accept as part of her rent, and takes him up on that offer. As Betty reads her post on goodbyes, it becomes apparent that Connor bribed the guard earlier on before Wilhelmina's visit. All that Connor left to a devastated Wilhelmina is a note, saying: \\"Willie, I did this for you. I love you too much. - Connor\\". Meanwhile, Hilda admits to Bobby that she was freaking out over raising another child by herself; she doesn't have to worry about that anymore because Bobby is there for her, and they kiss. The final scene then returns to Betty and Matt sharing a final kiss before walking away, as Betty finishes her post by saying goodbyes will allow a chance to start over again.

It is based on work by Paul Rothemund, who first reported it in 1936. The method underpin more modern synthesis such as those described by Adler and Longo and by Lindsey. The Rothemund reactions is common in university teaching labs. Method The reaction employs an organic acidic medium such as acetic acid or propionic acid as typical reaction solvents. Alternatiively p-toluenesulfonic acid or various Lewis acids can be used with chlorinated solvents. The aldehyde and pyrrole are heated in this medium to afford modest yields of the meso tetrasubstituted porphyrins [RCC4H2N]4H2. The reaction entails both condensation of the aldehydes with the 2,5-positions of the pyrrole but also oxidative dehydrogenatioin of the porphyrinogen [RCC4H2NH]4. Brilliant crystals of meso-tetratolylporphyrin, prepared from 4-methylbenzaldehyde and pyrrole in refluxing propionic acid Reaction history The Nobel Prize-winning multi-step syntheses of Hemin and Chlorophyll by Hans Fischer. inspired the work of his student Paul Rothemund to develop a simple one pot synthesis of porphyrins. In 1935 Paul Rothemund reported the formation of porphyrin, from a simple reaction of pyrrole with gaseous acetaldehyde or formaldehyde in methanol followed by treatment with various concentrations of hydrochloric acid. One year later Paul Rothemund announced the applicability of his reaction to other aldehydes, by which he was able to explore large number of porphyrins. Here he detailed the synthesis of porphine, the fundamental ring system in all the porphyrins. He performed the Porphin synthesis at a temperature of 90-95 °C and high pressure in sealed pyrex glass tubes, by reacting with pyrrole in methanol, 2 % formaldehyde and pyridine for 30 hours. A simplified version of Rothemund porphyrin synthesis was described by Alan D. Adler and Frederick R. Longo in 1966. It utilizes mild organic acids as catalyst and reaction medium and is conducted in open air. Seventy aldehydes gave corresponding meso substituted porphyrins. The reaction time was shortened to 30 minutes and yield]s improved to 20%. The Alder-Logo reaction protocol was further modified by Lindsey et al. Using Lewis acid catalyst (Boron trifluoride) or strong organic acids (trifluoroacetic acid) inchlorinated solvents, yields improved to 30-40%. Green chemistry variants have been developed in which the reaction is performed with microwave irradiation using reactants adsorbed on acidic silica gel or at high temperature in the gas phase.

The firm also provides advisory services related to mergers and acquisitions, corporate restructurings and financings. Additionally, the firm manages a pool capital for private equity investments. SinoLatin Capital focuses on sectors of strategic importance to Chinese investors, such as oil and gas, mining, agribusiness and forestry. Latin America is a natural resource rich region that produces vast amounts of these commodities, much of which is now being exported to China. Highlighting this growing trend, in 2009 China became Brazil's largest trading partner and has growing trade relationships with many countries of the region. The firm also produces research on the fundamentals for Sino-Latin trade and provides a thought leadership framework for why the world should expect an increase in foreign direct investment by Chinese companies into Latin America. The firm was founded in 2009 by Erik Bethel Gonzalez, Luis Gomez-Cobo, Rafael Valdez Mingramm and Jorge Barreda Cruz. Background The People's Republic of China instituted its Go Global strategy to encourage its enterprises to invest overseas as China has amassed huge amounts of foreign reserves. In November 2008, the Chinese government unveiled its policy paper on “Latin America and the Caribbean” which was a call to both sides to increase the dialog and person to person exchanges at every level. At the same time, there has been an increase in the frequency of visits by high level Chinese delegations to Latin America and trade agreementshttp://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90883/6822048.html signed which lay the groundwork to bridge these two complementary regions together. Like Africa and Australia before it, Latin America has become of strategic importance as China continues its efforts to secure a long term supply of commodities to grow its GDP. For example, agriculture in China faces the limitations of having 10% of the world's total arable land support 20% of the world's population, requiring the country to seek secure sources of external food supplies. Additionally, urbanization in China will necessitate that China continue to make large scale strategic investments, whether they be majority or minority stakes in private or public corporations or greenfield projects in the commodities arena. Latin America is a logical place to source commodities like iron ore, copper and soy and recent deal activity highlight this trend. Beyond commodities, China can benefit from an increase in commercial ties in the areas of banking, tourism, manufacturing and infrastructure investments. History SinoLatin Capital was founded by three partners, senior investment banker and current CEO Erik Bethel, entrepreneur and current Chairman Luis Gomez Cobo, and founding partner Rafael Valdez Mingramm: * Bethel previously worked at ChinaVest, the oldest private equity fund in Mainland China and in the Latin American mergers and acquisitions, corporate finance and private equity groups at Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Partners, Emerging Markets Partnership, and Compass Point Capital Partners. He is based in Shanghai, China. * Cobo co-founded Sinolatin Capital and served as CEO of Los Olivos Alimentos, a leading Mexican agribusiness firm. He has wide experience in making private investments and participating in several enterprises, including Los Olivos Alimentos, Saeta Continental, Figo Transport, Empacadora Zan Alfonso, Nueva Tecnología en Alimentación (Nutec), and Ganaderos Productores de Leche Pura (Alpura). * Mingramm co-founded SinoLatin Capital and worked at ChinaVest, as a consultant for ProVentures, a financial advisory firm based in New York and advised The Synergos Institute on sustainable development initiatives along the U.S.- Mexico Border. On January 2011, Mingramm left SLC to pursue other ventures. On May, 2009 Jorge Barreda joined as partner of Sinolatin Capital. Previously he was heading the Andean Region effort at UBS Investment Bank, where he was an Executive Director.

Engraving by Eugène Louis Pirodon. Jeanne Quinault (baptized 13 October 1699 – 18 January 1783)Judith Curtis, \\"Divine Thalie\\": the career of Jeanne Quinault, SVEC 2007:08, pp. 10–11. was a French actress, playwright and salon hostess. She was usually called Mlle. Quinault la cadette (the younger) to distinguish her from her older sister, Marie-Anne-Catherine Quinault, also an actress. She herself thought her name was Jeanne-Françoise Quinault until 1726, when she obtained a copy of her baptismal record and discovered her legal name, but most references to her use the two given names. Stage career She made her début at the Comédie-Française on 14 June 1718 and was accepted into the company in December 1718, becoming the sixth member of the Quinault family to be admitted. She gave her first performance in the title role of Racine's Phèdre and five days later played Chimène in Pierre Corneille's Le Cid. The choices are rather surprising, because she became famous in soubrette and comic character roles. In 1727 Jeanne Quinault created the role of Céliante in Le Philosophe marié by Philippe Néricault Destouches. It was an ideal role for her, a strange, proud, moody and capricious woman, who was nonetheless vivacious, appealing and entertaining. This hugely popular play established her as one of the stars of the troupe.Curtis, p. 37. Writer Over a period of several months beginning in December 1731, Jeanne joined with a group of seven other friends to meet regularly and produce light-hearted, often parodic and satirical, theatrical entertainments, which they called lazzis, a term from the Commedia dell'arte meaning comic pantomime. The other Lazzistes included Jeanne's sister-in-law, formerly Mlle de Seine; her cousin Mlle Balicourt, who had joined the Comédie-Française in 1727; the poet and playwright Alexis Piron; the Comte de Caylus; Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux, Count of Maurepas; and Charles-Alexandre Salley. The Lazzistes were not the only such group that Jeanne Quinault frequented in this period, but it stands out, both because the men continued to play an important part in her life for years afterward, and because they kept a record of their activities, which has recently been rediscovered and published.Judith Curtis and David Trott, eds., Histoire et recueil des lazzis, SVEC 338 (1996). This document shows Jeanne to have been the driving spirit in the group. During the 1730s Jeanne Quinault became close friends with Piron; she advised him about his writing and, along with other members of her family, acted in his best play, La Métromanie (Obsession with Rhyming, 1738). She is credited with having suggested the ideas for Le Préjugé à la mode (The Fashionable Prejudice, 1735) to La Chaussée and for L'Enfant prodigue (The Prodigal Son, 1736) to Voltaire.René Vaillot, Avec Mme Du Châtelet, Oxford: Voltaire Foundation, 1988, pp. 58–62. Voltaire, who often wrote to Mlle Quinault for advice, told Françoise de Graffigny that the actress \\"was constantly imagining subjects for comedies and tragedies, and offered them to authors, urging them to work on them.\\" Dainard, ed., Correspondance de Mme de Graffigny, vol. 1, letter 96, pp. 338–39. She thus played a significant part in creating the vogue for comédie larmoyante (tear-jerking comedy), and it is not surprising that she later helped Francoise de Graffigny write her very successful example of the genre, Cénie (1750).Curtis, pp. 53–89. Société du bout du banc Mlle Quinault also continued to see Caylus in the 1730s, and in the 1740s they became co-hosts of the first incarnation of the informal salon called the Bout-du-Banc\\".\\"Bout-du-banc\\" means literally \\"end of the bench\\" but idiomatically something like \\"potluck\\". Françoise de Graffigny arrived in Paris just before the actress retired, and they soon became close friends. Her letters to her friend back in Lorraine, François-Antoine Devaux, give an unusually detailed account of the Bout-du-Banc's activities. Regulars included the poet Moncrif, the novelist Claude Crébillon, the novelist and historian Charles Pinot Duclos, and the financier philosophe Claude Adrien Helvétius. The fare was simple but good, and they entertained themselves by singing, acting skits, reading works in progress, and collaborating on anthologies of facéties, parodies of popular genres.Curtis, pp. 90–110. The first Bout-du- Banc ended in the late 1740s, in part because of dissension among the group, and in part because Jeanne Quinault was distracted by the need to take care of the children of her oldest brother, who died in 1745.Curtis, pp. 111–46. For the next few years she was closer than ever to Françoise de Graffigny, advising her on Cénie and helping to bring about the marriage of her ward, Anne-Catherine de Ligniville, to Helvétius.English Showalter, Françoise de Graffigny: Her Life and Works, SVEC, 2004:11, p. 233-51; D. W. Smith et al., eds., Correspondance générale d'Helvétius, Oxford: Voltaire Foundation, 1981, vol. 1. By August 1752 the Bout-du-Banc was convening regularly again, with some new members like the playwright and songwriter Charles Collé and Charles- Just de Beauvau, a prince from Lorraine. The most famous episode in the history of the Bout-du-Banc took place in 1754, when Duclos brought Jean- Jacques Rousseau to a dinner. Rousseau mentions the incident briefly in his Confessions, citing the invitation as proof of Duclos's continued friendship when others were abandoning him, and saying that he was cordially welcomed.Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Les Confessions, ed. Bernard Gagnebin and Marcel Raymond, Paris: Pléiade, 1959, p. 387 (book 8). Later, however, the scene was fictionalized, mainly by Diderot, as a debate between the anti- religious regular guests and the unexpectedly pious newcomer; and while the novel was never published, a nineteenth-century editor found the manuscript, replaced the fictional names with real ones, changed the title from Histoire de Mme de Montbrillant to \\"Mémoires de Mme d'Épinay, and published it in 1818.Raymond Trousson and Frédéric S. Eigeldinger, eds., Dictionnaire de Jean- Jacques Rousseau, Paris: Champion, 1996, pp. 302–303. For decades, this work, now called \\"pseudo-Memoirs of Mme d'Épinay\\", was regarded as authentic,E.g. by Francis Steegmuller, A Woman, A Man and Two Kingdoms: The story of Madame d'Épinay and the abbé Galiani (New York) 1991 and Ruth Plaut Weinreb, Eagle in a Gauze Cage. Louise d’Épinay femme de lettres, 1993; here any intervention by Diderot in Mme d'Épinay's fictionalized memoire is minimal; the literary history is summarized in Cécile Cavillac, \\"Audaces et inhibitions d’une romancière au XVIIIe siècle : le cas de madame d’Epinay\\", Revue d'histoire littéraire de la France 1004.4 (2004) and because of it the Bout-du-Banc was thought to be a den of Encyclopédistes and a hotbed of Enlightenment philosophy and its hostess a shameless freethinker.Curtis, pp. 191–200. In reality, Jeanne Quinault was careful to conceal her views, whatever they were, on religion and politics. She observed strict proprieties in her conduct, and seemed rather prudish at times to Françoise de Graffigny.Curtis, pp. 90–91. She was received by the nobility, and raised her wards to make marriages answering to the ideal of respectability of the time. In 1758, she moved from her Paris apartment to the more rural Saint-Germain-en-Laye, where she lived quietly and corresponded with friends, until failing health led her to return to the city in 1778.Curtis, pp. 10–11, 187, and passim.

The attack was carried out by 49-year-old Yasuhisa Sugiura (). Three people, including the gunman's mother- in-law, were shot dead before the perpetrator committed suicide. Shooting incidents such as these are rare in Japan. The perpetrator Yasuhisa Sugiura, 49, was a government employee in Japan's second-largest city Osaka. According to police, he was involved in a \\"troubled marriage\\" with a 48-year- old woman. Shooting On 12 January 2010, Sugiura went to the Ii-chan bar to discuss a divorce with his mother-in-law, 66-year-old Yoshiko Tanaka (), who would subsequently become one of his victims. The bar was open for business and had other customers inside; Sugiura's wife was possibly one of them. Sugiura then departed. Sugiura came back armed with a rifle and opened fire at approximately 20:00 that evening, killing three people. Two of Sugiura's targets -- the mother-in-law and a 23-year-old bar employee named Tatsuya Fukui () -- died immediately; a third, 49-year-old bar landlord Hiroto Uehara (), died shortly thereafter. Witnesses described the rifle shots as \\"three or four blunt bangs\\"; a pool of blood was left in front of the bar. Sugiura then exited the bar and shot himself in the abdomen, killing himself.

It overlaps with what political scientists call the Sixth Party System. Definitions of the Reagan Era universally include the 1980s, while more extensive definitions may also include the late 1970s, the 1990s, the 2000s, the 2010s, and even the 2020s. In his 2008 book, The Age of Reagan: A History, 1974–2008, historian and journalist Sean Wilentz argues that Reagan dominated this stretch of American history in the same way that Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal legacy dominated the four decades that preceded it. Ronald Reagan with a cowboy hat at Rancho Del Cielo. The Reagan Era included ideas and personalities beyond Reagan himself; he is usually characterized as the leader of a broadly-based conservative movement whose ideas dominated national policy-making in areas such as taxes, welfare, defense, the federal judiciary, and the Cold War. Other major conservative figures and organizations of the Reagan Era include Jerry Falwell, Phyllis Schlafly, Newt Gingrich, and The Heritage Foundation. The Rehnquist Court, which was inaugurated during Reagan's presidency, handed down several conservative decisions. The Reagan Era coincides with the presidency of Reagan, and, in more extensive definitions, the presidencies of Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump. Liberals generally lament the Reagan Era, while conservatives generally praise it and call for its continuation in the 21st century. Liberals were significantly influenced as well, leading to the Third Way. Upon taking office, the Reagan administration implemented an economic policy based on the theory of supply-side economics. Taxes were reduced through the passage of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, while the administration also cut domestic spending and increased military spending. Increasing deficits motivated the passage of tax increases during the George H. W. Bush and Clinton administrations, but taxes were cut again with the passage of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. During Clinton's presidency, Republicans won passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, a bill which placed several new limits on those receiving federal assistance. Campaigning for the Democratic nomination in 2008, Barack Obama interpreted how Reagan changed the nation's trajectory: Dates Most historians begin the era in 1980, when Reagan was elected president, and usually probe back into the 1970s for the origins of the Reagan Era. For example, Kalman (2010) explores multiple crises of the 1970s that eroded confidence in liberal solutions: the rise of the religious right and the reaction against the gay rights movement, feminism and the Equal Rights Amendment, grassroots reactions against busing ordered by federal judges, the defeat in Vietnam, the collapse of détente and fears of Soviet power, the challenge of imported cars and textiles, the deindustrialization of the Rust Belt, soaring inflation, stagflation, and the energy crisis, as well as the humiliation the nation suffered during the Iran hostage crisis and the sense of malaise as the nation wondered if its glory days had passed. She shows step by step the process by which one political alternative after another collapsed, leaving Reagan standing.Laura Kalman, Right Star Rising: A New Politics, 1974–1980 (Norton, 2010). The term \\"Reagan Era\\" is often used to refer to the United States only during Reagan's presidency, but it has also taken on an extended meaning that incorporates other periods. The George H. W. Bush presidency (1989–1993), the Clinton presidency (1993–2001), and the George W. Bush presidency (2001–2009) are often treated as extensions of the Reagan Era.Jack Godwin, Clintonomics: How Bill Clinton Reengineered the Reagan Revolution (2009) Wilentz additionally includes the Ford presidency (1974–1977) and the Carter presidency (1977–1981).Wilentz, pp. 1–2 The endpoint of the Reagan Era is often seen as the election of Democrat Barack Obama in 2008.John Kenneth White, Barack Obama's America: How New Conceptions of Race, Family, and Religion Ended the Reagan Era (2009); Marjorie Williams and Timothy Noah, Reputation: portraits in power (2008) Page xiv Midterm elections in 2010 and 2014 seemed to cast doubt on a true end of the Reagan Era as conservative Republicans claimed two major victories winning both the House and later the Senate. However, the sweeping policies pursued by the Obama Administration constituted a clear break with Reagan Era social issues, as Americans became more supportive of social issues like gay marriage and the legalization of marijuana. The 2016 election victory of President Donald Trump has stirred debate over whether his rise signifies the continuation of the Reagan Era or represents a paradigm shift for American politics. Political scientist Stephen Skowronek argues that Trump's election shows that the Reagan era continues. Skowronek compares Obama to former presidents like Woodrow Wilson and Richard Nixon, who governed at a time when their own party was generally in the minority at the federal level. Julia Azari, by contrast, argues that Trump's election signifies the end of the Reagan Era and the beginning of a new cycle in politics. Rise Wilentz traces the start of the Reagan era to the Watergate scandal, which ended the presidency of Richard Nixon and created an opening for a new Republican leader.Wilentz, pp. 4–5 Along with the Watergate scandal, the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the Vietnam War, and poor economic conditions created widespread public alienation from political leaders in the mid-1970s. A mass movement of population from the cities to the suburbs led to the creation of a new group of voters less attached to New Deal economic policies and machine politics.Wilentz, pp. 23–24 Reagan and other conservatives successfully presented conservative ideas as an alternative to a public that had grown disillusioned with New Deal liberalism.Wilentz, pp. 4–7 Reagan's charisma and speaking skills helped him frame conservatism as an optimistic, forward-looking vision for the country.Wilentz, pp. 137–138 Reagan challenged Nixon's successor, incumbent President Gerald Ford, in the 1976 Republican presidential primaries. Ford defeated Reagan to win the presidential nomination at the 1976 Republican National Convention, but he lost in the general election to the Democratic nominee, Jimmy Carter.Wilentz, pp. 64–72 During his presidency, Carter alienated many of those who had voted for him in 1976, including many in his own party. In the 1980 Democratic primaries, Carter defeated a strong challenge from the left in the form of Senator Ted Kennedy, who had clashed with Carter over the establishment of a national health insurance system.Wilentz, pp. 84, 116–121 Carter, and the Democratic Party as a whole, also alienated other voters, while the conservative movement gathered strength. A continually poor economy bred frustration over taxes, and voters became increasingly receptive to those advocating for a smaller government. A backlash also developed against affirmative action programs, as some whites claimed that the programs constituted reverse discrimination. The president had won a majority of evangelical Protestant voters in 1976, but the increasingly-politicized Christian right came to strongly oppose his presidency. Many of these religious voters were swayed by the public campaigns of leaders such as Jerry Falwell of the Moral Majority and Phyllis Schlafly, who opposed ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. Another important conservative organization, The Heritage Foundation, emerged as an important conservative think tank that developed and advocated conservative policies.Wilentz, pp. 83–93 With the backing of many in the conservative movement, Reagan defeated establishment favorite George H. W. Bush, moderate Congressman John B. Anderson, and others in the 1980 Republican primaries. To ensure party unity, Reagan named Bush as his running mate at the 1980 Republican National Convention, even though Bush had characterized Reagan's supply-side economics as \\"voodoo economics\\". Reagan mobilized his base by campaigning on his conservative positions, while the Carter campaign sought to portray Reagan as a dangerous extremist. An improving economy helped Carter overtake Reagan in the October polling, but Reagan won a decisive victory in an October 28 debate. On election day, Reagan narrowly won a majority in the popular vote but took the electoral vote by a wide margin, carrying 44 states. In the concurrent congressional elections, Republicans won several seats in the House of Representatives and took control of the Senate for the first time since the 1950s.Wilentz, pp. 120–125 Reagan's presidency Reagan in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 1982 Upon taking office, Reagan argued that the United States faced a dire crisis, and that the best way to address this crisis was through conservative reforms.Wilentz, pp. 127–129 His major policy priorities were increasing military spending, cutting taxes, reducing federal spending, and restricting federal regulations. Reagan believed that reducing the role of the government would lead to increased economic growth, which in turn would lead to higher revenues that would help pay down the national debt. Working with Congressman Jack Kemp, the Reagan administration introduced a major tax cut bill that won the support of enough Republicans and conservative Democrats to pass both houses of Congress. In August 1981, Reagan signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which enacted a 27% across-the-board federal income tax cut over three years, as well as a separate bill that reduced federal spending, especially in anti-poverty programs.Wilentz, pp. 139–144 A recession in the early part of Reagan's term, combined with tax cuts and increased military spending, led to an increasing deficit. Democrats won several seats in the House of Representatives in the 1982 mid-term elections.Wilentz, pp. 146–147 Reagan's approval ratings fell to 35%, and many Democrats believed that their party could defeat Reagan in the 1984 presidential election and roll back some of the Reagan administration policies.Wilentz, pp. 168–169 A strong economic recovery began in 1983 boosted Reagan's approval ratings, and the administration argued that the tax cuts had been the primary factor in turning the economy around. In the 1984 presidential election, Reagan won his party's re-nomination without facing a serious challenge, while former Vice President Walter Mondale won the Democratic nomination. On election day, Reagan won 59% of the popular vote and carried 49 states, leading to speculation of a permanent realignment in U.S. politics towards the Republican Party.Wilentz, pp. 170–175 Despite his re-election, Reagan faced significantly more difficulties in enacting conservative policies in his second term. His domestic agenda was hindered by growing deficits and the fallout of the Iran–Contra affair. However, the administration did win a significant foreign policy success when Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev reached the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty INF Treaty in 1987.Wilentz, pp. 176–177 Reagan also appointed numerous conservative judges, including Associate Justice Antonin Scalia and William Rehnquist, who Reagan elevated to the position of Chief Justice. The Rehnquist Court would hand down several conservative decisions in ensuing years.Wilentz, pp. 187–189 Vice President Bush defeated Senator Bob Dole and televangelist Pat Robertson to win the 1988 Republican primaries.Wilentz, pp. 264–266 Aided by Reagan's renewed popularity, Bush defeated Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential election.Wilentz, pp. 269–273 Reagan's successors George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton Bush's presidency focused largely on foreign affairs, and he faced a series of major foreign policy issues as the Eastern Bloc collapsed. Many of Bush's top foreign policy appointments, including National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, were realists who were influenced by Henry Kissinger. While the Berlin Wall fell and other Soviet-aligned countries experienced turmoil, Bush pursued friendly relations with Gorbachev, which played a part in the Soviet Union's assent to the reunification of Germany.Wilentz, pp. 290–296. Bush launched a successful invasion of Panama in 1989 and led a multinational coalition against Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War. After the quick U.S. victory in the Gulf War, Bush's approval ratings soared.Wilentz, pp. 293–294, 297–303 However, the Bush administration found less success in domestic policy, where deficits continued to be a major issue. Though Bush had promised not to raise taxes at the 1988 Republican National Convention, his hand was forced in part by the Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget Act, a 1985 law that purportedly required a balanced budget by 1993. After a long battle with the Democratic Congress, Bush agreed to sign the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, which contained a mix of tax increases and spending cuts. Conservative Republicans, who had never fully accepted Bush despite his move towards the right during the 1980s, were outraged by the deal.Wilentz, pp. 288–289, 307–310. Adding to the administration's challenges, the country entered a recession in 1990, with the national unemployment rate rising to 7.8%.Wilentz, p. 310. Even the fall of the Soviet Union in December 1991 did not greatly help Bush, as many conservatives credited Reagan's policies for the collapse of the U.S. long-time rival.Wilentz, pp. 313–314. Bush won his party's re-nomination after defeating a challenge from right-wing commentator and former Reagan official Pat Buchanan in the 1992 Republican presidential primaries. In the general election, Bush faced Democratic Governor Bill Clinton and an independent candidate, Ross Perot. Perot ran a populist campaign that focused on opposition the North American Free Trade Agreement and Bush's failure to balance the budget.Wilentz, pp. 316–317. Clinton, a founding member of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), focused on the poor economic conditions. In the three-way race, Clinton won a majority of the electoral vote and took 43% of the popular vote, while Bush 37.4% of the popular vote and Perot took 18.9%.Wilentz, pp. 318–322 Clinton's victory made him the first Democratic president since Jimmy Carter left office in 1981, and he began his term with a Democratic Congress. Though Clinton won early legislative victories such as passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, his administration was damaged by a series of minor scandals and the failure of his health care reform proposal.Wilentz, pp. 326–336, 341–346 In the 1994 mid-term elections, Republicans took control of both houses of Congress. In response, Clinton hired political consultant Dick Morris, who advocated a strategy of Triangulation between the Republican and Democratic members of Congress.Wilentz, pp. 350–351 In a major budget stand-off that involved two government shutdowns, Clinton won congressional approval of his own budget proposal, which avoided the deep cuts Medicare and other programs that had been sought by Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and other congressional Republicans.Wilentz, pp. 357–364 In 1996, Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, a Republican-authored bill which placed several new limits on those receiving federal assistance.Wilentz, pp. 364–367 Clinton had called for a reform of the welfare system during his 1992 campaign, wanting to add changes such as work requirements for recipients. In the 1996 presidential election, Clinton defeated Republican nominee Bob Dole by a wide margin in both the popular vote and the electoral vote. As Republicans retained control of Congress, he was unable to advance much of his domestic agenda.Wilentz, pp. 370–371 Economic growth was especially strong during Clinton's second term, and the unemployment dropped to 4% in 2000. In 1998, the government experienced its first budget surplus since the 1960s.Wilentz, pp. 371–372 Much of Clinton's second term was dominated by impeachment proceedings against Clinton, which stemmed from his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.Wilentz, pp. 382–398 Though the House voted to impeach Clinton, he was acquitted by the Senate, as all Senate Democrats and several Senate Republicans voted not guilty on both impeachment charges.Wilentz, pp. 398–400 Due to the strong economy, Clinton's Vice President, Al Gore, most Washington pundits regarded Gore as the early favorite in the 2000 presidential election.Wilentz, pp. 413–414 However, in an extremely close and contested election that ended in a controversial Supreme Court decision, Governor George W. Bush of Texas, the son of former President Bush, defeated Gore.Wilentz, pp. 418–429 Bush's administration included many prominent figures from previous Republican administrations, including Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, and Colin Powell.Wilentz, pp. 437–438 Upon taking office, Bush signed a major tax cut, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001.Wilentz, pp. 437–438 After the September 11 attacks, the Bush administration launched the Afghanistan War and the War on Terror, a global conflict against al-Qaeda and other groups.Wilentz, pp. 440–442 In 2003, the administration launched the Iraq War, which deposed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Despite the growing unpopularity of the Iraq War, Bush defeated Democrat John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election.Wilentz, pp. 443–444 In the two years after Bush's re-election, the Jack Abramoff scandals, the administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina, Bush's failed attempt to reform Social Security, and the Iraq War's continued unpopularity all weakened Bush's public standing.Wilentz, pp. 446–447 Aided by Bush's popularity and the Mark Foley scandal, Democrats won control of Congress in the 2006 elections.Wilentz, pp. 449–450 In 2008, a collapse in housing prices led to a major financial crisis, which marked the start of a prolonged economic downturn known as the Great Recession. In the 2008 presidential election, held in the midst of the financial crisis, Democrat Barack Obama defeated Republican John McCain. Obama defeated Republican nominee Mitt Romney and won re-election in 2012. Republican nominee Donald Trump defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and was elected president in 2016. Popular culture Statue of President Reagan in Budapest, Hungary. Tom Clancy wrote three best- selling novels that illuminate the Reagan era: The Hunt for Red October (1984), Red Storm Rising (1986), and The Cardinal of the Kremlin (1988), which reflect Reagan-era Cold War values. The Soviet Union as an evil empire and the superiority of American values and technology are all themes both of Clancy's thrillers and Reagan's rhetoric. Policy elites used these novels (and the filming of one of them) to promote their ideas of national security to the American public.Walter L. Hixson, \\"'Red Storm Rising': Tom Clancy novels and the cult of national security\\", Diplomatic History, Fall 1993, Vol. 17 Issue 4, pp 599–613 Kendrick Lamar has a song titled \\"Ronald Reagan Era\\" off of his 2011 album Section.80. Reagan appears as a character in the comic books The Dark Knight Returns (1986) and Legends (1986–87). International Many scholars take an international perspective, linking the Reagan Era with the Thatcher Era in Britain. As one scholar explained, :Throughout many of the capitalist democracies in Western Europe and in North America, the recession that began with the sharp rise in petroleum prices in 1973–74 signaled an epochal shift in the patchwork of growth- based economic and social policies....The demise of Keynesianism which followed meant far more than the obsolescence of an economic doctrine that had been used to justify a broad range of economic policies. It represented a significant retreat from a vision of society—the Keynesian welfare state—that had motivated state strategies to harmonise interests through social policy, to politically regulate the market economy and thereby reduce class and diverse social conflicts, and to promulgate for the state a tutelary role in securing business and trade union acquiescence (and less commonly approval) for a limited set of important economic policies.J. Krieger, \\"Social policy in the age of Reagan and Thatcher,\\" Socialist Register 1987 Historiography Historian Doug Rossinow reported in 2007, \\"As of this writing, among academic historians, the Reagan revisionists—who view the 1980s as an era of mixed blessings at worst, and of great forward strides in some renditions—hold the field\\".Doug Rossinow, \\"Talking Points Memo,\\" in American Quarterly 59.4 (2007) p. 1279.

It was led by George Galloway (a Respect Party politician) and Viva Palestina, a British charity. It travelled from the United Kingdom to the Gaza Strip during the winter of 2009–10, collecting volunteers and vehicles from other countries along the way, notably Turkey, due to the IHH (İnsani Yardım Vakfı) organisation. The Gaza Strip has been blockaded by Israel and Egypt since 2007, when Hamas took power in the territory following its victory in the 2006 Palestinian legislative election. A Palestinian protest in support of the convoy culminated in the fatal shooting of an Egyptian border guard by person unknown. Violent clashes between convoy members and Egyptian police led to the deportation of Galloway and other members from Egypt and a declaration by the Egyptian government that no similar convoys would be allowed to pass through the country in the future. Travel to Egypt The convoy departed from London on 6 December 2009.

She was known for developing a unique style of Cubism.  Biography  Blanchard was born on 6 March 1881 in Santander, Spain. She was the daughter of journalist Enrique Gutiérrez Cueto and Concepción Blanchard Santisteban. She was the cousin of Mexican artist Germán Cueto. She was born with several physical deformities, including a deformed spine, which some attributed to Blanchard's mother's fall during her pregnancy. Blanchard was born with kyphoscoliosis and bilateral hip disarticulation. Her growth was stunted and she walked with a limp, causing her to be teased at school and nicknamed \\"the witch,\\". The emotional pain this caused can be seen in many of her artworks' themes. Blanchard turned to painting to express her sadness. Her father was a large influence in her life, encouraging her to draw. Maternity (1925) In 1903, she moved to Madrid and studied at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando under Spanish artists such as Emilio Sala and . Sala taught Blanchard \\"precision\\" and the \\"exuberant use of colour,\\" which would feature in her early compositions. In 1908, after Blanchard won a third prize for her painting Primeros pasos at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts, the Santander government awarded her a grant to support her education in the arts. In 1909, this grant allowed her to continue her artistic education at the Academie Vitti in Paris under Hermenegildo Anglada Camarasa and Kees van Dongen.María Blanchard profile, Oxford Art Online; accessed 4 August 2015. Here she discovered cubist painting, and was influenced by Jacques Lipchitz and Juan Gris. In 1914, due to the First World War, Blanchard left Paris returned to Madrid. She shared a studio in her mother's house with some of the artists she met in Paris In 1915, her art was displayed in an exhibition organized by Ramón Gómez de la Serna at the Museo de Arte Moderno (Madrid). She was contacted to teach art in Salamanca (Madrid), but was disappointed by the experience and ultimately moved back to Paris. In 1918, after the end of the war, Blanchard moved to Paris, where she would spend the rest of her life. There, she met many Cubist artists and began developing her own style of Cubism. She became close friends with Juan Gris, a Spanish Cubist painter, who heavily influenced her work. Blanchard joined the Section d'Or, a Cubist art group Early paintings, such as \\"Woman With a Fan\\" , show flat, interlocked shapes. Her unique style evolved to become more figurative and traditional over the years; her paintings became harsh, with bright clashing colors and melancholic themes. The resulting artwork was very emotionally expressive. María Blanchard, 1916–18, Still Life with Red Lamp, oil on canvas, 115.6 × 73 cm Demand for Blanchard's art skyrocketed after the showings 1920 in France and Belgium, and the 1921 exhibition at the Society of Independent Artists. She came into contact with significant art dealers, but due to the adverse economic situation which followed, many collectors stopped investing in her work. She became financially dependent on her friend, Frank Flausch (1878–1926) until his death. Without Flaush, Blanchard was able to sell paintings to galleries in Paris and a few private patrons. In 1927, Gris died. Blanchard was severely affected and fell into a state of depression. Her sister, Carmen, and nephews came to live with her in Paris, alleviating her loneliness but worsening her financial situation. In her deteriorating health, Blanchard turned to religion and considered joining a convent, but never did. She continued painting to support her sister and nephews. Blanchard's health gradually declined over the following years. She contracted tuberculosis, making it impossible for her to paint. On 5 April 1932, she died at age 51 in Paris.

It lives in the coastal waters around Antarctica, further south than any other species of krill. The specimens for the species' original description were collected through holes cut in the ice by Robert Falcon Scott's Discovery Expedition, several thousand having been donated by Thomas Vere Hodgson. Description Adults of E. crystallorophias are smaller than those of E. superba, reaching a length of ; they can be distinguished from young E. superba by the large size of the eyes, and by the long, sharply pointed rostrum. Distribution E. crystallorophias is found around the coasts of Antarctica, replacing the more oceanic E. superba at latitudes above 74° south. It is usually found at depths down to , but has occasionally been found as deep as . Ecology E. crystallorophias feeds on bacteria, diatoms, detritus, and other microorganisms, including the algae that form on the underside of sea ice, and is in turn an important food source for fish, whales, and penguins, especially minke whales, Weddell seals, Adelie penguins, and the Antarctic silverfish. This makes it arguably the most important link in the coastal Antarctic food chain between the primary producers and the macrofauna. Unlike most other krill species, the eggs of E. crystallorophias are neutrally buoyant, meaning they do not sink, and the hatchling larvae do not have to swim back to the more productive, shallower waters; however, since this means both life stages inhabit the same depths, how the larvae avoid being eaten by the adults is not known.

History  The American Steamship Company was founded in 1907 in Buffalo, New York by partners John J. Boland and Adam E. Cornelius. Their first ship, the SS Yale was the first steel vessel owned by a Buffalo firm and earned large profits for the partners. Over the next five years, the company added six new vessels to their fleet. At the end of World War I, the American Steamship Company became the first Great Lakes steamship company to outfit all of its vessels with radio telegraph equipment. ASC acquired the Mitchell Steamship Company in 1922, thus adding another four vessels to its growing fleet. ASC was hard hit by the Great Depression, but took advantage of the downturn to convert three of its bulk freighters to self-unloading vessels, which would prove to be the way of the future in Great Lakes shipping. In the 1940s, self-unloaders would bring new business to ASC, and the focus of the company would shift from transporting iron ore and grain to shipping coal and limestone. During World War II, ASC was active in the war effort, at one point having twenty ships engaged in war trades around the world. The company embarked on a major expansion in the 1950s, though the company continued to be run by Boland and Cornelius and their sons. By 1965, ASC's annual volume exceeded 20 million tons, and the company again launched an expansion effort. In 1967, the firm acquired the Oswego Shipping Company. In 1973, the Boland and Cornelius families sold ASC to the General American Transportation Corporation (GATX). In the late 1970s and early 1980s, ASC became one of the first shipping companies to introduce computers on all of its vessels. From 2002 to 2006, the company partnered with Oglebay Norton Marine Services, and in 2006, acquired six vessels from Oglebay Norton, bringing the size of ASC's fleet to 18 vessels and making it the largest American domestic provider of dry bulk self-unloader transportation services on the Great Lakes. Their corporate parent, GATX, announced on their corporate website that an agreement for the sale of American Steamship Company was reached on February 7, 2020, and is awaiting regulatory approval.

Peter meets with Angela Petrelli to help her come to terms with Nathan Petrelli's death, then asks Angela where Sylar is. Although Angela doesn't want Peter to go anywhere near Sylar, Peter manages to acquire his location. Meanwhile, Matt Parkman is stunned to see Sylar at his home, who has created the ruse that he and Matt used to work together as cops to fool Janice. Matt is able to privately talk with Sylar in the basement, who reveals he wants Matt to use his ability to mentally suppress his powers and be normal again. Matt is unsure he can do it, but Sylar threatens Janice and Matt's son. Matt's initial attempt fails, causing Sylar to lash out and hold Janice with his telekinesis. Sylar explains these powers are what are making him insane, and Matt must get rid of his powers. Sylar lets Janice go, and Matt talks with her to make sure she's alright. Janice realizes the man is Sylar and tells Matt he must bury him for good so that he can't hurt anyone. Matt agrees, and then tricks Sylar into thinking he is ridding him of his powers. However, Matt explains he has trapped Sylar in his own nightmare: a world where no one exists but himself so that he will be alone forever. Matt takes the knocked out Sylar and begins building a brick wall around him in the basement to trap him for good, but he is then interrupted by the arrival of Peter. Borrowing Matt's ability, Peter learns where Sylar is and explains he needs Sylar so he can save everyone. Matt warns Peter of Sylar's state and that if Peter tries waking him, he may become trapped too. Peter touches Sylar's head, and finds himself in a world devoid of anybody. Peter is shown wandering a desolate city, calling out for anyone. After her encounter with Sylar, Claire Bennet visits Noah Bennet's apartment to speak to him about it, but instead finds Lauren. After entering, Claire notices the maps and realizes that Noah is planning to attack the carnival. Lauren tries to convince Claire to wait for Noah, but Claire decides to leave for the carnival. Meanwhile, Samuel Sullivan discovers his family's trust in him has shaken due to his demolishing of the town. Claire visits Lydia, revealing Noah's plan to take out Samuel, and that Samuel must turn himself in. They explain the situation to Samuel, who finally agrees after Claire urges him to take responsibility and protect his family. Claire calls Noah, who is watching Samuel through a sniper scope, and explains that Samuel will go with him peacefully. Noah agrees, and has Lauren head down to take Samuel in while he provides cover. Samuel addresses the carnival, telling them his decision to leave with Claire, but is interrupted by sniper fire to his shoulder. Shots continue to be fired, with many people injured, including Lydia, Claire, although she quickly heals, and even Lauren on her way down the surrounding hillside. It is then shown it isn't Noah who is firing, who looks around and spots Eli firing with his own sniper rifle. Noah takes him out with his sniper, but realizes it was just a copy as the real Eli appears behind him and knocks him out. Samuel finds Lydia, who is mortally wounded, and kisses her. In her dying breaths, Lydia uses her powers on Samuel, and is horrified to see Samuel had planned this, who explains he needed to create a villain in the form of Noah and have Lydia sacrificed. Eli brings Noah down for everyone to see, and the carnival quickly puts the blame on him and Claire. In his half-conscious state, Noah manages to tell Claire it wasn't him who had fired, but Samuel has Noah locked up in the house of mirrors and Claire in his trailer. Emma Coolidge later arrives, who Samuel is pleased to see, telling her she can help them make a new world and show everyone how great they can be. Lauren, having managed to spot Eli carrying Noah down to the carnival, places a call to Tracy Strauss, telling her she was told to call if Noah was in trouble.

He took the dr.philos. degree in 1931 on the thesis Zwei religiös-politische Begriffe. Euergetes. Concordia. When writing in Norwegian, he used the Nynorsk form. In 1934 he was promoted to professor of classical philology at the Royal Frederick University (from 1939: the University of Oslo). In the interwar period Skard marked himself as an opponent of Fascism, first and foremost as a follower of the Oxford Group. When Nazi Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Skard participated in the fighting in Gudbrandsdalen. Germany won, but one of many civil protests ensued when the Nazi authorities were about to change the rules for admission to the university in autumn 1943. In retaliation, the authorities arrested 11 staff, 60 male students and 10 female students. The staff Johannes Andenæs, Bjørn Føyn, Johan Christian Schreiner, Harald Krabbe Schjelderup, Anatol Heintz, Odd Hassel, Ragnar Frisch, Carl Jacob Arnholm, Endre Berner and Eiliv Skard were sent to Grini concentration camp. Skard was first incarcerated at Bredtveit from 15 October to 22 November, then at Berg until 8 December, then at Grini until 5 May 1945. An exception came in the last winter, when Skard spent a month at Victoria Terrasse. After the war Skard returned as professor, and was dean of the Faculty of Humanities from 1947 to 1952. On 1 February 1948 he became professor of the history of ideas with emphasis on the Antiquity. He edited the journal Symbolae Osloenses, and his most notable books were Filosofien i oldtiden (1951) and the three-volume anthology Vestens tenkere (1962) which he edited together with Andreas Hofgaard Winsnes. He died in September 1978 in Oslo.

Form This was erected into a special delict in the troubled times of the Republic, and the rules became a permanent part of the law. The action was in factum and condemnation involved infamy. The penalty was fourfold, or rather, as this included the value of the thing, for threefold and compensation. As it was penal and praetorian, it was annua, but, as it covered compensation as well, perpetua as to the single value. Hence it was said to be mixta by some jurists and Justinian so decides, but it had the main characteristic of penal actions that it was not available against the heirs of the wrongdoer. As the act was furtum there would always be the condictio furtiva. The principles were in general those of actio furti. Thus it applied only to res mobiles in commercio and owned. The contrectatio must be fraudulosa. On some points, however, there are slight signs of divergence. Thus we are told that what could be recovered was a multiple of the verum pretium, not of the interest the aggrieved had in the thing (interesse), but as one text tells us this of furtum also, the import is doubtful. Though in general those who could bring it were the same, one text, probably due to Justinian, says that any sort of interesse sufficed in this case; in classical law the rule of interesse was the same as in furtum. One text suggests that mere encouragement was enough to make a man liable for ope consilio, which is consistent with the genesis of the action. The action was a bar to actio furti and any action ad rem persequendam. Probably in classical law it was barred by actio furti, but under Justinian it was still available for any excess recoverable by it. It is plain that, in manifest theft, furti would be the better remedy, but not in other cases. It does not appear that the action could have been barred by vindicatio, at least as to threefold. Similar actions This delict involved bad faith, but violent enforcement of claims, even in good faith, needed repression. Such conduct had been criminal from the Republic, and Marcus Aurelius provided that one who seized property to satisfy a claim, without judicial process, should forfeit his claim. In A.D. 389 it was provided that one who seized property under a bona fide claim of right should, if the claim was well founded, forfeit his right, and if it was unfounded should give back the property and its value as well. This penalty applied to land as well as moveables. The actions by which these rules were enforced were no doubt ordinary proprietary actions, at any rate so far as the forfeiture of property was concerned. Whether, where the claim was well founded, the heres of the wrongdoer was equally liable does not appear; presumably he was not, and he could hardly have been liable to penalty in the other case.

(2002). The Life of Bruegel: Notes. Accessed January 12, 2010.) — known in English as The Land of Cockaigne — is a 1567 oil painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (c. 1525–1569). In medieval times, Cockaigne was a mythical land of plenty, but Bruegel's depiction of Cockaigne and its residents is not meant to be a flattering one. He chooses rather a comic illustration of the spiritual emptiness believed to derive from gluttony and sloth, two of the seven deadly sins.Martin, Elaine. (1998). \\"The Land of Cockaigne\\", in Representations of Food and Eating in the Works of Bruegel the Elder. Accessed January 12, 2010. Description In the painting, a clerk, a peasant, and a soldier lie dozing on the ground underneath a table bound to a tree. The clerk's book, papers, ink and pen lie idle, as do the peasant's flail and the soldier's lance and gauntlet. A half-eaten egg in its shell runs between the peasant and the clerk. The table attached to the tree is laden with partly consumed food and drink. Behind the tree, a roasted fowl lays itself upon a silver platter, implying that it is ready to be eaten, and a roasted pig runs about with a carving knife already slipped under its skin. On the left, a knight emerges from a lean-to whose roof is covered in dishes of pie and pastry, with an open mouth, waiting for a roasted pigeon to fly in (the pigeon was accidentally removed during restoration work). On the right and behind the main action, a man clutching a spoon forces his way out of a large cloud of pudding, having eaten his way through it; he reaches for the bent branch of a tree in order to lower himself into Cockaigne. The fence enclosing the main scene behind the dozing trio is made of interwoven sausages. A partly eaten wheel of cheese and a bush (or tower) of loaves of bread are on the left and right of the scene, respectively. Interpretation The arrangement of the clerk, peasant, and soldier underneath the tree suggests the men as the spokes of a wheel, where the tree is the hub. The roasted fowl lies in the place where a fourth spoke could be. Ross Frank has argued that the painting is a political satire directed at the participants in the first stages of the Dutch Revolt (1568–1648), where the roasted fowl represents the humiliation and failure of the nobleman (who would otherwise form the fourth spoke of the wheel) in his leadership of the Netherlands, and the overall scene depicts the complacency of the Netherlandish people, too content with their abundance to take the risks that would bring about significant religious and political change.Frank, Ross H. (1991). \\"An Interpretation of Land of Cockaigne (1567) by Pieter Breugel the Elder\\". The Sixteenth Century Journal. Vol. 22, No. 2 (Summer, 1991), pp. 299-329. Accessed January 12, 2010.

The center has opened a synagogue and Bet Midrash based in Miami, Florida, that is headed by Rabbi Benjamin Viñas Rabbi Manny's brother. Rabbi Manny Viñas has continued this period of growth for the organization by launching centers in Latin American countries in an effort to strengthen the communities of Anusim, who seek to return to Judaism and have a local community to call their own. This has garnered grassroots support throughout the Americas. During one such visit (June 2018) to the Dominican Republic at a lecture that attracted hundreds of followers, Rabbii Viñas was proclaimed by the leadership of the Sephardic Community as \\"the Father of the Anusim\\" for his love and dedication to the return of the Anusim to the ways of the ancestors and his relentless pursuit of education that will restore the Anusim to SEPHARDIC practice. Tora Tropical Tora Tropical is a Jewish bi-monthly newspaper sponsored by El Centro de Estudios Torat Emet. The first issue of Tora Tropical was published in 2004 under the Direction of Rabbi Rigoberto Emmanuel (\\"Manny\\") Viñas. Rabbi Viñas' classes can be seen on his Facebook page and on his YouTube Channel 'Torá Tropical.' There are hundreds of topics from history, to Zionism and Sefardic laws and customs, with over a million downloads. His students span the globe. His work attracts a large Anusim population.

It was originally performed at Seattle's La Pensee Discovery! Theatre in 1993 and ran at Lamb's Theatre from October 21, 1993 and closed on December 12, 1993 after 54 performances. Synopsis The story follows an all-American boy Johnny Pye in 1928, and following the passing of his father, he has advanced awareness of death. The bereaving youngster actually sees the figure of death: It is a deformed, portly workman wearing a smock and cap and toting a grindstone. It shows Johnny his aspirations: he wants to be a doctor, then a painter, then a minister, but ends up being the postmaster in his hometown of Martinsville, United States of America. Over the course of the show, Death (The Fool-Killer) can only be seen by Johnny. When they first meet, Johnny angrily challenges him. Johnny later leaves to serve in World War II, and when he returns after nearly dying, he steals the girl of his dreams from his arch enemy Wilbur. Through the several decades the show passes through (it ends in 1995), Johnny sees many of his loved ones get taken away. Johnny makes a deal with Death in the early process of their relationship: if Johnny can solve a riddle that the Fool-Killer presents, then Johnny's life will be spared. The second act deals with the happy marriage of Johnny and Suzy, and eventually to when they are great-grandparents and Johnny can't remember any of their names. Original Cast It was directed by Drew Scott Harris, musical staging by Janet Watson, set by Peter Harrison, costumes by Claudia Stephens, lighting by Kenneth Posner, sound by David Lawson, musical direction by Steven M. Alper, orchestrations by Douglas Besterman, and production stage manager was David Waggett.

History The northeastern coast of Maui has a small village named Hai kū which literally means \\"sharp break\\" in the Hawaiian language. The Haiku Sugar Company was chartered on November 20, 1858 by the Kingdom of Hawaii. It was one of the first ten companies to go into the sugar business in the Hawaiian Islands. The investors, the Castle & Cooke partnership, contracted with Isaac Adams of Boston and D. M. Weston for a milling machine and boiling house with total cost of US$12,000. The first crop was processed in December 1861. In 1871 Samuel T. Alexander became manager of the mill. He formed Alexander & Baldwin with his partner Henry Perrine Baldwin, and organized an irrigation system from 1876 to 1878 that allowed more steady crops to be grown in more leeward areas of the island. As a result, Haiku Mill was abandoned in 1879. In 1881 Kahului railroad allowed cane to be carried to larger mills near the town of Kahului. In 1905 the Haiku plantation merged with another to become Maui Agricultural Company, and later became the Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar Company division of Alexander & Baldwin with one remaining mill at Puunene. The Haikū area later became a pineapple plantation. The former cannery at 810 Haiku Road is now a shopping center called the Haiku Marketplace. Only the walls of the mill were left standing when it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 6, 1986 as site 86000189. It is state historic site 50-046-1622.

Sweden's SR and UR, Greenland's KNR and the Faroe Islands' KVF are associate members. Nordvision's main task is the co-production and exchange of television programmes. It has its secretariat in Copenhagen, at DR Byen.  History  The founding of Nordvision was primarily based on cultural rather than economic incentives. The Nordic countries are important potential markets for one another's productions. One of the original thoughts was to take advantage of the similarity of the Scandinavian languages, even if in practice, while the languages are closely related, they are too far apart to be fully understood without subtitles when television series are broadcast to the audiences in neighbouring countries. Nevertheless, other cultural similarities and the tradition of Nordic collaboration have favoured production and distribution of television programmes across Nordic countries. Television was introduced in Western Europe in the early 1950s but came late to most Nordic countries. Denmark started regular broadcasts in 1954, Sweden in 1956, Finland in 1957, while Norway did not begin until 1960. Sweden, Finland and Norway have a large territory but a relatively small population, and one reason for the late introduction of television was related to the feasibility a transmitter system that would provide the majority of the population with access. Moreover, the government policy for example in Sweden concentrated efforts and financial resources on the construction of a network of stations rather than on increasing programming hours. Thus, a regional programme exchange was also seen as a solution to programme supply, particularly in categories with high productions costs, such as entertainment and drama. In this context, television was seen as having a potential to make a major contribution towards developing and fostering Nordic cooperation. Whilst the more extensive European exchange system Eurovision already existed since 1955, the programming it provided was focused on sports, news and cultural events, due to the technological constraints posed by live transmissions and language differences as it would not have been possible to provide subtitles. Mainly because of the late start of television in Norway, Nordvision began later than its wider European counterpart. Denmark and Sweden had begun cooperating in TV production as early as the summer of 1958, but the official start of the Nordic exchange did not take place until October 1959. In contrast to Eurovision, the Nordvision exchange programmes also included light entertainment and popular music series, helping to make popular culture from the Nordic countries familiar across national borders.  Members  Members: * Danmarks Radio (DR, since 1959) * Sveriges Television (SVT, since 1959) * Norsk rikskringkasting (NRK, since 1959) * Yleisradio (YLE, since 1959) * Ríkisútvarpið (RÚV, since 1966) Associate members: * Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa (KNR, since 1997) * Kringvarp Føroya (KVF, since 2005) * Sveriges Radio (SR, since 2016) * Sveriges Utbildningsradio (UR)  Activities = Co- production and programme exchange  Nordvision hosts six programme groups where the co-production and programme collaboration take place on a practical level: Children, culture, drama, knowledge, factual and investigative journalism. Some of the most well-known Nordvision co-productions include: * Kontrapunkt (Music quiz from 1966 to 1991) * Fleksnes (Norwegian TV comedy from 1972 to 2002) * Matador (Danish TV series from 1978 to 1981) * Fanny and Alexander (Original title: Fanny och Alexander, Swedish film from 1982) * The Best Intentions (Original title: Den goda viljan, Swedish TV film from 1990 and series from 1991) * The Kingdom (Original title: Riget, Danish miniseries from 1994 to 1997) * Sophie's World (Original title: Sofies verden, Norwegian- Swedish Drama-adventure film from 1999) * Krøniken (Danish drama series from 2002 to 2006) * MGP Nordic (Melodi Grand Prix Nordic, Song contest for children) * The Eagle: A Crime Odyssey (Original title: Ørnen, Danish crime series from 2004 to 2006) * The Killing (Original title: Forbrydelsen, Danish crime series since from 2007 to 2012) * Borgen (Danish drama series since from 2010 to 2013) * The Bridge (Original title: Broen / Bron, Swedish-Danish crime series from 2011 to 2018) * SKAM (Norwegian youth TV series from 2015 to 2017)  Nordvision Fund  The Nordvision Fund, established in 1988, is an important financing source for major drama productions. The Fund gets its revenues from cable distribution of TV programmes from the partners in the Nordic countries. The Fund's money is earmarked for Nordic co-productions and joint projects, and aims at strengthening the Nordic cultural cooperation and to stimulate the use of Nordic authors and performing artists.  Collaborative forums and expert networks  The Nordic cooperation also contains a number of expert groups who meet regularly to exchange experience and knowledge. This collaboration encompasses several aspects, such as corporate strategy, program development, scheduling and copyright.

First-class cricket career Redman was a right- handed lower order batsman and a right-arm seam bowler, \\"only a little above medium pace\\". After playing club cricket for Bath Cricket Club, he was tried in two matches for Somerset in 1948; the second of these was the match against the Australian team known as the Invincibles, and Redman with three wickets for 78 runs was the most successful of the Somerset bowlers - though an Australian total of 560 for five wickets gave them victory by an innings and 374 runs inside two days. Redman was used primarily as an opening bowler for a weak side whose principal wicket-takers throughout his career were all spin bowlers. There were six matches and 11 wickets in 1949 and 10 matches with 16 expensive wickets in 1950. Seven of these 16 wickets came in one match against Surrey at The Oval, and in the first Surrey innings he took five for 50, the first five-wicket return of his career. Wisden noted that he bowled \\"at a fine pace\\" and that he took four wickets for 18 runs as Surrey fell to 49 for five before a recovery. In 1951, he played in all but the first of Somerset's County Championship matches - he appeared in 27 games - and was awarded his county cap. He took 50 wickets in all at the relatively high average of 33.76. After the third Championship match, Maurice Tremlett, who had taken eight wickets to that point, did not bowl again during the season, and Redman opened the bowling in every other game with Bertie Buse, also barely above medium pace; they were backed by the three spin bowlers, Ellis Robinson, Johnny Lawrence and Horace Hazell, and these five bowlers then took all of Somerset's wickets for Championship matches across the whole summer. Redman had limited numbers of successful days: against Nottinghamshire at Yeovil he took five wickets for 151 runs after Tremlett had withdrawn from the attack. But his best performance was a month later at Frome: in the Derbyshire first innings, bowling unchanged with Buse, Redman took seven wickets for 23 runs as Derbyshire were dismissed for just 52 in an hour and 45 minutes. This return, from what Wisden termed \\"deadly swing bowling by Redman\\", was the best of his first-class career. In addition to his bowling, Redman also batted usefully in the lower order in 1951, making 472 runs at an average of 13.88. His highest score of the season, and the highest of his career, was 45 against Essex at Brentwood. In 1952, Somerset had what Wisden termed \\"a disastrous season\\" and finished at the bottom of the County Championship. Lack of bowling penetration was the main problem, and Redman, who played in 17 Championship games, took only 33 wickets at the average of 35.39. There was only one outstanding performance: in the match against Gloucestershire at Taunton, he took seven wickets for 49 runs in a rain-spoilt match. Towards the end of the season, Redman lost his regular place in the side as the Cambridge University batsman Gerry Tordoff, who bowled a bit, came into the side. Redman left the Somerset staff at the end of the 1952 season. Redman played only three more times for Somerset as an amateur, all of them matches at the Bath cricket festival in 1953, and he bowled only 18 overs in these matches, taking just two further wickets. He did have a prominent role in one of the season's memorable matches, though: the game against Lancashire, designated as Bertie Buse's benefit match, was finished inside a single day on a terrible pitch. Somerset's two innings resulted in totals of 55 and 79, and the match lasted up till six o-clock on the first day only because of a second-innings last- wicket stand of 35 between Redman, who made an unbeaten 27 - the only other double-figure score in the match for Somerset was 14 by Harold Stephenson - and the 17-year-old Brian Langford. Redman took two wickets in this match but failed in the other two games at Bath, and did not play first-class cricket again. After first-class cricket Leaving professional cricket at the end of 1952, Redman went into business and later moved from Bath to Salisbury. He played a few matches for Wiltshire in the Minor Counties Championship between 1958 and 1964, and in the match against Somerset's Second Eleven in 1962, he made 112.

His ambitious literary debut, Alice in Verse: The Lost Rhymes of Wonderland,Quality Books Inc. Online Ordering offered a unique and refreshing take on Lewis Carroll's oft-adapted tale. Written entirely in rhyming verse, with a canny ear for Carroll's dialect, rhythm, and structure, the book follows Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (with \\"A Slight Detour Through the Looking-Glass\\"). Standing in contrast to his rhyming poetry is his first novel, The Boys From Manchester, a coming of age story that center on two teenage boys with superpowers. What sets The Boys From Manchester apart from other superhero novels (and movies) is the starkly realistic manner in which Holden approaches the subject matter, as a character-driven story that gradually builds into an explosive action tale in the final third of the book. That the main characters are gay teens who do not fall into stereotype and are not portrayed as victims but as heroes is a real step forward in Young Adult Fiction.

The creation of the Quarter Pounder earned him the nickname \\"Fremont's hamburger king.\\" Bernardin, during the 60’s, was McDonald's vice president of product development. His position allowed him to play a key role in the development of some of the company's signature menu items, including frozen french fries, which allowed for easier storage and transportation, as well as the McDonald's fish sandwich, apple pie and cherry pie. McDonald's Bernardin was born on February 17, 1928, in Lawrence, Massachusetts. He received his bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 1952. He was first hired to work at McDonald's Illinois corporate headquarters in 1960. Bernardin was promoted to dean of the company's training center, Hamburger University, within just six months of joining McDonald's. Development of the Quarter Pounder The Quarter Pounder, which was invented by Bernardin in 1971. Bernardin purchased two company-owned McDonald's in Fremont, California, and relocated to the city in 1970. He successfully expanded his McDonald's franchise business, eventually owning nine of the restaurants throughout southern Alameda County. Once in Fremont, Bernardin began experimenting with new menu items for his franchises. In 1971, Bernardin introduced the now famous Quarter Pounder at his McDonald's locations. He explained his idea for the Quarter Pounder in a 1991 interview marking the 20th anniversary of the burger's development saying, \\"felt there was a void in our menu vis-à-vis the adult who wanted a higher ratio of meat to bun.\\" Bernardin unveiled the Quarter Pounder using the slogan, \\"Today Fremont, tomorrow the world.\\" The Quarter Pounder is now one of McDonald's most popular signature items, having been added to the national American menu in 1973. Other McDonald's contributions Additionally, Bernardin worked as McDonald's vice president of product development during his career with the company. Though he was most famous for introducing the Quarter Pounder, Bernardin felt that his most important contribution to McDonald's and the larger fast food industry was the development of frozen french fries. Until 1967, all McDonald's french fries had to be cut on-site from stored potatoes and fried. Bernardin's frozen fries allowed for easier transport of the product and cleared storage space which was previously used for storing potatoes. He explained the benefits of frozen fries saying, \\"Before that, the (restaurants) had to store potatoes in the basement. It was a real pain.\\" As vice president, Bernardin also shepherded the development of the McDonald's Filet-O-Fish, as well the company's fried apple and cherry pies. Not all of Bernadin's suggestions were included on McDonald's menus. McDonald's turned down his idea for a ground turkey meat burger called the McGobbler. The company also dismissed his The Lite Mac sandwich, which would have consisted of a one fifth-pound burger patty containing 15% less beef fat than a normal Big Mac. Bernardin spent approximately two years developing a prototype for buttered corn-on-the-cob, according to his son, Mark Bernardin, who is also a McDonald's franchise owner. Later life Bernardin and his wife, Joan Bernardin, became involved in philanthropy after his uncle received treatment in a hospice. Impressed by his uncle's hospice care, Bernardin founded the Tree of Angels, a Christmas tree lighting festival designed to raise money for the Pathways Hospice, based in Sunnyvale, California. The couple moved to the Monterey, California, area in the mid-1990s, eventually settling in Pebble Beach. He spent time as a volunteer at hospices throughout northern California. Bernardin became a major benefactor for the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, known as CHOMP. In addition to his home in Pebble Beach, Bernardin also had residences in Pleasanton, California, Spanish Bay and Cape Cod. Bernardin suffered from a stroke later in his life. He died of complications of that stroke on December 22, 2009, at Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula in Monterey, California, at the age of 81. He was survived by his wife, Joan Bernardin, two children, Kirsten and Mark, three stepchildren, Dan Ryan, Julie Bullas, Kristie Ryan and ten grandchildren.

It follows Prehistoric Armenia and covers a period of approximately one thousand years, beginning at the end of the Iron Age with the events that led to the dissolution of the Kingdom of Urartu, and the emergence of the first geopolitical entity called Armenia in the 6th century BC. Highlights of this period include the rise of ancient Armenia as an important state in Western Asia in the 4th century BC; a briefly held empire under Julius Caesar's contemporary the Great King Tigranes II (\\"the Great\\"); the kingdom's official conversion to Christianity in 301;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/world/europe/armenian-apostolic-church- survivor-of-the-ages-faces-modern-hurdles.html and the creation of the Armenian alphabet in the year 405.https://www.britannica.com/topic/Armenian- alphabet It concludes with the demise of the Armenian kingdom and the country's partition later in the 5th century, marking the beginning of Medieval Armenia.  Prehistory  During the Iron Age, in the region the ancient Assyrians called Urartu (called Bianili by the Urartians themselves), various tribal confederations and kingdoms emerged; these groups included the Hayasa-Azzi, Shupria, Nairi, the Mushki, and possibly a group retroactively referred to as Armeno-Phryigians. In the 9th century BC, tribes from the vicinity of Lake Van established the Kingdom of Van (Urartian: Bianili) to defend the highlands from Assyria, effectively uniting the disparate tribes of the highlands into one realm and beginning the process of amalgamation of its peoples.Armen Asher The Peoples of Ararat. 2009, p. 290-291. . The kingdom ultimately collapsed in the 6th century BC at the hands of invading Medes, and a realm called \\"Armenia\\" emerged from the territory of the fallen kingdom shortly after.\\"Armenians\\" in Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture, edited by J. P. Mallory and Douglas Q. Adams, published in 1997 by Fitzroy Dearborn. As the Armenian identity developed in the region, the memory of Urartu faded and disappeared.Armen Asher The Peoples of Ararat. 2009, p. 291. . Parts of its history passed down as popular stories and were preserved in Armenia, as written by Movses Khorenatsi in the form of garbled legends in his 5th century book History of Armenia, where he speaks of a first Armenian Kingdom in Van which fought wars against the Assyrians. Khorenatsi's stories of these wars with Assyria would help in the rediscovery of Urartu.  Satrapy of Armenia  It is unclear where the exonym Armenia derived from; the earliest ever record that can confidently be considered Armenia appears in a trilingual Persian inscription as Armina in the Old Persian language and as Harminuya in the Elamite language, whereas the older name for the region, Urartu, was used in the Babylonian translation (see: Name of Armenia).  Orontid Dynasty  Armenia emerged as a kingdom under the Orontid dynasty ( Yervanduni) in 570 BC, but had become a subject of the Persian Empire in 553 BC, as a satrapy. This period was marked with several Armenian revolts and struggles to gain independence from the Persian Empire.  Kingdom of Armenia  The satrapy of Armenia became an independent kingdom in 321 BC, after the conquests of Alexander the Great, but soon became incorporated as one of the Hellenistic kingdoms of the Seleucid Empire.  Artaxiad Dynasty  The Artaxiad dynasty ( Artashesian) rose to power and replaced the Orontids as rulers of Armenia in 189 BC. During this time, Armenia was divided into several regions and kingdoms ruled by Armenian dynasties: * Armenia Major ( Mets Hayk), the main Armenian dominion. * Armenia Minor ( Pokr Hayk), also known as Lesser Armenia; initially ruled by the Orontid Dynasty, but later ruled by Persians and Romans. * Sophene ( Tsopk) * Commagene ( Kommagene) = Armenian Empire = During the eastern expansion of the Roman Empire, the Kingdom of Armenia, under Tigranes II ( Tigran B), extinguished the Seleucid Empire, and between 84 BC to 59 BC, extended Armenia to reach the largest size it would ever become in its history, stretching from the Caspian sea in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. Tigranes' empire was short-lived, however, as it would be defeated by Rome, after which the succeeding kings of Armenia ruled as Roman clients.  Arsacid Dynasty  Following the fall of the Armenian Empire, Armenia was contested between Rome and Parthia. For centuries, Armenia would find itself alternating between being independent, under Roman rule, and under Parthian rule (later Byzantine and Sassanian, respectively). During this period, the Artaxiad dynasty was overthrown by the Romans in 12 AD, and the Arsacid dynasty ( Arshakuni) rose to take their place as the rulers of Armenia in 54. Although the Arsacid dynasty ruled Armenia, it would continue to be contested between the Roman and Iranian empires. = Conversion to Christianity = In 301, Tiridates III ( Trdat III) proclaimed Christianity as the state religion of Armenia, making Armenia the first state to embrace Christianity as the official state religion. = Creation of the Armenian Alphabet = Until this time, Armenians were using Greek, Persian, and Syriac scripts to write. The rise of Christianity in Armenia brought the need to express the Armenian language more clearly, but as these scripts were not well suited for the Armenian language, it made preaching the Gospel difficult. This motivated a Christian theologian named Mesrop Mashtots () to invent the Armenian alphabet in 405 and facilitate the spread of Christianity within Armenia and the neighboring kingdoms which Armenia had influence over (Iberia and Albania).  Fall of Armenia  After the division of the Roman Empire into Western and Eastern empires, and the rise of the Sassanian dynasty in Iran, Armenia would be on the frontier of the Roman–Sasanian wars. This would ultimately lead to the partitioning of Armenia into Byzantine Armenia in 387 and Sassanian Armenia in 428, which would bring an end to the history of ancient Armenia, and begin the period of Medieval Armenia.

Early life A native of Schwallungen, Saxe- Meiningen, Kühnhold received his higher education in physics at the University of Göttingen. After graduating with a Ph.D. in physics in 1928, he took a position at the Nachrichtenmittel-Versuchsanstalt (NVA – Navy Transmissions Laboratory) of the Kriegsmarine (Germany Navy) in Kiel. There he worked in acoustical research, specifically in Unterwasser-Schall (sonar) with the objective of improving the accuracy of detection of vessels using near- surface, underwater signals. Although his efforts led to a patent, and in 1931, he was promoted to Scientific Director of the NVA, he became convinced that the desired accuracy would only be attained by using electromagnetic, rather than acoustical, techniques. Radar research=Background The first demonstration of radio signals for detecting ships was made in 1904 by Christian Hülsmeyer, with an apparatus called the Telemobilskop (Telemobiloscope). This device, however, could neither distinguish between multiple targets nor directly measure the distance to a target, and was thus not accepted as of practical value. Other similar sets had come forth in the intervening decades, but none were successful. Kühnhold’s approach Kühnhold’s analytical studies indicated that a very narrow beam could solve the multiple-target problem. In 1933, he obtain transmitting and receiving sets operating at 13.5 cm (2.22 GHz), both units using Barkhausen-Kurz tubes. A reflecting target was set up at 2-km distance. The transmitter produced only 0.1 watt – too small for the 4-km total path – and the experiment failed. For further experiments, Kühnhold turned to Paul-Gunther Erbsloh and Hans-Karl von Willisen, amateur radio operators who had started a project in a narrow-beam, VHF system for secure communications. For the effort, In January 1934, Erbsloh and von Willisen, with backing from Kühnhold, formed a new company – Gesellschaft für Electroakustische und Mechanische Apparate. From the start, this firm was always called simply GEMA.Kroge, Harry von; GEMA: Birthplace of German Radar and Sonar’’, translated by Louis Brown, Inst. of Physics Publishing, 2000 A split-anode magnetron, producing 70 W at 50 cm (600 MHz) was purchased from the Philips Research Laboratory in the Netherlands. Hans E. Hollmann and Jakob Theodor J. Schultes, both affiliated with the prestigious Heinrich Hertz Institute in Berlin, were added as consultants for developing a regenerative receiver and Yagi antennas, respectively. The transmitting and receiving antennas were set up some distance apart. In June 1934, large vessels passing through the Kiel Harbor were detected by Doppler interference at a distance of about 2 km. The apparatus had poor reliability of detection due to frequency instability of the magnetron, a characteristic of all early split-anode devices. Partnership with GEMA Kühnhold worked closely with GEMA and led their attempts to improve the continuous-wave system, but also retained his position at the NVA. In October 1934, strong reflections were observed from an aircraft that happened to fly through the beam; this opened consideration of targets other than ships and brought funding from NVA. At that time, the success of a number of researchers in using pulsed-transmission for measuring the height of the ionosphere was well known. Also, underwater acoustical detection used pulsed transmission. Thus, Kühnhold and the GEMA team turned their attention to developing a pulsed radio system for combined detection and range determination. Their pulsed system used a new Philips magnetron with better frequency stability. It was modulated with 2-ms pulses at a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 2000 Hz. The transmitting antenna was an array of 10 pairs of dipoles with a reflecting mesh. The wide-band regenerative circuit used Acorn triodes from RCA, and the receiving antenna had three pairs of dipoles and incorporated lobe switching. A blocking device shut the receiver input when the transmitter pulsed. For displaying the range, it had a Braun tube (a CRT), improved in the late 1920s by Manfred von Ardenne. The equipment was placed atop a tower at a NVA test facility beside the Lubecker Bay near Pelzerhaken. This pulse-modulated system first detected returns from woods across the bay at a range of 15 km in May 1935, but had limited success detecting a ship only a short distance out on the bay. The receiver was rebuilt, becoming a superheterodyne set, and the system then tracked vessels at up to 8-km range. Demonstration In September 1935, Kühnhold led a demonstration of his system given to the Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine. The equipment performance was excellent, and the apparatus was given the code name Dezimeter-Telegraphie or simply DeTe. From this time onward, GEMA had total responsibility for additional development of the system. The basic DeTe eventually evolved into the Seetakt for the Kriegsmarine and the Freya for the Luftwaffe (German Air Force); these popular sets were used throughout the war. Kühnhold remained with the NVA and also consulted for GEMA; he is often credited in Germany as being the inventor of radar. During 1936 and 1937, in a rare cooperative activity between the services, Kühnhold and the NVA worked with Hans Plendl on Knickebein (Bent Leg) and other radio navigation systems at the Luftwaffe’s Laboratory for Aviation. Just before the beginning of the war and for a while thereafter, some research on microwave devices was continued by Kühnhold at the NVA (in 1939 renamed Nachrichtenmittel-versuchskommando – NVK). Aside from this, little further work on microwave systems was done in Germany until after early 1943 when a British multi-cavity magnetron was found in a downed RAF bomber. A commission was formed to assess this device, but Kühnhold and Hollmann, the two scientists who likely knew more about magnetrons than anyone else in Germany, were not included. Post-war career For the remainder of the war, most of Kühnhold’s research at the NVK was in underwater acoustic techniques, working closely with the firm ELAC in Kiel. Founded in 1926, ELAC was the primary supplier of echo-sounding (sonar) equipment for the Kriegsmarine, with a staff that peaked near 5,000. When the war ended in May 1945, the NVK was closed, and ELAC was restricted to commercial audio products and reduced to a small number of employees. In 1948, the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany relaxed restrictions on ELAC and the firm formed a Nautik Division for the design and production of nautical equipment. Kühnhold joined ELAC and initiated research in commercial radar. His work there resulted in patents, included one registered in the United States in 1954.\\"Absorption device for electro-magnetic waves\\" http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2771602.pdf ELAC had major financial problems, resulting in selling its Nautik Division and ending Kühnhold’s professional career in the 1960s.

His work centers on logic, philosophy of language and philosophy of morality. He believes in multiple modernities and seeks to establish an ethical and humanitarian modernity based on the values and principles of Islam and the Arab tradition. Early life and education He was born in 1944 and raised in El Jadida (province of El Jadida) there he went to basic school, after that he moved to Casablanca where he continued his high school, and then he joined the Mohammed V University (Rabat, Morocco) where he obtained his licentiate in philosophy. He completed his studies at the university of Sorbonne where he received his second licentiate and obtained his doctoral third level in the year of 1972 on the subject: \\"Language and philosophy: a study of the linguistic structures of ontology\\", and in 1985 he earned his Ph.D in the philosophy on the subject \\"study of argumentation and its methods\\" (in French: Essai sur les logiques des raisonnements argumentatifs et naturels, literally \\"Essay on the logic of reasoning argumentatives and naturals\\").

Background He was born in Rathmines, Dublin on 15 August 1894, as the second son of an American citizen Mary Yore and the Fenian and Land Leaguer Michael Davitt. His early influences towards equality for all were well founded in the struggles of Hazen Stuart Pingree, Alexander Macomb (Holmes) and subsequently influenced by the James Riddle Hoffa movement. He studied at St Michael's Christian Brothers, Dún Laoghaire, Presentation Brothers Glasthule and O’Connells CBS in Dublin and continued his education at University College Dublin and the King's Inns, being called to the Bar in January 1916. Military service During the Irish War of Independence (1919–21) Davitt was appointed as a Dáil Courts 'Judge' in 1920 and sat on cases throughout the country while evading British Forces. Following the July 1921 Truce, Hugh Kennedy, then legal adviser to the Provisional Government, said he had been directed on behalf of the Government to ask Davitt if he would consider taking the new post of Judge-Advocate General. Davitt was granted time to consider and on reflection recognised it as a duty, despite the clear difficulties entailed in enacting a system of discipline with a changing army, discipline which Michael Collins told him he was anxious about, and of being responsible for the conduct of Courts-martial, of which he knew little. This became contentious on the outbreak of the Irish Civil War (1922–23) and Davitt was critical of what he referred to as ‘drumhead’ courts-martial: on one occasion he prevented the execution of a civilian spy convicted by a military court in Cathal Brugha barracks by pointing out that shooting him would be murder in law, and might be prosecuted as such if the other side won. He also confirmed, with Adjutant-General Gearoid O'Sullivan, a prima facie case against G.O.C. Kerry Command Paddy O'Daly and two other officers in the Kenmare incident, providing a way for Minister for Defence Richard Mulcahy to cover his indecision. Davitt was responsible for drafting the first manual of regulations for the Free State Army and is credited with laying the foundations for what was to become the Army Legal Services. Judicial career He was appointed as an assistant Circuit Court Judge in November 1926 and then a few months later in 1927 as a full Circuit Court Judge. He was a judge on the Great Southern Railways Stocks transactions Tribunal from 1943 to 1944, which was chaired by Mr. Justice Andrew Kingsbury Overend of the High Court. He was appointed to the High Court in 1945, and became President of the High Court in 1951, an office he held until his retirement in 1966. He died on 1 March 1986.

The most notable battles were fought on May 13–15, 1948, between the Palmach and the Egyptian army, including Muslim Brotherhood units. The kibbutz was defended by about 30 Israelis and held out against numerous attacks. While Egyptian assaults were unsuccessful, their siege led to the evacuation of the kibbutz by its members on July 8, 1948, after resupply attempts through the ground and air by the Israeli Negev Brigade and air force were insufficient or failed entirely. The Egyptian army stormed it the next day only to find it empty. Background Kfar Darom was originally a fruit orchard established in 1930 by the citrus grower Tuvia Miller, located far from the rest of the Jewish population of the British Mandate of Palestine. It was destroyed in the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. The village was re-established as part of the 11 points in the Negev plan, a response to the Morrison–Grady Plan for the partition of Palestine. On October 6, 1946 new olim left Be'erot Yitzhak to create Kfar Darom, Be'eri and Tkuma. Kfar Darom was strategically located on the coastal road that the Egyptians would later use as their main advance and supply route. 1947–1948 Palestine War While all Jewish villages in the Negev were isolated to some degree and therefore comparatively easy targets, during the 1947–1948 war in mandatory Palestine, Kfar Darom bore the brunt of the Arab attacks. First shots were fired at the village on December 7, 1947. By this time the village was under siege and military effort was required to get supplies through. The situation deteriorated and by April 1948, Kfar Darom was completely surrounded by Arab forces. The first significant Arab attempt to capture Kfar Darom was on March 23, 1948, when 18 separate attacks were repelled by the local residents. Shots were again heard on April 8. On April 10, a Muslim Brotherhood's First Battalion under Husni al-Musawi staged an attack on the village, but was defeated with dozens of casualties. The next attempt was made by the Brotherhood on May 10 under Lieutenant Colonel (Bikbashi) Ahmad al-Aziz. Aziz sent reconnaissance patrols on May 10, and on the next day, assaulted the village. He hoped that a one-hour artillery barrage would kill or wound most of the defenders, but it was mostly off- target and failed to destroy any building. Three infantry and armoured thrusts were repelled, as they were allowed to come close to the village fence unmolested, and concentrated fire was opened at them when they did, causing confusion. The sappers who were meant to breach the fence were all killed or wounded and the force could not advance further and retreated, leaving 70 dead. In Kfar Darom, four were killed and four wounded, leaving a total of 25 able to fight. Battles of May 13–15 Battles were renewed on the night of May 12, when a Muslim Brotherhood infantry contingent breached the eastern fence of Kfar Darom. They entered into a minefield and withdrew. A lone tank broke through the gate but had to stop at a communications trench. It was torched with Molotov cocktails and withdrew as well. At this point the kibbutz was defended by 30 members, of them 20 Palmach soldiers from the Negev Brigade. After two reinforcement attempts before Egyptian intervention failed (one of them because of a \\"rebellion\\" by Palmach squad commanders who refused to lead new recruits), the Negev Brigade planned a major breakthrough with a reinforced company with several armored vehicles. The plan was to capture the Bedouin locality Khirbat Ma'in and get a convoy through to Kfar Darom during the night of May 14–15. The attack was delayed and Khirbat Ma'in was only taken at dawn. The vehicles proceeded in daylight to Kfar Darom, but got bogged down in sand away from the village, and came under fire from Muslim Brotherhood forces. All vehicles were abandoned except one, which managed to reach Kfar Darom fully intact. Many of the troops from the abandoned vehicles made it to Kfar Darom on foot, but carried 39 wounded, which only made the fighting more difficult for the besieged. Food and water rations now had to be divided among more people. The Egyptian regular army staged its attack on the morning of May 15. Forces from the 1st Battalion including three tanks, six armored vehicles, 10 other vehicles and an infantry contingent attacked Kfar Darom from the Deir al-Balah railway station in the northwest. They were met with anti-tank fire and retreated after one tank was hit. The Egyptian infantry pushed on, but was repelled and failed to breached the perimeter. The Egyptian losses amounted to 70 killed and 50 wounded. All the while, Egyptian aircraft made bombing runs on the village. After the ground troops reorganized, they made a final thrust to rescue to wounded left in the field, and a heavy artillery barrage on the village followed. Siege and evacuation Residents of Kfar Darom during the war By the first truce of the war on June 11, Kfar Darom was completely surrounded and under siege by Egyptian forces. Numerous attempts were made before and during the truce, including aerial drops, to deliver food and supplies to the village. The United Nations ceasefire observers did not intervene, and Egypt prevented the besieged kibbutz from receiving aid, including by shelling the areas where aerial drops landed, so that they could not be picked up. One convoy from the Negev Brigade managed to enter the village, but were subjected to Egyptian fire when trying to get back. After 8 days, they finally managed to take a few wounded and make it back to the Israeli lines. In light of the situation, the Negev Brigade requested permission to evacuate Kfar Darom. Although they would be sacrificing a strategic asset (a position that overlooked the coastal road, which was Egypt's main supply route) and deviating from the principle prevalent at that time in Israel that no settlement would be evacuated, the brigade wished to consolidate its positions, and Kfar Darom was a major burden. The General Staff agreed, and an order was given to abandon the village on July 8. It was evacuated under cover of darkness with all the weapons possible to carry, as well as the two Torah scrolls; other supplies were destroyed. Egypt's army attacked on July 9 with infantry, armor and artillery, but were surprised to find the village deserted. Reactions and aftermath The initial stand of Kfar Darom on May 13–15 lifted the morale of all Israeli forces, as it was considered the first successful Jewish stand against the Arab standing armies (Gush Etzion had fallen to the Transjordanian Arab Legion several days earlier). The land of Kfar Darom remained under Egyptian control following the 1949 Armistice Agreements, and became part of the Gaza Strip. Some of the kibbutz members helped found Bnei Darom in 1949, near today's Ashdod. The Gaza Strip was captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War, and in 1970, a Nahal settlement was built next to the old Kfar Darom. It was civilianized in October 1989. On August 18, 2005, Kfar Darom was evacuated as part of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan.

In 1888 she was the first woman to be appointed as a teacher in an English boys' public school, at Rugby School. The Phonetic Journal, September 1891 and the journal, Birmingham Faces And Places, September 1892, both credit her with being the first female reporter in England.\\"Reporter\\" has been used in the context of one who accurately records lectures, addresses, sermons, speeches and other verbal discourses. Marie Bethell Beauclerc first used her shorthand skills professionally in 1863 and during the early 1870s she worked as a shorthand reporter for George Dawson, editor of The Birmingham Morning News. She was officially recognised as the first female reporter in England in 1891. Harriet Martineau (1802–1876), sociologist and author of many books, wrote several newspaper and journal articles on her chosen subject and is thus sometimes referred to as a journalist. Early life Marie Bethell Beauclerc was born in London in 1845 as Maria Bethell. When she was around four years old, she and her older twin siblings Richard and Elizabeth, were sent from London to a boarding school near Bath. By this time Maria Bethell's surname and the surname of her siblings, had been changed to Beauclerc. The children's father, Richard Bethell, died when Maria was five years old however the reason for the name change of Maria, Richard and Elizabeth from Bethell to Beauclerc is unknown. Maria Beauclerc attended Weston Boarding Schools near Bath until circumstances forced her to leave school at age nine. At age twelve she began teaching herself shorthand from a manual which she found in some waste paper. The manual entitled The Phonographic Teacher, was written by Isaac Pitman (knighted in 1894). On her thirteenth birthday, Maria Beauclerc and her mother moved to Birmingham where she continued her studies through a member of the Phonetic Society in Bath who corrected her exercises through the post. The addition of Bethell to the name Beauclerc appeared for the first time in the title of a biography entitled Marie Bethell Beauclerc in The Phonetic Journal Sept. 1891. Reporter In 1863, at the age of eighteen, Maria Beauclerc was engaged for two months as shorthand amanuensis to a phrenological lecturer visiting Birmingham. Later George Dawson (1821–1876), editor of the Birmingham Morning News between 1871 and 1873, also engaged Maria Beauclerc because of her outstanding shorthand reporting skills. The appointment of a female reporter by the Birmingham Morning News was extraordinary as it was the first time in England that a female had been engaged by a newspaper as a shorthand reporter. Maria Beauclerc became professionally known as Marie Beauclerc and her work at the Birmingham Morning News included the reporting of many public meetings, conferences and lectures. At this time, shorthand was still a male dominated expertise however from approximately 1865 until Dawson's sudden death in 1876, Marie Beauclerc also recorded most of the content of the nine volumes of Dawson's lectures, prayers and sermons. Four volumes were published after Dawson's death. George St. Clair, the editor of these volumes, acknowledges in the prefaces that \\"The discourses are mostly from the shorthand reports of Miss Marie Beauclerc.\\"George Dawson, Every-Day Counsels (London, 1888) A similar preface reads, \\"When a lecture is reported by Miss Beauclerc – as is the case with the one on the Shadow of Death – we have a near approach to fulness and accuracy\\". Further on St. Clair adds, \\"I have had, as before, the invaluable help of Miss Beauclerc in collating and transcribing.\\"George Dawson, Shakespeare and Other Lectures (London, 1888) Marie Beauclerc is also credited in prefaces of volumes of work by author and preacher Christopher J. Street (1855–1931). When Unitarian clergyman and lecturer, Robert Collyer (1823–1912), visited Birmingham from the United States, he engaged Marie Beauclerc to report and edit his sermons and prayers which were delivered at Newhall Hill Church Birmingham on 2 September 1883 and published during the same year. Teacher In 1874 the Perry Barr Institute, the first suburban institute in Birmingham was established and Marie Beauclerc was appointed a teacher of phonography. She held her position at this institute for fourteen years until 1888. Marie Beauclerc was also engaged in teaching phonography when it was introduced at the Birmingham and Midland Institute in 1876. \\"Thousands of pupils have passed through the hands of Miss Beauclerc, in connection with this institute alone; and many young men owe their start in life to the knowledge they have thus gained\\". \\"In 1888, Miss Beauclerc was accorded the high honour of the appointment of Teacher of Shorthand at Rugby School\\". This was the first time shorthand had been taught in an English public school and the first appointment of a female teacher in an English boys' public school. There were one hundred boys in her classes and Dr. Percival, headmaster at this time \\"expressed his satisfaction at the excellence of the teaching and the progress made by the pupils\\". Beauclerc also taught senior boys at the Birmingham Blue Coat School and in addition to achieving as a female teacher of predominately male students in the fields of shorthand and typing, Beauclerc was a teacher of dancing and callisthenics. Marie Bethell Beauclerc Phonetic Journal Sept. 1891 Pioneer In 1887, Marie Beauclerc established a Shorthand Writers Association and \\"officially introduced the art of typewriting to Birmingham\\".The Phonetic Journal Sept. 1891Birmingham Faces and Places May 1893 Also in 1887, Beauclerc delivered a paper at the International Shorthand Congress and Phonographic Jubilee in London. Her paper, entitled Phonography in Birmingham, illustrates her passion for her pioneering work and is contained in the printed Transactions of the Congress held by the Pitman Library at the University of Bath. In England at this time, shorthand and typing were still male domains with few places available for female students and few employment opportunities for females. Marie Beauclerc's pioneering work in the fields of shorthand and typing, benefited the progress of Birmingham's business and cultural community, while her example and the discussion she generated, (e.g. International Congress) helped pave the way for the explosion of female stenography in the 20th century. In 1892, Beauclerc now known as Marie Bethell Beauclerc, retired from teaching at the Birmingham and Midland Institute. Her retirement was due to illness, however, she continued to edit Sunday Evening Lectures by James C. Street \\"during her short intervals of ease\\". Death Marie Bethell Beauclerc died on 19 September 1897. She is buried at Key Hill Cemetery, Birmingham, two plots away from George Dawson.

Uppland Runic Inscription 308 or U 308 is the Rundata catalog designation for a memorial runestone that is located in Ekeby, Stockholm County, Sweden, which was in the historic province of Uppland. While the tradition of carving inscriptions into boulders began in the 4th century and lasted into the 12th century, most runestones date from the late Viking Age. Description This inscription is carved on a rock that is north-west of Skånela Church and consists of a Christian cross surrounded by a runic text within a serpent band. The inscription is about 1.2 meters tall by 1 meters wide. The runic text indicates that it was carved by Þorgautr, which is often normalized as Torgöt, and states that he is the son of the runemaster Fot, who was an active runemaster in southern Uppland during the late Viking Age.Project Samnordisk Runtextdatabas Svensk - Rundata entry for U 308. Two other surviving runestones listed in the Rundata catalog, U 746 in Hårby and U 958 in Villinge, are listed as being signed by Þorgautr, and several others are attributed either to him based on stylistic analysis. This runestone is considered to be similar in style to those carved by Þorgautr's father, Fot, and is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which is also known as the Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. The runic text states that that stone was raised by a man named Gunni in memory of himself. There are over twenty other runestones in which the sponsor states that the stone was raised in memory of himself, including Sö 55 in Bjudby, U 127 in Danderyds, the now-lost U 149 in Hagby, U 164 and U 165 in Täby, U 171 in Söderby, U 194 in Väsby, U 212 in Vallentuna, U 261 in Fresta, the now-lost U 345 in Yttergärde, U 433 in Husby-Ärlinghundra, U 734 in Linsunda, U 739 in Gådi, U 803 in Långtora, U 962 in Vaksala, U 1011 in Örby, U 1040 in Fasma, the now-lost U 1114 in Myrby, U 1181 in Lilla Runhällen, U Fv1958;250 in Sigtuna, Vs 17 in Råby, Vs 32 in Prästgården, and DR 212 in Tillitse. Of these, five stones known as the Jarlabanke Runestones were sponsored by the same person in memory of himself. The name Þorgautr contains the Norse pagan god Thor as a theophoric name element and means \\"Thor-Goth.\\" Inscription=Transliteration of the runes into Latin characters :kuni lit rista runaʀ þisar eftʀ sik * kuikhan þurhkutr * risti runa þisar fots arfi Transcription into Old Norse :Gunni lét rista rúnar þessar eptir sik kvikvan.

Known as Piney Branch Road, the highway runs from Eastern Avenue at the District of Columbia boundary in Takoma Park north to MD 650 in Adelphi. MD 320 is a southwest-northeast highway that connects Takoma Park and Silver Spring in southeastern Montgomery County with Adelphi in far western Prince George's County. The state highway originally extended from downtown Silver Spring to White Oak and connected with U.S. Route 29 (US 29) at both ends. The Silver Spring-Adelphi portion of the highway was constructed by 1910. The segment through Takoma Park and the Adelphi-White Oak segment, which later became MD 650, were built in the early 1930s; the Takoma Park portion was built as MD 513. MD 320 was widened over its whole length in the late 1940s and reduced to its present course in the mid-1950s. Route description View north along MD 320 at MD 193 in Silver Spring MD 320 southbound at Manchester Road in Silver Spring MD 320 begins at the intersection of Piney Branch Road and Eastern Avenue at the District of Columbia boundary in the city of Takoma Park. Piney Branch Road continues southwest into Washington, where it immediately passes under CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision and the Washington Metro's Red Line. Eastern Avenue provides access to the Takoma station on the Red Line and the Takoma Park Historic District to the southeast; the street also leads to the Takoma Park/Silver Spring campus of Montgomery College to the northwest. MD 320 heads northeast as a narrow two-lane undivided road. The highway expands as it veers north at one-way Chestnut Avenue and intersects MD 410 (Philadelphia Avenue). The highway curves northeast and gains a center turn lane as it leaves the city of Takoma Park and passes west of Takoma Park Middle School. MD 320 parallels the city limits to Mississippi Avenue, where the highway fully enters the unincorporated area of Silver Spring. MD 320 intersects Sligo Avenue and Dale Drive, then descends into the valley of Sligo Creek. The highway crosses the creek and intersects Sligo Creek Parkway and the Sligo Creek Trail. At the top of its climb out of the creek valley, MD 320 intersects Flower Avenue, which was formerly MD 787. The highway continues east as a four-lane road with center turn lane, crossing Long Branch before intersecting MD 193 (University Boulevard). Beyond MD 193, MD 320 descends into the valley of Northwest Branch. The highway meets the northern end of Carroll Avenue, which leads south to MD 195. MD 320 crosses the Montgomery- Prince George's County line and crosses Northwest Branch before it reaches its northern terminus at MD 650 (New Hampshire Avenue) in Adelphi. History MD 320 originally had its southern terminus at the intersection of US 29 and Sligo Avenue in Silver Spring. The highway followed Sligo Avenue east to Piney Branch Road, then followed Piney Branch Road northeast to Adelphi. MD 320 continued roughly along what is now New Hampshire Road to its northern terminus at US 29, which is now the intersection of MD 650 and Lockwood Drive in White Oak. The portion of this highway from modern US 29 to Carroll Avenue was paved by Montgomery County with state aid as a macadam road by 1910. Sligo Avenue was widened with a pair of concrete shoulders in 1926. MD 320 was extended north as a macadam road from Carroll Avenue through Prince George's County to White Oak in 1931 and 1932. The portion of MD 320 south of Sligo Avenue was built in two segments. The first segment, from the District of Columbia to Chestnut Avenue just south of MD 410, was a concrete reconstruction of Saratoga Avenue. The second segment, from Chestnut Avenue to Sligo Avenue, was a concrete road built on a new alignment. Both segments were constructed in 1931 and 1932 and were designated MD 513. MD 513 was widened with a pair of bituminous shoulders from MD 410 toward Sligo Avenue in 1942. MD 320 was expanded to a width of and resurfaced over its entire length in 1947 and 1948. MD 320's bridge across Long Branch was widened in 1953 and 1954. The highway's bridge across Northwest Branch at the MD 650 junction, which had originally been built in 1910, was widened in 1954 and 1955. MD 320 was placed on its present course in 1955; its northern end was truncated at MD 650. Its southern portion was moved from Sligo Avenue and replaced MD 513 through Takoma Park; Sligo Avenue was redesignated MD 339. MD 339 was removed from the state highway system by 1999.

Early life Verney was born at Little Chelsea, the only surviving son of John Verney, 1st Viscount Fermanagh and his first wife Elizabeth Palmer, the eldest daughter of Ralph Palmer, and was baptised in Kensington. He was educated at Mrs Morland's school at Hackney from around 1695 to 1700 and matriculated at Merton College, Oxford in 1700. He married Catherine Paschall, eldest daughter of Henry Paschall of Baddow, Essex at St Giles in the Fields on 24 February 1708. Career Verney succeeded his father as viscount and took his seat in the Irish House of Lords on 23 June 1717. The latter title was in the Peerage of Ireland and thus didn't prevent him from entering the British House of Commons. He was returned unopposed as Tory Member of Parliament for Amersham at a by-election on 10 July 1717. In 1719, he voted against the repeal of the Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts and the Peerage Bill. At the 1722 British general election, he was returned again unopposed as MP for Amersham.

Preston and in the office of William Ware in Boston. He began independent work in 1878 and became part of the Koehler & Hammond firm for a year, bringing him to Cleveland in 1885 to work on the Hollenden Hotel. He moved to Cleveland in 1886. He was active in Cleveland until 1926.George F. Hammond Encyclopedia of Cleveland History Hammond lived at 1863 Caldwell Road in Cleveland Heights.George F. Hammond City planning Commission City of Cleveland He designed hospitals, schools, factories, and power buildings in Chicago, Kansas City, New Orleans, Toronto, and Montreal. Hammond's home in Cleveland Heights is \\"a fine Colonial Revival residence\\". Hammond designed several suburban homes, especially in the Clifton Park area of Lakewood and published A Treatise on Hospital and Asylum Construction in 1891. Hollenden Hotel Liberty E. Holden commissioned Hammond to design the 8-story Hollenden Hotel in Cleveland, one of the area's first hotels to be made fire resistant. It was said to have been outfitted handsomely with \\"massive redwood and mahogany fittings\\", exclusively designed furniture, a crystal dining room that politicians used as a meeting place. It \\"boasted electric lights, 100 private baths, and fireproof construction\\" Encyclopedia of Cleveland Much of the interior design work was overseen by Hammond. The hotel was said to have had the longest bar in town, and to have been a meeting place for precinct workers, when it was not hosting \\"colorful balls and festivities\\". Five presidents, McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, Taft, Wilson and Harding, and many other dignitaries and celebrities stayed at the hotel.

With the decline of downtown Cleveland it became unprofitable in the 1980s and closed permanently in 1989. John W. Galbreath built a 32-story office building on the site. Hammond wrote an article in Concrete-cement Age, \\"An Unusual Work in Concrete and Stone\\", about his application of Egyptian architecture in his design work at the Hammend Hotel in Cleveland. He originally wanted the foyer by the elevator on each floor to represent a different country, but eventually the plan was not adopted, but the basement foyer was modeled after it and made to imitate \\"red Syrene granite\\" architecture of Egypt. The article is illustrated with a view of the hotel's basement elevator foyer showing the completed work carried out by The George Rackle & Sons Co. of Cleveland including columns types Hammond said were found at Egypt's Philae temple, as well as panels featuring Isis and Osiris sculpted by Jirouch of Fisher and Jirouch Co.

They have released two independent EPs. The band consists of Mike Hogan, Jon Scholl, Andrew Gaultier, Chris Jones, and Buck Langston. Brian Ireland, John Viavattine, Derek DeBlieux, and Brad Ourso are former members. After a stint in Los Angeles, California, Startisan now officially operates from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Startisan has played with bands including Switchfoot, Daughtry, Theory Of A Deadman, Seether, and Gavin DeGraw. History Streamline began in Rochester in 2003 with vocalist/guitarist Mike Hogan and keyboardist Jon Scholl. The two were later joined by bassist John Viavattine and the group eventually moved to Los Angeles. It was in Los Angeles that Streamline met veteran drummer Brian Ireland of Something Corporate. Ireland was arriving at the studio for the first day of recording drum tracks for former Something Corporate guitarist William Tell's 2007 debut album, You Can Hold Me Down, when he ran into Hogan and Scholl, who were leaving the same studio. In a 2008 interview, Ireland said, \\"They knew who I was. Later they phoned me at the studio and asked if I would sit in and do a drumming session ... It was for 'All I Need.' I was so impressed with them. They are great players and have a real sensibility for music.\\" Ireland recorded the track with the group and in December 2006, it was announced that he would be joining the band's official line-up. Meanwhile, guitarist Brad Ourso moved from Baton Rouge to Los Angeles. Ourso joined a pop-rock band called On The Surface, which features Ireland's then-girlfriend Heather Fogarty as vocalist. Through this connection, Ourso met Hogan and the two hit it off. In 2007, Ourso left On The Surface to join Streamline. \\"He left their band maybe two weeks after I broke up with her,\\" Ireland said. \\"He came over and jammed with us one day, which was supposed to be an innocent jam session, and it ended up in him calling my ex-girlfriend to tell her he was leaving the band.\\" Streamline's self-titled EP was named Best EP of 2007 by The Album Project and featured as part of AbsolutePunk's Unsigned Showcase. In 2008, Streamline moved their base of operations to Baton Rouge. The band has cited the desire to increase the ease of touring both the east and west coasts among the reasons for the move. In April 2009, Streamline released their second EP, The Alchemist and the Arsonist. In Nov. 2009, Ireland and Ourso left Streamline. In 2010, Streamline announced that they would be playing three shows as part of the South by Southwest (SXSW) music festival in Austin, Texas. As of January 5, 2011 Streamline has changed their name to Startisan and is planning on releasing a full-length album.

It is what lets you reach out and grab something, for instance, but it also, and more importantly, allows for the possibility of changing your point of view. This helps you differentiate one thing from another by the experience of moving around it, seeing new aspects of it (often referred to as making the absent present and the present absent), and still retaining the notion that this is the same thing that you saw other aspects of just a moment ago (it is identical). Your body is also experienced as a duality, both as object (you can touch your own hand) and as your own subjectivity (you are being touched). Empathy refers to the experience of another human body as another subjectivity: In one sense, you see another body, but what you immediately perceive or experience is another subject. In Husserl's original account, this was done by a sort of apperception built on the experiences of your own lived-body. The experience of your own body as your own subjectivity is then applied to the experience of another's body, which, through apperception, is constituted as another subjectivity. You can thus recognise the Other's intentions, emotions, etc. This experience of empathy is important in the phenomenological account of intersubjectivity. In phenomenology, intersubjectivity is what constitutes objectivity (i.e., what you experience as objective is experienced as being intersubjectively available - available to all other subjects. This does not imply that objectivity is reduced to subjectivity nor does it imply a relativist position, cf. for instance intersubjective verifiability). In the experience of intersubjectivity, one also experiences oneself as being a subject among other subjects, and one experiences oneself as existing objectively for these Others; one experiences oneself as the noema of Others' noeses, or as a subject in another's empathic experience. As such, one experiences oneself as objectively existing subjectivity. Intersubjectivity is also a part in the constitution of one's lifeworld, especially as \\"homeworld.\\" References Category:Phenomenology Category:Self ","title":"Lived body"},{"id":"25786009","text":"Penedo is a district in the Itatiaia municipality, located in the southern region of Rio de Janeiro state, in Brazil.

They took place in the sparsely populated Nazko area of the Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada starting on October 9, 2007 and ending on June 12, 2008. They occurred just west of Nazko Cone, a small tree-covered cinder cone that last erupted about 7,200 years ago. No damage or casualties resulted from the Nazko earthquakes, which were too small to be felt by people, but local seismographs recorded them. The earthquake swarm occurred at the eastern end of a known volcanic zone called the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This is an east-west trending line of volcanic formations extending from the Central Coast to the Central Interior of British Columbia.  Geology  The 2007–2008 Nazko earthquake swarm is interpreted to have originated below the surface. The character of the seismic waves indicated that the swarm originated from a magmatic source. It could have formed as a result of rock fracturing at the tip of a dike and/or by movement along fault planes due to changes in the local stress field by the expansion and movement of magma. This magmatic activity is potentially linked to the hypothesized Anahim hotspot, a mantle plume that is probably responsible for older volcanism throughout the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This volcanic belt includes the Rainbow, Ilgachuz and Itcha range shield volcanoes west of the Nazko swarm. Individual Anahim volcanoes generally become older to the west of the Nazko swarm, indicating that the North American Plate is moving in a westerly direction with respect to the hotspot, carrying the volcanoes along with it at a rate of to per year. Because the area where the 2007–2008 Nazko earthquake swarm originated is at the eastern end of the volcanic belt, it probably represents the youngest portion of the hotspot track. This suggests any future volcanic earthquakes will occur in the Nazko region or further to the east. The extent of the Anahim Volcanic Belt, including the Rainbow, Ilgachuz and Itcha shield volcanoes. The 2007–2008 Nazko earthquakes occurred roughly between the Itcha Range and Nazko Cone. Before the Nazko earthquake swarm began in 2007, the Anahim hotspot was not known to be an earthquake zone. On October 10 of the following year, a swarm of earthquakes occurred. These earthquakes were normally no more than magnitude 1.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, but at least one earthquake was as strong as magnitude 3.9. Since the appearance of the Nazko swarm, Natural Resources Canada has expressed interest in the adjacent 7,200‑year‑old Nazko Cone. Even though earthquake swarms can be dangerous, scientists are able to model such events to analyze their structure. During the earthquake swarm in 2007, a group of scientists investigated the possibility that a volcanic eruption would occur. Five additional seismographs were placed in the earthquake zone, and scientists closely monitored the seismic activity. After additional data were gathered, scientists with the United States Geological Survey, the University of Washington, and other organizations, agreed that the Nazko earthquakes probably originated from movement of magma beneath the surface near Nazko Cone. However, because of the number and small size of the Nazko earthquakes, no volcanic eruption is likely. Other recent earthquakes in North America that have been attributed to magma but did not result in a volcanic eruption include the 2003 earthquakes under Lake Tahoe in the U.S. state of California and a 2004 earthquake swarm at Jordan Craters in the U.S. state of Oregon. Number of earthquakes Overlapped cyan circles indicate the locations of earthquakes that were associated with the Nazko swarm. More than 1,000 earthquakes were recorded by regional seismic networks within three weeks of October 20, 2007. Because the seismometers that recorded the Nazko swarm were more than away from where the earthquakes took place, the locations of the hypocenters were measured with poor resolution. Following the earthquake, five seismometers were placed by the Geological Survey of Canada from September 2007 to June 2008 close to the hypocenter. Analysis of the data recorded by these seismometers indicates a much larger total number of earthquakes. For example, at least 597 earthquakes were recognized during a period of only six hours. At least two episodes of earthquakes constitute the Nazko swarm. In the first seismic phase from October 9 to November 1, 2007, a total of 153 earthquakes took place. During the second seismic phase between September 25, 2007 and June 12, 2008, 4,428 earthquakes occurred. These two seismic episodes were cross-correlated by scientists to understand changes in the development of the earthquake swarm. Correlation coefficients were around 1.0 for the beginnings of the periods of activity, indicating almost identical situations, and then decayed to around 0.5, indicating a decrease in similarity between the later stages of the two events. Scientific response The earthquake swarm was noted on October 12, 2007 in the Prince George Citizen by citizen staff, three days after the earthquakes began. Scientists mentioned in the report were seismologist John Cassidy of Natural Resources Canada and volcanologist Catherine Hickson, who was part of the Geological Survey of Canada at the time. At the time of the report, scientists did not know the origin of the swarm. Seismologist John Cassidy stated, \\"the depth is enough to rule out hydrothermal but it's up in the air as to whether the cause is tectonic shifts or volcanic activity. If it is volcanic there are certain characteristics that we would expect, there's a tremor-like character to it. And so we'll be looking for the types of events that we see beneath volcanoes and we'll be looking to see if they're getting closer to the surface or if they're migrating at all.\\" Even if the Nazko swarm were a warning of a volcanic eruption, Hickson doubted it would turn out to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes. \\"We're not talking about an injection of tonnes of ash many kilometers into the air like the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption or the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. We're talking about something very small, relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact... but it'll be extremely exciting\\", Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested that it would be characterized by a lava fountain that sends globs of lava into the air. This is similar to those that occur in Hawaii. Hickson said that a Nazko eruption could be a tourist attraction, but warned that noxious gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide would be released during the event. Preparedness and hazards Because no seismographs were close enough to the Nazko swarm zone before the earthquakes began, employees of Natural Resources Canada placed seismographs in the area to monitor future earthquakes in the area more clearly. An infrasound station is also being established, which is able to measure sound waves that would normally go unnoticed by human hearing. These stations can detect volcanic eruptions and the release of gas at volcanic vents, and can be used in combination with other geophysical data to monitor fluid flow within volcanoes. Employees of Natural Resources Canada have also visited two communities that were adjacent to the 2007–2008 earthquake swarm to renew information about the Nazko swarm, collect samples, and examine some of the more poorly studied volcanic deposits in the Nazko region. The Natural Resources Canada employees also measured carbon dioxide levels during the earthquake swarm. Carbon dioxide is usually discharged at faults in volcanically active areas and can collect in soil and under snow. Because of this, carbon dioxide concentrations can provide information on volcanic activity in the subsurface. The Nazko swarm did not cause any discernible discharge of carbon dioxide, which is normal for non-eruptive events. Nazko Cone, the volcano that was adjacent to the 2007–2008 Nazko earthquakes. The 2007–2008 Nazko earthquake swarm is one of numerous seismic events that have occurred near volcanoes in British Columbia. Volcanoes that have experienced volcanic earthquakes include the Mount Meager massif (seventeen events), Mount Cayley (four events), Mount Garibaldi (three events), Silverthrone Caldera (two events), Castle Rock (two events), Hoodoo Mountain (eight events), Crow Lagoon (four events), The Volcano (five events), and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex (eight events). Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain active magma chambers, indicating possible future eruptive activity. Although the available data do not allow a clear conclusion, these observations are indications that some of Canada's volcanoes may be active, with significant potential dangers. This seismic activity correlates both with some of Canada's most youthful volcanoes and with long-lived volcanoes with a history of significant explosive activity, such as Hoodoo Mountain and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. If magma were to rise towards the surface of Nazko, new earthquake swarms would occur, with a significant increase in the size and number of earthquakes. An eruption in the Nazko area would probably create a small cinder cone, similar to what formed Nazko Cone 7,200 years ago. Immediate hazards related to cinder cone eruptions in the Nazko area would probably be forest fires and, if an eruption column were produced, redirection of nearby air traffic.

They were the first two people to take the reptilian DNA, and make shape-shifting human beings that go between the fourth-dimensional, the Anunnaki, and human beings. Eventually, from ancient Mesopotamia, this spawned a thing called the Illuminati - the enlightened ones - coming up through the centuries, and choosing the kings, controlling your media, controlling your banking, blah blah blah. It's just theory at most points. I thought it'd make a great metal song, so I just went ahead and started writing about that. That's how the record came about, as far as the theme..\\" Reception Exclaim! named \\"Snakes for the Divine\\" as the No. 9 Metal Album of 2010.

In general this problem is extremely hard, and to tackle it with computer algorithms, certain assumptions are made about admissible placements and about operations allowed in placement modifications. Constraint graphs capture the restrictions of relative movements of the objects placed in the plane. These graphs, while sharing common idea, have different definition, depending on a particular design task or its model. Floorplanning In floorplanning, the model of a floorplan of an integrated circuit is a set of isothetic rectangles called \\"blocks\\" within a larger rectangle called \\"boundary\\" (e.g., \\"chip boundary\\", \\"cell boundary\\"). A possible definition of constraint graphs is as follows. The constraint graph for a given floorplan is a directed graph with vertex set being the set of floorplan blocks and there is an edge from block b1 to b2 (called horizontal constraint), if b1 is completely to the left of b2 and there is an edge from block b1 to b2 (called vertical constraint), if b1 is completely below b2. If only horizontal constraints are considered, one obtains the horizontal constraint graph. If only vertical constraints are considered, one obtains the vertical constraint graph. Under this definition, the constraint graph can have as many as O(n^2) edges, where n is the number of blocks. Therefore other, less dense constraint graphs are considered. The horizontal visibility graph is a horizontal constraint graph in which the horizontal constraint between two blocks exists only if there is a horizontal line segment which connects the two blocks and does not intersect any other blocks. In other words, one block is a potential \\"immediate obstacle\\" for moving another one horizontally. The vertical visibility graph is defined in a similar way. Channel routing Channel routing example Channel routing is the problem of routing of a set of nets N which have fixed terminals on two opposite sides of a rectangle (\\"channel\\"). In this context, the horizontal constraint graph is the undirected graph with vertex set N and two nets are connected by an edge if and only if horizontal segments of the routing must overlap. In the given example, only nets 5 and 6 do not have a horizontal constraint between them. The vertical constraint graph is the directed graph with vertex set N and two nets are connected by an edge if and only if there are two pins from different nets on the same vertical line and the edge is directed from the net with pin on the upper edge of the channel. This direction means that this net must be routed on a horizontal track above the horizontal tracks of the second net. In the given example, only nets 1 and 3 have a vertical constraint.

Plot  Grace Herbert (Kay Francis) is a 30-something woman who has made her living from seducing wealthy men and suing them for breach of promise. At the end of her finances, she and her maid, Josie (Margaret Hamilton) head to Miami where Grace hopes to find another rich man. When that plan falls through, she stumbles upon Ellen Daley (Mildred Coles), a young lady who is looking for a job as a secretary. Instead, Grace decide to make the girl her protege and teach her how to make money leading older wealthier men on for money. They leave for Chicago, and on the way meet Tom Dice (James Ellison) when he fixes their flat tire. All they know is that he's a cowboy, and while Ellen is attracted to him, Grace dismisses him. Grace introduces Ellen to Bill Vincent (Nigel Bruce), a vain man who likes young women, and who coaches Ellen on exactly how to lead a man on enough to get expensive presents from him, including a fat settlement to avoid a lawsuit. Despite some initial misgivings, Ellen begins to enjoy her role. After they are finished with Vincent in Chicago, the ladies move on to New York City and Van Payson (G.P. Huntley), another older wealthy man who is happy to squire a much younger woman. While out on a date, Ellen runs into Tom and the two of them end up sharing a cab when she gets separated. He makes arrangements to call on her, but Grace, who still thinks that Tom is \\"just a cowboy\\" criticizes Ellen for wanting to see him. After doing some research however, Grace finds out that Tom is a multi-millionaire and changes her mind. She encourages Ellen to marry him because he is so wealthy. While Ellen is very much in love with Tom, she refuses to consider marrying him because of how she has been earning her gifts. When Tom proposes, she tells him that she needs to think about it for a day. That night she leaves a note for Grace and runs away. Grace decides that since Ellen is gone, she's going to try to run her old game on Tom. In a men's club steamroom, Van overhears Bill talking about his experience with Ellen and the two of them realize that they were dealing with the same woman. When the two of them show up at her hotel and accuse her or running a scam, she turns the tables on them accusing Bill and Van of defaming Ellen's character and finagles them into paying her outstanding bills and sends them on their way. As they leave they justify their behavior to each other reassuring themselves that they have not been taken for another ride. In the meantime, Grace resumes her seduction of Tom and manipulates him into proposing to her. The next morning, Tom's mother (Katharine Alexander) pays her a visit only instead of threatening to block the marriage, she just lets Grace know that she knows all about Grace's past, but will bless their marriage as long as she promises to always love and care from him. This moves something in Grace and when Tom comes to visit, she tells him that she knows he still loves Ellen and he should go to Miami and marry her. He rushes out to get on a plane to find her. Tom's mother tells Grace that Tom's uncle - who is also a wealthy cattleman - is in town alone, and tells her that he is a man who needs to settle down and marry a woman who can bring some femininity to his bachelor's life. When Tom's mother tells Grace that he's in the lobby of the building, Grace tells Josie her maid to have him sent up while she gets ready to meet him.

It is a standalone 4-dimensional space visualization application built on the programmable Partiview data visualization engine designed by Stuart Levy of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) as an adjunct of the NCSA's Virtual Director virtual choreography project. The Virtual Universe Atlas project was launched by the American Museum of Natural History's Hayden Planetarium with significant programming support from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as well as Stuart Levy. The database draws on the National Virtual Observatory. Along with Celestia and Orbiter, and unlike most other planetarium applications, Digital Universe shares the capacity to visualize space from points outside Earth. Building on work by Japan's RIKEN, its planet renderings and zoom visualizations can match or exceed Celestia and Orbiter. Unlike Celestia and Orbiter, highly accurate visualization from distances beyond the Milky Way galaxy is integral to the software and the datasets. This allows for unrivaled flexibility in plotting itineraries that reveal true distances and configurations of objects in the observable sky. It therefore improves understanding of the surroundings of the solar system in terms of observer-neutral celestial coordinate systems—systems that are neither geocentric nor heliocentric—such as the galactic coordinate system and supergalactic coordinate system. The Digital Universe Atlas has spun off a commercial-grade planetarium platform from SCISS called Uniview that was featured in the White House star party on October 7, 2009. The Atlas database and Partiview interface is compatible with professional planetarium software such as Evans & Sutherland's Digistar and Sky-Skan's DigitalSky 2.

Location Camp Alger was about miles from Dunn Loring, a station on a branch of the Southern Railway, as above stated, and 7 miles from Washington, D.C., and about 5 miles distant from Fort Myer. The surface of this tract is rolling, partly wooded, with cultivated clearings and with good drainage. The soil is of clay and sand and nearly impervious to water. Immediately after the selection of this camp preparations were made for the reception of troops by the erection of storehouses at Dunn Loring, where the Southern Railway put in extra sidings to accommodate the increased traffic. Second Army Corps The Second Army Corps was constituted May 7, and May 16 Maj. Gen. William M. Graham, was assigned to the command, and the troops which were to compose the corps were ordered to this camp. General Graham arrived May 19 and assumed command, which he exercised during the existence of the camp. This corps was composed wholly of volunteers. The troops commenced arriving the 18th of May, and by the last of that month there were 18,309 officers and men in camp.

There were no adequate bathing facilities nearer than the Potomac River, which was 7 miles distant. The troops were encamped both in the open and wooded portions. Those in the latter did not seem to suffer on account of their position. The sinks were generally properly policed, of the regulation depth, and were very soon inclosed. The woods were quite badly polluted by the excreta of the men; but the commanding officer issued stringent sanitary regulations and used great efforts to see that they were obeyed. His efforts were fairly successful. The troops were well supplied with tentage. The camps of the different regiments were well policed, and the refuse properly disposed of by burning. The rations were abundant in quantity and good in quality. Field bakeries were established in the camp and at Dunn Loring on August 2, from which the corps was supplied with excellent bread. As heretofore stated, on 1 August it was decided to reduce the number of troops, one division being sent to Thoroughfare Gap, and about two weeks later it was decided to move the whole corps. Early in September that was accomplished. During the existence of this camp the weather was exceedingly hot and some portion of the time very rainy, both of which conditions, with myriads of flies which infested the camp, were the causes of much discomfort to the men.

After the death of the last one in 1831 without issue, the throne passed to Charles Albert, Prince of Carignano and next legitimate male heir. Marriage After the weddings of her older sisters to French Princes, was arranged the marriage between Maria Anna and her paternal uncle Prince Benedetto, Duke of Chablais, younger half- brother of Victor Amadeus III (as the son of Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia and his last wife, Elisabeth Therese of Lorraine). The wedding took place on 19 March 1775 at the Chapel of the Holy Shroud in Turin. They had no children but had a happy union: although they were close, Maria Anna always saw him as her uncle.The Edinburgh magazine, or Literary miscellany, p 25 Their official residence were the Palazzo Chiablese and the Ducal Castle of Agliè.

When in December 1798 the Republic of France invaded the Kingdom of Sardinia, the whole royal family went into exile. The Duke and Duchess of Chablais left Turin and moved to Sardinia, where they remained until the end of 1799. Then they left the island and settled in Rome at the Papal States. In 1805, they spent a few months in Florence as guests at King Louis I of Etruria, and his wife Queen Maria Luisa. In Italy, the Duke of Chablais was given control of the Army of Italy which contained French troops and intended on restoring the monarchy in France after the execution of Louis XVI in 1793.Louis XVI's sister Marie Clotilde of France was wife of Charles Emmanuel IV and queen consort since October 1796 He took part in the Battle of Loano. Benedetto, Duke of Chablais died on 4 January 1808 in Rome. In 1816 the now Dowager Duchess of Chablais received her younger brother Charles Felix their cousin Charles Albert. By that time, the states and properties of the House of Savoy where recovered; during Maria Anna's absence, the Palazzo Chiablese was used by Camillo Borghese, 6th Prince of Sulmona and his wife, the famous Pauline Bonaparte.Palazzo Chiablese in: piemonte.beniculturali.it [retrieved 2 June 2016]. However, Maria Anna didn't returned to her homeland immediately: in 1820 she acquired the Villa Rufinella in Frascati near Rome, having bought the property from Lucien Bonaparte. In 1822, despite protests from her brother and cousin, Maria Anna settled in Florence, despite the fact that the city actively participated in the period of unrest in the Kingdom of Sardinia the previous year. Death Only at the beginning of 1824 Maria Anna returned to Piedmont, where in the Castle of Moncalieri meet her brothers, the former King Victor Emmanuel I and the new monarch Charles Felix. In the summer of the same year, together with Charles Felix and his wife Maria Cristina she made a trip to Savoy, where they visited Hautecombe Abbey. Maria Anna died at the Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi in Turin in 1824 aged 66 and was buried at the Royal Basilica of Superga.

It is the 14th installment and 5th main installment of FromSoftware's Armored Core series. Armored Core V is a return to the more traditional style of gameplay found in the original series of games. It is an indirect sequel to Armored Core 4 and Armored Core: For Answer. Gameplay Whereas previous games in the series focused on quick- reflex combat, Armored Core V relies heavily on tactical gameplay. Similar to the first games in the series, Armored Core V requires players to use level geography to their advantage. New to the series is Ultimate Weapons, which deal enormous damage; however, these weapons need to be recharged between uses, limiting the player to only one use per mission or match. The online mode features five-on-five team-based battles, with each side battling over specific objectives across the map. One member of each team is designated as the Operator and must oversee the entire battle and issue orders to their team. On March 10, 2014, it was announced via the Armored Core Facebook page that the online servers for Armored Core V would be shut down 10 days later on March 20, 2014. Release The game was released in Japan on January 26, 2012 for both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game was released by Bandai Namco Entertainment on March 20, 2012 in North America, March 22, 2012 in Australia, and March 23, 2012 in Europe. FromSoftware has released a companion application for iOS and Android devices which provides access to a database of in-game parts and weapons to aid in mech customization. In Japan, those who pre-ordered Last Raven Portable received an art book and a download code for an exclusive variant of the Moonlight close-quarters weapon. In North America, two promotional download packages were offered to those who pre-ordered Armored Core V: Amazon offered the Recon Pack, while GameStop offered the Heavy Assault Pack. Both of these packs can now be purchased from the in-game store. Both content packs did not add anything new to the game, rather they enabled players to access parts far earlier than they would normally by playing through the campaign. Reception The game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one nine, two eights, and one nine for a total of 34 out of 40. The Daily Telegraph gave the Xbox 360 version four stars out of five and said it was \\"A brilliant game that is nonetheless difficult to recommend to everyone,\\" but that \\"those with an eye for detail and a fair amount of patience will be rewarded with a deep, engaging and entirely idiosyncratic experience. Just don't go in expecting your hand to be held at any point.\\" The Digital Fix gave the PlayStation 3 version seven out of ten and said it was \\"a very sterile and cold experience\\" without its multiplayer approach. Metro likewise gave it seven out of ten and said it was \\"still not the game that will make giant robot sims mainstream, but it does have some innovative ideas in terms of both combat and online play.\\" The Observer gave the game a mixed review and said that it \\"looks fantastic and is thoroughly entertaining, but its impenetrability may prove too much for all but the faithful.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Official website * Category:2012 video games Category:Armored Core Category:Video games about mecha Category:Bandai Namco games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Third-person shooters Category:Video game sequels Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Armored Core V"},{"id":"25786608","text":"Denmark is an unincorporated community in Curry County, Oregon, United States, between Bandon and Port Orford where U.S. Route 101 crosses Willow Creek.

He has been Bishop of Auckland, New Zealand, since 1994. Early life Dunn was born in London and is the eldest son of the late H. P. (\\"Pat\\") Dunn, a prominent Auckland obstetrician. Dunn was considerably influenced by his father and his mother, June Dunn, a former school teacher, in later deciding to become a priest and being appointed a bishop.\\"My Mentor: Patrick Dunn Bishop of Auckland\\", Herald on Sunday, 8 April 2007, p. 31. He was educated at St Michael's School, Remuera, Sacred Heart College, Auckland, from 1961 to 1967, and the University of Auckland in 1968. He studied for the Catholic priesthood under the Jesuits at Holy Name Seminary, Christchurch from 1969 to 1970, and under the Vincentians at Holy Cross College, Mosgiel from 1971 to 1976. Beginning in 1988 he studied for a master's degree in theology from the Melbourne College of Divinity, which resulted in the publication of his study: Priesthood: a re-examination of the Roman Catholic theology of the presbyterate.Alba House, New York, 1990 Ordinations Dunn was ordained a priest at St Michael's Church in Remuera on 24 April 1976. He then carried out pastoral work with Maori in Mangere East and lived at the Auckland Catholic marae Te Unga Waka Marae in Epsom. Later, he served in the Auckland suburbs of Takapuna, Pakuranga and Northcote.Donna Chisholm, \\"A bishop with a cause\\", Sunday Star Times, 16 April 2000, Section C, p. 2 In 1986 and 1987 he was Director of Vocations for the Diocese of Auckland. In 1992 he was appointed pastoral assistant to the Bishop of Auckland Denis Browne. Bishop On 24 July 1994, Dunn was ordained to the episcopate as an auxiliary bishop of Auckland. On 24 December 1994 he was appointed Bishop of Auckland to succeed Browne who had been named Bishop of Hamilton. Dunn was installed as Bishop of Auckland in St Patrick's Cathedral, Auckland, on 29 March 1995. In 2015, Dunn expressed dissatisfaction with the English version of the Mass in use since November 2011. Dunn had served as New Zealand's representative on the International Commission on English in the Liturgy (ICEL), which had produced a translation of the Roman Missal in 1998 after 17 years of effort. The Congregation for Divine Worship had rejected that translation, formed its own committee, and produced the translation now in use. Dunn wrote that it was \\"too often unclear and sometimes verging on the unintelligible\\", \\"an accurate English translation of the Latin, but not a clear and beautiful vernacular text\\". He proposed a new translation be undertaken and has suggested that all the English-speaking bishops' conferences agree to pursue this in concert. New Zealand's bishops first endorsed instead efforts to establish different guidelines for translation rather than a new translation, and in 2017 welcomed Pope Francis' establishment of a commission to review the standards followed in rejecting the 1998 translation. Dunn said the idea was to avoid rules that \\"impose Latin syntax on contemporary English\\". In September 2017, Dunn authored an essay in NZ Catholic on the relationship of the Church to LGBT Catholics. He said that communication comes before judgment and instruction: \\"For Jesus it was most often friendship first, and conversion second. We all listen most intently to those we love and those whose company we enjoy.\\" He recommended the work of Jesuit James Martin as a guide, advocating its inclusive language and sensitivity. He wrote that an attitude of respect requires the Church to call people by the terms they prefer rather than homosexual and called the Vatican's use of the phrase objectively disordered \\"needlessly cruel\\". In 2018, Dunn is the secretary of the New Zealand Catholic Bishops Conference and the episcopal deputy for Holy Cross Seminary and Good Shepherd College.

When the liquid settles, it balances out to the same level in all of the containers regardless of their shape and volume. If additional liquid is added to one vessel, a new equal level will be established in all the connected vessels. This process is part of Stevin's Law and occurs because gravity and pressure are constant in each vessel (hydrostatic pressure). Blaise Pascal, with Pascal's law, proved in the seventeenth century that the pressure exerted on a molecule of a liquid is transmitted in full and with the same intensity in all directions.  Applications  Since the days of ancient Rome, the concept of communicating vessels has been used for indoor plumbing, via aquifers and lead pipes. Water will reach the same level in all parts of the system, which acts as communicating vessels, regardless of what the lowest point is of the pipes - although in practical terms the lowest point of the system depends on the ability of the plumbing to withstand the pressure of the liquid. In cities, water towers are frequently used so that city plumbing will function as communicating vessels, distributing water to higher floors of buildings with sufficient pressure. Hydraulic presses, using systems of communicating vessels, are widely used in various applications of industrial processes.

It is a decision-making process that blends management needs and resource considerations with visitor needs and desires to determine the most effective way to communicate a message to a targeted audience.National Association for Interpretation Interpretation at informal learning institutions builds on Freeman Tilden’s principles of interpretation, focusing especially on relating content in a meaningful way to a visitor’s own experience, provoking emotion, thought or further inquiry into a subject. The communication goals of interpretation at mission-based institutions are based on achieving previously specified outcomes.Heritage Destination Consulting Most interpretive plans are based on a thematic approach to interpretation, and therefore, place emphasis on which themes are important to communicate to various audiences. Interpretive planning may also guide how audiences will react to and interact with a particular site or exhibit. Associates An interpretive plan establishes these specific goals for an institution’s market(s) and builds a structured vision of how to achieve them by communicating to an audience through appropriate and meaningful experiences. It combines developing, organizing and analyzing content into relevant and engaging messages, with creating exciting ways for visitors to experience this content.AldrichPears Associates An interpretive plan establishes the communication process, through which meanings and relationships of the cultural and natural world, past and present, are revealed to a visitor through experiences with objects, artifacts, landscapes, sites, exhibits and people. To effectively engage a visitor and achieve these objectives, as well as any other institutional objectives and requirements (financial, operational, environmental, etc.), an interpretive plan is built through addressing the following issues: # Why do you want to interpret something? # Who should be involved in the interpretive process? # What are you interpreting? # Who you are interpreting for? # What messages do you want to communicate? # What are your specific objectives? # What media will you use? # How will your interpretation be implemented? # How will it be evaluated? # How will it be maintained? The resulting product provides a vision for the future of interpretation, education, and visitor experience opportunities. It identifies and analyzes interpretation, education, and visitor experience goals and issues and recommends the most effective, efficient, and practical ways to address those goals and issues.National Park Service The plan guides the further design and development of the project, becoming a resource for architecture, exhibit development and fundraising.

Rendered in English the song became a hit single for Kiki Dee and - as \\"Emotion\\" - for Helen Reddy. Background and first recordings The original song title \\"Amoureuse\\" - which does not feature in its lyrics - is the French equivalent of the English adjective amorous and is also a feminine noun meaning lover. Sanson's lyric describes the contradictory feelings of passion and fear of a woman involved in a new love affair. Sanson was inspired to write the song while driving \\"up the Champs-Elysées in my little Autobianchi A112\\" at six AM: \\"It was a feeling of freedom... I was constantly monitored... and I wrote this song because I knew I was going to get yelled at by my parents [upon arriving home].\\" \\"Amoureuse\\" had its first major impact out of France via a cover version for the Quebec market by France Castel (fr) which reached #1 on the French-language chart for Canada in December 1972: the track was featured on Castel's 1973 album release Je le vois dans ma soupe. The earliest English rendering of the song was by lyricist Gary Osborne, who from the age of 15 had written English lyrics for a number of French-language songs beginning with \\"Adiós Amor\\" in 1967. While faithfully rendering Sanson's lyrics in the chorus, Osborne in the verses introduced the concept of an initial sexual encounter into the song. The first evident recording of this version was by Sanson herself with UK and US single releases in respectively September 1972 and November 1972. The Sanson/Osborne version of \\"Amoureuse\\" was then recorded in April 1973 by Kiki Dee who credits Tony King, vice president of Rocket Records, with suggesting that she record \\"Amoureuse\\" for her album Loving and Free produced by Elton John: issued as a single August 31, 1973, Dee's \\"Amoureuse\\" made a belated chart entry in November 1973 to rise to a UK chart peak of #13 that December, besting an attempted cover version by Polly Brown issued September 21, 1973. Almost a year after her UK success with \\"Amoureuse\\", the track would afford Dee a chart hit in Australia with a #12 peak in the autumn of 1974. In the US, \\"Amoureuse\\" served as the B-side for the February 1975 Kiki Dee Band release \\"Step by Step\\", the non-charting follow-up single to \\"I've Got the Music in Me\\". \\"Amoureuse\\" was re-issued in the UK as the B-side of the 1976 Kiki Dee single \\"Loving & Free\\": the single became a double-sided hit reaching #13 on the UK chart and #4 in Ireland. A 1984 reissue of Dee's \\"Amoureuse\\" reached #77 on the UK chart. \\"Emotion\\" - Patti Dahlstrom version also recorded by Helen Reddy Artie Wayne, an exec with the Warner Music Group whose Elektra label handled Sanson's U.S. releases, sent a copy of Sanson's Amoureuse album to his friend Texas singer/songwriter Patti Dahlstrom suggesting Dahlstrom put English lyrics to the title cut. Dahlstrom would recall: \\"I was mesmerised by the music to 'Amoureuse', but I don’t speak French and had no idea what the lyrics meant. I carried the melody in my head for weeks and then one day the first line – 'Lonely women are the desperate kind' – just fell out as my key turned in the lock, and the lyric to 'Emotion' wrote itself very quickly.\\" Dahlstrom's English rendering of \\"Amoureuse\\" was introduced on the singer's own album The Way I Am which was recorded in August 1973: the track re- entitled Sanson's composition as \\"Emotion\\", that word being prominently featured in Dahlstrom's lyrics which expressed the viewpoint of a woman whose relationship with an inconsiderate lover is redeemed by the passion of their periodic trysts. \\"Emotion\\" was issued as a single off The Way I Am in October 1973 but did not chart. Patti Dahlstrom was also a friend of Paul Williams whose own compositions were regularly recorded by Helen Reddy, and Reddy recorded \\"Emotion\\" for inclusion on her 1974 Free and Easy album from which an abridged edit was issued as a single in January 1975 to peak at #22, Reddy's first Top Twenty shortfall since before \\"I Am Woman\\" in 1972. \\"Emotion\\" did reach #1 on the Easy Listening chart, the sixth of Reddy's eight Easy Listening #1's and her last consecutive. In 2009, Véronique Sanson stated in an interview to the French magazine Platine that Dahlstrom's version remains her favorite version of \\"Amoureuse\\"VSPlatine5.jpg (image) although Sanson has evidently forgotten that Dahlstrom's \\"Emotion\\" is lyrically distinct from the Osborne translation.Asked \\"Y a-t-il eu deux textes anglais?\\" Sanson responds: \\"Non, c'est juste qu'Helen Reddy a préféré prendre en titre un mot anglais du texte que garder 'Amoureuse' qui n'était pas un mot anglais. Cependant, je suis certaine que le texte était le même.\\" Other versions With its original French lyrics \\"Amoureuse\\" has also been recorded by many singers in France and Québec, including Hart-Rouge (album La fabrique / 1994), Lucid Beausonge (fr) (album Ils chantent Véronique Sanson / 1996), Réjane Perry (fr) (album Atlas, Les plus belles chansons françaises, 1972 / 1996), Les Enfoirés (Jean-Louis Aubert, Hélène Ségara, Natasha St-Pier, Christophe Willem) (album Les Enfoirés font leur cinéma / 2009), Lara Fabian (album Toutes les femmes en moi / 2009), and Caroline Néron (album Le destin /2010). Olivia Newton-John recorded \\"Amoureuse\\" with the Gary Osborne-penned lyrics for her 1973 album Music Makes My Day and would remake the song as a duet with Elaine Paige for Paige's 2010 duets album Elaine Page & Friends. In 1998 Barbara Dex reached #10 on the Ultratip chart with her version of Amoureuse with Osborne's lyrics: the track was also included on Dex's album Strong. \\"Amoureuse\\" with Osborne's lyrics has also been recorded by Linda Martin (album You Needed Me/ 1998), Deborah Sasson (de) (album Romance/ 1984), and Pete Townshend (bootleg recording The Roundhouse, London, April 14, 1974), among others. Shirley Bassey recorded \\"Emotion\\" for her 1975 album Good, Bad but Beautiful Véronique Sanson recorded \\"Amoureuse\\" with German lyrics by Michael Kunze (released b/w \\"Regen am Morgen (Besoin de Personne)\\"), and also recorded a Spanish version entitled \\"Enamorada\\". The German-language rendering of \\"Amoureuse\\" with lyrics by Michael Kunze was also recorded by Katja Ebstein, appearing on her 1977 album Liebe under the title \\"Für einen Tag mit dir\\". Alternate German-language renderings have been recorded by Gitte - \\"Was wär ich ohne dich\\" on her 1976 album Was wär ich ohne dich - and by Barbara Stromberger (de) - \\"Mehr als Erinnerung\\" on her 1975 album Die zweite Zeit beginnt. A Dutch rendering which retains the \\"Amoureuse\\" title was recorded by Barbara Nielsen - who wrote the lyrics - in 1975. An alternative Dutch rendering entitled \\"Dit vergeet ik niet\\" was a 1996 single for Tamara Tol (nl). Also in 1996 a Flemish rendering entitled \\"Open Einde\\" was recorded by Splinter a duo comprising Guido Sergooris formerly of Toast (nl) and Hedwig Demesmaeker for their album Arabesk. Daniela Davoli had a 1978 single release of an Italian rendering of \\"Amoureuse\\" entitled \\"Diverso amore mio\\" (\\"Other than my love\\"), written by lyricist Cristiano Magioglio, which was that same year recorded by Véronique Sanson (single \\"Povero maledetto\\" (Le maudit) / \\"Diverso amore mio\\" (Amoureuse)).

It aired on January 25, 2010 in the US (January 24 in Canada). While Chuck embarks on his first solo mission, Morgan faces a continued revolt of his co- workers masterminded by Lester. Plot summary=Main plot As the episode begins, Chuck is alarmed by the presence of Shaw, having been appointed by Beckman to lead the team, particularly after learning from Casey that Chuck's performance is the subject of interviews the agent is holding with Sarah. Shaw summons Chuck to Castle, where he tells Chuck that it is not his own approach to spy work that holds him back, but rather Casey and Sarah. Shaw assigns Chuck his first solo mission in Paris, which Chuck enthusiastically accepts over the misgivings of Sarah and Casey. After being briefed and equipped by Shaw, Chuck boards the flight, where he introduces himself to a fellow passenger, Hannah (Kristin Kreuk), with whom he begins to connect over drinks. When she points out a particularly massive man, Chuck flashes and identifies him as Ring close-combat expert Hugo Panzer. After he checks in with Shaw and Sarah, Shaw reveals he knew Panzer would be on the flight all along and orders him to recover a code key being escorted to France by Panzer. Chuck manages to drug Panzer and takes his baggage claim ticket. Chuck sneaks into the cargo hold and recovers the key, but is confronted again by Panzer, who has recovered. Chuck finds a fencing saber in the baggage, flashes, and uses it to subdue him before rejoining Hannah on the passenger deck. As he shares another drink with Hannah, he realizes he never ordered one, and that he has been poisoned. He glances across the aisle, and Panzer, who has escaped, raises a glass to him. Chuck is captured by a second Ring operative masquerading as a flight attendant (Josie Davis) while reporting in. She forces him back to the cargo deck where she and Panzer demand he return the key. He manages to escape when Sarah and Shaw take control of the aircraft remotely and the two enemy agents are knocked unconscious. Chuck plans to spend a few days in Paris, but instead is ordered back to Burbank immediately with the key. He says goodbye to Hannah, and suggests she look him up for a job at the Buy More, as she recently lost hers. Back at Castle, Shaw uses the key to unlock a data cache previously recovered by the team and Carina. He reveals the safe contained vital intelligence on the Ring which may be their best chance of destroying them. Up at the Buy More, Chuck is lamenting his aborted visit to Paris when Hannah walks in. Sarah and Shaw Shaw grills Sarah over Chuck's qualifications as a spy. Sarah defends him, but also objects when Shaw orders Chuck onto his first solo mission. Shaw not fully briefing Chuck on Panzer's presence on the flight puts them both at odds with each other, and Shaw confronts her about the truth of her feelings for Chuck. He reveals he knew she went \\"off grid\\" in Lisbon, which Sarah explains away as taking time to bury Bryce's ashes, as it was where their first mission occurred. Shaw notes that Sarah protects Chuck rather than pushing him to be the best spy he can be and he speculates aloud whether she's actually part of the Ring. Later, Shaw directs Sarah to take control of Chuck's flight to help him escape Panzer and his accomplice. After Chuck returns, Shaw takes a small envelope from the data cache after debriefing the team on the Ring data. When Sarah confronts him, he shows that it contained a diamond engagement ring - the agent who obtained the data on the Ring was his wife, Evelyn, who was killed in the process. Buy More Now that Morgan has been promoted to assistant manager, a small rebellion forms led by Lester. Initially their pranks fail because Morgan was already well-versed in their tactics, but eventually Lester begins to gain the upper hand. Morgan turns to Casey for help regaining control, and names him his \\"Lieutenant Assistant Manager\\", due to his coworkers' fear of him. Casey's presence alone causes most of Lester's support to give up, and active intimidation (extinguishing a cigar in his own palm) causes all but Jeff and Lester to desert. Later, Casey abducts Lester and brainwashes him into supporting Morgan as assistant manager. When Jeff triggers Lester's hypnotism by using Morgan's name, Lester goes into a trance- like state and says, \\"Morgan Grimes is the kindest, warmest, most understanding human being I've ever known in my life.\\" When Morgan asks Casey how he managed to turn Lester, Casey advises he maintain plausible deniability. Production Actress Kristin Kreuk was cast in the role of Hannah on September 2, 2009. This was followed by the announcement that \\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin was cast in the role of Hugo Panzer on October 7, 2009.

The VF can be realized as a traditional software firewall on a guest virtual machine already running, a purpose-built virtual security appliance designed with virtual network security in mind, a virtual switch with additional security capabilities, or a managed kernel process running within the host hypervisor.  Background  So long as a computer network runs entirely over physical hardware and cabling, it is a physical network. As such it can be protected by physical firewalls and fire walls alike; the first and most important protection for a physical computer network always was and remains a physical, locked, flame-resistant door.\\"Physical network security key to fighting low- tech threats\\" Morisey, Michael. SearchNetworking.com, Feb 2009.\\"Physical Network Security\\" Rodriguez, Erik. Skullbox.com May 2005. Since the inception of the Internet this was the case, and structural fire walls and network firewalls were for a long time both necessary and sufficient. Since about 1998 there has been an explosive increase in the use of virtual machines (VM) in addition to — sometimes instead of — physical machines to offer many kinds of computer and communications services on local area networks and over the broader Internet. The advantages of virtual machines are well explored elsewhere.\\"The Pros and Cons of Virtual Machines in the Datacenter\\" Chao, Wellie, DevX.com Jan 2006\\"Transform your Business with Virtualization\\", Vmware Virtualization Basics Virtual machines can operate in isolation (for example as a guest operating system on a personal computer) or under a unified virtualized environment overseen by a supervisory virtual machine monitor or \\"hypervisor\\" process. In the case where many virtual machines operate under the same virtualized environment they might be connected together via a virtual network consisting of virtualized network switches between machines and virtualized network interfaces within machines. The resulting virtual network could then implement traditional network protocols (for example TCP) or virtual network provisioning such as VLAN or VPN, though the latter while useful for their own reasons are in no way required. There is a continued perception that virtual machines are inherently secure because they are seen as \\"sandboxed\\" within the host operating system.\\"Does a sandbox or virtual machine help protect your privacy?\\" Notenboom, Leo.

SearchEnterpriseLinux.com Apr 2006 It is often believed that the host, in like manner, is secured against exploitation from the virtual machine itself\\"Core Security Technologies Discovers Critical Vulnerability In Vmware's Desktop Virtualization Software\\" Core Security Technologies, Feb 2008 and that the host is no threat to the virtual machine because it is a physical asset protected by traditional physical and network security. Even when this is not explicitly assumed, early testing of virtual infrastructures often proceeds in isolated lab environments where security is not as a rule an immediate concern, or security may only come to the fore when the same solution is moving into production or onto a computer cloud, where suddenly virtual machines of different trust levels may wind up on the same virtual network running across any number of physical hosts. Because they are true networks, virtual networks may end up suffering the same kinds of vulnerabilities long associated with a physical network, some of which being: * Users on machines within the virtual network have access to all other machines on the same virtual network. * Compromising or misappropriating one virtual machine on a virtual network is sufficient to provide a platform for additional attacks against other machines on the same network segment. * If a virtual network is internetworked to the physical network or broader Internet then machines on the virtual network might have access to external resources (and external exploits) that could leave them open to exploitation. * Network traffic that passes directly between machines without passing through security devices is unmonitored. The problems created by the near invisibility of between-virtual machine (VM-to-VM) traffic on a virtual network are exactly like those found in physical networks, complicated by the fact that the packets may be moving entirely inside the hardware of a single physical host: * Because the virtual network traffic may never leave the physical host hardware, security administrators cannot observe VM-to-VM traffic, cannot intercept it, and so cannot know what that traffic is for. * Logging of VM-to-VM network activity within a single host and verification of virtual machine access for regulatory compliance purposes becomes difficult. * Inappropriate uses of virtual network resources and bandwidth consumption VM-to-VM are difficult to discover or rectify. * Unusual or inappropriate services running on or within the virtual network could go undetected. There are security issues known only in virtualized environments that wreak havoc with physical security measures and practices, and some of these are touted as actual advantages of virtual machine technology over physical machines:\\"A Survey on Virtual Machine Security\\" Reuben, JS. Helsinki University of Technology, undated * VMs can be deliberately (or unexpectedly) migrated between trusted and untrusted virtualized environments where migration is enabled. * VMs and/or virtual storage volumes can be easily cloned and the clone made to run on any part of the virtualized environment, including a DMZ. * Many companies use their purchasing or IT departments as the IT security lead agency, applying security measures at the time a physical machine is taken from the box and initialized. Since virtual machines can be created in a few minutes by any authorized user and set running without a paper trail, they can in these cases bypass established \\"first boot\\" IT security practices. * VMs have no physical reality leaving not a trace of their creation nor (in larger virtualized installations) of their continued existence. They can be as easily destroyed as well, leaving nearly no digital signature and absolutely no physical evidence whatsoever. In addition to the network traffic visibility issues and uncoordinated VM sprawl, a rogue VM using just the virtual network, switches and interfaces (all of which run in a process on the host physical hardware) can potentially break the network as could any physical machine on a physical network — and in the usual ways — though now by consuming host CPU cycles it can additionally bring down the entire virtualized environment and all the other VMs with it simply by overpowering the host physical resources the rest of the virtualized environment depend upon. This was likely to become a problem, but it was perceived within the industry as a well understood problem and one potentially open to traditional measures and responses.\\"IT Audit for the Virtual Environment\\" SANS.org, Dec 2009\\"POWER5 Virtualization: How to work with VLANs using the IBM Virtual I/O Server\\" IBM Inc.

TechTarget SearchNetworking, Oct 2009  Virtual firewalls  One method to secure, log and monitor VM-to-VM traffic involved routing the virtualized network traffic out of the virtual network and onto the physical network via VLANs, and hence into a physical firewall already present to provide security and compliance services for the physical network. The VLAN traffic could be monitored and filtered by the physical firewall and then passed back into the virtual network (if deemed legitimate for that purpose) and on to the target virtual machine. Not surprisingly, LAN managers, security experts and network security vendors began to wonder if it might be more efficient to keep the traffic entirely within the virtualized environment and secure it from there.\\"Security considerations for virtual environments\\" Rosenberg, David.

March 2008 vmblog.com A virtual firewall then is a firewall service or appliance running entirely within a virtualised environment — even as another virtual machine, but just as readily within the hypervisor itself — providing the usual packet filtering and monitoring that a physical firewall provides. The VF can be installed as a traditional software firewall on a guest VM already running within the virtualized environment; or it can be a purpose-built virtual security appliance designed with virtual network security in mind; or it can be a virtual switch with additional security capabilities; or it can be a managed kernel process running within the host hypervisor that sits atop all VM activity. The current direction in virtual firewall technology is a combination of security-capable virtual switches,Introduction to the Nexus 1000V. Cisco Inc. and virtual security appliances. Some virtual firewalls integrate additional networking functions such as site-to-site and remote access VPN, QoS, URL filtering and more.\\"VMsafe APIs reassure wary IT security professionals\\" Lukkad, VJ. Identity and Access Management Blog. Aug 2009\\"Should I have a Firewall for my Virtual World?\\" VMInformer.Case Study: Winsert Inc.  Operation  Virtual firewalls can operate in different modes to provide security services, depending on the point of deployment. Typically these are either bridge-mode or hypervisor-mode (hypervisor-based, hypervisor- resident). Both may come shrink wrapped as a virtual security appliance and may install a virtual machine for management purposes. A virtual firewall operating in bridge-mode acts like its physical-world firewall analog; it sits in a strategic part of the network infrastructure — usually at an inter- network virtual switch or bridge — and intercepts network traffic destined for other network segments and needing to travel over the bridge. By examining the source origin, the destination, the type of packet it is and even the payload the VF can decide if the packet is to be allowed passage, dropped, rejected, or forwarded or mirrored to some other device. Initial entrants into the virtual firewall field were largely bridge-mode, and many offers retain this feature. By contrast, a virtual firewall operating in hypervisor-mode is not actually part of the virtual network at all, and as such has no physical-world device analog. A hypervisor-mode virtual firewall resides in the virtual machine monitor or hypervisor where it is well positioned to capture VM activity including packet injections. The entire monitored VM and all its virtual hardware, software, services, memory and storage can be examined, as can changes in these . Further, since a hypervisor-based virtual firewall is not part of the network proper and is not a virtual machine its functionality cannot be monitored in turn or altered by users and software limited to running under a VM or having access only to the virtualized network. Bridge- mode virtual firewalls can be installed just as any other virtual machine in the virtualized infrastructure. Since it is then a virtual machine itself, the relationship of the VF to all the other VM may become complicated over time due to VMs disappearing and appearing in random ways, migrating between different physical hosts, or other uncoordinated changes allowed by the virtualized infrastructure. Hypervisor-mode virtual firewalls require a modification to the physical host hypervisor kernel in order to install process hooks or modules allowing the virtual firewall system access to VM information and direct access to the virtual network switches and virtualized network interfaces moving packet traffic between VMs or between VMs and the network gateway. The hypervisor-resident virtual firewall can use the same hooks to then perform all the customary firewall functions like packet inspection, dropping, and forwarding but without actually touching the virtual network at any point. Hypervisor-mode virtual firewalls can be very much faster than the same technology running in bridge-mode because they are not doing packet inspection in a virtual machine, but rather from within the kernel at native hardware speeds.

With the introduction of Islam in 1985 by Ahmadi Muslims, there are approximately 50 Muslims in the country, of which all are members of the Ahmadiyya movement. Due to the country's small population, this represents 0.5% of Tuvalu. The Tuvalu Mosque, in Funafuti, the capital of Tuvalu, is the only mosque in the country. History Islam was first introduced to the island nation by a British Ahmadi Muslim of Pakistani descent, Iftikhar A. Ayaz, who works as the British consular representative to Tuvalu Islands. In 1985, he came to Tuvalu, and in out of office hours, he endeavoured to introduce the Islamic faith to the local population. With several converts to the faith, Ayaz requested the headquarters of the Community in London to send a missionary to the Islands. As a result, Hafiz Jibrail, a Ghanaian missionary, who was already based in the South Pacific at the time, arrived in 1989, approximately four years after the introduction of Islam to the nation. However, in 1991 Hafiz Jibrail had to be transferred to the Kiribati Islands and thus was replaced by Abdul Ghaffar, another Ghanaian missionary to the Community. Nonetheless, having served the Islands for roughly 5 years, he returned to serve his home country, Ghana. After a lag of several years, during which the islands had no missionary, Abdul Hakeem Boateng, another Ghanaian missionary arrived in 2003, who served there until 2009. Since 2009, Muhammad Idris, an Indonesian missionary to the Ahmadiyya Community, is now the current and first non-Ghanaian missionary to Tuvalu. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community translated the Quran into the Tuvaluan language in 1990. The Tuvalu mosque, first constructed in 1991, is the only mosque in the Islands.

The 47th Virginia was formed in June 1861, with men recruited in Caroline, Middlesex, Essex, and Stafford counties. One company, Company H, was recruited in Maryland and known as Zarvona's Zouaves. The unit served under the command of Generals Pettigrew, Field, Heth, H.H. Walker, and Barton. It fought with the Army of Northern Virginia from Seven Pines to Cold Harbor, then was active in the trenches of Petersburg and around Appomattox. This regiment totalled 444 effectives in April, 1862, and sustained 34 casualties of the 156 engaged at Frayser's Farm. It reported 29 casualties at Second Manassas, 45 at Fredericksburg, and 45 at Chancellorsville. Twenty-three percent of the 209 in action at Gettysburg were disabled. During February 1865, the 47th and 55th Regiments were consolidated, but only 2 sergeants of the 47th surrendered on April 9. The field officers were Colonels George W. Richardson and Robert M.

This list of birds of North Dakota includes species documented in the U.S. state of North Dakota. The list is derived from Checklist of North Dakota Birds produced in April 2016 by the North Dakota Game and Fish Department (NDGFD). The basic NDGFD list contains 375 confirmed and extant species, two extinct species, and 20 species classed as hypothetical (see below). Seventeen additional species have been added from eBird records and three more from the North Dakota Bird Records Committee (NDBRC) review list which are not found in the other sources. As of July 2020, the combined lists contained 415 species. Of them, 162 and a subspecies are on the review list (see below). The NDGFD list considers 44 species to be accidental, and eight species have been introduced to North America. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them.

It fought mostly with the Army of Northern Virginia. The 49th Virginia completed its organization in July 1861. Its members were from the counties of Prince William, Warren, Fauquier, Rappahannock, Amherst, and Shenandoah. Three companies fought at First Manassas and these companies formed the nucleus of the regiment. It was assigned to General Featherston's, Early's, W.Smith's, Pegram's, and J.A. Walker's Brigade, Army of Northern Virginia. The unit participated in many battles from Williamsburg to Cold Harbor, was active in Early's Shenandoah Valley operations, and took part in the final campaign at Appomattox. It reported 40 casualties at First Manassas and in April, 1862, contained 539 effectives. The regiment lost fifty-three percent of the 424 at Seven Pines, had 2 killed and 36 wounded during the Seven Days' Battles, and suffered 5 killed and 73 wounded in the Maryland Campaign.

The regiment participated in the Battle of Carnifex Ferry on 10 September 1861; afterwards one of the cavalry companies was disabled and the other two transferred to the 8th Regiment Virginia Cavalry. The unit was reorganized in May 1862, with nine companies. It moved to Tennessee and in February 1862, was captured at Fort Donelson. After being exchanged, it was assigned to the Department of Western Virginia and fought in Gen. Wm. W. Loring's Kanawha Valley Campaign of 1862 and participated in the capture of Charleston, Virginia (now, West Virginia) on 13 September 1862. Later the 50th served in J.M. Jones', G.C. Wharton's, and Augustus Forsberg's Brigade, Army of Northern Virginia. It participated in numerous conflicts from Chancellorsville to Cold Harbor, moved with Jubal Early to the Shenandoah Valley, and fought its last battle at Waynesboro. The regiment reported 10 killed and 40 wounded at Fort Donelson, and there were 8 killed and 110 wounded at Chancellorsville. More than forty percent of the 240 engaged at Gettysburg were disabled, and it sustained heavy casualties in the fight at The Wilderness. During April 1865, it disbanded.

The software is complementary with existing antivirus software. In January 2011 Immunet was acquired by Sourcefire. The application is free-of-charge, although a commercial version is available. It claims to be lightweight and provides always up-to-date protection against the threats. Virus signature files are stored in the cloud, not on individual computers, so signature downloads are not required. Once a virus is detected and blocked for one user, all other Immunet users receive the same protection almost instantly. The software is noted for its ability to allow individual users to easily author their own signatures.  Products  Immunet was previously provided by Sourcefire in two editions, Free (for personal use), and Plus (for commercial use). As of June 10, 2014, the commercial version was discontinued, though Cisco (having acquired SourceFire) continued to support the free version. At version 3.0 , Immunet Free offers protection based upon the virus definitions in the cloud, and an option to include the ClamAV off- line virus definitions for use when not connected to the Internet. Immunet advises that the free version be used alongside another antivirus program, and supports several particular such programs in the sense that they co-install properly and work in tandem during normal operations without any obvious interference or resource drag. This is a significant difference between Immunet and other contemporary antivirus products.  Effectiveness  While independent testing has been performed, PCMag, in 2010, rated the product to be fair in its effectiveness. Immunet's virus definitions are stored on servers available over the Internet, requiring less memory and system resource than antivirus programs that reside on the user's computer. Cloud protection has been known to give better protection and detection, on the other hand, offline protection is not particularly good. Overall, the effectiveness of the Free product is average; the company recommends that users employ the Free product as an additional protection, rather than using it alone. In Windows 8.1 and 10, older versions of Immunet such as 3.x only satisfies Virus protection but not Spyware and unwanted software protection in Action Center alerts on toolbar unlike other commercial antiviruses which satisfy both.

A \\"virtual scratch pad\\" enables users to compare data sets and create mashups. Graphs can be shared with links or embed codes, or exported in xml, json, or excel. Trendrr allows users to make real-time actions based on quantitative and qualitative trends by understanding social media's impact on sales, savings and brand equity—three sources through which Trendrr enables users to track ROI. History Wiredset, a digital marketing agency, created the first version of Trendrr called Infofilter in 2006. Infofilter pulled time-series data and pushed it into graphs and charts, without the interactive features such as mash-ups and scratch pad. The reporting function was manual, and access to the platform was deemed private. As the demand for the platform expanded beyond specific client needs, Infofilter evolved into Trendrr in April 2007. June 2009 saw the launch of Trendrr Pro, marking Trendrr's shift from a free service to a freemium model. In addition to the features included in the free version, Trendrr Pro allows users to track a greater number of data sets, receive unlimited alerts, and create custom reports. Users can also import their own data via Trendrr's API. Trendrr announced Curatorr as the latest addition to the Trendrr suite in February 2010. Curatorr is a real time dashboard that enables users to identify conversation around a topic. Users can search real-time Twitter conversation, filter the relevant conversation, and then publish the curated stream to television, phone, and internet. On January 22, 2010, Curatorr was used by MTV to filter and publish tweets during a live broadcast of the Hope for Haiti concert. Trendrr data has been cited by Reuters, the BBC, CBS, and the New York Times. Trendrr's charts are also featured in weekly columns in Advertising Age magazine, GigaOM.

When these instruments are panned, the moving image appears to roll over a curved, convex surface. In 1949, Horst Koehler at Zeiss (Jena) suggested adding some pincushion distortion to the optical design to eliminate the globe effect.H. Koehler, \\"Grundsaetzliches zum Fernrohrsehen\\", Deutsche Optische Wochenschrift 35, Vol. 6, p. 41 (1949). August Sonnefeld conducted experiments with volunteers, which supported the claim that a supplementary distortion could improve the imaging of visual optical instruments.A. Sonnefeld, \\"Ueber die Verzeichnung bei optischen Instrumenten, die in Verbindung mit dem blickenden Auge gebraucht werden\\", Deutsche Optische Wochenschrift 35, Vol. 13, p. 97 (1949). Since that time, most binocular manufacturers have followed Zeiss's example and added pincushion distortion to their optical design. The origin of the globe effect initially remained unclear after its discovery in the first half of the past century. Koehler speculated about an \\"unnatural perspective generated by the binocular while panning over a three dimensional scenery\\", thereby ignoring the fact that the globe effect was observable at the night sky as well, where perspective distortions were absent. Recently, the globe effect has been linked to the peculiar properties of human visual perception,H. Merlitz, \\"Distortion of binoculars revisited: Does the sweet spot exist?\\", JOSA A, Vol. 27, Issue 1, pp. 50-57 (2010). which adds a certain amount of barrel distortion to the visual field.A.H.J. Oomes, J.J. Koenderink, A.J. Doorn, H. de Ridder, \\"What are the uncurved lines in our visual field? A fresh look at Helmholtz's checkerboard\\", Perception 38, p. 1284 (2009). The amount of barrel distortion is subject to individual differences, which explains the fact that the perceived intensity of the globe effect varies significantly between different observers. An alternative approachErklärung des Globuseffekts, Walter E. Schön, http://www.juelich-bonn.com/jForum/read.php?9,288850,288850#msg-288850 for explaining the globe effect comes from the technical journalist and optics specialist Walter E. Schön. He states that the observed effect is in fact not that of a rolling globe but that of a vertically rotating cylinder. The globe shape of the illusion seen by most observers is only because the field of view through the optical device is circular. This illusion of a rotating cylinder during panning is caused by the horizontal movement of the image being (due to the angular magnification of the device) faster and more uniform (with less parallax) compared to the naked eye and also not corresponding to the felt rotational speed of the observer's head. When the brain tries to integrate these conflicting signals, it creates the perception that the image is moving slower at the left and right edges than in the middle, giving the illusion of a rotating cylinder.

A wine rating is a score assigned by one or more wine critics to a wine tasted as a summary of that critic's evaluation of that wine. A wine rating is therefore a subjective quality score, typically of a numerical nature, given to a specific bottle of wine. In most cases, wine ratings are set by a single wine critic, but in some cases a rating is derived by input from several critics tasting the same wine at the same time. A number of different scales for wine ratings are in use. Also, the practices used to arrive at the rating can vary. Over the last couple of decades, the 50–100 scale introduced by Robert M. Parker, Jr. has become commonly used. This or numerically similar scales are used by publications such as Wine Enthusiast, Wine Spectator, and Wine Advocate.Wine Enthusiast Magazine \\"About Wine Enthusiast's Rating System\\" Accessed: Nov 18, 2013The Wine Advocate \\"The Wine Advocate's Rating System\\" Accessed: Jan 16, 2010Wine Spectator \\"Wine Spectator Tasting Procedures and Taster Profiles\\" Accessed: Jan 16, 2010 Other publications or critics, such as Jancis Robinson and Michael Broadbent, may use a 0–20 scale, or a 0–5 scale (often in terms of numbers of stars) either with or without half-star steps.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Wine Course Third Edition pp. 19, 283–286 Abbeville Press 2003 In recent years, with the advent of aggregated user-generated ratings, there has also proliferated group rating systems, such as the one employed by CellarTracker, using input from non-professional wine tasters who taste under differing conditions. In addition to a simple numerical score, most wine ratings are meant to supplement the wine tasting notes, which are brief descriptions of the wine critic's overall impression of the wine, including its flavor qualities. However, often the emphasis (in particular in marketing) is on the score applied by a critic rather than on the total wine tasting note.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pp. 616–617 Oxford University Press 2006 History American wine critic Robert Parker is credited with popularizing the use of numerical wine ratings. While the composition of tasting notes and other forms of wine literature has existed throughout the history of wine, the widespread use of numerical rating systems is a relatively recent phenomenon. During the mid 20th century, as American interest in wine was developing, consumers found themselves being introduced to a wide assortment of wines from across the globe. This surplus of available options created a niche market for critics who could provide a service in reviewing wines and making recommendations that could make the buying process easier for consumers. Following a pattern similar to the product reviews of such consumer magazines like Consumer Reports and Which?, American critics began writing more condensed wine reviews that consumers could scan through briefly to identify wines of interest. The popularization of numerical scoring is widely credited to the American wine critic Robert Parker who patterned his system of numerical ratings on the American standardized grading system in the 1970s.R. Nalley \\"Wine ratings: Are they help or hindrance to shoppers?\\" Schenectady Gazette, April 1, 1988 Under Parker's system, wines were evaluated on a 50–100 scale that roughly correlated to an A–F \\"grade\\" on the wine. A wine was considered \\"above average\\" or \\"good\\" if it got a score of at least 85 points. Readers of wine rating magazines such as Parker's The Wine Advocate, or its later imitators such as Wine Spectator and The Wine Enthusiast, could quickly at glance see a review of several dozen or even hundreds of available wines broken down into numerical evaluations. These consumers could isolate a range of scores to concentrate their buying purchase on without ever having to try a wine beforehand. Similarly, wine retailers and merchants found themselves with a ready made marketing tool that didn't even require them to research or sample the wine before they put it on sale. The popularity of numerical wine ratings became a boon for the wine retailing industry. Wines that received scores classified as \\"outstanding\\" (usually 90 points or above) were essentially guaranteed favorable sales in the market. Wines that received \\"extraordinary\\" or \\"classic\\" ratings of 95–100 began to develop cult followings that, coupled with the limited production, helped to skyrocket their prices. A segment of investment wine emerged that aimed to capitalize on the speculation and eventual price increase surrounding highly scoring wines. The influence of wine ratings was particularly keen in the developing wine markets of Asia, Russia and South America at the turn of the 21st century. Criticism Critics of numerical wine ratings have contended that the popularity and marketing power of these ratings have contributed to a homogenization of wine styles being offered on the market. The numerical wine rating system has been heavily criticized.Staff Reports \\"Wine-Rating Publications: Their Benefits and Pitfalls, Part I\\" The Record Searchlight, December 24, 2008D. DeSimone \\"Wine rating system doesn't point to perfection\\" Pittsburgh Tribune, April 13, 2005G. Rivlin \\"Wine-rating system is not improving with age\\" The New York Times, August 14, 2006W. Blake-Gray \\"Are ratings pointless?\\" San Francisco Chronicle, June 14, 2007 It has been considered a driving force in the globalization of wine and the down playing of the influence of terroir and individuality in wine making. Critics of the wine rating system contend that the economic and marketing power of receiving favorable scores by influential critics has steered global winemaking towards producing a homogeneous style that is perceived as appealing to the critics. These critics point to what they contend is an inherent flaw in sampling a wide assortment of wines at once. When compared together, wines (particular red) that have deep colors, full bodied, stronger, concentrated flavors and smooth mouthfeel tend to stand out from the assortment more than wines with more subtle characteristics. These wines tend to receive more favorable wine ratings which have led to an increase in the proliferation of these styles of wines on the market. ReferencesExternal links * R.

The dry forests cover the western side of Grand Terre, New Caledonia's largest island. Geography The New Caledonia dry forests cover an area of 4,129 km². Grand Terre extends northwest-southeast, and a long spine of mountains extend the length of the island. The dry forests lie in the drier rain shadow of mountains. The New Caledonia rain forests ecoregion covers the rest of the island, including the eastern slope and high mountains. Nouméa, New Caledonia's capital and largest city, is located on the coast in the southern portion of the ecoregion. Flora The natural vegetation of the ecoregion's lowlands is dense dry forest, also known as sclerophyll forest, with trees 5 to 15 meters high. The forests have a thick understory of shrubs and herbaceous plants, and numerous vines climb into the trees. Acacia spirorbis is a characteristic tree, and the introduced tree Leucaena leucocephala is often co-dominant. Other common trees include species of Canthium, Gardenia, Pittosporum, Dodonaea, and Premna. The cycad Cycas seemannii grows in stands on stabilized coastal dunes. The other conifers so characteristic of New Caledonia's rain forests don't occur in the dry forests. The dry forests are home to 407 woody plant species, 243 of which are endemic to New Caledonia and 60 endemic to the dry forests. Dry-forest endemic trees include Ixora margaretae and Terminalia cherrieri.\\"New Caledonia\\". Tropical dry forests of the Pacific. Accessed 5 September 2020. http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/geog/tdfpacific/new_caledonia.html Protected areas Frequent fires and clearance for agriculture and cattle raising have reduced the dry forest to scattered patches which cover only 2% of the ecoregion's land area. A 2017 assessment found that 2,451 km², or 59%, of the ecoregion is now in protected areas. Very little intact habitat remains outside the protected areas. The largest protected area is Zone Côtière Ouest National Park (2552.68 km²), which covers the central portion of the ecoregion and extends east into the rain forests ecoregion.UNEP-WCMC (2020).

It was a single-seat, low-wing cantilever monoplane with retractable landing gear. Only two prototypes were built, one designated F.6M and the other designated F.6Z. Development=F.6M The Caproni Vizzola F.6M prototype as originally built with a deep radiator under the nose. It was later removed and replaced by a ventral radiator in order to reduce aerodynamic drag. The F.6 design was the result of a project to adapt the airframe of the Italian Caproni Vizzola F.5 fighter with the German Daimler- Benz DB 605A liquid-cooled inverted V-12 engine. To accomplish this, the Caproni company retained the F.5 fuselage but designed metal wings to replace the wood wings of the F.5. The new aircraft was designated F.6M, with \\"F\\" standing for Fabrizi, the designer of the F.5, and \\"M\\" for Metallico. It was designed to carry twice the offensive armament of the F.5, with four instead of two Breda-SAFAT machine guns; the prototype F.6M flew with two of these mounted in the fuselage and provision for two more in the wings, although the wing guns were never mounted.Green and Swanborough, p. 109 The F.6M prototype first flew in September 1941, using a large radiator mounted under the nose, just behind the propeller. Flight testing showed that this location produced significant aerodynamic drag, and the prototype was reworked to mount the radiator on the belly, aft of the pilot position. The sole F.6M prototype was damaged in a collision at Bresso airfield. After this accident, Caproni decided to end the F.6M project and instead concentrate on the more advanced Caproni Vizzola F.7 fighter.The Caproni Vizzola F.6Z prototype. F.6Z Shortly after Caproni began to design the F.6M, it began work on a second F.6 prototype, this one designed to use the Isotta-Fraschini Zeta R.C.25/60 24-cylinder X-type engine and designated the F.6Z, with \\"Z\\" standing for Zeta. The aircraft was to carry three Breda-SAFAT machine guns, one in the fuselage and two in the wings. Problems with engine development greatly delayed the F.6Z, but it finally flew in August 1943. Testing in August and September 1943 showed that the Zeta engine, although rated at 1,100 kilowatts (1,500 horsepower), was producing only 900 kilowatts (1,200 horsepower), and this problem was not solved before the World War II Italian armistice with the Allies on 8 September 1943. This brought the F.6Z project to an end. The sole F.6Z prototype was the only fighter to be powered by the Zeta engine.Green and Swanborough, p. 110 One other fighter type, the Reggiane Re.2004 was also planned with this engine, but was not realized.Pietro Prato: Caccia Caproni Reggiane 1938-1945, Interconair, Genf, 1971 (Italian) Operators ; *Regia Aeronautica Variants ;F.6M :First prototype, powered by a German-built Daimler-Benz DB 605A engine ;F.6Z :Second prototype, powered by an Isotta- Fraschini Zeta R.C.25/60 engine ;F.7 :An extensively revised F.6 powered by a 1,175 h.p.

He is currently Political Correspondent for RTÉ News and Current Affairs. He has regularly reported on conflicts, natural disasters and other matters outside the EU. Most recently he reported from Iran, Ukraine and Iraq. He has won multiple awards for his work. Cunningham has also written two books, including Ireland's Burning. Career=Early career Cunningham started to write articles for local newspapers in Dublin, before freelancing with the Irish Times and Irish Press. Quickly he began to pick up freelance shifts on RTÉ Radio 1 and RTÉ 2FM as a sub-editor and news-reader. After 2 years, he was appointed to the RTÉ Newsroom as a reporter. Lindsay Tribunal From 1999 to 2001, Paul Cunningham reported on the infection of Irish people with haemophilia, with HIV, and with Hepatitis C from contaminated blood products. In recognition, he won \\"National Radio Journalist of the Year\\" in the ESB National Media Awards in 2000. He followed this up with a documentary exposing the practices of US- based drug firms that exported infected blood products to Ireland. The programme, Bad Blood, won an Irish Film and Television Award. He co-wrote a book, with Rosemary Daly, on the impact of contaminated blood products called A Case of Bad Blood for Poolbeg Press. Foreign Coverage Cunningham has reported extensively from abroad. His first assignment was on the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. He followed up with reports on numerous conflicts including Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Lebanon, Kosovo, Algeria, Pakistan/Afghanistan, Guatemala, Nepal, Darfur and Chad.

In 2008, after Cunningham interviewed civil servant Padraig O hUiginn for the same series, Sunday Independent columnist Brendan O'Connor compared Cunningham to the hero in US television series Columbo: \\"seemingly awkward, nerdy and self-effacing and merely innocently asking odd questions, while all the time letting his subject reveal himself\\". Environment Correspondent As RTÉ's Environment Correspondent, between 2001 and 2010, Cunningham regularly reported on climate change. In October 2006, he reported and blogged on the melting of glaciers in Greenland for RTÉ. In 2008 Cunningham travelled to Chad to film a series of reports on the country for RTÉ. Cunningham covered the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference for RTÉ. He also reported from the UNFCCC meetings in Bali (2007) and Montreal (2005).

In 2014 he broadcast a series of reports from Iran, as the provisional nuclear deal with the West came into operation. Political Correspondent He is currently Political Correspondent for RTÉ News and Current Affairs. Hat In January 2010 Cunningham became known for his choice of hat which, according to the journalist himself via Twitter, is from \\"Pakistan's tribal areas\\". He wore the hat during a live television news report for RTÉ outside Government Buildings during the January 2010 weather emergency in Europe. The hat has been described variously as a “woolly pancake”, an “Aran Smurf’s hat” and “stylish, in a French pastry kind of way”. A Facebook group dedicated to the hat had more than one thousand fans within hours of the hat's television debut. Observers noted that Cunningham's hat did indeed resemble a pakul, a traditional men's hat worn in the Chitral and Gilgit regions of Pakistan. Some of these fans met up outside Government Buildings wearing their own hats in a similar manner. RTÉ.ie even referenced the hat in their own weather updates. The hat was auctioned for GOAL on radio programme Mooney on January 21, 2010 to raise funds for the 2010 Haiti earthquake appeal: the hat was purchased after some \\"frenzied bidding\\" for €570 by a member of \\"We love Paul Cunningham's winter hat\\" Facebook society. Cunningham had responded after Derek Mooney said he would auction his own jumper on air.

It is the first official DC crossover between the DC Universe and the Looney Tunes characters. Plot=The DC Superheroes Meet the Looney Tunes! In Metropolis, Clark Kent and Lois Lane are investigating reports of a mysterious giant plane (the work of the villainous Toyman) when they encounter Mr. Mxyzptlk. He causes a 'Czarbucks' coffee shop to grow out of the ground like a plant and begins to \\"seed\\" the whole city with similar pointless businesses. Clark switches to Superman to pursue him, but ultimately uses his civilian identity to trick Mxyzptlk into saying his name backwards (by getting him to read a list to which Clark has added \\"Kltpzyxm\\"). Meanwhile, \\"in a forest on the edge of some other city in some other universe\\", Elmer Fudd corners Bugs Bunny. When he tries to shoot Bugs, though, his bullets turn into flowers. This is the work of Yoyo the Dodo, who has left Wackyland via a dimensional transporter in search of people to annoy, but is feeling inadequate due to the fact everyone in the Looney Tunes' world is already crazy. The transporter is not working, leaving him unable to search elsewhere. Inspired by a Superman comic, Bugs tricks Yoyo into saying \\"Od-od\\" (Do-do backwards), which sends him to another dimension. During their respective trips, Mxyzptlk and Yoyo collide and crash-land in yet another dimension. When Mxyzptlk learns that the world Yoyo just left has no superheroes, they build a larger transporter so Mxyzptlk can go to the Looney Tunes' world and cause chaos there. However, he soon learns why Yoyo left when he encounters Foghorn Leghorn (who pies him in the face), Daffy Duck (who drops an anvil on him) and the Tasmanian Devil (who tries to eat him). Mxyzptlk's disappointment is short-lived, as he then comes up with a plan to cause chaos in the DC Universe by sending the Looney Tunes there. Soon the DC superheroes are encountering the Looney Tunes; Green Lantern catches Marvin the Martian plotting to destroy Earth on the Moon, the Flash finds himself racing Speedy Gonzales and later the Road Runner (the latter being pursued by Wile E. Coyote), Plastic Man disguises himself as a cat to spy on a cat-loving gangster only to be romanced by Pepé Le Pew before encountering Sylvester and Tweety, Aquaman is nearly blown out of the water by Yosemite Sam's pirate ship and Batman, on the trail of the Penguin, instead finds Playboy Penguin. The Looney Tunes do not find this unusual, but the fact that they only appear briefly and then vanish means that the superheroes are soon questioning their own sanity. Meanwhile, Mxyzptlk plots to cause even more havoc by swapping Superman with Elmer Fudd. The Wast Son of Kwypton! Mr. Mxyzptlk and the Do-do's partnership turns sour (mostly because the Do-do keeps playing pranks on Mxyzptlk) as the DC superheroes continue to encounter the Looney Tunes - Batman and Plastic Man team up to defeat the Penguin and the gangster Plastic Man was tailing only to meet Charlie Dog immediately afterwards. Meanwhile, Bugs Bunny disguises himself as a park ranger and makes Elmer Fudd perform several embarrassing stunts (including wearing a clown suit) to earn a \\"wabbit hunting license\\" before Fudd realizes that he has been fooled (because the stunts are actually to get a FISHING license) and angrily chases Bugs. At this point, Mxyzptlk and the Do-do effect their plan. In the Daily Planet office Clark Kent wants to go rabbit hunting while Bugs is confused by Fudd wearing Superman's costume and reciting heroic monologues. While Perry White encounters Henery Hawk (who believes Perry to be a chicken due to Perry using the term in an argument regarding his courage), news suddenly comes in that the Toyman's giant plane is attacking Metropolis. Mxyzptlk and the Do-do arrange for the broadcast to be heard in the Looney Tunes' world as well, prompting Fudd to fly to the rescue with a terrified Bugs (who sarcastically asked to accompany him, believing Fudd was delusional) in tow. Meanwhile, Kent attempts to switch to Superman, only to discover that he is now wearing Fudd's clown suit and has no superpowers. Daffy Duck, Porky Pig and Foghorn Leghorn witness the chaos on the streets and note how \\"weird and dark and scary!\\" the DC Universe is before Daffy is suddenly teleported away (the Do-do intends to swap him for Batman). Fudd and Bugs have been transported to Metropolis, where Fudd lands on the plane to confront the Toyman's goons who, like the general public, are confused to see Superman shorter than usual and accompanied by a cartoon rabbit. On the Toyman's orders, the goons prepare to fire a deadly cannon. The Duck Knight Weturns! Green Arrow meets Junior Bear and is given a box that turns out to contain Michigan J. Frog, whose tendency to sing and dance for only one person causes several people to doubt his sanity. Elmer Fudd, meanwhile, survives being blasted by the Toyman's goons. The cannon is calibrated for the real Superman and the blast goes harmlessly over the much shorter Fudd's head, while Mr. Mxyzptlk gets angry when he finds out that the Do-do swapped Daffy Duck and Batman without his say-so. The two pranksters start fighting and part of the transporter machine gets damaged, causing the Fudd/Superman switch to be undone and leaving Fudd cowering in terror as the goons prepare to shoot him. Luckily, Bugs Bunny rescues Fudd by tricking the goons into arguing and shooting each other, but this leaves the plane spiralling out of control. Clark Kent is watching helplessly from the street when Foghorn Leghorn (who is a fan of Action Comics) recognises him and encourages him to change to Superman, tearing off Kent's shirt for him and revealing that his costume and superpowers have been restored. The Man of Steel rescues Bugs, Fudd and the unconscious goons and crashes the plane harmlessly in the ocean. In Gotham City, Commissioner Gordon calls Batman only for Daffy to turn up wearing his costume. He heads off to investigate a lead on stolen mechanical parts while Batman puts on a spare Bat-suit and wonders why he wants to fly south for the winter. Mxyzptlk has tied up the Do-do and taken control of the whole process, only for the transporter (sabotaged by the Do-do) to blow up in his face. This causes the Justice League (consisting of: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern, Flash, Aquaman, Green Arrow and Plastic Man) and several Looney Tunes (consisting of: Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd, Porky Pig, Foghorn Leghorn, Speedy Gonzales, Pepé Le Pew, Taz, Yosemite Sam, Sylvester and Tweety) to find themselves in the same location. Discussing what has happened so far, they realize that their two realities are being merged and, when Superman mentions Mxyzptlk and Foghorn remembers meeting him, suspicions arise that he is responsible. Checking the new broadcasts, they discover a more immediate threat - three of the Toyman's deadly giant toys are attacking the Federal Reserves. The Justice League prepare to head to the rescue, but Bugs convinces them to let him and the other Looney Tunes accompany them (after all, they too have done heroic things in their time). Superman appoints them honorary Justice League members. While Mxyzptlk tries to fix the transporter, the Do-do breaks free and declares that, as he belongs in neither the Looney Tunes' world nor the DC Universe, he will instead merge the two universes forever. Cwisis on Infinite Earths! The Justice League and the Looney Tunes split up into three teams to take out the Toyman's machines: Superman, Flash, Green Arrow, Elmer Fudd, Foghorn Leghorn and Pepé Le Pew encounter a tank with a cannon powerful enough to incapacitate Superman. Flash warns the Looney Tunes to stay back, but Foghorn wants to help. After hearing Fudd and Pepé argue about Pepé's smell, he comes up with \\"an idea so good, I wish I could steal it from myself!\\" They get Green Arrow to shoot an arrow Pepé is clinging onto into the tank, causing the goons inside to rapidly evacuate to escape the cartoon skunk's stench. Batman, Green Lantern, Plastic Man, Bugs Bunny, Speedy Gonzales and Taz face a giant toy soldier that knocks Green Lantern unconscious and causes him to fall. Speedy quickly stretches Plastic Man into a safety net to rescue the Emerald Gladiator while Bugs convinces Taz to eat one of the robot's feet, causing the whole thing to fall over. Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, Porky Pig, Yosemite Sam, Sylvester and Tweety run into a robotic dragon that easily bests Martian Manhunter with its fiery breath and grabs Wonder Woman and Aquaman. Tweety angrily flies at the dragon and finds himself inside it with the piloting goons. They ignore Tweety, believing him to be harmless, but Tweety starts pressing every button and pulling every switch that he can find, causing the dragon to shake itself to bits. Meanwhile, Mr. Mxyzptlk tricks the Do-do into trusting him again and proceeds to tie him up a second time before embarking on the \\"merge the two universes forever\\" plan himself. Daffy Duck, still believing he is Batman, finds the Toyman. The criminal easily convinces him to join his organization with a job offer (and a very large salary), but just as they shake on it they find themselves transported through dimensions (their hands get stuck together thanks to some superglue Daffy got himself covered in earlier). The furious Toyman prepares to shoot Daffy, but is put off the idea by the revelation that all the other Looney Tunes and the DC superheroes are all there too. After the Toyman surrenders and is arrested, Bugs and Superman start wondering how they can get everyone home before it is revealed they are all at Mxyzptlk's base. He gleefully threatens to merge the Looney Tunes' world and the DC Universe into one forever, much to the terror of the Looney Tunes (who all note how many problems the DC Universe has). While Superman and Batman waste time wondering what to do, Bugs takes action. He pretends to congratulate Mxyzptlk, convincing him to brag of his victory by posting it on the popular website \\"www.kltpzyxm.com\\"; when Mxyzptlk says it aloud he is transported back to the Fifth Dimension. Freed, the Do-do resets the machine to separate the two universes forever, announcing he intends to stay to run amok in the DC Universe and sending the Looney Tunes home because \\"I don't need the competition\\". Superman and Bugs Bunny shake hands as they leave, the Man of Steel commenting that the Looney Tunes are real superheroes. Back at the Daily Planet, Clark Kent reads a Looney Tunes comic and happily notes that Bugs and the others are back home before being sent on another assignment by Perry White. Perry notices that Kent has left a mysterious box on his desk and opens it out of curiosity, revealing Michigan J. Frog. Perry dreams of fame and fortune with the frog while, back in the Looney Tunes' world, Bugs reads the scene in a Superman comic and glumly foretells the disappointment that awaits Perry. Daffy wonders aloud whether people in the DC Universe would believe what has happened if they knew the truth, to which Bugs replies \\"Let's put it this way - they'd believe that before they'll believe what Perry White's gonna try and tell them!\\" as Porky signs off with his classic \\"Th-th-th-that's all, folks!\\" ReferencesExternal links *Superman & Bugs Bunny #1 review *Superman & Bugs Bunny #2 review *Superman & Bugs Bunny #3 review *Superman & Bugs Bunny #4 review Category:DC Comics storylines Category:Crossover comics Category:Intercompany crossovers Category:Superman titles Category:Looney Tunes ","title":"Superman &amp; Bugs Bunny"},{"id":"25788219","text":"The Theater at Blessed Sacrament, formerly the Arclight Theatre and currently known as Theatre 71 at Blessed Sacrament, is located at 152 West 71st Street, between Broadway and Columbus Avenues.

He began school in Bayreuth in 1912, studying mechanical engineering. After several attempts to volunteer for service at the beginning of World War I, he was accepted by the pioneers at Ingolstadt.Der Logbuch website He trained in Darmstadt in 1916; one of his schoolmates from high school, Richard Wenzl, trained with him there and would also become an ace. Weiss began his aerial service as an observer gunner in artillery cooperation units FF(A) 282, FF(A) 28, and FFA 68 during June 1916. At that time, he was a corporal. During a reconnaissance flight, he was wounded in the foot by anti-aircraft fire though flying at nearly 9,000 feet. Upon recovery, he was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class. On a later mission, on 26 May 1917, he bombed an enemy supply train, breaking it in half; he then continued the attack despite ground fire from machine guns and infantry. For this feat, he won the Iron Cross First Class and was promoted to sergeant. Service as a fighter pilot Then, in August 1917, he was sent to Jastashule in Valenciennes. By the following month, he was already flying a fighter for Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 41; he scored his first victory on the 17th. Weiss was then commissioned a leutnant in October 1917.

He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1907 until his death and was the Minister for Public Health for 4 months in 1927. He was a member of the Labor Party. Biography Stuart- Robertson was born in Booligal and was the son of Robert John Stuart Robertson, a self-proclaimed doctor, and Catherine Eleanor JOYCE. Stuart- Robertson's birth date has been claimed as 10 August 1874, however the date of 16 September 1866 is evidenced by his official birth record. He was educated to elementary level at Bourke, where his family moved after his father's alleged death when Stuart-Robertson was 4 years old. Despite the rumour that Robert senior had died during the 1870s in Queensland, Robert senior died on 3 July 1899 at George Street Asylum, Parramatta, New South Wales. Stuart- Robertson undertook a number of unsuccessful retail businesses in Bourke and Cobar. During this time he became active in the ALP and was a delegate to the annual State Labor Conference. In 1905 he moved to Sydney and worked as a shop assistant. He helped to found the Shop Assistants Union. At the 1907 general election, he was the Australian Labor Party candidate for the Legislative Assembly seat of Camperdown and defeated the sitting member James Smith. The seat of Camperdown was abolished when NSW elections were conducted using proportional representation with multi-member seats between 1920 and 1927. During this time Stuart-Robertson was the ALP member for Balmain. With the reintroduction of single member seats in 1927 he became the member for Annandale, which he represented until his death. Stuart-Robertson remained loyal to the party leader, Jack Lang during the numerous and complex schisms that occurred in the NSW branch of the party in the 1920s and 30s (see Lang Labor). Lang described him as a \\"strait-laced reformer\\" who dressed in a deacon's coat and objected to the advertising of alcohol. As a result, he was unpopular in caucus and his only ministerial appointment was as Minister for Health in a caretaker government prior to the 1927 election. Lang formed this government solely from his supporters when he encountered significant opposition from the caucus elected cabinet. Stuart-Robertson, under the pen name of \\"D Ross\\" and at the time Secretary of the Cobar School of Arts, authored a novel entitled A Woman (A Tale of Australian Life in the Early Fifties), published in 1901 by J A Bradley of the Cobar Leader office, Barton Street, Cobar, New South Wales. A copy of this book is held in the rare books section of the Mitchell Library, New South Wales.

In 2012, Corral directed and produced a documentary film, Tom Wolfe Gets Back to Blood, which enjoyed a national run on PBS and was screened in more than 40 independent theaters around the country. It is the only film ever made about Tom Wolfe, an iconic author and satirist whose stature in American letters has loomed large for the last half century. The film is about how Wolfe researched his Miami-set novel, Back to Blood, in South Florida. Through his own media production company, Explica Media Solutions, Corral has partnered with, and worked for, many news organizations, including the Miami Herald, which premiered an 18-part video series about invasive Burmese pythons in 2014.Miami Herald That series, later rebranded Exotic Invaders: Pythons in the Everglades, premiered on PBS nationally in 2015 and is available on Netflix. The film won an Emmy award for environmental films. Corral also completed a documentary film about undocumented child immigrants, The Crossfire Kids, in 2014. That film aired on South Florida PBS affiliate WPBT2 and received an Emmy nomination. Corral is a former Miami Herald journalist who triggered a firestorm among Cuban exiles in Miami with his reporting about government funding for Radio and TV Marti and other U.S. government programs to promote democracy in Cuba. His controversial stories have been the subject of several studies and analyses, most recently by Columbia University, which used them as a basis for an ethical case study. Corral also played major roles in the coverage of other big stories in Miami, including the fall of Miami Commissioner Arthur Teele, the case of Cuban exile militant Luis Posada Carriles, and multiple state and national political campaigns. His short-lived blog, Miami's Cuban Connection, enjoyed a burst of popularity in 2006 before fading into internet limbo, where it lives on in the Miami Herald's archives. It has not been updated for several years.  Biography  Corral is the 2nd child of Oscar Jose Corral-Corral and Maria Caridad Parlade y Fernandez de Castro, Cuban exiles. He graduated in 1992 from Belen Jesuit Preparatory School in Miami. Corral later graduated from the University of Florida's journalism program, and won first place in the Hearst National Writing Awards in 1998 with an article about the budding medical marijuana scene in San Francisco that year. After winning the Hearst award, The Chicago Tribune recruited Corral for an internship at the storied newspaper. While working in Tribune tower, Corral researched and broke several stories, including an in- depth scoop on a legal fight over the estate of Beat Generation Author and Poet, Jack Kerouac. Titled \\"Fighting Over Jack\\", the article reported that Kerouac's estate was worth just $91 at the time of his death, but had grown to be valued at more than $10 million, triggering a legal struggle for control.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-08-05/features/9808050272_1_stella- sampas-john-sampas-gerald-nicosia After completing his master's degree in International Relations at Florida International University, Corral moved to New York City to work for Newsday, where he covered crime for the Pulitzer- prize winning tabloid. While at Newsday, Corral worked on several high-profile stories, including the case of Reyna Angelica Marroquin, a Salvadoran immigrant to New York who disappeared in 1969.http://www.newsday.com/long- island/li-life/case-closed-newly-retired-robert-edwards-of-the-nassau- homicide-squad-reflects-on-matters-of-life-and- death-1.799412http://www.newsday.com/news/science-clinches-casepainstaking- analysis-of-the-victim-s-address-book-1.339100 Her mummified body was discovered inside a metal drum below a Long Island mansion 30 years later.

The case was also featured on 48 Hourshttp://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/03/07/48hours/main168984.shtml and became the backdrop for an episode of Law & Order. Corral returned to his native Miami in 2001, just weeks before the September 11 attacks, and was quickly assigned to the story's Florida angle by his new employer, The Miami Herald. He and a team of other journalists won a Green Eyeshade Award from the Society of Professional Journalists for their coverage of the terrorists' movements in Florida in the weeks leading up to the attacks.http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-1797608/SPJ-names-2002-Green- Eyeshade.html His first beat was Miami City Hall, where the mayoral campaign immediately following the Elian Gonzalez fiasco was in full swing. Incumbent Joe Carollo was defeated by Manny Diaz, a local lawyer who had represented Elian's Miami relatives.http://www.governing.com/topics/politics/Miami- Inc.html Corral's coverage of City Hall culminated with a series of investigative articles about Miami Commissioner Arthur Teele. Teele was eventually indicted on federal and state corruption charges and shot himself to death in the lobby of the Miami Herald building. Corral appears in a documentary on Teele's rise and fall, Miami Noir.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1246589/ Corral covered the 2003-2004 presidential primary of Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman, following Al Gore's former running mate for months as he combed New Hampshire and other early-voting states pining for votes. He also covered the failed gubernatorial campaign of former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno,http://www.puertorico- herald.org/issues/2002/vol6n35/FLGubCand-en.html and the failed campaign of presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani in Florida in 2008.http://eyeonmiami.blogspot.com/2008/01/miami-herald-whats-with-guiliani- ronald.html In 2005, Corral and several colleagues drove an RV packed with supplies to Biloxi, and then on to New Orleans in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.HighBeam Corral spent a week living in the destroyed Radisson downtown with other journalists, covering the unrest and chaos that followed the historic storm.http://www.mail- archive.com/helptheanimals@yahoogroups.com/msg00654.html Corral was eventually asked to cover the contentious Cuban exile politics beat and launched a blog called Miami's Cuban Connection, which grew steadily in popularity until 2007, when Corral moved on to another beat.http://blogs.herald.com/cuban_connection/ He covered the story of Luis Posada Carriles, a Cuban exile militant and accused terrorist who slipped past Homeland Security to sneak into Miami in 2005.http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB153/index.htm Corral and colleague Alfonso Chardy were the first journalists in the United States to find and interview Posada on American Soil.http://www.miamiherald.com/2005/05/17/v-fullstory/79747/flashback-posada- speaks-to-herald.html Posada was arrested by federal authorities soon after and has been in federal detention since then. Posada has been accused of masterminding the bombing of a Cuban passenger jet in 1976, which killed 74 people, including several children.http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB157/index.htm Corral and Chardy were awarded first place in the Sunshine State awardshttp://spjsofla.net/wp-content/themes/mimbo2.2/images/2006-sunshine- state-awards-winners.pdf for their reporting on the Posada story. The Miami Herald nominated the duo for a Pulitzer Prize that year. In September 2006, Corral published what would become the most controversial investigative article of his career. It unleashed a firestorm in the Cuban exile community and turned Corral into a target for death threats, slander and undaunted libel. According to Columbia University Professor Kirsten Lundberg, who turned the case into a 30-page journalism ethics case study, the event can be used to discuss strategic management at both an editorial and ownership level. \\"Students can gain understanding of the relationship between newspaper owners, their publishers and their editors. The case also raises for discussion ethnic issues in the newsroom. How should managers approach ethnic diversity in a newsroom if that becomes a tripwire for anger and hostility.\\" According to Lundberg > \\"On September 8, 2006, the Miami Herald ran a Page One story titled “10 > Miami journalists take U.S. pay.” The story by Oscar Corral reported that > Miami-area journalists had accepted money from Radio/TV Martí, a US > government-run broadcast targeted at the communist nation of Cuba. Three of > the 11 journalists named in the story worked for El Nuevo Herald, a Spanish- > language newspaper also owned by the Miami Herald Publishing Company.

The Miami Herald reportedly moved Corral and his family into a secure location with 24-hour security for two months.https://groups.yahoo.com/group/CubaNews/message/69532 Corral continued working on investigative stories on how the United States government was spending hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money to promote democracy in Cuba. From September through December of that year, Corral published another 5 investigative articles on the topic. They ultimately led to the departure of USAID's Cuba program director. A TV Marti executive was also indicted on corruption charges in the aftermath of the articles. Much of the money was flowing into local media organizations, and never made it to Cuba. Corral was targeted by many on local Spanish-language radio and television with insults and as Miami Herald editor Tom Fiedler put it at the time, \\"blood libel.\\" During his years as a journalist at the Miami Herald, Corral twice made the Miami New Times’ annual “Best Of Miami” edition. In 2004, he reported the “Best Quote,” which was attributed to Miami Police Chief John Timoney. It reads: “It's always threat-level orange when John Timoney opens his mouth. But this inspired utterance, issued while he was on a bike tour of the anti-free-trade protest zone in downtown Miami this past November, rocketed the churlish chief well into the red zone. Perhaps he was drunk from the $8.5 million the Department of Homeland Security allotted the Magic City police force to fend off opponents of the Free Trade Association of the Americas. \\"You're bad. Fuck you!\\" he yelled at a young male demonstrator as undercover cops shoved the lad against a car to arrest him. Scrappy Miami Herald reporter Oscar Corral, who was bicycle-embedded with Timoney when he snagged the quote, slammed it into the lead sentence of his story, right where it belonged. Timoney later denied saying \\"You're bad,\\" insisting that he doesn't talk like that. But he may have blurted the \\"Fuck you\\" part, he allowed with a chuckle. The prudish daily softened the f-word to \\"f---\\" on the printed page, but that didn't keep this quote from ricocheting into a revealing metaphor of the man Miami pays to keep the peace.”http://www.miaminewtimes.com/bestof/2004/award/best-quote-16576/ In 2007, Corral was named by Miami New Times as “Best Commie Agent”, an ironic allusion to the extensive slander and libel that befell Corral following his investigations of how the U.S. government was misspending hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to promote democracy in Cuba. It reads: “That damn Oscar Corral. First he writes a story informing Miami residents that ten South Florida journalists are on the payrolls of U.S. propaganda vehicles Radio and TV Martí. Then he has the nerve to tell us that none of the $55.5 million in taxpayer money intended to fund Cuban dissidents has reached the island in cash. Instead the bulk was spent in Miami and Washington, or on exorbitant bills to ship goods to the island. And then he reports that most of that local spending was done without oversight or competitive bidding, and that the goods purchased for anti-Castro activists to foster democracy included Nintendo Game Boys, a chainsaw, Sony PlayStations, cashmere sweaters, a mountain bike, Godiva chocolates, and crabmeat. He may have been leaking fecal matter and stuffed with tubes, but there was only one man behind this, and he wears an Adidas track jacket and has a beard. Thank God for the freelance columnist at El Nuevo Herald, Nicolas Perez Diaz-Arguelles, who finally put two and two together and took the leap of faith to insinuate what was on all of our minds: Oscar Corral is a Cuban spy. The writer's editor may have cried \\"blood libel,\\" but when it comes down to it, newspapers are irrelevant to a democracy. Eating truffles while playing Grand Theft Auto, That's a slap in Castro's face.”http://www.miaminewtimes.com/bestof/2007/award/best-commie-agent-483433/ Corral remained silent during most of the controversy, and focused instead on completing the multi-part investigative series. Eventually, he granted an interview to fellow Miami journalist Rebecca Wakefield, a former New Times writer who was working for the SunPost. The article, titled \\"I Am Not A Communist\\", explains: \\"Oscar Corral dreamed of one day being hired by the Miami Herald. He never imagined it would come with an existential crisis.\\" Instead of lashing out at critics, Corral struck a humble tone, saying that his deep community roots in Miami made him sensitive to the Cuban exile community's passionate outlook on Cuba. \\"Corral, 32, is soft-spoken, thoughtful and earnest to a fault. He still looks like a Catholic school boy and has an almost ecclesiastical approach to journalism,\\" Wakefield wrote. In the interview, Corral revealed that The Miami Herald had moved him and his family out of his house as a precaution following a series of death threats.http://www.walterlippmann.com/docs1415.html Corral left the Miami Herald in 2008 to launch a multimedia production company. His first major project was the Wolfe documentary, Tom Wolfe Gets Back to Blood. He is now working on a documentary about the role immigrants have played in Miami.

The main source for his early life is a single document from Segovia dated 1148.Richard A. Fletcher, The Episcopate in the Kingdom of León in the Twelfth Century (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1978), 31 n2, cites it in D. de Colmenares, Historia de Segovia (Segovia, 1637), 134–35. From this it is known that he held the title of magister and was an Augustinian canon at Segovia before he was a bishop. He probably hailed from Navarre, as did many of the repobladores of the region of Segovia and Ávila.Fletcher, 31–32. At some point, \\"willing to lead a stricter life\\",Fletcher, 32: arctiorem vitam ducere volens. he founded a religious community at Párraces, probably composed of fellow Augustinians. There had been no bishop at Coria since 902 when, after re-conquering the city in June 1142 Alfonso VII of León re-established the diocese and appointed a bishop. Navarro was referred to as novo ordinato (newly ordained) in a royal document issued 30 August. The Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris, in relating the conquest of Coria, notes that \\"a church was dedicated there in honor of Saint Mary and all the saints [and] they consecrated as bishop a pious man whose name was Navarro\\" (II, §161). A document of 3 October lists the properties to be given to the new diocese. Navarro appears to have passed most of his episcopate in his diocese, perhaps because the state of affairs required constant attendance, and so he is an obscure figure, confirming only five known royal documents during his time ruling the see of Coria, which was then the newest and poorest diocese in the kingdom. In 1148 Navarro attended the Council of Reims and afterwards remained with the Curia romana for some time. Pope Eugenius III wrote a letter to Alfonso VII explaining the arrangement: \\"We wish it be made known that we have led the bishop of Coria to stay with us, because at that time the church to which he is commissioned had been pressed into grave poverty, as we believe, and he cannot there exercise his office usefully, because then we trust that your munificence to him should honourably provide the necessities.\\"Fletcher, 32: notum fieri volumus quod Cauriensern episcopum nobiscum duximus retinendum, tum quia in ecclesia que sibi commissa est gravi inopia sicut accepimus premebatur et officium suum ibi exercere utiliter non poterat, tum quia confidimus quod munificentia tua suis debeat necessitatibus honestius providere. In 1151 Navarro was transferred to the greater and richer diocese of Salamanca, closer to the centre of the kingdom, perhaps an indication of royal favour, to replace the deceased bishop Berengar. The period of the episcopates of Berengar and Navarro at Salamanca (c.1140 to c.1160) was characterised by economic growth in the town and its region, as well as the growth in population of Salamanca itself, although the bishops themselves remain generally obscure players in these events.For the economic growth of the region of Salamanca at this time, cf. Julio González, \\"Repoblación de la Extremadura leonesa,\\" Hispania, 3 (1943), 195–273. It was at that time the most successful of the areas of new settlement, and Navarro was praised by the king for his work in this regard. On 30 April 1154, Alfonso VII granted Navarro rights over those churches he had built near the new town of Castronuño.Fletcher, 167. The charter records that the bishop and his archdeacon, Ciprián, had given help (adiutorium) to the founder and namesake of the settlement, Nuño Pérez de Lara, and had outfitted the new churches with liturgical books and vestments.The extent of the project can be gauged somewhat from the fact that in 1177 the termino of Castronuño had twenty-two churches according to a bull of Pope Alexander III. By the time of Navarro's successor, Ordoño, the schools of Salamanca were attracting students from France, laying the groundwork for Spain's first university, the Universidad de Salamanca, a half century later.Fletcher, 40–41.

The term 'alcoholic lung disease' is not a generally accepted medical diagnosis, and \\"the association between alcohol abuse and acute lung injury remains largely unrecognized, even by lung researchers\\". Chronic alcohol ingestion impairs multiple critical cellular functions in the lung. These cellular impairments lead to increased susceptibility to the serious complications from a pre-existing lung disease. Recent research cites alcoholic lung disease as comparable to liver disease in alcohol-related mortality. Alcoholics have a higher risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and experience higher rates of mortality from ARDS when compared to non-alcoholics. Alcohol abuse can cause a susceptibility to infection after major trauma to the lungs / respiratory system. It creates an increased risk of aspiration of gastric acid, microbes from the upper part of the throat, decreased mucous-facilitated clearance of bacterial pathogens from the upper airway and impaired pulmonary host defenses. This increased colonization by pathogenic organisms, combined with the acute intoxicating effects of alcohol and the subsequent depression of the normally protective gag and cough reflexes, leads to more frequent and severe pneumonia from gram- negative organisms. Defects in the function of the upper airway's clearance mechanisms in alcoholic patients have been detected.  Cause Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lung parenchyma and oxygenation. When a patient with pneumonia is an alcoholic, the mortality rate exceeds by 50% if they are placed into intensive care (ICU). According to Kershaw, C 2008 page 1, \\"[a]s of 2001, pneumonia was the sixth most common cause of death in the United States\\". Alcoholics are at an increased risk for infection with tissue-damaging gram-negative pathogens or for the spread of bacteria in the blood. Mechanism The mechanisms of alcoholic lung disease are: * Metabolism of alcohol reduces glutathione anti-oxidant levels in the lungs. * Oxidation damage to the cells impairs the ability of the lungs to remove fluid. * Oxidative damage to cells reduces immune response. * Oxidative damage to cells results in a reduced ability to recover from injury. These chemical changes compound the negative mechanical and microbiological effects of alcoholism on the respiratory system. These include impaired gag reflex and cilia function and greater likelihood of colonies of pneumococcal bacteria in the upper respiratory system. Diagnosis=Differential diagnosis Although lung damage from concurrent smoking and drug use is often indistinguishable from alcoholic lung disease, there is support for considering alcoholic lung disease as an independent syndrome. Over the last decade, evidence from epistemological studies show that alcohol abuse alone can increase by as much as fourfold the risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome.

History =Background A reported total of four residences built for the country's rulers, whether the colonial governor general, king, emperor, or president, have occupied the site since the mid to late 18th century. At one point in the site's tumultuous history, when the chief of state was without an official home due to damage, a 19th-century French-style villa on Avenue Christophe assumed that role.John Dryden Kuser, Haiti: Its Dawn of Progress After Years In a Night of Revolution (Richard G. Badger/The Gorham Press, 1921), page 16 The earliest structure was the Government Palace (Palais du Gouvernement), which was constructed in the 18th century as the residence of the French governor general of Saint-Domingue. Its first Haitian inhabitant was the country's first president of Haiti, General Alexandre Pétion.The American Monthly Magazine and Critical Review, 1818, Volume 3, page 149David S.

A visitor in 1831 noted the building was \\"large and convenient, but not handsome. It is of one story, and situated in front of the parade, to the southeast of the town. Its entrance is up a fine flight of steps, leading through a spacious portico into the hall of audience. The floors of all the public rooms are of black and white marble. The furniture is tasteful and elegant, but not costly. This building ... was constructed with more attention to convenience than effect. The apartments are pleasantly cool.\\" In front of the palace stood the marble tomb of President Pétion and one of his daughters.\\"Recent communications from a Traveller in Hayti\\", The Friend, Volume 4 (The Friend., 1831), page 266\\"A handsome flight\\" cited in Charles Mackenzie, Notes on Haiti: made during a residence in that republic, Volume 1 (H.

On a richly carved table appeared a beautiful bronze clock, representing the arms of Haiti—namely, a palm-tree surrounded with fascines of pikes and surmounted with the Phrygian cap.

The palace's replacement, built in 1881, was seriously damaged on 8 August 1912 by a violent explosion that killed President Cincinnatus Leconte and several hundred of his soldiers almost a year to the day from Leconte's election. The National Geographic Magazine called the palace \\"a rather ugly structure of glistening gray white, with apparently a good deal of corrugated iron about it,\\" though adding that it \\"contained, however, some fine lofty rooms\\".

Baussan, architect of the present-day National Palace, as shown in 1920. The National Palace most recently occupying the site was designed in 1912 by (1874–1958), a leading Haitian architect who graduated from the Ecole d'Architecture in Paris and whose commissions included the City Hall of Port-au-Prince and Haiti's Supreme Court Building.Ruth Danenhower Wilson, Here is Haiti (Philosophical Library, 1957), page 47 He was a son of a former Haitian senator and the father of Robert Baussan, an architect who studied under Le Corbusier and later became the country's Undersecretary of State for Tourism.Craig Claiborne, \\"Haitian Hideaway\\", The New York Times, 19 June 1960The younger son of Georges H. Baussan, Robert Baussan (born 1908) also owned the luxury Ibo Lelé Hotel in Petion-Ville, a mountain suburb of Port-au-Prince; it had originally been designed as a villa for him and his family. Among his many projects was Cabane Chouchoune, a thatch-roof nightclub whose circular form and materials echoed African tribal architecture. His wife, Tamara Baussan (née Tamara Zekom, 1909–1999), was a Russian émigré who became a leading Haitian painter and sculptor. Their children, Jacques Baussan and Michèle Baussan Chassagne, managed another Baussan family property, Ibo Beach, a cottage colony on Cacique Island in Port-au-Prince harbor. Baussan's classical design was chosen from a range of plans submitted by Haitian and French architects in a national competition in 1912. His entry was awarded the second-place prize but also was selected to be the new National Palace, for financial reasons—the structure proposed by the first-place winner was deemed too costly.Bulletin of the Pan-American Union, Volume 37 (The Union, 1913), page 616 The construction budget for the new palace was set at $350,000 and work began in May 1914.Haïti, 1919–1920: Livre bleu d'Haïti (Compagnie biographique, 1920), pages 80–81Robert Debs Heinl and Nancy Gordon Heinl, Written in Blood: The Story of the Haitian People, 1492–1971 (Houghton Mifflin, 1978), page 371The builder assigned the task was Simmonds Frères. The government funded the construction of the building through a tax on \\"the exportation of cocoa and other products\\", according to \\"Haiti\\", The Bulletin of the Pan-American Union, 1914, Volume 43, page 163 By 1915, however, the under-construction palace was set ablaze by a mob that ousted and assassinated President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam. A contemporary news report stated the palace \\"has been partially destroyed after an early-morning attack which lasted several hours\\".\\"Haitian Massacre; President Flees; Zamor Executed\\", The New York Times, 28 July 1915 After President Sam's death, the country was occupied by the United States, with U.S. forces taking possession of the palace and U.S. naval engineers overseeing its completion.Haïti à la une: une anthologie a la presse haïtienne de 1724 à 1934, Volume 1 (1997), page 174Richard Eder, \\"Haiti: Land of the 'Big Tontons'\\", The New York Times, 24 January 1965\\"Americans Again Fire on Haitians\\", The New York Times, 7 August 1915 The building was finished in 1920.John Dryden Kuser, Haiti: Its Dawn of Progress After Years In a Night of Revolution (Richard G.

S. occupation. He visited Haiti in January 1920 and described the National Palace as \\"at a stage of near-completion, with one wing already occupied ...\\" Georges H. Baussan's 1912 design for the National Palace of Haiti. John Dryden Kuser, a wealthy American who visited Haiti in January 1920, described the new National Palace as \\"a huge structure, quite like a palace in appearance .... It is more than twice the size of our White House and is shaped like the letter E, with the three wings running back from the front. In the main hall huge columns rise to the ceiling and at each side a staircase winds up to the second floor\\". The primary rooms, Kuser noted, including the office of the president, were all about 40 feet square.John Dryden Kuser, Haiti: Its Dawn of Progress After Years In a Night of Revolution (Richard G. Badger/The Gorham Press, 1921), page 73-74 Like other public buildings in Haiti, Baussan's National Palace drew on the tradition of French Renaissance architecture and greatly resembled structures erected in France and its colonial territories during the late 19th century, such as the Saigon Governor's Palace, the residence of the French governor general of Cochinchina. Made of white-painted reinforced concrete, the two-story National Palace had a central section featuring a domed entrance pavilion whose four Ionic columns supported a pedimented portico; at either end of the main façade were matching domed pavilions, also groined.Edward E.

The collapsed cupola has become a symbol of the devastated quake-hit nation. The second floor of the building collapsed almost completely, taking the attic floor with it; the palace's columned central pavilion, a section containing the main hall and primary staircase, was entirely demolished. At the time of the earthquake, President René Préval and his wife, Elisabeth Delatour Préval, were at their private residence in another part of Port-au-Prince. France offered to rebuild the presidential palace, but in April 2010, the Haitian government announced plans to demolish the palace in preparation for reconstruction. Demolition and clearance of the site took place between September and December 2012.

Located in St. Clair Township west of the borough of New Florence, it was once occupied by a large Monongahela village during the pre-contact period. The village site lies on a bluff above the Conemaugh River northwest of Squirrel Hill, an imposing summit immediately southwest of New Florence, for which the site is named. The site has frequently been farmed since European settlement, and the disturbance resulting from plowing has brought up a large number of artifacts; consequently, locals have long been aware of the site's archaeological potential. A large area of permanently darkened soil suggests that the site was frequently the home of a dense population. Archaeological investigation has determined that the Squirrel Hill Site is the location of one of the largest Monongahela villages in the valley of the Ohio River. Like the similar Johnston Site to the northwest, it was likely composed of a group of circular houses around a central plaza and encircled by a stockade. Objects found at the site include flint tools, pieces of pottery, and a wide range of bone fragments. The presence of human burials is expected, as the Monongahela often buried their dead within their villages. Aside from plowing for agricultural purposes, the site has only rarely been disturbed; a dirt road crosses the property, but it is believed that the range of artifacts below the plow line has seen little damage. Few other Johnston phase Monongahela villages have been so well preserved as the Squirrel Hill Site. Accordingly, it has been seen as a prime potential site for yielding information about the poorly known late prehistoric Johnston phase. In 1980, the Squirrel Hill Site was added to the National Register of Historic Places because of its archaeological value. One acre of the site, including land on both sides of the small dirt road, was included in the area added to the Register.

Background Since his early political career, Abraham Lincoln supported the American Colonization Society, a group which spawned in the early 19th century to return former African slaves back to the continent of Africa. They helped to establish the colony of Liberia in 1821. Similarly to Linconia, the name of Liberia's capital Monrovia was derived from the name of the fifth President of the United States James Monroe. Lincoln desired to return former slaves to Africa or other tropical regions, with their consent and the accord of the authorities of the country where they were to be settled. He repeated his support for colonization numerous times, including during the American Civil War. The plan Chiriquí Province in Panama By 1862, Lincoln had decided that Chiriquí Province in Panama would be an ideal location to start an African colony. In August of that year, he invited a group of prominent Africans to the White House to discuss the plan. He stated that the area had \\"evidence of very rich coal mines...[and] among the finest [harbors] in the world.\\" The delegation reacted negatively to the plan. Later that month, The National Republican published an editorial with the title \\"The Colony of Linconia\\", which stated that \\"the necessary arrangements for founding a colony on a grand scale...have been completed\\" with the project being headed by Senator Pomeroy. Pomeroy proposed that 100 African-American families travel with him to the site as \\"pioneers\\" on October 1. In September, Pomeroy received the permission of the government of the Republic of New Granada, and landowner Ambrose W. Thompson of the Chiriquí Improvement Company. However, the Central American nations of Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Honduras felt threatened and informed Washington that they opposed this plan. United States Secretary of State William H. Seward informed these nations that no plan would continue without their consent, but Lincoln continued to push the plan forward. By late September, after being advised by Seward of the growing international outrage from the Central American nations, Lincoln decided to abandon the idea, angering Pomeroy who had already found 500 \\"pioneers.\\" See also *Île-à-Vache (the site of another Civil War–era colonization effort) References Category:Politically motivated migrations Category:Abraham Lincoln Category:Chiriquí Province Category:Settlement schemes Category:Proposed administrative territorial entities Category:Proposed states and territories of the United States Category:African-American history Category:Repatriated Africans Category:Colombia–United States relations Category:Panama–United States relations ","title":"Linconia"},{"id":"25789078","text":"The Bradano is a river in the Basilicata and Apulia regions of southern Italy.

He was the Haitian ambassador to the United States from 2005 to 2010, and he resigned to be considered for candidacy in the 2010 Haitian presidential election. He is founder of the largest Haitian newspaper Haïti Observateur, based out of Brooklyn, New York, that circulates not only for the Haitian diaspora but in Haiti as well. He infamously ran an informant operation of sources surrounding in and out of the presidential palace in Haiti during the Duvalier authoritarian years, that leaked information for him to report, all while avoiding an attempt on his life.  Early life and education  Joseph was born on August 31, 1931, in San Pedro de Macorís, Dominican Republic and lived in a batey (a sugar worker's town), whose family was originally from Les Cayes, Haiti. He is also a second cousin to the singer and rapper Wyclef Jean from his mother's side. Raymond Joseph spent his early years surrounded by Christian missionaries. At birth, Joseph was refused Dominican citizenship in several attempts. Following the genocide of over 10,000 Haitians at the border due to the Parsley Massacre imposed by dictator Rafael Trujillo, his father moved him and his brother back to Haiti, where Haitian citizenship was acquired. By age 10, in addition to Spanish, he was fluent in his native Haitian Creole, French, and English. In 1954, he volunteered as an interpreter for a Baptist preacher, who assisted Joseph in coming to the United States. Joseph enrolled in the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois, in 1954. Joseph remained in Chicago and later earned a BA in Anthropology from nearby Wheaton College. During his time in Chicago, Joseph became fluent in Hebrew and Greek. A devout Christian, after graduation he returned to Haiti and created the first translation of the New Testament and Psalms into Haitian Creole. In 1957, the dictator François \\"Papa Doc\\" Duvalier was elected President of Haiti, and Joseph became increasingly uncomfortable with the government. Joseph returned to the United States in 1961 and enrolled in the University of Chicago where he earned an MA in Social Anthropology in 1964.  Career  Joseph subsequently moved to New York and became a leader in the opposition movement against the Duvalier regime. Along with his brother, Joseph founded the Haïti Observateur in 1971, which became influential and widely circulated among the Haitian diaspora. Joseph subsequently worked as a reporter at the Wall Street Journal and a columnist at the New York Sun. Joseph turned his attention to the ongoing authoritative Duvalier regime in Haiti and built a network of informants inside the presidential palace of Port-au-Prince. He then would broadcast his intel from Brooklyn and in shortwaves in Haiti that became known Radio Vonvon, in which anti-communist associates from California and Ronald Reagan played a role in its formation. In an attempt to uncover the leaks inside of the palace, François Duvalier murdered 19 members of its guard and sent an assassin to New York to dispose of Joseph. However during a flight to New York, one of Joseph's sources was on the same plane and managed to tip him off. Expecting the assassin's arrival, he made a phone call to the would-be assassin, proposed a meeting and ended up having coffee together subsequentially avoiding assassination. When the regime of François Duvalier's son finally collapsed in 1986. In 1990, Joseph was appointed the Haitian Government's chargé d’affaires in Washington, DC, and the representative of the Haitian Government to the Organization of American States. In this role, Joseph organized election observers from the international community to participate in the Haitian Presidential Election. In 1991 Joseph returned to the Haïti Observateur where he remained until 2004, when he was again appointed Chargé d'Affaires in Washington, DC. In 2005 acting president Boniface Alexandre chose Joseph to be Haiti's ambassador to the United States. In the aftermath of the catastrophic January 12, 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Joseph played an active role in mobilizing the international community's response to Haiti. Joseph authored a book, For Whom the Dogs Spy, detailing the Duvalier regime right up until the 2010 Haiti earthquake.  Presidential candidate  On July 27, 2010, Joseph confirmed his intention to run for President of Haiti in the November 28, 2010 election. He resigned the ambassadorship on August 1, 2010 and moved to Port-au-Prince. Joseph was dismissed from the Haitian presidential race by Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council.

Wall painting from the catacombs, Rome, 4th century. Christianity in late antiquity traces Christianity during the Christian Roman Empire – the period from the rise of Christianity under Emperor Constantine (c. 313), until the fall of the Western Roman Empire (c. 476). The end-date of this period varies because the transition to the sub-Roman period occurred gradually and at different times in different areas. One may generally date late ancient Christianity as lasting to the late 6th century and the re- conquests under Justinian (reigned 527-565) of the Byzantine Empire, though a more traditional end-date is 476, the year in which Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustus, traditionally considered the last western emperor. Christianity began to spread initially from Roman Judaea without state support or endorsement. It became the state religion of Armenia in either 301 or 314, of Ethiopia in 325, and of Georgia in 337. With the Edict of Thessalonica it became the state religion of the Roman Empire in 380. Persecution and legalisation The Edict of Serdica was issued in 311 by the Roman emperor Galerius, officially ending the Diocletianic persecution of Christianity in the East.Lactantius, De Mortibus Persecutorum (\\"On the Deaths of the Persecutors\\") ch. 35–34 With the passage in 313 AD of the Edict of Milan, in which the Roman Emperors Constantine the Great and Licinius legalised the Christian religion, persecution of Christians by the Roman state ceased. The Emperor Constantine I was exposed to Christianity by his mother, Helena. There is scholarly controversy, however, as to whether Constantine adopted his mother's Christianity in his youth, or whether he adopted it gradually over the course of his life.R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, Medieval Worlds (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 55 Head of Constantine's colossal statue at Musei Capitolini In 313, he and Licinius issued the Edict of Milan, officially legalizing Christian worship. In 316, he acted as a judge in a North African dispute concerning the Donatist controversy. More significantly, in 325 he summoned the Council of Nicaea, effectively the first Ecumenical Council (unless the Council of Jerusalem is so classified), to deal mostly with the Arian controversy, but which also issued the Nicene Creed, which among other things professed a belief in One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church, the start of Christendom. The reign of Constantine established a precedent for the position of the Christian Emperor in the Church. Emperors considered themselves responsible to God for the spiritual health of their subjects, and thus they had a duty to maintain orthodoxy.Richards, Jeffrey. The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752 (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979) pp. 14–15 The emperor did not decide doctrine — that was the responsibility of the bishops — rather his role was to enforce doctrine, root out heresy, and uphold ecclesiastical unity.Richards, Jeffrey. The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752 (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979) p. 15 The emperor ensured that God was properly worshiped in his empire; what proper worship consisted of was the responsibility of the church. This precedent would continue until certain emperors of the fifth and six centuries sought to alter doctrine by imperial edict without recourse to councils, though even after this Constantine's precedent generally remained the norm.Richards, Jeffrey. The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752 (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979) p. 16 The reign of Constantine did not bring the total unity of Christianity within the Empire. His successor in the East, Constantius II, was an Arian who kept Arian bishops at his court and installed them in various sees, expelling the orthodox bishops. Constantius's successor, Julian, known in the Christian world as Julian the Apostate, was a philosopher who upon becoming emperor renounced Christianity and embraced a Neo-platonic and mystical form of paganism shocking the Christian establishment. Intent on re-establishing the prestige of the old pagan beliefs, he modified them to resemble Christian traditions such as the episcopal structure and public charity (hitherto unknown in Roman paganism). Julian eliminated most of the privileges and prestige previously afforded to the Christian Church. His reforms attempted to create a form of religious heterogeneity by, among other things, reopening pagan temples, accepting Christian bishops previously exiled as heretics, promoting Judaism, and returning Church lands to their original owners. However, Julian's short reign ended when he died while campaigning in the East. Christianity came to dominance during the reign of Julian's successors, Jovian, Valentinian I, and Valens (the last Eastern Arian Christian Emperor). State religion of Rome On February 27, 380, the Roman Empire officially adopted Trinitarian Nicene Christianity as its state religion. Prior to this date, Constantius II (337-361) and Valens (364-378) had personally favored Arian or Semi-Arianism forms of Christianity, but Valens' successor Theodosius I supported the Trinitarian doctrine as expounded in the Nicene Creed. On this date, Theodosuis I decreed that only the followers of Trinitarian Christianity were entitled to be referred to as Catholic Christians, while all others were to be considered to be practicers of heresy, which was to be considered illegal. In 385, this new legal authority of the Church resulted in the first case of many to come, of the capital punishment of a heretic, namely Priscillian. Review of Church policies towards heresy, including capital punishment (see Synod at Saragossa). In the several centuries of state sponsored Christianity that followed, pagans and heretical Christians were routinely persecuted by the Empire and the many kingdoms and countries that later occupied the place of the Empire,Ramsay MacMullen, Christianity and Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries, Yale University Press, September 23, 1997 but some Germanic tribes remained Arian well into the Middle Ages.\\"Christianity Missions and monasticism\\", Encyclopædia Britannica Online Theology and heresy=Heresies The earliest controversies were generally Christological in nature; that is, they were related to Jesus' (eternal) divinity or humanity. Docetism held that Jesus' humanity was merely an illusion, thus denying the incarnation. Arianism held that Jesus, while not merely mortal, was not eternally divine and was, therefore, of lesser status than God the Father (). Modalism (also called Sabellianism or Patripassianism) is the belief that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three different modes or aspects of God, as opposed to the Trinitarian view of three distinct persons or hypostases within the Godhead.G. T. Stokes, “Sabellianism,” ed. William Smith and Henry Wace, A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines (London: John Murray, 1877–1887), 567. Many groups held dualistic beliefs, maintaining that reality was composed into two radically opposing parts: matter, usually seen as evil, and spirit, seen as good. Others held that both the material and spiritual worlds were created by God and were therefore both good, and that this was represented in the unified divine and human natures of Christ.R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, Medieval Worlds (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 58 The development of doctrine, the position of orthodoxy, and the relationship between the various opinions is a matter of continuing academic debate. Since most Christians today subscribe to the doctrines established by the Nicene Creed, modern Christian theologians tend to regard the early debates as a unified orthodox position (see also Proto-orthodox Christianity and Palaeo-orthodoxy) against a minority of heretics. Other scholars, drawing upon, among other things, distinctions between Jewish Christians, Pauline Christians, and other groups such as Gnostics and Marcionites, argue that early Christianity was fragmented, with contemporaneous competing orthodoxies.e.g., ; ; Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers Later Church Fathers wrote volumes of theological texts, including Augustine, Gregory Nazianzus, Cyril of Jerusalem, Ambrose of Milan, Jerome, and others. What resulted was a golden age of literary and scholarly activity unmatched since the days of Virgil and Horace. Some of these fathers, such as John Chrysostom and Athanasius, suffered exile, persecution, or martyrdom from Arian Byzantine Emperors. Many of their writings are translated into English in the compilations of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers. Ecumenical councils the Emperor Constantine (center) and the bishops of the First Council of Nicaea (325) holding the Niceno–Constantinopolitan Creed of 381. During this era, several Ecumenical Councils were convened. * First Council of Nicaea (325) * First Council of Constantinople (381) * First Council of Ephesus (431) * Council of Chalcedon (451) These were mostly concerned with Christological disputes and represent an attempt to reach an orthodox consensus and to establish a unified Christian theology. The Council of Nicaea (325) condemned Arian teachings as heresy and produced a creed (see Nicene Creed). The Council of Ephesus condemned Nestorianism and affirmed the Blessed Virgin Mary to be Theotokos (\\"God-bearer\\" or \\"Mother of God\\"). The Council of Chalcedon asserted that Christ had two natures, fully God and fully man, distinct yet always in perfect union, largely affirming Leo's \\"Tome.\\" It overturned the result of the Second Council of Ephesus, condemned Monophysitism and influenced later condemnations of Monothelitism. None of the councils were universally accepted, and each major doctrinal decision resulted in a schism. The First Council of Ephesus caused the Nestorian Schism in 431 and separated the Church of the East, and the Council of Chalcedon caused the Chalcedonian Schism in 451, which separated Oriental Orthodoxy. =Council of Nicaea (325)= Emperor Constantine convened this council to settle a controversial issue, the relation between Jesus Christ and God the Father. The Emperor wanted to establish universal agreement on it. Representatives came from across the Empire, subsidized by the Emperor. Previous to this council, the bishops would hold local councils, such as the Council of Jerusalem, but there had been no universal, or ecumenical, council. The council drew up a creed, the original Nicene Creed, which received nearly unanimous support. The council's description of \\"God's only-begotten Son\\", Jesus Christ, as of the same substance with God the Father became a touchstone of Christian Trinitarianism. The council also addressed the issue of dating Easter (see Quartodecimanism and Easter controversy), recognised the right of the see of Alexandria to jurisdiction outside of its own province (by analogy with the jurisdiction exercised by Rome) and the prerogatives of the churches in Antioch and the other provincescanon 6 and approved the custom by which Jerusalem was honoured, but without the metropolitan dignity.canon 7 The Council was opposed by the Arians, and Constantine tried to reconcile Arius, after whom Arianism is named, with the Church. Even when Arius died in 336, one year before the death of Constantine, the controversy continued, with various separate groups espousing Arian sympathies in one way or another.\\"Arianism.\\" Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 In 359, a double council of Eastern and Western bishops affirmed a formula stating that the Father and the Son were similar in accord with the scriptures, the crowning victory for Arianism. The opponents of Arianism rallied, but in the First Council of Constantinople in 381 marked the final victory of Nicene orthodoxy within the Empire, though Arianism had by then spread to the Germanic tribes, among whom it gradually disappeared after the conversion of the Franks to Catholicism in 496. =Council of Constantinople (381)= Hagia Irene is a former church, now a museum, in Istanbul. Commissioned in the 4th century, it ranks as the first church built in Constantinople, and has its original atrium. In 381 the First Council of Constantinople took place in the church. Damaged by an earthquake in the 8th century, its present form largely dates from repairs made at that time. The council approved the current form of the Nicene Creed as used in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodox churches, but, except when Greek is used, with two additional Latin phrases (\\"Deum de Deo\\" and \\"Filioque\\") in the West. The form used by the Armenian Apostolic Church, which is part of Oriental Orthodoxy, has many more additions.Armenian Church Library: Nicene Creed This fuller creed may have existed before the Council and probably originated from the baptismal creed of Constantinople.\\"Nicene Creed.\\" Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 The council also condemned Apollinarism,\\"Constantinople, First Council of.\\" Cross, F. L., ed.

The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 It also granted Constantinople honorary precedence over all churches save Rome. The council did not include Western bishops or Roman legates, but it was accepted as ecumenical in the West. =Council of Ephesus (431)= Theodosius II called the council to settle the Nestorian controversy. Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople, opposed use of the term Theotokos (Greek Η Θεοτόκος, \\"God-bearer\\").\\"Nestorius.\\" Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 This term had long been used by orthodox writers, and it was gaining popularity along with devotion to Mary as Mother of God. He reportedly taught that there were two separate persons in the incarnate Christ, though whether he actually taught this is disputed. The council deposed Nestorius, repudiated Nestorianism as heretica, and proclaimed the Virgin Mary as the Theotokos. After quoting the Nicene Creed in its original form, as at the First Council of Nicaea, without the alterations and additions made at the First Council of Constantinople, it declared it \\"unlawful for any man to bring forward, or to write, or to compose a different (ἑτέραν) Faith as a rival to that established by the holy Fathers assembled with the Holy Ghost in Nicæa.\\"canon 7 The result of the Council led to political upheaval in the church, as the Assyrian Church of the East and the Persian Sasanian Empire supported Nestorius, resulting in the Nestorian Schism, which separated the Church of the East from the Latin Byzantine Church. =Council of Chalcedon (451)= Spectrum of Christological beliefs in late antiquity The council repudiated the Eutychian doctrine of monophysitism, described and delineated the \\"Hypostatic Union\\" and two natures of Christ, human and divine; adopted the Chalcedonian Creed. For those who accept it, it is the Fourth Ecumenical Council. It rejected the decision of the Second Council of Ephesus, referred to by the pope at the time as the \\"Robber Council\\". The Council of Chalcedon resulted in a schism, with the Oriental Orthodox Churches breaking communion with Chalcedonian Christianity. Biblical canon The Biblical canon—is the set of books Christians regard as divinely inspired and thus constituting the Christian Bible-- developed over time. While there was a good measure of debate in the Early Church over the New Testament canon, the major writings were accepted by almost all Christians by the middle of the 2nd century.The Cambridge History of the Bible (volume 1) eds. P. R. Ackroyd and C. F. Evans (Cambridge University Press, 1970) p. 308 Constantine commissions Bibles In 331, Constantine I commissioned Eusebius to deliver \\"Fifty Bibles\\" for the Church of Constantinople. Athanasius (Apol. Const. 4) recorded Alexandrian scribes around 340 preparing Bibles for Constans. Little else is known, though there is plenty of speculation. For example, it is speculated that this may have provided motivation for canon lists, and that Codex Vaticanus, Sinaiticus and Alexandrinus are examples of these Bibles. Together with the Peshitta, these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles.McDonald & Sanders, The Canon Debate, pages 414-415, for the entire paragraph Current canon In his Easter letter of 367, Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, gave a list of exactly the same books as what would become the New Testament canon, and he used the word \\"canonised\\" (kanonizomena) in regards to them.David Brakke, \\"Canon Formation and Social Conflict in Fourth Century Egypt: Athanasius of Alexandria's Thirty Ninth Festal Letter\\", in Harvard Theological Review 87 (1994) pp. 395–419 The African Synod of Hippo, in 393, approved the New Testament, as it stands today, together with the Septuagint books, a decision that was repeated by the Council of Carthage (397) and the Council of Carthage (419).McDonald & Sanders' The Canon Debate, 2002, Appendix D-2, note 19: \\"Revelation was added later in 419 at the subsequent synod of Carthage.\\" These councils were under the authority of St. Augustine, who regarded the canon as already closed.Everett Ferguson, \\"Factors leading to the Selection and Closure of the New Testament Canon\\", in The Canon Debate. eds. L. M. McDonald & J. A. Sanders (Hendrickson, 2002) p. 320; F. F. Bruce, The Canon of Scripture (Intervarsity Press, 1988) p. 230; cf. Augustine, De Civitate Dei 22.8 Pope Damasus I's Council of Rome in 382, if the Decretum Gelasianum is correctly associated with it, issued a biblical canon identical to that mentioned above, or if not the list is at least a sixth-century compilation.F. F. Bruce, The Canon of Scripture (Intervarsity Press, 1988) p. 234 Likewise, Damasus's commissioning of the Latin Vulgate edition of the Bible, c. 383, was instrumental in the fixation of the canon in the West.F. F. Bruce, The Canon of Scripture (Intervarsity Press, 1988) p. 225 In 405, Pope Innocent I sent a list of the sacred books to a Gallic bishop, Exsuperius of Toulouse. When these bishops and councils spoke on the matter, however, they were not defining something new, but instead \\"were ratifying what had already become the mind of the Church.\\"Everett Ferguson, \\"Factors leading to the Selection and Closure of the New Testament Canon\\", in The Canon Debate. eds. L. M. McDonald & J. A. Sanders (Hendrickson, 2002) p. 320; Bruce Metzger, The Canon of the New Testament: Its Origins, Development, and Significance (Oxford: Clarendon, 1987) pp. 237–238; F. F. Bruce, The Canon of Scripture (Intervarsity Press, 1988) p. 97 Thus, from the 4th century, there existed unanimity in the West concerning the New Testament canon (as it is today),F. F. Bruce, The Canon of Scripture (Intervarsity Press, 1988) p. 215 and by the fifth century the East, with a few exceptions, had come to accept the Book of Revelation and thus had come into harmony on the matter of the canon.The Cambridge History of the Bible (volume 1) eds. P. R. Ackroyd and C. F. Evans (Cambridge University Press, 1970) p. 305; cf. the Catholic Encyclopedia, Canon of the New Testament Nonetheless, a full dogmatic articulation of the canon was not made until the 16th century and 17th century.Council of Trent of 1546 for Roman Catholicism, the Thirty-Nine Articles of 1563 for the Church of England, the Westminster Confession of Faith of 1647 for Calvinism, and the Synod of Jerusalem of 1672 for the Eastern Orthodox. Church structure within the Empire=Dioceses After legalisation, the Church adopted the same organisational boundaries as the Empire: geographical provinces, called dioceses, corresponding to imperial governmental territorial division. The bishops, who were located in major urban centers by pre-legalisation tradition, thus oversaw each diocese. The bishop's location was his \\"seat\\", or \\"see\\"; among the sees, five held special eminence: Rome, Constantinople, Jerusalem, Antioch, and Alexandria. The prestige of these sees depended in part on their apostolic founders, from whom the bishops were therefore the spiritual successors, e.g., St. Mark as founder of the See of Alexandria, St. Peter of the See of Rome, etc. There were other significant elements: Jerusalem was the location of Christ's death and resurrection, the site of a 1st-century council, etc., see also Jerusalem in Christianity. Antioch was where Jesus' followers were first labelled as Christians, it was used in a derogatory way to berate the followers of Jesus the Christ. Rome was where SS. Peter and Paul had been martyred (killed), Constantinople was the \\"New Rome\\" where Constantine had moved his capital c. 330, and, lastly, all these cities had important relics. The Pentarchy By the 5th century, the ecclesiastical had evolved a hierarchical \\"pentarchy\\" or system of five sees (patriarchates), with a settled order of precedence, had been established. Rome, as the ancient capital and once largest city of the empire, was understandably given certain primacy within the pentarchy into which Christendom was now divided; though it was and still held that the patriarch of Rome was the first among equals. Constantinople was considered second in precedence as the new capital of the empire. Among these dioceses, the five with special eminence were Rome, Constantinople, Jerusalem, Antioch, and Alexandria. The prestige of most of these sees depended in part on their apostolic founders, from whom the bishops were therefore the spiritual successors. Though the patriarch of Rome was still held to be the first among equals, Constantinople was second in precedence as the new capital of the empire. Papacy and Primacy The Bishop of Rome and has the title of Pope and the office is the \\"papacy.\\" As a bishopric, its origin is consistent with the development of an episcopal structure in the 1st century. The papacy, however, also carries the notion of primacy: that the See of Rome is pre- eminent among all other sees. The origins of this concept are historically obscure; theologically, it is based on three ancient Christian traditions: (1) that the apostle Peter was pre-eminent among the apostles, see Primacy of Simon Peter, (2) that Peter ordained his successors for the Roman See, and (3) that the bishops are the successors of the apostles (apostolic succession). As long as the Papal See also happened to be the capital of the Western Empire, the prestige of the Bishop of Rome could be taken for granted without the need of sophisticated theological argumentation beyond these points; after its shift to Milan and then Ravenna, however, more detailed arguments were developed based on etc.cf. Richards, Jeffrey. The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752 (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979) p. 9 Nonetheless, in antiquity the Petrine and Apostolic quality, as well as a \\"primacy of respect\\", concerning the Roman See went unchallenged by emperors, eastern patriarchs, and the Eastern Church alike.Richards, Jeffrey. The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752 (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979) pp. 10 and 12 The Ecumenical Council of Constantinople in 381 affirmed the primacy of Rome.see J. D. Mansi, Sacrorum Conciliorum Nova et Amplissima Collectio 3, p. 559 Though the appellate jurisdiction of the Pope, and the position of Constantinople, would require further doctrinal clarification, by the close of Antiquity the primacy of Rome and the sophisticated theological arguments supporting it were fully developed. Just what exactly was entailed in this primacy, and its being exercised, would become a matter of controversy at certain later times. Outside the Roman Empire Christianity was by no means confined to the Roman Empire during late antiquity. Church of the East Historically, the most widespread Christian church in Asia was the Church of the East, the Christian church of Sasanian Persia. This church is often known as the Nestorian Church, due to its adoption of the doctrine of Nestorianism, which emphasized the disunity of the divine and human natures of Christ. It has also been known as the Persia Church, the East Syrian Church, the Assyrian Church, and, in China, as the \\"Luminous Religion\\". The Church of the East developed almost wholly apart from the Greek and Roman churches. In the 5th century it endorsed the doctrine of Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople from 428 to 431, especially following the Nestorian Schism after the condemnation of Nestorius for heresy at the First Council of Ephesus. For at least twelve hundred years the Church of the East was noted for its missionary zeal, its high degree of lay participation, its superior educational standards and cultural contributions in less developed countries, and its fortitude in the face of persecution. =Persian Empires= The Church of the East had its inception at a very early date in the buffer zone between the Roman Empire and the Parthian in Upper Mesopotamia. Edessa (now Şanlıurfa) in northwestern Mesopotamia was from apostolic times the principal center of Syriac-speaking Christianity. The missionary movement in the East began which gradually spread throughout Mesopotamia and Persia and by AD 280. When Constantine converted to Christianity the Persian Empire, suspecting a new \\"enemy within\\", became violently anti-Christian. The great persecution fell upon the Christians in Persia about the year 340. Though the religious motives were never unrelated, the primary cause of the persecution was political. Sometime before the death of Shapur II in 379, the intensity of the persecution slackened. Tradition calls it a forty-year persecution, lasting from 339-379 and ending only with Shapur's death. Caucasus Christianity became the official religion of Armenia in 301 or 314,Armenian History, Chapter III when Christianity was still illegal in the Roman Empire. Some claim the Armenian Apostolic Church was founded by Gregory the Illuminator of the late third – early fourth centuries while they trace their origins to the missions of Bartholomew the Apostle and Thaddeus (Jude the Apostle) in the 1st century. Christianity in Georgia (ancient Iberia) extends back to the 4th century, if not earlier.\\"Georgia, Church of.\\" Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 The Iberian king, Mirian III, converted to Christianity, probably in 326. Ethiopia According to the fourth-century Western historian Rufinius, it was Frumentius who brought Christianity to Ethiopia (the city of Axum) and served as its first bishop, probably shortly after 325.Catholic Encyclopedia: Ethiopia Germanic peoples Christian states in 495 AD The Germanic people underwent gradual Christianization from Late Antiquity. In the 4th century, the early process of Christianization of the various Germanic people was partly facilitated by the prestige of the Christian Roman Empire amongst European pagans. Until the decline of the Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes who had migrated there (with the exceptions of the Saxons, Franks, and Lombards, see below) had converted to Christianity.Padberg 1998, 26 Many of them, notably the Goths and Vandals, adopted Arianism instead of the Trinitarian (a.k.a. Nicene or orthodox) beliefs that were dogmatically defined by the Church Fathers in the Nicene Creed and Council of Chalcedon. The gradual rise of Germanic Christianity was, at times, voluntary, particularly amongst groups associated with the Roman Empire. From the 6th century AD, Germanic tribes were converted (and re-converted) by missionaries of the Catholic Church. Many Goths converted to Christianity as individuals outside the Roman Empire. Most members of other tribes converted to Christianity when their respective tribes settled within the Empire, and most Franks and Anglo- Saxons converted a few generations later. During the later centuries following the Fall of Rome, as schism between the dioceses loyal to the Pope of Rome in the West and those loyal to the other Patriarchs in the East, most of the Germanic peoples (excepting the Crimean Goths and a few other eastern groups) would gradually become strongly allied with the Catholic Church in the West, particularly as a result of the reign of Charlemagne. =Goths= In the 3rd century, East-Germanic peoples migrated into Scythia. Gothic culture and identity emerged from various East-Germanic, local, and Roman influences. In the same period, Gothic raiders took captives among the Romans, including many Christians, (and Roman-supported raiders took captives among the Goths). Wulfila or Ulfilas was the son or grandson of Christian captives from Sadagolthina in Cappadocia. In 337 or 341, Wulfila became the first bishop of the (Christian) Goths. By 348, one of the (Pagan) Gothic kings () began persecuting the Christian Goths, and Wulfila and many other Christian Goths fled to Moesia Secunda (in modern Bulgaria) in the Roman Empire.Philostorgius via Photius, Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius, book 2, chapter 5.Auxentius of Durostorum, Letter of Auxentius, quoted in Heather and Matthews, Goths in the Fourth Century, pp. 141-142. Other Christians, including Wereka, Batwin, and Saba, died in later persecutions. Between 348 and 383, Wulfila translated the Bible into the Gothic language.Auxentius of Durostorum, Letter of Auxentius, quoted in Heather and Matthews, Goths in the Fourth Century, p. 140. Thus some Arian Christians in the west used the vernacular languages, in this case including Gothic and Latin, for services, as did Christians in the eastern Roman provinces, while most Christians in the western provinces used Latin. =Franks & Alemanni= Roman Chi Rho applique in bronze found in a Germanic settlement in Neerharen (Belgium), 375-450 CE, Gallo-Roman Museum (Tongeren) The Franks and their ruling Merovingian dynasty, that had migrated to Gaul from the 3rd century had remained pagan at first. On Christmas 496,497 or 499 are also possible; Padberg 1998: 53 however, Clovis I following his victory at the Battle of Tolbiac converted to the orthodox faith of the Catholic Church and let himself be baptised at Rheims. The details of this event have been passed down by Gregory of Tours. Monasticism Monasticism is a form of asceticism whereby one renounces worldly pursuits () and concentrates solely on heavenly and spiritual pursuits, especially by the virtues humility, poverty, and chastity. It began early in the Church as a family of similar traditions, modeled upon Scriptural examples and ideals, and with roots in certain strands of Judaism. St. John the Baptist is seen as the archetypical monk, and monasticism was also inspired by the organisation of the Apostolic community as recorded in Acts of the Apostles. There are two forms of monasticism: eremetic and cenobitic. Eremetic monks, or hermits, live in solitude, whereas cenobitic monks live in communities, generally in a monastery, under a rule (or code of practice) and are governed by an abbot. Originally, all Christian monks were hermits, following the example of Anthony the Great. However, the need for some form of organised spiritual guidance lead Saint Pachomius in 318 to organise his many followers in what was to become the first monastery. Soon, similar institutions were established throughout the Egyptian desert as well as the rest of the eastern half of the Roman Empire. Central figures in the development of monasticism were, in the East, St. Basil the Great, and St. Benedict in the West, who created the famous Benedictine Rule, which would become the most common rule throughout the Middle Ages.

She lived there until 1974, when aged 23, she emigrated to Melbourne, Australia as part of an airlift of teachers. From 1977 to 1987, she worked as an editor on children's magazines Comet, Pursuit and Challenge.  Writing  Pershall is notable for her Two Weeks in Grade Six trilogy, which also includes the titles A Term in Year Seven and Escape from Year Eight. Her best known book is You Take the High Road, published in 1988, a novel for children set in contemporary Australia. It is listed in WorldCat as being held in 490 libraries. It has been translated into Dutch as Beelden van Nickie. Pershall is also responsible for the Ruby Clair series, which depicts a 12-year-old girl's struggle to juggle a normal life with the ghosts she can see, and has co-authored a number of novels with her daughters.

Her younger daughter, who had a long history of mental illness, anorexia, and substance abuse, gained national media attention in November 2015 as the woman who stabbed her 67-year-old roommate, Zvonimir “Johnnie” Petrovski, to death over a pack of cigarettes.

She is incarcerated in the Dame Phyllis Frost Women’s prison. The incident led Pershall to write her first non-fiction book, Gorgeous Girl, in 2018 where she \\"examines the complex mental and institutional issues that led to the ‘unimaginable horror’ of her child taking another’s life\\". Her older daughter has since gone on to a career in journalism.

Marcucci Productions. He discovered and managed the careers of Fabian and Frankie Avalon, among others. The 1980 movie, The Idolmaker, is loosely based on his life in the record industry. Early life and career Born and raised in Philadelphia, Bob Marcucci started in the music industry at age 25, as a songwriter, and subsequently borrowed $10,000 from his father to launch Chancellor Records. He signed Frankie Avalon as one of his first acts, but by the time Frankie had reached the age of 19, his appeal as a recording artist had begun to wane and Marcucci was in need of a new star. His next act was his neighbor's 14-year-old son. Marcucci's neighbor had suffered a heart attack, after which Marcucci went to help the family. He spotted the neighbor's young son and after the father had recovered, inquired as to whether the youngster would be interested in a career in music. Fabian initially declined but, because his family needed the money, eventually signed on as Marcucci's next act. After two years Fabian bought out his contract. Marcucci was the long-time manager of Hollywood gossip columnist Rona Barrett. He was co-producer of the 1984 version of The Razor's Edge, starring Bill Murray in a rare dramatic role. The following year, he produced A Letter to Three Wives for television. Later years In his later years, Marcucci continued to manage artists such as Danielle Brisebois, Amy Dolenz, Michael T. Weiss, Ron Moss and Cheryl Powers through his production companies. Marcucci died on March 9, 2011 at a hospital in Ontario, California, of respiratory complications and severe infections.

He was forced into exile in Jamaica after a 1908 revolt deposed Alexis and gave François C. Antoine Simon the presidency. Returning from exile in 1911, Leconte gathered a large military force. After leading the revolution that ousted President Simon and brought Leconte back to Port-au-Prince in triumph on August 7, 1911, Leconte was unanimously elected president of Haiti by Congress on August 14 with a seven-year term.Ferris, p. 623. His salary was set at $24,000 a year.Horace Greeley, The Tribune Almanac and Political Register (The Tribune Association, 1912), p. 502 Upon attaining the presidency he instituted a number of reforms: paving streets, increasing teacher pay, installing telephone lines, and decreasing the size of the army. Collier's Weekly argued in August 1912 that it was \\"generally admitted\\" that Leconte's administration was \\"the ablest and the cleanest government Haiti has had in forty years.\\" Zora Neale Hurston, writing in the 1930s after extensive research in Haiti, pointed out that Leconte was \\"credited with beginning numerous reforms and generally taking positive steps.\\" Leconte pursued a discriminatory policy toward the local Syrian population (Christian migrants from Ottoman Syria), an already persecuted minority group which one historian described as constituting the \\"opening wedge of the American economic conquest of Haiti in the early 1900s.\\"In 1905 the Syrian population of Haiti was estimated to be 15,000. Prior to ascending to the presidency, he had promised to rid Haiti of its Syrian population. In 1912 Leconte's foreign minister released a statement stating that it was \\"necessary to protect nationals against the disloyal competition of the Easterner whose nationality is uncertain.\\"Charles Arthur and J. Michael Dash, A Haiti Anthology: Libète (Markus Wiener Publishers, 1999), p. 219Caribbean Societies, Volume 2 (University of London, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, 1985), p. 115 A 1903 law (aimed specifically at Syrians) limiting the immigration levels and commercial activities of foreigners was revived, and the harassment of Syrians that had been prevalent in the first few years of the 1900s was resumed. The Leconte administration did, however, continue to process claims made by Syrians who had been persecuted by the government of Nord Alexis.Plummer, pp. 522–23, 533. When Leconte died suddenly in 1912, a number of Syrians celebrated his passing and were imprisoned as a result, while others were deported. His Syrian policy would be continued by his successor Tancrède Auguste.Plummer, p. 536. Death Despite being elected to a seven-year term, Leconte's time in office was short lived. On August 8, 1912, a violent explosion destroyed the National Palace, killing the president and several hundred soldiers. An Associated Press report at the time noted: > So great was the force of the explosion, that a number of small cannon, > fragments of iron and shell were thrown long distances in all directions, > and many of the palace attendants were killed. Every house in the city was > shaken violently and the entire population, greatly alarmed, rushed into the > street. A 1912 account of the explosion in Political Science Quarterly reported that an \\"accidental ignition of ammunition stores caused the death of General Cincinnatus Leconte,\\" while a 1927 article in the same journal deemed his death an \\"assassination.\\" Oral histories circulating in Haiti—some of which were chronicled by Hurston in the 1930s in her book Tell My Horse: Voodoo and Life in Haiti and Jamaica—differed significantly from most written accounts. As Hurston explained, \\"The history books all say Cincinnatus Leconte died in the explosion that destroyed the palace, but the people do not tell it that way. Not one person, high or low, ever told me that Leconte was killed by the explosion. It is generally accepted that the destruction of the palace was to cover up the fact that the President was already dead by violence.\\" According to Hurston there were \\"many reasons given for the alleged assassination\\", but the main actors in the supposed plot were men who \\"were ambitious and stood to gain political power...by the death of President Leconte.\\"Hurston, p. 103. Just several months before Leconte died, his nephew, Joseph Philippe Lemercier Laroche, had been one of over 2,200 passengers and crew on board the RMS Titanic for its maiden voyage. While Laroche's wife and daughters survived the sinking of the ocean liner, Laroche himself, the only man of African descent on board the ship, perished in the disaster.

It is updated daily with stories from the Associated Press that are chosen based on relevancy to pre-adolescents. Tweens can post comments to the stories which are moderated by their teachers, and teachers can use the site as a resource for meeting No Child Left Behind requirements for reading, writing and computer skills. The site first appeared on Nov 21, 2008.

Financial model TweenTribune.com is a proof-of-concept model for new ways to fund journalism online. The site employs a series of previously untried methods for building audience and revenue. These strategies grew audience and revenue in a matter of weeks, but it remains too soon to tell whether these strategies are the \\"silver bullet\\" that media companies seek to funding journalismAre tweens the solution to the newspaper crisis? by Brian Reich of Wemedia.com in the digital age. Quoted on Dec. 15, 2009, James Rainey of the Los Angeles Times said founder Alan Jacobson's \\"ebullient innovationNewspaper epitaph: ‘Who else is doing it?’ by Alan Mutter, former editor at the San Francisco Chronicle, media consultant and instructor at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California- Berkeley opens a door for an underserved audience and provides the kind of incremental revenue that, strand by strand, eventually just might rope journalism back to a financial mooring.\\"News website pins its hopes on tweens by James Rainey of the Los Angeles Times Business model To achieve sustainability, the site uses a group of strategies to reduce cost: 1\\\\. As of January 2010, all content is provided by outside sources. Stories come from the Associated Press, while comments are generated by children in the form of user-generated content (UGC). 2\\\\. Editing of comments is provided by teachers, so editing is distributed among users as a means of reducing cost rather than centralizing editing with a paid staff. This is an example of distributive editing (DE). 3\\\\. Primary source code is provided by Drupal, a free, open-source code content management system. The site also depends upon other open-source applications, such as Linux, Apache, PHP and MySQL. 4\\\\. All custom source code was written by Ebizon Netinfo of Noida, India which was more economical than developing the code in the US. Revenue streams Four diversified revenue streams form a previously untested business model for online news: 1\\\\. Local and national advertising is targeted demographically, based on the appeal of the content to a youth audience, and geographically, with specific local ads served up based on the IP address of the user. The user's location determines which ads they see. 2\\\\. Sponsorships by national advertisers are targeted demographically, based on the appeal of the adjacent news content. Sponsorships can also be targeted topically, on such subjects as Animals, Technology, Fashion, etc. 3\\\\. License fees are paid by local media companies for permission to post their local content as a means of promoting their local brands and creating the next generation of news consumers. In addition, local media companies can sell advertising which is targeted geographically. Newspapers using this model include The Valdosta Daily Times, The Traverse City Record-Eagle and the Brainerd Dispatch. Other newspapers using TweenTribune include the Bakersfield Californian, The Virginian-Pilot and the Free Lance-Star in Fredericksburg, VA. 4.\\"Freemium\\" model, in which basic features are provided to teachers and students at no cost, with specific value-added features that are provided at an additional, nominal cost.Chris Anderson's Free: The Future of a Radical Price published July 7, 2009 History Alan Jacobson,Jacobson's bio on BrassTacksDesign.com president of BrassTacksDesign, created TweenTribune as a way of helping his 10-year-old daughter with her homework. Launched on Nov 21, 2008, the site showed little traffic in its first year of existence. But in October 2009 page views began to jump dramatically after a new promotional campaign was launched that marketed the site directly to teachers — a strategy that hadn't been tried before. Based on traffic recorded in May 2010, the site now has 3.4 million page views per month, and 26,000 teachers are registered. TweenTribune is used in 50,000 classrooms in the U.S., Australia, Canada and Japan.

Life and career Stromberg was born in Los Angeles, California, on May 16, 1923, the son of legendary Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and independent producer Hunt Stromberg. He began his career as a producer with the successful revival of Victor Herbert's The Red Mill in 1945 - which, at age 23, made him the youngest producer on Broadway. He followed-up with revivals of The Front Page in 1946 and Sally in 1948. In the early 1950s Stromberg was program director for KABC-TV, a Los Angeles ABC-TV affiliate, and was looking for a host for a late-night horror movie program. He remembered seeing a beautiful, wasp-waisted woman win first prize at a masquerade ball dressed as a ghoul. After months of searching he tracked down actress/model Maila Nurmi and in 1954 they created Vampira. An overnight, nationwide success, the oft-copied character was to remain popular for decades. By the late 1950s Stromberg was a protégé of James Aubrey and followed him to CBS when he became top programming executive there, involved with such shows as The Beverly Hillbillies, Hogan's Heroes, Gilligan's Island, Green Acres, and Lost in Space. Due to corporate in-fighting, he brought about the cancellation of The Judy Garland Show, and together with Aubrey was ousted from CBS in 1965.Rainbow's End: The Judy Garland Show by Coyne Steven Sanders, copyright 1990, paperback edition 1992, Zebra Books . As an independent TV producer Stromberg turned to the horror genre and produced Frankenstein: The True Story in 1973, which is \\"Considered by many to be the finest film version of this classic tale.\\" Following that project, he began work on a made-for-TV film adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, which was never completed. (His father had produced the 1940 MGM adaptation of the novel, starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson.) In 1980 he executive produced The Curse of King Tut's Tomb and at the time of his death held the movie option for Robert Bloch's book Night of the Ripper. Hunt Stromberg Jr. was married to Marilyn Elwell from 1947 to 1949. He died on November 24, 1986, in Los Angeles, California - where he was born - of a ruptured aneurysm.

During the 19th century he rose to become the wealthiest person in St. Louis, Missouri. The cities of O'Fallon, Illinois and O'Fallon, Missouri are named after him. In 1857, he donated over $1 million to establish the O'Fallon Institute at what is now Washington University in St. Louis.Edited Appletons Encyclopedia, Copyright © 2001 O'Fallon's father, James O'Fallon, was a physician who served as a surgeon in Washington's army during the Revolutionary War. After the war, he went to Louisville, Kentucky, married Frances Clark, a sister of George Rogers Clark and William Clark, Army officers, who became famous in exploring the Mississippi Valley. In 1793, when O'Fallon was two and his brother Benjamin was an infant, his father died. According to one source, the boys were sent to St. Louis and raised by their mother's brother, William Clark.Delo, David M. Peddlers and Post Traders: The Army Suttler on the Frontier. Helena, MT: Kingfisher Books, 1998. p. 35; Delo cites Richard Edwards and M. Hopewell, M.D. Edward's Great West and Her Commercial Metropolis and a History of St. Louis (St. Louis: Edward's Monthly, 1860), 79-80 Another source says he was raised by his mother. Given the ages of John and Benjamin at the time, it seems possible that when their father died, William Clark offered his sister and her two infant children a permanent home with him in St. Louis. In 1810, John graduated from college in Lexington, Kentucky.Delo, David M. Peddlers and Post Traders: The Army Suttler on the Frontier. Helena, MT: Kingfisher Books, 1998. p. 35 Following in his father's footsteps, and at the urging of his friends and, probably, of a close family friend, Major Croghan, he entered the army early in the War of 1812. He was assigned to General Harrison's army at Vincennes, Indiana. Promoted to Captain of the Second U.S. Rifle Regiment by March 1814, by May 1815 he commanded this unit.Delo, Peddlers and Post Traders, p. 36 When the war ended, Congress downsized the army. O'Fallon was one of only four captains it chose to retain. However, on 31 July 1818, he resigned his commission, returned to St. Louis, and secured a post as sutler to the Yellowstone Expedition.Delo, Peddlers and Post Traders, pp. 36-37 The sluggish expedition never reached its destination. When it took two years to even reach Fort Lisa (near present-day Council Bluffs, Iowa), Congress cut its funding.Delo, Peddlers and Post Traders, p. 39 O'Fallon continued as an army sutler in the Council Bluffs area. He freighted his supplies up the Mississippi river in his own boat or boats.Delo, Peddlers and Post Traders, p. 37 In 1820, one of them sank, fully loaded, and nearly wiped him out. St. Louis financial institutions had been hard-hit by the Panic of 1819 and credit was tight, further adding to his financial woes. O'Fallon eventually decided that for him, the risks weren't worth the potential profit. In 1823, he turned his sutler's business over to a close friend (James Kennerly) and began farming and making whiskey with his half-brother in Louisville, Kentucky. The whiskey-making, apparently, turned a big profit.Delo, Peddlers and Post Traders, pp. 40-42 His whiskey trade apparently didn't hurt his reputation; in 1822 St. Louis elected him Representative to the first Missouri State Legislature, and re-elected him in 1824.\\"Missouri Government: Archives: History: Missouri State Legislators, 1820-2000\\", accessed 2/27/2017 Through subsequent investment, speculation, and inheritance he became one of the leading businessmen of St. Louis. He was president of a branch bank of the U.S. Bank, and \\"was on the board of half the businesses in St. Louis.\\"Delo, Peddlers and Post Traders, p. 43 He was especially active in railroad-building. O'Fallon presided over the 1849 committee which formed the Pacific Railroad (now Missouri Pacific Railroad); was the first president of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad (now Baltimore and Ohio Railroad) and in 1850 became president of and the North Missouri Railroad (now the Wabash Railroad). In later life, O'Fallon seems to have used a significant amount of his wealth and prestige for the benefit others. He donated land for Saint Louis University, Washington University in St. Louis (two blocks), O'Fallon Park, and a water works. He also financially supported Washington University's medical college and founded O'Fallon Polytechnic Institute.\\"Motor Racing Patron St. Louis Family Dies,\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 15 Jan 1941, p. 21 A one-time slaveowner, O'Fallon, to his credit, also seems to have changed his views on slavery, as in 1846 he was elected president of a hundred-member abolitionist committee.

She was decommissioned on 11 March 1947 and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Recommissioned on 22 September 1950 and served during the Korean War between 1951 and 1953. She was decommissioned on 5 July 1955 and laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. The ship was purchased by the Australian Army on 26 January 1960 and was named Clive Steele (AV 1356) in honour of the Australian World War II general Clive Steele. The ship was one of four LSMs operated by the newly formed 32nd Small Ship Squadron, Royal Australian Engineers. From 1960 to 1970 she performed routine duties in support of the Australian Army, and carried equipment between ports in Australia, New Guinea, Malaysia and New Zealand. The ship was deployed to Vung Tau in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War where she operated in South Vietnamese waters. Clive Steele was decommissioned on 30 September 1971 when the 32nd Small Ship Squadron was disbanded. She was sold to Pacific Logistics. Service=US Navy Clive Steele was laid down at Brown Shipbuilding Company, in Houston, Texas, and commissioned into the United States Navy (USN) as USS LSM-547 on 25 January 1946. She was decommissioned on 11 March 1947 and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was then re-commissioned on 22 September 1950 and served during the Korean War between 1951 and 1953. She was decommissioned again on 5 July 1955 and laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Australian Army In 1959, the Australian Army purchased four Landing Ship Medium (LSM) from the US Navy in Japan. These vessels were veterans of the Pacific Campaigns in World War II and the Korean War. They served extensively with 32 Small Ship Squadron in New Guinea and the South West Pacific and two of them served in Borneo during the confrontation with Indonesia in 1964. 32 Small Ship Squadron was disbanded in early 1972, after which the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) became responsible for all seagoing activities of the Defence Force. She was one of the four Australian Army LSMs to serve in Vietnam. The Australian Army held one LSM vessel on station in Vietnam during the Australian involvement in support of both Australian and US forces operating mainly between Saigon, Vung Tau and Cam Ranh Bay. They also visited the coastal ports of Nha Trang, Phan Rang, Qui Nhon and Da Nang plus the Mekong Delta ports of My Tho, Can Tho and Bin Thuy. They were mainly on station to support Australian ground troops around Bien Hoa, Nui Dat and Vung Tau, but when not required they were used to support US Army units between the Mekong Delta and Danang. All LSM ships served in Vietnam with the John Monash undertaking the \\"shuttle run\\" between Australia and Vietnam. Design=Crew Each LSM carried a crew of 4 Officers and 47 other ranks, when on operations in Vietnam. While most of the manning was RAE, members of other Corps were also part of each crew, including medical, signals and ordnance. In Vietnam, the ships were fitted with a 40mm gun and several machine guns for protection. Signallers who served with the 32 Small Ship Squadron all became experienced ship Radio Operators who adapted to ships life, working both with the RAN and Army units in Vietnamese waters, without much support from RASigs. 32 Small Ship Squadron Headquarters (HQ) never left Australia and was located in Sydney. Once the ships sailed from their Sydney Base, operational control was RAN via the Commander Australian Fleet (COMAUSTFLT). In Vietnam waters the tasking was HQ Australian Vietnam Force (AFV) via HQ 1st Australian Logistics Support Group (1ALSG). Ship conditions The LSMs were built for short- term use landing supplies in the Pacific during World War II. As such the facilities for the crew were extremely basic. All accommodation spaces were below deck with poor ventilation with several sections of three tiered bunks in cramped and crowded conditions giving no room to roll over. Above the bunks were pipes lagged with asbestos, which would rain down on the sleeper during heavy seas, covering him in white dust. Toilet facilities were an open tray with a row of seats and no privacy. The Forrard Mess was the eating, meeting and relaxing place in each LSM. The flat-bottomed ships did not travel well in rough seas. When committed to the Vietnam War, the LSMs were already old ships in need of constant maintenance. On the Clive Steeles final voyage to Vietnam in 1970 one of the bow doors fell off whilst in transit. The LSM ships had to return to Sydney for repairs before taking up station in Vietnam. Fate Clive Steele was decommissioned by the Australian Army in 1972 and sold to the Pacific Logistics S.A., Philippines. On 6 July 1973, she was struck by Communist rockets in the Mekong Delta where she was beached and abandoned. Her final resting place is unknown. USS LSM-547 Clive Steele earned four battle stars for her service in the Korean War alone. Clive Steele was also the only Australian LSM to sustain battle damage during the Vietnam War. Attacked in the Mekong Delta while sailing between Can Tho and Vung Tau on 5 January 1969, the ship was hit by three B40 RPG rockets. The water distilling plant and the refrigeration system were damaged, but there were no casualties amongst the crew.

Plot The series is set in the fictional Kingdom of Dholakpur, somewhere in rural India. The series revolves around Bheem, sometimes referred to as Chhota Bheem (little Bheem) due to his young age, a boy who is brave, strong and intelligent. Bheem's rival is Kalia, who is envious of Bheem's popularity. Kalia, along with his sidekicks, twin brothers Dholu and Bholu, always plot to embarrass and defeat Bheem, but never succeed. Most of the initial stories revolved around Bheem and his friends Chutki, Raju and Jaggu's rivalry with Kalia and his friends Dholu and bholu. However, as the series has progressed, this topic has been adopted as the subject less often, although Kalia is still just as eager to prove himself superior to Bheem. A large number of episodes along with all the films also focus on Bheem and his team solving various problems affecting the village, unravelling mysteries, fighting evils that seek to harm Dholakpur or its inhabitants, and on their antics which often get them into trouble. During Bheem's early days, the broadcaster Pogo had stressed that storyline be kept simple and mysteries and complex plot avoided at all cost, as the viewers were too young to understand, but nowadays there is no such restriction. The timeline and Dholakpur too have been allowed to become fluid and stretchable and this has caused the characters to become more person-like and less childish. Supernatural events have often been used in episodes, like Dholakpur being attacked by the demon Kirmada, the evil witch, or giants, Bheem and his friends being affected by dark magic and curses, and so on.

He established his animation studio Green Gold Animation in 2001. He had to struggle as no TV channel was ready to pick up the Indian animation content and most Indian contents aired were mythological in nature. His company produced Vikram Betal and Krishna animation shows which convinced Pogo TV to give chance. After the five years of conception, Chhota Bheem made his first appearance in 2008 on Pogo TV. It succeeded and continued to run. He is financed by Samir Jain, who belongs to the famous Jain-cum-Agarwal business family from Meerut. Raj Viswanadha, who did the writing for the first four years of Bheem before leaving the series, Arun Shendurnikar, Nidhi Anand are prominent among those who have written the stories for the show. Influences Rajiv Chilaka had conceived an adventurous young boy with the strength and attributes of Bhima from Mahabharata, living in an unspecified period in medieval India.

The city had been a magnet for artists wishing to study its classical ruins since the early 1400s. A revived interest in the Classics brought about the first archaeological study of Roman remains by the architect Filippo Brunelleschi and sculptor Donatello. This inspired a corresponding classicism in painting and sculpture, which manifested itself in the paintings of Masaccio and Uccello. Pisanello and his assistants also frequently took inspiration from ancient remains, but their approach was essentially cataloguing, acquiring a repertoire of models to be exploited later.De Vecchi-Cerchiari, cit., p. 13. In the year 1420, Pope Martin V moved the papal seat back to Rome, following its long \\"Babylonian captivity\\", and after the Papal Schism, when several \\"popes\\" simultaneously claimed the office. He at once set to work, establishing order and restoring the dilapidated churches, palaces, bridges, and other public structures. For this reconstruction he engaged some famous masters of the Tuscan school, and thus laid the foundation for the Roman Renaissance.Zuffi, cit., P.. 200. Historical background The 14th century in Rome, with the absence of the popes during the Avignon Papacy, was a century of neglect and misery. Rome dropped to its lowest level of population, and those that remained were starving and wretched. Before the return of the papacy, repeatedly postponed because of the bad conditions of the city and the lack of control and security, it was first necessary to strengthen the political and doctrinal aspects of the pontiff. When, in 1377, Gregory XI did return to Rome, he found his power more formal than real. It was a city in anarchy because of the struggles between the nobility and the popular faction. There followed four decades of instability, characterized locally by power struggles between the commune and the papacy, and internationally by the great Western Schism. It was finally Martin V of the Colonna family who managed to bring order to the city, laying the foundations of its rebirth.Ludovico Gatto, History of Rome in the Middle Ages, Rome, Newton & Compton, 1999.  Martin V (1417–1431)  The head of a princess attributed in a cycle of Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran of Pisanello e Gentile, Museo di palazzo Venezia, Rome. Pope Martin V was born at Genazzano in 1368. He studied at the University of Perugia, became prothonotary Apostolic under Pope Urban VI, and papal auditor and nuncio at various Italian courts under Pope Boniface IX. On 12 June 1402 he was made Cardinal Deacon of San Giorgio in Velabro. At the Council of Constance he was unanimously elected pope on 11 November 1417, and took the name Martin V in honour of Martin of Tours, whose feast fell on the day of his election. King Sigismund of Germany tried to induce Martin V to stay in Germany while France begged him to come to Avignon, but, rejecting all offers, he set out for Rome on 16 May 1418. After many detours, primarily to cement relations with the Queen of Naples, Bracco di Montone, and others, he arrived on 28 September 1420. The first work began on the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, which has been badly damaged in 1413. In 1421 the church was enriched by a new Cosmatesque floor and the ceiling was repaired, while Gentile da Fabriano received a commission to create a new cycle of frescoes in the right aisle. These were completed by Pisanello after his death in 1427. The basilica also received a new monastery, assigned to the Benedictines. The pavement of the basilica and the columns were designed as signature pieces of the Colonna family. When Cosimo de' Medici was exiled from Florence, Donatello returned to Rome, remaining until 1433. The two works that testify to his presence in this city, the Tomb of Giovanni Crivelli at Santa Maria in Aracoeli, and the ciborium at St. Peter's Basilica, bear a strong stamp of classical influence. Brunelleschi also returned several times to find inspiration for what was the Renaissance art.Elena Capretti, Brunelleschi, Giunti Editore, Florence 2003, p. 22–23. While in Florence, Masaccio, first great Italian painter of the Quattrocento, became friends with Brunelleschi and Donatello, and at their prompting in 1423 travelled to Rome, along with his mentor Masolino. From that point he was freed of all Gothic and Byzantine influence, as may be seen in his altarpiece for the Carmelite Church in Pisa. The traces of influences from ancient Roman and Greek art that are present in some of Masaccio's works must also have originated from this trip. Unfortunately, any further innovation was curtailed by Masaccio's premature death at the age of 27.John T. Spike, Masaccio, illustrated books Rizzoli, Milano 2002  Eugene IV (1431–1447)  Eugenius IV (Gabriello Condulmaro, or Condulmerio) was born in Venice in 1388, of a wealthy family. He was nephew to Pope Gregory XII. His service to Pope Martin V was such that he was elected to the papacy on the first scrutiny. However, his papacy was destined to be a stormy one. In 1434, a revolution, fomented by the pope's enemies, broke out in Rome. Eugene escaped down the Tiber to Ostia, where the friendly Florentines were only too happy to receive him. He took up his residence in the Dominican convent of Santa Maria Novella, and sent Vitelleschi, the militant Bishop of Recanati, to restore order in the Papal States. Florence at that time was the centre of literary activity, and clearly influenced the Humanist movement. During his stay in the Tuscan capital, Eugene consecrated the Florence Cathedral, just then finished by Brunelleschi. Filarete bronze door for the Old St. Peter's Basilica in Rome Pope Eugene IV continued in this vein in Rome, commissioning the Florentine Antonio di Pietro Averlino, known as Filarete (1400–1469), to make two bronze doors, (imposts), for the Old St. Peter's Basilica, completed in 1445. The six panels show Jesus the Savior and Mary enthroned, St. Paul with the sword, and St. Peter, who is giving the keys to the kneeling Pope Eugene IV. The two lowest panels show St. Paul sentenced by Nero, and the martyrdom of St. Paul. The bas-reliefs between the framed panels show scenes from the pontificate of Eugene IV, and representatives at the Council of Ferrara-Florence, summoned in 1438 to reunite the Churches of the East and of the West.De Vecchi-Cerchiari, cit., p. 64. In 1443–1445, Leon Battista Alberti, whose many talents truly epitomised the \\"Renaissance Man\\", wrote the Descriptio urbis Romae, where he proposed a system for a geometric arrangement of the city centred on the Capitoline Hill. He later became the architectural advisor to Pope Nicholas V and was involved in a number of projects at the Vatican. Shortly after they arrived in town, Beato Angelico and French Jean Fouquet began a series of frescoes in the Old St. Peter's Basilica, which testifies to the presence of the nascent interest in Flemish painting and the Nordic generally.De Vecchi- Cerchiari, cit., p. 67. Although the duration of the pontificate of Eugene IV did not allow for the full implementation of his plans, Rome became a fruitful meeting ground for artists of different schools. This would soon spawn a common style, which for the first time be defined as \\"Roman\\". Nicholas V (1447–1455) The collaboration between Alberti and Pope Nicholas V gave rise to the first grandiose building projects of Renaissance Rome. The plan for the city focused primarily on five main points:De Vecchi-Cerchiari, cit., p. 76. * restore the walls * restoration or reconstruction of the forty churches in the city * reset the Borgo district * expansion of the Old St. Peter's Basilica * restoration of the Apostolic Palace The intent was to gain a citadel of religion that had its focal point on the Capitoline Hill. The project's aim was to exalt the power of the Church, clearly demonstrating the continuity between the Imperial and Christian Rome. It was to Nicholas V that Alberti dedicated in 1452 the monumental theoretical result of his long study of Vitruvius. This was his De re aedificatoria (On the Art of Building), not a restored text of Vitruvius but a wholly new work. It became a bible of Renaissance architecture, for it incorporated and made advances upon the engineering knowledge of antiquity, and grounded the stylistic principles of classical art into a fully developed aesthetic theory. Due to the brevity of the pontificate of Pope Nicholas V, all the ambitious projects could not be completed. However, it made artists who shared an interest in the antiquity and charm of the classic ruins converge (especially the Tuscan and Lombard ones). This led to a certain homogeneity of their work. Palazzo Venezia, the courtyard of the Palazzetto A paradigmatic example of the style that developed in that period in architecture is Palazzo Venezia, started in 1455, that incorporating existing buildings. The courtyard of the annexed Palazzetto is taken from Roman elements combined, but without philological rigor. It incorporates the model of the viridarium and is inspired by the Colosseum in the overlapped architectural orders, and in the cornice with ornament in brackets. The width of the arches, however, is reduced and simplified so they will not look too impressive compared to the spaces they enclose. In the building itself (built from 1466), there was a more faithful revival of ancient models, which shows a gradually deeper understanding. For example, the hall was once a lacunar in concrete (taken from Pantheon or the Basilica of Maxentius) with overlapping orders and partially leaning on the pillars, as in the Colosseum or in the Theatre of Marcellus. The renewal of the Constantinian Old St. Peter's Basilica was assigned to Bernardo Rossellino. The body was expanded with five aisles and longitudinal cross vaults on pillars that were to incorporate the old columns. The apse was rebuilt with the expansion of the transept, a choir was added, which was the logical continuation of the nave, and also a domed room at the intersection of the transept and choir. This configuration influenced the next plan by Bramante for a total overhaul of the building, which retained what was already built.Christof Thoenes,San Pietro, and fortune of a model in the 16th century Barnabiti studies, n. 19, 2002. Work began around 1450, but with the death of the Pope had no further development, and stagnated until Julius II decided for a complete reconstruction.Gianfranco Spagnesi, Rome: the Basilica of St. Peter, the village and the city, 2003, pp. 53–54. The renewal of the Apostolic Palace was a first step in the decoration of the private chapel of the Pope, the Niccoline Chapel, by Fra Angelico and his assistant Benozzo Gozzoli. The decoration includes stories of St. Lawrence and St. Stephen, which were interpreted by Fra Angelico in a style rich in details, erudite, and where his \\"Christian humanism\\" is expressed in its vertices. The scenes are set in majestic architecture, born from the suggestions of ancient Rome and early Christian times, but not slavish, perhaps mindful of the projects that then circulated in the papal court for the restoration of St. Peter. The figures are solid, calm and solemn, the tone was generally more stately, exemplifying the meditative artist.De Vecchi-Cerchiari, cit., p. 77. The Jubilee celebration of 1475 injected revenue that inspired a number of projects and allowed the Pope to draw a large number of artists together. There were various collaborations between artists such as, Vivarini, Bartolomeo di Tommaso, Benedetto Bonfigli, Andrea del Castagno, Piero della Francesca, and perhaps Rogier van der Weyden. This wealth of ideas prepared the ground for the synthesis towards the end of the century, and led to the creation of a language properly \\"Roman\\".  Sixtus IV (1471–1484)  Melozzo da Forlì, Sixtus IV Appointing Platina as Prefect of the Vatican Library (1477). Pope Sixtus IV created the Vatican Library and entrusted it to the humanist Melozzo da Forlì, the Papal painter. He frescoed one of the emblems of the Roman humanist culture of the time, Pope Sixtus IV Appoints Platina as Prefect of the Vatican Library (1477), in which the pope is portrayed among his relatives in opulent classical architecture. A few years later, under Giuliano della Rovere, Melozzo painted the apse of the Basilica dei Santi Apostoli with Ascension of the Apostles between Playing Angels, considered the first example of the view \\"from down to top\\". The Sistine Chapel takes its name from Pope Sixtus IV, who had the old Cappella Magna restored between 1477 and 1480. It was originally to be decorated by artists from Umbria and Marche. But through the intercession of Lorenzo de' Medici, the commission of the wall decoration was instead entrusted to the best Florentine artists of the time, Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Pinturicchio, Domenico Ghirlandaio, and Cosimo Roselli. They created a series of frescos depicting the Life of Moses and the Life of Christ, offset by papal portraits above and trompe l’oeil drapery below. The work on the frescoes began in 1481 and was concluded in 1482. This is also the date of the works in marble: the screen, the choir stalls, and the pontifical coat of arms over the entrance door. On 15 August 1483 Sixtus IV celebrated the first mass when the chapel was consecrated and dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The Sistine Chapel, now the seat of the most important ceremonies of the papacy, became a point of reference for Renaissance art, setting a milestone for the character developments of the late 15th century.  Alexander VI (1492–1503)  Via della Conciliazione The last part of this century was dominated by the figure of Pope Alexander VI, from the Spanish family Borgia. He first turned his attention to the defence of the Eternal City. He changed the Mausoleum of Hadrian into a fortress, likewise Torre di Nona, to secure the city from naval attacks. His Via Alessandrina, now called Via della Conciliazione, remains to the present day the grand approach to St. Peter's. Though a scandalous pope, he was a patron of the arts and sciences, and in his days a new architectural era was initiated in Rome with the coming of Bramante. Raphael, Michelangelo and Pinturicchio. He commissioned Pinturicchio to lavishly paint a suite of rooms in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican, which are today known as the Borgia Apartments. In addition to the structures erected by himself, his memory is associated with the many others built by monarchs and cardinals at his instigation. During his reign, Bramante designed for Ferdinand II of Aragon the Tempietto di San Pietro in Montorio, on the traditional site of St. Peter's martyrdom. Bramante built for Cardinal Raffaele Riario the Palazzo della Cancelleria. In 1500, the ambassador of Emperor Maximilian laid the cornerstone of the national church of the Germans, Santa Maria dell'Anima, the French Cardinal Briçonnet erected Trinità dei Monti, and the Spaniards Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli. To Alexander we owe the beautiful ceiling of Santa Maria Maggiore, in the decoration of which he employed the first gold brought from America by Columbus. Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel Julius II (1503–1513) In 1503 Julius II was elected pope after the short reign of Pope Pius III. He was chiefly a soldier, and his fame is greatly due to his re- establishment of the Pontifical States and the deliverance of Italy from its subjection to France. But he also gained a reputation as a patron of the arts. Bramante, Raphael, and Michelangelo contributed some of their greatest masterpieces during his time. He laid the cornerstone of the Basilica of St. Peter on 18 April 1506, and united the Vatican Palace with the Villa Belvedere, engaging Bramante to accomplish the project. The famous frescoes of Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel and the Raphael Rooms in the Apostolic Palace, the Court of St. Damasus with its loggias, the Via Giulia and Via della Lungara, even the statue of Moses which graces his tomb in the church of San Pietro in Vincoli, are lasting witnesses of his great love of art. Leo X Leo X was a lover and patron of the arts and sciences, and probably did more than any pope to establish Rome as the centre of European culture. He had San Giovanni dei Fiorentini, on the Via Giulia, built, after designs by Jacopo Sansovino and pressed forward on the reconstruction of St Peter's Basilica and the Vatican under Raphael and Agostino Chigi. The Raphael Cartoons: The Miraculous Draught of Fishes He encouraged painting in particular, and Raphael benefitted enormously under his patronage. \\"Everything pertaining to art the pope turns over to Raphael\\", wrote an ambassador in 1518. He finished the decoration of the Stanze begun under Julius II, even referring to Leo X in some of the scenes. He painted the cartoons for the tapestries of the Sistine Chapel, which represent scenes from the lives of Saints Peter and Paul, the most magnificent of them being St. Peter's miraculous draught of fishes and St. Paul preaching in Athens A third famous enterprise was the decoration of the Vatican Loggia done by Raphael's pupils under his direction, and mostly from his designs. The most exquisite of his paintings are the Sistine Madonna and the Transfiguration. Sculpture was not as favored under Leo X as painting, and while Michelangelo worked on a marble façade for the Church of San Lorenzo in Florence, he did not finish it. The greatest and most difficult task was the continuation of the new St. Peter's. Bramante remained its chief architect until his death in 1514. Raphael succeeded him, but in his six years of office little was done, much to his regret, through lack of means. Leo X has spent all the money carefully saved by his predecessor Julius II. He sold indulgences to help pay for it, a mistake which led to the Reformation.

Etymology Hotaka Shrine At least a thousand years ago, the Azumi people moved into the area and settled there. Originally, the Azumi, or \\"the people who live on the sea\\", lived in northern Kyūshū. They were famed for their skills in fishing and navigation. Between the second and the fourth century, they built a shrine on Shikanoshima island in present-day Fukuoka city in northern Kyūshū. The shrine, Shikaumi Jinja (Shikaumi Shrine), honors the gods of the sea, and has traditionally been administered by members of the Azumi people.Shikaumi Jinja HP . Retrieved January 24, 2010. In the course of time the Azumi people spread to other parts of Honshū, such as the Atsumi peninsula in Aichi Prefecture and Atami in Shizuoka Prefecture. Most of their new settlements were built along seashores, with the exception of the landlocked basin in the mountainous region that was later called Azumidaira and then Azumino. The reason for their choice of this area is still unclear. Hotaka Jinja (Hotaka Shrine), located near Hotaka Station, attests to the connection between this area and Shikaumi Jinja.

Irrigation network (segi) Jikka-segi weir The Azumi Basin was created by numerous streams and rivers that take their water from melting snow on the Northern Alps. The Azusa, Kurosawa, Karasu, and Nakabusa rivers, among others, run through this region and have formed a composite fan (compare alluvial fan) characterized by the low water-holding capacity of the soil.Nagano Prefecture Jikka-segi Land Improvement District, et al. (eds.) (2008). Jikka-segi in Azumino Guide Book. Azumino city, Nagano prefecture.

The Daiō Wasabi Farm is located in the area.Places to Visit in Hotaka Retrieved January 28, 2010. Because of the low water-holding capacity of its soil, the Azumi Basin had been a parched wasteland for many centuries, except for limited small areas close to rivers and springs. The agricultural history of Azumino is almost the same thing as the history of the segi (irrigation network - another local dialect word). Since the Heian period, a number of irrigation networks have been built, for example Ryūda-segi, Nuru-segi, Toba- segi and Iida-segi. These networks are still in service.\\"Azumino Suidoki\\" (History of Azumino), Part 4 of 9 . Retrieved January 29, 2010. But the region had remained unproductive before the innovation of building a segi along a contour line. This type of irrigation network is called yoko-segi (horizontal irrigation network), as opposed to usual tate-segi (vertical irrigation network). In the early Edo period, after many failures, the mayor of Yabara village succeeded in building Yabara-segi along the 545-meter contour line.Azumino Suidoki (History of Azumino), Part 5 of 9 . Retrieved January 29, 2010. This success was followed in 1685 by the building of Kan'zaemon-segi and in 1849 by the Jikka-segi, designated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan as one of the 100 best agricultural waterways. Both were designed to run along a contour line. Today, farm land in the Azumi Basin has twice the density of irrigation as the national average, giving rise to its high agricultural productivity. The main agricultural products are rice and fruits. Notable people from Azumi Basin=Tada Kasuke Tada Kasuke (1638? -1687) was a former Nakagaya village head who led a failed appeal to the magistrate’s office of the Matsumoto Domain, asking for lower taxes. It was in 1686, the third year of the Jōkyō era (1686) of the Edo period, when Azumidaira was part of the Matsumoto Domain under the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate. In the feudal social structure of the time, appealing was strictly forbidden. Tada Kasuke and seven other farmers were caught and executed, along with twenty people from their families, including a sixteen- year-old girl. The incident has been called the Jōkyō Uprising, or the Kasuke Uprising. Kyūsaku Matsuzawa Kyūsaku Matsuzawa (1855–1887) was a newspaper journalist and a people’s rights activist in the Jiyū Minken Undō (Freedom and People's Rights Movement) of the 1870s and 1880s. A talented actor, he had the idea that a play about local hero Tada Kasuke would help educate people about people’s rights. He wrote and produced Minken Kagami Kasuke no Omokage (The Image of Kasuke, a Model of the People’s Rights Movement). The play was a great success and was instrumental in relating farmers’ uprisings to people’s rights at the national level. Aizō Sōma Aizō Sōma (1870–1954) was a Christian philanthropist who founded Shinjuku Nakamuraya. Having received his secondary education in Matsumoto, he studied at Tokyo Senmon Gakkō (now Waseda University), and then at Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaidō University). He returned to Azumidaira and established a successful silk worm business. He was involved in a campaign against drinking and brothels. He was one of the supporters of Kigenji Iguchi (see below).Hirabayashi, James A. (2008). Four Hirabayashi Cousins: A Question of Identity-Part 1 of 5 . Retrieved February 5, 2010. He married a girl named Ryō from Sendai, but she could not get used to rural life, and he moved his family to Tokyo where he founded a successful bakery called Shinjuku Nakamuraya with his wife. Kigenji Iguchi Kigenji Iguchi (1870–1938) was a Christian educator who founded Kensei Gijuku, a small private school in Hotaka, Nagano. While he was studying law in Tokyo at Meiji Law School (now Meiji University), he associated with Uchimura Kanzō and decided to pursue a career as an educator. He returned to Azumidaira and, after overcoming some difficulties typical of rural society, founded the school.

In medicine, the allocation of resources in an urgent situation is prioritized for those with the greatest need and those who would receive the greatest benefit. Similarly, the two parameters of ecological triage are the level of threat and the probability of recovery. Because there are limitations to resources such as time, money, and manpower, it is important to prioritize specific efforts and distribute resources efficiently. Ecological triage differentiates between areas with an attainable emergent need, those who would benefit from preventive measures, and those that are beyond repair.  Methods  Ecological triage is not simple, dichotomous decision making. It involves an array of complex factors including assumptions, mathematical calculations, and planning for uncertainties. When assessing an ecosystem, there are a myriad of factors conservationists consider, but there are also variables which they are unable to account for. Conservationists and scientists often have incomplete understanding of population dynamics, impacts of external threats, and efficacy of different conservation tactics. It is important to incorporate these unknowns when assessing a population or ecosystem. By following the principles of triage, we are able to allow for the efficient allocation of resources as conservationists continue to develop the best options for ecological preservation and restoration.  Info-Gap Decision Model  Due to the multitude of variables within a population or ecosystem, it is important to address the unknown factors which may not initially be accounted for. Many ecologists utilize the Info-gap decision theory, which focuses on strategies that are most likely to succeed despite uncertainties. This process is composed of three main elements: # Mathematical calculations which assess performance as a result of management. This step determines the number of management options, evaluates the existing subpopulations, estimates the management period, and assesses the impact of inaction. # Expectations of performance. To evaluate performance, an extinction-investment curve is utilized. It evaluates data regarding the probability of species extinction (without intervention), budget allocation, and budget required to halve probability of extinction. This step sets forth a threshold below which performance is considered unacceptable. # A model describing uncertainty. The uncertainty model examines the possible values which may render the extinction-investment curve incorrect. It considers how factors may vary in dynamic situations and creates a function of uncertainty.  Criticisms  Some critics of environmental triage believe the process chooses \\"winners\\" and \\"losers\\" and therefore abandons certain demographics. Other criticism argues that ecological triage allows for the government to justify under-funding environmental programs. By utilizing a formal decision-making model, the government can deem certain projects as a lost cause and choose to withhold funding. Critics and supporters alike stress the necessity of expanding the environmental budget to provide the best conservation and restoration efforts.

Neuberg is a Fellow of the Society of Experimental Social Psychology, Association for Psychological Science, Society for Personality and Social Psychology, and the American Psychological Association. He has been Associate Editor of the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, and has served on multiple journal editorial boards and federal grant panels. Selected research (1) With colleagues Douglas Kenrick, Mark Schaller, D. Vaughn Becker, Jon Maner, and Vladas Griskevicius, Neuberg has developed an evolution-informed framework for understanding how fundamental social goals (e.g., self-protection, disease avoidance, social affiliation, status acquisition, mate acquisition, mate retention, child- rearing) shape social perception, attention, categorization, memory, decision making, and behavior.Kenrick, D.

Deep rationality: The evolutionary economics of decision making. Social Cognition, 27, 764-785 In addition to generating a wide range of novel empirical findings, this framework has been employed to re-conceive Abraham Maslow's classic hierarchy of needs.Kenrick, D. T., Griskevicius, V., Neuberg, S. L., & Schaller, M. (in press). Renovating the pyramid of needs: Contemporary extensions built upon ancient foundations. Perspectives on Psychological Science. (2) With Catherine Cottrell and others, Neuberg has employed what he labels a 'sociofunctional approach' to explore issues of prejudice and social valuation. This approach builds on the assumption that human social preferences are significantly (but imperfectly) constrained by their evolved nature as ultrasocial animals and, thus, that people value individuals and groups seen as facilitating effective ingroup functioning and stigmatize those seen as threatening it. Consistent with their theorizing, Cottrell and Neuberg found that people hold qualitatively distinct prejudices against different groups (e.g., that the set of emotions elicited by gay men, for instance, are qualitatively different from the set of emotions elicited by African Americans), and that these prejudices are predictability linked to people's perceptions (whether accurate or not) of the different tangible threats posed by different groups (e.g., to health, values, physical safety).Cottrell, C. A., & Neuberg, S. L. (2005). Different emotional reactions to different groups: A sociofunctional threat-based approach to ‘prejudice.’ Journal of Personality & Social Psychology, 88, 770-789. A second line of work from the sociofunctional approach shows that, whereas people highly desire those they interact with to possess traits specific to the nature of the relationships (e.g., to highly value intelligence in a project team member or extraversion in member of a social club), people powerfully value trustworthiness in any individuals with whom they are highly interdependent, regardless of the domain of interdependence.Cottrell, C. A., Neuberg, S. L., & Li, N. P. (2007). What do people desire in others? A sociofunctional perspective on the importance of different valued characteristics. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 92, 208-231. (3) Susan Fiske and Steven Neuberg developed a prominent model of impression formation (The Continuum Model) that articulates the motivational and informational circumstances that determine the extent to which people employ social category stereotypes versus a target person's individuating characteristics to form an impression of that target.Fiske, S. T., & Neuberg, S. L. (1990). A continuum of impression formation, from category-based to individuating processes: Influences of information and motivation on attention and interpretation. In M. P. Zanna (Ed.), Advances in experimental social psychology (Vol. 23, pp. 1-74). New York: Academic Press.Neuberg, S.L., & Fiske, S.T. (1987). Motivational influences on impression formation: Outcome dependency, accuracy-driven attention, and individuating processes. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53, 431-444. As of early 2010, the Continuum Model had been cited nearly 900 times within the scientific literature.http://isiwebofknowledge.com/ (4) Neuberg also made contributions to the interpersonal self-fulfilling prophecy literature. Interpersonal self- fulfilling prophecies exist when a perceiver's inaccurate expectations for a target lead that perceiver to act in ways that bring about, even unintentionally, target behaviors that objectively support the perceiver's initial erroneous expectations—for instance, when a teacher's inaccurate expectation that a particular student has little potential in math leads that teacher to be less encouraging to that student, thereby leading that student to perform more poorly than she would have otherwise. Neuberg's work showed that such negative expectation effects are moderated by a range of perceiver and target goals: For example, motivating perceivers to be accurate or to be liked, or motivating targets to be self-presentationally assertive, alters the interpersonal dynamics of the perceiver-target interactions and reduces the likelihood of negative self-fulfilling prophecies.Neuberg, S.L.

He presented The View on RTÉ One and The JK Ensemble and Mystery Train on RTÉ lyric fm. He used to present Other Voices. He also presents a one-hour show on RTÉ 2XM called Radio Clash. Early days Kelly studied law at Queen's University Belfast, completed his postgraduate professional qualifications at the Institute of Professional legal studies and then promptly joined the BBC in Belfast to present the radio music show The Bottom Line. In 1991 he won the Sony Award was for best daily music show – The John Kelly Programme. Also in 1991 he won the EMA Award for Television Personality of the Year. He was, at the time, presenting an arts programme 29 Bedford Street. In 1992 he won an EMA Award was for best radio documentary – Maritime Blues which told the story of the club which was at the heart of the Irish rhythm and blues boom and which spawned the likes of Van Morrison and Them. Kelly interviewed just about every key player including Van Morrison and Rory Gallagher. Radio In the late nineties Kelly moved to Dublin to present the groundbreaking Eclectic Ballroom on what was then called Radio Ireland and which later became Today FM – forming a successful night-time partnership with Donal Dineen whose Here Comes the Night immediately followed The Eclectic Ballroom. He moved to RTÉ Radio in 2000 to present Mystery Train and won the PPI Award for Music Broadcaster of the Year. Mystery Train was yet another instant cult classic and a trusted music source for the discerning listener. Elvis Costello showed up regularly to co-present and the show was listened to all over the world. \\"An extraordinary programme\\", said Bono, \\"To go from Duke Ellington to Björk. To go from Woody Guthrie to The Virgin Prunes. It's an amazing thing to pull off. There's nothing like it anywhere in the world.\\" When Mystery Train was suddenly taken off air in 2007 it was an event of some national controversy with the matter being raised in the Irish Senate. The final show was a featured as a news item on the national RTÉ 9 0'clock news and U2 and Elvis Costello appeared in gestures of support. Kelly admitted in interviews that he seriously considered quitting altogether at this time but late in 2008 he moved to RTÉ Lyric FM to present a new and very different show called The JK Ensemble. Although RTÉ Lyric FM has traditionally been a classical music station The JK Ensemble covers everything from J.S. Bach to Brian Eno and from Miles Davis to Sigur Rós. John Kelly surprised everyone with an insistence on playing Igor Stravinsky, John Coltrane, Shostakovich, Lou Reed and Kurt Weill in the middle of the day but, again, the show was an instant success which significantly raised the profile of the station. When Kelly was on leave on one occasion the show was guest presented by two stars of The Wire – Reg. E Cathey and Clarke Peters. Kelly presented the final episode of The JK Ensemble on 11 August 2017. Kelly also presents Radio Clash on the digital channel 2XM which is a mixture of reggae, dub, punk and tracks from contemporary acts like TV on the Radio, White Stripes and Arcade Fire. In 2017, John Kelly re-launched The Mystery Train on RTÉ Lyric FM. The Sunday edition of the show is entitled Mystery Train Sunday Service and features a special guest, who selects the music. Guests have included Neil Hannon, Dorothy Cross, Cillian Murphy, Lisa Dwan and Gavin Friday. Television The View was RTÉ's only arts weekly review programme broadcast on Tuesday nights.It ran from 1999 to 2011. A panel, with Kelly in the chair, and his pals in the other chairs, discussed movies, theatre and the visual arts with a musical performance at the end with acts such as Bono and Edge, Lyle Lovett and Brad Melhdau. The View has also been the scene of the debut performances by many acts including the 2006 winner of the Choice Music Prize Julie Feeney, and Josh Ritter. The View Presents was a separate strand of interview specials where Kelly talked at length with the likes of Seamus Heaney, Neil Jordan, The Edge, Steve Reich and Emmylou Harris. For several seasons he presented the RTÉ music series Other Voices where he introduced artists like Ray Davies, Amy Winehouse and Elbow from a small church in Dingle in County Kerry. Most recently he co-presented the series with BBC Radio 1's Annie Mac. Since 2011 he has presented The Works on RTÉ 1. Interviewer Over the years he has interviewed (for TV, radio and The Irish Times) many leading figures in the music and arts world – Van Morrison, Lou Reed, David Bowie, Seamus Heaney, Nina Simone, Brian Eno, Al Green, Steve Reich, Peter Brook, John McGahern, Solomon Burke, George Martin, Sam Phillips, U2, Brian Wilson, Elvis Costello, Emmylou Harris, Vanessa Redgrave, Yoko Ono, BB King, John Berger, Herbie Hancock, Townes Van Zandt, Laurie Anderson, Mose Allison, Philip Glass, Screaming Jay Hawkins, Jimmy Scott, Philip Lynott, Randy Newman, Peter O'Toole and many more. Miscellaneous Kelly narrated U2's Missing Sarajevo DVD documentary, filmed his own documentary on Elvis Presley in Tennessee and Mississippi and travelled further throughout the United States with the RTÉ travel programme No Frontiers. Other musical trips for radio have taken him to Senegal, Estonia and China. He worked as a music consultant on the Neil Jordan movie The Good Thief – which explains all the Leonard Cohen in the film. Journalism Kelly has written a column for The Irish Times and contributed to numerous other publications on matters musical and cultural. Books At university and immediately afterwards John Kelly was primarily known as a poet and was published in most of the important journals and magazines. He gave many readings in Ireland, Great Britain and the US. Although he had featured in several significant anthologies he never published a volume of his own until 2018 when Notions was published. Instead he took to writing prose. The Little Hammer (Jonathan Cape 2000) and Sophisticated Boom Boom – a novel about music – was also published by Jonathan Cape in 2003. It was singled out for special praise by the writer William Gibson when asked by the (London) Independent what books he had by his bedside. He said it was \\"A universally applicable evocation of male adolescence and of the gifts that music brings.\\" The Little Hammer was also critically well received with the Guardian describing it as, \\"Immediate, passionate and shot through with descriptive brilliance, the narrative voice is both charming and convincing.\\" The List said it was \\"Completely illuminating. A book to be read and savoured.\\" The Guardian called it \\"A witty, inventive, exhilarating novel.\\" His novel From Out of the City was published in 2014 and was shortlisted for the Irish Book Awards.  Poetry  Kelly's debut volume of poetry, Notions, was published in 2018 by Dedalus Press. In his review for the Dublin Review of Books, Gerard Smyth described Notions as an 'impressively accomplished collection' while Caitriona O'Reilly, writing in the Irish Times, praised Kelly's 'poems of great tenderness and linguistic skill'. Music John Kelly has played harmonica on stage with Van Morrison, Tom Robinson, Horslips, Gavin Friday and Paul Brady and also co-wrote half a dozen songs on the Paul Brady album Say What You Feel.

Such posts are manned by border guards and are at all times connected by radio communication with ongoing border patrols in their region and the force headquarters in the interior of the country for their day-to-day functioning, passing on intelligence and for requesting supplies and any needed reinforcements in emergencies. Depending on the length and breath of a country's borders and geography, are located in a wide variety of terrain, including the inhospitable areas that often mark political boundaries. Layout Border outposts, where available, are built on strategic locations which are usually elevated at the highest points in the local terrain and where possible on hilltops along the border. Depending upon international relations with the neighboring country and local strategic needs, BOPs are sometimes built with an assortment of a few administration and residential buildings or tents, an armory, trenches, bunkers, wire obstacles and fortified machine gun positions with a watchtower. A flagpole flying the country's national flag may be located on the premise along with a Wireless Communication Antenna and a designated clearing as a make-do helipad. Peacetime function Border outposts are manned in peacetime by the border guard to check smuggling, infiltration by spies of untrusted neighboring countries, insurgents bent on smuggling weapons and explosives for terrorist attacks and subversive activities, illegal immigration and human trafficking etc.. They usually have watchtowers where soldiers are posted day and night on Sentry duty looking for intruders and illegal cross-border activity of any kind. Patrols go out regularly to patrol the international border to check illegal crossings and track any footprints of those who may have crossed over illegally or attempted to. In case intrusion by foreign elements is confirmed, it is the responsibility of the Border guard based on the BOP to trace the intruders by checking the nearby settlements, villages and towns and inform the law enforcement agencies, Customs and Police authorities.Indian Bollywood film Border (1997) made with the official assistance of the Border Security Force (BSF), Indian Army and Indian Airforce.Indian Bollywood film Refugee (2000) made with the official assistance of the Border Security Force (BSF) Wartime function During wartime however the Border guard, the special forces tasked with patrolling the border in peacetime, withdraw from the Border outposts and provide assistance in a limited capacity to the country's regular Army which then comes and mans all the border outposts at the international border facing the enemy neighboring country. Wartime assistance of the Border guard to the Army is essential as they are familiar with the local terrain having patrolled it on a daily basis during peacetime. During wars these BOPs are reworked into well fortified dug-in positions from where regular Army units can operate to defend the territorial integrity of the country.

It is a subsidiary company of KFR Hollola Oy. The main product of the company is a multilevel float switch, a cable-suspended control device which tilts as the liquid level rises or falls. According to Kari-Finn Oy's own market research, the Kari float switch is the only product on the market that uses a singular switch to operate a number of different functions. The product was invented by the founder of the company, inventor and engineer Mauno Kari. Besides the main product, Kari-Finn Oy also produces many other electrical devices, such as electrode switches based on the conduciveness of liquids, silo switches made for surface level control for loose storage items, temperature-based thermal fuses, watertight pump cable connectors and alarm and control units for pumping stations. In the year 2008, the company manufactured over 50.000 float switches. History Kari-Finn Oy was established in 1965. At first, the company name was T: mi Mauno Kari, later Kari-Finn Ky. Kari-Finn Ky began to make itself the plastic parts it needed for the float switches. And as there was capacity left, it also began to produce plastic parts for other industrial companies in Lahti region. Kari- Finn Ky was divided into two companies in 1988: Kari-Finn Oy making float switches and its subsidiary company Muovisto Oy making plastic parts. In the year 2008, a new parent company, KFR Hollola Oy, was founded. It started to take care of corporations lead services, management, financing actions, and research and development services. At the same time, Kari-Finn Oy and Muovisto Oy became the subsidiary companies of KRF Hollola Oy. Muovisto Oy carried out management buyout in 2015. The corporation employs about 15 people. In 1989 a generation was changed on the company when Mauno Kari's two older sons took the lead of both Kari-Finn Oy and Muovisto Oy while the inventor himself retired. The third and youngest son of the family joined the strength a couple of years later and the change in leadership in both businesses affected the entire operation and evidently lead to its demise. The business closed its doors in February 1990. International awards The Kari multilevel float switch is a well-known and respected product across the globe. In 1977, it was awarded at Brussels International Inventors Fair with a gold medal and Brussels town medal for its global exportation. At that time, the product was being exported to all European countries, the United States, South Africa and Japan. Later, this expanded to Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia among many others.

An order Ornithoscelida was originally proposed by Thomas Henry Huxley but later abandoned in favor of Harry Govier Seeley's division of Dinosauria into Saurischia and Ornithischia. The term was revived in 2017 after a new cladistic analysis by Baron et al.  Huxley's concept  Thomas Henry Huxley originally defined the term in an 1869 lecture as a group comprising two subgroups: the large and heavy-set Dinosauria and the newly discovered Compsognathus, which he placed in a new grouping Compsognatha. The former were defined by their shorter cervical vertebrae, and the femur length exceeding tibia length, and the latter with longer cervical vertebrae, and the femur length shorter than tibia length. He noted that the characteristics of their bones showed many features akin to birds. The dinosaurs Huxley had divided into three families: * Megalosauridae: Teratosaurus, Palaeosaurus, Megalosaurus, Poekilopleuron, Laelaps, and Euskelosaurus (tentatively) * Scelidosauridae: Thecodontosaurus, Scelidosaurus, Hylaeosaurus, Polacanthus (tentatively), and Acanthopholis * Iguanodontidae: Cetiosaurus, Iguanodon, Hypsilophodon, Hadrosaurus, and Stenopelix (tentatively) This classification quickly fell out of use, due to the dominant classification system by Harry Govier Seeley that grouped dinosaurs into two main branches: Saurischia and Ornithischia.  Modern theory  In the beginning of the twenty-first century, improved descriptions of the early ornithischians Heterodontosaurus and Lesothosaurus vastly increased the available information on the origins of the Ornithischia. In March 2017, a paper in the journal Nature by Matthew Baron, David Norman, and Paul Barrett, published an analysis in which the theropod dinosaurs — no longer containing the Herrerasauridae — were more closely related to ornithischian dinosaurs than to the Sauropodomorpha, the group to which the sauropod dinosaurs belong. Previous analyses had rather combined the Theropoda with the Sauropodomorpha into the Saurischia, to the exclusion of the Ornithischia. These groups had also been formally defined to reflect this. Using these standard definitions, the new results would have had the effect of bringing the Ornithischia within the Saurischia and indeed the Theropoda; and the Sauropodomorpha outside the Dinosauria. To avoid this, Baron and colleagues redefined all these groups. Proposing that the Ornithischia and Theropoda were sister groups also meant that a new name was needed for the clade combining them. They named this new clade Ornithoscelida, defining it as \\"the least inclusive clade that includes Passer domesticus and Triceratops horridus.\\" This means that this node clade consists of the last common ancestor of the extant theropod Passer and the ornithischian Triceratops; and all its descendants. Huxley's old name Ornithoscelida was chosen because its meaning, \\"bird legs\\", well fitted the hindlimb traits of the clade. The cladogram below shows the phylogeny from Baron et al. 2017: A follow-up study, presented by Parry, Baron and Vinther (2017), demonstrated how, if using the same dataset, the Ornithoscelida hypothesis can also be recovered using a range of different phylogenetic analysis methods, including Bayesian maximum-likelihood. The same study, when analysing a modified version of the original Baron et al. (2017) dataset, also found some support for the Phytodinosauria hypothesis when using certain types of analysis. The Ornithoscelida hypothesis has been challenged by a team of international researchers in November 2017, following a reworking of the original anatomical dataset from Baron et al. (2017). This reworking produced the traditional model, with Ornithischia and Saurischia recovered as sister-taxa. However, this traditional tree was only weakly supported and not statistically significantly different from the alternative Ornithoscelida hypothesis. With only minor adjustments made by Baron and colleagues in response, Ornithoscelida was found to be preferred over the traditional model once more.

It was Sokurov's first internationally acclaimed feature film, and is the first volume of a planned trilogy whose subject matter is the study of the drama in human relationships. It is followed by Father and Son (2003), and planned to be followed by Two Brothers and a Sister, the final installment, though this last has not been made; his Alexandra (2007) is sometimes considered part of this series, as another film on similar themes. It was entered into the 20th Moscow International Film Festival where it won the Special Silver St. George. Plot The film opens on two human forms, which soon reveal themselves to be that of a young man and a frail old woman. They recline in a silence broken only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey from her sickbed to her deathbed. It is a circular motion which travels a long walk through a dreamlike landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs. These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death. They progress under the leaden and luminous sky of the Baltic, in totally isolated landscapes. From time to time, there is a far away train or a sail on the sea, emphasizing further their isolation from the rest of the world. They return to the house. The son tenderly lowers his mother into her bed that now seems to resemble a coffin. Although he tries to reassure her to the contrary they both know that the end is coming. He leaves her and goes for a long solitary walk. When he returns he weeps for his mother who's died.  Themes  \\"Mother and Son\\" (1997) is a love story, not of romantic love as in \\"Romeo and Juliette\\" or \\"Tristan and Isolde\\", but rather regarding the profound emotional and spiritual ties that exist between a mother and her son. The theme of death and of a mother and son recalls the Christian Passion, only here with the roles reversed – a dying mother, rather than a dying son – which has been called a \\"reverse pietà\\".HFA  Cinematography  The cinematography of the film featured images distorted by filming through painted glass panes, mirrors, and special lenses, together with sounds of \\"whispering wind, crashing waves, and sea-gull cries,\\" creating an elegiac mood. The dreamy landscapes have been compared to the work of Caspar David Friedrich. The painterly cinematography has been compared to the work of Peter Greenaway and Derek Jarman, and the distortions to Stan Brakhage.

It presents a semicircular section, leaning against the wall on the west side just north of Porta Vecchia; the Church of the Santissima Annunziata stood outside the circle in its vicinity. *Tower of Guascone, one of the oldest towers. It stands leaning against the north-eastern part of the wall, not far from Porta Nuova. It presents a rectangular section, and it is dedicated to the commander of the troops who defended Montepescali from the siege of 1555. *Porta Vecchia and Porta Nuova, the two doors of the walls. *Three-pointed bulwark, a feature added to the Roman fortress in the 16th century. Its various renovations of the last century have transformed it into a rooftop terrace. Palazzi *Cassero Senese, a medieval architectural complex that includes the clock tower. It was originally the Convent and Church of Santa Cecilia, then destroyed and became firstly a fortress of the Aldobrandeschi and then a cassero of the Sienese, who later renovated it into a Courthouse. *Palazzo dei Priori, of medieval origin, was the headquarters of the free commune of Montepescali; after the latter lost its independence, the building was sold to some individuals who have renovated it several times at later dates. These altered its appearance, while maintaining the stylistic elements of the construction period. *Palazzo Grottanelli *Palazzo Guadagni *Palazzo Guicciardini Corsi Salviati *Palazzo Tolomei *Palazzo Lazzeretti Concialini Churches *Church of San Niccolò (11th century), preserving a cycle of frescoes of the Sienese school dated 1389. *Church of Santi Stefano e Lorenzo, dating from the twelfth century and it also conserved frescoes of the Sienese school (14th century). *Church of the Santissima Annunziata, built during the 14th century outside the walls in front of the Tower of Belvedere, in subsequent centuries it has been completely transformed into a residential building, losing its original appearance. *The medieval church of San Leonardo, now destroyed. *The Cemetery, built in the 18th century at the behest of the Duke Peter Leopold of Tuscany, it is at the foot of the village. *Church of the Madonna delle Grazie, built outside the country in the 13th century and enlarged in the 17th century. It was deconsecrated and deprived of its decor in the 18th century. Now it is a ruin. *Hermitage of Santa Maria Maddalena, a ruin with style elements from the Romanesque period. It was the seat of Guglielmites before its final abandonment occurred in the 18th century. Museums *Museum of local history Ildebrando Imberciadori, the ethnographic museum of the town. The exhibit areas are home to a collection of farm machinery and tools of farm life, but there is also archaeological evidence and documents that illustrate that a very long time passed between the Etruscan period and the Roman period, the Middle Ages and the Medici era.

Hayman held the rank of Chief Constable of Norfolk Constabulary and Assistant Commissioner for Specialist Operations at London's Metropolitan Police, the highest-ranking officer responsible for counter-terrorism in the United Kingdom. Hayman was directly responsible for the investigation into the 7 July 2005 London bombings. He has also spoken for the Association of Chief Police Officers, first on drugs policy, and later on counter-terrorism. Early career and personal life Born in Essex in 1959, Hayman is married and has two children. He joined Essex Police from school in 1978, rising to the rank of superintendent in 1995 and subsequently to chief superintendent in 1997. In 1998, Hayman transferred to the Metropolitan Police and gained the rank of commander, taking charge of the force's drugs unit, before moving on to head the Directorate of Professional Standards and to serve as an aide to the deputy commissioner. From 1998 to 2005, Hayman was also the spokesman on drugs for the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). In 2002, Hayman was appointed Chief Constable of Norfolk Constabulary, a role in which he established the county's Major Investigation Unit, responsible for providing a quick response to serious crime in Norfolk. While chief constable, Hayman was awarded the Queen's Police Medal in the 2004 Queen's Birthday Honours. Specialist Operations Rejoining the Met in February 2005, Hayman left Norfolk to become the Metropolitan Police Service's Assistant Commissioner for Specialist Operations, a role which placed him in overall charge of counter-terrorism operations conducted by the now defunct Special Branch and the Anti-Terrorist Branch. Six months after taking up the post as head of Specialist Operations, Hayman was the overall head of the investigation into the 7 July 2005 London bombings, the largest criminal investigation in British history. In the 2006 Queen's Birthday Honours he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his handling of the investigation.

They were provided with houses in the Precincts but quickly became non-resident and rented out their properties.

A great beauty and wit, she was the older sister of Françoise de Rochechouart de Mortemart, Madame de Montespan. Biography Gabrielle was the eldest child of Gabriel de Rochechouart de Mortemart and his wife Diane de Grandseigne. She joined the court in 1651 during the Fronde. She originally was placed by her parents in the household of the young king Louis XIV. Later, she joined the household of his younger brother Philippe, duc d'Anjou. Gabrielle and the duc d'Anjou remained close friends for the rest of their lives, even after he succeeded to the duchy of Orléans and became known at court as the notoriously flamboyant homosexual Monsieur. In 1655 she married Claude Leonor Damas de Thianges, Marquis of Thianges. The couple had four children, the third of whom married and had issue. Although she may have been a mistress of Louis XIV, she never gained the power and influence over the king exercised by her younger sister, Madame de Montespan who became the king's maîtresse-en-titre in 1668. Gabrièlle was with her sister during the French military tour when Madame de Montespan became Louis XIV's mistress. She was also with the court when La Montespan gave birth to her daughter by Louis XIV, Mademoiselle de Nantes, at Tournai in June 1673.

It was called the Prosser Plains as it was near the Prosser River. The oldest remaining house dates from 1826, and is called Woodsden. The village was renamed Buckland by the then governor, John Franklin in 1846, gaining its name from William Buckland the Dean of Westminster. The Buckland Inn was built in 1841 and licensed in 1845. Prosser's Plains Post Office opened on 19 October 1838, was renamed Buckland around 1884 and closed in 1981. The St John the Baptist Church foundation stone was laid on 22 August 1846 by Fitzherbert Adams Marriott the arch deacon of Hobart. The foundation stone has an inscription that reads: \\"That God may in this place be glorified, and the prayers and praises of the faithful continually offered until Christ shall come again\\". However the inscription is now on the inside of the wall. On 19 June 2007 black ice caused numerous vehicle accidents in the Buckland area. The Buckland timber mill operated from 1948 till 1981.

The topic includes the recruitment and retention of the appropriate human capital. The design of a CLD strategy allows local governments to manage their territorial and economic development accorded to fixed and legitimized goals instead of having to react to single cases and demands in a short time. The concerned territory can be municipal, inter-municipal or larger. The aim of this article is to present the methodology and tools used for designing a Commercial Location Development strategy. Methodology and tools=Territorial diagnosis The first step consists of assessing the CLD situation at the level of the considered territory. This can be done using both statistical data and interviews of local stakeholders. The collected information is then summarized using i.e. a balanced scorecard (BSC) or SWOT analysis. Competition analysis After having identified the main territorial competitors, these ones are then assessed using as far as possible the same tools as for the territorial diagnosis. The results are then compared in order to determine in which topics and frame conditions the concerned commercial location has to improve to enhance its competitiveness versus its competitors. Benchmarking Ideas for the new strategy are then developed taking inspiration out of a benchmarking analysis and/or a best practices or worst practices inventory.  Designing of a commercial location development strategy The strategy is then designed, democratically validated and implemented.

She has been painting since 1986, and her work is in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria. Life Biddy Rockman Napaljarri is a Walpiri-speaking Indigenous artist from the Western Desert region. Biddy Rockman Napaljarri should not be confused with artist Biddy Napaljarri White (born 1952). 'Napaljarri' (in Warlpiri) or 'Napaltjarri' (in Western Desert dialects) is a skin name, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus 'Biddy Rockman' is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers. Biddy was born circa 1940 in the area of Mongrel Downs station in Western Australia, The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians operate using a different conception of time, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events. Mongrel Downs station was renamed Tanami Downs at the time of it being returned to Indigenous ownership in the 1990s. The area lies in the north-west of the Northern Territory, on the Western Australian border. Biddy was one of six children of Milkila Jungarayi, and her siblings include artists Mona Rockman Napaljarri and Peggy Rockman Napaljarri. Biddy Rockman is one of the traditional owners recognised in the Tanami Downs land claim, under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976. By 2004 she was living in Katherine, Northern Territory. Art=Background Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began painting in 1971, assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all of the founders of the Papunya Tula artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting. However, there was also a desire amongst many of the women to participate, and in the 1990s large numbers of them began to create paintings. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale. Career Biddy Rockman began painting at Lajamanu, Northern Territory, in the central desert, west of Tennant Creek, in 1986. Western Desert artists such as Biddy will frequently paint particular 'dreamings', or stories, for which they have personal responsibility or rights. Johnson's biographical survey of artists in 1994 identified her country as Jarlawangu, and that she painted Ngatijirri (budgerigar) and Warna dreamings, stories that belong to Napaljarri and Nungarrayi women. Works by Biddy Rockman are held by major institutions, including the National Gallery of Victoria. They are also represented in major private collections, such as Nangara (also known as the Ebes Collection).

Daisy Jugadai lived and painted at Haasts Bluff, Northern Territory. There she played a significant role in the establishment of Ikuntji Women's Centre, where many artists of the region have worked. Influenced by the Hermannsburg School, Jugadai's paintings reflect her Tjuukurrpa, the complex spiritual knowledge and relationships between her and her landscape. The paintings also reflect fine observation of the structures of the vegetation and environment. Jugadai's works were selected for exhibition at the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards five times between 1993 and 2001, and she was a section winner in 2000. Her paintings are held in major collections including the National Gallery of Victoria, National Gallery of Australia and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. Life Haasts Bluff, where Daisy Jugadai was born Daisy Jugadai was born circa 1955 at Haasts Bluff, Northern Territory, daughter of artists Narputta Nangala and Timmy Jugadai Tjungurrayi. The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous people operate using a different conception of time from non-Indigenous Australians, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events. The people of Papunya and Haasts Bluff, such as Daisy, speak a variety of the Pintupi language referred to as Pintupi-Luritja, a Western Desert dialect. Napaltjarri (in Western Desert dialects) or Napaljarri (in Warlpiri) is a skin name, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus \\"Daisy Jugadai\\" is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers. Jugadai's childhood was spent at both Haasts Bluff and a nearby camp, Five Mile, while she was schooled at Papunya. She married Kelly Multa, and they had a daughter, Agnes. They lived on an outstation, Kungkayunti, but Daisy moved back to Haasts Bluff when Kelly died. It was not until the 1990s that she was remarried, to an Elcho Islander, after which she travelled regularly between Arnhem Land and Haasts Bluff. Jugadai died in 2008, her funeral held at Haasts Bluff, where she was born. Daisy Jugadai had an older sister, artist Molly Jugadai Napaltjarri, and another sister, Ester, who predeceased her. Art=Background The contemporary Indigenous Australian art movement began in the western desert in 1971, when Indigenous men at Papunya took up painting, led by elders such as Kaapa Tjampitjinpa, and assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. This initiative, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all of the founders of the Papunya Tula artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting. However, many women in the communities wished to participate, and in the 1990s many began to create paintings. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale. Daisy Jugadai came from a family of painters, including her uncle Uta Uta Tjangala and her mother. She learned to draw during her schooling at Papunya and Haasts Bluff, but her first experience as a painter came working on backgrounds for the pictures created by her father. From the Pintupi/Luritja language group, Daisy Jugadai was one of a range of artists who came to painting through the Ikuntji Women's Centre in the early 1990s. She is credited with a significant role in the centre's establishment. She began with screen printing and linocut printmaking, but quickly shifted to acrylic painting, producing many of her best works during the mid-1990s. Western Desert artists such as Daisy Jugadai will frequently paint particular 'dreamings' or Tjukurrpa for which they have personal responsibility or rights. A complex concept, Tjukurrpa refers to the spiritual knowledge of the landscape and custodianship of it; it also refers to laws, rules or stories that people must maintain and re-produce in their communities. Daisy Jugadai portrayed in her art both those for which she had personal responsibility, and those of her late husband and late father. These included honey ant, spinifex and emu dreamings; geographical locations that were the settings for these paintings included Muruntji waterhole and Talabarrdi, and other locations around Kungkayunti, where her family had lived for many years. Career Memory and Five Mile Creek (1995) Throughout the 1990s, Daisy Jugadai was a regular exhibitor at the Araluen Art Centre in Alice Springs, and well as other major exhibitions such as the Australian Heritage Art Awards in Canberra in 1994. Recognition came in 1993, in two forms: an award of a Northern Territory Women's Fellowship; and the purchase by the Araluen Arts Centre of a work exhibited in its annual art award. Within her community she was an administrator as well as an artist. A member of the Ikuntji Women's Centre and a representative on Ikuntji Community Council, Daisy was one of those who successfully lobbied to have artist Marina Strocchi appointed as an art centre coordinator in the early 1990s. The respect between the two women was mutual: Daisy was one of a group of artists whose work was selected for an exhibition that toured regional Australian public galleries in 1999–2000, Ikuntji tjuta – touring, which was curated by Marina Strocchi, the art centre coordinator who had first helped develop the Ikuntji centre in Haasts Bluff some years earlier. Works by Daisy Jugadai are held by the National Gallery of Victoria, National Gallery of Australia and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. They are also held in major private collections, such as Nangara (also known as the Ebes Collection), as well as by Edith Cowan University. First exhibiting in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards in 1993, she was a finalist on several occasions including 1995, 1998 and 2001, and a section winner in 2000. Her 1994 entry in the award, Karu kapingku pungu (Creek after rain), belongs to the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. Her work is also featured alongside other Indigenous artists such as Gloria Petyarre in the Melbourne international airport terminal, completed in 1996. Antiti, near Five Mile, a 1998 painting, has appeared as cover art on an issue of the Medical Journal of Australia. Style Alone amongst the Ikuntji artists, Daisy Jugadai worked at an easel. She cited the Hermannsburg School, a group of Indigenous artists including Albert Namatjira who began painting at Hermannsburg Mission in the 1930s, as an influence on her work. Memory and Five Mile Creek (1995) represents the country of her childhood. It shows the hills of the region in elevation rather than in plan, and represents the range of vegetation typical of that country. Curator Marina Strocchi notes how Daisy Jugadai's painting reflects close observation of the complex structures of the vegetation and environment, its features \\"obsessively detailed\\", with the artist \\"devotedly [including] all the bush tucker of that area\\", as well as choosing \\"a time of year in which to depict her country\\". Vegetation would be carefully painted with a trimmed brush, while even finer detail, such as pollen, would be rendered using a matchstick. Clouds were always the final features to be included. Despite this devotion to detail, Daisy preferred to paint large canvasses. Memory and Five Mile Creek was included in the National Gallery of Victoria's 2004–05 exhibition \\"Aboriginal Art Post 1984\\" and reviewer Miriam Cosic, while noting its \\"naive charm\\", also drew attention to the work's title and the implication that, like other more explicitly political painters of her era, \\"she too is talking of violent dispossession\\". Artist Mandy Martin, who participated in a 2005 collaboration with several painters from the Haasts Bluff region, thought that Daisy's rendering of bush tucker was achieved with a \\"stylised but dazzling personal language\\". Writer and critic Morag Fraser described Daisy's work as \\"extraordinary\\", observing that in Daisy's paintings \\"nature is so wholly internalised, and its rendering so uninhibited.\\" A distinguished artist in her community, her death coincided with a vigorous renewal of artistic expression amongst her successors.

However once Warlayirti Artists was set up, the community went on to become one of Australia's most successful Indigenous art centres. Painting at the centre is a sociable, communal activity, and Susie Bootja Bootja would regularly collaborate with other painters, including her husband. Susie Bootja Bootja was represented by Warlayirti artists at Balgo, where she was living and working in the 1990s. She was one of the strongest painters at Balgo. The work of Balgo artists such as Susie Bootja Bootja, and her fellow artists including Sunfly Tjampitjin and Wimmitji Tjapangarti, are characterised by an expressive style, involving \\"linked dotting and blurred forms and edges\\". Works by Susie Bootja Bootja are held by the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Gallery of Victoria, and the Flinders University Art Museum Collection. She is also represented in major private collections, such as Nangara (also known as the Ebes Collection), the Holmes à Court Collection and the Morven Estate. Works by both Susie Bootja Bootja and her husband were included in a 1991 exhibition 'Yapa: Peintres Aborigenes de Balgo et Lajamanu' in Paris, and in 'Daughters of the Dreaming' at the Art Gallery of Western Australia in 1997. Her paintings feature in Christine Watson's 2003 book, Piercing the Ground: Balgo Women's Image Making and Relationship to Country. Susie Bootja Bootja helped choose the site for, and participated in, a major ceremony for a 1993 Australian Broadcasting Corporation documentary film, Milli Milli. The ceremony, called Wati Kutjarra (Two men) Dreaming, was performed with others including fellow artist Peggy Rockman Napaljarri.

She is the sister of artist Wintjiya Napaltjarri. Tjunkiya's paintings are held in major public art collections, including those of the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory and the National Gallery of Victoria. Life Haasts Bluff, where Tjunkiya's family first settled after she was born, and where she later painted. Tjunkiya was born around 1927: the main biographical reference work for the region gives a date of circa 1927; while the Art Gallery of New South Wales suggests circa 1930. The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians operate using a different conception of time, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events. 'Napaljarri' (in Warlpiri) or 'Napaltjarri' (in Western Desert dialects) is a skin name, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus 'Tjunkiya ' is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers. A Pintupi speaker, Tjunkiya was born in the area northwest of Walungurru (known as Kintore, Northern Territory), near the Western Australian border, and west of Alice Springs), after which her family moved to Haasts Bluff. She became second wife to Toba Tjakamarra, father of one of the prominent founders of the Papunya Tula art movement, Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula. At Haasts Bluff she had ten children: these included sons Billy Rowe and Riley Rowe, both of whom painted for Papunya Tula, and daughter Mitjili (born c. 1948), who married Long Tom Tjapanangka and went on to paint at Haasts Bluff. From Haasts Bluff the family moved to Papunya and in 1981 to Kintore. Tjunkiya was the sister of artist Wintjiya Napaltjarri, who was also a wife to Toba. Seriously ill in the mid-1990s, Tjunkiya died in 2009. Art=Background Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began painting in 1971, assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all of the founders of the Papunya Tula artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting. However, there was also a desire amongst many of the women to participate, and in the 1990s large numbers of them began to create paintings. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale. Career Like a number of the other central and western desert women in the region, Tjunkiya was introduced to painting through the Minyma Tjukurrpa (Women's Dreaming) painting project in the mid-1990s. Along with sister Wintjiya and other women, she participated in a painting camp in 1994 which resulted in \\"a series of very large collaborative canvases of the group's shared Dreamings\\". Western Desert artists such as Tjunkiya frequently paint particular 'dreamings', or stories, for which they have responsibility or rights. In this case, twenty-five women were involved in planning the works, which included three canvases that were 3 metres square, as well as two that were 3 by 1.5 metres, and Tjunkiya and Wintjiya performed a ceremonial dance as part of the preparations. Tjunkiya and her sister were determined to participate in the project despite cataracts interfering with their vision. Sources differ on when Tjunkiya and her sister Wintjiya had the cataracts removed: Vivien Johnson implies around 1999, but art centre coordinator Marina Strocchi, who worked closely with the women, states that both had the operation in 1994. In the early 2000s she and her sister painted at Kintore, but in 2008 they were working from their home: \\"the widows' camp outside her 'son' Turkey Tolson's former residence\\". Tjunkiya and her sister Wintjiya did not confine their activities to painting canvases. The National Gallery of Victoria in 2001 purchased a collaborative batik work, created in 1994 by the sisters in cooperation with several other artists, together with a work completed by Tjunkiya alone. The sisters also worked using drypoint etching, with 2004 a print by Tjunkiya – Rumiya kutjarra #2 – held by the National Gallery of Australia. Works by Tjunkiya are held in major private collections, such as Nangara (also known as the Ebes Collection). Her work has been acquired by the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, and the Northern Territory Supreme Court. Works by both Tjunkiya and her sister Wintjiya are traded in the auction market, fetching prices of a few thousand dollars. In 1996, Tjunkiya was represented in the Papunya Women group exhibition at Utopia Art Gallery in Sydney, while in 2000 she had an exhibition at Melbourne's William Mora Galleries and was included in the Art Gallery of New South Wales' major exhibition, Papunya Tula: Genesis and Genius.

She is the sister of artist Tjunkiya Napaltjarri; both were wives of Toba Tjakamarra, with whom Wintjiya had five children. Wintjiya's involvement in contemporary Indigenous Australian art began in 1994 at Haasts Bluff, when she participated in a group painting project and in the creation of batik fabrics. She has also been a printmaker, using drypoint etching. Her paintings typically use an iconography that represents the eggs of the flying ant (waturnuma) and hair- string skirts (nyimparra). Her palette generally involves strong red or black against a white background. A finalist in the 2007 and 2008 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards, Wintjiya's work is held in several of Australia's public collections including the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, the National Gallery of Australia and the National Gallery of Victoria. Her work is also held in the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection of the University of Virginia. Life Haasts Bluff, where Wintjiya's family first settled after she was born, and where she began painting A 2004 reference work on Western Desert painters suggests Wintjiya was born in about 1923; the Art Gallery of New South Wales suggests 1932; expert Vivien Johnson reports two possible years: 1932 or 1934. The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians have a different conception of time, often estimating dates by comparisons with the occurrence of other events. Napaljarri (in Warlpiri) or Napaltjarri (in Western Desert dialects) is a skin name, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems. Although often used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus Wintjiya is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers. She is sometimes referred to as Wintjia Napaltjarri No. 1; there is another artist from the same region, Wintjiya Morgan Napaljarri (also called Wintjiya Reid Napaltjarri), who is known as Wintjiya No. 2. Wintjiya came from an area north-west or north-east of Wa _l_ ungurru (the Pintupi-language name for Kintore, Northern Territory). Johnson reports that Wintjiya was born at Mulparingya, \\"a swamp and spring to the northeast of Kintore\\", west of Alice Springs. As was the case for a number of artists from the region, Wintjiya's family walked into the Haasts Bluff settlement in the 1950s, moving to Papunya in the 1960s. In 1981, Kintore was established and the family moved there. Her native language is Pintupi, and she speaks almost no English. She is the sister of artist Tjunkiya Napaltjarri, the two women being the second and third wives of Toba Tjakamarra, father (by his first wife, Nganyima Napaltjarri) of one of the prominent founders of the Papunya Tula art movement, Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula. Wintjiya and Toba had five children: sons Bundy (born 1953) and Lindsay (born 1961 and now deceased); and daughters Rubilee (born 1955), Claire (born 1958) and Eileen (born 1960). Superficially frail by 2008, she nevertheless had the stamina and agility to teach her granddaughter the skills of chasing and capturing goannas. Art=Background A 2006 untitled work by Wintjiya, showing her characteristic palette (stark white with red or black) and iconography (symbols representing the eggs of the flying ant (waturnuma) and hair-string skirts (nyimparra). Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began in 1971 when Indigenous men at Papunya created murals and canvases using western art materials, assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly after the introduction of a government- sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and '90s, such work was being exhibited internationally.

In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale. Career Since the 1970s Wintjiya had created artefacts such as ininti seed necklaces, mats and baskets, using traditional artistic techniques including weaving of spinifex grass. When the women of Kintore, including sisters Wintjiya and Tjunkiya, started creating canvasses, their works bore little resemblance to those of their male peers (who had been painting for some years). Wintjiya's first efforts were collaborative, as one of a group of women who created murals on the Kintore Women's Centre walls in 1992. She then joined a painting camp with other women from Kintore and Haasts Bluff to produce \\"a series of very large collaborative canvases of the group's shared Dreamings\\" (dreamings are stories used to pass \\"important knowledge, cultural values and belief systems\\" from generation to generation). Twenty-five women were involved in planning the works, which included three canvases that were square, as well as two that were ; Tjunkiya and Wintjiya performed a ceremonial dance as part of the preparations. Wintjiya and her sister were determined to participate in the project despite cataracts interfering with their vision. As was the case for Makinti Napanangka, an operation to remove cataracts resulted in a new brightness to Wintjiya's compositions. Sources differ on when Wintjiya and her sister Tjunkiya had their cataracts removed: Johnson suggests 1999, but art centre coordinator Marina Strocchi, who worked closely with the women, states that it was 1994. In the early 2000s Wintjiya and her sister painted at Kintore, but in 2008 they were working from their home: \\"the widows' camp outside her 'son' Turkey Tolson's former residence\\". Tjunkiya and her sister Wintjiya did not confine their activities to painting canvases. In 2001 the National Gallery of Victoria purchased a collaborative batik, created by the sisters in cooperation with several other artists, together with one completed by Wintjiya alone. These works were the product of a batik workshop run for the women of Haasts Bluff by Northern Territory Education Department staff Jill Squires and Therese Honan in the months following June 1994. The works, including several by Wintjiya, were not completed until 1995. Circular markings, used by Wintjiya in both these batiks and her subsequent paintings, represent the eggs of the flying ant (waturnuma), one of the main subjects of her art. She also portrays \\"tree-like organic motifs\\" and representations of hair-string skirts (nyimparra). The sisters also gained experience with drypoint etching; works produced by Wintjiya in 2004 – Watiyawanu and Nyimpara – are held by the National Gallery of Australia. Wintjiya's work was included in a survey of the history of Papunya Tula painting hosted by Flinders University in the late 1990s. Reviewing the exhibition, Christine Nicholls remarked of Wintjiya's Watanuma that it was a germinal painting, with fine use of muted colour, and showed sensitivity to the relationships between objects and spaces represented in the work. Likewise, Marina Strocchi has noted the contrast between some of the subtle colours used in batik and Wintjiya's characteristic painting palette, which is \\"almost exclusively stark white with black or red\\". Hetti Perkins and Margie West have suggested that in paintings by Kintore women artists such as Wintjiya and Tjunkiya, \\"the viscosity of the painting's surface seems to mimic the generous application of body paint in women's ceremonies\\". Wintjiya's painting Rock holes west of Kintore was a finalist in the 2007 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award. Another of her works, Country west of Kintore, was accepted as a finalist in 2008. Works by Wintjiya have appeared in many significant exhibitions including: Papunya Women group exhibition (Utopia Art Gallery, Sydney, 1996); Raiki Wara: Long Cloth from Aboriginal Australia and the Torres Strait (National Gallery of Victoria 1998–99); Twenty-five Years and Beyond: Papunya Tula Painting (Flinders University Art Museum, 1999); Papunya Tula: Genesis and Genius (Art Gallery of New South Wales, 2000) and Land Marks (National Gallery of Victoria, 2006). Her first solo exhibition was at Wolloongabba Art Gallery in Brisbane in 2005, while in 2010 there was one at a Melbourne gallery. Also in 2010, a print by Wintjiya was selected for inclusion in the annual Fremantle Arts Centre's Print Award. In 2013, she was one of sixteen finalists in the Western Australian Indigenous Art Awards. Works by Wintjiya are held in major private collections such as Nangara (also known as the Ebes Collection). Her work has been acquired by several major public art institutions including the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, and the National Gallery of Victoria.

For example, many languages have covert grammatical gender in nouns, in that there is no way to tell from the form of a noun which gender it is; gender only becomes apparent in, for example, articles and adjectival agreement, which depend on gender. In German instruction, the article (der, die, das) is generally taught along with a noun, so that the student may remember which gender the noun is. In spoken French, grammatical number is largely covert: the singular and plural forms of most nouns are identical in pronunciation. However, number is still relevant, as it affects articles and verbal agreement, so it is still logical to say that one instance of a noun is singular, and that another instance, pronounced identically, is plural. A covert feature is different from a null morpheme, such as the English singular, which is marked by the absence of a morpheme that occurs elsewhere. That is, whereas in English the null-marked singular contrasts with an overt -s plural in most nouns, in French both singular and plural are null; in English it is clear that cat is singular, because it is not the plural cats, whereas in spoken French, it cannot be known whether chat(s) spoken in isolation is singular or plural.

This image was taken early in King George V's career before the addition of Type 282 radar. \\"Pom-Pom\\" director was a director for British anti-aircraft guns on British warships of the 1930s into the Second World War. Development The Vickers 40 mm QF 2 pounder \\"Pom-Pom\\" gun anti-aircraft mounting was introduced to the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. The multi-barrel mounting was capable of a tremendous volume of fire but the crew had great difficulty in aiming the mounting due to the smoke and vibration created by the guns. It was, therefore, essential to aim the mount from a remote location, using a director that had a clear view, free from smoke and vibration. The director crew would aim at the target aircraft and, in the early versions of the director, cause the layer (altitude) and trainer (azimuth) pointers to rotate on the gun mount. The gun crew would then move the mount to match the pointers rather than having to try and aim at the target aircraft. Mark I - III directors Directors I to III controlled the gun mounting through \\"follow the pointer\\" control and aimed at aircraft using eye shooting techniques through a simple ring sight.Raven and Roberts, British Battleships of World War Two, p429 These directors began to appear on Royal Navy cruisers, battleships and aircraft carriers in 1930. They were universally fitted, one per pom-pom gun mounting, by the late 1930s.Raven and Roberts, British Battleships of World War Two, p159 Most destroyers and smaller ships that carried 2-pounder guns continued to rely on aiming the guns with the on-mount gunsights due to the lack of space on these ships to site a director.Campbell, Naval Weapons of WW2 Director Mark IV The Mk IV director was a considerable improvement and used gyroscopes in a gyro rate unit coupled to an optical rangefinder and Type 282 radar to determine the range, speed and direction of enemy aircraft and then used an on-director computer to produce an accurate fire control solution to hit the target. Later versions of the Mk IV director introduced remote power control (RPC) and could control the gun mounting by remote control from the director.Campbell, Naval Weapons of World War Two, p20 The Mk IV director was fully tachymetric, but performance suffered as the director was not stabilized against the movement of the ship. It consequently required a carefully trained crew (a total of eight including the radar operator in the radar office) to achieve good results.Campbell, Naval Weapons of World War Two,p20 Even so, the Mk IV director was highly advanced and placed the Royal Navy in the forefront of naval anti-aircraft fire controlCampbell, Naval Weapons of World War Two, pages 113, 178, 226 and 319. Campbell notes that the first USN tachymetric 40mm gun directors did not appear until 1942, while neither the Italian, German nor the Japanese navy had comparable close range AA directors. when it was introduced to the Royal Navy on in 1940.Raven and Roberts, British Battleships of World War Two, p429 Later versions were upgraded with Type 282 radar and RPC beginning in 1941, with HMS Prince of Wales being one of the first ships to receive the radar upgrade, which she first used in action during Operation Halberd.Tarrant, King George V class Battleships, p88 See also * List of anti-aircraft guns Notes and referencesExternal links * The Pom-Pom Director, Mark IV in The Gunnery Pocket Book, B.R. 224/45, 1945 placed online courtesy of Historic Naval Ships Association * Illustration of the Pom-Pom Director, Mark IV in The Gunnery Pocket Book, B.R. 224/45, 1945 placed online courtesy of Historic Naval Ships Association Category:Artillery operation Category:Naval guns of the United Kingdom Category:Military computers de:Ordnance QF 2-Pfünder-Marinegeschütz it:2 libbre navale ja:ポンポン砲 pl:Armata przeciwlotnicza 40 mm Mark VIII ","title":"Pom-Pom director"},{"id":"25790777","text":"Ceidio is a former civil parish in the Welsh county of Gwynedd.

It is currently thought to be extinct, but may still survive in old orchards or gardens. History The Styre originated in the Forest of Dean, where it grew well on the local thin limestone soils: in common with a handful of other old apple varieties, it could be simply propagated without grafting, by striking root from branches pulled from the tree's crown.Martell, C. Native Apples of Gloucestershire , p.102 Although the variety's age is unknown, it was clearly very old, its name having a possible Anglo-Saxon root.Martell, C. Native Apples of Gloucestershire , p.102 The Styre had a reputation for producing a valuable, exceptionally flavoursome and unusually strong cider. John Philips, in his 1708 poem Cyder, refers to it as \\"Stirom, firmest fruit\\", and describes it as making a long-lasting, smooth, yet deceptively strong drink.Philips, J. Cyder, ii. The pioneer American pomologist and politician William Coxe, Jr. grew a number of specimens of the Styre in his orchard in Burlington, New Jersey, and commented in 1817 that the variety was even then \\"supposed to have passed the zenith of its perfection, and to be rapidly declining [in Herefordshire]\\", though his own trees attracted attention for their luxuriant growth.Coxe, W. A view of the cultivation of fruit trees, M. Carey & Son, 1817, p.25 A number of other authors in this period commented that the Styre's productiveness and quality was in decline. It has been retrospectively suggested that this was because the Styre was a triploid apple, and in later years lacked suitable cross-pollinators, meaning that it fruited poorly.Martell, C. Native Apples of Gloucestershire , p.102 Older apple varieties may also suffer from a build-up of viruses in their tissues over time.Martell, p.130 By the mid 19th century, the variety was already becoming uncommon, replaced by more modern cultivars. Writing in 1858, H. G. Nicholls commented \\"Cider obtained from the styre apple used to be a common beverage; but that fruit has long been extinct\\".The Forest of Dean - A Historical and Descriptive Account, 1858, p.151 By 1898 another writer stated it was \\"almost extinct\\", commenting that old writers reported it yielded a \\"rich, full- flavoured and strong cider\\", commanding a high price, on the right soils.Cooke, C. W. R. A Book about cider and Perry, H. Cox, 1898, p.19 In fact, the Forest Styre seems to have survived for many years afterwards in some areas. It was last known of by staff of the Long Ashton Research Station at a farm in Aylburton in the late 1950s, and what was said to be the final recorded tree of the variety, at Halmore in the Vale of Berkeley, was not cut down until 1968.Gloucestershire Orchard Group Newsletter, 13 (Spring 2008), 24 Pomologists are currently searching for any surviving specimens of the Forest Styre.Gloucestershire Orchard Group Newsletter, 13 (Spring 2008), 24 Characteristics The Styre is, or was, characterised by small fruit with a pale yellow skin and a red blush on the fruit's sunward side; the fruit were borne on a very short stalk.Hogg, R. British Pomology, p.86 It was probably a full 'bittersharp' type apple, high in tannin and acid. As well as producing good cider, the initially acidic flesh became sweet, honey-like and edible with keeping.Martell, p.101 The tree itself was very large and had a vigorous upright growth, though it tended to run to wood and did not always fruit well.

He fought with the No. 11 Commando unit and French Resistance forces, becoming infamous among Axis forces as the \\"Kilted Killer\\". He caused so much damage to enemy military infrastructure, a bounty of 300,000 francs was placed upon his head. He was awarded the Military Cross and the Croix de Guerre three times, and the Légion d'honneur. Origins and education Macpherson was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was youngest of seven children of Sir Thomas Stewart Macpherson CIE LLD and Helen, the daughter of the Reverend Archibald Borland Cameron. His father's brother was the first Baron Strathcarron and one of his own brothers, Niall, was also raised to the peerage as Baron Drumalbyn. Another brother was G. P. S. (Phil) Macpherson, captain of Scotland's first Grand Slam winning rugby side in 1925. The family originates from Newtonmore, in the Highlands, yet he was raised in the city. His childhood home was Edgebrooke, in East Fettes Avenue, and he attended Edinburgh Academy prep school before Cargilfield, in Barnton. At 14, he went to Fettes College, where he joined the Officers' Training Corps. He also attended Trinity College, Oxford, where he was awarded a first class degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. He represented Oxford at rugby, hockey and athletics and was also an international student athlete, representing the UK in the 1500 Meters at the 1947 Universiade, the precursor of the World Student Games. Military career Macpherson was commissioned in the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders Territorial Army in 1939, before serving in No. 11 (Scottish) Commando in 1940-1941. Macpherson was part of a four-man team sent to reconnoitre beaches in preparation for Operation Flipper, an attempted raid on the headquarters of Erwin Rommel, the famous German Field Marshal. In two canvas folboats, they waited at sea for their rendezvous with a submarine which was to return them to their base at Apollonia. After two nights, the submarine had not appeared and one boat was leaking, so the men decided to land again and make a final attempt in one boat, but in the end the weather was too bad. They then decided to walk to Tobruk, despite the fact they had no food, water or maps, and were dressed only in shorts. Captain Ratcliffe and Lieutenant Ravenscroft were captured on 2 November, Macpherson and Corporal Evans managed to hold out for another day before they too were captured by Italian forces near Derna. Interrogated by four army officers and six carabinieri, one asked MacPherson to demonstrate how his Colt Automatic worked, he did so \\"by putting in a spare magazine [he] still had, and then held the party up with the loaded weapon\\". Unfortunately, he then suffered a severe attack of cramp, and was recaptured and placed in solitary confinement. He made one further escape attempt before being taken to Italy in a destroyer, and held in a prisoner of war camp at Montalbo; here he made a further escape attempt, breaching the inner perimeter, but he could not find a way over the outer fence. In June 1942 he was moved to another camp at Gavi, near Genoa. After the Italian armistice the camp was taken over by German forces on 9 September 1943, and the prisoners transferred to German prisoner of war camps from 14 September when they were taken by road to Acqui. From here they were to be taken by train to Austria. Macpherson managed to get away from his guards, but was soon recaptured, and almost shot; fortunately the order by a feldwebel (NCO) was countermanded by an officer. The prisoners were then transported by train to Stalag XVIII-A at Spittal an der Drau, Austria. On arrival at this camp, Macpherson and a New Zealander, Captain Colin Norman Armstrong managed to hide from the Germans whenever they tried to take a roll call, and obtained assistance from the French held in a different part of the camp, escaping in French uniforms on 21 September, also accompanied by a Captain A. A. Yeoman. They managed to recross the Italian border, and were intending to make their way into Yugoslavia and link up with Allied-supported partisans there. Unfortunately, Armstrong became separated, and on 26 September Macpherson and Armstrong ran into a German patrol near Chiusaforte, Macpherson spoke to the patrol in Italian, pretending to be an Italian officer, and tried to convince the patrol that Armstrong was Croatian. The Red Cross rations they were carrying revealed their true status, and they were sent to a camp in Hohenstein, arriving on 30 September after a five-day train journey with only a small amount of bread to eat and little water. On 1 October they were transferred to Stalag XX-A at Toruń, Poland. On 9 October they escaped again, with assistance from Private Hutson and Sergeant Glancy. The four then managed to travel to Sweden via Bromberg and Gdynia; flying back to Kinloss, Scotland on 4 November 1943, two years after he had been captured in Egypt. On 17 February 1944, Macpherson was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for his escape. Operation Jedburgh Within a few days of returning to Great Britain, McPherson was instructed to report to Milton Hall in the Soke of Peterborough. There he discovered he was to be part of Operation Jedburgh. Under this operation three-man units were to be dropped into occupied Europe to carry out sabotage and guerrilla warfare, acting as a high-profile focus for the local resistance. His training lasted from January to March 1944, at the end of which he was promoted to Major and placed in charge of team Quinine. His team members were a French lieutenant, Michel de Bourbon, and a British radio operator, Sergeant Arthur Brown. French Guerrilla operations On the night of 8 June they were parachuted into Aurillac to liaise with resistance unit led by Bernard Cournil. Under his jumping smock, Macpherson was wearing full Cameron Highland battle dress, including a tartan kilt. \\"Just as I arrived I heard an excited young Frenchman saying to his boss, 'Chef, chef, there's a French officer and he's brought his wife!\\". \\"Their mistaking me for a woman wearing a skirt was an easy error to make.\\" He later explained, \\"As a British officer parachuted into a resistance situation...your only authority was your own personality, which I had tried to reinforce with my kilt and a degree of flamboyance\\". To motivate the resistance unit, Macpherson decided on immediate action. On the next night (9 June) they demolished a railway bridge on the Aurillac-Maurs line. The following day they were contacted by two resistance fighters from Bretenoux, who told Macpherson that the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich were advancing towards the Normandy beachhead via the Figeac-Tulle road. Macpherson realised that the best they could do was delay the division's progress by preparing a series of ambushes. During the night they mined the road and the surrounding trees. At the first ambush they blew the tracks off the leading armoured vehicle, thus blocking the road. Then, as the Germans began to work through the trees to outflank them, the resistance fighters brought down the trees and withdrew They then switched to attacking road and rail routes between Brive and Montauban, eventually completely stopping railway traffic between Cahors and Souillac, Lot on 1 July. Similar operations continued through July, and following Operation Dragoon (the Allied invasion of Southern France, aimed at capturing Marseille), operations increased in scale. In one attack Macpherson and his men trapped 300 Germans and 100 members of the Milice (Pro-German French forces) in a railway tunnel for several days. Over the course of the next two months Macpherson killed or captured many German troops and systematically blew apart bridges. He operated from caves and woodland areas with his radio operator. Under the mantle of Agent Quinine, he achieved an operation of some kind virtually every day, his high-profile presence – he brazenly toured the countryside in a black Citroën with a Union Flag pennant on one side and a Croix de Lorraine on the other - infuriating the Nazis to the extent that they placed a 300,000 franc bounty on his head, describing him as \\"A bandit masquerading as a Scottish officer and extremely dangerous to the citizens of France\\". On one occasion when a German staff car was approaching a level crossing Macpherson booby-trapped the barrier arm so it crashed down on the vehicle, decapitating the local commandant and his driver. As axis forces in the south of France were cut off by the Allied advance, Macpherson negotiated the surrender of two German units, the most notable being FK541. This was an assortment of Axis forces, totaling 23,000 men and while mainly second line soldiers it did include 7000 front line troops. It was the command of Major General Botho Henning Elster.Also referred to as Erich Elster Macpherson was informed by another Jedburgh leader Captain Arthur Cox that the Major General wanted to negotiate surrender. A meeting had already been held with the Americans, conducted by Lieutenant Samuel Magill, but it was felt that Germans were prevaricating, so another meeting was set up in a village in Allied hands. Unarmed and accompanied by a German doctor and a French officer, Macpherson was driven in a captured German Red Cross vehicle through miles of enemy-held territory, through machine gun fire, to the village's school house. Dressed in full Highland uniform complete with bonnet, he bluffed that he would unleash heavy artillery and call on the RAF if the Germans did not surrender. The Major General agreed on condition his forces were allowed to keep their side arms until they were in safe custody of the US 83rd infantry division.When the Allied officers were interviewed by the press immediately after the surrender, Lieutenant Samuel Magill did the talking, but Macpherson, as trained, said nothing. Hence many histories credit this surrender solely due to the efforts of the US 83rd Infantry Division Italian Guerrilla operations In November 1944, Major Macpherson led Italian partisans in several major attacks on railways in Udine, northern Italy, despite being wounded soon after his arrival. Much of this effort was aimed at disrupting the German defensive line based on Tarvisio. On one occasion during an Allied air raid Macpherson spotted a group of Italian officers retreating into a bomb shelter. The Scot opened the shelter hatch and threw a grenade down it. Macpherson was shot by an Italian officer, who arrived late but whom he succeeded in stabbing after a struggle. Post war After the war he reverted to the rank of lieutenant and continued to serve in the Territorial Army with the Camerons. He was promoted back to captain on 1 September 1948, and awarded the Territorial Decoration on 20 June 1950. During this period (1947 to 1952) he was attached to 21 SAS TA. On 2 August 1960 he was promoted back to major, and transferred to the Gordon Highlanders. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 31 October 1961, and until 1 November 1964 he commanded the London Scottish (TA - then affiliated with the Gordon Highlanders), he was then promoted colonel. He transferred to Class III of the reserve on 1 April 1967, and was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1968 New Year Honours. His CBE was for his services as deputy commander of 56th Infantry Brigade from 1964 to 1967, and his efforts in support of the TA in general. He is a member of the Royal Company of Archers. On 7 October 2010, Macpherson's autobiography was published under the title, Behind Enemy Lines.by Sir Tommy Macpherson and Richard Bath, Mainstream Publishing, 2010. Business career Macpherson had enjoyed a successful business career, including periods variously as the Managing Director and Chairman of the Mallinson-Denny Group, as a director of Brooke Bond Group, Scottish Mutual Assurance Society and the National Coal Board, and as Chairman of Annington Holdings plc and Boustead plc. While with Mallinson Denny, he was a member of the National Board for Prices and Incomes between 1965 and 1967. He was President of Eurochambres (the Association of European Chambers of Commerce) between 1992 and 1994. Honours Macpherson was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Greater London in 1977, and served as High Sheriff of Greater London in 1983. He was knighted in the 1992 New Year Honours, receiving the accolade from the Queen at Buckingham Palace on 17 March 1992. In 1985/86 he served as Prime Warden of the Worshipful Company of Dyers and between 2001 and 2005 he was President of the Highland Society of London. Beside his British decorations, he was also a Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur and was awarded the Croix de Guerre (2 Palms and Star) and was personally awarded a papal knighthood from the Pope. Private life In 1953 Macpherson married Jean Henrietta, the daughter of David Butler Wilson. She is a patroness of the Royal Caledonian Ball. They had two sons and a daughter. Macpherson's seat in the Highlands, Biallid House, near Newtonmore, was in the heart of the ancestral lands of the Clan Macpherson. He died aged 94 on 6 November 2014. A memorial service was held at St Columba's Church of Scotland in Pont Street, Knightsbridge, London, with the eulogy given by Malcolm Rifkind. Others present included Jeffrey Archer and his wife, Gregory Lauder-Frost, and Mr & Mrs Alexander Hay of Duns Castle, Berwickshire.Daily Telegraph, 20 February 2015, Court & Social page.

Born on what is now Tanami Downs pastoral station in the Northern Territory, she learned English when working as a child with a white mining family; Peggy Rockman and her family were subsequently relocated by government authorities to Lajamanu, a new community west of Tennant Creek. Peggy Rockman is one of the traditional owners of Tanami Downs. Since first learning painting through an adult education course in 1986, Peggy Rockman has painted particular 'dreamings', including Ngatijirri (budgerigar), Warna (snake), Laju and Ngarlu. Her work is in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. She has co-written Yimikirli: Warlpiri Dreamings and Histories, a collection of texts in the Warlpiri language with English translations. Life Peggy Rockman was born around 1940. The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians operate using a different conception of time, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events. Some sources give only \\"Lima\\" as a location; a more detailed account suggests she was born at Mungkururrpa, on Tanami Downs (formerly Mongrel Downs), a pastoral station in Australia's Northern Territory. Her name given at birth was Yalurrngali: Peggy Rockman was a name subsequently given to her by white administrators. 'Napaljarri' (in Warlpiri) or 'Napaltjarri' (in Western Desert dialects) is a skin name, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus 'Peggy Rockman' is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers. Peggy Rockman had three older sisters, all of whom married Jampu Jakamarra, to whom Peggy herself would also later be married. Her family first settled alongside white Australians – a couple mining gold in the Tanami Desert – when she was aged between six and eight. While still a child herself, she worked caring for the mining family's children, during which time she became a proficient English speaker. After the mine was abandoned, Peggy Rockman's family returned to a nomadic existence in the region, before settling for a time at a pastoral station called Gordon Downs. Around 1952, the family was taken by the government's Native Affairs Branch to a new settlement called Lajamanu, in the central desert west of Tennant Creek, Northern Territory. There, Peggy Rockman was required to work full-time in the settlement's kitchens, being paid with meals, and occasionally also with rations. At the settlement, she had three children with Jampu Jakamarra. Peggy Rockman was one of six children of Milkila Jungarayi, and her siblings include artists Biddy Rockman Napaljarri and Mona Rockman Napaljarri. Peggy Rockman is one of the traditional owners recognised in the Tanami Downs land claim, under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976. Biographies published in 1994 and 2003 both indicated that she was living in the Lajamanu area, but by 2010 she had settled in Katherine, Northern Territory. Art=Background Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began painting in 1971, assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all of the founders of the Papunya Tula artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting. However, there was also a desire amongst many of the women to participate, and in the 1990s large numbers of them began to create paintings. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale. Career Peggy Rockman was one of a number of artists who first learned painting through a course run in 1986 at Lajamanu by an adult education officer, John Quinn, associated with the local Technical and Further Education unit. The course, initially attended only by men, eventually enrolled over a hundred community members. Others who began their painting careers through that course include Mona Rockman Napaljarri and Louisa Napaljarri. Western Desert artists such as Peggy Rockman will frequently paint particular 'dreamings', or stories, for which they have personal responsibility or rights, which in Peggy's case include Ngatijirri (budgerigar), Warna (snake), Laju and Ngarlu. Peggy Rockman, together with linguist Lee Cataldi, wrote Yimikirli: Warlpiri Dreamings and Histories, a work sponsored by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, and published in 1994. It is a 200-page collection of oral texts, collected in Warlpiri and provided with English translations, for which Peggy Rockman was a source as well as editor. A senior dancer amongst her people, Peggy Rockman helped choose the site for, and participated in, a major ceremony for a 1993 Australian Broadcasting Corporation documentary film, Milli Milli. The ceremony, called Wati Kutjarra (Two men) Dreaming, was performed with others including fellow artist Susie Bootja Bootja Napaltjarri. Peggy Rockman's paintings have been hung in both public and commercial gallery exhibitions, including at the Araluen Centre for Arts and Entertainment and the National Gallery of Victoria's Indigenous art exhibition \\"Paint Up Big\\". Commercial galleries showing her work have included William Mora Galleries in Melbourne. A work by Peggy Rockman, Mukaki – bush plum, was included in the 2007 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award. Her paintings are held by the Art Gallery of New Wales, and the National Gallery of Victoria.

She has painted with Papunya Tula artists' cooperative. First exhibited in 1996, her work is held in the collection of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Life Takariya was born around 1960 or 1965 in the desert near what is now Kiwirrkurra Community, Western Australia, on the Western Australia–Northern Territory border. Sources differ regarding her birth date: the Art Gallery of New South Wales indicates 1960, while expert Vivien Johnson reports two possible years, 1960 or 1965. The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians operate using a different conception of time, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events. 'Napaljarri' (in Warlpiri) or 'Napaltjarri' (in Western Desert dialects) is a skin name, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus 'Takariya' is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers. Takariya's mother was Papalya Nangala and her father was Waku Tjungurrayi, whose decision to avoid contact with Europeans was responsible for the family group not entering any established settlement until 1984. Takariya's father died not long after she was born; she has siblings including older brother Warlimpirrnga Tjapaljarri and older sister Topsy Gibson Napaljarri, also an artist. Takariya married Freddy West Tjakamarra, however they later separated and she subsequently married Richard Tjakamarra and had a daughter Tatiga.

NTM was set up on the recommendation of the National Knowledge Commission. The Ministry of Human Resource Development has designated Central Institute of Indian Languages as the nodal organization for the operationalization of NTM.http://www.ntm.org.in Origins English, the primary medium of higher education in India, remains inaccessible to even the literate majority of the country. Therefore, there is an urgent need to translate material in all fields like literary, technical, scientific and business etc. so that such material is accessible to a wide range of different language speaking population across the country. Translation, thus, is seen not just as an instrument of democratizing and secularizing knowledge, but also of empowering languages and speech communities. NTM intends to establish translation as an industry in the country. Its main objectives include generation of translation tools such as dictionaries and thesauri; development of software for translation, memory, etc.; promotion of machine translation and machine aided translation; translator education through orientation programs & courses; fellowships & grants for research projects, etc. Bringing visibility to translators and translation activities by organizing book launches for translations; instituting prizes and fellowships; organizing Regional Festivals of Translation; book exhibitions, etc. also are part of the activities of NTM. Project Advisory Committee (NTM-PAC) of NTM is the highest decision making body of NTM. It is a committee of 25 members representing various sections of the academic community, ministerial bodies and publishing houses related to translation. NTM-PAC is supported by four sub-committees in matters related to copyrights and legal matters; selecting knowledge texts; fixing rates for translators, copy editors etc.; and Grant in Aid schemes of NTM. NTM Website in 23 languages NTM is in the process of establishing itself as the clearing house of all translation related activities in the country. Interaction with the public is a requisite and NTM has developed its website (www.ntm.org.in) in 23 languages for the purpose. NTM website introduces the Mission, its objectives, beneficiaries, and structure etc. Updates on list of books selected for translation, experts consulted, announcement of translation assignments etc. are available for the public here. The Discussion Forum facilitates the users to discuss various topics like the books selected for translation in a subject, an existing translation, and terminology issues in Indian languages etc.'''' Translation & Publication of Pedagogic Material 105 titles have been approved for translations in 21 disciplines (Botany, Chemistry, Computer Science, Economics, History, Law, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, Medical Science, Philosophy, Physics, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology and Zoology) so far. To know more about the books taken up for translation, visit - www.ntm.org.in NTM Databases NTM also maintains National Register of Translators(NRT) through its website. NRT is a databank wherein translators register themselves online. NRT is a searchable directory of translators, evaluators and discipline experts with classified information on profession, experience, languages known and expertise in translation, etc. Lists of the most prescribed texts in Indian universities in various disciplines are generated out of the Knowledge Text Module, another major facet of NTM-databases. Two searchable database components have been created under it: Indian Universities Database and Knowledge Text Database. Indian Universities Database furnishes information on courses, syllabi and textbooks etc. of over 350 Union Grants Commission (UGC) accredited universities and institutions. Knowledge Text Database provides complete details of the prescribed books. When made public, this would become one of the first state initiatives to provide information about all the universities/institutions and courses which can be accessed through a single window. It would help scholars and academicians from various regions to access the latest information on courses and syllabi of any university/institution of the country. University Boards can review the course details and syllabi structure of other universities before revising their curriculum. This may help in creating parity among universities of rural and urban regions. NTM- databases, created in Microsoft SQL 2005, can contain a maximum of 2^31 objects and span multiple Operating System-level files with a maximum file size of 220 Terabyte. Control mechanisms have been incorporated to the database for concurrent access to shared data, for ensuring data integrity. NTM aims to increase the usability of the databases by making them both as web and standalone applications. Translation Tools=Basic Bilingual Dictionaries The bilingual dictionaries are modelled after the hugely popular Longman Corpus Network - based Basic English-English dictionary. Six bilingual dictionaries developed by the NTM in collaboration Pearson Education, India were launched on 10 March 2012.http://overseasindian.in/2012/mar/news/20121203-133959.shtml The dictionaries are the first publications from the NTM stable. In fact, the project had begun before the coming of NTM. Dorling Kindersley India Pvt Ltd (publishing as Pearson Education) and the Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL) had agreed to develop bilingual dictionaries in 11 languages. The work started in 2006. Later when NTM was launched in the year 2008, the lexical build activities were merged with NTM. The dictionaries are modeled on the British National Corpus based hugely popular Longman Basic English Dictionary. Following are the dictionaries that were launched:(listed alphabetically) * Longman-NTM-CIIL English English Bangla Dictionary * Longman-NTM-CIIL English English Hindi Dictionary * Longman-NTM-CIIL English English Kannada Dictionary * Longman-NTM-CIIL English English Malayalam Dictionary * Longman-NTM-CIIL English English Oriya Dictionary * Longman-NTM- CIIL English English Tamil Dictionary The dictionaries can be bought from popular online retailers like www.flipkart.com, www.homeshop18.com, www.pearson.vrvbookshop.com etc. or book sellers across the country. Work is under progress in other Indian languages - Assamese, Bodo, Dogri, Gujarati, Konkani, Maithili, Meitei, Marathi, Nepali, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Santali, Telugu, and Urdu. Bilingual e-dictionaries e-dictionaries of NTM are based on ‘Longman Advanced Bilingual Framework’(LABF). LABF Dataset will be used through the Dictionary Production System(DPS), originally developed by Longman and marketed by Ingenierie Diffusion Multimedia(IDM), France. The NTM- Longman e-dictionary deals with 338,000 words, phrases and meanings; 78,000 head entries, 5,400 encyclopaedic entries, 54,000 phrases, over 515,000 examples and 26,000 synonyms, antonyms and related words. Machine Translation An English-Kannada Machine Translation(MT) package which bids to break new ground on the MT scene in India is being developed under NTM. The main aim of this project is to automate the translation of a given English sentence into Kannada. This Package is divided into 3 main modules– Parallel Aligned Corpora, Digitization of Source Language(SL) resources and Architecture. The Architecture is divided into 8 modules and implemented using Java with Netbeans Integrated Development Environment(IDE). The front end is designed using Swings and back-end SQL. The dictionary is put into action using random access file. Since Hash tables are particularly efficient when the maximum number of entries can be predicted in advance, this technique is used to accomplish searching. Collection classes are used as data storage structures. NTM has been interacting with several teams (like C-DAC, Pune, Noida, Mumbai; LTRC, ILMT, EILMT, Anusaaraka, Shakti—all at IIIT, Hyderabad) engaged in developing Machine Translation software to explore the extent to which the MT research and NTM can interface for mutual benefit. Dictionary of Translation Studies Dictionary of Translation Studies being prepared by NTM intends to serve as a companion to students and scholars interested in and associated with the discipline of Translation Studies. It is a compilation of the technically charged terms used in the discipline. It endeavours to be a comprehensive dictionary, exhausting the technical terms used in Indian as well as western discourse of translation and also the terms used in the sub- domains of Translation Studies like Interpreting, Machine Translation, etc. Training and Certification of Translators With an aim to train and orient translators, NTM has been organising 3 weeks Intensive Training Programme – ‘Introduction to Translation’. Translation theoreticians & academicians, eminent translators, linguists and language scholars from across the country have been delivering talks on various theoretical and practical aspects of translation. All the details are available in NTM website NTM has also started piloting the methods and means of its nationwide Certification of Translators Programme. The certification module is being developed in collaboration with the National Accreditation Board for Certification Bodies (NABCB) of the Quality Council of India (QCI) along the lines of the international standards set for Personnel Certification. Training of evaluators will be a major component of the Certification of Translators Programme as a new system of grading translators will be introduced. NTM Surveys Knowledge Text Scenario Survey NTM conducted a survey with the following objectives: * To find out the availability of original and translated knowledge texts * To find whether the books suggested by discipline experts are already available in the regional languages or not, so as to avoid duplicity. * To find out whether original books written in regional languages are prescribed in the syllabi or not * To analyze the general publication scenario in regional languages, in order to formulate strategies for productive interventions by NTM * To assess the need and demand of translation of knowledge texts in regional languages 17 languages are covered in the survey and they are Assamese, Bengali, Hindi, Kannada, Konkani, Malayalam, Maithili, Meitei, Marathi, Nepali, Odia, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Santali, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu. All the finding of the survey are compiled in a report titled Regional Language Knowledge Text Scenario – An Assessment. Royalty: Industry Practice across India NTM conducted a nationwide survey so as to find out the prevalent practice among some of the major as well as regional publishers towards the payment of royalty to authors/copyright holders, translators etc. In all, NTM has gathered information from over 100 publishers, which is essential in framing NTM- policies, especially in case of turnkey projects. A detailed report titled Royalty: Industry Practice Across India has been prepared. Royalty: Lexicography in India NTM conducted a survey to study the past and present scenario of lexicographic activities in 16 Indian Languages. The languages are - Assamese, Bengali, Hindi, Kannada, Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Meitei, Marathi, Nepali, Odia, Sanskrit, Santhali, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu. A detailed report titled Lexicography in Indian Languages: a brief report has been prepared explaining the finding. Medium of Instruction & Medium of Examination (MoI & MoE) in Higher Education in India NTM has collected data from 239 Universities/Colleges etc., then categorized, analyzed and a detailed report has been prepared and compared with survey report prepared by UPSC. Data provided by UGC on MoI/MoE are also categorized, analyzed and prepared a report. Workshops and Seminars NTM has organised workshops in regional languages in different parts of the country involving discipline experts and translators to chalk out strategies for NTM translation assignments. A few seminal knowledge texts formed the focus of discussions in these workshops. NTM has been conducting workshops to assess the existing knowledge text translations in regional languages. These assessment workshops also aim to bring about collaboration between NTM and eminent scholars, writers, translators and publishers in different fields which will help in forming expert panels for its translations. NTM has also been organizing seminars on various aspects of translation with special reference to regional languages in different parts of the country. Apart from these, Translator Orientation Programmes; Publishers, Media and Translators Meet; Book Festivals; Workshops on Literary and Linguistic Terms; programmes on Classical Text and Literary Text Translation have been organized across the country by NTM. These workshops help NTM to popularize its initiatives among beneficiaries.
