Biography Charles Hadfield was born at Pietersburg, South Africa, where his New Zealand- born father was an Assistant Resident Magistrate; his mother was daughter of a Devon clergyman. Hadfield went to England in 1924 to be educated at Blundell's School, Devon, after which he went up to St Edmund Hall, Oxford. In 1936 he joined the Oxford University Press. He was invited to the home of the theatre critic and author Robert Aickman in May 1946, as were the author L Tom C Rolt and four others, the outcome of which was the formation of the Inland Waterways Association (IWA), a pressure group for the preservation and restoration of the waterways, with Aickman as chairman, Hadfield as vice- chairman and Rolt as secretary. In 1950 books about the waterways started to appear, to inform the public about their plight, with Rolt producing The Inland Waterways of England, Aickman producing Know your Waterways, and Hadfield producing Introducing Canals. Later the same year, his book British Canals appeared, which ultimately was expanded into a comprehensive series of books about canals throughout Great Britain. Hadfield parted company with the IWA in 1951, after he, Rolt and others signed a memorandum suggesting that the organisation needed to have a policy of \\"priorities\\". This did not sit well with Aickman, who felt that all waterways should be retained and rule changes were introduced to force their exclusion. Hadfield recalled: In 1946 he became the director of publications at the Central Office of Information. He was a founder member of the Railway and Canal Historical Society in 1954 and in 1960 he joined his friend David St John Thomas in setting up the publishing company David & Charles and continued publishing a stream of canal books. This extended to a study of world canals, amassing a rich store of research material now kept at the National Waterways Museum, Ellesmere Port. Between 1963 and 1966 he was a member of the British Waterways Board. He resigned from the management of the publishing firm in 1964 but continued to edit The Canals of the British Isles series. In 1971 he was invited to rejoin the IWA and became a vice-president in 1983. He married Alice Mary Miller in 1945 who died seven years before him in 1989 and they had two sons (Henry, who died an infant and Alexander who died in 2011) and a daughter (Molly). Hadfield had been appointed CMG in 1954.

The chain is wrapped around a spin-on oil filter, and the hexagonal bar is turned anticlockwise to grip and unscrew the filter. Strap-type oil-filter wrench. A ratchet is used to turn it. Strap-type oil-filter wrench. This one has a handle built in. Socket-type oil-filter wrench. It fits over the end of the filter and is turned with a ratchet. It is made of stamped steel. An oil-filter wrench is a tool for removing spin-on type oil filters. Wrench These filters are smooth, cylindrical canisters with knurling on the bottom that are difficult to grip, especially when they are oily. One common type of wrench is shown on the right. The loop of chain is placed around the filter, and the bar is turned anticlockwise by hand until the chain wraps itself tightly around the filter. A socket wrench or adjustable spanner is then used to turn the hexagonal bar further in the same direction. This increases the tension in the chain, which bites into the soft metal casing of the oil filter which helps prevent slippage. Another type uses a metal band that is attached at both ends to a handle. The looped band is placed around the filter and the handle is turned anticlockwise, which puts tension on the band, causing it to grip the filter. A third common type of wrench utilizes a metal or plastic cup that is shaped much like a socket. The cup is placed on the end of the filter, which engages the knurling. A socket or wrench is then used to loosen the filter. Volkswagen Group and BMW cars require this type of wrench to remove their filters (or the lid of the filter housing, where a non-cartridge filter is used). Finally, a \\"claw\\" type of wrench, manufactured by Sykes-Pickavanthttp://www.sykes-pickavant.com/ and others, has three geared metal prongs and accommodates a (typically) 3/8\\" ratchet driver. As the driver is turned anticlockwise the gears make the prongs clench the filter body harder. This type is very effective on tight filters and can be used in more confined spaces than a strap or chain type. K&N; has designed their oil filters so that removal and installation can be done with a 3/4\\" or 19mm socket or wrench.

It was owned by Harry Guggenheim who also raced horses in Europe. A founding member of the New York Racing Association, Guggenheim began racing in 1929 and originally raced as the Falaise Stable, the name of his Long Island, New York estate. In 1943 he renamed it the Cain Hoy Stable for his Cain Hoy Plantation, a timber and cattle plantation near Wando, South Carolina. The stable's racing colors were blue and white blocks with white sleeves and cap. In 1959, Cain Hoy Stable led all American owners in earnings. Among the jockeys who rode for Cain Hoy Stable were Henry Moreno, Manuel Ycaza and Braulio Baeza. Trainers who worked for the stable included Frank A. Bonsal, Moody Jolley, Loyd Gentry, Jr., Eddie Hayward, William W. Stephens and U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductees, Angel Penna, Sr. and Woody Stephens. Cain Hoy Stable owned the mare Anchors Aweigh, the dam of Never Bow, Make Sail, Sheet Anchor, as well as the mare Siama who was the Kentucky Broodmare of the Year in 1960 and dam of Bald Eagle, One-Eyed King, and Dead Ahead. Cain Hoy was part of a 1959 breeding syndicate that purchased Belmont Stakes winner, Cavan. The stable won numerous important graded stakes races including the Kentucky Oaks, Alabama Stakes, and Champagne Stakes on three occasions, and the then prestigious Belmont Futurity and Withers Stakes, twice. Cain Hoy had six horses won ran in the Kentucky Derby. They won the 1953 edition with Dark Star, handing the future Hall of Famer Native Dancer the only defeat of his career. Their next best Derby finish came in 1963 when Never Bend finished second. Cain Hoy bred and raced Ack Ack, the 1971 Horse of the Year and a U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee. The stable also bred American multiple stakes winner Bold Reason as well as the filly San San who was sold to Countess Margit Batthyany in France and who won the 1972 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

Upper-atmospheric lightning is believed to be electrically induced forms of luminous plasma. The preferred usage is transient luminous event (TLE), because the various types of electrical-discharge phenomena in the upper atmosphere lack several characteristics of the more familiar tropospheric lightning. Characteristics Midsummer night sprites at La Silla Observatory. There are several types of TLEs, the most common being sprites. Sprites are flashes of bright red light that occur above storm systems. C-sprites (short for ‚Äúcolumniform sprites‚Äù) is the name given to vertical columns of red light. C-sprites exhibiting tendrils are sometimes called ‚Äúcarrot sprites‚Äù. Other types of TLEs include sprite halos, ghosts, blue jets, gigantic jets, pixies, gnomes, trolls, blue starters, and ELVESs. The acronym ELVES (‚ÄúEmission of Light and Very Low Frequency perturbations due to Electromagnetic Pulse Sources‚Äù) refers to a singular event which is commonly thought of as being plural. TLEs are secondary phenomena that occur in the upper atmosphere in association with underlying thunderstorm lightning. TLEs generally last anywhere from less than a millisecond to more than 2 seconds. The first video recording of a TLE was captured accidentally on July 6, 1989 when researcher R.C Franz left a camera running overnight to view the night sky. When reviewing the video taken, two finger-like vertical images appeared in two frames of the film. The next known video recordings of a TLE were taken in 1989, when the Shuttle Mission STS-34 was conducting the Mesoscale Lightning Observation Experiment. On October 21, 1989 TLE'S were recorded during the Shuttle orbits 44 and 45. TLEs have been captured by a variety of optical recording systems, with the total number of recent recorded events (early 2009) estimated at many tens-of-thousands. The global rate of TLE occurrence has been estimated from satellite (FORMOSAT-2) observations to be several million events per year. History In the 1920s, the Scottish physicist C.T.R. Wilson predicted that electrical breakdown should occur in the atmosphere high above large thunderstorms.C. T. R. Wilson (1924) \\"The electric field of a thundercloud and some of its effects,\\" Proceedings of the Physical Society of London, 37 (1) : 32D-37D. Available on-line at: University of S√£o Paulo.Earle R. Williams (November 2001) \\"Sprites, elves, and glow discharge tubes,\\" Physics Today, 54 (11) : 41‚Äì47. Available on-line at: Physics Today . In ensuing decades, high altitude electrical discharges were reported by aircraft pilots and discounted by meteorologists until the first direct visual evidence was documented in 1989. Several years later, the optical signatures of these events were named 'sprites' by researchers to avoid inadvertently implying physical properties that were, at the time, still unknown. The terms red sprites and blue jets gained popularity after a video clip was circulated following an aircraft research campaign to study sprites in 1994. Sprites First color image of a sprite, taken from an aircraft. Sprites are large-scale electrical discharges which occur high above a thunderstorm cloud, or cumulonimbus, giving rise to a quite varied range of visual shapes. They are triggered by the discharges of positive lightning between the thundercloud and the ground. The phenomena were named after the mischievous sprite, e.g., Shakespeare's Ariel or Puck,From page 128 of: John Friedman, Out of the Blue: A History of Lightning (New York, New York: Random House, Inc., 2008): \\"Dr. Davis Sentman of the University of Alaska, one of the few scientists studying these luminous, ghostlike phenomena [i.e., sprites], named the eerie flashes of colored lights after Shakespeare's mischievous spirits of the air ‚Äî Ariel in The Tempest and Puck in \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\\" and is also an acronym for Stratospheric/mesospheric Perturbations Resulting from Intense Thunderstorm Electrification. They normally are colored reddish-orange or greenish-blue, with hanging tendrils below and arcing branches above. They can also be preceded by a reddish halo, known as a sprite halo. They often occur in clusters, lying to above the Earth's surface. Sprites have been witnessed thousands of times.Walter A. Lyons and Michey D. Schmidt (2003). P1.39 The Discovery of Red Sprites as an Opportunity For Informal Science Education. American Meteorological Society. Retrieved on February 18, 2009. Sprites have been held responsible for otherwise unexplained accidents involving high altitude vehicular operations above thunderstorms.. Jets Although jets are considered to be a type of upper-atmospheric lightning, it has been found that they are components of tropospheric lightning and a type of cloud-to-air discharge that initiates within a thunderstorm and travel upwards. In contrast, other types of TLEs are not electrically connected with tropospheric lightning‚Äîdespite being triggered by it. The two main types of jets are blue jets and gigantic jets. Blue starters are considered to be a weaker form of blue jets. Blue jets Blue jet as seen from the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Blue jets are believed to be initiated as \\"normal\\" lightning discharges between the upper positive charge region in a thundercloud and a negative \\"screening layer\\" present above this charge region. The positive end of the leader network fills the negative charge region before the negative end fills the positive charge region, and the positive leader subsequently exits the cloud and propagates upward. It was previously believed that blue jets were not directly related to lightning flashes, and that the presence of hail somehow led to their occurrence.Fractal Models of Blue Jets, Blue Starters Show Similarity, Differences to Red Sprites They are also brighter than sprites and, as implied by their name, are blue in color. The color is believed to be due to a set of blue and near-ultraviolet emission lines from neutral and ionized molecular nitrogen. They were first recorded on October 21, 1989, on a monochrome video of a thunderstorm on the horizon taken from the Space Shuttle as it passed over Australia. Blue jets occur much less frequently than sprites. By 2007, fewer than a hundred images had been obtained. The majority of these images, which include the first color imagery, are associated with a single thunderstorm. These were taken in a series of 1994 aircraft flights to study sprites.'Red Sprites & Blue Jets ‚Äì the video', 'Blue Jets & Blue Starters ‚Äì the video'. Blue starters Blue starters were discovered on video from a night time research flight around thunderstormsExamples may be seen in the clip 'Blue Jets & Blue Starters ‚Äì the video' . and appear to be \\"an upward moving luminous phenomenon closely related to blue jets.\\" They appear to be shorter and brighter than blue jets, reaching altitudes of only up to 20 km.Blue jets \\"Blue starters appear to be blue jets that never quite make it,\\" according to Dr. Victor P. Pasko, associate professor of electrical engineering.Fractal models of blue jets, blue starters show similarity, differences to red sprites Gigantic jets Gigantic jet in Oro Verde, Argentina, February 2, 2014 Where blue jets are believed to initiate between the upper positive charge region and a negative screening layer directly above this region, gigantic jets appear to initiate between the upper positive and lower negative charge regions in the thundercloud. In a similar process to how blue jets form, the higher charge region is discharged by the leader network before the same occurs in the lower charge region, and one end of the leader network propagates upward from the cloud toward the ionosphere. Gigantic jets reach higher altitudes than blue jets, and the upper portion of the jet changes color from blue to red. =Observations= On September 14, 2001, scientists at the Arecibo Observatory photographed a gigantic jet‚Äîdouble the height of those previously observed‚Äîreaching around into the atmosphere. The jet was located above a thunderstorm over an ocean, and lasted under a second. The jet was initially observed to be traveling up at around at a speed similar to typical lightning, increased to , but then split in two and sped upward with speeds of at least to the ionosphere where it then spread out in a bright burst of light. On July 22, 2002, five gigantic jets between in length were observed over the South China Sea from Taiwan, reported in Nature.Giant jets caught on camera The jets lasted under a second, with shapes likened by the researchers to giant trees and carrots. On November 10, 2012, the Chinese Science Bulletin reported a gigantic jet event observed over a thunderstorm in mainland China on August 12, 2010. \\"GJ event that was clearly recorded in eastern China (storm center located at 35.6¬∞N,119.8¬∞E, near the Huanghai Sea)\\". On February 2, 2014, the Oro Verde Observatory of Argentina reported ten or more gigantic jet events observed over a thunderstorm in Entre R√≠os south. The storm center was located at 33¬∞S, 60¬∞W, near the city of Rosario. On August 13, 2016, photographer Phebe Pan caught a clear wide-angle photo of a gigantic jet on a wide-angle lens while shooting Perseid meteors atop Shi Keng Kong peak in Guangdong province and Li Hualong captured the same jet from a more distant location in Jiahe, Hunan, China. On March 28, 2017, Photographer Jeff Miles captured four gigantic jets over Australia. On October 16, 2019, pilot Chris Holmes captured a high-resolution video of a gigantic jet from 35,000 feet above the Gulf of Mexico near the Yucat√°n Peninsula.Phillips, T. (October 25, 2019). Close encounter with a gigantic jet. Retrieved from https://spaceweatherarchive.com/2019/10/25/close-encounter-with-a-gigantic- jet/ From 35 miles, Holmes's video shows a blue streamer reach up from the top of a thunderstorm to the ionosphere, becoming red at the top. Only then does a brilliant white lightning leader crawl slowly from the top of the cloud, reaching about 10% of the height of the gigantic jet before fading. ELVES ELVES (Emission of Light and Very Low Frequency perturbations due to Electromagnetic Pulse Sources) often appear as a dim, flattened, expanding glow around in diameter that lasts for, typically, just one millisecond.ELVES, a primer: Ionospheric Heating By the Electromagnetic Pulses from Lightning They occur in the ionosphere above the ground over thunderstorms. Their color was a puzzle for some time, but is now believed to be a red hue. ELVES were first recorded on another shuttle mission, this time recorded off French Guiana on October 7, 1990. That ELVES was discovered in the Shuttle Video by the Mesoscale Lightning Experiment (MLE) team at Marshall Space Flight Center, AL led by the Principal Investigator, Otha H.\\"Skeet\\" Vaughan, Jr. ELVES is a whimsical acronym for Emissions of Light and Very Low Frequency Perturbations due to Electromagnetic Pulse Sources.The Free Dictionary ‚Äì ELVES This refers to the process by which the light is generated; the excitation of nitrogen molecules due to electron collisions (the electrons possibly having been energized by the electromagnetic pulse caused by a discharge from an underlying thunderstorm).  Trolls, Pixies, Ghosts, and Gnomes = Trolls  TROLLs, (Transient Red Optical Luminous Lineaments) occur after strong sprites, and appear as red spots with faint tails, and on higher-speed cameras, appear as a rapid series of events, starting as a red glow that forms after a sprite tendril, that later produces a red streak downward from itself. They are similar to jets.  Pixies  Pixies were first observed during the STEPS program during the summer of 2000, a multi-organizational field program investigating the electrical characteristics over thunderstorms on the High Plains. A series of unusual, white luminous events atop the thunderstorm were observed over a 20-minute period, lasting for an average of 16 milliseconds each. They were later dubbed 'pixies'. They are less than 100 meters across. They are not related to lightning.  Ghosts  Ghosts (Green emissions from excited Oxygen in Sprite Tops) are faint, green glows that appear after red sprites, fading away in milliseconds. They were first observed in 2019 by professional storm chaser Pecos Hank. No scientific journals exist on these phenomena yet due to their recent discovery, but they have been observed on footage. Their green glow has been hypothesized by its observers to come from excited oxygen atoms, much as how auroras appear green, however, this is unconfirmed.  Gnomes  Gnomes are small, brief spikes of light that point upward from a thunderstorm cloud's anvil top, caused as strong updrafts push moist air above the anvil. They last for only a few microseconds. They are about 200 meters wide, and have a maximum of 1 kilometer in height. Their color is unknown as they have only been observed in black-and-white footage.

Retained firefighters are employed and trained by the local fire and rescue service. When required to answer an emergency call, retained firefighters are summoned to the fire station by a radio pager (also known as an \\"alerter\\"). Once at the station, the crews staff the fire engine and proceed to the incident. Retained firefighters are therefore required to live or work near to the fire station they serve. This allows them to respond to emergencies within acceptable and strict attendance time targets set out by each fire service. Typically, retained firefighters are employed in rural areas or in large villages or small towns. They provide cover to 90% of the area of the UK - there are 14,000 in England and Wales. Of the approximately 8,500 operational firefighters in Scotland, about 32% are retained.Scottish Executive: Retained firefighterd in the Scottish fire service (accessed 23 Apr 07) London Fire Brigade, West Midlands Fire ServiceThe future of Sedgley Fire Station, which was an RDS station, is yet to be decided, but it is currently non- operational., Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service and Guernsey Fire and Rescue Service are the only four fire and rescue services in the British Islands that do not have any retained firefighters.Department for Communities and Local Government: Fire & Resilience - Retained Duty System p56, sec 5.22(accessed 23 April 07) Unlike volunteer firefighters, retained firefighters are paid. They are paid an annual \\"retainer fee\\" for being on call and receive further pay for each emergency call they respond to. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) and the Retained Firefighters' Union (RFU) represent the interests of retained firefighters across the country. Emergency response Retained firefighters were traditionally called \\"part-time firefighters\\". However this term is now widely acknowledged as inaccurate as retained staff usually have to be on call for over 60 hours a week. The exact times a retained firefighter spends on call depends on their job and other personal circumstances. Wholetime firefighters do not usually respond to emergencies during the time when they are off duty, unless there are under dual contract arrangements. Generally, wholetimeODPM: The Fire & Rescue Service Retained Duty System - A review of recruitment and retention challenges, pub TSO, Feb 2005 (see Part 1 Terminology) or full-time firefighters do not respond to calls when they are off-duty as they are assigned to a watch on permanent shifts. However, most retained firefighters can only provide cover at set times due to their full-time employment commitments. For example, it may be that some personnel can provide cover during the day in any given week or only evenings and weekends per week. Often it is a mixture of both. In Ireland, some on-call firefighters were summoned by means of an air raid-type siren mounted on the local fire station. Now they are all on a pager system, either controlled locally in the case of Cork and Dublin, or by a regional control centre (CAMP) in the rest of the country. Unlike many volunteer firefighters in the United States, retained firefighters are not permitted to use blue lights or sirens on their personal vehicles. When they drive to the fire station, they must obey normal road traffic laws at all times whilst en route. The British Government reviewed the situation in 2008, but decided that to give every retained firefighter a blue light would effectively \\"dilute\\" the importance of blue lights. Most importantly, use of blue lights by retained staff may cause confusion for local road users, particularly where multiple vehicles would be responding to a particular fire station from several directions at once. Role within the community In the UK, retained firefighters are responsible for undertaking community fire safety work alongside their full-time colleagues. This involves talks to local school children, home safety checks, and fitting of free smoke detectors in homes. Some RDS fire stations receive hundreds of call-outs per year, comparable or sometimes greater than some full-time fire stations. Other RDS stations receive a relatively small number of call-outs. Some fire and rescue services employ a system known as \\"day manning\\" or \\"day staffing\\", where the fire station is operated by a full-time watch during the day and covered by retained firefighters at night. Training and competency Whole-time firefighters attend training school for an initial period of 13‚Äì20 weeks, depending on the fire and rescue service they have joined. On-call firefighters now undertake the same training modules as full-time recruits, spread over a greater period of time due to full-time employment job commitments. The new National Firefighter Training Syllabus is now widely- adopted and consists of a three-week \\"core skills\\" module, a two-week breathing apparatus module, a one-week HAZMAT module, a one-week road traffic collision module, plus several weekend trauma care/EMT and first aid courses. On completion of this, firefighters then enter an on station development stage over a three-year period, once they have completed their development stage they then become competent and receive a higher level of pay. The modules are also backed up by ongoing training on station in multi-disciplined roles, procedures and equipment. However, many Fire Services do not allow retained firefighters to transfer directly to wholetime firefighter without completing a full 13-week new recruits course. In December 2003, recognising the need for a review of the retained duty system, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the department responsible for fire and resilience at that time, called for a report. Published in February 2005, it noted: > \\"The system of flexible local fire cover needs to attract a new pool of > applicants who would not have considered the opportunity previously. The > recruitment problems stem in part from the level of pay, the lack of a > pension, the lack of development opportunities and the often inflexible > availability system.\\"ODPM: The Fire & Rescue Service Retained Duty System - > A review of recruitment and retention challenges, pub TSO, Feb 2005 (see > Introduction) Other duties As well as responding to emergency calls and undertaking community fire safety initiatives, retained firefighters attend weekly training nights (aka \\"Drill Nights\\") of two to three hours per week to maintain competency levels. They must also undertake routine checks on their equipment and fire appliance, as well as test, clean and maintain the equipment to ensure it will work properly when required during an emergency. To allow retained firefighters to boost their earnings, some retained stations are involved in co-responder schemes, whereby fire crews act as first responders providing first aid prior to the attendance of paramedics.

It is played in Nepal, Rajasthan (India), and Thailand. England and Scotland regularly field teams. Equipment consists of a standard polo ball and six to ten foot cane (similar to bamboo) sticks with a polo mallet head on the end. The pitch is three-quarters of the length of a standard polo pitch, due to the lower speed of the elephants. Two people ride each elephant; the elephants are steered by mahouts, while the player tells the mahout which way to go and hits the ball. Elephant polo originated in Meghauli, Nepal. Tiger Tops in Nepal remains the headquarters of elephant polo and the site of the World Elephant Polo Championships. Elephant Polo in Nepal and Thailand is played under the auspices of the World Elephant Polo Association. WEPA enforces strict rules regarding elephant welfare and game play. Other tournaments, such as those played in India and Sri Lanka, are managed independently of each other and the World Elephant Polo Association. Sri Lanka held an annual tournament in Galle under the auspices of the Ceylon Elephant Polo Association. In 2007 an elephant went on a rampage during a game, injuring two players and destroying the Spanish team's minibus. Allegations of cruel treatment of polo elephants, made by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, have led to match cancellation, sponsorship withdrawal and the removal of references to elephant polo records in the Guinness Book of World Records. The Thailand Elephant Polo Association announced in October 2018 that it will end polo matches in Thailand. A polo tournament had been held annually at Anantara Hotel Bangkok owned by Minor Hotels.

A Puritan clergyman, Field desired to change the Act of Uniformity 1558 in order to remove aspects of Roman Catholicism that he found unacceptable. A View of Popish Abuses was designed to sway public opinion towards his view. Contents Field's main complaints concerned the church services that took place. According to his publication: * There was little or no discipline in services and parishioners frequently paid little attention, spoke amongst themselves, ate or slept during the liturgy. * Congregations were required to kneel at the name of Jesus, which caused lots of noise that obscured the next sentence of the passage being read. This kneeling was not required at the name of God, which Field found blasphemous. * The 'preaching' in the service was most frequently simply reading, and was carried out as fast as possible. Field accused priests of doing this in order to indulge in \\"games of Sodom\\" in the afternoon. * Field, who believed education was vital, was mortified that the majority of congregations were ignorant of much of the Bible and thought the Gospels more important than the Old Testament. * He attacked cathedrals, labeling them \\"popish dens\\". Publication and aftermath Field's book was published abroad with Thomas Wilcox's Admonition to the Parliament. Both Wilcox and Field were sentenced to a year's imprisonment in the Tower of London for the publication and breaking the Act of Uniformity 1558. Field was undeterred and continued to push for greater emphasis on preaching and the removal of Roman Catholic tendencies in the Church of England. It is likely that he penned at least some of the Marprelate Tracts of 1588.

Inaros (II), also known as Inarus, (fl. ca. 460 BCE) was an Egyptian rebel ruler who was the son of a Libyan prince named Psamtik, presumably of the old Saite line, and grandson of Psamtik III. In 460 BC, he revolted against the Persians with the help of his Athenian allies under Admiral Charitimides, and defeated the Persian army commanded by satrap Achaemenes in 460 BCE. The Persians retreated to Memphis, but the Athenians were finally defeated in 454 BC by the Persian army led by Megabyzus, satrap of Syria, and Artabazus, satrap of Phrygia, after a two-year siege. Inaros was captured and carried away to Susa where he was reportedly crucified in 454 BC. Revolt and aftermath He held a kingship over the Libyans from Mareia (above Pharos) and the part of the Nile Delta around Sais. With help from Amyrtaeus, also from Sais, who took the northern marshes, Inarus drove out the tax-collectors and collected mercenaries, thus starting a revolt in Egypt during the reign of King Artaxerxes I of Persia, following the assassination of king Xerxes I. The Athenian allies from whom he was paid 100 triers, sent troops and an army of more than 200 ships led by Charitimides to aid him in 460 BC.  Battle of Pampremis (460 BC)  Libyan soldier, circa 470 BCE. Xerxes I tomb relief. Diodorus tells us that once the Athenians had arrived, they and the Egyptians accepted battle from the Persians. The rebel army confronted the Persian army of around 400,000 infantry and eighty ships led by the brother of Artaxerxes, the satrap Achaemenes. At first the Persians' superior numbers gave them the advantage, but eventually the Athenians broke through the Persian line, whereupon the Persian army routed and fled. Some portion of the Persian army found refuge in the citadel of Memphis (called the 'White Castle'), however, and could not be dislodged.Diodorus XI, 74 Thucydides's rather compressed version of these events is: \\"and making themselves masters of the river and two-thirds of Memphis, addressed themselves to the attack of the remaining third, which is called White Castle\\".Thucydides I, 104 The satrap Achaemenes, together with 100,000 of his 400,000 men was defeated and killed at Pampremis and the Persians retreated to Memphis. The commanders of the Athenian fleet, Charitimides and Cimon fought a naval battle with the Persians, in which forty Greek ships engaged fifty Persians ships, of which twenty were captured with their crews, and the remaining thirty sunk. To show that their victory was complete, the rebels sent the dead body of satrap Achaemenes to the Persian king.  Siege of Memphis (459-455 BCE)  Egyptian soldier, circa 470 BCE. Xerxes I tomb relief. The Athenians and Egyptians thus settled down to besiege the White Castle. The siege evidently did not progress well, and probably lasted for at least four years, since Thucydides says that their whole expedition lasted 6 years,Thucydides I, 110 and of this time the final 18 months was occupied with the Siege of Prosoptis.Thucydides I, 109 According to Thucydides, at first Artaxerxes sent Megabazus to try and bribe the Spartans into invading Attica, to draw off the Athenian forces from Egypt. When this failed, he instead assembled a large army under (confusingly) Megabyzus, and dispatched it to Egypt. Diodorus has more or less the same story, with more detail; after the attempt at bribery failed, Artaxerxes put Megabyzus and Artabazus in charge of 300,000 men, with instructions to quell the revolt. They went first from Persia to Cilicia and gathered a fleet of 300 triremes from the Cilicians, Phoenicians and Cypriots, and spent a year training their men. Then they finally headed to Egypt.Diodorus XI, 74-75 Modern estimates, however, place the number of Persian troops at the considerably lower figure of 25,000 men given that it would have been highly impractical to deprive the already strained satrapies of any more man power than that. Thucydides does not mention Artabazus, who is reported by Herodotus to have taken part in the second Persian invasion; Diodorus may be mistaken about his presence in this campaign.Herodotus VIII, 126 It is clearly possible that the Persian forces did spend some prolonged time in training, since it took four years for them to respond to the Egyptian victory at Pampremis. Although neither author gives many details, it is clear that when Megabyzus finally arrived in Egypt, he was able to quickly lift the Siege of Memphis, defeating the Egyptians in battle, and driving the Athenians from Memphis.Diodorus XI, 77  Siege of Prosopitis (455 BCE)  Portrait of Inarus with his Pharaoh crown (detail). The Athenians now fell back to the island of Prosopitis in the Nile delta, where their ships were moored. There, Megabyzus laid siege to them for 18 months, until finally he was able to drain the river from around the island by digging canals, thus \\"joining the island to the mainland\\". In Thucydides's account the Persians then crossed over to the former island, and captured it. Only a few of the Athenian force, marching through Libya to Cyrene survived to return to Athens. In Diodorus's version, however, the draining of the river prompted the Egyptians (whom Thucydides does not mention) to defect and surrender to the Persians. The Persians, not wanting to sustain heavy casualties in attacking the Athenians, instead allowed them to depart freely to Cyrene, whence they returned to Athens. Since the defeat of the Egyptian expedition caused a genuine panic in Athens, including the relocation of the Delian treasury to Athens, Thucydides's version is probably more likely to be correct.Holland, p. 363.  Battle of Mendesium  As a final disastrous coda to the expedition, Thucydides mentions the fate of a squadron of fifty triremes sent to relieve the Siege of Prosopitis. Unaware that the Athenians had finally succumbed, the fleet put in at the Mendesian mouth of the Nile, where it was promptly attacked from the land, and from the sea by the Phoenician navy. Most of the ships were destroyed, with only a handful managing to escape and return to Athens. Total Athenian casualties of the expedition totaled some 50,000 men and 250 ships.  Retreat to Byblos and capture  Inarus and possible Greek generals as prisoners, seized by Artaxerxes I. Charitimides was killed in battle and Inarus was wounded in the thigh by the Persian force and retreated to Byblos, his stronghold and the only Egyptian city that did not submit to Megabyzus. After fighting for a year and a half in the marshes, Inaros was defeated by Megabyzus. Together with the remaining Greeks, he was taken captive away to Susa. Execution Megabyzus promised Inaros and his rebel Greeks that they would not be executed once they arrived at Susa. The Queen wanted them punished and killed because they were responsible for the death of her son, the satrap Achaemenes, and asked for his death. Artaxerxes I initially kept this promise, but after five years of pleading handed Inaros and fifty Greeks to Queen Mother Amestris. There are two versions of his death. According to the first he was crucified, and according to the other, impaled. A fragment of Ctesias preserved by Photios I of Constantinople reports that \\"Inaros was executed on three stakes, fifty of the Greeks, all that she could lay hands on, were decapitated.\\"Photius' excerpt of Ctesias' Persica (¬ß 14.37-39) https://www.livius.org/ct- cz/ctesias/photius_persica2.html The Greek word anestaurothe, used to describe and name the method of his execution in the texts could either mean impalement or crucifixion on a single stake, or crucifixion on a true cross, but there is not enough evidence and information in the historical records to give a definitive answer. Thucydides reports a slightly different story. He records no truces and Professor J M Bigwood argues that Thucydides should be interpreted as saying that Inaros was both captured and executed in the same year, 454 BC. Legacy His revolt, although unsuccessful in the end, left a big mark in Egyptian history. Herodotus also reports that Inaros did more damage to the Persians than any man before him. Inaros I and II Inaros II is often confused in both ancient and modern literature with his namesake, the Libyan prince Inaros I of Athribis, who rebelled against the Assyrians about two centuries earlier.Ryholt, K.

She is the former wife of ƒêole √êogani (married 1986, divorced 2001) and also a former member of the ƒêogani duo. She gave birth to two of ƒêole's four children.  Music career = Career beginnings (1992-2000)  From 1992 until 2001, she was the female of the dance duo ƒêogani. They were considered as one of the most famous dance entertainers in the Serbian musical industry. In the year 2001 Deliba≈°iƒá divorced her husband of 15 years, leaving the duo and embarking on a solo career. A few months later, Deliba≈°iƒá place was eventually filled in by Vesna Triviƒá who eventually became ƒêole's second wife.  Solo career (2001-2003)  In 2001, she released her first solo album, called \\"≈†esto ƒçulo\\" (Sixth sense), and it was a successful comeback. Songs \\"Neƒáu da slu≈°am la≈æi\\", \\"≈Ωene\\", \\"Daj\\" i \\"Moƒánica\\" became instant hits. In 2002, she released her second album \\"Kraljica ritma/Slaƒëa zauvek\\" (Queen of the rhythm/Slaƒëa forever). It was a more successful album then the former. Songs included in the album include \\"Svake noƒái\\", \\"Izaƒëi\\", \\"Pusti me\\", \\"Na odreƒëeno\\" shortly after became hits. \\"Kraljica ritma\\" song was one of the most successful singles of all time in the Serbian dance music industry.  Album fiasco (2004-2005)  In 2004, she released a new album called \\"Nekad i sad\\" (Then and Now). It later approved as a fiasco in all ways, making only one song possible hit. \\"Dupla doza\\" was a Latino rhythm song. The fiasco is mainly considered to be a collateral damage of her and ƒêole \\"media war\\", and bad promotion of the album.  Club hits (2006-2008)  In late 2006, it was confirmed that Slaƒëa was in studio, and recordings for the new album are being taken. Later, it was announced that album will be named \\"Ba≈° to...\\" (Exactly that...). On 14.02.2007, promotion was done in one of the famous Belgrade clubs. Just a few days later, it was obvious that the \\"Ba≈° to...\\" album will be one of the most successful albums that year. The first single was \\"Don perinjon (Poznata, viƒëena, slavna)\\" (Don Perignon - Famous, seen, popular). It was a megahit contributing a fairly anonymous DJ MIjat (Dj Miat). Second single was \\"Sedmi sprat\\" (Seventh floor). It instantly became the biggest clubbing megahit of all time. Lyrics \\"Sedmi sprat i mrak u stanu, znam da ima≈° to u planu, da mi poka≈æe≈° koliko si jak...ba≈° se vidi da si lak\\" (Floor seven, it's dark in your apartment, I know what you have on your mind, you want to show me how strong you are....you are so easy...) are accepted as a sort of a hymn to the clubbing, outgoing persons. Third single was \\"Slaki\\", an uptempo Latino-Greek style summer hit. It was the most famous for extensive use of autotune and vocoder effect. Fourth single was track number 6. - \\"Hipnoza\\" (Hypnose). It was, also like the previous singles, a hit in the clubs. Last single from that album was \\"Made in Srbija\\" (Made in Serbia). It is a Serbian version of the US hit \\"Wild 2Night\\" by Shaggy & Olivia. The album \\"Ba≈° to...\\" was promoted in Europe, US and Australia club tours that lasted until late 2008. It is estimated that some 700,000 people participated the club shows.  2009-present  In September 2009, in a night show on \\"BN\\" television in Bijeljina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, she confirmed that recordings have been done for the upcoming new album (TBA). Two weeks later, song \\"Neka gore dlanovi\\" (Let the palms burn of desire) was leaked on the radio programme and internet portal \\"Folkoteka\\". Two days later, in another show on \\"PINK\\" television, she premiered her three new songs \\"Bilderu\\" (Bodybuilder), \\"Hit u gradu\\" (City club mega-hit), also including \\"Neka gore dlanovi\\". These songs instantly became hits, promising the very successful album. On December 31, 2009, Slaƒëa announced that her new album will be named \\"Pet\\" (Five), symbolically meaning fifth decade of her life, fifth solo album, and also best note in the school (In Serbian schools 5=A grade). She also confirmed that she is in a happy relationship with one man, later paparazzi found out that it is certain Igor. In January 2010, she was a guest in the new album of her former husband and his new wife, today's duo \\"ƒêogani\\". She participated in the song \\"Hajmo sad u provod...\\", (Let's party me and you..). This song was a shock for Balkan publicity, most probably for the new video, in which Slaƒëa and Vesna (former enemies) are singing about their (former) husband ƒêole being a sex- maniac, and her being lied to, \\"ƒêole cheating Slaƒëa with Vesna, and then Vesna with Slaƒëa\\". The video is full of (by some) erotic dance. On June 1, 2010, in an interview for \\"Svet\\" tabloid, ƒêole ƒêogani confirmed that on new tour for ƒêogani duo, Slaƒëa is going to be a partner, so many of the shows will be combined with Slaƒëa's promotion of her upcoming album \\"Pet\\". In June 2010. Slaƒëa recorded new song \\"Dizel Power\\" with Shwarz.  Personal life  She is the former wife of ƒêole √êogani (married 1986, divorced 2001) and also a former member of the ƒêogani duo. She gave birth to two of ƒêole's three children. She is born as blonde, but has become brunette at more times (at first time in 1991).

In 1919 he was captain of the school athletics team, played handball to championship level and was a valuable team member in the senior football squad. In 1920 he was voted Captain of the College and achieved Dux of College.

Brew eventually gained a Bachelor of Law but never let the sporting side of his life fade away. At the end of 1922 he finished a season as captain of the junior C.W.M.S. league team of West Melbourne and shortly after made his debut for the Carlton Football Club in Round 3 of the 1923 season. In 1931 Brew was made a Life Member of the Carlton Football club in 1931 however ongoing problems with injury made his role increasingly difficult. He formally retired from the game early in 1932 due to a knee injury which occurred towards the end of the previous season. During the Second World War he served with the Australian Army, rising to the rank of Captain by 1945. In 1943 he was married in South Australia while stationed there during the war. His interest in horse racing increased and by the 1960s it was taking up a larger part of his time as both an owner and trainer.

The film was released on 3 March 1934 and is the first talkie film in Kannada language.Dr.Raj's impact on Kannada cinema Rediff.com It is also the first film to be screened in the erstwhile Mysore Kingdom. It is a lost film. Though initially it was believed that the movie had 18 songs, a gramophone record jacket found in private archives showed that the movie had as many as 30 songs belying the notion that the first four Kannada talkie movies had no recorded sound tracks.https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/an-attempt-to- retell-history-of-kannadas-first-talkie/article26421496.ece Plot Sati Sulochana is based on the character Sulochana from the Ramayana. She is the wife of Indrajit and the daughter-in-law of Ravana, the demon-king in Ramayana. The film tries to portray the goings-on of the war between the Hindu god Rama and Ravana as seen from the point of view of Sulochana. Ravana abducts Rama's wife Sita to his kingdom of Lanka, drawing Rama into a war. In the course of the war, Rama's brother Lakshmana is knocked unconscious by an arrow from Indrajit and is revived by a medicinal herb called Sanjeevani. The revived Lakshmana kills Indrajit and makes Sulochana a widow. Ravana's defeat by Lord Rama and the killing of Indrajit is viewed through the eyes of Sulochana. Unable to bear the pain of husband's death, Sulochana commits sati sacrifice. Cast * Subbaiah Naidu as Indrajit * Tripuramba as Sulochana * R. Nagendra Rao as Ravana * Lakshmi Bai as Mandodari * Y.

Padmadevi as Sakhi * Indubala Background The producer of the film was a Marwari businessman from Bangalore (a native of Ahore, Jalore District of Rajasthan) named Shah Chamanlal Doongaji, who started a film production company in Bangalore called South India Movietone in 1932. He decided to make a mythological movie called Sati Sulochana involving characters from the Ramayana like Ravana, Ravana's son Indrajit, Ravana's wife Mandodari and Indrajit's wife Sulochana. He engaged Yaragudipati Varada Rao to direct the film as well as play a character of Lakshmana, Bellave Narahari Shastri to write the screenplay, dialogues and lyrics. Nagendra Rao, who had previous exposure to films, was selected to play the role of Ravana and was given an additional role of production management. M. V. Subbaiah Naidu was selected to play the lead role of Indrajit and two ladies; Lakshmi Bai and Tripuramba were selected to play the roles of Mandodari and Sulochana respectively. Production Sachin Nayaka chose to shoot the film at Chatrapathi Studio in Kolhapur. The production was started in December 1933 and took 2 months to complete. Shooting was entirely done in natural sunlight and by man-made reflectors. The camera assistants carried mirrors on their shoulders to project light onto the set to provide back lighting. They had to keep moving mirrors in alignement with the moving sun. The sets were not having ceiling but they were covered with white cloth. Also, there was no glycerine at that time. Some water drops were sprayed near to the eyes of actress to pass them off as tears. The total amount spent for production was 40,000. The film involved shooting a war scene and this was done using 2 cameras. The film was released on 3 March 1934 at Paramount cinema theatre (later called as Parimala talkies) near the City Market of Bangalore. The length of the film was 173 minutes. Being the first Kannada talkie film, it ran house-full at Bangalore for six weeks.

Once the flagship of the range, the 1000S was MZ's largest-ever displacement motorcycle, and their first multi-cylinder bike since 1959. The MZ 1000S was the most powerful production inline twin cylinder engine worldwide.  Company history  In the Communist era, the East German firm MZ Motorrad produced only single-cylinder, small-displacement motorcycles. These were mostly rugged 2-stroke commuters, from which MZ developed successful 250 cc ISDT machines. MZ were then world leaders in 2-stroke design, but chief engineer and rider Ernst Degner defected to the West, selling MZ technical know-how to Suzuki. Degner's defection After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, MZ had access to Western designers and resources, and they hoped to move into a more sophisticated market. In 1994 the factory produced the Skorpion range. Conceived by British design firm Seymour Powell, it used a 660 cc Yamaha single-cylinder engine. The Skorpion was followed in 2001 by the Baghira motard, which also used the Yamaha engine. Later, after being taken over by Hong Leong Group of Malaysia, MZ began a project to produce its own 1000cc superbike, but MZ stopped all production in 2013.  Development history  The 1000S \\"New Edge\\" design was drawn by Peter Naumann who designed the F-117 Stealth Fighter, and the 1000S won a silver medal from International Design Forum. Initial reports were that this would have a V-twin engine, but MZ eventually opted for a parallel-twin instead with a 180¬∞ crank. Motorcycle News October 2002 The frame is a twin-spar design, not unlike that of the Aprilia Falco; but whereas the Falco has an alloy frame, the MZ used chrome- moly steel. The prototype model of the 1000S was previewed during Intermot 2000 in Germany and went into production in 2003. The bike initially sold well, particularly in Germany. MZ, who had grand plans to become a major world manufacturer, went on to produce some variants of the 1000S such as the MZ 1000SF naked bike and MZ 1000ST sports touring bike. Financial troubles set in and the MZ factory was closed. Model range=MZ 1000S Although the S model is a sport bike with clip-ons and rear-set footrests, the bike is nevertheless comfortable and capable of touring with a pillion passenger. Its engine is a liquid-cooled 999 cc DOHC 8-valve 4-stroke 40¬∞ inclined parallel twin with a 180¬∞ crankshaft, and a balance shaft.MZ 1000S Spares Catalogue It has electronic fuel injection, and wet-sump lubrication. It has Nissin brakes, Marzocchi male-slider forks, and an alloy cantilever swingarm rear suspension. Although the engine is compact, the bike is fairly heavy at 208 kg (dry). MZ 1000ST The ST is a milder sports-tourer motorcycle based on the \\"S\\". The engine is detuned for more torque but still produces . Compared to the \\"S\\", the ST is modified for touring comfort, with higher handlebars and lower footrests to provide a roomier seating position for long distance riding. The screen is 30 mm higher for better wind protection. A plusher rear seat provides more comfort for the pillion. The ST's engine has altered clutch springs to reduce the effort required to operate the clutch. hard luggage may be fitted, and a steering damper keeps the bike stable when fully loaded. MZ 1000SF S & SF bikes together  MZ 1000SF  The SF \\"SuperFighter\\" is a naked streetfighter, using the same engine as the ST. Reception The MZ 1000 was quite well received, although MCN journalists thought it rather expensive and \\"poor value\\". MCN damned the bike with faint praise, saying: \\"But as the Yamaha TRX850 demonstrated, many bikers aren't especially keen on parallel twins...\\" and \\"MZ is trying something different with its parallel twin 1000S and Streetfighter, but it lacks the X factor and doesn't have the kind of dealer/distributor back-up you need when buying a slightly oddball motorbike.\\" However, in a four-bike comparison test in 2005 between the Honda Firestorm, Ducati 1000SS, Suzuki SV1000, Fast Bikes magazine declared the MZ 1000S the clear winner, saying: \\"It combines the uniqueness and style of the Italian, with the usability and build quality of the Japanese, and to top it all off is far more fun to ride than any of them.\\"Fast Bikes January 2005 page 57 Motorcyclist praised the bike saying: \\"The MZ 1000 is a well-engineered, capable machine that is built to last...\\" ReferencesExternal links * MZ Motorrad Germany * Visordown review * Motorcycle News review * Motorbikes Today review * Motorcycle USA review 2004 * Motorcycle USA review 2005 1 Category:Motorcycles introduced in 2004 Category:Sport bikes Category:Sport touring motorcycles Category:Motorcycles powered by straight-twin engines ","title":"MZ 1000S"},{"id":"10813795","text":"The Ministry of Culture is the Indian government ministry charged with preservation and promotion of art and culture of India. .

Francis was arrested in November 1583 and executed in July 1584. Objectives Henry I, Duke of Guise The plot aimed to free Mary, Queen of Scots, under house arrest in England since 1568, make her queen in place of Elizabeth and legally restore Roman Catholicism. That would be achieved by a Spanish-backed invasion of England, led by the French Duke of Guise, supported by a simultaneous revolt of English Roman Catholics. Guise would marry Mary and become king. Guise was head of the Catholic League, a key participant in the French Wars of Religion. As one of those who planned the 1572 Bartholomew's Day massacre, he was loathed by Protestants throughout Europe and perhaps the least likely candidate for such an undertaking.Stuart Carroll, Martyrs and Murderers:The Guise Family and the Making of Europe, (Oxford University Press, 2011), 187. It was typical of the amateurish and overly optimistic approach of many such attempts; Throckmorton was placed under surveillance almost as soon as he returned to England, and the plot never put into action. Events Mary, Queen of Scots, ca 1578 Francis Throckmorton (1554-1584) came from a prominent English Catholic family, his father John Throckmorton being a senior judge and witness to Queen Mary's will. While travelling in Europe with his brother Thomas from 1580 to 1583, they visited Paris and met with Catholic exiles Charles Paget and Thomas Morgan. Both were agents for Mary, Queen of Scots and also involved in the 1586 Babington Plot. After returning to London in 1583, Francis carried messages between Mary, Morgan and Bernardino de Mendoza, Philip II of Spain's ambassador in London. Correspondence was routed through the French embassy in London and an agent within the embassy notified Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's Secretary of State. Throckmorton was taken into custody in November, along with incriminating documents, including lists of English Catholic supporters. Shortly before his arrest, Francis managed to send a casket of other documents to Mendoza; it has been suggested this was exactly what Walsingham wanted him to do. Francis was a relatively minor player, whose significance was to confirming the extent of Spanish involvement in seeking to overthrow Elizabeth. Protected by diplomatic immunity, Mendoza was expelled in January 1584; he was the last Spanish ambassador to England during the Elizabethan era. After being tortured to ensure he had revealed as much information as possible, Throckmorton was executed in July 1584. His brother Thomas and many others managed to escape; some were imprisoned in the Tower of London but Francis was the only one executed. Aftermath Mary was placed under strict confinement at Chartley Hall in Staffordshire, while Walsingham and Lord Burghley drew up the Bond of Association, obliging all signatories to execute anyone who attempted to usurp the throne or to assassinate the Queen. Mary herself was one of the signatories and it provided the basis for her execution following the 1586 Babington Plot. Many participants in the Babington and Gunpowder Plots were related by blood or marriage to Francis, among them Robert Catesby and Francis Tresham. Bess Throckmorton (1565-1647) secretly married Sir Walter Raleigh (1554-1618).

Most Christian adherents come from the Bantu ethnic minority group,A study on minorities in Somalia or are descended from Italian colonists and belong to the Evangelical and Wesleyan Church of the Nazarene. There is one Catholic diocese for the entire country, the Diocese of Mogadishu. Overview The Mogadishu Cathedral The Diocese of Mogadishu estimates that there were about 100 Roman Catholic practitioners in Somalia in 2004. This was down from a high of 8,500 adherents at the start of the trusteeship period in 1950, under the Prefecture Apostolic of Benadir of the Vicariate Apostolic of Mogadiscio. Thirty-seven years earlier, in 1913, during the early part of the colonial era, there were virtually no Christians in the Somali territories. Around 100‚Äì200 followers existed in the schools and orphanages of the few Catholic missions in the British Somaliland protectorate.Charles George Herbermann, The Catholic encyclopedia: an international work of reference on the constitution, doctrine, discipline, and history of the Catholic church, Volume 14, (Robert Appleton company: 1913), p.139. No Catholic missions are known to have existed in Italian Somaliland during the same period.Charles Henry Robinson, History of Christian Missions, (Read BOoks: 2007), p. 356. However, after World War I Catholicism started to be promoted in \\"Somalia italiana\\", as Listowel wrote: In 1928, a Catholic cathedral was built in Mogadishu by order of Cesare Maria De Vecchi, a Catholic governor of \\"Somalia italiana\\" who promoted the \\"Missionari della Consolata\\" Christianization of Somali people.The Catholic missionaries of \\"Consolata\\" promoted by governor De Vecchi (in Italian) The cathedral, the biggest in Africa in the 1920s and 1930s, was later damaged during the civil war that began in the 1980s. The Bishop of Mogadishu, Franco Filippini, declared in 1940 that there were about 40,000 Somali Catholics due to the work of missionaries in the rural regions of Juba and Shebelle, but World War II damaged in an irreversible way most of the Catholic missions in Italian Somalia.Tripodi, Paolo. The Colonial Legacy in Somalia. p. 66 Most were Somali Bantu,Photo of Somali Bantu with a Missionary of the \\"Consolata\\" in 1937 but some thousands were illegitimate sons of Italian soldiers and Somalian girls (who received Italian citizenship when baptized). The Bible was first translated into Somali only in 1979. According to the World Christian Encyclopedia, the Somalia Believers Fellowship, the Somalia Mennonite Mission and the Seventh-day Adventists are present in this country.World Christian Encyclopedia, (2nd edition), Volume 1, p. 673 Somalia is included in the Episcopal Area of the Horn of Africa of the Anglican Diocese of Egypt, though there are no current local congregations.The Episcopal Area of the Horn of Africa The Adventist Mission indicates that there are no Adventist members in Somalia, and that Christianity in general has seen little growth there. Persecution by Muslims Due to the ongoing civil war in the southern part of the country, professing Christians in Somalia have faced persecution and sometimes death. Apart from Mogadishu Cathedral (which is no longer used for Christian services, although in 2013 plans to repair it were announced by the Diocese of Mogadiscio), there are no church buildings in the country. Nor is there any legal protection for Christians, some of whom meet in underground churches. Paramilitary groups in Somalia have also engaged in widespread looting of Christian graves, in addition to the desecration of Sufi Muslim graves and mosques. Sometimes the term \\"Christian\\" was a label that the jihadists would affix on people they suspected of working for Ethiopian intelligence. In August 2009, International Christian Concern reported that four Christians working to help orphans in Somalia were beheaded by Islamist extremists when they refused to convert to Islam. In December 2013, the Ministry of Justice and Religious Affairs released a directive prohibiting the celebration of Christian festivities in the country.

Since the fifth century, long before the founding of the Vatican City State in 1929, papal envoys (now known as nuncios) have represented the Holy See to foreign potentates. Additionally, papal representatives known not as nuncios but as apostolic delegates ensure contact between the Holy See and the Catholic Church in countries that do not have diplomatic relations with the Holy See. At present, there is one residential apostolic delegate, for Jerusalem and Palestine, as well as non- residential delegates for four countries (Brunei, Laos, Mauritania, and Somalia) and for the territories and countries without diplomatic relations with the Holy See in three regions (the Arabian Peninsula, the Caribbean, the Pacific Ocean). For Vietnam, the 21st-century appointees of the Holy See have been given the title \\"pontifical representative\\". In keeping with the \\"one China\\" policy, no representative is appointed for mainland China, and the Holy See is represented in Taipei by an apostolic nunciature, headed not by a nuncio, but only by a charg√© d'affaires. In addition to the countries mentioned above that have apostolic delegations, the following nations do not have diplomatic relations with the Holy See: Afghanistan, Bhutan, North Korea, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Tuvalu. Description In most respects the status of the diplomatic missions of the Holy See are identical with those of other countries, with the exception of the nomenclature: apostolic nuncios have ambassadorial rank and apostolic nunciatures are ranked as embassies. However, in most countries of central and western Europe and of central and southern America, as well as in a few countries elsewhere, the nuncio is granted precedence over other ambassadors and is dean of the diplomatic corps from the moment he presents his credentials. The Holy See, which does not issue visas, does not have consulates. Apostolic delegates and their missions do not have diplomatic status as nuncios and nunciatures do. In countries that allow it, the apostolic nunciature is sometimes, though rarely, located outside the capital, perhaps in towns with particularly important religious connections, such as the village of Rabat in Malta, the site of Saint Paul's grotto, and Harissa in Lebanon where Maronite, Greek Orthodox and Melkite Greek Catholic Church authorities are located. In other countries that is not permitted: when India opened diplomatic relations with the Holy See, the apostolic delegation moved from Bangalore to the capital, New Delhi; and in Australia the mission moved from Sydney to Canberra. In Israel, the nunciature is located in Tel Aviv.

It was founded as a student movement on 26 November 1967 in Karachi and remains the largest ethnic Baloch student body in the country. It got divided due to ideological differences. BSO Pajjar and BSO Mengal affiliated itself with the parliamentary framework of Pakistan. Dr Allah Nazar, founder of pro independence wing, In 2002 while he was studying in college, he created a breakaway faction ‚Äî BSO‚ÄìAzad ‚Äî that advocated struggle for an independent Balochistan based on pre-colonial Baloch country. The Pakistani government banned the BSO Azad on 15 March 2013, as a terrorist organisation. There is an alleged link between BSO and India, with Pakistan accusing the Indian intelligence agency RAW of having \\"assets\\" within BSO, an allegation denied by India and activists in BSO. Inception Baloch Students Organization (BSO) has its origins in Warna Waninda Gal (Youth Educational Forum) launched in 1961, three years after the Pakistan Army arrested the Khan of Kalat giving rise to Baloch nationalism. Abdul Hakeem Baloch was its first president. The stated objectives of the organization included \\"promoting Balochi language and literature and debating political conditions.\\" Adnan Amir, Resistance and Splits Mark the Story of BSO, Viewpoint, 19 June 2014. Another organization called Baloch Students Educational Organization (BSEO) was founded by Baloch students in Karachi in 1962. On 26 November 1967, after a three-day convention in Karachi, the two organizations merged into one forming the Baloch Students Organization. Nadeem Paracha, senior columnist at Dawn, characterises it as a \\"left wing\\" organisation. Nadeem F. Paracha, When the doves cry, Dawn, 2 February 2012. In addition to the original aims of Warna, BSO also aimed to campaign for the abolition of the One Unit system and limited provincial autonomy for Balochistan. The group initially campaigned for improved educational facilities in Balochistan. Its demonstrations led to many arrests and closure of student hostels. By 1969-70, the BSO was sweeping student union elections in the Baloch majority areas of Balochistan and it was allied with the National Students Federation in Karachi's universities and colleges.  Rise of nationalism (1970‚Äì1977)  Soon the organization got involved in the growing Baloch national movement, protesting against Ayub Khan's policies of political restriction and functional inequality which gave rise to widespread antagonism in the Baloch population. Spearheading the movement were the tribal elites, professional classes such as lawyers and doctors, and students. The student movement was supported by the \\"progressive\\" tribal leaders, Ataullah Mengal, Khair Bakhsh Marri and Ghous Bakhsh Bizenjo, who were also leading members of the National Awami Party (NAP). The NAP consulted the BSO on all major issues. In early 1969, the organization conducted many demonstrations in Quetta, protesting the One Unit system and the tribal jirga system. They called for the release of political prisoners. Several leaders later went on to become guerrilla leaders during the 1970s. BSO leader Abdul Hayee Baloch contested the 1970 elections and got elected to the Pakistan National Assembly, as a member of the NAP. Whereas the mainstream organization collaborated with the progressive tribal leaders, a faction was opposed to all forms of tribal privileges of the Sardars. They broke off into a separate splinter group Baloch Students Organization ‚Äì Awami, and allied themselves to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples Party. During the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, Bhutto formed a tripartite alliance with the NAP and Jamiat-e- Ulema-e-Islam (JUI). The NAP and BSO, being supporters of provincial autonomy, called for the release of Mujibur Rahman and the restoration of democracy, which earned the ire of the military government in Islamabad. After Bhutto came to power at the end of the war, he let the NAP-JUI coalition form a provincial government in Balochistan in April 1972. This was the first time that a \`national' government was allowed to function in Balochistan. However, Bhutto dismissed it ten months later on what are seen as \\"trumped up\\" charges. Among the long list of reasons cited for the dismissal was the allegation that the government was allowing the \`lawless behaviour' of the BSO. The dismissal was followed by the arrest of NAP leaders and the unleashing of military on the province. The Bhutto government actions set off a four-year insurgency (1973‚Äì77) in Balochistan. Many of the former BSO members participated in the guerrilla warfare against the state. One of the guerrilla bands was led by the former BSO leader Khair Jan Baloch. BSO activists in schools supplied guerrillas with money and materiel. The more militant members joined the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF). After four years of bloodshed, the insurgency came to end when Zia ul Haq came to power and declared a general amnesty. However, no meaningful change towards provincial autonomy occurred.  Fragmentation and reunification (1977‚Äì2006)  After his release from prison Ataullah Mengal went into exile and the remainder of the NAP split into several factions. The armed struggle against the Pakistani state was called off, leading the BSO to turn against the NAP. In 1978, it even dismissed its chairman Mueem Kahan Baloch on the grounds that he supported the NAP. The BSO remained the leading student organisation in Balochistan's campuses, protesting against the Zia ul Haq's dictatorship. It also denounced the Islamist Afghan resistance against the Soviet troops backed by the United States and Saudi Arabia. In 1981, it joined the United Students Movement, an alliance of left-wing ethno-nationalist student groups opposing the Zia regime and the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba. Large numbers of BSO activists were imprisoned during this period, said to be 60% of all prisoners in Balochistan. In 1984, the BSO‚ÄìAwami merged back into the main BSO, following the request of Hameed Baloch, who was given death sentence for an attempted assassination of an Omani colonel. However, fragmentation of the Baloch political parties gave rise to parallel fragmentation in the BSO as well. Some of the groups arising through the fragmentation were: * BSO‚ÄìSohb, led by Kahwar Baloch (1986‚Äì1990), allied to Progressive Youth Movement (PYM). * BSO‚ÄìYaseen, led by Yaseen Baloch (1988‚Äì1990), allied to Balochistan National Movement (BNM). * BSO‚ÄìMengal (1990‚Äì1998), allied to BNM‚ÄìMengal and Balochistan National Party (BNP). * BSO‚ÄìHayee (1990‚Äì2002), allied to BNM‚ÄìHayee. * BSO‚ÄìAman (1998‚Äì2006), allied to BNP‚ÄìMengal. * BSO‚ÄìStar (1998‚Äì2003). * BSO‚ÄìNadir Quddus (2002‚Äì2006), allied to the National Party. * BSO‚ÄìAzad, led by Allah Nazar Baloch (2002-2003). * BSO‚ÄìMuttahida, formed by merger of BSO‚ÄìAzad and BSO‚ÄìStar, led by Imdad Baloch (2003‚Äì2006). In February 2006, noticing the fragmentation arising from political party affiliations, all the factions came together and united into a single organization. The resulting BSO eventually came to be called BSO‚ÄìAzad (\\"free BSO\\"), signifying that it is not affiliated to any political party. However, the organization does support Khair Bakhsh Marri, the Baloch Liberation Army and the armed struggle of Brahamdagh Bugti. Malik Siraj Akbar, The end of BSO?, unpublished article, 4 January 2009. The National Party and Balochistan National Party then started their own student wings and gave them the name of BSO. They are referred to as BSO‚ÄìPajjar and BSO‚ÄìMohiuddin respectively. Zia Ur Rehman, Hunger strike, The Friday Times, 9 May 2014. BSO‚ÄìAzad is now considered the most influential political group in Balochistan.  BSO Azad (2006‚Äì)  BSO‚ÄìAzad was originally formed in 2002 from the members of BSO‚ÄìHayee who wanted to remain independent of political parties. According to some commentators, it advocated armed struggle for an independent Balochistan. Allah Nazar Baloch, who later became a separatist fighter, was its founder-chairman when he was still a medical student.Syed Shoaib Hasan, Analysis: Managing the Baloch insurgency, Dawn, 26 November 2014. In 2003, BSO‚ÄìStar, which was similarly made of members seeking independence from political parties in BSO‚ÄìMengal, merged with BSO‚ÄìAzad, and the combined organization was called BSO‚ÄìMuttahida (or \\"BSO‚ÄìUnited\\"). More often, it was simply called \\"the BSO,\\" recognizing its claim to be the main students organization.UNPO on Extrajudicial Killings and Disappearances of Political Prisoners from West Balochistan, UNPO, 27 October 2005. Malik Baloch and Imdad Baloch served as its chairmen till 2005. In March 2005, Imdad Baloch, and other activists were abducted from a flat in Karachi by security forces and tortured. The War on the Baloch: An Interview with Meerain Baloch, Naked Punch, 9 November 2014. In December 2005, the Balochistan conflict intensified with the Army starting operations in Dera Bugti and Kohlu. Following this, the BSO‚ÄìAman (the affiliated faction of BSO‚ÄìMengal) led by Amanullah Baloch and BSO‚ÄìHayee led by Asif Baloch also merged with BSO‚ÄìMuttihada forming a united BSO. Bashir Zaib Baloch served its chairman from 2006 to 2011. He was followed by Zahid Baloch, who was allegedly abducted by unidentified gunmen in March 2014. The BNP and the NP, having lost their affiliated factions to the unified BSO, started new student wings and gave them the name of \\"BSO.\\" The student wing of National Party is called BSO‚ÄìPajjar and that of BNP is called BSO‚ÄìMohiuddin. The unified BSO now calls itself BSO‚ÄìAzad to distinguish itself from these student wings. However, it is not to be confused with the original BSO‚ÄìAzad started by Allah Nazar.Yousaf Ajab Baloch, Ban on BSO-Azad: Where is democracy‚Ä¶..?, Bolan Voice, 28 April 2013. The original BSO‚ÄìAzad is said to have been formed from the \\"most militant sections\\" of the BSO. It advocated radical struggle for \`national liberation' and stood for full independence for Balochistan. After its consolidation by Allah Nazar Baloch in 2002, when he was a medical student, the group is said to have obtained wide support among the Baloch students. Senior columnist of Dawn, Nadeem F. Paracha, states that it was directly involved in the formation of insurgency groups such as the Balochistan Liberation Army and Baloch Republican Army. The Pakistani state is said to view the organization with such concern as to ban it in 2013, a month before the elections.From rallies to armed resistance in Balochistan, Al Jazeera, 6 May 2014. The Asian Human Rights Commission condemned the ban and severely castigated the Pakistan government. It said that \\"in an effort to show the international community that it is taking action against the fundamentalist and religious terrorist organizations,\\" the government has banned three secular and nationalist organizations instead, while it showed \\"continued loyalties towards the Taliban and similar terrorist groups.\\"PAKISTAN: The government bans secular and nationalist groups to appease the fundamentalist and Taliban groups, Asian Human Rights Commission, 5 April 2013. Karima Baloch in a video message to the Indian Prime Minister Its leader Zahid Baloch was abducted in March 2014. His whereabouts are not known. 29 year-old Karima Baloch, a psychology student, then became the leader. Karima insists that the organization uses peaceful means by carrying out demonstrations and marches. It aims to raise the political awareness of the people. However, she has also added that any struggle against injustice is legitimate, whether \\"peaceful or armed.\\" Malik Siraj Akbar, a Harvard-based political analyst, calls it a \\"very unique organization that does not have any parallels in Pakistan.\\" It is one of the very few organizations that have managed to mobilize women at a social and political level.

The former leader Zahid Baloch was abducted in Quetta in March 2014 in front of eyewitnesses by men who arrived in SUVs used by the Pakistan Army. Zahid was made to squat on the road and hit on the head several times, after which he was blindfolded and taken away. The Police have refused to register a complaint. The organization has been protesting his abduction ever since. The organization also called for a nationwide strike in April 2014, which was supported by all Baloch nationalist parties. Many towns in Balochistan observed a shut down. Activist Latif Johar went on a hunger strike, which he called off after 46 days at the behest of human rights activist Mir Mohammad Ali Talpur. The organization has also approached the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights asking him to intervene with the Pakistan government and secure the release of Zahid Baloch.Calls for the Release of Zahid Baloch , International Policy Digest, 27 April 2014. According to Al Jazeera, Zahid's abduction is only the latest among a long list of abductions of BSO‚ÄìAzad's leadership, which represent the Pakistani state's attempt to suppress the independence movement. Most that are abducted remain missing, others are tortured and killed before the corpses are dumped in the country. In November 2015, Karima Baloch went to Canada as a refugee. She said that she escaped a Pakistani military attack on the town of Tump and stayed underground for nearly a year before arriving in Toronto. It is reported that she intends to apply for refugee status in Canada.Tarek Fatah, Refugee arrives in T.O., takes off niqab: 'I knew I was safe', Toronto Sun, 24 June 2016.

BSO Pajjar BSO Pajjar, led by Zubair Baloch, has the largest following among the Baloch students. It represents a mainstream viewpoint and concentrates on ideological and educational aspects of Baloch national movement. It attempts to get as many Baloch youth educated as possible and holds regular \`study circles' in which it imparts education in the history and ideology of Baloch nationalist movement. Its main objectives are advancing the rights of the Baloch people and the termination of military operations. This group has affiliated itself with the National Party (NP), the ruling party in Baluchistan. NP wants more provincial rights and greater autonomy for Baluchistan province within the parliamentary framework of Pakistan. BSO Mengal BSO Mengal, led by Nazeer Baloch, was formed in the early 2000s. Though it subscribes to the radical nationalist ideology of Balochistan's secession from Pakistan, it has affiliated itself with the mainstream Balochistan National Party (Mengal) (BNP‚ÄìM), which is the largest opposition party in the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan. The group has gathered enough support from the student body since its split from the united BSO and demands \\"total autonomy\\" for Balochistan. It promotes the rights of Brahui residents in central Balochistan within the parliamentary framework of Pakistan. Alleged link with India In 2016 an Indian national called Kulbhushan Yadav was arrested by Pakistani security forces claiming that he was an in-service commander ranked officer in the Indian Navy and a spy working for Indian intelligence agencies. They charged him with espionage and released a pre-recorded statement of Yadav confessing to being a spy working for the Indian intelligence agency RAW and admitting that he had been in touch with its contacts in Pakistan, especially those in the BSO. He also stated that he was to support the insurgency by coordinating subversion, violent activities against the general population, targeting attacks against strategic assets in the region, and against Chinese workers.Pakistan Claims Arrest of ‚ÄòRAW Agent‚Äô in Balochistan.

Meltzoff (born February 9, 1950) is an American psychologist and an internationally recognized expert on infant and child development. His discoveries about infant imitation greatly advanced the scientific understanding of early cognition, personality and brain development. Background Meltzoff received a B.A. from Harvard University in 1972 and a D.Phil. (Ph.D.) from Oxford University in 1976 with Jerome Bruner as his thesis advisor. A professor of psychology at the University of Washington since 1988, he is currently co-director of the University of Washington Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences. The Institute is an interdisciplinary scientific research center on human learning. He is married to the internationally recognized speech and hearing scientist and language acquisition researcher Patricia K. Kuhl. Early research In 1977, Science published the ground-breaking paper \\"Imitation of Facial and Manual Gestures by Human Neonates\\" by Meltzoff, who was still at Oxford, and M. Keith Moore of the University of Washington.Meltzoff, A.N. and Moore, M.K. (1977). \\"Imitation of Facial and Manual Gestures by Human Neonates\\", Science, 198, 75-78. According to the abstract, > Infants between 12 and 21 days of age can imitate both facial and manual > gestures; this behavior cannot be explained in terms of either conditioning > or innate releasing mechanisms. Such imitation implies that human neonates > can equate their own unseen behaviors with gestures they see others perform. Six infants were each shown three facial gestures and one manual gesture, sequentially. Their responses were videotaped and scored by observers who did not know which gesture the infants had seen. The statistically significant results showed that infants of this young age were able to imitate all four gestures. The experiment was ground-breaking because it showed infant imitation of adults at a much earlier age than was thought possible. Jean Piaget, for instance, had thought that infants reached the stage of facial imitation at 8 to 12 months. The study also showed early facial imitation, something previously thought to be impossible at this young age because of its necessarily crossmodal nature. (Infants can see others' faces but not their own; they can feel their own facial movements, but not those of others.) The findings had implications not only for theoretical psychology, but also for the study of memory, learning, language acquisition, and socialization. A similar study was later done with a group of 40 infants with a mean age of 72 hours (youngest 42 minutes), with the same results, showing that the intermodal mapping infants displayed was unlikely to be learned.Meltzoff, A.N. and Moore, M.K. (1983). \\"Newborn Infants Imitate Adult Facial Gestures\\", Child Development, 54, 702-709. However, later studies have suggested that while neonatal imitation of tongue protrusion is widespread, the findings for the imitation of other gestures at this young age are more mixed.Anisfeld, M. (1996). \\"Only Tongue Protrusion Modelling is Matched by Neonates\\", Developmental Review, 16, 149-161.Jones, S.S. (2007). \\"Imitation in Infancy: the Development of Mimicry\\", Psychological Science, 18, 593-599. Methodological innovations Preverbal infant psychology is notoriously difficult to study. Meltzoff and his colleagues had to develop new techniques for eliciting and interpreting infant responses to stimuli. One method was measuring an infant's visual preference for an object. In one study, infants were allowed to touch but not see a distinctively shaped object. Later they were shown (but could not touch) that object and a different object. The length of time they gazed at each object was measured. Infants looked longer at the object they had previously touched, thus demonstrating an ability to recognize the object with a different sense.Meltzoff, A.N., & Borton, R.W. (1979). \\"Intermodal matching by human neonates\\". Nature, 282, 403-404. In another experiment, babies' sucking on a pacifier was recorded, and a picture was shown to them. When the sucking stopped, the picture disappeared. Babies were found to suck longer when the picture showed a familiar face than when it showed an unfamiliar one. Later research Later research has included the investigation of memory;Meltzoff, A.N., & Moore, M.K. (1994). \\"Imitation, memory, and the representation of persons\\".

Muir (Eds.), Gaze following: Its development and significance (pp. 217-241). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum. Theory Based on his work on imitation, Meltzoff has developed the \\"like me\\" hypothesis of infant development. This involves three steps. First, there is an intrinsic, supramodal connection in the infant mind between observed acts and similar executed acts (the correspondence reported in the 1977 and 1983 studies cited above). Secondly, infants experience a regular association between their own acts and their own underlying mental states. This is based on everyday experience. Third, infants project their own internal experiences onto others performing similar acts. As a result, infants begin to acquire an understanding of other minds and their mental states (desires, visual perception and basic emotions, for instance). This hypothesis suggests that it is imitation that is inborn, and the understanding of other's mental states is a consequence. Other researchers have suggested the opposite, that imitation is a consequence of an understanding of others. But Meltzoff's early imitation studies clearly favor the former possibility.Meltzoff, Andrew N.

Such eggs could then be fertilized by sperm. The procedure was conceived by Calum MacKellar, a Scottish bioethicist. With this technique, two males could be the biological parents of a child. However, such a procedure would additionally require an artificial womb or a female gestational carrier.EUROPEAN BIOETHICAL RESEARCH: \\"CHILDREN WITH TWO GENETIC FATHERS\\" Telegraph.co.uk: \\"Genetic offspring for gays 'a possibility'\\"New Scientist: \\"Baby talk\\"CBC news: \\"Timeline: Assisted reproduction and birth control\\"BBC News: \\"Male-only conception 'highly speculative'\\"Center for Genetics and Society: \\"Are male eggs and female sperm on the horizon?\\" In 2003, researcher Hans Robert Sch√∂ler at the University Of Pennsylvania successfully created eggs using both male and female mouse DNA.

This article focuses on the second definition. Since the late 1980s, scientists have explored how to produce sperm where all of the chromosomes come from a female donor. In the late 1990s, this concept became a partial reality when scientists in Japan developed chicken female sperm by injecting bone marrow stem cells from a female chicken into a rooster's testicles. This technique proved to fall below expectations.  Female sperm production  Creating female sperm was first raised as a possibility in a patent filed in 1991 by injecting a woman's cells into a man's testicles, though the patent focused mostly on injecting altered male cells into a man's testes (to correct genetic diseases). In 1997, Japanese scientists partially confirmed such techniques by creating chicken female sperm in a similar manner. \\"However, the ratio of produced W chromosome-bearing (W-bearing) spermatozoa fell substantially below expectations. It is therefore concluded that most of the W-bearing PGC could not differentiate into spermatozoa because of restricted spermatogenesis.\\" These simple transplantation methods follow from earlier observations by developmental biologists that germ stem cells are autonomous in the sense that they can begin the processes to become both sperm and eggs. One potential roadblock to injecting a woman's cells into a man's testicles is that the man's immune system might attack and destroy the woman's cells. In usual circumstances, when foreign cells (such as cells or organs from other people, or infectious bacteria) are put into a human body, its immune system will reject such cells or organs. However, a special property of a man's testicles is that they are immune-privileged, that is, a man's immune system will not attack foreign cells (such as a woman's cells) injected into the sperm- producing part of the testicles. Thus, a woman's cells will remain in the man's testicles long enough to be converted into sperm. However, there are more serious challenges. Biologists have well established that male sperm production relies on certain genes on the Y chromosome, which, when missing or defective, lead to such men producing little to no sperm in their testicles. An analogy, then, is that a cell from a woman has complete Y chromosome deficiency. While many genes on the Y chromosome have backups (homologues) on other chromosomes, a few genes such as RBMY on the Y chromosome do not have such backups, and their effects must be compensated for to convert cells from a woman into sperm. In 2007, a patent application was filed on methods for creating human female sperm using artificial or natural Y chromosomes and testicular transplantation. Key to successful creation of female sperm (and male eggs) will be inducing male epigenetic markings for female cells that initially have female markings, with techniques for doing so disclosed in the patent application. In 2018 Chinese research scientists produced 29 viable mice offspring from two female mother mice by creating sperm-like structures from haploid embryonic stem cells using gene editing to alter imprinted regions of DNA. Experts noted that there was little chance of these techniques being applied to humans in the near future.  Bone marrow stem cell conversion  Scientists from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne led by biologist Karim Nayernia discovered a method of creating partly developed sperm cells, otherwise known as \\"spermatogonial\\" stem cells, from the bone marrow of male volunteers, entirely in-vitro (outside the human body), and is seeking funding to see whether such techniques can be used to make female sperm.  Same-sex procreation  If created, a \\"female sperm\\" cell could fertilize an egg cell, a procedure that, among other potential applications, might enable female same-sex couples to produce a child who would be the biological offspring of their two mothers. It is also claimed that production of female sperm may stimulate a woman to be both the mother and father (similar to asexual reproduction) of an offspring produced by her own sperm. Many queries, both ethical and moral, arise over these arguments.

Biography=Early life Born in Bluff in 1886 and was educated at the Bluff State Primary School and St. Patrick's College in Wellington. He was the second born son of future Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward. He found employment with the National Bank of New Zealand at Wellington before leaving for England in 1907 where he worked first with the merchant firm Messrs.' James Morrison and Son and then at the insurance branch of Lloyds Bank. In 1908 he travelled to New York, spending a period with the U.S. Steel corporation. Ward then left for Montreal in 1911 where he became joint manager of the New Zealand Shipping Company. During World War I he served in the Motor Boat Patrol, gaining his commission in 1915 while Canada. After the war he went to New York for the British Ministry of Shipping before returning to New Zealand in 1920. Upon his arrival in New Zealand he moved to Christchurch and joined his fathers firm, Messrs.' J. G. Ward and Co. He married Sybil Mary Petre in 1927. She was the daughter of Henry William Petre and the sister of Francis Petre. Political career He first became involved in politics in 1922 he became his father's private secretary prior to the unsuccessful Tauranga by-election, before moving to Wellington after Sir Joseph re-entered Parliament in 1925. He remained as private secretary for the duration of Sir Joseph's second period as Prime Minister. He replaced his father in the 13 August for the parliamentary seat of Invercargill that was held after Sir Joseph died. He stood for the United Party, retaining the seat for the government. He retired from Parliament at the next general election in 1931. He was subsequently appointed to the Legislative Council on 22 June 1934 by Sir Joseph's successor as Prime Minister, George Forbes. At the expiry of his first term, he was reappointed on 23 June 1941 by Peter Fraser. He served until his death on 9 February 1946. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. In 1938 he unsuccessfully stood for the Wellington City Council on a Citizens' Association ticket. Later life and death In later life he was director of several companies and also became secretary of the Wellington Metropolitan Patriotic Council in September 1940. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1946 New Year Honours. Ward died in Wellington on 9 February 1946, aged 60.

Duncan made his debut for Carlton in Round 1 of the 1921 season. He retired from VFL football in 1930, having played 141 senior games for Carlton, and four interstate games for Victoria. He is especially remembered for his performance in \\"Duncan's match\\". Footballer=Carlton He made his debut for Carlton on 7 May 1921, playing on the half-forward flank, against Richmond, at the Punt Road ground. A crowd of 32,000 saw Carlton defeat Richmond by 9 points, 7.11 (53) to 8.14 (62). He played 15 senior matches in 1924; and, with 27 goals, he was Carlton's top goalkicker. Stratford Apparently for the sake of his wife's health, he decided to leave the city, and Carlton; and, in January 1925, a public meeting at Stratford, Victoria appointed Duncan the captain-coach of the Stratford Football Club.Stratford Football Club: Coach Appointed, The Gippsland Times, (Monday, 12 January 1925), p. 2. He was given a house, rent-free, a job, and was also to be paid an additional salary of ‚Ç§8 a week as captain-coach. Having left Carlton on good terms,Duncan had \\"received a very fine certificate, framed in oak, from the Carlton Foot ball Club for the fine services rendered that Club during the last four years\\" (Stratford, The Gippsland Times, (Thursday, 26 March 1925, p.3). \\"R. A. Duncan\\" was granted a clearance from Carlton to Stratford on 25 March 1925.League Permits Granted, The Argus, (Thursday, 26 March 1925), p.10. On 2 May 1925, \\"Alex. Duncan (Stratford's coach and captain) marked his first appearance in Gippsland football‚Ä¶ by winning the toss, playing a good game, kicking five goals and leading his side to victory [over Rosedale, 13.14 (92) to 9.7 (61)]\\".Notes by \\"Full Back\\", The Traralgon Record , (Friday, 8 May 1925), p. 3. The Stratford team, which had not won a single match in 1924, and only two in 1923, won a number of matches under Duncan, despite problems with an ever-increasing absence of stronger players as the season went on, and were still potential finalists until they were soundly beaten by Maffra, 7.11 (53) to 2.4 (16), in the last match of the home-and-away season on 19 September 1925 (the match was marred by a very strong wind blowing across the ground for the entire match). At the end of the 1925 season, he returned to Melbourne, ready to resume his career with Carlton the following season.Popular Footballer farewelled: Mr. Duncan Honored, The Gippsland Times, (Thursday, 1 October 1925), p. 4. Return to Carlton The Age, Monday, 27 June 1927 The Age, Monday, 27 June 1927 Moved from the forward line to centre half-back, he played his first return game for Carlton, against Melbourne at Princes Park on 8 May 1926 (round two). There was an influenza epidemic in Melbourne at the time, and Duncan was bedridden on the day of the first match of the season.  \\"Duncan's match\\"  The encounter between Carlton and Collingwood Football Club at Victoria Park on Saturday, 25 June 1927, in which a strong Carlton team outmuscled, outplayed, and (coming from behind) beat a champion Collingwood team playing at its peak, is one of the most famous encounters in the game's history; and is remembered as \\"Duncan's Match\\".1927 VFL season#Round 9; Ross, (1996), p. 124; Blueseum Game Review of Duncan's Match Playing at centre-halfback, the \\"impassable\\" and \\"unbeatable\\" Duncan dominated the game as, perhaps, no other player has done before or since.Without in any way denigrating Duncan's performance on that day, it should be remembered that ‚Äî ostensibly to reduce \\"the unseemly bullocking in the ruck at boundary throwins\\" (Ross, 1996, p. 114) ‚Äî the laws of the game had been altered in 1925 so that the last player to have touched the ball before it went out of bounds was penalized by the awarding of a free kick to the opposing team. This meant that, whilst this law was in operation (1925‚Äì?1939), much of the play was directed up the centre of the ground along the goal-to-goal line, and very little play was directed along the flanks. According to The Age, \\"Duncan's meteoric marking and wonderfully dashing defence was the most sparkling individual performance of the season\\".A Memorable Contest, The Age, (Monday, 27 June 1927), p. 8. According to The Argus, \\"Duncan his played many fine games for Carlton, and has also been a tower of strength in interstate teams, but he has never been seen to better advantage. His marking was superb, his judgment faultless, and his kicking splendid, while his dash turned many attacks.\\"Collingwood Outplayed: Brilliant Win by Carlton: Best Players, (Monday, 27 June 1927), p. 6. He took at least 33 marks (some claim he had taken as many as 45) and his beautiful drop-kicks on that day were as flawless as his marking.On 23 June 1951, in a drawn match between Fitzroy Football Club 12.13 (85) and South Melbourne 12.13 (85) which, although conducted under different \\"out of bounds rules\\", was played at the small, narrow Brunswick Street Oval in North Fitzroy, the 1949 Brownlow Medal winner, South Melbourne's Ron \\"Smokey\\" Clegg took 32 marks. Carlton won the match 14.11 (95) to Collingwood's 13.5 (83). Collingwood, a football club not generally known for magnanimous gestures towards its opponents, were so impressed with Duncan's outstanding performance (perhaps, even, a best of all time performance) that they had the match ball suitably mounted and inscribed and presented the trophy to Duncan.

His first senior match in 1936 for Coburg was on 13 June 1936 (round nine), when he played at centre half-back against Preston (\\"Alex Duncan gave a creditable performance at centre half-back in the first game for the season\\"), and Coburg won by 33 points.High Scoring Game: Preston Without Hyde, The Argus, (Monday, 15 June 1936), p. 15.

Tribunals Despite coming a close equal second with Melbourne's Dick Taylor to Collingwood's Syd Coventry in the 1927 Brownlow Medal, having been declared best on the ground in six matches, compared with Coventry's seven (at that stage only one vote was given to one player in each game),Brownlow Medal: Won by S. Coventry, The Argus, (15 September 1927), p. 5. In the only match that Carlton played against Collingwood that year (round nine), Duncan was far, far better than anyone else on the ground, including Coventry (it was \\"Duncan's match\\"). Duncan had quite a history of rough play.  Carlton (July 1922)  During the particularly torrid match against Collingwood at Princes Park on 29 July 1922, which Carlton won, Duncan scored three goals despite being knocked out on two separate occasions. Eric Cock was found guilty of punching Duncan (he claimed that Duncan had kicked him in the ankle and verbally abused him), and was suspended for six matches. Duncan was found guilty of having elbowed Harry Saunders, and was suspended for three matches. Saunders pleaded guilty to punching Duncan, pleading provocation; he was suspended for six matches and was fined ¬£5 by the police for his assault on Duncan.Blows During Football: Three League Players Disqualified, The Argus, (Saturday, 5 August 1922), p. 22. Carlton (June 1924)  In a torrid, low-scoring match at a windswept Princes Park on 21 June 1924, against Richmond, which Richmond won 5.8 (38) to 3.10 (38), Duncan was reported three times: for elbowing Reuben Reid, for kicking George Rudolph whilst he was on the ground, and for making an offensive gesture towards Boundary Umpire Johnson.Football: Players Suspended, The Age, (Friday, 27 June 1924), p. 7. Duncan was acquitted of all three charges due to lack of corroborating evidence; whilst Richmond's Reid, cited for \\"charging\\" Horrie Clover, was suspended for three matches, and Donald Don of Richmond, cited for \\"charging\\" Newton Chandler from behind, was suspended for eleven matches.Charges of Rough Play; Two Players Disqualified, The Argus, (Friday, 27 June 1924), p. 5.  Stratford (May 1925)  In his second match as captain-coach of Stratford, Duncan was reported, by the Sale Football Club (i.e., rather than any of the match officials), for using obscene language on the playing arena, directed at N. \\"Tiny\\" Wilson ‚Äî a 6ft 4in (193cm) member of the Sale team ‚Äî during the match against Sale Football Club on 9 May 1925.Football Tribunal: Three Players Stood Down: Wilson and Duncan, The Traralgon Record, (Friday, 22 May 1925), p. 2. In the tribunal hearing the field umpire (D. E. Paterson) stated that Duncan had been awarded a mark; and, on the way back to take his kick, Duncan was struck by Wilson with a deliberate blow, and \\"was 'out' for about five minutes\\". Play resumed after ten minutes; and the umpire stated that he \\"did not hear any language\\". In giving his evidence, Duncan stated that after he had taken the mark he was kicked on the leg and, without using any bad language, he had said \\"Cut it out Wilson, you have been at it all day.\\" He was then struck by Wilson. The Sale delegate admitted that Wilson had kicked Duncan. Wilson claimed that, he had \\"struck Duncan under great provocation\\" and that, as Duncan went back to take his kick, Duncan had said \\"You mongrel ‚Äî \\" (the newspaper did not print the word). Wilson claimed that he had replied \\"What! you say that again and I'll punch you under the ear\\", to which, he claimed, Duncan had replied \\"You dirty ‚Äî \\"; and, he said, it was only then that he had struck Duncan. The Stratford delegate made the obvious comment that, if such an interchange had occurred, \\"\\"Duncan would have been prepared for a blow\\"; when, in fact, he was most obviously not expecting any sort of attack. Duncan protested that Sale had only complained to retaliate for Wood having been reported by the field umpire. After much discussion Wood was suspended for four matches (for striking Duncan) and Duncan two (for using obscene language to Wilson).Football Tribunal: Wilson and Duncan, The Gippsland Times, (Thursday, 21 May 1925), p. 3. thumb500pxrightThe Victorian Football League‚Äôs Interstate team that drew with South Australia, in Adelaide, 13.10 (88) to 11.22 (88) on Saturday, 16 June 1928.

Eventually, due to a technicality (the case had not been submitted to the tribunal within seven days of the match) the case was not heard, and the charges against Duncan were consequently dismissed.Objection Upheld, The Argus, (Friday, 2 October 1925), p. 6.  Carlton (May 1926)  During the round three match against Geelong, at Geelong on 15 May 1926, Duncan was reported for the \\"unseemly conduct\\" of throwing the football into the face of Lloyd Hagger, the Geelong forward who had been the VFL's leading goal-kicker in the preceding season (1925). Duncan was, perhaps, the best player for Carlton on the day. Hagger had been awarded a free kick, against Duncan, in the second quarter, because Duncan had pushed him in the back; as Hagger began to raise himself from the ground, and prepare to take his kick, Duncan spitefully threw the ball into his face. Duncan was found guilty and was suspended for four matches. Football: LeagueTribunal: Two Players Suspended, The Argus, (Friday, 21 May 1926), p. 5.

Coburg (August 1935)  During the 1935 VF first semi-final played on 17 August 1935, between Coburg and Camberwell, Duncan (Coburg's captain-coach) was charged with deliberately pushing Ernest Dyball of Camberwell after a free kick had been awarded in the last quarter of the match. Duncan pleaded guilty; but argued in his own defence that he had not heard the umpire's whistle blow, and had pushed Dyball to delay the play. Given Duncan's defence, the tribunal considered that there was reasonable doubt whether Duncan had, indeed, deliberately pushed Dyball in the full knowledge that Dyball had been awarded a free kick, and dismissed the charge.Charges Dismissed, The Argus, (Thursday, 22 August 1935), p. 13.

He was, at 27, the head of the Second Japanese Embassy to Europe (Japanese:Á¨¨ÔºíÂõûÈÅ£Ê¨ß‰ΩøÁØÄ), also called the Ikeda Mission, sent in 1863-1864 by the Tokugawa shogunate to negotiate the cancellation of the open-port status of Yokohama. The mission was sent following the 1863 \\"Order to expel barbarians\\" (ÊîòÂ§∑ÂÆüË°å„ÅÆÂãÖÂëΩ) issued by Emperor K≈çmei, and the Bombardment of Shimonoseki incidents, in a wish to close again the country to Western influence, and return to sakoku status. Nagaoki left with a mission of 36 men on a French warship, stopped in Shanghai, India and Cairo through the Suez canal. His mission visited the pyramids, a feat which Antonio Beato photographed at the time. He finally arrived in Marseille and then Paris, where he met with Napoleon III and with Philipp Franz von Siebold. He stayed at the Grand Hotel in Paris. The request to close Japanese harbours to Westerners was doomed as Yokohama was the key springboard for Western activity in Japan. The mission was a total failure. Nagaoki however was very impressed with the advancement of French civilization, and became very active in promoting the dispatch of embassies and students abroad, once he had returned to Japan. He was finally put under house arrest by the Bakufu. Nagaoki brought many documents from France, related especially to physics, biology, manufacture, textiles and also fermentation technologies. He is considered as one of the fathers of the wine industry in Japan.

It won the 2006 NSW Premier's Literary Award for Best Play. It was first staged at Sydney's Griffin Theatre Company in February 2005, where it broke box office records. It is published by Currency Press with Murphy's stage adaptation of Timothy Conigrave's Holding the Man. It is published in the UK by Nick Hern Books. Synopsis Strangers in Between explores brotherhood. Shane flees his family in regional Goulburn and finds himself in Sydney's Kings Cross. He attempts to build a surrogate family in the city. He confuses the two families. The city lover he worships is doubled and morphed with the brother he fears. Peter, an older man who is dealing with the imminent death of his elderly mother, is himself rendered maternal by the needs of runaway Shane. Reviews A reviewer of the first UK performance wrote that: > Tommy Murphy‚Äôs Strangers in Between is one of the most beautifully written, > achingly honest, and devastating insights into the life of a person growing > up in a world that refuses to understand who that person truly is. Full of > hope, raucous ribaldry, and sweet, tender moments of connection between > disparate souls who eventually form a family,... It is wrapped in love, > acceptance and understanding. Absolutely unmissable. The Age describes the 2018 Melbourne revival of the play as \\"a three-hander exploring, with sharp humour and emotional nuance, the passions and fears of growing up gay... a story so funny and tender and wild, and so beautifully acted, that anyone might recognise and connect with it\\". http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/stage/melbourne-stage/strangers-in- between-review-comingofage-story--funny-tender-and-wild-20180126-h0ou01.html The Times critic in London wrote a four star review for the play. \\"Murphy unspools his dramatic premise neatly and with minimal contrivance, abetted by this admirably economical production‚Äôs almost ceremonially efficient scene changes. Yet what really hooks us into the people on stage is the cast‚Äôs three-dimensional grasp of character and their expertise with the rhythms of Murphy‚Äôs dialogue. Stephen Connery-Brown evinces especially crack timing as Peter, a mature male who is far more protector than predator. Dan Hunter manages the tricky task of essaying two roles ‚Äì decent Will and manipulative Ben ‚Äì with considerable aplomb. Pivotally, Roly Botha rides the edgy emotional rollercoaster that is Shane with a tender, bruised charm. The boy is insecure, even unstable; nervous to the point of paranoia; desperately needy and at times thoughtlessly impulsive and blunt. Yet we come to care about him. Sex, meanwhile, is treated with humorous candour. The key to understanding Murphy‚Äôs men is about much more than what they do in bed.\\" The Independent's critic lauded the play as deserving of its West End transfer. \\"...wise and witty coming-of-age play about facing fears, about friendships forged across the generations, and about making your own surrogate family. The tone combines the sharp and the sweet, the charmingly funny, the slightly rose-tinted and the completely explicit\\". https://www.independent.co.uk/arts- entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/strangers-in-between-trafalgar-studios- review-a8159986.html The original 2005 production was summed up by Sydney's Sun Herald critic Colin Rose. \\"‚Ä¶there‚Äôs an honesty and openness to Murphy's writing that is irresistibly heart-warming, an appeal which, I imagine, is pretty much universal\\".

He held the post of Bailiff of Guernsey from 1935 to 1946. Carey was a leading member of one of Guernsey's oldest families. In 1935, when incumbent Baliff Arthur William Bell died, Carey, who had been Receiver General from 1912 to 1935, replaced him because Procurer Ambrose Sherwill, to whom the role would have normally fallen, had only been in office a few weeks.  Pre war  He was born 2 July 1871 in Guernsey, son of de Vic Francis Carey and Harriet Mary Gosselin. He was educated at Elizabeth College 1880-3, Marlborough College 1885-7, and Caen University, France 1895-7, where he studied law. He married Adelaide Eleanor Jeffreys on 23 March 1899. From 1935 until the Germans landed at Guernsey airport, he fulfilled the duties of Bailiff, both as head of the Courts of Guernsey and as head of the States of Guernsey. The civil authorities of Guernsey, represented by their Bailiff, the elected members of the island parliaments, civil servants and emergency services, had of necessity to work in a professional manner with the occupiers for the benefit of the civil population. They had been ordered to do this by the Secretary of State in letters dated 19 June 1940. The Bailiff oversaw the evacuation of 17,000 children and adults to England in June 1940.  German Occupation  During the Nazi German occupation of the Channel Islands, which began on 30 June 1940, German authorities seized control of the Bailiwick. Age 69 at the beginning of the Occupation, Carey was considered too old to be able to function as the executive of the Island Authorities on his own. Therefore, in contrast to the situation in Jersey, which had a 48 year old Bailiff, Alexander Coutanche, the Bailiff of Guernsey's powers were actually reduced during the Occupation as day-to-day running of Island affairs became the responsibility of a Controlling Committee made up of a small number of members of the States of Guernsey, chaired at first by Ambrose Sherwill, and after Sherwill's imprisonment for aiding British soldiers trapped on the Island, by Jurat John Leale. The Bailiff remained a higher authority, only entering into the political foray when the actions of the Controlling Committee had yielded an unsatisfactory outcome. Carey and the Controlling Committee cooperated with the German commander in the interest of the civil population under their care. The census of islanders the Germans ordered in autumn 1941, combined with the pre-war aliens registration records, the police records of enemy aliens who had been detained in May/June 1940 combined with the German requirement for people of the Jewish faith to register, gave the Germans the names of most of the Jews in Guernsey and the nearby island of Sark. Three Jews were deported to German-occupied France in April 1942, where they took jobs and from where, several months later they were picked up in a roundup of French Jews and were eventually killed in Auschwitz-Birkenau. After the war a British Military Intelligence report said ‚Äúwhen the Germans proposed to put their anti-Jewish measures into force, no protest whatever was raised by any of the Guernsey officials and they hastened to give the Germans every assistance‚Äù. A private memorandum from a senior judge, Lord Justice du Parcq, to the Home Secretary, James Chuter-Ede, in 1945 comments on allegations of collaboration within the Jersey and Guernsey administrations. He specifies the Channel Island governments' collaboration in the deportation of 2,000 English and [8] Jews to camps in 1942. 'I think that a strong case can be made . . . that the authorities ought to have refused to give any assistance in the performance of this violation of international law. I have had some communication with the War Crimes Commission on the subject, and I know that the Commission has recommended the prosecution of the Germans responsible . . . I should feel happier if I thought a strong line had been taken.' Of the Bailiff of Guernsey, Victor Carey, he says: 'There is strong feeling in responsible quarters in Guernsey against the Bailiff by reason of the orders issued by him. Some at least were shocked by the use of the words 'enemy forces' to describe His Majesty's and Allied Forces, and by the promise of a pounds 25 reward to any informer against a person writing the V sign (symbol of resistance) or other words calculated to offend the German authorities.' This condemnation was made without understanding that people undertaking such petty offences risked not only long imprisonment for themselves, but innocent islanders in the area it was committed, who the Germans had threatened with severe punishment and on occasions enforced collective punishments. The lack of understanding was compounded by not realising that laws were passed by the States of Guernsey, or the Controlling Committee, not by the Bailiff. A few published works have criticised his role in the government of the Bailiwick during this period (see, for example, Madeline Bunting's The Model Occupation).Madeline Bunting, 'The Model Occupation: The Channel Islands Under German Rule, 1940‚Äì1945', 2004 This opinion is in the minority, on the whole he remains a figure of considerable repute in Guernsey itself. The island governments, headed by their bailiffs, Victor Carey in Guernsey and Alexander Coutanche in Jersey, had been ordered by the British Government to remain on their islands to maintain law and order and to do what they could for the civilians. This put them under a duty of care. When the lieutenant governors, who were the King's representatives on each island, departed on 21 June 1940, their powers and duties were vested in the bailiffs, namely to protect the islands and their population, taking on the duties of the Lieutenant Governors added a further duty of care. However, for the part of the island‚Äôs population that was Jewish this ‚Äòduty of care‚Äô was abrogated by the ‚ÄòThird Order‚Äô registered in the Royal Courts of Guernsey on 17th June, 1941. This law prohibited all persons deemed Jews from carrying on any kind of business on the island, without compensation, adding further that no Jew was to be engaged as a ‚Äòhigher official or as an employee who comes into contact with customers‚Äô and Jewish employees should ‚Äòbe dismissed and replaced by non-Jewish employees‚Äô.http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/nazioccupation/channelislands.html  Post-war  Theobald Mathew, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and MI5‚Äôs Joseph Richmond Stopford agreed in July 1945 that the idea of awarding decorations to the Channel Island bailiffs was ‚Äúrashly conceived.‚ÄùNational Archives, Public Record Office (London), KV / 4 / 78. Note on meeting with the Director of Public Prosecutions, Major Stepford, 30 June 1945. When Carey‚Äôs name was submitted for honours to Prime Minister Clement Attlee in October 1945, Attlee asked Home Secretary Chuter Ede to explain the discrepancies between the negative Mathew and Stopford report and Ede's positive view. Ede explained that his investigations concluded that Mathews found the Channel Island authorities had ‚Äúbehaved well, animated by the sole desire to act as a buffer‚ÄùNational Archives, Public Record Office (London), HO / 45 / 22399. The Home Secretary to the Prime Minister, 2 November 1945. ‚Äî which contradicts Mathew‚Äôs actual comments ‚Äî and that the newly appointed Channel Island Lieutenant Governors confirmed that both bailiffs deserved commendation. Neither Jersey's Lieutenant Governor Arthur Edward Grasett nor Guernsey's Lieutenant Governor Philip Neame were present in the Channel Islands during the occupation.See also: Sanders, Paul. The British Channel Islands under German Occupation 1940‚Äì1945, Jersey Heritage Trust 2005, pp. 240‚Äì248. The bailiffs of both Jersey and Guernsey were cleared of every accusation of being \\"Quislings\\" and collaborators. Both were given knighthoods for patriotic service in 1945.

Photos uploaded to the site were accessible as a layer in Google Earth and Google Maps. The site's goal was to allow Google Earth users to learn more about a given area by viewing the photos that other users had taken at that location. The website was available in several languages. Google acquired Panoramio in 2007. In 2009 the website was among 1000 most popular websites worldwide. Panoramio was launched in 2005, and closed on November 4, 2016, although the layer in Google Earth was available until January 2018. Image source URLs are still available. After the acquisition of Panoramio by Google, the headquarters were located in Zurich, in the office building of Google Switzerland, but subsequently were moved to Mountain View, California, US. History Joaqu√≠n Cuenca and Eduardo Manch√≥n, the creators of Panoramio. Panoramio was started in the summer of 2005 by Spanish entrepreneurs Joaqu√≠n Cuenca Abela and Eduardo Manch√≥n Aguilar. It was officially launched on October 3, 2005, and by March 19, 2007 it had archived over 1 million user submitted photographs. Three months later, on June 27, 2007 the number of photos reached two million. After a further four months, on October 25, 2007 the number of archived photos reached five million. In October 2006 Google began approaches to acquire the company, but these were rebuffed. However, on May 30, 2007 Google announced plans to acquire the website, and it was acquired by Google in July 2007. Manch√≥n left the company in January 2010 to focus on a new project. He was replaced by Gerard Sanz Vi√±as. Cuenca left the company in May 2010. In May 2015 the number of uploaded photos (including deleted objects) exceeded 120 million. By October 8, 2016, 94,370,531 photos had been uploaded by 4,159,004 users, resulting in a total of 75,640,891,592 image views. Further developments On September 16, 2014, Google announced that it intended to close Panoramio and migrate it to Google Maps Views. During the migration, features such as comments, favorite photographers and groups would disappear. On September 23, 2014, Panoramio's founders launched a petition entitled \\"Google: Keep The Panoramio Community Alive\\", requesting that Google refrain from closing Panoramio. It received 10,512 supporters. On June 2, 2015, Google announced that it would continue to operate Panoramio until a better solution could be developed. The announcement, by Google's James Therrien, stated: On January 30, 2016 another petition was launched by Stuart Smith, a Panoramio user from Australia, to request Google to maintain the site properly. It received over 1,500 supporters. On October 5, 2016 Google announced that they had decided to close Panoramio on November 4, 2016. Users were able to access their photos in Panoramio for a year, but were unable to add new photos, likes, or comments. Closure On 4 November 2016 Google removed all user facilities from the site apart from the ability to delete photos, connect/disconnect with Google+, and delete an account. Google said it left uploaded images on display for 12 months before Panoramio was completely retired. All other user facilities were removed on 4 November. At the time Google closed Panoramio, it had more than 94,370,531 pictures by more than 4,000,000 users. Organization Sample Panoramio page (of user 656563) exemplifying some of the mashup's options. Panoramio asked users to organize images using tags (a form of metadata), which allow searchers to find images concerning a certain topic such as place name or subject matter. Panoramio was also an early website to implement tag clouds, which provided access to images tagged with the most popular keywords. The website also hosted a list of world-famous sites. , 1 million photos were uploaded to the site in about 20 days. Images that had (or were perceived to have had) as their central subject people, machines, vehicles or anything within the interiors of structures, or depict public events such as fairs or concerts, were excluded from the Google Earth layer, as were any potentially controversial images. No waivers were granted even if the images were historical or otherwise vintage in nature, since copyright had to be held by the uploader. Images judged to be too creative or artistic in concept, such as Photoshop constructions, were also excluded from Google Earth regardless of other requirements met. However a pervasive problem was thousands of misplaced photos, typically manifested by cities and towns seemingly located in the oceans, which required action on the part of the photographer before anything could be done. Users could create and join Google Groups. Photos could then be added to a group. This feature was removed as part of the winding down of the site. Others Panoramio had an official iPhone app, which was deprecated in June 2012. Third party developers released a Windows Phone 7 version of Panoramio that allowed users to browse through the various images posted to www.panoramio.com. In response to the announcement that Panoramio would shut down, the photo-sharing service Mapillary announced that they were setting up a process for transferring one's Panoramio pictures to their service. They have since then published an online guide for this purpose.

The dairy was called \\"Rojek's Dairy\\", and Stan would assist his brother, Theodore, with the milk bottle and cream cheese deliveries. He died in his hometown at the age of 78. In dedication, he has a baseball field named after him in his hometown, North Tonawanda.

Controversy On March 3, 2010, 60 members of the All-Workers Militant Front irrupted inside the station's headquarters while its news bulletin was on air, to protest against the then-approved financial measures, that notably included the rise of the VAT at 2%, and the addition of a luxury tax to cars with value exceeding the 17.000 euros. What followed was a verbal conflict between the members and the station's owner. Meanwhile, the news bulletin would stop broadcasting, showing black instead.

His biggest success was with the band Love Affair, best known for the songs \\"Everlasting Love\\", \\"A Day Without Love\\", \\"Rainbow Valley\\" and \\"Bringing On Back the Good Times\\". Ellis later felt that Love Affair had run its course, and he left in December 1969 for a solo career: \\"We never really made it big anywhere but Britain and I think that if we had started to happen in America, I wouldn't have left\\". In the early 70s he formed the band \\"Ellis\\", a short lived partnership with keyboardist Zoot Money. Other members included ex-Peter Bardens guitarist Andy Gee; ex-Fat Mattress bassist Jimmy Leverton, later replaced by Nick South; and drummer Dave Lutton. The group released two albums, Riding on the Crest of a Slump in 1972, and Why Not? the following year. In 1976 one of the most popular Serbian and ex-Yugoslav bands, Smak, covered his song \\"El Doomo\\" under the title \\"El dumo\\", and achieved great success with it. Ellis subsequently had limited chart success with the rock band Widowmaker, releasing the album Widowmaker in 1976. Widowmaker toured the UK with Nazareth, and in June 1976 joined the stadium tour, The Who Put The Boot In opening for leading rock acts such as Little Feat, The Sensational Alex Harvey Band, Streetwalkers and the headline act The Who. He also sang on the soundtrack of Loot, a 1970 film based on Joe Orton's play, directed by Silvio Narizzano. Ellis was performing briefly with New Amen Corner during 2013 and had an album with Paul Weller and Roger Daltrey out on Decon Records in late 2015, entitled The Best of Days.

It consisted of Craig's television stations in Winnipeg, Calgary and Edmonton, and was the company's unsuccessful attempt to build a national network. CHUM Limited, which acquired Craig Media's television broadcasting assets in 2004 (resulting in Craig's re- incorporation to Craig Wireless), merged these stations into CHUM's flagship television system Citytv on August 2, 2005. On the same date, the A-Channel name was transferred to the NewNet stations in Southern Ontario and Vancouver Island, which are currently operated by Bell Media under the CTV 2 banner. The three original Craig Media A-Channel stations are now owned by Rogers Media. History A-Channel was first used by Craig Media as it sought to develop a national presence. Originally, Craig owned only two stations in Manitoba: CKX- TV, a CBC Television affiliate in Brandon; and CHMI-TV, an independent station (branded as the Manitoba Television Network, or MTN) in Portage la Prairie and serving Winnipeg. Looking to expand, Craig decided to counter CanWest Global's attempts to obtain licenses from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for television stations in Alberta, with a proposal it dubbed \\"The Alberta Channel\\", or \\"A-Channel\\" for short. During the first round of hearings in the early 1990s, neither company obtained a licence. However, after a second round in the mid-1990s, Craig won against CanWest. (CanWest later bought out Western International Communications and assumed control of its Alberta-based stations.) Craig launched A-Channel stations in Edmonton (CKEM-TV) and Calgary (CKAL-TV) in 1997. They billed themselves as very locally oriented stations whose programming decisions were made in Alberta and not Toronto. Their slogan was \\"Very Independent, Very (city name)!\\"--a slogan originally used at MTN. Programming included the local morning show The Big Breakfast, CityLine and Prime Ticket Movies, a brand initially used at MTN. MTN joined the A-Channel system in 1999. Craig established the A-Channel Production Fund which provided financing for made- in-Alberta television movies which A-Channel would air. The most notable of these was an adaptation of A Christmas Carol starring Jack Palance. In the late 1990s, Craig tried to expand the A-Channel network to other markets, either by acquisition or by pursuing new licenses. When Canwest purchased WIC, Craig attempted to force the company to resell WIC's Hamilton station CHCH-TV (as Canwest already owned CIII in the Toronto/Hamilton market). It also pursued stations up for grabs in Montreal (CFCF-TV) and Vancouver (CKVU-TV), and applied for a new licence in Victoria. All these attempts failed: Canwest was allowed to keep CHCH; Craig was outbid by other buyers for CFCF and CKVU; and CHUM won the Victoria licence (CIVI-TV). However, in 2001, the company's persistence seemed to pay off: The CRTC granted Craig a licence for a station in Toronto, CKXT-TV (known as Toronto 1), which was not officially part of the A-Channel system, but aired a similar program lineup and also adopted a similar logo. CKXT went on air on September 19, 2003. A-Channel Edmonton's employees went on strike on September 17, 2003 during negotiations for a first contract.Letter to local union presidents The labour dispute was resolved on February 14, 2004.A-Channel employees ratify new collective agreement On April 12, 2004, CHUM Limited announced a deal to purchase Craig Media for $265 million. The sale was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on November 19, 2004, and was completed on December 1. CHUM had to sell off Toronto 1, because it already owned stations in Toronto (CITY) and nearby Barrie (CKVR). Toronto 1 was sold to Quebecor Media, owners of the media units TVA and Sun Media. In February 2005, CHUM announced it would align Craig's A-Channel stations with its existing major- market stations under the Citytv name. No other significant changes were made, since the A-Channel stations' on-air look had always been very similar to that of Citytv. The change took effect on August 2 of the same year, when the A-Channel name was transferred to CHUM's NewNet stations. With the subsequent takeover of CHUM Limited in 2007, all three of the Craig Media's A-Channel stations were sold to Rogers Communications and are now owned by Rogers Media under the Citytv banner, while the former NewNet stations along with most of CHUM Limited's former assets were sold to CTVglobemedia in 2007 which was subsequently sold to Bell Canada in 2011 and are now owned by Bell Media branded as CTV 2. Programming A significant amount of the old A-Channel system's programming was subcontracted from CHUM, which did not have stations in the same markets. For several years before CHUM's acquisition of Craig Media, business analysts were already suggesting that some kind of merger between the two companies was likely, in part because of their already- established business relationship. The purchase of CHUM programming was diminished significantly following CKXT's launch, but increased following CHUM's purchase in the months prior to integration into Citytv. Original programming on the old A-Channel stations included the police reality series To Serve and Protect, the drama 1-800-Missing and the variety series Pepsi Breakout and MTV Select. Stations * Calgary/Lethbridge - CKAL * Edmonton/Red Deer - CKEM * Portage la Prairie/Winnipeg - CHMI CKXT in Toronto, then known as \\"Toronto One\\", carried most of the system's non-CHUM programming from 2003 to 2005.

Askatasuna (from the Basque word meaning \\"Freedom\\") is a Basque political party registered on 31 August 1998, outlawed in 2009 by the Audiencia Nacional under the 2002 Political Parties Law.http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/02/17/espana/1234899554.html History In 1998 several notable events occurred around the Basque nationalist left: the National Table of Herri Batasuna was jailed, the Pact of Estella was signed, ETA declared an indefinite truce and the electoral coalition Euskal Herritarrok presented itself to the Basque elections of the same year. Askatasuna was created that year by a small group of members of the Ezker abertzalea that feared the banning of the other political parties and organizations of the Basque national movement. Three years later, in May 2001, with a different situation since ETA had returned to commit deadly attacks, Askatasuna presented lists to the Basque elections in the three provinces. Askatasuna barely campaigned and won a very meager percentage of votes (0.05%). A month later, in June 2001, Euskal Herritarrok and Herri Batasuna created a new political party, Batasuna, which in March 2003 was outlawed by the Supreme Court according to a new law on political parties, that allowed the banning of those political parties that were against the democratic regime of liberties, supported violence and/or activities of terrorist groups. Despite the outlawing of Batasuna, Askatasuna continued to appear in the register of political parties and was in all respects a legal political formation, although since 2001 had not had any activity. This led some politicians and media communications analysts suggest that Askatasuna was being kept as a legal political brand that could eventually be used by Batasuna to present lists in future elections. In mid-January 2009, the press reported that Askatasuna wanted to participate in the Basque elections of 2009. The PP asked justice to monitor Askatasuna to see if it was the electoral brand of the outlawed Batasuna.http://www.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-pp-pide-vigile-si- askatasuna-puede-ser-partido-politico-pantalla-batasuna-20090117184906.html Askatasuna and Demokrazia Hiru Milioi (D3M)http://www.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-fiscalia-prepara-recursos- impugnar-listas-d3m-askatasuna-supremo-20090121181538.html were banned from the elections by the Supreme Court of Spain due to their alleged links to ETA and Batasuna.

The video grows more frantic and feverish as the song progresses, with the camera occasionally cutting to images of Nicholls and friends stumbling around the halls, destroying dressing rooms and break dancing in the toilets. During the video, a girl rushes up on stage to hug Nicholls, who he apparently throws over his shoulder.

Etymology It is unknown where the name actually came from but a local legend states that a man named Gilbert lifted an enormous stone to move the boundaries between his and another person's land so that he could gain more land. The supposed stone, which is an erratic from the Ice Age, is now kept at Blakesley Hall in Yardley.Gilbertstone Primary School: The Legend of Gilbertstone History Gilbertstone was shown as a separate entity to Yardley in John Ogilby's strip map of Coventry Road.Britannia, Plate 50, John Ogilby, 1675 Gilbertstone developed as a result of the construction of the now-demolished Gilbertstone House, which was built between 1866 and 1867 for Samuel Thornley,Images of England: Yardley, Michael Byrne, 1995, Tempus Publishing ()Report By British Association for the Advancement of Science, 1872 on the site of a small farmhouse.The Literary lounger, 1826, Lupton Relfe (London) It was bought by Richard Tangye in 1883, a major benefactor to the Birmingham Art Gallery. The house had extensive grounds which crossed into the area of Lyndon End and Bickenhill.Proceedings of the Royal Colonial Institute (Page 379), Royal Commonwealth Society (Great Britain), 1899 It had a pool with a boathouse. On the side of the house was a tall tower. It was recorded in 1905 that the mansion and grounds straddled the boundaries of the counties of Warwickshire and Worcestershire.Worcestershire Place Names, William Henry Duignan, 1905, H. Frowde Thomas Rowbotham lived in the house whilst developing the nearby roads. He gave land for the construction of St. Michael and All Angels Church, although that piece was exchanged for the site the church was actually built on. He also sold various pieces of land for development. Sir Hanson Rowbotham sold the estate for ¬£250,000 and the house was demolished in 1937. The estate was to be used for the construction of 3,000 houses, however, World War II suspended the construction of the properties on site.Land & Liberty, John Paul ‚Äì United Committee for the Taxation of Land Values (Great Britain), 1919, John Paul Visitors to the farmhouse and the manor on its site included John Bright,The Diaries of John Bright, John Bright, 1930, Cassell Catherine Hutton, William Hutton's daughter,Reminiscences of a Gentlewoman of the Last Century: Letters of Catherine Hutton, Catherine Hutton, 1891, Cornish and members of the Royal Colonial Institute. The area the estate covered is now crossed by Saxondale Avenue, which is the exact location of the house, Sunnymead Road and parts of Wensley Road, Brays Road and Wychwood Crescent. Manor House Lane reflects the former land usage of the nearby area. Moat Lane, bordering Gilbertstone, receives its name from one of the two moats in Gilbertstone, the remains of which can still be seen in Gilbertstone Recreation Ground alongside Moat Lane.Victor Henry Thomas Skipp, Medieval Yardley: The Origin and Growth of a West Midland Community, 1970, Phillimore & Company Ltd. The area was damaged by night bombing raids by the Luftwaffe during World War II. When the war finished, the area was developed as part of the postwar redevelopment. A new housing estate was built in Gilbertstone with 576 houses. 207 of these (36%) were designed by RIBA approved architects leading to criticism over the aesthetics of the area.Changing Suburbs: Foundation, Form and Function, page 84, Peter Larkham and Robert Harris, 1999, Spon Press UK () In 1950, Gilbertstone became home to a primary school, designed by Crouch, Butler and Savage in a typical postwar style.

Levi's lemma is named after Friedrich Wilhelm Levi, who published it in 1944. . Applications Levi's lemma can be applied repeatedly in order to solve word equations; in this context it is sometimes called the Nielsen transformation by analogy with the Nielsen transformation for groups. For example, starting with an equation xŒ± = yŒ≤ where x and y are the unknowns, we can transform it (assuming x ‚â• y, so there exists t such that x=yt) to ytŒ± = yŒ≤, thus to tŒ± = Œ≤. This approach results in a graph of substitutions generated by repeatedly applying Levi's lemma. If each unknown appears at most twice, then a word equation is called quadratic; in a quadratic word equation the graph obtained by repeatedly applying Levi's lemma is finite, so it is decidable if a quadratic word equation has a solution. . A more general method for solving word equations is Makanin's algorithm. Generalizations The above is known as the Levi lemma for strings; the lemma can occur in a more general form in graph theory and in monoid theory; for example, there is a more general Levi lemma for traces originally due to Christine Duboc. Several proofs of Levi's Lemma for traces can be found in The Book of Traces. A monoid in which Levi's lemma holds is said to have the equidivisibility property. The free monoid of strings and string concatenation has this property (by Levi's lemma for strings), but by itself equidivisibility is not enough to guarantee that a monoid is free. However an equidivisibile monoid M is free if additionally there exists a homomorphism f from M to the monoid of natural numbers (free monoid on one generator) with the property that the preimage of 0 contains only the identity element of M, i.e. f^{-1}(0) = {1_M}. (Note that f simply being a homomorphism does not guarantee this latter property, as there could be multiple elements of M mapped to 0.) A monoid for which such a homomorphism exists is also called graded (and the f is called a gradation).

He also studied watercolour and oil painting under the late Indonesian master artist Wakidi, in Bukittinggi. In 1947, this Minangkabau lad came to Singapore, where the Malay film industry was thriving. Here, he studied piano arrangement under Mr Concordio Soliano, and violin under Mr Raquiza and Mr Paul Soliano. He also learnt to play the saxophone and clarinet under Mr Paul Martinez.

Door security is used in commercial and government buildings, as well as in residential settings. Some strengthened doors function as fire doors to prevent or inhibit the spread of fire. Security devices=Alarms Alarms ‚Äî designed to warn of burglaries. Locks * Smart locks can be used to limit door access to only people with an electronic key fob or Near field communication device, like a smartphone. These devices are popular with landlords, who can enable and disable digital access without physically mailing out keys. The locks can log the times of entry, and can trigger an alarm if they are struck during a break-in attempt. * Deadbolts ‚Äî unlike common spring latches, the locking mechanism of these typically prevents the bolt from being retracted by force, or shimming, and it cannot be moved to the open position except by rotating the key. Reinforcement * Strike plate reinforcement can involve reinforcing the strike plate and/or the door frame, to prevent the strike plate from being rammed out of the frame. * Door reinforcements ‚Äî various products are made to prevent delamination and or splitting of the door. Sheet steel plate can be placed behind or under the deadbolt and wrap the door edge to prevent breaking the door around the deadbolt. Heavy duty products that place plates on either side the door tied together with screws or bolts can be used to prevent delamination. * Door chains ‚Äî allows the doors to be opened slightly to view outside while still remaining locked. * Secondary, internal locks ‚Äî sliding bolts, hooks and speciality latches, metal blocks or bars mounted internally. * Hinge screws ‚Äî longer or specialized screws that prevent the door from being simply pulled out after removing the hinge pins. Often the hinge pin itself is screwed, from the inside while the door is open, into the hinge to prevent removal of the hinge pin without first opening the door. Other methods Iranian door security * Burglar deterrent CD or MP3s ‚Äî home occupancy sounds recorded on a CD; the CD is played when the home owner is away, to mimic the home occupancy activities. * Door viewers ‚Äî small fish- eye lenses that allow residents to view outside without opening the door. * Door windows ‚Äî there are three common methods to add security to windows in or beside doors: security bars and grates, security films (coatings applied to the glass in windows to reinforce it), or breakage resistant windows (plexiglas, lexan, and other glass replacement products). * Visibility ‚Äî most police departments recommend the clearance of shrubs from near doorways to reduce the chance of a burglar being hidden from public view. Residential security=Common residential doors The following are the types of doors typically used in residential applications: solid wood door, panel doors (hollow and solid core), metal skinned wood-edged doors and metal edge-wrapped doors. Typically, door frames are solid wood. Residential doors also frequently contain wood. Steel doors with Multi locking system are recommended by construction professionals as important equipment in your security checklist. These type of doors few comes with wooden finish to maintain the wooden sentiment in their external appearance. Security tests by Consumer Reports Magazine in the 1990s found that many residential doors fail or delaminate when force is applied to them. Solid wood doors withstood more force than the very common metal skinned wood-edged doors used in newer construction. A broad range door manufacturer, Premdor (now Masonite) once stated in one of its 1990s brochures entitled \\"Premdor Entry Systems\\" page 6 that \\"The results of tests were overwhelming, Steel edged doors outperform wood-edged doors by a ratio of 7 to 1. When you consider the practically two- thirds of all illegal entries were made through doors... One hit of 100 lb [lbf] strike force broke the wood-edged stile and opened the door. To actually open the steel-edged door required 7 strikes of 100 lb pressure [force].\\" Most door manufactures offer a number of different types of doors with varying levels of strength. Consumer Reports Magazine also reported in its test results that door frames often split with little force applied and lower quality deadbolts simply failed when force was applied to the door. The Chula Vista Residential Burglary Reduction Project which studied over 1,000 incidents found that \\"methods found to have relatively low effectiveness included: sliding glass door braces, such as wooden dowels, as opposed to sliding door channel or pin locks; deadbolts installed in the front door only; and outdoor lights on dusk-to-dawn timers\\". Burglary tactics The Chula Vista Residential Burglary-Reduction Project yielded the following findings: \\"From victim interviews, we learned that in 87% of the break-ins that occurred when intruders defeated locked doors with tools such as screwdrivers or crowbars, the burglars targeted \\"the one door that had no deadbolt lock ... not one burglar attempted to break a double-pane window during the course of successful or attempted burglary.\\"  See also  * Access badge * Access control * Alarm management * Biometrics * Closed-circuit television * Electronic lock * ID Card * Keycards * Locksmithing * Lock picking * Magnetic stripe card * Security lighting * Surveillance * Window security ReferencesExternal links Category:Burglary Category:Doors ","title":"Door security"},{"id":"10814831","text":"The Kid Inside is the sixth studio album by American singer-songwriter John Mellencamp.

He had an elder brother, Frederick, and an elder sister, Alice Kathleen. After schooling at Giggleswick School to the age of 14, Charles was apprenticed as a plumber. He completed his apprenticeship and went on to work in the family woolen mill business during the 1920s. He spent some time in Belgium, at the associate company that worked with the woolen mill. In 1921, the family also acquired the Villa Walburg in the town of Epstein outside Frankfurt in Germany, at which they spent their annual summer holiday until its sale in 1933. Around 1919, George Henry Rycroft, in partnership with a Mr Hartley, purchased a rubber plantation in British Malaya at Perak; to the south south east of Penang. This plantation was named Harcroft (a portmanteau of Hartley and Rycroft). The eldest son Frederick Rycroft (1894‚Äì1984) was despatched to run the new business, but was recalled in 1922 after a business disagreement with his father. After about two years with a manager running the estate, who was finally sacked, Charles was dispatched to Malaya in 1924 to turn around the problems that had been caused.  Malaya  Charles soon established a large crepe rubber factory on the estate in order to add value to the raw latex. The crepe rubber was exported to be used mainly for shoe soles. Although the estate was relatively small, the factory purchased latex from surrounding producers and was one of the largest manufacturers of crepe rubber at the time. In 1936, going somewhat against the conventions of the time, Charles married Muriel Susan Elizabeth Parsons, a divorcee and secretary, and not part of the landed plantation community. Muriel and her first husband had accompanied Charles when he visited his parents in the Isle of Man in 1934. During the 1930s Charles, later with Muriel, travelled extensively in China and Japan, learning Mandarin in the process and even being invited once to play mahjong against Chinese leader Chiang Kai-Shek on a train journey to Shanghai. On the outbreak of hostilities with Japan in December 1941, the Rycrofts initially agreed to help with the war effort by housing 3,000 soldiers in the factory drying sheds and sending some of the workforce to help prepare an airfield away. However, by January 1942 Charles and Muriel had left the Harcroft Estate, fleeing to Singapore via Kuala Lumpar. Muriel was allowed passage on the last ship out of Singapore in February 1942, which took her to Colombo and then Bombay (now Mumbai). After a short period, she travelled onward to Cape Town, South Africa. She rented an unfurnished self-catering room at the Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel for the rest of the war. Charles had to remain behind and volunteered to help in the auxiliary fire brigade. The Japanese had not expected that they would capture Singapore and were therefore unprepared to run the city, meaning Charles was able to remain in the fire brigade for some months. Eventually, though, he was transferred to the Changi internment camp for civilians (next to the infamous Changi POW camp), where he remained until August 1945. Civilians were allowed one trunk of personal possessions, and Charles packed his trunk full of tinned and dried food, rather than the photos and personal items that most other inmates took. He also followed the advice of the camp doctor to eat the maggots in the food as an extra source of vital protein, rather than pick them out as others did. Due to these factors and good luck he was one of the relatively few who survived to the end of the war. There is a portrait of him by the Russian artist Vladimir Tretchikoff and fellow camp inmate showing his bearded and rather skeletal appearance at the end of the war. A Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith, similar to that which the Commissioner was killed in After release by Indian troops in September 1945, it took some time before Charles and Muriel discovered that each other were still alive and were able reunite in Cape Town, before returning to the devastated Harcroft Estate and factory in 1946. However, it was not long before Charles had everything re-equipped and back in production. Post war business was strong enough for him to purchase his first Rolls Royce in 1947. This car was similar to that of the British High Commissioner of Malaya. During the Malayan Emergency, Charles took the same road through a jungle as the Commissioner, but an hour or two beforehand, on 7 October 1951. Communist insurgents had planned to assassinate the Commissioner and mistook Charles' Rolls Royce for the official vehicle. As a result, the car was machine gunned, but the driver accelerated away and the occupants survived. The High Commissioner, Sir Henry Gurney, was not so fortunate and was killed when his convoy was brought to a halt by his wounded or dead escorts blocking the road.  South Africa  The guerilla incident convinced Charles that it was time to leave Malaya with the result that the estate was sold, and Charles and Muriel moved to Cape Town. Charles purchased the home of Duncan Baxter (donor of the funds used to build the Baxter Theatre Centre) on 8 March 1951 for ¬£25,000, and promptly renamed it Harcroft (as the Malayan estate had been). From then until his death he was officially retired, but in practice worked hard to manage his considerable investments, add to his collections of mostly oriental art, jade and ivory, and to run and embellish the of grounds around the house. Amongst the items he collected were two of the four official commemorative paintings done to mark the 1947 Royal Tour of South Africa. Following the accession of the anti-British National Party to power in 1948, the government of the Union of South Africa did not want the paintings. The other two belong to Cape Town City Council. Charles established a racing stud and was a regular visitor at South African Turf Club race meetings at the Kenilworth and Milnerton race courses. His greatest triumphs were with Prairie Prince winning the Somerset WFA Plate on Saturday 15 February 1969 (trainer J.W.Bell and jockey F.Heyman), the same on Saturday 14 March 1970 (trainer P.Kannemeyer, jockey P.Kruyer), and the Diadem Weight for Age Plate 1000 Metres on 5 December 1970 (trainer P.Kannemeyer, jockey G.Puller). He had previously won the Milnerton Turf Club Steward's Cup with 'Fighter' on 14 January 1961 (trainer J.W.Bell and jockey B.Doo). His wife Muriel died suddenly in August 1974, an event which was particularly traumatic for Charles. He married long time friend and widow Louise Jackson in 1981. During the 1980s, Charles became a friend of Gerald Durrell, and took an interest in the work of the Jersey Wildlife Trust. Charles donated approximately ¬£4m to finance the construction of a new centre in Jersey (including the Harcroft Lecture Theatre), sponsored conservation work in East Africa, and by the 1990s was supporting work on the preservation of the unique flora and fauna of Madagascar.  Philanthropy and death Since Rycroft's death from an infection after surgery to fit a pacemaker, the assets of his company (the Harcroft Trust Limited, registered in Jersey) have been administered by his former accountant and advisor Robin Rumboll. The company, now linked to the Harcroft Foundation, continued for a number of years to make donations to the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust. The foundation donated a little under ¬£200,000 in 2006 (according to the Durrell Wildlife Trust accounts), but also offered grants to other bodies. However, due to the expense of maintaining his widow Louise at the Harcroft Estate in Constantia, donations ceased. On his widow's death in 2014, control of the Harcroft Foundation, the Harcroft Trust Ltd and its wholly owned subsidiary Gefac Property Co. Ltd (owner of the Harcroft Estate) passed to Louise Rycroft's daughter Joan Misplon. In November 2019 Cape Town auctioneers Strauss & Co auctioned 558 lots of the contents of Harcroft, with the house, garden and 19 acres also put up for sale. The contents raised some 6 million rand.

The Ninja theme was adopted from the popular success of Five Element Ninjas (with the a similar introduction), which starred another Venom member Lo Mang. Plot In the 16th century,(In Ming Dynasty Era.) Japanese pirates terrorized the harbors of China for decades until General Chi Ching Kwong (Ti Lung) masterminded a naval task force to combat the invaders. The oppressive Japanese government sends a contingent of stealth Ninjas to assassinate the General in his palace. His son discovers that these killers have pledged their lives to eradicate his father. Soon Ninja assassins are attacking the General‚Äôs soldiers in order to get to him. General Chi Ching Kwong sends his son on a mission to recruit three Chinese anti-Ninjitsu fighters from the elder Master of Three Arts, who owes the General a debt. When the son establishes contact with the Master of Three Arts, the old one informs the General‚Äôs son that his three pupils do not know each other‚Äôs identity. The General‚Äôs son first meets up with the mischievous Chow Chun (Chiang Sheng) who he quickly enlists to the cause. Together they recruit the other student, a blacksmith named Tung Yen (Lu Feng). Chow Chun and Tung Yen are students of the same master, but don‚Äôt know each other and their philosophies cause them to fight playfully. Finally, the contingent adds the missing component to their team, that of weapons specialist, Mao Tin Yeung (Phil Kwok). Even as General Chi Ching Kwong‚Äôs son and his newfound allies return to the palace, several Ninjas have infiltrated the household disguised as servants. The General‚Äôs son then assigns each of his fighters to pose as servants as well, to catch any possible assassination attempts. Chow Chun is assigned to assist in the kitchens, to watch over the staff. He sees the lead cook load a deadly blade onto a tray and try to deliver it to the General for dinner. Chow Chun races out to the serving room and faces off with the Ninja assassin. General Chi Ching Kwong watches as his dinner is interrupted by this life or death battle. Next, one of the guards turns out to be an assassin, and is discovered by Tung Yen and soundly trashed. Mao Tin Yeung uses his wits to determine that the recent hiring of a palace maiden is indeed a female undercover Ninja. When he confronts her, she goes crazy and he is forced to fight her to the death. The leader of the Japanese Ninjas, Shi Ping Wei (Yasuaki Kurata) deploys a plan to kidnap the General‚Äôs son to lure the General‚Äôs bodyguards away from the palace where he will be unprotected. A band of sneaky Ninjas make off with the son, and hide him away in the nearby gardens. Chow Chun, Tung Yen, and Mao Tin Yeung unite and attempt to rescue the General‚Äôs son. Along the way, they are attacked by various bands of Ninja, including Tree Ninjas, Earth Ninjas, Sun Ninja‚Äôs. They finally fight their way past the Ninja horde, only to discover the General‚Äôs son is the prisoner of the sword-wielding Shi Ping Wei! The heroes must fight their way past this deadly swordmaster and his Ninja disciples if they are to rescue the General‚Äôs son...

When the Tuvan People's Republic was founded in the same year, the party held single- party control over its government as a vanguard party. History Under Soviet sponsorship, a conference of Tuvinian revolutionaries convened on October 29, 1921, and an organization bureau was formed. The first Congress met on February 28, 1922, when the Tuvinian \\"People's Government\\" was established. However, as soon as the Second Congress convened on July 6, 1923, the former party was dissolved because of Soviet dissatisfaction, and a new one was organized. The Fourth Congress met in October, 1925; the Seventh Congress, in 1928. The Central Committee was authorized to establish party cells and branches of the league of revolutionary youth throughout the country.Peter S. H. Tang. Russian and Soviet Policy in Manchuria and Outer Mongolia, 1911-1931. London: Duke University Press., 1959. p. 422. During the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the party in 1929 the right-wing leadership, which had intended to retain Tibetan Buddhism as a state religion in the old sense, in contradiction to the proclaimed constitution, was completely destroyed. Under the watchword of \\"antifeudal revolution,\\" the Eighth Congress paved the way for socialist reconstruction and collectivization. When, in April‚ÄìMay, 1930, the so-called \\"counterrevolution of the Tuvinian nobles and the Russian kulak-colonists\\" broke out with the intent \\"to overthrow the 'Revolutionary Government,'\\" it was also put down by force. Resolutions were adopted in the Central Committee of the People's Revolutionary Party to confiscate the property of the exploiter class, to conduct agricultural collectivization \\"on an unconditionally voluntary basis,\\" \\"to struggle for complete independence from the imperialist countries and to co-operate closely with the oppressed peoples and the working class of the whole world.\\"Malaia Sovetskaia Entsiklopediia (1st ed.), Vol. VIII, col. 989. Cited in Tang, p. 422. A prominent figure in its initial stage was Donduk Kuular. In 1929-1932 a political shift occurred, beginning with the 1929 Tuvan coup d'√©tat, as nationalist elements of the party, including Kuular, were purged. The leadership of the party was taken over by Salchak Toka. The party was admitted to the Comintern as a \\"sympathizing party\\" at its Seventh Congress in 1935.Jane Degras.

Playing career Originally recruited from Carlton Juniors, Topping made his debut for the Carlton Football Club in Round 10 of the 1902 season. Playing mainly in the forward line he was a good mark and accurate kick with a good sense of where to go to get the ball. His firepower was vital in Carlton's hat-trick of premierships from 1906-08 with totals of 25, 26 and 16 goals in those respective seasons. The following year the Blues were just beaten by South Melbourne in the grand final but Topping had his best scoring year with a total of 36 goals and playing in every match. The following the season the sides met in round four. It was a spiteful affair with fights erupting at regular intervals. Late in the final quarter South Melbourne defender Bert Streckfuss felled, struck unconscious. Field umpire, Lardie Tulloch promptly reported Topping, who was escorted from the ground by Carlton supporters who were either showing their support or for his own protection. At the subsequent tribunal hearing, Topping admitted that he had lost his head and struck Streckfuss in retaliation for Streckfuss's previous elbowing of Andy McDonald. The tribunal took a dim view of the incident and suspended Topping for the remainder of the 1910 season and all of 1911. There were further repercussions for both Topping and Streckfuss when they were called before the Carlton Court a fortnight later charged with assault. Found guilty, the bench decided to set an example and both were fined the maximum ¬£10, in default three months imprisonment. Topping returned for a single game in 1912, kicking Carlton's opening goal of the season and two more for the match. During the following week he sustained an injury and was not selected for round 2. Still on crutches in May, he took no further part in the season. Following an unsuccessful foray into umpiring Topping rejoined the Blues for 1914 kicking three goal against Melbourne in round one. The next week against Geelong he turned awkwardly after taking a mark and dislocated a bone in his ankle. He hobbled through remainder of the game but his season ended with the final siren. Reappearing in round two 1916 he kicked two goals and the next week against Richmond his final goal in his 125th and last match. Umpiring career Injured in 1912 Topping applied to become a field umpire with the VFL. He was accepted and placed on the senior list. Initially appointed to a number of country matches his first VFL appointment was Fitzroy v. Essendon in round five. He became the 67th field umpire in VFL history. The match seems to have been well enough handled, The Argus only critical of an advantage called back costing Essendon a goal. The Football record noted 'He severely penalised anyone holding the ball when caught.' In rounds seven and eight - played on the Saturday and Monday - he umpired both Essendon matches with seemingly few issues yet they were his final senior appointments. By July he was reported as back at Carlton having not been a success in umpiring although the Football record intimated Topping missed playing more than he expected noting, \\"Topping has had a go at field umpiring, and has come to the conclusion that it is better to play than to see that the other fellows play the game according to Hoyle.\\" Seven years after his last match as a player Topping again applied to join the VFL umpires and again was accepted. This time he stuck at it for longer and, despite not achieving senior matches, was more successful. His 15 VCFL matches in 1922 included two finals - the Heathcote grand final and the Peninsula Football Association second semi-final - and he returned the same total in 1923 with two more finals. Two matches in 1924 a month apart suggest the possibility of injury ending Topping's career with the whistle. His final totals were 3 VFL and 38 VCFL appointments.

It was first published in paperback by Ballantine Books as the fifty-first volume of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in August, 1972. It has been reprinted a number of times since, and gathered together with Walton's other Mabinogion novels by Overlook Press as the omnibus The Mabinogion Tetralogy in 2002. The novel has also been published in translation in several European languages. The other three novels in the series are The Island of the Mighty (1936), The Children of Llyr (1971), and Prince of Annwn (1974). The novel is a retelling of the story of the Third Branch of the Mabinogion, Manawydan Fab Ll≈∑r (Manawyddan, son of Ll≈∑r). Plot summary In the wake of the tragedy that befell the Children of Llyr, Prince Pryderi of Dyved returns to his realm with Manawyddan, the last survivor of the family. There Pryderi is reunited with his wife Cigfa and Manawyddan marries Pryderi's mother Rhiannon. An enchantment descends on the land, leaving it a wasteland empty of all domesticated animals and humans apart from the four protagonists. They support themselves by hunting at first, then move to the larger realm of Llogres where they make a living making saddles, shields and shoes. Their work is of such quality that the local craftsmen cannot compete, and drive them from town to town. Finally they return to Dyved and become hunters again. Pryderi and Manawyddan follow a white boar to a mysterious castle. Against Manawyddan's advice Pryderi goes inside, and does not return. Rhiannon goes to investigate and finds Pryderi clinging to a bowl, unable to speak. The same fate befalls her, and the castle disappears. Manawyddan and Cigfa return to Llogres as shoemakers, but are once again forced to leave so they return to Dyved. They sow three fields of wheat, but the first is destroyed before it can be harvested. The next night the second field is destroyed. Manawyddan watches over the third field, sees it destroyed by mice, and catches one of them. He decides to hang it for theft the next day. Three strangers turn up in succession to offer him gifts if he will spare the mouse. Manawyddan refuses. Asked by the third stranger what he wishes in return for the mouse's life, he demands the release of Pryderi and Rhiannon and the lifting of the curse from Dyved. The stranger agrees to these terms, and his captives are freed and the land restored. He reveals himself as Llwyd, an ally of Gwawl, whom Pryderi‚Äôs father Pwyll had beaten in order to get Gwawl to give up his right to Rhiannon's hand, which Gwawl had won from Pwyll by trickery.. The mice who destroyed Manawyddan‚Äôs crops were his attendants, magically transformed, and the one Manawyddan captured is Llwyd‚Äôs own pregnant wife. He had placed the enchantment on Dyved in vengeance for Gwawl‚Äôs beating and humiliation. Awards The Song of Rhiannon received the 1973 Mythopoeic Award for Best Novel.

The title may well be based upon Spring-heeled Jack, a semi-fantastical character from English folklore, alleged sightings and lurid press reports said to be able to make phenomenal leaps. The song features several samples from We Are the Lambeth Boys, a 1959 British documentary by Karel Reisz about the daily activities of members of the Alford House Youth Club, Kennington in late 1950s London. The dialogue excerpted is from two conversations, one about a fight between two groups of young men and another about the abolition of the death penalty. The lyrics of the song seem to be about a man who has gone through his life having lots of sex, but not 'slowing down' to embrace romance with one person. The lyric 'He'll \\"do\\" but never be \\"done to\\", as well as the usual crude sexual imagery common to Morrissey songs suggests the man refuses to let his lovers penetrate his emotional self. \\"Well it's the normal thing to do\\"; some men don't believe emotional intimacy is needed or something in their comfort zone so they have only shallow relationships. The song ends on its last verse with the man in old age wondering \\"where did all the time go?\\".

The museum's 25 exhibits have specific emphasis on the attractions that once existed at Playland at the Beach and the Sutro Baths & Museum. Included are numerous artifacts from the original Whitney's Playland at the Beach, including the giant clown's blue hat from the top of the Playland Funhouse, and Walking Charley, one of the original hand carved life- size wooden characters from the terrace above Laughing Sal in the front window of the Fun House. Thousands of historical items are present, from cases of never-opened books of Playland tickets to original signage, parts of rides and games, rare photographs, employee uniforms, and prizes from the Playland arcade games. Additionally, there are over 30 pinball games, carnival skill games, dioramas celebrating Halloween and the Yuletide season, and miniature circuses, including the Marcks Family Miniature Circus.  History  Playland-Not-At-The-Beach came into fruition in 2000 when El Cerrito businessman Richard Tuck purchased a building that had formerly been a grocery store. Tuck, an enthusiastic collector for the majority of his life, used the former store as a place to keep various objects he had acquired, including Playland artifacts. Upon hearing of his Playland relics, community members began to show an interest and volunteered to organize and catalog his collections. Tuck then made the decision to turn the building into a museum dedicated to fun. After eight years of design work and construction, Playland- Not-At-The-Beach opened on May 31, 2008. Playland-Not-At-The-Beach was featured on the local San Francisco television show Eye on the Bay on November 23, 2009. Just as Playland at the Beach closed on Labor Day in 1972, Playland- Not-At-The-Beach closed on Labor Day in 2018 after more than 10 years of non- profit community service.

It was released in the US as Lightning Kung Fu in June 1982. Although he had only a very small role in The Victim, former Peking Opera School student Yuen Biao played a key part in the making of this film. He was one of four action choreographers on the film, and doubled several of the stars for martial arts and acrobatics. Karl Maka, a frequent co-star with Hung in such films as Skinny Tiger, Fatty Dragon and Odd Couple, has an unusual deadpan role as a Shaolin abbot. Plot Chun-yau (Bryan Leung) was adopted as a little orphan boy by a humble rich man under one rainy-night who already had a mean young son. Chun-yau has developed into a fine kung fu fighter who is on the run with his newly-wedded wife Yuet-yee (Fanny Wang) from his step-brother Cho-wing (Chang Yi), whom is madly after his sister-in-law. The jealous son holds a grudge against his stepbrother because he blames Chun-yau for the loss of his eye (and now wears a jade patch over the eye). Now, Cho-wing has made it his goal to hunt down Chun-yau and his bride, prompting the newlyweds to spend their lives together running in fear from the gang leader. One fine day, Fatty (Sammo Hung) spots Chun-yau helping an old man from being crushed by a loaded-cart. Fatty challenges Chun- yau but is ultimately defeated. However, Chun-yau is not interested in becoming Fatty's master since he is more worried about his own domestic problems. Apparently Fatty has promised his ancestors that he shall learn proper kung fu by training under the man who beats him (and Chun-yau is the first to do so.). However, Chun-yau and his wife are trying to keep a low profile and they want nothing to do with Fatty, as all he does is attract attention. Fatty, meanwhile, can't help but wonder why such a great martial artist lives in fear. With his stepfather at death's door, Chun-yau and his wife go to pay final respects to his ill-struck adopted father. As Chun-yau enters his father's room, he finds himself surrounded by Cho-wing's men. They let Chun-yau speak with his stepfather as the old one expires. Cho-wing appears to be mourning the death of his father, but as soon as Chun-yau leaves his stepfather's room, Cho-wing orders his men to attack his stepbrother. Fatty arrives in time to help Chun-yau fight off the gang members. But Chun- yau's wife can no longer handle the pressures of life on the run and she begs Cho-wing to stop the violence and she will leave Chun-yau and live with him. Afterwards, she tells her husband she is sick of life on the run and that she will stay with Cho-wing. Chun-yau is shattered and leaves a broken man, followed by the faithful Fatty. But Yuet-yee really does not plan on spending her life with her hated admirer. After Cho-wing calls off the price on Chun- yau's head, Yuet-yee commits suicide rather than succumbing to his desires. After stealing the body of his wife and laying her to rest, Chun-yau finally begins training Fatty in the kung fu style his step father taught him, \\"The Iron Cross\\". During a training session, Fatty spots a gang member watching them from some tall grass so he tells his sifu and gets a knife to dispatch him. But to Chun-yau's surprise, Fatty stabs him instead, telling him that \\"He was a victim too\\". Later, after the gang member reports back, Fatty goes and collects the bounty on Chun-yau from Cho-wing, who is also holding Fatty's mother hostage. With money and mother in hand, Fatty has one more gift for Cho-winfi, which is Chun-yau, whom very much alive. He explains that once Chun-yau became his sifu, he told him everything. They came up with the plan to stage his death and getting Fatty's mother released. But as Fatty and his mother were leaving, gang members stabbed them both. Fatty's last words to his teacher and friend was to put his loyalty to his step father aside and avenge them. A final battle ensues between a hired expert in the Southern Eagle Claw and Chun-yau. After Chun-yau dispatches the hired expert and gives the gang members a good beating, they got the message and left the two brothers to handle their own business. The two brothers are evenly matched in fighting style till Chun-yau finally lets go of his rage and turns the kung fu match into a street fight leaving Cho-wing dead from being hurled into a building support column. Afterwards, Chun-yau paying respects at the graves of his wife and student. While there, a beggar looking a lot like Fatty shows up and asked about the deceased and their relations to him. As the beggar turns to leave, Chun-Yau realises who he is and runs after him.

Gardiner began his career with Melbourne, but only played two games for the Redlegs in 1905. Gardiner then made his debut for the Carlton Football Club in round 3 of the 1907 season. In his second season, 1908, Gardiner was part of Carlton's premiership winning team. He was also the club's leading goalkicker that season. Gardiner went on to win Carlton's leading goalkicker award six more times and win another premiership, in 1915. He left the Blues at the end of the 1917 season. Early in 1918 Gardiner joined the hundreds of thousands of other Australians who had enlisted to serve in World War I. While training at Broadmeadows Army camp, his instructors described him as \\"steady and reliable,\\" \\"capable and attentive\\" and \\"keen and hard-working\\", but the war ended before Gardiner was called up for active duty. Gardiner was made a life member of Carlton in 1949. He also played cricket for Carlton, appearing in 109 first XI matches between 1905/06 and 1923/24.

The underpinning is provided by an algebraic definition of the free partially commutative monoid or trace monoid, or equivalently, the history monoid, which provides a concrete algebraic foundation, analogous to the way that the free monoid provides the underpinning for formal languages. The power of trace theory stems from the fact that the algebra of dependency graphs (such as Petri nets) is isomorphic to that of trace monoids, and thus, one can apply both algebraic formal language tools, as well as tools from graph theory. While the trace monoid had been studied by Pierre Cartier and Dominique Foata for its combinatorics in the 1960s, trace theory was first formulated by Antoni Mazurkiewicz in the 1970s, in an attempt to evade some of the problems in the theory of concurrent computation, including the problems of interleaving and non-deterministic choice with regards to refinement in process calculi.

Church The church was built in the 17th century in the form of a central nave with two side chapels. The walls are made of stone and clay and are supported by exterior arches of unmortared stone. The floor is brick with a central band of stone. Originally there was no choir. A choir without railing was built later-on whereas one of the most interesting frescoes of the area, the Last Judgment was destroyed. The atrium is surrounded by a clay wall on which are situated several figures made of red stone: A bishop, lilies, phalli and others. The square tower was rebuilt in 1789 and painted with white lime. Noteworthy are the frescoes in the interior which were painted in water colors by Indians in the Andean baroque of the 17th century. The Last Judgment suggests that only women were condemned. The archangel St. Michael weighs a nude woman on a scale and there are trails to get to the purgatory, over clouds to heaven as well as stairs to the mouth of a dragon which leads to hell, where there are several torture instruments. The condemned women walk or are dragged by the hair or are ridden by demons. One of them leads the helpers of evil with a broad smile, not knowing what awaits her.

At its height, some 180 kehillot existed throughout the country.History of the NIK (see History section) NIK.nl. Accessed 21 April 2007 Disappeared Communities At the eve of the Holocaust, some 140 Jewish communities existed throughout the Netherlands, many of them located outside of Amsterdam and the Randstad. At the end of the war, with some 75% of Dutch Jews murdered in the Nazi concentration camps, many of these communities disappeared. Some prominent Jewish communities in the Mediene who were totally destroyed by the Nazis include: * Apeldoorn (1,030 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, community merged with the Jewish communities of Deventer and Zutphen in 2000) * Winschoten (493 Jewish inhabitants in 1940, community abolished in 1964) * Zandvoort (372 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, community merged with the Jewish community of Haarlem in 1947) * Dordrecht (322 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, community merged with the Jewish community of Rotterdam in 1987) * Meppel (304 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, community merged with the Jewish community of Zwolle in 1964) The Great Synagogue of Deventer. Numbering 442 persons in 1930, this Jewish community in the mediene was largely destroyed during the Holocaust. It eventually merged with two other Jewish communities, those of Apeldoorn and Zutphen, in 2000. * Veendam and Wildervank (283 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, community merged with the Jewish community of Stadskanaal in 1948) * Gouda (223 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, community merged with the Jewish community of Rotterdam in 1964) * Hoogezand-Sappemeer (222 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, community abolished in 1948) * Rijssen (207 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, community abolished in 1948) * Stadskanaal (142 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, community merged with the Jewish community of Groningen in 1988) * Pekela (140 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, community merged with the Jewish community of Stadskanaal in 1948) * Borculo (139 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, community merged with the Jewish community of Winterswijk in 1980) * Beverwijk (135 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, community merged with the Jewish community of Haarlem in 1947) * Delfzijl (134 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, community abolished in 1947) * Lochem (125 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, community abolished in 1947) * Sittard (125 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, community abolished in 1947) * Heerlen (120 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, community merged with the Jewish communities of Maastricht and Roermond in 1986) * Dieren (114 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, community abolished in 1950) * Groenlo (105 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, community abolished in 1950) Other Jewish communities in the Mediene greatly declined because of the Holocaust (note: Jewish inhabitants are counted on affiliation to the local Jewish community/communities): * The Hague (10,605 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, 284 Jewish inhabitants in 1998) * Rotterdam (10,515 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, 246 Jewish inhabitants in 1998) * Groningen (2,408 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, 53 Jewish inhabitants in 1998) * Arnhem (1,389 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, 70 Jewish inhabitants in 1998) * Leeuwarden (733 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, 45 Jewish inhabitants in 1998) * Assen (581 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, 51 Jewish inhabitants in 1998) * Nijmegen (450 Jewish inhabitants in 1930, 30 Jewish inhabitants in 1998) The tremendous decline and disappearance of dozens of Jewish communities throughout the Netherlands was not only due to the large numbers of Dutch Jews killed during the Holocaust, but also due to large-scale post-Holocaust emigration to countries like Israel and the United States, and migration within the Netherlands from the Mediene to Amsterdam.

Plot Rain takes place in a town loosely inspired by mid-twentieth century Paris, and follows a young boy. In the opening of the game, he is stuck in bed at home with a fever. During the day he stares out of his window and sees an invisible girl in the rain who is given form by the rain casting a silhouette around her. She stares at him for a brief second before being chased away by something huge and menacing that is also invisible unless the rain gives it a form. Curious, he follows the two down an alleyway, whereupon exiting through a pair of large doors, the day suddenly turns to night and the town is now deserted, occupied only by strange invisible beasts that roam the streets. The boy also realises that he himself is invisible, and that he and the beasts are only given form by the rain. With the way back closed, he attempts to find the girl, who is still pursued by the beasts; the one the boy saw from his window is referred to as the Unknown. Using any means to shelter from the rain, the boy evades the creatures that prowl the streets and alleyways, yet the girl proves ever elusive. After missing his chance to meet the girl at a church that's under renovation, the boy follows her into the grounds of a disused factory and finally makes his presence known to her. They escape together, but neither is able to hear the other's voice. Regardless, they continue on through the town while being pursued by the Unknown. As the game progresses, the children become aware that each has a visible doppelg√§nger asleep in their respective homes. The girl attempts to awaken her other self, and while doing so begins to become visible again. But before she can wake her doppelg√§nger up, she is chased away by the Unknown. The boy follows, and upon exiting her house, discovers that the town has completely restructured itself into a castle maze-type layout that is afloat on water with no end in sight. He eventually reunites with the girl and the two flee from the ever-pursuing Unknown. Drawn to a strange light at the edge of the Unknown‚Äôs domain, the two arrive in an alleyway with the light seeping in through the very doors they had passed through when entering the world of the night. Exposure to the light suddenly weakens the Unknown. Seeing this the children open both doors, causing the Unknown to collapse upon the ground. However, they realise they cannot leave as without the rain, they have no physical form. Instead they resolve to drag the Unknown into the light beyond the door at the cost of trapping themselves in the world of night. After they close the doors, the Unknown pushes the door open as he dies and collapses onto the boy, pinning him. Unable to free him, the girl abandons him and heads straight to his home. There she yells at his window in hopes to awaken him. She succeeds, but as the boy becomes visible, the girl is left trapped and alone. As with the beginning of the game, the ending is illustrated with watercolour painted stills. The boy awakens in his bed the next morning and immediately sets off across town, retracing his steps to the girl‚Äôs home. Standing outside below her bedroom window he attempts to awaken her the way she awoke him, and the girl finally appears on her bedroom porch. The game ends with the two reuniting on the street outside the girl's house underneath a rainbow. Gameplay Rain is an adventure game which is centred around the novel mechanic of invisibility. The player takes on the role of a young boy who is invisible and can only be seen when standing in the pouring rain. When under canopies, bridges and awnings outside, and also while sheltered indoors, the boy cannot be seen by the player themself nor the enemies that inhabit the world, and can only be tracked by his watery footprints. The invisibility mechanic applies not only to the player's character but also to all enemies within the game. The player utilizes the visibility of the boy, and other creatures, in the rain to solve various puzzles and tasks throughout the game. Music The game's theme song is \\"A Tale Only the Rain Knows\\" which is set to the tune of \\"Clair de Lune\\" by Claude Debussy from Suite bergamasque, and is arranged by the game's composer Yugo Kanno and sung by Connie Talbot. Reception The game has received positive reviews in its release. It received an aggregated score of 72/100 on Metacritic based on 77 reviews. Daniel Krupa of IGN rated the game a 7/10, praising some of the game's mechanics but said \\"Rain creates a distinctive heartbreaking atmosphere, but fails to develop it into a more engrossing experience.\\" Tom Mc Shea of GameSpot gave the game a 7.0 as well, praising the gameplay, music and some of the puzzles, saying \\"Rain uses chilling atmosphere and a heartfelt story to draw you in to this fantastical world\\", but criticized some of the mechanics of the puzzles. Brittany Vincent of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 3/5, saying \\"There's the potential for a beautiful journey here, but Rain seems to be too content to wallow in its melancholy to create any real engaging gameplay.\\" Philip Kollar of Polygon gave the game an 8.5, stating \\"Rain pulls strong emotion out of its simple mechanics.\\" Christian Donlan from Eurogamer rated the game a 6/10, while praising its lighting and atmosphere, he criticized the poorly-paced story and the repetitive plot, as well as the game for not being challenging. He called the game \\"a missed opportunity\\".

It links Piazza Oberdan, on the northern edge of the city centre, with the village of Villa Opicina in the hills above. The tramway is currently out of use, following an accident in August 2016, with a replacement bus service operating. Reopening of the line has been postponed until February or March 2020,a deadline set by Trieste city council. When in use, for most of the journey the line operates as a conventional, electrically powered tramway, with a mixture of street running and reserved track. On the steepest section of the line, between Piazza Scorcola and Vetta Scorcola, the trams are pushed uphill and braked downhill by a pair of cable tractors that operate on funicular principles. The line forms part of the network of Trieste Trasporti, the public transport provider for Trieste.  History = As a rack and adhesion line  Although the Austrian Southern Railway first arrived in Villa Opicina in 1857, the Villa Opicina railway station was situated some distance from the village, and the local topography forced a circuitous railway route between Opicina and Trieste. As a result, various projects were promoted to link the two places more directly, resulting eventually in the construction of the Opicina Tramway by the Societ√† Anonima delle Piccole Ferrovie di Trieste. The line was opened in 1902, and as built incorporated a rack railway section between Piazza Scorcola and Vetta Scorcola. Conventional four-wheel tramcars operated the full length of the line, being assisted up and down the rack section by three small rack locomotives. In 1906 the line was extended at its top end from the village of Villa Opicina to Villa Opicina station, a distance of .  As a hybrid funicular and tramway  In 1928 the rack railway section was replaced with a funicular section, and the rack locomotives by cable tractors. However, the original four-wheel trams continued running until 1935, when they were replaced by new bogie cars. The extension to Villa Opicina station was closed in 1938. After nearly 60 years of private ownership, the line was taken over by the municipality of Trieste in 1961. The line has been modernised several times over the years, most recently in 2005‚Äì2006 and 2012‚Äì2014. However, it still uses four of the five 1935-built tramcars, supplemented by two similar cars built in 1942. Two of the original four-wheel cars have survived, and one sees occasional use as an operational museum car. New unmanned cable tractors were provided during the 2005‚Äì2006 rebuild, which are remotely operated by the tram drivers. August 2016 accident On 16 August 2016, trams 404 and 405 were involved in a collision at the passing loop at Conconello on the upper section of the line. Both cars were badly damaged, whilst eight passengers and both drivers were injured, with six requiring hospital treatment. With only three cars in operational condition, service on the line was suspended and replaced by a bus service. The two damaged cars were repaired by early 2017, and in December 2017 the regional council granted ‚Ç¨3 million to restore the tramway.http://m.ilpiccolo.gelocal.it/trieste/cronaca/2017/12/12/news/dalla- regione-tre-milioni-per-il-tram-trieste-opicina-1.16230127 The line is still not operating. Two of the cars are in the open air in the depot yard, while a third remains abandoned in the street in Trieste where the dummy is engaged. A platform and turning circle for the bus 2 and 2/ have been constructed at Villa Opicina station. The bus pauses at the tram depot to allow a ticket to be purchased at the bar adjacent to the depot.  Route  Tramcar 402 at the recently rearranged Piazza Oberdan terminus.

Car 401 at Obelisco on the upper section of the tramway. Opicina tram depot, 29 July 2003  Description  The line has a total length of , and climbs from just above sea level in Trieste to a height of in Opicina. The line is of , and is single-tracked with eleven intermediate stops and four passing loops. The terminus in Piazza Oberdan has two tracks, although only one is normally used. Between Piazza Oberdan and Piazza Scorcola, a distance of some , the line runs in the street along the Via Martiri Della Libert√† through a built-up urban area. From Piazza Scorcola to Vetta Scorcola, a distance of , the funicular section runs on its own right of way. The cable-hauled section is long and climbs a vertical distance of with a maximum gradient of 26%. At its foot is a short stub siding that permits the cable tractor to be parked off the running-line. In the middle of the funicular section, at Romagna, is the first passing-loop, used in normal service. Whilst the line below the loop is single track, the final 120 metres or so of the loop below Vetta Scorcola is laid as very closely spaced double track, allowing each cable tractor to use a different track. The longer upper section, from Vetta Scorcola to Villa Opicina, is mostly on roadside reservation or private right-of-way in open rural country. There are three passing-loops on this section, although only the one at Conconello is used in normal service, with the loops at Cologna Campo Sportivo and Campo Romano used only if extra services are running. The terminus at Villa Opicina is flanked by a five track depot. Services The line forms part of the network of Trieste Trasporti, the public transport provider for Trieste, and is line 2 of that company's system. When running, services are operated every 20 minutes from early morning (07:00) to early evening (20:00).  Stops  From the Trieste end of the line, the line serves stops at: *Piazza Oberdan (terminus) *Piazza Scorcola *Sant' Anastasio *Romagna *Vetta Scorcola *Cologna Campo Sportivo *Cologna Chiesetta *Conconello *Banne *Obelisco *Campo Romano *Via Nazionale *Villa Opicina (terminus)  Equipment = Tramcars  Interior of a service car. Older generation cable tractor waiting for a tram to Opicina at Piazza Casali, Trieste, 29 July 2003 One of the latest generation of cable tractors, braking a descending tramcar. The line is operated by six steel-bodied four-axle electric tramcars numbered 401-402 and 404-407. Cars 401-405 were built in 1935 by Officine Meccaniche Stanga with Tecnomasio Italiano Brown Boveri electrical components. Cars 406-407 were built in 1942 by the same companies to a similar design, although war-time shortages resulted in a more basic interior and different window detail. Car 403 was subsequently destroyed in an accident on 28 November 1975. The cars take electricity from a 550 Volts DC overhead line. Each car is long, wide and high, with 50 seats and a total carrying capacity of 120 passengers. They have four motors, giving a maximum speed of , and are equipped for rheostatic braking, in addition to air brakes, electro-magnetic track brakes and hand brakes. Two of the original wooden-bodied four-wheel tramcars still exist. The original car 1 was built in 1902, at Graz in Austria, by Grazer Waggonfabrik with electrical components from √ñsterreichische Union- Elektrizit√§tsgesellschaft. On the arrival of cars 401-407, it was converted into a works car numbered 411. In 1992 it was restored to its original condition and sees occasional service as a museum car. Car 6 has also survived and been recently restored, having been displayed as a static exhibit at the railway museum in Trieste Campo Marzio station.  Cable tractors  On the funicular section of the line, the tramcars are pushed uphill and braked downhill by cable tractors, also known as cable dummies or, in Italian, carro scudo. These vehicles are permanently attached to the haulage cable. They are not coupled to the tramcars; gravity holds the lower end of the tramcar against the upper end of the cable tractor. There have been three generations of cable tractors on the line. The first generation of cable tractors was introduced in 1928, and had long box-shaped bodies. These cars were replaced in 1978 by two new vehicles, manufactured by Fuji Electric. These had a very different appearance, with only a short control cabin in the centre of the long chassis. Both these first two generations of cable tractor were operated by their own driver, separately from the driver of the tramcar. In 2005, a third generation of unmanned cable tractors was introduced. These tractors are operated remotely by the drivers of the tramcars. Without the need for a cabin to accommodate a driver, these new cable tractors are low-profile vehicles, and thus do not obstruct the vision of the tramcar driver or the passengers when running downhill with the tractor leading.

Plot Hired killer 'Minute Fong' is so-called throughout the kung fu world for his ability to beat an opponent in under a minute. With such an effective technique, Fong naturally gains an unnerving reputation throughout China. The killer is beginning to rethink the actions of his life though and sees the next few jobs as definitely being his last. After his girlfriend commits suicide, he finds his priorities in life changing even though his employer, Chow Sau-tung, promises him rich rewards for obedience. Fong agrees to take one final assignment; to kill a man named Lai in a specified town. The obvious catch is that the town is inhabited by scores of men with this name and therefore the assassin must carefully search out his target. While staying in the designated location, Fong befriends a local boy who proves to be a mischievous, yet good-hearted youngster who is merely looking for a father figure. Over time, the supreme fighter agrees to teach the boy kung fu so that he can defend himself and the rest of his family. As the master-student bond develops, so does the friendship between Fong and the youngster's mother and grandfather. Fully immersed in this ordinary life, the killer forgets his assignment, but is quickly reminded of it when he discovers who Lai really is.

He married Martha Drew in 1903. Football Mick Grace was a follower/forward who started his career at the top level in the VFA in 1895 with Fitzroy, joining his older brother Jim. Grace was part of Fitzroy's premiership team in that season (although no Grand Final was played in the VFA at the time). In 1897, Fitzroy was one of the eight clubs to form the VFL as a breakaway competition from the VFA, and in 1898 and 1899, Grace was part of back-to-back VFL premierships with the Maroons. He was regarded as the best player on the ground in the 1898 Grand Final. Grace was part of the Maroons' 1900 losing premiership side, then retired from playing.Blueseum Profile.

Plot Prince Tsoi (Hwang Jang Lee) is the cruel lord of the Ching regime. He has earned his high rank by using his Lohan Fist techniques to destroy the Ming rebels, who, in turn have targeted Prince Tsoi for assassination. Enter Shao Hai (Meng Hoi), a naive kung fu scholar who earns a living by acting as a janitor for the local Shaolin Temple. The monks here apparently don't take their positions too seriously, as they spend their days bullying Shao Hai instead of praying or practicing the martial arts. Shao Hai lives with his Aunt who adopted him, and learns the martial arts from his drunken master Uncle (Chien Yuet San, doing his best Sam the Seed routine), formerly a head monk of the local temple. The day Prince Tsoi comes to the temple, Shao Hai watches the arrival from the roofs above. He sees incognito rebel assassins about to attack Prince Tsoi, and yells out to the Prince to take cover. Upon hearing Shao Hoi's warning, the guards leap into action and chase off the rebel offenders. Prince Tsoi then shows his gratitude towards Shao Hai for potentially saving his life. Prince Tsoi (who really doesn't like Shao Hai) allows the young man to think he has gained favor with the Ching. So this immediately goes to the head of Shao Hai and he goes around alienating those around him. Meanwhile, Shao Hai's Uncle asks him to spy on Prince Tsoi to determine which form of martial arts he practices. When Shao Hai informs his Uncle that the Prince practices Lohan style, he convinces Shao Hai to ask Prince Tsoi to teach him this super secret form of kung fu. The Prince is suspicious of Shao Hai's desire to learn Lohan Fist, but agrees because he sees the kid as a pawn of the rebels. In short time, Shao Hai learns Lohan and Buddhist Fist techniques. He finally gets to apply these skills when masked rebel assassins penetrate the palace security to kill the Prince. He beats off the assassins, and manages to kill one. When he removes the mask of the dead rebel, Shao Hai goes into shock when the assassin is none other than his Aunt who adopted him. Shao Hai now realizes that he is on the wrong side of this conflict. He goes to seek the advice of his Uncle, who recruits him into the rebellion, something that his Aunt firmly believed in. The Prince's advisors warn him that someday Shao Hai could become a potentially great opponent with Lohan Fist training. But the Prince still plans to use Shao Hai to expose the underground. Over time, Shao Hai becomes more knowledgeable with the Lohan techniques, and begins to train his Uncle. The Prince finally catches on about whom Shao Hai is, and demands he send his Uncle to the palace to face him. After the two fight to a standstill, the Prince's guards interrupt the fight, giving the Uncle the opportunity to escape. The angered Prince Tsoi organizes a search party to track down and kill Shao Hai and his Uncle. Meanwhile, both men have hidden themselves in the forest where Uncle begins training his nephew in the ways of the Buddhist's Palm; the only know method of counteracting the Lohan Fist. After undergoing training of the Five Elements Buddha's Palm techniques, the enlightened Shao Hai returns to the palace to challenge his opponent. He fights through Prince Tsoi's bodyguards to finally engage the Prince himself. Shao Hai must defeat the Prince not only to avenge his aunt's death, but in the name of freedom itself...

V. Reddy. Shot simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil, the film was produced by Aluri Chakrapani and B. Nagi Reddy under the banner Vijaya Vauhini Studios. It was co-written by Kamalakara Kameswara Rao and features N. T. Rama Rao, S. V. Ranga Rao and K. Malathi in the lead roles. The film focuses on a gardener's son who has to amass wealth equal to that of the king of Ujjain to marry his daughter, and a sorcerer who has to sacrifice an intelligent and brave young man to Goddess Pathala Bhairavi to gain access to a statuette which can grant any wish. Pathala Bhairavi is based on Kasi Majilee Kathalu, written by Madhira Subbanna Deekshitulu, though it was also partially inspired by the story of Aladdin. As the film is shot as a bilingual, production lasted for a whole year starting from 5 February 1950 until 8 February 1951, . Ghantasala composed the film's music and Marcus Bartley served as the cinematographer. The film was edited by the duo C. P. Jambulingam and M. S. Money, while Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were the film's art directors. The Telugu version of Pathala Bhairavi was released on 15 March 1951, and the Tamil version on 17 May 1951. Both versions were commercially successful, with the Telugu version becoming the first in its language to have a direct run of 200 days. It is considered to be a breakthrough film for both Rama Rao and Ranga Rao, and was also the only South Indian film to be screened at the first International Film Festival of India held at Mumbai on 24 January 1952. On the centenary of Indian cinema in April 2013, CNN-News18 included Pathala Bhairavi in its list of \\"100 greatest Indian films of all time\\".  Plot  The queen of Ujjain is keen for her daughter Indumathi (alias Indu) to marry her brother Surasena, a timid and mentally unstable person. When the gardener's son 'Thota' Ramudu assaults Surasena at a concert for irritating the common people, he is summoned by the king to the court. His boldness leaves a considerable impression, but when Ramudu declares his love for Indu a day before his death sentence for meeting Indu secretly, the king is reminded of the astrologers' prediction that only a brave man can save her from a wicked sorcerer. He then challenges Ramudu to amass wealth equal to that of his to marry Indu, to which Ramudu agrees. He is released from prison. Ramudu meets a Nepali sorcerer during the latter's magic show in a street. The sorcerer, who is ordered by Goddess Pathala Bhairavi during his prayers to sacrifice an intelligent and brave young man before her to be granted a statuette which grants any wish, feels that Ramudu is suitable for the sacrifice. While taking a holy bath in the nearby pond, Ramudu kills a crocodile that immediately transforms into a woman after being killed. The woman informs Ramudu that he had freed her from a hermit's curse and also reveals the sorcerer's intentions. Just before the sacrifice, Ramudu sacrifices the sorcerer and wins the statuette, consequently amassing the wealth equal to that of the king. In return, the king lives up to his promise and accepts Indu's wishes to marry Ramudu. The sorcerer's apprentice Sadajapa discovers his master dead at Pathala Bhairavi's shrine and brings him back to life with the help of Sanjeevani. Upon resurrection, the sorcerer makes a deal with Surasena, who was about to commit suicide, to bring the statuette in exchange of everything Ramudu has, including Indu. Surasena agrees and steals the statuette, then handing it over to the sorcerer which changes the fate of Ramudu and Indu, leaving the former penniless. Ramudu pledges to bring Indu his wealth back and leaves for the sorcerer's lair along with his cousin, Anji. While they are unable to locate the sorcerer's lair, Indu refuses the sorcerer's proposal to marry him. With the help of the statuette, the sorcerer brings Ramudu to his lair and tortures him in front of Indu with a hope that she would succumb to his proposal to marry him. Posing as Sadajapa, Anji requests the sorcerer to shave his beard to win Indu's heart. The sorcerer shaves his beard, losing his powers in the process. Afterwards, Ramudu finds the statuette and wishes to bring the palace back to Ujjain. In a fight between Ramudu and the sorcerer mid-way in the sky, the latter is killed by Ramudu. The palace is back in Ujjain and Surasena apologises to both Ramudu and Indu before uniting them. While Anji marries Indu's best friend, the film ends with the marriage of Ramudu and Indu.

Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani of Vijaya Vauhini Studios signed K. V. Reddy later in the year to make a folklore film. The film, Pathala Bhairavi, was based on a story from Kasi Majilee Kathalu, written by Madhira Subbanna Deekshitulu. Pingali adapted the content and wrote the film's story. Kamalakara Kameswara Rao and Reddy worked on the screenplay. Pingali was also inspired from the story of Aladdin. Pathala Bhairavi was made as a bilingual film, shot in Telugu and Tamil simultaneously with both the versions having the same title. The Tamil version's dialogues were written by Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass. T. Prakash Rao, who went on to make his directorial debut with Palletooru (1952), worked as an assistant director for the film. K. Viswanath also joined the film's crew as an assistant director, along with K. Raghava as the film's action choreographer. Marcus Bartley was recruited as the film's cinematographer and the duo C. P. Jambulingam and M. S. Money edited the film. Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were the film's art directors. Ghantasala composed the film's music.  Casting  Initially, director Reddy had Akkineni Nageswara Rao in mind for the lead role. He later wanted to cast Raja Reddy in the lead role but replaced him with N. T. Rama Rao in the last minute, who made his debut by playing a minor character in Mana Desam (1949). Rama Rao was eventually signed as a part of his four-film contract with Vijaya Vauhini Studios after Reddy was impressed with Rama Rao when he met him on the sets of Samsaram (1950). With this film, Rama Rao became the first actor to have acted in two languages simultaneously. Mukkamala was initially considered for the role of the sorcerer, the film's antagonist. But with Rama Rao being signed as the protagonist, Reddy wanted to cast an actor without an image, thus S. V. Ranga Rao was signed. Ranga Rao wore costumes reminiscent of a Shakespearean anti-hero and used the catchphrase \\"Sahasamsayara Dimbhaka\\" (Be adventurous man). He took inspiration from Shylock, the antagonist of Shakespeare's play, The Merchant of Venice, which he played when he was a stage-artist. Muthudhuta Peethambaram, who joined Vijaya Vauhini Studios in 1945, helped Ranga Rao take on the appearance of a 105-year-old man with the use of make-up. Malathi, who had earlier acted in Reddy's Bhakta Potana (1942), was signed to play the female lead role Indumathi, the princess of Ujjain. Girija played the titular role of goddess Pathala Bhairavi. Relangi and Balakrishna were signed to play supporting roles; the former playing the role of the brother-in-law of Indumathi's father played by C. S. R. Anjaneyulu and the latter playing Rama Rao's sidekick. Padmanabham was signed to play a supporting role as well. Savitri did a short dance sequence in the film.  Filming  Pathala Bhairavi was the first big budget film produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios. The entire production lasted for a whole year starting from 5 February 1950 until 8 February 1951, due to the film being shot simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil. Pasumarthi Krishnamurthy conducted the choreography for the song sequences. Major portions of the film were shot in large sets and many trick shots were used by Bartley during the process. Both versions were filmed using an Arri 11 CBR Camera. For scenes in the film that featured the moon in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit to make it look like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, as a source for lighting.  Themes  According to K. N. T. Sastry in his book Alanati Chalana Chitram, the film begins with the theme of Dhairye Sahase Lakshmi (Bravery gives wealth) which is present throughout the film. While the characters of Rama Rao and Ranga Rao epitomise heroism, the character of the princess played by Malathi epitomises innocence and sensuality. Pathala Bhairavi sets up an opposition between the worship of Rama by the protagonist's mother and the worship of Pathala Bhairavi by the sorcerer; the former being a frequent one inhabited in a domestic space while the latter being an uncivilised one. According to Azim Premji University liberal studies faculty member S. V. Srinivas, Pathala Bhairavi was a blend of folklore and social drama. Srinivas stated that the depiction of the goddess Pathala Bhairavi before Ramudu sacrifices the sorcerer was reminiscent of the representation of Poleramma worship by dalits in the film Mala Pilla (1938). He added that Pathala Bhairavi \\"ratifies certain social relationships by presenting them as natural and given\\" and \\"at the same time, some other practices are presented as inhuman and uncivilised\\".  Music  The soundtrack of Pathala Bhairavi was composed by Ghantasala, the lyrics of which were written by Pingali and Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass for the Telugu and Tamil versions respectively. The sound mixing process was supervised by A. Krishnan and Siva Ram. It was processed by N. C. Sen Gupta and was orchestrated by A. Krishnamurthy. The songs were composed using Mohana, Bhimpalasi and Sindhu Bhairavi ragas, with \\"Prema Kosamai Valalo Padene\\" and \\"Kanugona Galano\\" notably being modulated on the same raga. The soundtrack was released on 1 December 1950. Also, a digitally remastered version was released and marketed by HMV in 2003; the album cover depicts a still image from the film featuring Rama Rao and Malathi. Relangi sang the comedy song \\"Vinave Bala Naa Prema Gola\\" which was filmed on himself. A costly Hammond organ was specially imported for this film which was played by Master Venu. For the Hindi dubbed version, T. G. Kamala Devi sang the song \\"Sunloji Sardaro\\" (\\"Ithihasam Vinnaara\\" in Telugu) and Jikki sang the song \\"Bindiya Chamke\\" (\\"Vagaloi Vagalu\\" in Telugu). The latter became the first Telugu film singer to record a song for a Hindi film with this Hindi dubbed version of Pathala Bhairavi.  Release  Theatrical release poster of the Tamil version The Telugu version of Pathala Bhairavi was released on 15 March 1951, and the Tamil version was released two months later on 17 May 1951. Both versions were commercially successful, with the Telugu version completing a theatrical run of 100 days. Pathala Bhairavi became the first Telugu film to run continuously for 175 days, and the first Telugu film to have a direct run of 200 days. It completed the 175th day of its theatrical run in a total of 13 theatres. S. S. Vasan acquired the film's Hindi dubbing rights and reshot two song sequences ‚Äì \\"Ithihasam Vinnara\\" and \\"Vagaloi Vagalu\\" in colour. The Hindi dubbed version was commercially successful. Pathala Bhairavi was the only South Indian film to be screened at the first International Film Festival of India held at Mumbai on 24 January 1952. Sahitya Surabhi organised a programme at the Visakha Public Library in Visakhapatnam on 7 March 2015 on the eve of the 64th anniversary of this film's release and writer Rambhatla Nrusimha Sastry attended the programme as the chief guest.  Critical reception  Pathala Bhairavi received critical acclaim. A. Seshagiri Rao of Zamin Ryot writing his review on 16 March 1951 called Pathala Bharavi a landmark film, not just for Telugu cinema but for Indian cinema as well. He praised Reddy's direction and observed that the team spirit of the cast and crew in making this film was visible. On 4 April 1951, Andhra Patrika opined that Pathala Bhairavi was a film made intelligently, and compared the story to that of a train which runs tirelessly without halting for a second. While praising the character of the Nepali sorcerer and Ranga Rao for his portrayal, the reviewer criticised the film for poorly developing the other characters, in contrast to Shavukaru. In his 1988 book One Hundred Indian Feature Films: An Annotated Filmography, Srivastava Banerjee gave a polarised review of the film by calling it \\"an extraordinarily meaningless modern myth\\".  Cancelled plans of digitisation and colourisation  In late November 2007, a Hyderabad-based company named Goldstone Technologies acquired the film negative rights of 14 Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, including Mayabazar (1957) and Pathala Bhairavi, to release their digitally re-mastered versions in colour. After the success of the digitised and colourised version of Mayabazar released in January 2010, its makers announced that Pathala Bhairavi would be the next film to be remastered and re-released in colour. However Goldstone Technologies decided not to remaster the remaining 14 films including Pathala Bhairavi, saying that most of the producers who sold the rights of the negatives to TV channels lost control over them, adding that there were also a lot of legal issues over ownership and copyright issues whenever other producers try to do something on their own.  Legacy and impact  Pathala Bhairavi achieved cult status in Telugu cinema; in July 2010, Hemanth Kumar of South Scope called Pathala Bhairavi a film that \\"took an entire generation by storm\\" and praised its special effects in particular, which Kumar felt were ahead of their time. The lines \\"Nijam Cheppamantara Abaddham Cheppamantara\\" (\\"Shall I say the truth? or shall I lie?\\"), \\"Sahasamsayara Dhimbaka\\" (\\"Be adventurous man!\\"), \\"Naruda Yemi Nee Korika\\" (\\"O Human, what you want?\\") became popular and phrases such as \\"dingari\\" (\\"servant\\") and \\"dimbhaka\\" (\\"fool\\") later became a part of Telugu vernacular. The film's story is regularly staged as a play by Surabhi theatre group, known as Sri Venkateswara Natya Mandali. During a programme Telugu Cinema Prasthanam organised by the film society of Vishakhapatnam, writer include actor Ravi Kondala Rao placed Pathala Bhairavi among other cult films like Raja Harishchandra (1913), Bhakta Prahlada (1932), Mala Pilla, Devadasu (1953) and Lava Kusa (1963) during a speech on the role of Telugu cinema in the hundred years of Indian cinema. On the centenary of Indian cinema in April 2013, CNN-News18 included Pathala Bhairavi in its list, \\"The 100 greatest Indian films of all time\\". Rana Daggubati (left) and Raghu Babu (right) as artistes from Surabhi theatre group performing a play based on Pathala Bhairavi in the film Krishnam Vande Jagadgurum (2012). The film is considered to be a breakthrough film for both Rama Rao and Ranga Rao. Rama Rao later starred in other folklore films like Chandirani (1953), Rechukka (1954) and Jayasimha (1955); all of which were commercially successful. When the film's unit was travelling by train to attend the 100th day celebrations of Pathala Bhairavi at Bellary, the then Union Home Minister C. Rajagopalachari was travelling in Madras Mail. When both the trains happened to halt at Guntakal, people who had come to greet Rajagopalachari rushed to the other platform to have a glimpse of the film's unit, which left Rajagopalachari amazed by the popularity that the film had attained. Pathala Bhairavi inspired Vijaya Productions along with its collaborator Chandamama to produce Bhairava Dweepam (1994) directed by Singeetam Srinivasa Rao starring Rama Rao's son Nandamuri Balakrishna in the lead along with Roja. In the pre-climax sequences of the Telugu film Okkadu (2003), when Obul Reddy (played by Prakash Raj) is about to murder Ajay (played by Mahesh Babu), the latter compares the former with Ranga Rao's character in Pathala Bhairavi who was murdered by Rama Rao's character. Clip from 02:27:20 to 02:27:55. The film's story was used as a play in the Telugu film Krishnam Vande Jagadgurum (2012), which was based on the Surabhi theatre group.

WTGO-LP broadcasts at an effective radiated power of 100 watts. The station's studio and offices are located at 724 Wabash Avenue in Lafayette,with a tower facility located on South 30th Street in Lafayette. History WTGO-LP was founded by Harvest Chapel Pastor Tom Camp,Harvest Chapel the father of Christian contemporary musician Jeremy Camp. It began broadcasting in late 2003, taking a Christian rock format in 2005. It was also the first low power FM station to be licensed to the Greater Lafayette area. Programming WTGO-LP was originally engineered and managed by Andrew Longman who left in August 2004. In 2005 Matt Whatley was brought on board as both an audio engineer and WTGO-LP's Station Manager. In March 2005, Robert Schueler was brought on initially to help with the technicals of building an off-site studio and later becoming the PM and then AM and PM host of the \\"Bob- Squad\\" show, which lasted from May 2005 to April 2007. Whatley left the station in May 2006 and Schueler took over as Station Manager and DJ. Schueler left WTGO-LP in April 2007. With the addition of Brett Estes as Program Director in August 2007, the program format was revamped to more of a rock/metal sound. Estes also hosted \\"The Rock\\" Morning Show. Estes left WTGO in May 2010. Truth Talk with Tom was a show that aired live at 11:30 AM on Tuesday and Thursday. It was also re-aired the same day at 6PM. The hour long talk show was produced live in the studio. The show thrived off of questions from listeners who call or email questions and comments about life, the Bible, Christianity, God, etc. The show featured Tom Camp, the pastor of Harvest Chapel (owners of WTGO-LP), and Brett Estes the stations morning show host and program director. Other guest who have made appearances on the show are Trent O'Brien, the afternoon DJ, Ryan Harrison (the church's youth pastor), Eric Hollingsworth, and Jeremy Camp (Tom's son.) The show was canceled in April 2010. Christian Hardcore and Christian Heavy Metal was aired on Friday and Saturday nights from 10-midnight (hosted by Spike Chiquet as well) including the syndicated The Full Armor of God BroadcastThe Full Armor of God Broadcast but the shows were canceled due to a change of the station's music format and the final episodes aired January 23, 2010. WTGO-LP's Sunday programming format is lighter musically and includes more worship songs. The station expects an exemplary and verifiably Christian lifestyle of its staff. In terms of its music, WTGO thoroughly reviews each song's lyrical content and overall message before adding it to the rotation and attempts to ensure that both the songs of bands that perform and their personal lifestyles are exemplify the values held by the station. On May 8, 2009 WTGO-LP began broadcasting online. Shortly after that they developed an iPhone app which is a free download and allows the user to stream the station, and make request through a phone call, text message, or email.

January 1997. The submarine ridge and Hut Point Peninusula temper the effect of McMurdo Sound ocean currents. Current meters indicate such minimal currents that the bay can be considered essentially stagnant. In addition the submarine ridge tends to provide a buffer against icebergs moving into the bay and damaging the ice pier and shoreline. Physical barriers created by such land forms have also concentrated toxic pollutants introduced into the bay from operations at McMurdo Station, according to a 1997 U.S. National Science Foundation sponsored study. The combination of sun and sufficiently warm air temperatures a few days during midsummer can produce snowmelt on adjacent Ross Island. The subsequent runoff is largely diverted by ditches and culverts into McMurdo Sound, rather than the bay, according to the National Science Foundation report. Harbor pollution Scientific and support operations at McMurdo Station, beginning with its construction in 1955, have led to severely polluted waters at Winter Quarters Bay. Until 1981, McMurdo Station residents simply towed their garbage out to the sea ice and let nature take its course.

The Upper Rhine High Command was formed on 26 November 1944 and deactivated on 25 January 1945. The sole commander of this headquarters unit was Heinrich Himmler. Although English language sources refer to this command as an \\"army group,\\" the German term Oberkommando actually means \\"high command\\". As such, the Oberrhein command was not an army group subordinated to theater command, but a command of importance equal to that of a theater command and one which reported directly to Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) and Adolf Hitler. The German term Oberrhein refers to the upper reaches of the Rhine River, the geographical area for which this command had defense responsibility. Creation Following successful Allied offensives in November 1944 that forced the Saverne and Belfort Gaps, reached the Rhine River, and liberated Belfort, Strasbourg, and Mulhouse, Hitler ordered the German troops around Colmar in Alsace to hold fast. German Army Group G (Heeresgruppe G) was stripped of defense responsibility for the area around Colmar and the defense of the Rhine River south of the Bienwald. On November 26, 1944, the Germans organized the Upper Rhine High Command to defend the upper Rhine.Georg Tessin. Verb√§nde und Truppen der deutschen Wehrmacht und Waffen-SS 1939-1945. Die Waffengattungen - Gesamt√ºbersicht. Chapter \\"I. Oberbefehlshaber\\", p. 5.Schramm, p. 419, (translated) \\"On this day, all Army, Air Force, and Waffen- SS troops from the south edge of the Bienwald to the Swiss border are placed under the command of the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS and given the mission to prevent a crossing of the Rhine by the enemy. In support of this, all Volkssturm will be mobilized. Reports from the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS will be made directly to the F√ºhrer.\\" Hitler placed SS Reichsf√ºhrer Heinrich Himmler in command on December 10,Clarke and Smith, p. 485 believing that Himmler's presence would stimulate extraordinary efforts by both German military and Nazi Party officials in the region. The designation of the command as a \\"High Command\\" also meant that the Upper Rhine High Command was an independent theater-level command that answered directly to OKW, rather than to the OB West. OB West was the German command responsible for the rest of the Western Front. With Himmler in charge of the Upper Rhine High Command, the practical effect was that this army group answered directly to Hitler. This introduced a largely disadvantageous schism into the German high command for operations on the Western Front. Organization The Upper Rhine High Command controlled the German Nineteenth Army as well as several regiments of the German Replacement Army (Ersatzheer) that were mobilized by Military District V (Wehrkreis V) as an emergency measure in reaction to the successful Allied offensives of November 1944. The battle for Alsace On December 16, 1944, the Germans attacked in the Ardennes. What became known as the \\"Battle of the Bulge\\" forced the movement of large numbers of U.S. troops north out of Alsace and Lorraine to counter the German attack. In January, additional U.S. troops were moved north in response to the German counter-offensive into northern Alsace, Operation North Wind (Unternehmen Nordwind). Taking advantage of the stretched Allied lines, Himmler ordered the recapture of Strasbourg. German troops assaulted across the Rhine near Gambsheim on January 5, 1945Clarke and Smith, p. 513 and soon occupied a bridgehead including the towns of Herrlisheim, Drusenheim, and Offendorf north of Strasbourg. South of Strasbourg, German troops in the Colmar Pocket attacked north toward Strasbourg on January 7, inflicting painful losses on the French II Corps, but were ultimately unable to break the French defense. Reinforced by elements of the 10th SS Panzer Division, the German troops in the Gambsheim Bridgehead held their own against U.S. and French counterattacks during January 1945, manhandling the U.S. 12th Armored Division at Herrlisheim. The German successes of January, however, marked the high point for the Upper Rhine High Command. The Gambsheim Bridgehead, and further to the south, the Colmar Pocket, would not be reduced by Allied forces until well into February 1945, but the operations of the Upper Rhine High Command after mid-January were defensive in nature. Inactivation With the defeat of Operation North Wind and the impending collapse of the Colmar Pocket, the Upper Rhine High Command was inactivated on January 24, 1945, and the responsibility for the defense of the upper Rhine region was again returned to Army Group G.Clarke and Smith, p. 548 The staff of the Upper Rhine High Command was used to staff the newly formed Eleventh SS Panzer Army on the Eastern Front. Heinrich Himmler was sent to command Army Group Vistula (Heeresgruppe Weichsel), also on the Eastern Front.

In truth, the cartel had already murdered his wife and two young children, and planned to kill Jeff after he succeeded in delivering their drugs. The drugs are delivered and the White Hand sets Jeff up to be killed in a car bombing in Las Vegas, but Jeff's instincts kick in and he is only slightly injured in the blast, and the cartel thinks he is dead and gone. Jeff then finds out that his family was wiped out and breaks down. A short time later, the FBI wants to get him back to work, but Jeff has begun planning his revenge against the White Hand. Officially censured but unofficially aided by concerned agent Megan (Kristen Meadows), whose mother was raped and murdered years ago, Jeff steals some FBI files and kicks off his cartel extermination campaign by killing Vitch in Las Vegas, at Vitch's casino.

Although Megan is captured and taken away in a helicopter, Jeff momentarily flees. Angered by Kowalski's accurate descriptions of him as a sadistic creep, Manta shoots and kills Kowalski at his complex, but endures a savage beating from Jeff who is able to rescue Megan.

In October 1944 he was shot down by anti-aircraft fire, captured on landing and sent to the air force officers' prison camp, Stalag Luft III, in eastern Germany. In January 1945 he was transported to Stalag IIIA at Luckenwalde which was liberated two months later by the advancing Russian forces. He reached the singles final of the 1947 and 1951 French Championships but lost to Hungarian J√≥zsef Asb√≥th (6‚Äì8, 5‚Äì7, 4‚Äì6) and Jaroslav Drobn√Ω (6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì3) respectively. In 1947 he won the doubles competition with countryman Eustace Fannin. In 1948 he reached the singles final at the U.S. National Championships but lost to American Pancho Gonzales. In 1947 and 1948 he won the British Hard Court Championships played in Bournemouth. He won the first three Swedish Open tournaments (1948, 1949, 1950), played in B√•stad. Sturgess won a record 11 singles titles at the South African Championships between 1939 and 1957. By the end of his career Sturgess had reached fifteen Grand Slam finals (three in singles, six in doubles and six in mixed doubles). He won four titles (the 1947 French Championships doubles title, the 1949 French Championships mixed doubles title and the 1949 and 1950 Wimbledon mixed doubles title).

Her work is geometric and abstract, seemingly simple but very precise to reflect the mathematical concepts she strives to concretize. \\"I wanted very much to see the equations I was studying, so I started making them in my studio,\\" she has said. \\"I was visually solving equations.\\" Rockburne's attraction to Mannerism has also influenced her work. In 1950 she moved to the United States to attend Black Mountain College, where she studied with mathematician Max Dehn, a lifelong influence on her work. In addition to Dehn, she studied with Franz Kline, Philip Guston, John Cage, and Merce Cunningham. She also met fellow student Robert Rauschenberg. In 1955, Rockburne moved to New York City where she met many of the leading artists and poets of the time. She was influenced by the minimalist dances of Yvonne Rainer and the Judson Dance Theater. Throughout her career, she created paintings that expressed mathematical concepts. In 1958, a solo show of her work was critically and financially successful but deemed \\"not good enough\\" by Rockburne herself. She did not publicly show her work again for more than a decade, turning her attention to dance and performance art by 1960. Rockburne participated in performances at the Judson Dance Theater and took classes at the American Ballet Theater. During that time she supported her daughter, Christine, by working as a waitress and a studio manager for her friend Robert Rauschenberg. Bykert Gallery, in New York, which also represented Chuck Close and Brice Marden, began showing her work in 1970. Rockburne‚Äôs series of installations, Set Theories, included works such as Intersection, which attempted to merge two of her other pieces of art (Group and Disjunction) to illustrate the mathematical concept of intersection. The series later led to her experimentation with new concepts and materials, such as Gold Section and carbon paper. In 2011, a retrospective exhibition of her work was shown at the Parrish Art Museum in Water Mill, N.Y., and in 2013, the Museum of Modern Art hosted a solo show of her drawings. Rockburne is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, National Academy of Design, and The Century Association. In 2016, Rockburne was the recipient of an honorary degree from Bowdoin College.

It is located at 91.9 MHz on the FM dial. WJEF broadcasts in stereo with an effective radiated power of 250 watts. The station's studio and offices are located at Jefferson High School's William S. Fraser Radio/TV Center in Lafayette, Indiana with a tower facility behind the school off South 18th Street. The station also webcasts the off-air signal 24/7. Programming Jeff 92 features an eclectic mix of oldies from the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s. During the school day, WJEF features student DJs as well as news reports. In addition, WJEF carries Jefferson High School's Boys' basketball games, and all home and away football games. The station is automated when school is not in session. History On January 7, 1972 the station signed on with a regular broadcasting schedule using the callsign WJJE. The station was the creation of Jefferson High School's teacher Bill Fraser. WJJE's original format was a middle of the road (MOR) format. In the spring of 1985 the format was changed to Adult Contemporary. By the end of 1985 the regular use of albums as a music delivery system ended. In the fall of 1987, the station changed its slogan identifier to \\"Easy Rock 91-9\\" in attempt to update the image. The Adult Contemporary format remained until the fall of 1991 when the station switched to an oldies format and changed its slogan identifier again, this time to JEFF 92. In October 1996 a 1000 watt stereo transmitter was installed replacing the original 25-year-old model. It wasn't until almost 2 years later that the control room was completely rewired and a new audio board, speakers, and furniture were installed to prepare for the new millennium. In May 1999 the station sign-on time changed from 7:15 AM to 7:00 AM and the station remained on the air each weekday during the school year until 4 PM. In May 2000 automation equipment arrived and the process of recording music onto the automation computer's hard drive began. In September of the same year, JEFF 92 began an expanded broadcast schedule, staying on the air each school weekday until 11 PM. On January 8, 2001, JEFF 92 began broadcasting 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The following school year, in addition to all home football and boys' basketball games, JEFF 92 began carrying all away games as well. In September 2002, the Radio-TV center was officially renamed The William S. Fraser Radio-TV Center in a ceremony honoring founder and educator, Bill Fraser. In June 2003, a new ON-AIR automation computer replaced the older unit that had been in service for almost 3 years allowing for more music in the rotation. Almost a year later, in May 2004, WJEF founder William Fraser died. In September 2004 all Jefferson High School sporting events carried by the station became available on the Internet, both as live broadcasts and in archive form. However, this only lasted during the 2004‚Äì2005 school year. In December 2004 after 32 years of service, the station's FM antenna atop the 100 foot tower behind the school was replaced. In April 2005, WJEF began webcasting 24/7 from a senior project by student Vince PeGan. In May of that year the first $500 William S. Fraser Scholarship Award was given to senior Vince PeGan. After nearly a year of work by WJEF staffers, the station moved to an entirely digital music collection.

The show is a sequel to the 2006 series Northern Lights (a spin-off of the Christmas special Christmas Lights), and a prequel to the 2008 TV film Clash of the Santas. Plot As in the previous series of this show, Green and Benton play Colin Armstrong and Howie Scott, two best friends since childhood who are married to two sisters, Jackie (played by Nicola Stephenson) and Pauline (played by Si√¢n Reeves). The series commences with the two friends being the only witnesses to a gangland shooting, and after the police fail to catch the culprit, and the families' houses are set alight, the families are forced to go on the witness protection programme, which relocates them to London. They are forced to change their names, with Colin choosing Brad Shearer, a reference to Newcastle United player Alan Shearer, and Howie choosing the name Duncan Carr, not realising he didn't have to stick to the suggestion list. He requests a change of name but it's too late. He decides to get people to call him by his middle name which is Wayne but then realises that it now sounds like the curse word 'wanker'. It is also revealed that Pauline is having an affair with a workmate, although Howie is oblivious to this. This develops later in the series as, separated from her lover, she develops an attraction the police officer who first dealt with their case, DS Tate, failing to realise that he is being blackmailed by the criminal who is after the two families, Sweeney, who has bought up his gambling debts. As the tensions between the two families worsen, Colin and Howie make numerous accidental references to others that reveal their true names and origins. Both of their relationships with their wives also become estranged, after it is revealed that Colin was married prior to marrying Jackie, yet never revealed the fact to her. Howie is also in trouble as he was best man at the wedding and also failed to disclose the fact to Jackie or Pauline. While Jackie forgives Colin, Howie and Pauline's relationship seems to be over after she disappears without trace, spending the day with DS Tate, unaware that he is revealing her location to Sweeney. However, DS Tate changes his mind and decides not to take her to an agreed meeting place with Sweeney. Pauline phones Howie to tell him that their relationship is over, unaware that her call is being listened to by the police, who believe that she has been kidnapped. Pauline then spends the night with Tate, giving him the opportunity to read her address from a piece of paper in her handbag. Meanwhile, Howie and Colin become traffic wardens, and Colin accidentally gives his influence David Ginola a parking ticket. Partially as a result of this, they resign their positions as traffic wardens and Colin buys a large quantity of gardening equipment, proposing that they set up a landscape gardening business. After discovering that Pauline is having an affair, Howie trails her to a hotel where she is with DS Tate, however, they are caught and kidnapped by Sweeney's thugs. They are taken before Sweeney, who demands they return the drugs they 'stole' from him. Howie and Colin lead Sweeney's thugs on a false trail to find the drugs. The Police find out that the person Pauline has been contacting is DS Tate, and immediately interrogate her about it. Meanwhile, Sweeney's thugs take Howie and Colin back to Sweeney's caravan, where DS Tate is waiting for them, ready to shoot them both. DS Tate, Howie and Colin escape after fooling Sweeney's thugs into thinking Tate actually shot them (He poured tomato ketchup over them to make it look like blood). One of the thugs kills the other, and claims that he will make it look like the thug and Tate shot each other - \\"After all, you were shagging the big guy's wife.\\" Howie and Colin hear this, attack the thug and take his gun, before bundling him into the back of a nearby car. They drive to the airfield where Sweeney is about to leave in a plane, and mistakenly stop the wrong plane, however, the police arrive and stop the plane carrying Sweeney. Tate is arrested for conspiring to kidnap, and Colin and Howie return to the safe house. However, Colin collapses and it transpires that after Sweeney's thug kicked him earlier, he had a ruptured spleen. Colin thinks he's been given the 'snip', however, it is explained that he had a splenectomy and is not able to have the 'snip'. Jackie reveals that she is pregnant and Colin and Howie decide to stay in London.

He is currently the head football coach at Brevard College. Early life Khayat attended York Catholic High School in York, Pennsylvania, where he was a three-sport letterman. In baseball, he was an All-County catcher. In basketball, he was the starting center for the 1990 State Champion Fighting Irish. In football, Khayat was a First Team All- State tight end and was selected to play in the Big 33 game. His jersey (No. 30) was retired in 1991. In 2002, Khayat was inducted into the York Catholic High School Sports Hall of Fame. Playing career=College Khayat attended and played college football at Duke University as a tight end from 1992-95. He was twice named to the All-Atlantic Coast Conference second team and was an honorable mention All-America choice in 1994. Khayat became the first Duke tight end to lead the team in receptions in 25 years. He also set records for receptions (11) and yards (109) in the 1995 Hall of Fame Bowl. Khayat finished his college career with 105 receptions for 1,155 yards and seven touchdowns. Khayat earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biological Anthropology and Anatomy from Duke in 1995. He was on the Dean's List with Distinction at Duke and was named to the Academic All-ACC Football team. Professional After going undrafted, Khayat was on the practice squads of the Kansas City Chiefs (1996) and the Carolina Panthers (1997), and in 1998 he played for the Barcelona Dragons of NFL Europe.Bill Khayat Career Statistics - The Football Database Coaching career Khayat was previously at Tennessee State University for four seasons as the school's tight ends coach and video coordinator (2000‚Äì02) and running backs coach and recruiting coordinator (2003). During his two stints at TSU, he coached three players in two different positions who earned All-America honors: running back Charles Anthony (2003) and tight ends Steve Farmer (2001) and A. C. Leonard (2013). Khayat then spent three seasons with the Arizona Cardinals (2004‚Äì06) as offensive quality control coach and assistant offensive line coach. From 2007-2009, he served as the offensive quality control coach and assistant tight ends coach for the Washington Redskins. Khayat went on to coach two seasons in the United Football League as the tight ends coach and assistant offensive line coach for the Sacramento Mountain Lions (2010‚Äì11). Soon after, Khayat accepted the role as the offensive coordinator and tight ends coach for the North team at the Players All-Star Classic in Little Rock, AR (2012). Khayat accepted the same responsibilities for the East West Shrine Game in St. Petersburg, FL (2013). In 2014, he was a tight ends coach and assistant offensive line coach for the NFLPA Collegiate Bowl in Carson, CA and was a tight ends coach again in the 2015 game. In 2015, he was named the run game coordinator and tight ends coach for the Utah Stand of Major League Football, a proposed professional spring league that never launched. In 2016, he was selected as the head coach for the Tropic Bowl in North Miami Beach, FL, where he also was the offensive coordinator, the quarterbacks coach and tight ends coach. He spent the 2016 season as the running backs coach and assistant special teams coach at Scottsdale Community College. In January 2017, Khayat was named the head coach (and offensive coordinator/tight ends coach) at Brevard College, a school whose football program had only one winning season (2009) in its 10-year NCAA history. Despite the late start and a total of just 24 returnees, only six of whom were seniors, he was able to put together an 88-man roster. Even though the majority were freshmen, the team would post double the victories than the seniors had seen in their entire careers to date. New individual and team records in every aspect of the game were set, and USA South Conference leaders in offense, defense and special teams emerged as well. The 2017 Brevard College offense finished among the top five in program history in seven major categories including ranking first in passing yards and first quarter points. Junior transfer quarterback, O‚ÄôShay Carter, playing behind an all-freshmen offensive line, was the first player in BC's 11-year NCAA history to pass for at least 100 yards in eight straight contests and have four multi-TD passing performances in a single season. His 8-game single season record of completions, yards, and touchdowns surpassed the career records of previous BC quarterbacks. Even though he missed the first and last games due to injury, he ranked second in the conference in yards per game, completions, and touchdowns. Reassigned quarterbacks, Tyler Gregory and Bubba Craven, also set records. First-time tight end Gregory led that position in USA South Conference play with 43 catches and 497 receiving yards. His 14-catch, 225-yard performance against N.C. Wesleyan set a program record in both categories and earned him recognition on D3football.com‚Äôs Team of the Week. First-time wide receiver Craven's 11 touchdowns ranked first in the conference and his receiving yards ranked second. His individual 868 receiving yards in 2017 were more than the combined yardage of the entire receiving corps in 10 of the past 11 seasons. Defensive players set individual program records and ranked first, second, and third in various categories in conference play. True freshmen set special teams records: kicker, Joseph Calhoun, had a conference best 100% PAT completion rate, and Malik Silva was the first BC player in their NCAA history to block two punts in the same contest, returning the second for a 34-yard touchdown. Sophomore Xavier Brown returned a kickoff for a touchdown for the first time in program history. The rebuilding process continued in the 2018 season with a returning squad of sixty-six percent freshmen and six seniors. Once again, despite the youth, multiple school and conference records were set in every phase of the game. In their first year of eligibility for post-season recognition, leaders were posted in receiving touchdowns, sacks, tackles, passing defense, fumble recoveries, return yardage, and blocked punts. Brevard College had six players represented in at least one position‚Äîoffense, defense, and special teams‚Äîon the USA South All-Conference team. Khayat's pro-style offense helped freshman quarterback, Dalton Cole, break 2017 school records, set new ones, and be named USA South Conference Offensive Rookie of the Year. Conference records included ranking first in passing touchdowns and total completions and second in passing yards per game, completions percentage, and average yards per game. Converted QB-to-wide receiver, Bubba Craven, broke his own 2017 records and in just two seasons became Brevard's NCAA-era career record holder for receptions, receiving yards, receiving touchdowns, and average yards per game. He ranked first in the USA South in receiving touchdowns. Season highlights featured most single-game receptions in history, most passing touchdowns in a single game, and the best home record in school's NCAA-era history. In the USA South, the team ranked first in passing touchdowns, passing first downs, and second in completions and time of possession. At the end of the 2019 season, after a 6th place prediction in the preseason coaches‚Äô poll, Khayat posted a historic .800 winning percentage as his team finished in 2nd place at a record setting 8-2. This was the most single season victories in the NCAA-era as well as the most conference wins and wins on the road. Offensive, defensive, and special teams players were honored for USA South Conference awards, post season honors, and four were chosen to D3 Football.com‚Äôs National Team of the Week. Brevard's defense led its conference throughout the regular season with a school-record 19 interceptions (tied for third in all of Division III), 23 turnovers, 105 points allowed, and 11.7 points-per-game allowed. They tallied the third-fewest rushing yards-per-game and scored four touchdowns on defense, which was tied for the lead in the USA South. Selected to play in the ECAC‚Äôs Scotty Whitelaw Bowl versus Carnegie Mellon, Khayat‚Äôs team dominated in their first post season appearance in school history, scoring touchdowns in all phases of the game, nine sacks and 262-25 rushing yards contributing to the 42-28 victory. NFL head coaches for whom Khayat worked include Dennis Green, Joe Gibbs, Jim Zorn, Mike Holmgren (NFLPA Collegiate Bowl) and Jerry Glanville (East West Shrine Game) and offensive coordinators Al Saunders, Sherman Smith, Keith Rowen, Mike Kruczek, and Alex Wood. Personal life His father, Eddie Khayat, was the starting defensive tackle for the 1960 World Champion Philadelphia Eagles and was named the team's head coach in 1971. He is a thirty-five year veteran of the NFL, ten as a player and twenty-five as a coach. His uncle Robert Khayat, the Chancellor Emeritus of the University of Mississippi, was a Pro Bowl kicker for the Washington Redskins and the recipient of the NFL's Alumni Achievement Award and the National Football Foundation Distinguished American Award. His mother, Deborah Dearing Khayat, is the author of Gathered Blooms and Abraham Lincoln: A Life in Verse.

It is a small glandular structure that is located in the posterior region of the third ventricle, near the entrance of the cerebral aqueduct. A photomicrograph of the subcommissural organ in a mouse brain (view from the front). The lightly stained columns projecting toward the center are the apical extensions of the ependymal cells. The posterior commissure is at the top of the photo, and the space below the SCO is part of the third ventricle, which is lined with ependymal cells. Cell nuclei are stained blue. The scale bar = 50 microns (0.05 mm). The name of the SCO comes from its location beneath the posterior commissure, a bundle of nerve fibers interconnecting parts of the two hemispheres of the brain. The SCO is one of the first differentiated brain structures to develop. Although it is evolutionarily an ancient structure that is present throughout the chordate phylum, its arrangement varies somewhat among species. Functions of the SCO are unknown; some evidence indicates it may participate in clearance of certain compounds from the cerebrospinal fluid, and possibly in morphogenetic mechanisms, such as development of the posterior commissure. Structure Cells of the subcommissural organ, which are specialized in the secretion of glycoproteins (see below), are arranged into two layers: a superficial layer called the ependyma and an underlying layer called the hypendyma. The ependyma consists of long, columnar cells that release their secretions into the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid. The hypendyma (which is most prominent in mammals) is characterized by numerous capillaries and glial cells. Hypendymal cells and ependymal cells both are secretory in nature; their processes project to local blood vessels and also to the subarachnoidal space. The ependymal cell bodies present a clear zonation that is especially marked in certain species: 1) In the perinuclear region, large and dilated cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) are the most distinctive ultrastructural feature of virtually all species; 2) the intermediate region consists mainly of RER and Golgi apparatus; 3) the subapical region is relatively narrow, and includes microtubules, mitochondria and smooth endoplasmic reticulum; and 4) the apical region comprises a large protrusion into the ventricle. There are no neuronal cell bodies within the subcommissural organ, although the specialized cells receive some innervation from outside neurons. Function Ependymal cells secrete high molecular mass glycoproteins into the cerebrospinal fluid, in which the bulk of them condense to form a filamentous structure named Reissner‚Äôs fiber. The subcommissural organ/Reissner‚Äôs fiber complex is thought to be involved in the reabsorption and circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid, and with functions related to electrolyte and water balance. One of the proteins secreted by the subcommissural organ, and which is present in Reissner‚Äôs fiber, is spondin. SCO-spondin is a ‚Äúgiant‚Äù (5000 amino acids) glycoprotein (thrombospondin superfamily) found in Vertebrata. This glycoprotein shares molecular domains with axonal pathfinding molecules. The ependymal cells and the SCO‚Äìspondin secretion are thought to play a role in homeostasis. The ependymal cells of the SCO are also involved in the production of brain transthyretin, a protein involved in the transport of thyroid hormones in blood. Some studies indicate the presence of both tyrosine-hydroxylase-immunoreactive nerve fibers and dopamine receptors in the SCO ependyma. In addition, there is evidence suggesting that the SCO activity in adult animals may be regulated by serotonin. All capillaries in the central nervous system with a functional blood-brain barrier express glucose transporters (GLUT1). These transporters are generally absent in leaky barrier structures. The circumventricular organs that are known to have leaky barrier capillaries were stained by fibronectin antibodies but not by GLUT1 antibodies. The subcommissural organ appears to be unique in that it shows neither GLUT1 nor capillary. Reissner's fiber Reissner's fiber is also thought to be important in morphogenetic neuronal processes, being involved in neuronal survival, aggregation and neurite extension. In vitro studies demonstrated that the presence of RF, in conjunction with glial cells, is essential to the survival of neuronal cells. The studies seem to point that the RF might bind some of the growth factors produced by glial cells and transport them to the neurons. On the process of neuronal aggregation, RF seems to serve as a control factor in direct cell-to-cell communication, favoring neuronal aggregation when the density of neurons is low and preventing this aggregation when the density gets higher. Although the mechanism behind this is not well understood, it is known to be linked to the different domains in SCO-spondin that are related to coagulation factors and TSRs, as referred above. Furthermore, the RF as a part on the neurite extension, promoting neurite outgrowth from both spinal and cortical neurons, in cell cultures, which may also be connected to the TSR domains of SCO- spondin. SCO-spondin, a glycoprotein of the SCO/RF complex The primary structure of the major constituent of bovine RF, SCO-spondin, has been fully established as a large N-glycosylated protein (450 kDa). Many lines of evidence denote that SCO-spondin plays a role in CNS development. This molecule belongs to a protein superfamily exhibiting conserved motifs of the thrombospondin type 1 repeat. Proteins of this family are strongly expressed during mammalian CNS development, being involved in mechanisms of cellular adhesion and axonal pathfinding (a process by which neurons send out axons to reach the correct targets during neural development). Numerous investigations have been directed towards the identification and characterization of the secretory compounds of the SCO, clarifying partially its function. Immunoblot analyses of bovine SCO using antibodies against RF glycoproteins allowed the identification of high molecular weight glycoproteins of 540, 450, 320 and 190 kDa. The 540 and the 320 kDa compounds would correspond to precursor forms. Multidomain organization The main SCO-spondin isoform consists of multiple domains. This multidomain organization is a special feature of the Chordate Phylum, and there is a high degree of conservation in the amino acids composition in mammals. The complete sequence and modular organization of SCO- spondin was first characterized in Bos taurus. The structure of this protein is unique as it presents a mosaic arrangement of these domains along the backbone. The putative function of SCO-spondin in neuronal differentiation is discussed regarding these features and homologies with other developmental molecules of the central nervous system exhibiting TSR domains, and involved in axonal guidance. Peptides corresponding to SCO-spondin TSR domains strongly increased adhesivity and neuritic outgrouth of cortical neurons and induced disaggregation of spinal cord neurons. Therefore, it is a candidate to interfere with neuronal development and/or axonal guidance during ontogenesis of the central nervous system in the modulation of side-to-side and side-to- substratum interactions, and also in promoting neurite outgrowth. The identification of conserved domains including Emilin (EMI), von Willebrand factor D (vWD) low-density lipoprotein receptor type A repeats (LDLrA) domains, SCO repeats (SCORs), 26 thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs), a coagulation factor 5/8 type C (FA5-8C) or discoidin motif and a C-terminal cystin knot (CTCK) domain provides a wider insight into the putative function of this protein. Similar types of arrangement was encountered in zonadhesins and immunoglobulin G (IgG) FC binding fragment which may account for SCO- spondin functional aspect on promoting cell-to-substratum adhesivity. The presence of low-density lipoprotein receptor type A (LDLrA) domains repeated ten times in the consensus sequence could provide a hint as to the function of SCORs, since LDLrA are known to interact with proteases or protease inhibitors. There may be a functional link between LDLrAs and SCORs, which could both be involved in the regulation of either protease activation or protease inhibition. The motifs coagulation factor 5/8 type C or discoidin and thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) present in SCO-spondin consensus were initially described in blood proteins, where they were shown to play a role in coagulation or platelet aggregation. SCO-spondin and F-spondin share a similar pattern of expression in the floor plate, flexural organ and subcommissural organ and could have a redundant activity. The biological function of F-spondin and SCO-spondin on the deflection of commissural axons in the neural tube was assessed respectively by experiments of gain and loss of function and by analyses of mutants with defective floor plate. F-spondin and SCO-spondin were both shown to promote neurite outgrowth of various neuronal cell populations, in cell culture. SCO-spondin may interfere with several biological events during early ontogenetical development of the CNS. Nevertheless, SCO-spondin is also present during the adult life, and similarly to thrombospondins, which act on various biological systems, i.e., neuronal differentiation, angiogenesis and platelet aggregation. Development=SCO Despite being a much conserved structure throughout evolution, there are some differences on the SCO from different mammals. It is the first secretory structure to differentiate and remains fully developed and functional during the life of almost every vertebrate, excluding bats, anthropoid apes and humans. More specifically, in humans, the SCO development has a regressive nature. It reaches its apex development in fetus from 3 to 5 month old, functioning as a fully active secretory structure of the brain during this time span, and extending from the pineal recess over the posterior commissure to the mesocoelic recess. It is composed by a characteristic high columnar epithelium, which is not found in the adult SCO. Following this maxed developed state, the SCO starts regressing and in children from 3 to 4 years old it already has a vestigial character, being reduced to islet like structures on the adult. Although the remaining cells can possess some secretory material the SCO is truly vestigial in both structure and secretory function, in adults. SCO-spondin As part of the embryonic cerebrospinal fluid (eCSF), SCO-spondin is of the uttermost importance in the development of the neuronal system, being a key protein in the balancing of differentiation and proliferation of the neuroepithelium. It starts being secreted by the diencephalic floor plate in the first embryonic stages playing an important part in the development and differentiation of structures such as the pineal gland. In particular, the SCO-spondin appears to have a major role on the growth of the posterior commissure (PC), which was proved when mutants lacking SCO, and hence having no SCO-spondin, were unable to form a functional PC. On early stages of development the axonal growth is stimulated, being inhibited afterwards. A steep gradient of spondin expression in the neuroepithelium signals the need for different processes to take place, favoring the fasciculation on the cephalic region and the incorporation of new neurons on the caudal region. As such, the lower concentrations of SCO-spondin in the caudal region favor the axonal outgrowth and incorporation of new axons on the posterior commissure and the higher concentrations in the cephalic region promotes the interactions between the neighboring axons. In conjugation with the secretion of SCO-spondin, the midline positioning of the SCO assumes a great importance on the axon guidance process. This positioning facilitates the signaling of the turning points for the axons, through the spreading of spondin. In addition to the functions in axon guidance and related growth of the posterior commissure, the SCO-spondin also appears to have a role on the adhesion of the trophoblast to the uterine walls. There is a slightly different SCO-spondin produced in the trophoblast, most likely due to alternative splicing. This spondin may recognize the classic protein on the uterine wall, facilitating the adhesion. Clinical significance=Hydrocephalus Given that the subcommissural organ is not highly permeable and does not possess fenestrated capillaries like other subventricular organs, it has emerged as a major site of congenital hydrocephalus. It is suggested that this is related to immunological blockage of SCO secretions and Sylvian's aqueduct malformation and obliteration or turbulent cerebrospinal fluid flow due to the absence of Reissner's fibers. There is evidence that in transgenic mice the overexpression of Sox3 in the dorsal midline of the diencephalon in a dose-dependent manner and that the conditional inactivation of presenilin-1 or the lack of huntingtin in wnt cell lineages leads to congenital hydrocephalus, which highlights the role of these proteins mediating the relation between the SCO and the condition (see also: Wnt signaling pathway for more information). A more recent study using HTx rats reinforced the idea that the abnormal and dysfunction of the SCO precedes the development of the hydrocephalus. Other disease It is reported that in spontaneously hypertensive rats there is a relation between SCO and hypertension due to changing in its secretor activity and protein composition. History In 1860, Ernst Reissner, anatomist at the University of Dorpat, published a monograph on the microscopic structure of the spinal cord of Petromyzon fluviatilis. He described a string of 1.5 Œºm in diameter characterized by its high refringence, its extremely regular shape, and its lying free within the central canal. In 1866, Karl Kutschin confirmed Reissner‚Äôs observations and named the fibrous structure Reissner‚Äôs fiber. Edinger (1892) described, in sharks, what later was known as ‚Äúthe subcommissural organ‚Äù. Studnicka (1900), called attention to uncommonly tall ependymal cells covering the posterior comissure of P. fluviatilis. Sargent, also in 1900, establishes the basis of what is presently regarded as the subcomissural organ ‚Äì Reissner fiber complex. Finally, in 1910, Dendy and Nicholls introduce the term ‚Äúsubcommissural organ‚Äù to describe this brain gland. The rich vascularization of the SCO was first reported by Pesonen (1940). In 1958, Helmut Hofer postulated that this organ, despite its structural and functional differences from other circumventricular organs, is a highly secretory component of the circumventricular organ system.

Intending to spend a year as a tourist, he arrived in Hawaii but decided to stay. He received his MA from the University of Hawaii in 1922 and his PhD from Columbia University. He taught Botany at the University of Hawaii from 1925 to 1927, and was the first naturalist for what are now Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and Haleakala National Park. In 1932, Degener started the first book on Hawaiian plants published since that of William Hillebrand in 1888. It was titled Flora Hawaiiensis, and published in several volumes over his lifetime. On January 10, 1953 he married the botanist Isa Irmgard Hansen, whom he met in Berlin in 1952. They collected plants together in the Hawaiian archipelago. After 1956 Isa Degener was a coauthor for Flora Hawaiiensis. Amy B. H. Greenwell assisted in some of the volumes, and left her property as a botanical garden. He collected over 36,000 different species and preserved some 900 threatened and endangered plants. His specimens were left to the New York Botanical Garden. Degener was guest botanist on the second \\"Cheng Ho\\" expedition, which lasted from 1940 to 1941 and was sponsored by Anne Mills Archbold. During about eight months he collected over 2,000 specimens from Fijian plants, which were sent to Albert Charles Smith and other specialists in the United States.

January 2008. It was presumed extinct in the 1950s when the last surviving seedling perished. However, in 1970, a single plant was discovered on the same Kauluwai estate where the \\"last\\" individual grew, presumably a surviving relict of one of the plants previously cultivated there. Although this tree was destroyed in a fire in 1978, a branch that was removed earlier was grafted onto the related, and also endangered, Kokia kauaiensis. Currently there exist about 23 grafted plants. Putative pollinators Its eventual extinction in wild state of the species seems for a large part due to coextinction with native nectarivorous birds. K. cookei seems to be adapted to bird pollination like most related Malvaceae. The birds, Drepanidinae, were extirpated from dryland forest by Polynesians, and most remaining species entirely succumbed to mosquito-borne diseases like avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum) and fowlpox in the 19th century. The wide, large flowers of Molokai kokio would have admitted a wide range of potential pollinators (as opposed to e.g. Hibiscadelphus): * Maui Nui alauahio, Paroreomyza montana ssp? ‚Äì extirpated from island (prehistorically?) * KƒÅkƒÅwahie, Paroreomyza flammea ‚Äì extirpated from lowlands by 1900, extinct (1963) * Common amakihi, Hemignathus virens ‚Äì extirpated from lowlands by 1900 * Iiwi, Vestiaria coccinea ‚Äì extirpated from lowlands by 1900 * Black mamo, Drepanis funerea ‚Äì extinct (1907); not certain if it regularly occurred in habitat * Apapane, Himatione sanguinea ‚Äì extirpated from lowlands by 1900 * Akohekohe, Palmeria dolei ‚Äì extirpated from island (1907); not certain if it regularly occurred in habitat Of these, the Iiwi was perhaps the most important, given that the other species are/were all either smallish and short-billed (K. cookei has quite large flowers), or did probably not occur in its habitat in significant numbers.

Headstone Manor & Museum is a museum of the site itself as well as Harrow more generally. It also hosts a programme of talks, tours, events and family activities for visitors. Headstone Manor & Museum is open Tuesday to Sunday, all year round. Entry to the site and the museum is free.  History of Headstone Manor House  The land on which Headstone Manor stands is recorded to have belonged to Wulfred, Archbishop of Canterbury in 825 AD. It is located in Headstone, in the London Borough of Harrow. Headstone ManorStill in ecclesiastical ownership, the construction of the Manor House began around 1310, as revealed by dendochronological dating of the building‚Äôs oldest timbers. Archbishop John Stratford purchased more land around the house in 1344 and used it as his main residence in Middlesex. Headstone Manor remained the property of the Archbishops of Canterbury until the Reformation, when in 1546 it was surrendered to Henry VIII by Thomas Cranmer. Henry VIII was ‚ÄòLord of the Manor of Headstone‚Äô for six days, before selling the property to Edward North, a court favourite. During the 16th century it appears that parts of the manor were demolished and extended, including the great hall and the high end. In 1631 the house belonged to Francis Rewse and family, who panelled part of the great hall and built a rear extension. The house was sold in 1649 to William Williams, who built a substantial new wing, including cellars, bedrooms and a pantry. In the 1770s another wing was built, and a brick fa√ßade. At some point in the 17th or 18th century, the building was converted to a farmhouse. Headstone Manor eventually fell into a state of disrepair, and much of its surrounding land was sold off in the 19th & 20th centuries for the development that surrounds it today. In 1925. Hendon Rural District Council bought the site to create what is now Headstone Recreation Ground. Following local government reorganisation in 1968 responsibility for Headstone Manor fell to the newly created London Borough of Harrow. After further years of increasing dilapidation, local people campaigned and volunteered to turn the site into a Museum for Harrow, which officially opened in 1986. Following a Heritage Lottery Funded regeneration of the site the Museum reopened in 2017. Headstone Manor & Museum Site 'The Great Barn' The Headstone Manor & Museum site consists of four separate buildings with the museum being based in the Manor House itself. The site also includes a 14th century complete and filled moat.  Headstone Manor House  Built in around 1310, Headstone Manor is the earliest surviving timber framed house in Middlesex. The fabric of this Grade I listed building contains work dating from the 14th, 17th and 18th centuries. Headstone Manor has been described as ‚Äòone of the most interesting domestic complexes in the whole country‚Äô. The Manor House now contains the museum at Headstone Manor, telling the history of Harrow through the house and the people who have lived there over its history.  The Great Barn  The Grade II 500-year-old Great Barn was used to store grain and livestock when Headstone Manor was a working farm. It was also the centre of local home front activities in the area during World War II as well as the first home of the museum in the 1980‚Äôs. The Great Barn is now available to hire for functions and weddings as well as being used for community events. The Great Barn is only open on special event days and will not be open to the general public except on public event days. Although, whenever possible, Headstone Manor & Museum Guided Tours go inside the barn.  The Small Barn  The Small Barn stands opposite The Great Barn and is also a Grade II listed building. It dates back to the Tudor period, when it would have been used to house livestock. It now houses the entrance to the museum, exploring the history of Harrow before The Manor House was built, as well as a short film introducing the site.  The Granary  Dating from the early 19th Century, the Granary was originally constructed at Pinner Park Farm. The building was relocated to the Headstone Manor and Museum site in 1992. The Granary is now Headstone Manor & Museum's dedicated learning center, a space for schools sessions, family & kids workshops, adult learning as well as Tuesday Talks. During school sessions, The Granary is not be open to the public. When the building is not in use by a group, members of the public are free to enter and use the free art cart located on the ground floor of the building.  Additional facilities = The Moat Caf√© and Visitor Centre  Located near The Small Barn, The Moat Caf√© and Visitor Centre is where freshly ground coffee, cakes, paninis and other hot snacks are available. The Visitor Centre also houses a gift shop, with a range of handcrafted pieces including jewellery, books and children‚Äôs gifts. The Visitor Centre also contains a disabled toilet and baby changing facilities. The Moat caf√© and visitor centre is open every day except Mondays.  Car Park  There is a free car park in Pinner View, 100m from the entrance gate of Headstone Manor Museum.  Cycling  There are several different bike racks by the car park and the Headstone Recreation entrances to the museum.

It is 196 metres (643 ft.) tall, qualifying it as a Marilyn. It is the highest sea stack in Scotland and the British Isles.The National Trust for Scotland has 191 m. The name Stac an Armin means stack of the soldier/warrior, and evidence remains showing it was used by people living nearby as a hunting grounds. It is not believed to have been inhabited year round, but has hosted some (involuntary) extended stays. Climbing the rocks was once done to collect eggs and has continued in the form of recreational sport. The island was once home to the now extinct great auk, and rules exist to protect the bird habitats and breeding grounds. Stac an Armin is 400 metres (¬º mi) north of Boreray and near the 172-metre-high (564 ft) Stac Lee. Stac an Armin is separated from Boreray by a channel \\"so littered with rocks\\" that it should not be sailed, though sailors write passionately about the views. Stac an Armin with Boreray to the left and Stac Lee beyond at right History and people The first written account of the island was Martin Martin's description in the early 18th century. Martin wrote about the island after the Scottish writer had visited St Kilda in 1697 and included a few anecdotes about the stack in his A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland published in 1703. It was the first comprehensive book on the archipelago, to which was appended \\"A Late Voyage to St Kilda\\". Martin calls the island \\"Stack-Narmin.\\"\\"A Late Voyage to St. Kilda,\\" chapter 2, in It was never inhabited full-time, but hunting its bird population helped sustain the way of life of the population of St Kilda, as evidenced by the buildings they left behind. There are no fewer than 78 storage cleitean on Stac an Armin and a small bothy, built by the St Kildans. Martin describes these cleitean as \\"pyramids\\" and wrote they were used to \\"preserve and dry\\" birds, especially the \\"solan goose\\" (northern gannet). Martin observed one harvest that brought in 800 birds. In addition to the geese, the islanders used Stac an Armin for harvesting great auks, gannets, and puffins, as well as their eggs. The numerous birds that lived on the island were an important source of sustenance for the people of St Kilda. Boreray with Stac an Armin (left) and Stac Lee (right) The longest recorded period anyone ever spent on the island was about nine months. Three men and eight boys from Hirta were marooned here from about 15 August 1727 until 13 May 1728. As luck would have it, Hirta suffered a smallpox outbreak while the eleven were on the stack, and thus the islanders were unable to man a boat and retrieve them until the next year. Such temporary accidental occupation of the island may have been a regular event, since Martin Martin also relates, in an anecdote in A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland, how a group of some twenty men were stranded on the island for a couple of days after the rope that held their boat broke. They survived by fishing, and communicated to their wives that they were alive and well by lighting \\"as many fires on the top of an eminence as there were men in number.\\" Martin adds, curiously, that the wives were so overjoyed that they managed to produce a record harvest of corn that year.Martin, A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland. The archipelago as a whole was evacuated in 1930, and bequeathed to the National Trust for Scotland in 1957. Hunting birds is no longer allowed, and the stack is visited only occasionally by scientists, journalists and climbers. The last great auk in Britain Natural History Museum, London On Stac an Armin, in July, 1840, the last great auk (Pinguinus impennis) seen in BritainRackwitz, Travels to Terra Incognito, 347. was caught and killed. A then 75-year-old inhabitant of St Kilda told Henry Evans, a frequent visitor to the archipelago, that he and his father-in-law with another man had caught a \\"garefowl,\\" noticing its little wings and the large white spot on its head. They tied it up and kept it alive for three days, and then killed it by beating it with a stick, apparently because they believed it to be a witch. The last known specimens in the world were killed a few years later either in Eldey, Iceland, or off Newfoundland. Climbing the stack Native St Kildans have climbed Stac an Armin and other cliffs in St Kilda for centuries in order to harvest birds and eggs; they climbed alpine-style, barefoot or in thick socks, using ropes pleated of horse hair. Modern ascents are few; some may have been done illegally. Mountaindays.net has no routes, information, or comments; however, chatter among online groups suggests attempts are made.See, for instance, Alan Dawson, \\"St Kilda (25)\\": \\"I have spoken to four people who have been there and who between them have climbed all the St Kilda Marilyns.\\" The summit of Stac an Armin was reached by a party of 11 Marilyn baggers on 13 October 2014.BBC News Prior to that, the only verifiable modern ascent happened in 1969, when a group which included Dick Balharry and John Morton Boyd made a number of ascents in the archipelago, which included climbing Stac an Armin. Climbing Stac an Armin (and Stac Lee), though attractive (\\"St Kilda presents some of the most challenging climbing in Britain\\") is complicated by a number of factors. The climb of Stac an Armin itself is described as \\"little easier than Stac Lee,\\" but the topography makes it a \\"major expedition\\" and \\"the weather can make nonsense of any landing plans.\\"Alan Dawson, \\"St Kilda (25)\\" The stack is accessible only with difficulty;\\"Landing on Stac an Armin is the difficulty, in this case, as the climb itself is reported to be straightforward.\\" St Kilda Management Plan 2003‚Äì2008, 102.\\"I doubt if many in the Marhofn 1000-up club will ever climb Stac an Armin or Stac Lee, unless helicopter-assisted.\\" more importantly, since the entire archipelago is both a national nature reserve and a World Heritage Site (principally for the cliffs and seabird coloniesSt Kilda Management Plan 2003‚Äì2008, 10. See also p. 66, \\"It was placed on the World Heritage List in 1986 for its natural characteristics only.\\") managed by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), climbing is strictly regulated since it potentially disturbs the natural and cultural heritage and particularly the rich birdlife; according to the 2003 Management Plan, \\"For natural heritage interests, natural processes will normally be allowed to continue without intervention.\\"St Kilda Management Plan 2003‚Äì2008, 21. The St Kilda archipelago The 2003 management plan is quite specific about the dangers of climbing in St Kilda: the object of prescription 21.5 is to \\"Ensure that breeding seabirds are not disturbed by climbing on the cliffs,\\"St Kilda Management Plan 2003‚Äì2008, 41. though the Plan suggests the allowance of climbing the cliffs under strictly monitored circumstances.\\"St Kilda‚Äôs sea cliffs are the highest in the UK and thus offer an attractive challenge to modern day climbers. However, climbing on the sea stacs and cliffs causes disturbance to nesting seabirds and for that reason special permission is required from the Trust and SNH under the terms of the St Kilda bylaws.\\" St Kilda Management Plan 2003‚Äì2008, 45. Prescription 26.4 states that a policy that satisfies climbers and does not violate the Trust's mission is to be developed.\\"Develop a policy on climbing on St Kilda that ensures rock climbing does not in any way interfere with breeding seabirds, vegetated sea cliffs or wild land quality.\\" St Kilda Management Plan 2003‚Äì2008, 45.

Classic Gold was broadcast on analogue and DAB digital platforms, as well as Sky channel 0189. The first stations were launched in 1988; the network grew to 18 stations and was merged into what became the Gold network in 2007. History Most of the stations were originally the medium wave services of Independent Local Radio stations. For example, \\"Classic Gold 1359\\" in Coventry was originally part of Mercia Sound and was a full local service. In the 1980s, FM/AM stations split (in this case to Mercia FM and Xtra AM), before the station was bought by GWR radio in 1993, and the AM station rebranded to \\"Classic Gold\\". In 1998, Classic Gold in Northampton legally rebranded to Classic Gold 1557 Northamptonshire. The stations were sold to UBC in two tranches in 2000 and 2002; however, in 2007 they came back under the control of GCap (formerly GWR & Capital). Most stations in the network carried the same programming, except for a local 4-hour afternoon programme from 3pm to 7pm. Additionally, the AM service operated by UTV Radio in West Yorkshire, Pulse Classic Gold, carried programming supplied by the Classic Gold network (with additional localisation and programmes), although it was not owned by UBC. In summer 2007, GCap Media agreed to acquire the 18 AM Classic Gold radio stations owned by Classic Gold Digital for a cash consideration of ¬£3.95 million. GCap merged the network with its own Capital Gold network of stations to form one classic hits network. The acquisition, which included relevant DAB digital licences held by Classic Gold, was approved by Ofcom. The new network rebranded as 'Gold' launched at 7pm on Friday 3 August 2007.

The published form, edited by Nel King, reduced the original manuscript by more than two thirds.Harrington, Richard (June 2, 1993) \\"Mementos of Mingus: Library of Congress Acquires Works of Composer\\". The Washington Post. p. B1. Before editing, the typescript contained mostly dialog; a lot of the prose was formed during King's second edit. She chose to retain the pimp stories, thereby giving them greater prominence than in the original manuscript; this decision may have been related to the commercial success of Iceberg Slim's book, Pimp, in the late 1960s. Reception The reviewer for the journal Notes commented that \\"the reader is forced to plow through page after page of erotica (some might label it pornography) in order to ferret out the most basic kind of information about the man and his music.\\" The Washington Post 's reviewer stated that the book is \\"sexual fantasy and tortured personality conflict\\", and complained that there was little information about Mingus' music or those he played with.West, Hollie I. (May 15, 1971) \\"Bass Viol Book\\". The Washington Post. p. C4. The Observer 's reviewer believed that \\"Mingus has made a contribution to recent American literature that even his well-wishers could not have anticipated\\", and stressed that the bassist had described \\"what it feels like to be an artist ‚Äì actually be it, in a world that is not only trying to stop you being an artist but has tried to stop you being human in the first place.\\"James, Clive (August 15, 1971) \\"Jim Crow in the Jazz World\\". The Observer. p. 23. Writer Toby Litt stated that \\"His autobiography is that of a profoundly troubled, often bitter man who never feels loved enough but constantly undermines those loves offered to him.\\"Litt, Toby \\"Penguin Readers' Group\\" . Penguin. Retrieved August 30, 2014. Mingus' last wife, Sue Mingus, indicated that the book was an account of \\"the superficial Mingus, the flashy one, not the real one.\\"Rockwell, John (January 9, 1979) \\"Charles Mingus, 56, Bass Player, Bandleader and Composer, Dead\\".

Early life O'Brien was born in Aylesbury in the United Kingdom. His father was a pilot in the Royal Air Force (RAF) who was sent to New Zealand during the Second World War. In 1940, he moved with his mother and sister to New Zealand by boat, narrowly avoiding being torpedoed by German u-boats, to follow his father who had taken up a post as Chief Air Instructor to the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) during the Second World War. Shortly after the end of the war, O'Brien returned to the United Kingdom to be educated at Beaumont College, and later University College Oxford where he read history. Following graduation O'Brien returned to New Zealand with which he had developed a great affinity in his early years and joined the then Department of External Affairs (subsequently the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade) in 1959. Career O'Brien served as a diplomat with the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade for over 40 years from 1959 ‚Äì 2001. He held early postings in the 1960s in Bangkok, London, and Brussels. It was in Brussels that as a first secretary he helped New Zealand to negotiate a special deal with the European Community giving access for New Zealand dairy products to Europe when the United Kingdom joined the Community in 1972. O'Brien then served as High Commissioner to the Cook Islands (1975‚Äì77), and then as Ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva (1980‚Äì83), to the European Community in Brussels (1983‚Äì86) and finally to the United Nations in New York (1990‚Äì93) where he was instrumental in helping New Zealand to secure a seat on the UN Security Council. He was President of the United Nations Security Council during the war in Yugoslavia. While in New York, his leadership was a critical factor in New Zealand's securing a seat on the United Nations Security Council, despite competition from more favoured countries such as Spain and Sweden. Nicknamed by the New Zealand press on several occasions \\"Chardonnay O'Brien\\" for his love of a good glass of wine and a good cocktail party, O'Brien is known for his global view and his articulation of the role of New Zealand as an independent and free thinking country with its own values and way of doing things. O'Brien has always believed that small countries like New Zealand need to use and support international institutions such as the United Nations to promote common and universal values and have influence in international affairs. Later years In 1993 O'Brien was appointed Founding Director of the New Zealand Centre for Strategic StudiesProfile on Centre for Strategic Studies He served as Director for almost 8 years until his retirement in 2001, earning the new institution a respected reputation and high public profile. Controversy surrounded his replacement in 2002 by David Dickens, a former Ministry of Defence official. The Parliamentary Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade investigated the matter and issued a critical report. In 2009, O'Brien published a book entitled 'Presence of Mind: New Zealand in the World'. The book New Zealand in the World is a selection of writings on the place of New Zealand in the world reflecting on the position of a small country such as New Zealand and its place on the international stage from the perspective of a small, internationally minded, modern and multicultural democracy. The book stresses the importance of New Zealand taking an independent view on international affairs, reflecting its heritage as a nation located in the south-west Pacific with both Maori and European roots. O'Brien continues as an Advisor to the Centre for Strategic Studies and a regular contributor to the New Zealand media on foreign policy issues. During 2012 he wrote several articles arguing against proposed reforms in the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.Dominion Post 13 April 2011, March 2012 and 2 April 2012 His argument was that becoming a diplomat requires a special type of skill and that treating the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a purely business approach was short-sighted and not to the long-term benefit of New Zealand.

From 1941 he and his wife Marthe Kreikemeyer were close assistants of Noel Field who supported German anti-Nazi refugees in France and Switzerland. He died in East German detention as a victim of the Noel Field show trials, which had the function to replace Communist Party officials with others more aligned with Moscow.  Life  Kreikemeyer was a skilled lathe worker. He joined the union in 1910 and 1919 the Communist Party. Through his work for the Communist Party functionary, he came into close contact with Willi M√ºnzenberg. Kreikemeyer was severely wounded in the Spanish Civil War and then later used as the first Chief Executive of the German department, as Chefadjudant for all senior divisions of the International Brigades. In these activities he had contact with Erich Mielke, who was then under the code name Leistner or Leissner chief of the instruction department and adjutant of the central administration. Among other things, it is known that both efforts Kreikemeyer Mielke knew to settle in the safe in Mexico, as well as to help that Mielke from the Fund Noel Field erhielt.  Post-war period  After the Second World War they settled in East Berlin. In 1949 Kreikemeyer became Director General of the East German railway company Deutsche Reichsbahn. When in 1950 the slandering campaign started against Noel Field ‚Äì he was accused of having built an anti- Communist spy network while pretending to be a Communist sympathizer ‚Äì Kreikemeyer was arrested and never seen again. At least one propaganda article against the alleged spy was published in an East German newspaper and a show trial against him was prepared, but never took place. Mrs Kreikemeyer wrote dozens of letters to the GDR authorities inquiring about her husband's fate. For seven years the authorities pretended that Willi Kreikemeyer was alive and well, waiting for his trial. Fearing her own arrest, Mrs Kreikemeyer escaped to her home country France in 1954. She continued writing her letters. In 1957 she was told that Willi Kreikemeyer had died a few days after his imprisonment. Erich Mielke (later the East German Minister of State Security) had been responsible for the detainee. In a confidential document he claimed that Kreikemeyer had committed suicide in his prison cell on 31 August 1950.The document, written by Mielke's assistant Alfred Scholz in 1954/57 (!), can be found at the bottom of Wilfriede Otto's article (see above) This story has been proven to be a lie.One out of many facts listed in \\"Leistner is Mielke\\": The death certificate, issued in 1957, pronounced Kreikemeyer to death because of being missed for seven years, p. 284 But what really happened to Kreikemeyer can hardly be reconstructed. Today it is known that Kreikemeyer named Mielke as one of the persons supported by Noel Field. That information threatened Mielke's career: according to a Soviet order, people, who had spent the war in the West had to resign from public office. (In his official CV, Mielke claimed that he had fought in the Red Army during World War II). What's more, alleged collaboration with an \\"American spy\\" could have led to the death penalty. It is therefore likely that Willi Kreikemeyer was murdered on behalf of Erich Mielke.That's what the whole book \\"Leistner ist Mielke\\" is about  Rehabilitation  The newly established, emerged from the SED to PDS - Today \\"The Left\\", decided at a meeting on 20‚Äì21 January 1990, among other things, people who the bloody terror of Stalin in the Soviet Union have fallen victim to rehabilitate.

He appointed to lesser khagans. He was said to be collecting excessive taxes from the Chile, leading to resentment among the Tiele. Khagan thus suspected the Tiele chieftains and, on one occasion, gathered some 100 Tiele chieftains and slaughtered them. Tiele thereafter rebelled and supported Geleng (Ê≠åÊ•û), the chieftain of the Qibi (Â•ëËãæ), as the Yiwuzhenmohe Khan (ÊòìÂãøÁúüËé´Ë≥ÄÂèØÊ±ó). They also supported Yishibo as Yiedie Khan, as a subordinate khan under Geleng. About 605 Tiele rebels drove him from Dzungaria to the Ili River area.Karakoja, Niri and 605 are from Christoph Baumer, History of Central Asia, volume two, 2014, (index). The rest is probably from Lev Gumilyov. Pei Ju suggested forming an alliance with khagan's subordinate Sheguy, who had been requesting to marry a Sui princess. Emperor Yang agreed and subsequently, Sheguy attacked khagan, defeating him and forcing him to flee to Gaochang. Emperor Yang then sent Pei to Gaochang to persuade Daman to come to Sui. Khagan refused at first. However, after being threatened that his mother would be killed, he had to agree. He subsequently stayed in China and did not return to his own land. Emperor Yang, pleased with this development, awarded Pei with a sable coat and jewels that Daman offered as tribute. In 611, he was created Heshana Khagan (Êõ∑Ëñ©ÈÇ£ÂèØÊ±ó) by imperial decree and was married to a Chinese princess. By 619, he was no longer in control of his khaganate and was at Chang'an, the capital of China's Tang Dynasty, when Emperor Gaozu of Tang, giving in to Shibi khagan's pressure, had him delivered to Eastern Turk emissaries to be executed.

Like the other weavers, the males build an enclosed nest from reeds and mud, and visiting females select a mate at least partially based on the quality of the nest. alt= Distribution Resident or local migrant, endemic to South Asia. Species is described as 'common' in at least parts of its range. It is found throughout northern part of Indian subcontinent. Local Names: , . Description It is sparrow-sized with a length of about 15 cm. * Appearance: The male in breeding plumage has a brilliant golden-yellow crown and a variable amount of black on the head and breast; some males have an entirely black head (apart from the yellow crown) and breast, while others have a white throat or an entirely white face with a black band separating it from the fulvous-white underparts. In the non- breeding male and female, the crown is brown like the rest of the upperpart plumage, and the black pectoral band is less developed. It has a prominent supercilium, a spot behind ear, and narrow moustachial streaks, which are pale yellow. Flocks frequent cultivation and the reedy margins of tanks and jheels (shallow lakes), or extensive tall grass areas. * Behaviour: It is polygynous and colonial, and on the whole similar to that of the baya and streaked weavers. * Courtship: Male constructs the nest single-handedly, with a group of females visiting it during late construction stage, jumping on the helmets, tugging and testing, presumably for strength. If a female appears interested, the male bows low before her, presenting his golden crown to her. He flaps his wings deliberately and sings softly ', like the chirp of a cricket or the subdued squeaking of an unoiled bicycle wheel. Once the female agrees and permits copulation, he quickly completes the rest of the nest, and she lays her eggs inside. He immediately commences a second nest nearby to attract other females, and occasionally a third nest, or very rarely a fourth. Nests not accepted by females may be torn down by the builder himself. Synopsis / Handbook Number 1012, vol. 10, p. 100-102. For black-breasted weaver behaviour and nest, quotes articles by Cooke (JBNHS v.60:1-48) and Ambedkar (JBNHS:69:268-82). Nesting Nest suspended from grass, India * Season: June to September * Nest: Similar to the streaked weaver; somewhat smaller and normally with shorter entrance tubes. Built in reed-beds in marsh, often moonj or kans (Saccharum spontaneum), with some of the growing reeds incorporated into the dome as support. Entrance tube is somewhat shorter than Baya weavers (up to about 25 cm). At the 'helmet' stage of construction a quantity of wet mud or cowdung is daubed thickly along the edge, with bright coloured scarlet or orange flowers or flower petals (Lantana, Lagerstroemia) incorporated; observations suggest that this is part of the courtship rituals and exercise a direct influence on the reactions of the visiting female, both for this species and the streaked weaver. * Colony: Singly or in scattered groups of 4 or 5; sometimes larger colonies. * Eggs: 3 or 4, white, indistinguishable from those of the other two weavers.

Roughly 85% of the single- family dwellings are owner occupied, as are one in four of the duplexes. The remainder are rented. The neighbourhood is bounded on the south by 118 Avenue, on the west by 50 Street, on the north by 122 Avenue, and on the east by 34 Street. Jubilee Park is located in Beacon Heights.

The Consulate General of the United States in Frankfurt am Main represents the interests of the United States government in Frankfurt, Germany and nearby surrounding areas. It is the United States' largest Consulate General, and is larger, in terms of both personnel and facilities, than many U.S. Embassies. Technically a part of Mission Germany, and reporting through the Embassy of the United States in Berlin, the Frankfurt Consulate General operates with a significant degree of autonomy when compared to other U.S. Consulates. This is due in part to several large U.S. government regional centers housed within the Consulate, which provide support in the areas of security, construction, and financial matters to a number of other U.S Diplomatic posts located throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In 2006 the Frankfurt Consulate General relocated most all of its operations to a single facility - a former hospital, once operated by the U.S military, and before that by the German military during World War II. The refurbished and now modified building is quite large and expansive. The Frankfurt Consular district covers the German states of Hesse, Rhineland-Palatinate, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, and Saarland. Use by intelligence agencies In March 2017 a series of documents, referred to as Vault 7, released by WikiLeaks revealed that the US government uses the consulate as a base for cyber operations. This diplomatic representation was known to be the largest US consulate worldwide, in terms of both personnel and facilities, and has played a prominent role in the US government's intelligence architecture for years. The intelligence personnel including CIA agents, NSA spies, military secret service personnel, the US Department of Homeland Security employees and the Secret Service employees are working in the building complex with high walls and barbed wire in the north of the city. In a radius of about 40 kilometers around Frankfurt, the Americans had also established a dense network of outposts and shell companies in Frankfurt. WikiLeaks documents reveal the Frankfurt hackers, part of the Center for Cyber Intelligence Europe (CCIE), were given cover identities and diplomatic passports to obfuscate customs officers to gain entry to Germany.John Goetz, Frederik Obermaier: (8)Frankfurter US-Konsulat soll Spionagezentrale sein - Politik, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, 7 March 2017 The CIA station, in the consulate, is said to also collect Iranian intelligence in Europe, surveil on Iranian officials and target possible defectors who work in Iran's nuclear weapons program.

Religious communities must be registered by the Committee on Religious Affairs under the Council of Ministers. It is legal to distribute Christian literature. Restriction In early 2009 Tajikistan enacted a new law on religious practice which essentially limits worship to state-sanctioned forms. The new law imposes censorship on religious literature and restricts performing rituals to state- approved venues. It makes it harder for new religious communities to get registration. This law has been used to ban the Christian aid group.Targeting Christians in Central Asia Persecutions by Muslims In recent years, several incidents of violence and discrimination against the Christian minority have been reported.

Composition and working methods The representatives of the 78 ACP states who, under the Cotonou Agreement, must be members of Parliament, meet their 78 European Parliament counterparts in plenary session for one week twice a year. The Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) meets alternately in an ACP country and an EU country. The institution is governed by common, democratic rules. Two co-presidents who are elected by the Assembly direct its work. Twenty-four vice-presidents (12 European and 12 ACP) who are also elected by the Assembly constitute the Bureau of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, together with the two co-presidents. The Bureau meets several times a year in order to ensure the continuity of the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and to prepare new initiatives aimed notably at reinforcing and improving cooperation. It also considers topical political questions and adopts positions on all human rights cases. Three Standing Committees have been created in 2003 to draw up substantive proposals which are then voted on by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly. These Committees are: > * Committee on Political Affairs * Committee on Economic Development, > Finance and Trade * Committee on Social Affairs and the Environment The Assembly regularly forms exploratory or fact-finding missions. The members of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly are thus in direct contact with the situation on the ground in the various developing countries which are signatories of the Cotonou Agreement. Initiatives taken by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly The Joint Parliamentary Assembly has made an active contribution towards implementing and reinforcing successive ACP-EU Conventions and has put forward numerous proposals: :* the upgrading of the role of women in the development process; :* the integration of environment policy in development projects; :* promotion of Trade as a tool for development, particularly by way of the Economic Partnership Agreements foreseen in the Cotonou Agreement; :* the drawing-up of rural development programmes and micro-projects tailored to the needs of specific communities; :* the improvement of measures aimed at combating epidemics and the reinforcement of health and hygiene services; :* the creation of decentralized development policies; :* the convening of annual meetings between economic and social partners; :* the promotion of regional, political and commercial cooperation; :* closer cooperation with non-governmental organisations engaged in development; :* aid for indebted countries pursuing structural adjustment policies to allow them to maintain indispensable services; :* measures to enhance the cultural dimension in North-South cooperation; :* the acceleration of aid procedures and the increase in appropriations intended for refugees and for displaced persons (the latter is a new departure); :* measures to reinforce the commitment to respect and defend human rights and human dignity.

Born in Falmouth, England, Stewart was educated first at Clayesmore School and then at St John's College at Cambridge where was taught and influenced by F. R. Leavis. He entered the film industry in the early 1930s. He trained as a film editor at Gaumont-British, initially cutting together out-takes from Marry Me (1932) and working as assembly cutter on The Constant Nymph that same year. His first film as editor was Forbidden Territory (1934). Among the films he cut were Evergreen (1934), Alfred Hitchcock's original version of The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934), Dark Journey (1937), Action for Slander (1937), South Riding (1938), St. Martin's Lane (1938), and The Spy in Black (1939). During World War II, Stewart was commissioned into the Army Film and Photographic Unit (AFPU) in 1940 and in 1942 led No. 2 AFPU during the Allied landings in Tunisia. The following year he edited film footage from the fighting into the documentary Desert Victory. In 1944 he co-directed Tunisian Victory with Frank Capra and John Houston, although much of that film was shot in the United States. Stewart went on to lead No. 5 AFPU, covering the D-Day landings, the Battle for Caen and the Rhine Crossing. Perhaps Stewart's most notable contribution to film resulted from his insistence on filming Bergen-Belsen concentration camp following its liberation, with its piles of bodies being bulldozed into mass graves, its overcrowded barrack blocks and pitifully emaciated survivors. He was awarded a military MBE and demobilized with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. After World War II, Stewart became a film producer, beginning with Trottie True (1949). He began to produce the films of comedian Norman Wisdom, from Man of the Moment (1955) onwards, and the comedy duo of Morecambe and Wise. Although he went into semi-retirement in the late 1960s, he produced several films for the Children's Film Foundation, including All at Sea (1970), Mr. Horatio Knibbles (1971), and High Rise Donkey (1980). He died on 31 May 2011, at the age of 100.

Bernard Zweers (born Bernardus Josephus Wilhelmus Zweers) (18 May 1854 in Amsterdam - 9 December 1924 in Amsterdam) was a Dutch composer and music teacher. Life Bernard Zweers was born in 1854 as the son of an Amsterdam book- and music shopkeeper and piano tuner. Although his father was an amateur singer, he strongly disapproved of his son‚Äôs musical interests, expecting him to follow him in the family business. Being fundamentally self- taught, he had some minor musical successes before his parents finally approved and sent him to study with Salomon Jadassohn in Leipzig in 1881-1883. Of crucial importance to Zweers' musical education was his first exposure to the work of Richard Wagner when he was present at the Berlin premiere of the Ring des Nibelungen, in 1881: > I, who never ventured farther than Nijmegen and who had never heard even a > normal opera before, I was in Berlin, listening to Wagner's Ring! ... and I > returned a full-blooded Wagnerian. After his return, he became active in Dutch musical life and took on various appointments, including the conductorship of various choirs. However, due to deterioration of his hearing abilities and his own wish to concentrate on teaching, he relinquished most of these. From 1895 to 1922 he was head of teaching and composition at the Amsterdam conservatory but rather than impose his own music on his pupils, he left them the freedom to develop their own style - a break with the policies of his predecessor Johannes Verhulst. He became a highly esteemed, even revered teacher to a whole generation of Dutch composers. Aside from his didactic abilities, Zweers was renowned for his sense of humour. At one meeting of the Dutch Musicians‚Äô Association (Nederlandse Toonkunstenaars Vereeniging), Zweers‚Äô Second Symphony was programmed along with Huyschenruyter‚Äôs Concert Overture. Just before the concert, Huyschenruyter approached Zweers to tell him how much he‚Äôd enjoyed his symphony (in rehearsal). After a moment‚Äôs silence, Zweers responded: ‚ÄúSir, I have not heard your overture, but I am certain that my symphony is on a higher level‚Äù. Dumbstruck by this display of artist‚Äôs arrogance, Huyschenruyter stood silent until Zweers burst out laughing: ‚ÄúOf course, because your overture is in D, and my symphony is written in E flat!‚Äù Work In 1907, the Leyden professor Pieter Blok published the last part of his History of the Dutch People, dedicated to the arts. However, he totally ignored music, claiming Dutch music did not possess any ‚Äònational character‚Äô. The composer Johan Wagenaar published a rebuttal, in which he claimed that ‚Äòtrue‚Äô Dutch music could be characterised by a ‚Äòsimple, spirited or firm melody, by a sense of the cosy and quietly sensitive, a sharp rhythm and, finally, a sense of humour‚Äô. Wagenaar named two works as an example: Peter van Anrooy‚Äôs Piet Hein Rhapsody, an orchestral pot-boiler based on a popular song about the seventeenth century Dutch naval hero Piet Hein and Bernard Zweers‚Äô Third Symphony, subtitled ‚ÄòTo My Fatherland‚Äô. Indeed, Zweers could be said to be the most overtly nationalistic of all Dutch composers. Not in the sense that, like so many other European composers, he based his music exclusively on folk music, but more in his exploitation of national themes. However, there is a strange dichotomy in Zweers‚Äô ideas about music. On the one hand, he strived to develop a specifically Dutch brand of music, free from foreign influence. For instance, his vocal music only employs Dutch-language texts, and when it has a programme, that is frequently inspired by Dutch themes: Rembrandt, Vondel‚Äôs Gijsbrecht van Aemstel, Dutch landscapes, and so forth. His aim was the greater good of Dutch art, because ‚ÄúNever will art get a foothold with a people, when it uses a foreign language in song, or when it takes in art by means of foreign tongues‚Äù. On the other hand, the German influences in his music are undeniable. His Second Symphony is thoroughly Wagnerian; his Third gave him the epithet ‚Äòthe Dutch Bruckner‚Äô. One cannot imagine Zweers much appreciating that honour (and it really is undeserved as well, since the only Brucknerian thing about the work is its length). That Third Symphony (1887-1889) was to become by far Zweers‚Äô most famous work. Its large scale prohibited it from being performed very often and made publication expensive (the publisher A.A. Noske experienced a great loss as sales were poor), but the work was, and is, regarded as a milestone in the development of Dutch music, combining folk tunes with a lyrical description of Dutch landscapes. It was therefore unavoidable that Wagenaar should use it as an example of ‚Äòtypical‚Äô Dutch music.

Function  This enzyme allows the body to use and to recycle the B vitamin biotin, sometimes called vitamin H. Biotinidase extracts biotin from food because the body needs biotin in its free, unattached form. This enzyme also recycles biotin from enzymes in the body that use it as a helper component in order to function. These enzymes, known as carboxylases, are important in the processing of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. Biotin is attached to these carboxylase enzymes through an amino acid (the building material of proteins) called lysine, forming a complex called biocytin. Biotinidase removes biotin from biocytin and makes it available to be reused by other enzymes.  Clinical significance  Biotin, sometimes called vitamin H, is an important water-soluble vitamin that aids in the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates and proteins. The human body cannot produce biotin, but it can obtain it from the diet, internal recycling and at some extent from intestinal bacteria. Biotin deficiency can result in behavioral disorders, lack of coordination, learning disabilities and seizure. Unlike most vitamins, which are noncovalently bound to enzymes, biotin is chemically linked (covalently bound), and therefore cannot be easily removed from the enzyme denaturation. Without biotinidase activity, the vitamin biotin cannot be separated from foods and therefore cannot be used by the body. Biotinidase deficiency is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the BTD gene. When biotinidase activity is deficient, biotin can be neither recycled within the body nor removed from ingested food. Nor can biotin be recycled from enzymes to which it is bound. Deficient biotinidase activity causes specific metabolic enzymes, called carboxylases, to be nonfunctional, inhibiting the proper processing of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Individuals lacking biotinidase activity can still have normal carboxylases if they ingest small amounts of biotin. Approximately 1 in 60,000 newborns are affected by profound (less than 10 percent of normal enzyme activity) or partial (10-30 percent of normal enzyme activity) biotinidase deficiency.  Genetics  The BTD gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 3 at position 25, from base pair 15,618,326 to base pair 15,662,328. Mutations in the BTD gene cause biotinidase deficiency. Approximately 100 mutations in the BTD gene that lead to biotinidase deficiency have been discovered. These mutations either prevent the enzyme from being made or cause the enzyme that is produced to be nonfunctional. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the gene in each cell must be altered for a person to be affected by the disorder. Most often, the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene.

Originating from the town of Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire, he studied at the University of Cambridge and later at All Souls College, Oxford, and served as Dean of St Paul's Cathedral in London between 1540 and 1545. Incent is noted for being one of the agents of the Lord Chancellor Thomas Cromwell, responsible for the sequestration of religious properties during the Dissolution of the Monasteries and as the founder of Berkhamsted Collegiate School.John Cook (2000), A Glimpse of Our History: A Short Guide Around Berkhamsted, Berkhamsted Heritage Walk leaflet, Berkhamsted Town Council. His home in Berkhamsted, built in 1500, remains in use to the present day, situated on the High Street facing St Peter's Church. Early life John Incent was born in Berkhamsted around 1480 and was the son of Katherine and Robert Incent. Robert was the Secretary to Cicely, Duchess of York, the last royal resident at Berkhamsted Castle, wife of the Duke of York and mother of two Kings of England: Edward IV and Richard III. The standing of the Incent family in the town is marked by two brass memorials to Robert and Katherine in St John's Chapel in St Peter's Church. According to the inscriptions, Robert died in 1485 of the Great Sweating Sickness: Education and career At the age of 20, Incent studied civil law for one year at Cambridge University, continuing his studies at All Souls College, Oxford and graduating as a Bachelor of Common Law. In 1509 he was appointed as an ecclesiastical lawyer in the Chancellor's Court. Richard Foxe, Bishop of Winchester and the Lord Privy Seal, appointed Incent in 1512 Commissary and President of the Episcopal Consistory in the Winchester diocese. Incent became a Doctor of Civil Law in 1513, and in the same year he was ordained as a priest in the Church of England. Incent's career continued to flourish: he took charge of several parishes around Winchester; became master of the Hospital of St Cross in Winchester and the Hospital of Domus Dei in Portsmouth; and he acquired a prebendal stall in St Paul's Cathedral. Upon Bishop Foxe's death in 1529, Cardinal Wolsey became Bishop of Winchester and Incent soon became Chaplain to King Henry VIII, serving during the turbulent period of Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon. Following the break with Rome, Incent, like many other clergy, renounced Roman Catholicism. Incent's loyalty to the king was evident; he was a faithful supporter of the king's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, who was a leader of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and probably played an active part in the destruction of religious houses. In 1540 he turned the Domus Dei Hospital over to the Crown for use as an arsenal in the coastal defences against France. Incent's devotion was rewarded when he was appointed by the king as Dean of St Paul's Cathedral. Cromwell, meanwhile had fallen into disfavour with the king and he was executed that same year.

Incent was master of the Brotherhood of St John the Baptist in Berkhamsted, a monastic hospital which Incent himself had closed down. In 1523 he appropriated the brotherhood's lands and joined it to his own land, donating it for the creation of a school. In 1541 he obtained a Royal Charter for \\"one chauntry perpetual and schools for boys not exceeding 144 to be called Dean Incent's Free School in Berkhamstedde\\". Records of the time state that Incent \\"builded with all speed a fair schoole lartge and great all of brick very sumptuously.\\". It was completed in 1544 ; \\"when ye said school was thus finished, ye Deane sent for ye cheafe men of ye towne into ye school where he kneeling gave thanks to Almighty God\\". The school had no chapel of its own; for over 300 years the St John's Chantry in neighbouring St Peter's Church was used exclusively by the masters and boys of the school for worship, until a new school chapel was built in 1894 by Charles Henry Rew, based on the design of the church of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, Venice. Incent died some 18 months after his school opened, but it remains today as a lasting legacy of his more constructive activities. The founder died intestate and there were legal arguments originating from \\"Evill Persons\\" who claimed a financial interest in his estate. To protect the school from subsequent challenges of this nature, school was incorporated by an Act of Parliament as The Free Schole of King Edwarde the Sixte in Berkhampstedde, making the Master and the Usher into trustees of the school property and making the Warden of All Soul's, Oxford the Visitor. The school received a common seal bearing Incent's coat of arms of crossed swords on a blue shield.

Antimicrobial Chemotherapy: Pocketbook. CRC Press, 1996 Page 25 It can be determined from broth dilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests by subculturing to agar plates that do not contain the test agent. The MBC is identified by determining the lowest concentration of antibacterial agent that reduces the viability of the initial bacterial inoculum by ‚â•99.9%. The MBC is complementary to the MIC; whereas the MIC test demonstrates the lowest level of antimicrobial agent that inhibits growth, the MBC demonstrates the lowest level of antimicrobial agent that results in microbial death. This means that even if a particular MIC shows inhibition, plating the bacteria onto agar might still result in organism proliferation because the antimicrobial did not cause death. Antibacterial agents are usually regarded as bactericidal if the MBC is no more than four times the MIC. Because the MBC test uses colony- forming units as a proxy measure of bacterial viability, it can be confounded by antibacterial agents which cause aggregation of bacterial cells.

Despite his solid performances, however, he was considered too small at 5'7\\" to be relied upon as a #1 netminder. At the trade deadline near the end of the 1987‚Äì88 season, Boston would acquire star netminder Andy Moog from the Edmonton Oilers. Lemelin was now the backup, and Keans was relegated to the #3 position and sent to the minors. He would spend another season in the minors before retiring in 1989, although he would come out of retirement for two brief stints in low-end minor pro during the 1990s. Keans finished his 9-year NHL career with 96‚Äì64‚Äì26 record and 3.50 GAA in 210 career appearances, along with 4 shutouts.

He is head coach of Shamrock Rovers U17's. Cousins was involved in full-time football from the age of sixteen when he joined English club Chelsea, where he spent two years. Throughout his career he played for Dundalk, Liverpool, Hereford United, Middlesbrough, Bohemians, Shamrock Rovers and Bray Wanderers. He is the first cousin of Tommy Dunne.  Playing career  He made his League of Ireland debut for Dundalk at Waterford on 25 September 1988. After two years at Oriel Park, during which he shared the PFAI Young Player of the Year Award in 1989/90, he signed for Liverpool. Due to injury he failed to make a single first team appearance before getting a free transfer to Middlesbrough at the end of the 1992/93 season. After 3 appearances for Hereford he came home to sign for Bohemians where he scored 22 goals in 83 league games over three seasons. He signed for Shamrock Rovers in the summer of 1996, making his debut in a preseason friendly against Heart of Midlothian. His first of many goals for the Hoops came in a friendly win against Crewe Alexandra. Three weeks later, he scored his first competitive goal in a 2‚Äì2 draw against Shelbourne in the League of Ireland Cup. His first league goal came against Bray Wanderers on 13 September 1996. In his first season with Shamrock Rovers he was the joint top goalscorer in the League of Ireland Premier Division, winning Player of the Month in February 1997. The following season, he was the team's top goalscorer with 15 league goals. During the six years he played with Rovers he scored 46 goals in 145 league appearances and a total of 65 goals in 190 appearances, including one goal in two appearances in European competition. Having completed his time with Shamrock Rovers, he spent one season with Bray Wanderers before retiring. Cousins was capped six times by the Irish Under 21 team at the start of his career, scoring four goals.  Coaching career  Tony Cousins was appointed U-21 coach at Shamrock Rovers before becoming assistant to Liam Buckley in 2003. In February 2005, he was appointed assistant coach at Drogheda United. He became coach of Galway United in 2006, where he stayed for two seasons. He was removed from his position in March 2008, following a home defeat to Shamrock Rovers. He replaced John Ryan as coach of Kildare County on 24 October 2008 for the remainder of the 2008 season. Tony Cousins was appointed Longford Town manager in December 2009. He resigned as manager in August 2016 after 209 league games in charge. In his time at the club, Cousins improved the side's fortunes each season as the Town finished 9th, 6th, 3rd and 2nd in his first four seasons in the First Division. This period included promotion play-off defeats to Waterford United and Bray Wanderers in successive seasons. In his 5th season in charge, Cousins eventually led the Town to their first ever league title in senior football as they were crowned 2014 First Division champions. A memorable 5‚Äì0 home victory against Shamrock Rovers B, before over 2000 spectators, secured the title. The 2015 season saw the Town back in the top flight of Irish football for the first time since 2007. Cousins led the side to a highly commendable 6th-place finish and an FAI Cup semi-final appearance. The following season proved more difficult however as Longford sat rooted to the bottom of the division before Cousins' decision to step down on 13 August 2016.

Service history=Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, 1898‚Äì1899 Vicksburg left Newport, Rhode Island on 16 January 1898, sailing for the Caribbean. On 26 April, at the start of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, she sailed south to join in the blockade of Cuba. For the next three months, Vicksburg patrolled the Cuban coast near Havana, returning to Key West, Florida periodically for fuel and provisions. During her tour of duty in Cuban waters, she captured three blockade runners. In May, she took Oriente and Fernandito on the 5th and 7th, respectively. Both were small unarmed sailing ships bound from the Gulf of Campeche to Havana with cargoes of fish. The gunboat took each to Key West where they were condemned by a prize court. Her third and final capture came more than a month later on 24 June when she encountered Ampala, a sailing vessel, bound from Havana to Trujillo. Though Ampala carried no cargo save provisions for her passengers, Vicksburg took her to Key West where she, too, was duly condemned. On one occasion, on 7 May, Vicksburg came under the fire of the Santa Clara Battery shore battery near Havana. By August, hostilities in Cuba were ending, and the need for blockading ships diminished. Vicksburg departed Cuban waters on the 14th and, after a three-day stop at Key West, continued north to Newport where she arrived on 23 August. During the remaining months of 1898 and the first five months of 1899, she operated along the east coast and in the Caribbean. On 24 May 1899, Vicksburg was placed out of commission at Boston. Asiatic Station, 1900‚Äì1904 Almost a year later, on 15 May 1900, the gunboat was recommissioned at Newport, R.I., Comdr. E. B. Barry in command. After six months of operations in the Atlantic, Vicksburg stood out of Boston on 9 November for duty on the Asiatic Station. She sailed via the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal and arrived at Cavite‚Äîon the island of Luzon in the Philippines‚Äîon 2 February 1901. During the first of her three years in the Far East, Vicksburg joined other Navy units in supporting the Army's campaign in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War which followed Spain's ceding the islands to the U.S. Vicksburg herself contributed significantly to the success of those operations when she assisted Army forces in capturing the Philippine president, Emilio Aguinaldo, at Palanan, Isabela in March 1901. She also cooperated with the Army again in June during the occupation of Puerto Princesa and Cuyo, the two major cities on the island. In 1902, the warship moved north and, for the remaining two years of her tour, cruised the waters off the coasts of China, Japan, and Korea. She spent the entire first quarter of 1904 at Chemulpo, Korea, protecting American interests during the initial stages of the Russo-Japanese War. On 9 June 1904, Vicksburg took leave of Asia when she stood out of Yokohama, Japan, and shaped a course for home. She reached Bremerton, Washington, on 29 June but later moved south to the Mare Island Navy Yard near San Francisco, California. There, she was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 15 July 1904. Central America, 1909‚Äì1912 Vicksburg, U.S.N. 24 November 1909 After almost five years of inactivity, Vicksburg was placed back in commission at Mare Island on 17 May 1909, Cdr. Alexander S. Halstead in command. The gunboat departed San Francisco on 16 June and headed south to the coast of Mexico and the Isthmus of Panama. During the next four years, she cruised the western coast of Central America in an effort to support American diplomatic moves to maintain peace in the revolution-prone nations in the area. For that purpose, she made calls at ports in Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Panama. Conditions in Nicaragua were especially volatile during those years, and Vicksburg returned to Corinto and other Nicaraguan ports time and time again. During the early summer of 1912, she began operating primarily along the California coast. In late August, she cruised south for an extended courtesy visit to Guaymas, Mexico. The gunboat returned to the U.S. at San Diego on 3 November. Training ship, 1912‚Äì1917 Following repairs at the Mare Island and the Puget Sound Navy Yards, she began duty with the Washington Naval Militia on 18 June. That service occupied her almost completely until the U.S. entered World War I in the spring of 1917. The only exception came in May‚ÄìJune 1914, when she was placed back in full commission for a brief cruise to Mexico. Upon her return to Puget Sound, she reverted to reserve status and resumed training duty with the Washington Naval Militia. World War I, 1917‚Äì1921 Schooner Alexander Agassiz alongside USS Vicksburg in March 1918 On 6 April 1917, the U.S. associated herself with the Allied Powers in World War I by declaring war on the German Empire. A week later, on 13 April, Vicksburg was placed back in full commission at Puget Sound. The gunboat patrolled the western coasts of the United States and Mexico through the end of the war. That German influence was particularly strong in Mexico during the war is evidenced by the fact that Germany started reasonably serious negotiations to persuade Mexico to enter the war on the side of the Central Powers. The infamous Zimmermann Telegram‚Äîwhich offered Mexico the opportunity to recoup her losses in the American Southwest‚Äîcontributed greatly to the United States' decision to go to war against Germany. Thus, the Navy had to flex its muscles convincingly to dissuade Mexico from assisting the Central Powers. Vicksburg and the other ships which patrolled the Mexican coasts helped provide the influence necessary to keep that nation out of the enemy camp. As a result of her mildly pro-German attitude, Mexico became a center for German activity in the western hemisphere, particularly after the U.S. entered the war. Incidents involving German nationals occurred frequently. One such incident provided Vicksburg with the single concrete reward for her vigilance. On 17 March 1918, she anchored off the harbor at Viejo Bay, Mexico, in response to information that a ship carrying German nationals would attempt to leave the port. At 12:25, she sighted the schooner Alexander Agassiz standing out to sea under the American flag and immediately got underway to intercept her. The schooner tried to make a dash for it, but a shot across her bow forced the Alexander Agassiz to heave to and submit to a search. Vicksburgs boarding party made some interesting discoveries. The schooner carried 14 people, of whom five were German and six were Mexican. Two others were women, one of whom was purportedly the vessel's owner. The remaining passenger was an American, probably the informant upon whose advice the capture was made since he is listed in Vicksburgs war diary as \\"...one American spy...\\" The motorized sailing vessel also carried some small arms and a quantity of ammunition as well as a \\"German flag\\". The people were taken on board Vicksburg, and the five Germans were put in irons. Vicksburg justified the capture on the fact that the schooner carried enemy nationals and that she possessed no proper ship's papers. In a three-hour discussion held that afternoon with the Captain of the Port, the British Vice Consul, and commanding officers of other American ships in the area, Vicksburgs commanding officer supported his action further with the fact that the passengers were seen to throw articles overboard just before the boarding party arrived and with the suggestion that the Alexander Agassiz had been fitted out as a raider. That shaky proposition was later repudiated by an American prize court which ordered that restitution be made to the owner of the schooner. It now seems likely that the five Germans were simply making a desperate attempt to return home. Later that month, Vicksburg delivered her prize to San Diego and the prisoners to Los Angeles. She then resumed her patrols off California and remained so occupied through the remaining months of the war. The gunboat continued her active service for almost a year after hostilities stopped in November 1918. On 16 October 1919, she was finally decommissioned for the last time at Puget Sound; and, four days later, she was transferred to the Washington State Nautical School. Vicksburg served as a training ship with the school until 1921. During this period, she received the designation PG-11 on 17 July 1920, when the Navy adopted the alphanumeric system of hull designations. Coast Guard, 1921‚Äì1944 On 2 May 1921, Vicksburg was transferred once more‚Äîthis time to the Coast Guard‚Äîand her name was struck from the Navy List. She was renamed Alexander Hamilton on 18 August 1922 and served as a training ship at the Coast Guard Academy until 1930. The Coast Guard decommissioned her on 7 June 1930, stripped her, and towed her to the depot at Curtis Bay, Maryland, where she was permanently assigned as station ship. Sometime between 1 July 1935 and 1 July 1936, she was renamed Beta and, by 1 July 1940, she had been reassigned to New London, Connecticut, as a station ship. In 1942, she was towed back to Curtis Bay where she served as a training platform for machinist's mates and water tenders. That duty lasted until 30 December 1944, when she was finally placed out of service completely. On 28 March 1946, the hulk was turned over to the War Shipping Administration for final disposition. Presumably, she was scrapped. References * * External links *The Papers of William A.

To read his main article, please see Yue Fei. Yue Fei, a Chinese general of the Song Dynasty remembered for his exploits in the Jin‚ÄìSong wars, has appeared in various types of media; including black-and-white films, plays, games, wuxia novels, and folktales. Literature The Legend of Zhou Tong *Xiyoubu (Ë•øÈÅäË£ú; Supplement to Journey to the West, 1640), a Ming Dynasty addendum to the classical novel Journey to the West, which takes place between the end of chapter 61 and the beginning of 62. In the novel, the Monkey King faces a representation of his own carnal desires and is trapped inside of a tower full of mirrors, each with its own powers. One mirror causes him to travel forward in time from the Tang to the Song Dynasty. There, some junior devils appear and tell him that the ruler of the underworld King Yama has recently died of an illness and so Monkey must take his place until a suitable replacement can be found. Monkey ends up judging the fate of the recently deceased Prime Minister Qin Hui. He tortures Qin into confessing his sins. These tortures include having millions of embroidery needles shoved into his flesh, being ground into paste, thrown onto a mountain of swords and spears, hacked into bits, forced to drink human puss, and his rib cage ripped apart to give him the appearance of a dragonfly. A demon is charged with using his magic breath to \\"blow\\" Qin back into his proper form. Monkey finally sends a demon to heaven to retrieve a powerful magic gourd that sucks anyone who speaks before it inside and melts them down into a bloody stew. He uses this gourd for Qin's final punishment. Meanwhile, Monkey invites the ghost of Yue Fei to the underworld and takes him as his third master. (He claims this completes his lessons on the three religions since: 1) the immortal Subhodhi taught him Taoist magic; 2) the monk Tang Sanzang taught him Buddhist restraint; 3) Yue Fei taught him Confucian ideals.) He entertains Yue Fei until Qin Hui has been reduced to liquid and offers the general a cup of Qin's \\"blood wine\\". Yue, however, refuses on the grounds that drinking it would sully his soul. Monkey then does an experiment where he makes a junior devil drink of the wine. Sometime later, the devil, apparently under the evil influence of the blood wine, murders his personal religious teacher and escapes into the \\"gate of ghosts,\\" presumably being reborn into another existence. Yue Fei then takes his leave to return to his heavenly abode. Monkey sends him off with a huge display of respect by making all of the millions of denizens of the underworld kowtow before him.Dong, Yue, Shuen-fu Lin, Larry James Schulz, and Cheng·∫ªn Wu.

In fact, filming of Genghis Khan is also under consideration, but it must be a good script, because a lot of people have filmed this story, and the story itself is complicated and randomized, so up to now, there isn't a concrete plan yet. And [the script for] Yue Fei is nearly completed.\\" He continues, \\"I think Yue Fei is a man with great sense of loyalty, so am I. I've been loyal to Golden Harvest, to friends and to my country!\\" Filming will not begin until Chan finishes filming several other projects (including Rush Hour 3), but he is willing to work for reduced pay so he can work with his son.

Storytelling Shuo Yue Quanzhuan is a favorite among Pingshu (Ë©ïÊõ∏) or Pinghua (Ë©ïË©±) storytellers, which is a modern-day form of Shuoshu (Ë™™Êõ∏) storytelling that became popular in the Tang and Song dynasties. One of the most famous of these artists is Liu Lanfang (b. 1944), a noted singer and actress. She first made a name for herself in 1972 when she sang the full-length script of Shuo Yue Quanzhuan. In September 1981, the Chunfeng Literature Publishing House published the 100-chapter pingshu script of Yue Fei's tale.The Story of Yue Fei Pingshu Artist: Liu Lanfang Yue Fei Memorial Hall Yue Fei studies archery According to You Er Hua Bao (ÂπºÂÖíÁï´Â†±; Children's Pictorial Magazine), a Chinese magazine tailored for children ages two through seven, the young Yue Fei purchased a bow, a sword, and a spear to practice martial arts on his own since he did not have a teacher to train him properly. One day when he was chopping firewood, he passed by a village with a martial training hall ran by a famous master. Yue Fei immediately asked the master to become his student, not even knowing that this person was none other than Zhou Tong. Zhou told the boy, \\"Your skill in martial arts is inadequate, so you must first train your eyes.\\" As a part of his training, Yue Fei began to stare directly into the morning sunrise. At first the training was hard because the bright sunlight hurt his eyes, but he continued to practice the skill of the \\"far-sighted person\\" for many years. One day, Zhou came to Yue Fei and pointed to an object high up in the sky. When he focused his trained vision, Yue saw that it was a lone goose. Zhou then directed Yue to scan some trees that were one hundred paces away. Yue again focused his vision and caught sight of two black cicadas on a tree. Zhou then laughed in approval and said \\"Now that your eyesight is practiced, I not only accept you as my student, but also as my adopted son. I will now teach you martial arts.\\" Yue Fei practiced diligently and became a master of the eighteen weapons of war. He could draw a bow weighing 300 catties and, with a \\"whiz\\" of the arrow, shoot a leaf from 100 paces away. The moral of the story is that achievements are only made through diligent practice. It also warns that staring directly into the sun is very dangerous and could permanently damage the eyes.Yue Fei studies archery (Chinese only)About \\"Children‚Äôs Pictorial\\" Magazine (Chinese only) The general and the water tank When Yue Fei was born, there was a red auspicious glow around the Yue family residence so neighbors brought buckets of water to put out some perceived fire. However, they found out that Lady Yue had given birth to a son. With all the people crowded around their house, a Peng landed on the roof and spread its wings over the length of the entire residence. The bird then flew high into the sky and disappeared. The sight of the Chinese roc is why Yue's father named him Fei (È£õ; \\"fly\\"). Days after his birth, a monk warned Yue Fei's father to put his wife and newborn child inside of a water tank if the baby were to cry. Three days later, the baby began to cry, so Yue's father followed the monk's instructions. Then the Yellow River flooded and mother and child were swept to safety, whereas Yue's father drowned in the torrent. In his previous life, Yue had indeed been a Peng himself. He had blinded the eye of a mischievous dragon living within the Yellow River. So when the dragon heard his newly reborn enemy cry, he flooded the river to kill Yue and get his revenge, but failed. Lady Yue raised Yue Fei on money that she saved up from doing sewing for the family who had saved them from the river and taken them into their home. When Yue Fei was 13, he entered a cave and found a monstrous snake sleeping by a stream. He picked up a rock and threw it at the beast. The snake lunged at him in anger, but Yue Fei dodged to one side and pulled on its tail with his supernatural strength. The snake instantly disappeared in a puff of smoke, leaving only a marvelous golden spear named the \\"Magic Spear of the Flowing Spring\\" (). He later found a military teacher who taught him how to wield the spear efficiently. Yue eventually joined the army and became one of the most beloved heroes and martyrs in Chinese history. This story is a derivative of an episode from his fictional biography Shuo Yue Quanzhuan.The General & The Water Tank Qin Hui: The Stinker After Yue Fei's execution, iron statues of Qin Hui, the man responsible for the general's execution; his wife Madam Wang; and two other accomplices were cast in iron and knelt outside Yue's memorial tomb as punishment for their deeds. During the Ming Dynasty, the new Provincial Governor-General of Hangzhou, who was a direct descendant of Qin Hui and Madam Wang, had both iron statues thrown into the West Lake under cover of night. The next day, the lake turned pitch-black and stank of vomit. The townsfolk realized that the lake's condition coincided with the statues' disappearance. When the Governor-General arrived on the scene, the people questioned him about his relationship with Qin Hui. As he knew the statues had sunk to the bottom of the lake, he boasted, \\"If anyone can really scoop the statues out of the lake, I'm waiting to resign and ask for punishment.\\" At that exact moment, the murky water became clear and the statues drifted ashore as if propelled by an invisible force. The cowardly Governor-General bolted for his carriage when he saw this miraculous sight. The townsfolk pelted his carriage with rocks as he fled, many of them ripping through the curtain, giving him huge lumps on his head. That night, the Governor-General escaped from Hangzhou, never to be heard from again. Listen to this story The mad monk sweeps Qin Hui out of the temple During the Southern Song Dynasty there were two famous Buddhists named the \\"Crazy Monk\\" Ji Gong and the \\"Mad Monk\\" Fengbo. Fengbo lived during the time of Yue Fei and became famous for \\"sweeping Qin Hui's face with a broom\\". The story is told after having Yue Fei imprisoned on false charges, Qin Hui went to Lingyin Temple to have his fortune read. There he was confronted by a laughing Fengbo who asked, \\"Cao Cao was once a big hero, but where is he today?\\" Qin Hui asked him what he meant in confusion. Fengbo said, \\"The principles of Heaven are clear. Loyalty and treachery are self-evident. Goodness and evil will be met with reward or retribution. You, as the Prime Minister, hold a lot of power. Why do you want to murder a man who is as important to the country as a pillar is to a house? Does the safety of the nation mean nothing to you?\\" Qin countered \\"Who is that pillar of the country?\\" \\"General Yue Fei!\\" screamed Fengbo. When Qin Hui seemed unaffected by his words, Fengbo laughed and said, \\"What a fool! Repent now before it is too late.\\" He then grabbed a broom and raked it across Qin Hui's face and quickly ran off. Feeling embarrassed, Qin returned to the palace a defeated man. The boldness of the monk caught the attention of the common folk. It is said he would appear in crowded areas and begin to sweep the floor, even in the cleanest of places, and proclaim \\"sweeping Qin\\" as a reminder to the people that they should band together to eliminate the traitor Qin Hui from office. The \\"Mad Monk\\" was later raised to the status of an arhat. The statues of the \\"Mad and Crazy Monks\\" were often seen together in various temples throughout the Southern Song Dynasty. There are two such statues of these arhats in the Daxiong Temple Hall of Zhantan Forest on Mount Jiuhua. One of them is the \\"Crazy Monk\\" Ji Gong in the form of a deity and the other is the \\"Mad Monk\\" Fengbo holding a duster in one hand and a broom under his left armpit, standing ever ready to give the wicked Prime Minister another sweep.An Allusion from History: A Buddhist Monk Feng Bo Upholds Righteousness This is a derivative of an episode from Shuo Yue Quanzhuan, which mentions no \\"sweeping\\" at all. The fortuneteller's name was \\"Xie Renfu of Chengdu\\" and he told the fortunes of both Emperor Gaozong and Qin Hui, who were in disguise, in the Dragon's Intonation Monastery. When Qin returned to the palace he sent men to arrest the fortuneteller, but he had fled the city out of fear once he discovered who they really were.

He continued to produce drawings for the Conan Doyle stories for various publishers during the rest of his career. His model for Holmes was the portrayal of the character by the American actor William Gillette. Steele wrote an essay in 1929 titled \\"Sherlock Holmes: A Little History of the World's Most Famous Fictional Character\\", in which he stated regarding his illustrations, \\"Everybody agreed that Mr. Gillette was the ideal Sherlock Holmes, and it was inevitable that I should copy him.\\" Steele's illustrations were largely responsible for popularizing the association of Holmes with a calabash pipe and deerstalker hat. Steele was a fan of Holmes and wrote several short Sherlock Holmes spoofs. Vincent Starrett dedicated his 1933 book The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes to Steele and two other people including William Gillette. In the book, Starrett praised Steele's illustrations of Holmes, stating that \\"No happier association of author and artist can be imagined\\".

Another indicator for the popularity of the tune was the rush of bootlegs, mash-ups and remix-requests that followed its release. 2008 saw the much longed for re-release of \\"What You Need (The remixes)\\" with Marco V's version conquering the charts anew. When Chagall's second EP \\"Sun Red\\" / \\"Sky Blue\\" was released only a few weeks later, he was well represented on many charts. Djdownload.com, for example, saw him enter the top three straight off. In the last two years, as a remixer he's worked on tracks by Armin van Buuren, Markus Schulz, Marcel Woods, Filo & Peri and Wippenberg. Impressed by his work, the band Above & Beyond voted him their producer of the year in 2007.Above & Beyond interview DJ Mag Poll 2007 In 2008 he performed at numerous trance festivals worldwide including Mysteryland where he played on Ti√´sto's \\"In Search of Sunrise\\" stage. Unlike some of the trance projects who split, Chagall has kept his ties with Bossi: Cosmic Gate is still together and continue to tour major venues and festivals around the world. He also released in 2009 his single \\"This Moment\\" which became a hit in disco clubs and radio shows. He also has his own radio show, \\"Get The Kicks\\" on Afterhours.FM. In 2014 he is looking to release his new single and finish tracks for his first solo album.

He worked as a wheelwright in the Austrian village of Rohrau, where he also served as Marktrichter, an office akin to village mayor. Life Mathias (or Matthias) was born in Hainburg, a small town not far from Rohrau. His ancestors were inhabitants of this town, which had a troubled history; notably his paternal grandparents were fatal civilian casualties in the Turkish occupation of the town in 1683.Geiringer (1982:5) His father, Thomas Haydn, was also a wheelwright. The material prosperity of the family seems to have increased with each generation: the grandfather Kaspar (also a wheelwright) started out as a \\"Burgknecht\\", i.e. \\"a day laborer with a permanent domicile\\"; the father Thomas built himself a house and was formally a \\"citizen\\" of Hainburg;Geiringer (1982:5) Mathias himself rose to the rank of Marktricher in Rohrau and owned farmland as well as a house; and Mathias's son Joseph, the composer, eventually became owner of a very large house in Vienna and died with a large fortune. In his youth, Mathias served an apprenticeship in Hainburg as a wheelwright and then in 1717 departed on the traditional travels of the journeyman. This period of his life lasted ten years, and took him among other places to Frankfurt am Main. He returned once to Hainburg (1722), a fact known because he applied there for a copy of his birth certificate.Hughes 1970, 3 On his final return in 1727 he became a master wheelwright and joined the guild of wheelwrights in Hainburg. However, he settled in nearby Rohrau, where he built a house for himself. The following year he married Maria Koller, aged 21, who had worked as an \\"under- cook\\" in the palace of Count Harrach, the aristocratic patron of Rohrau. The couple had twelve children, of whom six died in infancy.Information in this paragraph up to this point from Geiringer 1982, 5-6 The six children who lived to adulthood were as follows (baptismal names not used in later life are parenthesized). *(Anna Maria) Franziska Haydn (bap. 19 September 1730 - 29 July 1781) *(Franz) Joseph Haydn (born 31 March 1732, died 31 May 1809) *(Johann) Michael Haydn (bap. 14 September 1737 - 19 August 1806) *Anna Maria Haydn (bap. 6 March 1739 - 27 August 1802) *Anna Katherina Haydn (bap. 6 March 1739 - ?before 1801) *Johann Evangelist Haydn (bap. 23 December 1743 - 10 May 1805)Source for children and dates: David Wyn Jones, \\"Haydn family\\", in Jones 2009a. Note that birth dates were not generally preserved at the time, only the (closely coinciding) baptismal dates. Joseph Haydn was baptized 1 April 1732. Maria Koller Haydn died 22 February 1754, aged 47.Robbins Landon and Jones 1988, 30 The following year Mathias remarried, to \\"his servant girl of nineteen\\",Geiringer 1982, 7 whose maiden name was Maria Anna Seeder.Gotwals 1963, 215 The second marriage produced five children, none of whom survived to adulthood.Larsen 1980, 2 Mathias lived on to 1763. This was long enough to see both of his composer sons reach professional success: Michael was a Kapellmeister at Grosswardein,Robbins Landon and Jones 1988, 31 and Joseph had become Vice-Kapellmeister (in fact, Kapellmeister in all but name) for the fabulously wealthy Esterh√°zy family in Eisenstadt. Haydn biographer Georg August Griesinger wrote (1810): > Haydn's father thus had the pleasure of seeing his son in the uniform of > [the Esterh√°zy] family, blue, trimmed with gold, and of hearing from the > Prince many eulogies of the talent of his son.Griesinger 1810, 16 Griesinger goes on to relate how Mathias died: > A short time after this visit, a wood pile fell on Meister Mathias while he > was at work. He suffered broken ribs and died soon hereafter. Mathias and music Mathias apparently enjoyed music a great deal. Griesinger recorded what Joseph had told him in his elderly reminiscences: > The father had seen a bit of the world, as was customary in his trade, and > during his stay in Frankfurt am Main he had learned to strum the harp. As a > master craftsman in Rohrau he continued to practice this instrument for > pleasure after work. Nature, moreover, had endowed him with a good tenor > voice, and his wife ... used to sing to the harp. The melodies of these > songs were so deeply stamped in Joseph Haydn's memory that he could still > recall them in advanced old age.Griesinger 1810, 9 Albert Christoph Dies, another biographer who interviewed Joseph Haydn in old age, tells a similar story, adding that, insofar as Mathias knew how, he instructed his children musically: > In his youth the father journeyed about, following the custom of his trade, > and reached Frankfurt am Main, where he learned to play the harp a little > and, because he liked to sing, to accompany himself on the harp as well as > he could. Afterwards, when he was married, he kept the habit of singing a > little to amuse himself. All the children had to join in his concerts, to > learn the songs, and to develop their singing voice. When his father sang, > Joseph at the age of five used to accompany him as children will by playing > with a stick on a piece of wood that his childish powers of imagination > transformed into a violin.Dies 1810, 80 For further information, see Haydn and folk music. Launching his sons' careers Mathias, with his wife Maria, was also responsible for launching his sons' careers as professional musicians. The crucial events (in the case of Joseph) are narrated, rather differently, by Griesinger and Dies. Here is Griesinger's account: > One day the headmaster from the neighboring town of Hainburg, a distant > relative of the Haydn family,This was Johann Matthias Franck, the husband of > Mathias Haydn's step-sister Juliane Rosina Seefranz (Mathias's mother > Katharina had remarried following her husband's death in 1701); Geiringer p. > 6. came to Rohrau. Meister Mathias and his wife gave their usual little > concert, and five-year-old Joseph sat near his parents and sawed at his left > arm with a stick, as if he were accompanying on the violin. It astonished > the schoolteacher that the boy observed time so correctly. He inferred from > this a natural talent for music and advised the parents to send their > SepperlGriesinger identifies this as a diminutive form of the name \\"Joseph\\"; > presumably, it consists of an infantile pronunciation of the second > syllable, plus the Austrian German diminutive suffix -erl ... to Hainburg so > that he might be set to an art that in time would unfailingly open to him > the prospect \\"of becoming a clergyman.\\" The parents, ardent admirers of the > clergy, joyfully seized this proposal, and in his sixth year Joseph went to > the headmaster in Hainburg. Hainburg is eleven kilometers (seven miles) from Rohrau.Distance Calculator: How Far Is It? ‚Äî Infoplease.com As Joseph moved three years later to Vienna to become a professional chorister under Georg Reutter, he was never to live with his parents again. Biographer Dies tells the same story (presumably, also on the basis of what Joseph Haydn told him) as follows: > Doubtless we are consider his father's love of singing as the first occasion > when Haydn's spirit, already in earliest youth, entered its proper sphere. > How easily the father could have set him to his own trade or dedicated him > to the cloth, the heart's desire of both father and mother. This did not > come about, thanks not a little to his concerts among the neighbors, by > which he had won for himself a reputation in the whole town and even with > the schoolmaster. And thus when the talk was of singing, all were unanimous > in praise of the cartwright's son and could not commend enough his fine > voice. Since his father and the schoolmaster were close friends, it was > natural for the latter to be drawn into consultation over Josephs's artistic > destiny. The deliberations lasted a long time. The father still could not > forget the priesthood. Finally, however, came the moment to decide. The > various opinions converged. It was resolved that Joseph should stay with > music and sooner or later, somewhere or other, perhaps as Regens choriLatin > for \\"director of a choir\\" or even as Kapellmeister, earn an honorable > living. Joseph had passed the age of six when he had to leave his birthplace and travel to Hainburg, a small town not far off. He was recommended to the care of the Regens chori, who undertook to guide the young boy on the virtuoso's course.Dies 1810, 81 As can be seen, the biographers differ on whether it was an unnamed local schoolmaster (Dies), or Franck himself (Griesinger) who advised Haydn's parents to send their son to Franck. They also differ in whether the parents sought musical training with the view that it would help their son become a Catholic priest (Griesinger), or whether they reluctantly decided to give on their hopes for a clerical career for Joseph and let him pursue a musical one instead (Dies). In such cases of conflict Haydn biographers tend to trust Griesinger.See Webster and Feder 2001, 1; Robbins Landon and Jones 1988, 23; and Geiringer 1982, 10, who for the present story reports only Griesinger's version. Dies further states that once Haydn's career in Vienna as a chorister had been ended (by puberty; i.e. the loss of his soprano voice), and Haydn faced the difficult task of trying to survive as a freelance musician in Vienna, his parents insisted that he train as a priest, but that Joseph ultimately prevailed.Dies 1810, 87-88 The launching of Michael's career proceeded more straightforwardly, as Joseph's singing career paved the way for Michael's. According to Dies:1810, 86 > Reutter was so captivated by [Joseph]'s talents that he declared to the > father that even if he had twelve sons, he would take care of them all. The > father saw himself freed of a great burden by this offer, consented to it, > and some five years after dedicated Joseph's brother Michael and still later > Johann to the musical muse. Both were taken on as choirboys, and, to > Joseph's unending joy, both brothers were turned over to him to be trained. Unlike Joseph or Michael, Johann did not become a composer, but worked in the Esterh√°zy household as a tenor; his support may have been paid by Joseph. Mathias's social standing The standing in society of Mathias bears on the biographies of his composer sons, which sometimes portray the Haydn family as impoverished, or as peasants. Karl Geiringer writes: > Mathias lived in a Rohrau in a cottage built by himself, and from the outset > was fairly prosperous. It has been the custom of Haydn biographers to stress > the extreme poverty of his father, and judging from the appearance of the > house in which the Haydns lived throughout their lives, this attitude seems > to be justified. The little low-roofed, thatch-covered cottage is bound to > fill us with pity, and we all feel like Beethoven, who on his deathbed, when > shown a picture of the Haydn house, exclaimed, \\"Strange that so great a man > should have been born in so poor a house!\\" Geiringer goes on to refute the view of poverty, based on evidence from bills that Mathias submitted for his work to Count Harrach as well as Mathias's tax records. Apparently, Mathias had \\"his own wine cellar, his own farmland, and some cattle\\". In addition, a letter he wrote to Michael in the mid-1750s (when both Joseph and Michael were living in Vienna) indicates he could afford at least the occasional extravagance: > Jesus Christ be praised! My very dearest Han√ümichl, I am herewith sending > you a carriage from Rohrau which can bring you and perhaps a good friend > back and forth, and the river will spend the night in the Landstra√ü at the > Falcon or the Angel; you can talk to him and arrange that you and Joseph and > perhaps Ehrrath, all three of you, can get on the road early on Saturday. > Mistress N√§nerl and Mistress Lo√ül and another young lady will also receive a > carriage, but only very early because it's so pitch dark at night, so > heartfelt greetings to all of you, and in God's name. :::::::::::Mathias > HaydnRobbins Landon and Jones, 31Jones (2009b), however, suggests that the > rental of a carriage may have been in response to a family emergency, namely > the need for his sons to attend their mother's funeral (as noted above, she > died in 1754). Mathias as Marktrichter From 1741 to 1761, Mathias was Marktrichter (German; literally \\"market judge\\") of Rohrau. According to Geiringer, \\"the list of his duties [was] imposing ... He was responsible for the good conduct of the population and had to keep a sharp lookout for adultery or excessive gambling. He had to see that people went to church and did not break the Sunday rest. It was his job to allot among the inhabitants of Rohrau the labor required by the patron, Count Harrach, and he was responsible for keeping the local roads in good repair On Sundays at six in the morning he had to report on all such matters to the count's steward. Every two years an open-air meeting of the whole community took place at which the Marktrichter rendered a detailed account of the work done during the past period.\\" Visits to Joseph in Vienna Although Mathias sent both of his future-composer sons away from home when they were young, he certainly did not lose interest in them. This is attested, for instance, by the letter quoted above, and by two visits he made to Vienna that were remembered decades later by Joseph and related to biographers. Of these, the more dramatic was one in which Mathias rescued Joseph from being turned into a castrato. Griesinger (1810) relates the tale thus:Griesinger 1810, 11 > At that time there were still many castrati employed at the court and in the > churches in Vienna, and the director of the Choir SchoolGeorg Reutter > doubtless supposed he was making young Haydn's fortune when he came up with > a plan to turn him into a soprano, and actually asked the father for > permission. The father, whom this proposal utterly displeased, set off at > once on the road for Vienna; and thinking that the operation might perhaps > already have been undertaken, he entered the room where his son was with the > question, \\"Sepperl, does anything hurt you? Can you still walk?\\" Delighted > to find his son unharmed, he protested against all further unreasonable > demands of this sort. ... The truth of this anecdote was vouched for by > persons to whom [Joseph] Haydn has oftentimes told it. A few years later, when Joseph as working as a freelance musician and living in very humble quarters, he suffered a burglary, and Mathias came to Vienna to help: > While he was living in the Seilerstadt, all his few possessions were stolen. > Haydn wrote to his parents to see if they might send him some linen for a > few shirts; his father came to Vienna, brought his son a seventeen-kreutzer > piece and the advice \\"Fear God, and love thy neighbor!\\" By the generosity of > good friends, Haydn soon had his loss restored.

History  \\"Wait 'Till the Sun Shines, Nellie\\" has been recorded many times and is now considered a pop standard. The first recorded versions were by Byron G. Harlan and Harry Tally. Bing Crosby and Mary Martin sang it in the 1941 film Birth of the Blues and also recorded it for Decca Records on March 13, 1942. Harry James recorded a version in 1941 on Columbia 36466. In a long- standing tradition, floor traders at the New York Stock Exchange sing this song on the last trading day of every year and on Christmas Eve. The song has been the stock exchange anthem at least back as far as 1934. It is also a popular song in barbershop music. It appeared as a country music hit as performed by the Golden Memory Boys in the summer of 1940. In the months before his death in 1959, Buddy Holly made a recording of \\"Wait 'Till the Sun Shines, Nellie\\" and other songs now called the \\"Apartment Tapes\\", which he was making as notes for himself while chilling in his living room at his home in New York City. Nowadays this cover of \\"Wait 'Till the Sun Shines, Nellie\\" by Buddy Holly is at the top of searches on YouTube for this song title. His original recording by himself on guitar can be found. Also the released version which has been remixed with added 'backup singers' and instruments is easy to find and is a longer version. A sample of the song, sung a capella by Tom Bromley, an elderly First World War veteran, appears on the Roger Waters 1992 album Amused to Death at the end of the track \\"What God Wants (Part III)\\".

The park is situated in the valley which straddles the Meliadine River. Access is available by foot or vehicle along a gravel road from the community of Rankin Inlet directly to the south side of the park. The park was previously referred to as Ijiraliq, a reference to both the river's cliff area and, in Inuit legend, ijirait, or \\"shadow people\\" (said to live a parallel existence with modern people, they can shift their shapes and vanish at will). The park's physical features include an esker covered by lichen-moss, glacial deposit, bedrock outcrop, and unusual plants, including three-awned grass, found nowhere else in Kivalliq Region. There are more than 45 archaeological sites within the park and these include house ruins, tent rings, graves, and other remains of the Thule. Some of the ruins date back as far as the Pre-Dorset period from 1000 BC to 500 BC. The main archaeological feature is Qamaviniqtalik (\\"place with ancient sod houses\\"). Qamaviniqtalik was occupied from around 1200 to 1775 CE by the Thule, and later by the Caribou Inuit. It was used seasonally, from late summer through early winter. At Qamaviniqtalik are house depressions in the hillside, evidence of the sod houses or qarmat which once existed there. The houses were dug into the ground, lined with stones, and roofed with skins supported by wooden poles. Such sod houses would have been occupied in fall and early winter, after which residents would move to snowhouses or igluit on the sea ice by mid-winter. There are also rings of stones which once supported caribou-skin tents, along with several small stone hearths used to support soapstone cooking pots. A \\"kayak garage\\" for winter storage of kayaks, kayak cradles for drying kayaks after use in the water, stone fox traps, and stone caribou hunting blinds are also features preserved at Qamaviniqtalik.

As an international, Stevenson also played for both Ireland teams ‚Äì the FAI XI and the IFA XI. Stevenson is the only footballer to have played for both the FAI XI and Rangers and is one of only four players born in what is now the Republic of Ireland to play for the club, the others being Alex Craig, James Lowry McAuley and Jon Daly. Club career=Early years Stevenson began his career with Dolphins in the League of Ireland. In 1932 he helped them reach the final of the FAI Cup where they lost 1‚Äì0 to Shamrock Rovers. Shortly afterwards, on 8 May 1932, aged 19 and while still a Dolphins player, he made his debut for the FAI XI in a 2‚Äì0 away win against the Netherlands. In August 1932 he signed for Rangers after being spotted by Arthur Dixon, a club coach. As part of the transfer deal, Rangers played Dolphins in a friendly at Dalymount Park in 1933. Stevenson spent just a season and a half at Rangers. Although he made just 12 appearances in the Scottish League, he scored 7 goals and developed a reputation as a highly intelligent player. While at Rangers, Stevenson also made his debut for the IFA XI and he helped the club win the Division One title during the 1933‚Äì34 season. Everton In January 1934 Stevenson signed for Everton for a fee of ¬£37,000 and made his debut for the club against Arsenal the following month. He remains one of Everton's all-time top goalscorers. He was also a great supplier of goals, first to Dixie Dean and then to Tommy Lawton and he formed an excellent understanding with fellow Irish international Jackie Coulter on the left wing. In 1939, together with Lawton, Joe Mercer and Tommy G. Jones he was a member of the Everton team that won the last First Division title before the start of the Second World War. During this campaign he scored 10 goals in 36 games. During the war, while continuing to play for Everton, Stevenson also enlisted in the RAF. Between 1939 and 1946 he made 202 appearances and scored 89 goals for Everton in wartime regional leagues. One of the highlights of his wartime career came on 1 June 1940 when he scored a hat-trick in the last five minutes of a game against Manchester United. As well as playing for Everton, he also turned out as a guest for both Tranmere Rovers and Blackpool. After the war Stevenson played in an Everton team that also included fellow Irish internationals Peter Farrell, Tommy Eglington and Peter Corr and future team manager Harry Catterick. By the time he finished his career with the club he had made 255 English League appearances and scored 82 league goals. He also played a further 16 games and scored a further 8 goals in the FA Cup. He made his final league appearance for Everton on 7 May 1949. Irish international When Stevenson began his international career in 1932 there were, in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the Belfast-based IFA and the Dublin-based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and selected players from the whole island. As a result, several notable Irish players from this era, including Stevenson, played for both teams. FAI XI Between 1932 and 1948 Stevenson made 7 appearances for the FAI XI, making his international debut on 8 May 1932 in a 2‚Äì0 win against the Netherlands. His teammates that day also included fellow dual internationalists, Mick O'Brien, Jimmy Kelly and Paddy Moore. In October 1931 Stevenson had also played for a junior FAI XI against Scotland at Falkirk. However, Stevenson had to wait for fourteen years, partly because of the Second World War, before he made his second appearance for the FAI XI on 30 September 1946 in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to England. Puzzled by the fourteen-year gap between his first and second FAI cap, Stevenson apparently approached both the Everton secretary-manager, Theo Kelly, and the FAI secretary Joe Wickham for an explanation but neither was prepared to offer one. Stevenson, who was a Protestant, was accused in some quarters of refusing to play for the FAI XI on religious grounds, but he was adamant that religion had nothing to do with it on his part. He subsequently played for the FAI XI a further five times, helping them to a notable victory against Spain on 2 March 1947. He made his last appearance for the FAI XI on 5 December 1948 in a 1‚Äì0 defeat against Switzerland. However this was not his last involvement with the FAI. Between 1953 and 1955 Stevenson served as coach of the Republic of Ireland. IFA XI Between 1933 and 1947 Stevenson also made 19 appearances and scored 5 goals for the IFA XI, making his debut on 16 September 1933 in a 2‚Äì1 away win against Scotland, with the press praising his contribution.Disappointing Scots Half-Backs and Wing Men Weak, The Glasgow Herald, 18 September 1933 He subsequently formed a notable inside forward partnership with Peter Doherty. He scored his first goal for the IFA XI on 6 February 1935 in 2‚Äì1 defeat against England. He also scored against England in a 5‚Äì1 defeat on 23 October 1937. His remaining three goals were all scored against Wales in 1936, 1937 and 1947. On 11 May 1935, at Goodison Park, Stevenson also played for an Ireland/Wales XI in a 10‚Äì2 defeat against an English League XI. During the Second World War, he also played in two wartime internationals for the IFA XI. On 9 September 1944 at Windsor Park, he played an 8‚Äì4 defeat against a Combined Services XI. This team was basically a Great Britain XI and featured, among others, Matt Busby, Stanley Matthews, Tommy Lawton and Stan Mortensen. He also played in the Victory international against Scotland at Windsor Park on 2 February 1946. On 27 November, 1946 Stevenson was one of seven players who had been born in the Irish Free State, to be selected by the IFA to play against Scotland. The other six were Johnny Carey, Con Martin, Bill Gorman, Tommy Eglington, Peter Farrell and Davy Walsh. On 16 April 1947, he scored his last goal for the IFA XI in a 2‚Äì1 win against Wales. These two results helped the IFA XI finish as runners-up in the 1947 British Home Championship.

It is concerned with population size, with the three basic components of population change--fertility, mortality, and migration, and with population characteristics related to those components, such as marriage, socioeconomic status, and the configuration of families. Sources The sources of historical demography vary according to the period and topics of the study. For the recent period - beginning in the early nineteenth century in most European countries, and later in the rest of the world - historical demographers make use of data collected by governments, including censuses and vital statistics.Historical Demography in Encyclopedia of Public Health, Retrieved on 3 May 2005 In the early modern period, historical demographers rely heavily on ecclesiastical records of baptisms, marriages, and burials, using methods developed by French historian Louis Henry, as well as hearth and poll tax records. For population size, sources can also include the size of cities and towns, the size and density of smaller settlements, relying on field survey techniques, the presence or absence of agriculture on marginal land, and inferences from historical records. For population health and life expectancy, paleodemography, based on the study of skeletal remains, is another important approach for populations that precede the modern era, as is the study of ages of death recorded on funerary monuments. The PUMS (Public User Microdata Samples) data set allows researchers to analyze contemporary and historical data sets.Sylvia Andrews, \\"Public User Microdata Samples (PUMS): Do-lt-Yourself Census Data.\\" Indiana Libraries (2014) 13#2 pp: 19-26. Online Development of techniques Historical analysis has played a central role in the study of population, from Thomas Malthus in the eighteenth century to major twentieth-century demographers such as Ansley Coale and Samuel H. Preston. The French historian Louis Henry (1911-1991) was chiefly responsible for the development of historical demography as a distinct subfield of demography.Paul-Andr√© Rosental, The Novelty of an Old Genre: Louis Henry and the Founding of Historical Demography, Population (English edition), Volume 58 ‚Äì2003/1, Retrieved on 3 May 2007 In recent years, new research in historical demography has proliferated owing to the development of massive new population data collections, including the Demographic Data Base in Ume√•, Sweden,http://www.ddb.umu.se/index_eng.html, Retrieved on 3 June 2009 the Historical Sample of the Netherlands,http://www.iisg.nl/hsn/, Retrieved on 3 June 2009 and the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS).

The Deccan Riots of 1875 targeted conditions of debt peonage (kamiuti) to moneylenders. The rioters' specific purpose was to obtain and destroy the bonds, decrees, and other documents in the possession of the moneylenders.\\"Report of the Deccan Riots Commission\\", Parliamentary Papers, 1878, LVIII, paragraph 12. The peasants began a systematic attack on the moneylenders‚Äô houses and shops. They seized and publicly burnt debt bonds and deeds signed under pressure, in ignorance, or through fraud and other documents dealing with their debts. They socially boycotted the moneylenders. Within days the disturbances spread to other villages of the Poona and Ahmednagar districts. But there was no anti- colonial consciousness. The peasants failed to realize that the root cause of their distress was the British administration. Before the 1860s, 3/4th of the raw cotton imports of Britain came from America. British cotton manufacturers established Manchester Cotton Company in 1859 to encourage cotton exports. When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, the imports from America fell miserably. British started importing and securing cotton from India to maintain the cotton exports. So, they started giving advances to moneylenders who turned this into debts for ryot. Ryots in demand boom took a lot of credit and sometime forcefully given credit and made to sign bonds and deeds. The moneylenders used deceit and fraud to extract as much advantage as possible in this economic condition. After the civil war, the cotton demands fell drastically and moneylenders started recovering their money by charging high interests from ryots. Most of the time the ryots failed to pay back the debt and they were evicted from lands and lands were sold. This infuriated ryots who started violent protest against devious and deceitful moneylenders. They complained to authorities for grievance redressal. In 1859, the British passed Limitation Law that reduced validity of bonds for 3 years. This could limit the money paid by the peasants to the moneylenders. But, moneylenders started signing new bond for 3 years and at expiry signed new bond. Hence, it fuelled rebellion and riots. The movement continued for 2 months and spread to over 30 villages. It took several months for the police to restore order in the countryside. The Bombay government initially dismissed the uprising as trivial. However, the Government of India pressurized Bombay to enquire into the matter, and as a result Deccan Riots Commission was set up to enquire and investigate the reasons for riots. It submitted its report to British Parliament in 1878. In 1879, the Agriculturists Relief Act was passed which ensured that the farmers could not be arrested and imprisoned if they were unable to pay their debts. The movement had got support from the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha co-founded by M G Ranade.Many nationalist newspapers also supported the peasants. Bal Gangadhar Tilak played a very important role in the passage of Deccan Agriculturist Relief Bill. As Indian agriculture was drawn into the world economy, credit, commerce, inequality and growth were interrelated. The cultivators' distress resulted from falling agricultural prices, heavy taxation, and a sense of political powerlessness. The commercialization of agriculture under British land revenue policies burdened small peasants by placing a premium on access to credit to finance productive investments in the land. Employing capital advanced by European merchants, local moneylenders obtained unlimited title to the property and labor of their debtors; it gave them the \\"power to utterly ruin and enslave the debtor.\\"Report of the Committee on the Riots in Poona and Ahmednagar, 1875, Bombay (1876), p. 80. Quoted by Sven Beckert, \\"Emancipation and Empire: Reconstructing the Worldwide Web of Cotton Production in the Age of the American Civil War\\", American Historical Review, vol. 109, no. 5 (December , 2004). During the 19th century, they used this power to control peasant labour, and not their land, which was of little value without people to work it. These changes in agriculture undermined the communal traditions which had been the basis of Indian village life.Thomas R. Metcalf, \\"The British and the Moneylender in Nineteenth-Century India\\", The Journal of Modern History, Vol. 34, No. 4 (December 1962), pp. 390-397 Access to common resources declined steadily because various forms of joint use were misunderstood by the British, access to the forests was restricted, and the British redefined the state's relationship to pastoral communities. Vasudeo Balwant Phadke launched a violent campaign against British rule in 1879, aiming to establish an Indian republic by driving them out. However, his insurrection met with limited success. Someone betrayed Phadke to claim a bounty offered by the British; he was arrested and deported to Aden, where he died of a hunger strike in 1883.

For much of her career, Cole taught inner city children in the Los Angeles area. She wrote two books, Arts in the Classroom (1940) and Children‚Äôs Art from Deep Down Inside (1966), as well as several articles. Later in her career she held workshops and demonstrations on her method of teaching. Biography Cole used art extensively in her elementary classrooms. In addition to painting she led the children through life lessons using clay, free rhythmic dancing, and creative writing. Cole believed that the teacher‚Äôs job is to reach for the inner child artist and bring out h/her creativity, fostering to its fullest potential. She believed that children should have first hand experiences from which to draw creative ideas and expression from. These often took the form of common daily experiences both in and outside the school and field trips. Though her methods appear to be deliberately derived from the Progressive Movement, her involvement with progressive schools was little and informal if any. Cole lived and taught in Los Angeles, California while the Progressive Movement was largely contained in the East. Furthermore, progressive schools were largely elite private schools whereas Cole taught in urban public schools. A typical lesson in Cole‚Äôs classroom would be active and energetic. In painting, for example, students would often stand and paint on large sheets of paper. The subject matter would be of a personal experience by the child, either a story from home, or school, or a field trip. Cole would walk around the room offering gentle encouragement for the children to ‚Äòmake it your own way‚Äô and ‚Äòmake your pictures fill your paper till it bumps the sides.‚Äô Cole had her students paint large figures first, and then they could weave the details in between. Before moving to further concepts, Cole waited until a student reached that concept on their own and then she would offer praise and encourage the rest of the class to try out what that student ‚Äòdiscovered.‚Äô Cole practiced much patience with her students, often having students do ‚Äòwarm up‚Äô activities several times until the majority of the children ‚Äògot it.‚Äô For example, for a clay project making cows, she had her students play with the clay, doing their best to make a 3-D cow. The first day only two of the students ‚Äògot it‚Äô and she offered praise, and encouraged the students to do the same, and saved just their cows. Over the next few days, the students practiced making their cows, each day getting a little better at it. Finally, when the majority of the class had a good understanding of the medium, she fired and saved all their little cows. Cole also integrated concepts across the arts.

Early life and education Voliva was born on a farm in Indiana on March 10, 1870. In 1889, he entered Union Christian College, Merom Indiana; he graduated five years later and became a minister. In 1898 he was drawn to the teachings of John Alexander Dowie and eventually joined his congregation, becoming an elder of the Christian Catholic Church of Zion, Illinois. In 1901 he emigrated to Australia to become overseer-in-charge of the Australian branch. Leadership of church In September 1905, Dowie suffered a stroke and recuperated in Jamaica, claiming $2,000 a month expenses from the investments, and asked Voliva to return to oversee the city in his absence. Voliva arrived in February 1906, whereupon the congregation revolted against Dowie's leadership, accusing him of corruption and polygamy, and elected Voliva as head of the church, which he then renamed to the \\"Christian Catholic Apostolic Church.\\" By careful management he rescued Zion from bankruptcy, gaining the support of the church members. He kept tight control on his some 6,000 followers, which made up the community, even up to the point of dictating their choice of marriage partners. The city of Zion was effectively controlled by the church; all of its real estate, while sold at market rates, was conveyed under a 1,100 year lease, subject to many restrictions and to termination at the whim of the General Overseer. Religions other than the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church were effectively banned - visiting preachers from rival sects were harassed and hounded out of town by the city police force. Voliva diversified Zion Industries, an industrial concern owned by the church that manufactured Scottish lace, to include a bakery which produced the popular Zion brand fig bar cookies and White Dove chocolates. Zion was a one-company town and its workers were paid substandard wages. Voliva introduced many new rules for members and notices were placed around the town with stern warnings that the independents (who didn't belong to the church) resented and often burned. But the city was established as a safe space for those within its boundaries. Flat earth and other views From 1914, Voliva gained nationwide notoriety by his vigorous advocacy of the flat earth doctrine. He offered a widely publicized $5000 challenge for anyone to disprove the flat earth theory. The church schools in Zion taught the flat earth doctrine. In 1923 Voliva became the first evangelical preacher in the world to own his own radio station, WCBD, which could be heard as far away as Central America. His radio station broadcast his diatribes against round earth astronomy, and the evils of evolution. He was quoted about the sun as follows: He became increasingly focused on destroying the 'trinity of evils': modern astronomy, evolution and higher criticism, insisting on a strict interpretation of 24-hour days for creation and travelling to Dayton, Tennessee, to appear as a witness at the Scopes trial (he wasn't called). Voliva also predicted the end of the world would come in 1923, 1927, 1930, 1934 and 1935. Decline and death Like his predecessor, Voliva increasingly developed an overtly lavish lifestyle, amassing a $5m personal fortune by 1927, which began to alienate his followers, especially after the hardships brought on by the Great Depression, which forced Zion Industries into bankruptcy. In 1935 Voliva tried to revive the flagging fortunes of the church by instituting the annual Zion Passion Play, along the lines of the famous one in Oberammergau. However, in 1937, a disgruntled employee set ablaze the church's huge Shiloh Tabernacle, where the play took place. Shortly thereafter, Voliva was forced into personal bankruptcy and he was reduced to being the honorary president of Zion Industries. The governance of the city reverted to the independents and the new authorities selected a globe for the compulsory car sticker that Voliva was forced to put on his car. He spent most of his time in Florida where he hoped to establish another fundamentalist colony, but in 1942 after being diagnosed with terminal cancer, Voliva made a tearful public confession to his followers that he had misappropriated church funds for his personal use and committed other misdeeds. He died shortly thereafter on October 11, 1942 (though he had previously stated that he would live to 120 due to his diet of Brazil nuts and buttermilk), and the church all but dissolved. A small remnant was reorganized under the leadership of Michael Mintern. It was later renamed to \\"Christ Community Church.\\" NotesReferences * External links * * Poster banning smoking, erected by Voliva Category:1870 births Category:1942 deaths Category:19th-century apocalypticists Category:20th-century apocalypticists Category:American Pentecostals Category:Religious scandals Category:Flat Earth proponents ","title":"Wilbur Glenn Voliva"},{"id":"10818061","text":"\\"Wonderful One\\" is a popular song recorded by the Paul Whiteman Orchestra on January 25, 1923 in New York and was released as Victor 19019-B.Paul Whiteman and his Orchestra.

It was named after pre-American Civil War, U.S. Senator Stephen A. Douglas, but in 2020 the Park District voted to remove that name.

It is Sacramento Boulevard from 934 north to 1156 South and it is Sacramento Drive in Douglas Park according to Hayner, Don and Tom McNamee, Streetwise Chicago, \\"Sacramento Avenue/Sacramento Boulevard/Sacramento Drive\\", p. 113, Loyola University Press, 1988, On July 22, 2020, in consideration of a student-led petition to change the name, the Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners voted to immediately remove the park's name, beginning a 45 day comment period, with the view that the park will be renamed Douglass Park, for abolitionist Frederick Douglass. History This stone bridge pictured in front of the old Greenhouse is one of the few remnants of Jenney's original park designs. In 1869, the Illinois state legislature established the West Park Commission, which was responsible for three large parks and interlinking boulevards. Later that year, on November 4, 1869 the commissioners named the southernmost park in honor of Stephen A. Douglas (1813‚Äì1861). Best remembered for his pre-Civil War presidential defeat by Abraham Lincoln despite superb oratorical skills, Douglas was a United States Senator who helped bring the Illinois Central Railroad to Chicago. In 1871, designer William Le Baron Jenney completed plans for the entire West Park System which included Douglas, Garfield, and Humboldt parks. Jenney's engineering expertise was especially helpful for transforming Douglas Park's poor natural site into parkland. He had manure from the Union Stock Yards and sand added to the marshy site. This process brought the of land to grade level.Hueber, Jeff, \\"Chicago Parks Rediscovered\\", p. 57, Jannes Art Press, Inc., . In the center of the landscape, Jenney created a picturesque lake, and a small section of the park was formally opened in 1879. Inflated construction costs and post Great Chicago Fire tax collection difficulties resulted in phased projects. The first improvements were made to the park by Oscar DuBuis in the 1880s. Between 1886 and 1888 Douglas Park, like the other West Park System parks, replaced its greenhouse with a conservatory. In 1895, members of several German turners' clubs petitioned for an outdoor gymnasium, and the following year one of Chicago's first public facilities was constructed with an outdoor gymnasium (pictured right), swimming pool, and natatorium. 20th-century redevelopment This 1916 photo depicts the outdoor gymnasium. By the turn of the century, the West Park Commission was riddled with political graft, and the three parks became dilapidated. As part of a reform effort in 1905, Jens Jensen was appointed as General Superintendent and Chief Landscape Architect for the entire West Park System. Jensen, now recognized as dean of the prairie style of landscape architecture, improved deteriorating sections of the parks and added new features. Among Jensen's improvements were a semi-circular entryway at Marshall Boulevard, and a formal garden at the corner of Ogden Avenue and Sacramento Drive. By the time Jensen designed the garden, Ogden Avenue, a diagonal roadway with a major streetcar thoroughfare that would later become part of Route 66, had already been constructed. The road divided the park into two separate landscapes, creating a busy intersection at the junction of Ogden and Sacramento Avenues. Jensen's solution was a long axial garden on the southeast side of the intersection, providing a buffer between Ogden Avenue and playing fields to the south. Jensen demolished the conservatories in each of the West Park System parks in favor of one grand conservatory at Garfield Park. At the entrance to the garden, the area closest to the busy roadway intersection, Jensen placed a monumental garden shelter, known as Flower Hall, and a formal reflecting pool. The designer of the structure is unknown, however, it was possibly Jensen himself, or his friend, prairie school architect Hugh Garden. East of the building, the garden becomes more naturalistic. Jensen included perennial beds, a lily pool, and unique prairie-style benches. In 1928, the West Park Commission constructed a fieldhouse in Douglas Park. The structure was designed by architects Michaelsen and Rognstad, who were also responsible for other notable buildings including the Garfield Park Gold Dome Building, the Humboldt and LaFolette Park Fieldhouses, and the On Leong Merchants Association Building in Chinatown. In 1934, Douglas Park became part of the Chicago Park District, when the city's 22 independent park commissions merged into a single citywide agency. In 2017, students launched a petition to rename the park for Frederick Douglass and his wife, and presented a proposal to the park district broad in 2019. In 2020, noting it had never held a vote to change the name of any park from a historical person in its history, the Chicago Park District Board approved the change. Today The park has served as a central location for recreation since it was first built. It currently houses a miniature golf course, five playgrounds, an outdoor swimming pool, soccer fields, basketball courts, and an oval running track.Graf, John, Chicago's Parks Arcadia Publishing, 2000, p. 13., . The park also retains its original lagoon, a wide variety of trees, and the original Jenney designed stone bridge.Graf, John, Chicago's Parks Arcadia Publishing, 2000, p. 12., .

History=World War I The Brigade traces its historic title back to the First World War when the original 107th Infantry Brigade fought with distinction, alongside its sister formations of 108th Infantry Brigade and 109th Infantry Brigade, as the senior component of 36th (Ulster) Division. In September 1914 it was raised the 1st Brigade of that Division, but on 2 November 1914 it was renumbered 107. The 36th Division itself had been formed in September 1914 as part of the New Armies raised by Kitchener. It consisted of the old Ulster Volunteer Force, which had originally been raised to resist the imposition of Home Rule. Casualties throughout the War meant that many of the original battalions were to be amalgamated or disbanded as hostilities continued. In early 1918, on re- organisation, 107 Brigade consisted of the 1st and 2nd (Regular) and the 15th (Service) Battalions of the Royal Irish Rifles. In March 1918 the 36th Division, in the St Quentin Sector, was part of the Fifth Army and it was upon this Army that the main weight of the German Spring Offensive fell. The retreat which followed ended on 29 March and the Ulster Division moved north to the Ypres Salient. It thereafter took part in the successful offensive operations, which culminated in the cessation of hostilities in November 1918. The 36th Division was demobilised between January and June 1919, having suffered 32,186 casualties during the war. =Brigade commanders= Commanders were as follows: * Brig Gen Couchman CB until 20 Oct 1915 * Brig Gen W M Withycombe CMG DSO until 7 Mar 1917 * Brig Gen F J M Rowley DSO until 2 Jun 1917 * Brig Gen W M Withycombe CMG DSO until 20 Apr 1918 * Brig Gen E I de S Thorpe CMG DSO until 18 Sep 1918 * Brig Gen H J Brock CB CMG DSO =Order of battle World War I= From 5 November 1915 to 3 February 1916, the 107th Brigade was attached to 4th Division * 8th (Service) Battalion (East Belfast), Royal Irish Rifles (joined September 1914, 8th/9th Battalion from August 1917, disbanded February 1918) * 9th (Service) Battalion (West Belfast), Royal Irish Rifles (joined September 1914, amalgamated with 8th Battalion August 1917) * 10th (Service) Battalion (South Belfast), Royal Irish Rifles (joined September 1914, disbanded February 1918) * 15th (Service) Battalion (North Belfast), Royal Irish Rifles (joined September 1914) * 107th Brigade Machine Gun Company (joined 18 December 1915, moved into 36th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps on 1 March 1918) * 107th Trench Mortar Battery (joined from 1 April 1916) * 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Fusiliers (joined August 1917, left February 1918) * 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Rifles (joined February 1918) * 2nd Battalion, Royal Irish Rifles (joined February 1918) Post-World War II The second 107 Brigade was to be a Territorial Army formation. The Territorial Army throughout the United Kingdom was reconstituted in 1947 and, for the first time, there was a full scale TA organisation of all Arms in Ulster. Authority was given by the War Office for the formation on 1 January 1947 of 107 (Ulster) Independent Infantry Brigade (TA). Also at this time, Territorial infantry battalions of the three Regular infantry regiments of Northern Ireland were being formed, in addition to the various supporting Arms and Services. =Brigade commanders= * Brig N Russell CB DSO MC Late The Royal Irish Fusiliers 1 Jan 1947 * Brig T P D Scott CBE DSO Late The Royal Irish Fusiliers 7 Jul 1950 * Brig A G Mackenzie-Kennedy CBE DSO Late The Royal Scots 20 Aug 1952 * Brig J Drummond DSO Late The Royal Ulster Rifles 20 Aug 1955 * Brig G Wort CBE Late The Wiltshire Regiment 30 Aug 1958 * Brig H L S Young DSO Late Irish Guards 30 Aug 1961 * Brig R C P Jeffries MBE Late The Royal Irish Fusiliers 12 Nov 1962 * Brig A J Dyball MC TD Late The Royal Ulster Rifles 2 Dec 1965 ‚Äì 31 Mar 1967 =Postwar order of battle= The brigade had the following composition in 1947:Watson, TA 1947. * 661 (Ulster) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, at Bangor, County Down * 591 (Antrim) Independent Field Squadron, Royal Engineers, at Bangor * 107 Brigade Signal Squadron, Royal Corps of Signals, at Belfast * 5th Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers at Derry * 6th Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles at Belfast * 5th Battalion, Royal Irish Fusiliers at Armagh * 601 Company, Royal Army Service Corps * 107 Brigade Royal Army Ordnance Corps * 107 Brigade Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers * 107 Field Ambulance, Royal Army Medical Corps Modern times In July 1965 it became known that the reorganisation of the Territorial Army into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve would entail the disbandment of 107 (Ulster) Brigade on 31 March 1967. This was part of the complete reorganisation, announced in the 1966 Defence White Paper, which abolished the former regimental and divisional structure of the Territorial Army. A cell within Headquarters Northern Ireland then oversaw the administration of the Territorial Army in Northern Ireland until the decision was taken that 107 Brigade would again enter the British Army's Order of Battle and this took place on 2 November 1988. It was formed as an administrative headquarters to coordinate the TA units in Northern Ireland. It only became a deployable formation in the 1990s.

The DFK sees itself as naturistic sports organization, promoting family and recreational sports. DFK is a member of the German Olympic Sport Federation (DOSB) the largest member of the International Naturist Federation (INF). About 8000 young people are organized in the independent fkk-jugend e.V. History The DFK was established on 6 November 1949 as an umbrella organisation covering Germany's three former western occupation zones. It was entered in the register of associations at the district court of Hanover in 1953. Richard Ungewitter, one of the pioneers of the naturism movement, was awarded an honorary membership by the DFK in 1953, despite allegations of nationalist and anti-Semitic activities being levelled against him. The DFK is one of the INF's major net contributors. However, for several years during the 2000s the DFK criticised the INF's alleged misuse of membership fees, among other complaints. In 2007 the DFK threatened to leave the INF, but after a personal meeting between the heads of the two associations on August 18, 2007 the DFK remained a member.

Description  Psilocybe caerulipes has a farinaceous taste and a no to slightly farinaceous odor. *The cap is 1 ‚Äî 3.5 cm in diameter, obtusely conic to convex, and the margin is initially turned inwards, later becoming broadly convex to flattened or somewhat umbilicate while retaining a slight umbo, and at times quite irregular. The surface is viscid when moist from a gelatinous pellicle, but soon becomes dry and shiny, translucent-striate, and decorated with fine fibrillose veil remnants near the margin, often with greenish stains near the margin or a greenish tinge overall. It is cinnamon brown to dingy brown when fresh, hygrophanous, and soon fading to dingy ochraceous buff to cinnamon buff. The flesh is thin, pliant, bruising blue, sometimes slowly. *The gills are close to crowded, narrow with adnate to sinuate to uncinate attachment. They are light brown at first, becoming rusty cinnamon as the spores mature; the edges are whitish and slightly fimbriate. *The spores are dark purple brown, ellipsoid, 7‚Äî10 x 4‚Äî5 ¬µm from 4-spored basidia, thick-walled, and with a broad germ pore. The spores from 2-spored basidia are larger. *The stipe is 3‚Äì6 cm long, 1.5‚Äì3 mm thick, equal to enlarging downwards, tough, and is whitish to buff at first. The stipe is pallid to bluish when dried, becoming dingy brown towards the base with age, and bruises blue, sometimes slowly. The surface is powdered at the apex, and covered with whitish to grayish fibrils downwards. The flesh is stuffed with a pith and is solid at first but becomes hollow It lacks an annulus but sometimes remnants of the thin cortinate partial veil form a soon disappearing fibrillose annular zone in the upper region of the stem. *Microscopic features: The basidia are 2- and 4-spored. Pleurocystidia are absent. The cheilocystidia are 18‚Äî35 x 4.5‚Äî7.5 ¬µm, langeniform (swollen at the base, narrowed at the top), and with a thin neck, sometimes forked, 1‚Äî2.5 ¬µm broad at apices.Singer R, Smith AH. (1958).

Steckle served as the head football coach at the Nevada State University‚Äînow known as the University of Nevada, Reno‚Äîfrom 1901 to 1903 and Oregon Agricultural College‚Äînow known as Oregon State University‚Äîfrom 1904 to 1905, compiling a career head coaching record of 16‚Äì14‚Äì2. In 1903, his Nevada State Sagebrushers team, drawn from a school with 80 students, defeated the California Golden Bears. Early years Steckle was born in July 1872 at Freeman, Michigan. His father, Abraham B. Steckle, was born in Waterloo Township, Ontario, Canada, in 1842, and worked as a farmer. His mother, Sarah (Furtney) Steckle, was also a native of Waterloo Township. His parents were married in December 1867 in Waterloo County, Ontario.

University of Michigan Steckle played football for the University of Michigan from 1897 to 1899 and was captain of the 1899 team. In 1898, Steckle was among the first western players to be named to an All-American team after being selected by Walter Camp as his second-team tackle. He helped Michigan win its first Western Conference championship in 1898 and was selected as the best tackle in the West. One newspaper wrote that he was \\"as good a defensive player as one will find anywhere.\\" Coaching career=Nevada State From 1901 to 1903, Steckle served as the head football coach at the Nevada State University. In 1903, he was also appointed to the position as the university's Physical Director. In his three seasons as the head coach, he compiled a 6‚Äì9‚Äì2 record. When Steckle's Nevada Sagebrushers team defeated the California Golden Bears in 1903, it was the cause of a statewide celebration. The entire front page of the Daily Nevada State Journal was given to coverage of the game, and the banner headline read: \\"CALIFORNIA'S PROUD COLORS LOWERED BY THE DOUGHTY ELEVEN FROM SAGEBRUSHDOM.\\" Steckle's picture appeared on the front page, and the paper praised his efforts in turning Nevada into a football power: > Out of the eighty students of the N.S.U. have been selected eleven young men > who were moulded into shape by Dr. Steckle, the best football coach who ever > came to the Coast. He made of them the peers of the flower of the California > universities. The victory of a university with only 80 students over the University of California with its 3,000 students was hailed as a historic accomplishment, and \\"Coach Steckle's brand of 'roughhouse'\\" play was given much of the credit. Steckle's star players at Nevada State from 1901 to 1903 were his younger brother, Ivan X. Steckle, who played halfback, and Abe Steckle, who played tackle. Ivan Steckle was reportedly \\"the hero of all Nevada during the football season of 1903, when in a game with the University of California on the U.C. field, he grabbed the football close to the Nevada goal line and made a wonderful 86-yard run to the California goal line, scoring a touchdown for the Sagebrush players and bringing victory to the team.\\" Ivan left Nevada after the 1903 season to follow his older brother to the University of Michigan Medical School. Ivan died from typhoid fever in 1909, and Steckle accompanied his brother's body to the family's old home in Freeport, Michigan. In 1919, a Nevada newspaper rated Steckle as the best football coach Nevada ever had and described his accomplishments as follows: > It was under the coaching of Dr. Steckle that Nevada was able to defeat the > University of California and play a tie with Stanford as well as bang it > over the crack athletic club teams that San Francisco boasted when the great > college game was in its hey dey. He was rated at that time as one of the > best coaches in the West. Steckle was also remembered at Nevada for his ability to instill \\"college spirit\\" in the school's student body. In 1919, a Nevada newspaper noted that \\"there was more enthusiasm displayed in college athletics while he was coach than there has been in all the years since he left.\\" As a medical doctor and athletic coach, Steckle was also known for his belief in physical conditioning. He was known to require every athlete to be in perfect physical condition before playing in any intercollegiate or \\"big\\" game. Steckle was also a basketball coach. While at Nevada, he coached the women's basketball team to \\"a high stage of perfection, being able to take the measure of all the coast college teams.\\" Oregon State After his success with the 1903 Nevada State team, Steckle was offered a higher salary to take over as the football coach at Oregon State. He served as Oregon State's head coach from 1904 to 1905 and compiled a 10‚Äì5 record in those two seasons. Medical career After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1899, Steckle enrolled in the Illinois College of Physicians and Surgeons. Steckle's principal profession was as a medical doctor and surgeon. However, he took time out of his medical practice to coach college football for several years. After the 1905 football season, Steckle decided to quit coaching and focus on his medical practice. At the time of the 1920 United States Census, he was living in Vancouver, Washington with his wife, Margaret (born c. 1887) and two daughters, Catherine J. Steckle and Sarah E. Steckle.

R√©gamey introduced Hyde to the Japonism movement through his vast Japanese art collection. The paintings of Mary Cassatt, an American impressionist, were also very influential in Hyde's decision to focus on Japanese attributes in her works. Mary Cassatt's paintings were significantly inspired by Japanese works of art, and many of her paintings were women and children themes.Joan M.

The neighbourhood occupies land that was once part of the Hudson's Bay Company reserve. The community is represented by the active Queen Mary Park Community League, established in 1952, which maintains a community hall located at 117 Street and 108 Avenue.  Demographics  In the City of Edmonton's 2012 municipal census, Queen Mary Park had a population of living in dwellings, a 13.4% change from its 2009 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of people/km2 in 2012.  Residential development  Commercial area in Queen Mary Park along 107 Avenue (May 2008). It is bounded on the north by 111 Avenue, on the south by 105 Avenue, on the west by 121 Street, and on the east by 109 Street. The old Canadian National Railway right of way runs just to the south of and just to the west of the neighbourhood. The boundary of the south west corner of the neighbourhood is curved, following the right of way as it changes from an east-west direction to a north-south direction. Almost three out of four dwellings in the neighbourhood were constructed during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. A large percentage of the dwellings, almost four out of five, are rented. Almost 85% of the dwellings in the neighbourhood are apartments in low-rise buildings with fewer than five stories. Four out of five apartments are rented, with the remainder being owner occupied. Of the remaining dwellings, the majority are single-family dwellings, with roughly three out of four of these being owner occupied. There are a few duplexes, and most of these are rented. With construction of a new downtown arena and the expansion of MacEwan University, condo development has begun on the southern edge of Queen Mary Park spurring gentrification of the entire neighbourhood. New condo buildings include The Maxx, The Zen, The Horizon, and speculation of a nine-storey building abutting Oliver Square. The Holland Plaza, which was a garment factory for most of its past, opened in 2016 as a local business mall. It is anchored by Caf√© Linnea, which has been featured in the Globe and Mail and EnRoute Magazine. Holland Plaza also has Edmonton‚Äôs best brunch restaurant according to Avenue Magazine, the Local Omnivore, as well as the Wine Gallery and Doughnut Party. The average household size is 1.8 persons per household, with roughly one out of two households having only one person. Until recently, one of the most prominent structures in the neighbourhood was the Central Pentecostal Tabernacle. However, the congregation moved into a new church in north west Edmonton and the old building was sold. It was demolished in 2007. The neighbourhood is named after Mary of Teck, consort to George V, and therefore Queen of Canada from 1910 to 1936.

The TM format was maintained until 1981, when the station moved its tower and transmitter from Jackson to a location four miles east-north-east of the town of Springport, in the northwestern part of Jackson County and increased power to 50,000 watts in preparation to begin serving the larger Lansing market with a brand new format. (WJXQ can be heard as far away as Angola, Indiana, Alma, Michigan, as far west as Kentwood on the outskirts of Grand Rapids and as far east as Novi in the western suburbs of Detroit.) Q106 debuts On the afternoon of March 11, 1981, the call letters were switched to WJXQ. The station's power had more than doubled from a new tower site, giving it a strong signal into Lansing. Gone was the automated TM Stereo Rock format, and it was replaced by a Rock 40 format with high energy live air talent. The station also had a new moniker \\"Q106\\", WJXQ's very first song which was played March 18, 1981 was \\"Rock & Roll Never Forgets\\" from Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band. The original Q106 QJs which it was consisted of: Mornings: Patricia \\"Patty\\" Cheeks & Jimmy \\"Jim\\" Ryan Middays: Roger \\"The Big Dog\\" Sinclair Afternoon Drive: Jim Ryan Evening: Terry \\"Hester\\" Hesters Nights: Michael \\"Mike\\" Vaughn Overnights: Donald \\"Don\\" Poole Weekends: Jackson \\"Jack\\" Daniels Within three months, WJXQ claimed the #1 spot 12+ in the Lansing Arbitron ratings from relative obscurity. WILS-FM was hit hard and changed to an Adult Contemporary format in April 1984. The 1980s/1990s - WJXQ vs. WVIC The new Q106 would soon face tough competition from another Top 40 station, 94.1 WVIC, consulted by E. Alvin Davis. The two stations engaged in a Top 40/CHR formatted radio wars in the early and mid 1980s, from which WVIC would eventually emerge as the ratings leader. In the fall of 1985, Q106 dropped their rock 40 approach for a more teen bubblegum pop oriented top 40 and CHR sound, playing artists such as Madonna and Michael Jackson, trying to take on WVIC directly. But the effort ultimately failed and within two years WJXQ was gearing back towards a rock 40 format, this time concentrating on an AOR basis. And it was that here the station found its very own niche and Q106's ratings began to rebound. By the early 1990s Q106 had solid ratings helped in part by the success of the Debbie Hart and Timmy Barron morning show, which had developed a steady following. Then in January 1997 when Debbie and Timmy left the station for WVIC then Active Rock \\"Buzz 95\\" they were replaced by the syndicated Bob and Tom Show from Indianapolis' WFBQ, which remains popular on the station to this day. WJXQ briefly changed its moniker to \\"The All Brand Spanking New Q106!\\" in the fall of 1997. This was accompanied by a format modification toward Alternative Rock. The moniker returned to the legendary \\"Q106\\" within six months although the format modifications remained in place. In 2000, WJXQ was acquired by the Rubber City Radio Group based in Akron, Ohio.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2005 page D-273 On March 17, 2010 it was announced that the Rubber City Radio Group was planning to sell WJXQ, along with sister stations WWDK, WQTX, and WLMI to Midwest Communications. The deal officially closed on July 1, 2010. Midwest Communications later shifted WJXQ's city of license from Jackson to Charlotte, although the location of the transmitter and studios remained the same.

It is the heaviest aircraft the company has made to date, and will be able to transport up to of cargo, including wheeled armoured fighting vehicles. The first production aircraft was delivered on 4September 2019. On 18 November 2019, during the Dubai Airshow, Embraer and Boeing announced the new name of the aircraft, targeting the global market, C-390 Millennium. Development=Studies Between 2005 and 2007, Embraer intended to use the wing and GE CF34 engine of the mature Embraer E-190 with a cabin modified as a cargo hold with a rear ramp, closed-loop fly-by-wire and synthetic vision. The initial design was a high-wing E190. By 2006, Embraer was studying a military tactical transport design of a similar size to the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, powered by 17,000‚Äì22,000 lbf (75.6‚Äì98 kN) engines like the Pratt & Whitney PW6000 or Rolls-Royce BR715. In April 2007, Embraer reported it was studying a medium- size airlifter, with the company designation \\"C-390\\". The transport aircraft is to incorporate many of the technological solutions from the Embraer E-Jet family series and feature a rear ramp for loading and unloading a wide range of cargo. In March 2008, the Brazilian Government planned to invest about R$60 million (or US$33 M) in initial development of the aircraft and the Brazilian Air Force was simultaneously finalizing an initial purchase contract for some 22 to 30 aircraft, while Embraer was negotiating with possible partners. In May 2008, the Brazilian Congress released R$800 million (US$440M) to be invested in the project and development of the aircraft. The media also claimed that this aircraft is going to be used not only by the Brazilian Air Force, but also by their Army and Navy, with unconfirmed sales to other government agencies. Program launch The IAE V2500 turbofan was selected to power the C-390. On 14 April 2009, Embraer was awarded with a $1.5 billion contract to develop and build two prototypes. At the programme launch, the design was all-new, with a new fuselage cross-section, wing, engine and flight deck, beyond the E-190 limited wing surface and engines, to replace the operating envelope of the Brazilian Air Force's C-130s. In Embraer's view, the jet engine is sufficiently resilient to dust ingestion, whereas propeller tips close to the ground are susceptible to damage. Embraer also chose the IAE V2500 engine for efficiency in normal conditions rather than performance in unusual conditions like the Antonov An-32. In March 2010, Embraer drew up a development schedule, with the first prototype aircraft scheduled to be delivered in late 2014. In July, during the Farnborough Airshow, the Brazilian Air Force announced it will order 28 C-390s and Embraer announced an increase in the cargo capacity to . During the 2011 Paris Air Show, Embraer announced plans to launch a stretched version of the C-390 focused on the civil cargo market in 2018, with 200‚Äì250 predicted orders over a 10-year period. Two plugs will be added fore and aft of the centre fuselage section increasing internal capacity, but also providing for a side cargo door. In April 2011, Embraer estimated 695 military transport aircraft will need to be replaced during the following decade. Partnerships In August 2010, Argentine Defence Minister Nilda Garr√© announced that Argentina will participate in the construction of the aircraft. On 24 August, the defence ministers of Chile and Brazil signed an agreement for Chile's ENAER company to join the C-390 industry team. Colombia also signed an agreement to join the programme. On 10 September 2010, the defense minister of Portugal signed an intentions letter to join the programme. On 14 December 2011, Brazil and Portugal agreed a defense partnership with EEA engineering components to be built by Embraer's Portuguese subsidiary OGMA. In April 2012, Boeing and Embraer signed a cooperation agreement. In June, they partnered to develop the C-390 and possibly to sell it. Major subcontractors include Aero Vodochody for the rear fuselage section, Rockwell Collins for the avionics, BAE Systems for the fly- by-wire primary flight control system, ELEB for the landing gear, and Rockwell Collins for the cargo handling and aerial delivery system. International Aero Engines (IAE) supplies the V2500-E5 turbofans, its first military application. F√°brica Argentina de Aviones supplies the tail cone, cargo door and landing gear doors. Flight testing C-390 roll-out on 21 October 2014 Two prototypes were planned by the program. The first prototype (PT-ZNF) rolled out from the Embraer subsidiary plant, Embraer Defense and Security, at Gavi√£o Peixoto, S√£o Paulo on 21 October 2014, and flew for the first time on 3February 2015. In July 2015, the company announced a two-year delay in the flight test program, citing the devaluation of the Brazilian currency and government spending cuts. However, a second test flight took place at Gavi√£o Peixoto on 26 October 2015. By February 2016, the first prototype had logged more than 100 hours of flight. With the resumption of flight-testing, the manufacturer expected to certify the aircraft in 2017 and begin deliveries in 2018. The eight months between test flights were used to conduct ground vibration tests to validate aeroelastic models, as well as avionics, mission, landing gear and electric and hydraulic flight control system testing. Embraer has reported good availability for testing, sometimes doing two flights per day. The aircraft was tested to the limits of speed, Mach number, and altitude, as well as all slats, flaps and landing gear positions. The second prototype (PT-ZNJ) was finished in March 2016 and made the first flight on 28 April 2016. By then, Richard Aboulafia's Teal Group estimated the C-390 price at $50‚Äì55 million, $15 million less than the Hercules. On 17 October 2017, the first prototype (PT-ZNF) had an uncommanded descent from 20000 ft to 3100 ft at 4500 ft/min. In December 2017, as the two prototypes accumulated over 1,500 flight hours and laboratory testing over 40,000 hours, initial operating capability was reached while full operational capability was expected in 2018. On 5May 2018, the first prototype (PT-ZNF) ran off the runway during a ground test in Gaviao Peixoto, Brazil. The third C-390 built and first production aircraft first flew on 6October 2018. After 1,900 flight hours in testing, the C-390 received Brazilian civil type certification on 23 October 2018; the first production aircraft is to be delivered to the Brazilian air force in the first half 2019 and should obtain military certification by the end of 2019. The third aircraft (PT-ZNG), originally slated for the first delivery, has been redirected to complete certification. Joint venture and name change On 18 November 2019, Boeing (49%) and Embraer (51%) announced a joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium tactical transport aircraft, called Boeing Embraer ‚Äì Defense, to operate after the regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Design C-390 glass cockpit with fly-by- wire controls Embraer built the C-390 around the long, 3.45 m (11.3 ft) wide and high hold with a rear ramp. Its twin IAE V2500-E5 turbofans are mounted forward on the high wing with anhedral angle, slats and up to 40¬∞ flaps High- lift devices. The landing gear has low-pressure tires, two on the nose and four on either side bogies for soft, unpaved ground or damaged runways. Fly- by-wire flight controls with active sidesticks allows load factors up to 3g. The cockpit has head-up displays for the enhanced vision system with four cameras and Rockwell Collins Pro Line Fusion commercial avionics. The aircraft can carry : two fully tracked M113 armored personnel carriers, one Boxer or Brazilian VBTP-MR Guarani wheeled armored vehicle, a Sikorsky H-60 helicopter, 74 litters with life-support equipment, up to 80 soldiers or 66 paratroopers with full gear, and loads of up to can be air dropped. The C-390 can refuel in flight other aircraft through two wing-mounted probe and drogue pods from Cobham plc delivering up to per minute from a total fuel capacity, between and from . With extended slats, idle thrust and flight spoilers extended to 40¬∞, it descends at a rate of at its maximum IAS. With flaps full at 40 degrees, it stalls at IAS.

This requires her to move to Seattle from Portland. When she attends her first session, she is scrutinized by the coach about her weight and feels the pressure to lose the pounds. At first she adopts a sensible diet, but it soon leads to excessive calorie restriction. When she hangs out with a fellow team member, Leslie (Tara Boger), Leslie tells her that there are ways around it and encourages her to self-induce vomiting, saying, \\"You can eat what you want, and not gain a pound.\\" Andie continues restricting her calories, but when she cannot help eating due to extreme hunger, she resorts to purging methods. Her mom notices changes in her weight, while her boyfriend and best friend also notice changes in her attitude. Andie eventually tells her best friend that she sees the changes and can't stop her behavior. She faints twice, both during competitions, and goes to the hospital, after fainting the second time, where a doctor talks to her parents about her health problems. Her parents decide that she and her mother will move back home. Andie runs away to the gym, where she sees a new girl being given the same lecture about her weight that was given to her. She decides that she is not ready to go back to training. After moving back to Portland, Andie joins a support group where she is encouraged to eat as part of her therapy. At the end of the movie, she is seen walking into the school gymnasium and getting back on the balance beam.

Rudolf was active at Fulda Abbey in the present-day German state of Hesse. Many of his works have been lost. However, his Annals of Fulda and Life of St. Leoba survive. Life It is uncertain when Rudolf of Fulda was born. There exists no surviving record of his early ecclesiastical life. Furthermore, there exists no record of his family lineage. Only the date of his death is known from a reference made to \\"the late monk of Fulda\\" in a passage from the Annals of Fulda dated 865. He was a monk of the Benedictine monastery at Fulda. By the year 821, Rudolf was made subdeacon of the monastery (\\"... a cleric in the lowest of the former major orders of the Roman Catholic Church\\").http://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/subdeacon Rudolf was a devoted theologian, historian, poet and \\"...a most notable practitioner of all the arts\\".Reuter, Timothy. The Annals of Fulda: Ninth-Century histories. Volume II. New York: Manchester University Press, 2012. Print. Rudolf of Fulda was a pupil of Rhabanus Maurus and together they oversaw a collection of two thousand manuscripts, including a copy of Tacitus‚Äô Germania, which indicated the monastery's importance as not only a place of worship, but also a highly important library. Fulda Abbey also owned such works as the Res Gestae by the fourth-century Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus and the Codex Fuldensis, as well as works by Cicero, Servius, Bede and Supicius Severus. Work Rudolf is considered to be one of the most important writers of his time and wrote several works: *Annales Fuldenses (\\"The Annals of Fulda\\") were started by Einhard and continued by Rudolf (838‚Äì863). Most notable of Rudolf's work are the Annals of Fulda, composed between 838 and 901. First contributed by Einhard, Rudolf of Fulda continued the work from 838 to 863. The Annals of Fulda are considered to be one of the most fundamental primary sources of the 9th-century Carolingian period with works dating from 838 to 901. Within this work, Rudolf of Fulda makes direct reference to Tacitus‚Äô Germania. *Vita Leobae Abbatissae Biscofesheimensis', a biography of Saint Leoba of Tauberbischofsheim (most likely written in 836). Written and composed in the year 836, the \\"Life of St. Leoba\\" represents the first known biography of a Saxon woman and is one of Rudolf's most debated works. Scholarly critique surrounding this work has focused on the gender roles. The hagiography of St. Leoba is seen as a tool of reinforcing gendered roles, as Rudolf of Fulda alters St. Leoba's accomplishments and actions to reinforce the Benedictine reforms which occurred after her death. *Miracula sanctorum in Fuldenses ecclesias translatorum (843‚Äì847): This record is said to have been composed between 842 and completed before 847. In the introduction to the text, Rudolf of Fulda states that, ‚Äúhe wanted to write about the virtues and miracles, which God considered worthy to happen through his saints in the present day, of whom the holy relics were brought to our region, are brought out today for the faithful for their well being‚Äù.Raaijmakers, Janneke. The Making of the Monastic Community of Fulda c.744 - c.900. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2012. Print. With the help of this text, scholars and historians have been able to retrace the movement and arrival of relics which were brought to the monastery of Fulda. Rudolf of Fulda is diligent in recording the names of the individuals transporting the relics, the dates, as well as the routes travelled. With this information in hand, historians have at their disposal a well-written, first-hand account of relics acquired by the monastery of Fulda. *Translatio sancti Alexandri Wildeshusam anno 851 covers the conversion of the Saxons to Christianity and was begun in 863 at the request of Waltbraht, a grandson of Widukin. When Rudolf died in 865, the work was completed by Meginhart. Begun in 863, this text covers the conversion of the Saxons to Christianity, at the request of Walkbraht, the grandson of Widukin. Taken on in his final years of life, Rudolf of Fulda would not oversee the completion of his text. After his death, the work was continued and finally completed by Meginhart. The Translatio Sancti Alexandri Wildeshusam anno text of 851 conveys the conversion of the Saxon peoples to Christianity in Germany. Rudolf of Fulda once more makes reference to the works of Tacitus‚Äô De Germania‚Äô in the Annals of 852. *A commentary on the gospel of John, which is presumed to have been lost. Textual Analysis The study of Rudolf of Fulda's surviving work provides modern day scholars an insight into his personal beliefs and opinions. Through careful textual analysis, scholars, such as Margaret Cotter- Lynch, have provided a deeper rooted insight into his work. Textual analysis begins with two of his most prominent works: The Life of Leoba, (composed in 836), and the Annals of Fulda, (for which Rudalf of Fulda contributed to between 836 until his death in 865). Under the orders of Rhabanus Maurus, Rudolf of Fulda was given the task of composing the hagiography of St. Leoba (b.710 - d. 28 September 782), a Saxon nun whom achieved sainthood. This textual record represents a step in a new direction during the Carolingian period in which led to hagiography. This textual source provides us with a glimpse into the mindset of Rudolf of Fulda. Scholars such as Margaret Cotter- Lynch, author of Reading Leoba, or Hagiography as a Compromise and Valerie L. Garver, author of Women and Aristocratic Culture in the Carolingian World have pointed to the agenda interwoven within Rudolf of Fulda's Life of Leoba. The Life of St. Leoba was completed by Rudolf of Fulda at the request of Hrabanus. Most apparent in this text are the gender stereotypes of the ninth-century. In the Life of Leoba, Rudolf of Fulda clearly addresses what he believes to be the appropriate role of women in the ninth century. As Margaret Cotter-Lynch, author of Reading Leoba, or Hagiography as Compromise, states, ‚ÄúRudolf‚Äôs ideals concerning religious women‚Äôs behavior seem to align with the official positions of the ninth-century Carolingian church after the Benedictine reforms: religious women are to be strictly cloistered, focused on internal piety and prayer, with very limited if any engagement with either the ecclesiastical or secular worlds beyond the covent‚Äôs walls‚Äù.Cotter-Lynch, Margaret. Reading Leoba, or Hagiography as Compromise. Oklahoma: Southeastern Oklahoma State University, Web. Rudolf of Leoba's opinions coincide with a period in which ‚Äúlarge male communities dominated local religious, and also social, economical and political life‚ÄùRaaijmakers, Janneke.

He was born at Gelsenkirchen. Work Between 1936 and 1946 he was a professor at the University of W√ºrzburg, where he founded the Archiv f√ºr die Gew√§ssernamen DeutschlandsArchive for German Hydronymy. in 1942. Between 1947 and 1949 he held a chair at Heidelberg and from 1949 to the time of his death he was Professor f√ºr vergleichende Sprachwissenschaft und Slavistik and Leiter des indologischen und slavischen Seminars in the University of T√ºbingen. Krahe in his work of 1937 as a follower of Pan-Illyrian theory, discussed the Venetic language known from hundreds of inscriptions as an Illyrian language which, with the lower Italian Messapian and the Balkan Illyrian languages, forms the separate Illyrian branch of the Indo-European language family. Krahe thought that not only the name of the Illyrian and Adriatic Enetoi peoples are the same.He revised his opinion, that they were two different tribes (Krahe, 1950, 20); according to Steinacher (2002: 32), the Adriatic Veneti, the Veneti of Gaul and the North Balkan/Paphlagonian Enetoi mentioned by Herodotus and Appian were not related to each other, nor to the Veneti/Venedi mentioned by Tacitus, Pliny and Ptolemy. Homer mentions a people in Asia Minor, the Paphlagonians, as from the Enetai province,Homer, Iliad II, 852 and a few hundred years later Herodotus refers to the Enetoi twice, once as IllyrianHerodotus I, 196 and again as the occupants of the Adriatic sea.Herodotus V, 9 Krahe thought that the name of the Illyrian and Adriatic Enetos peoples are the same, and if Adriatic Enetoi were Adriatic Veneti (Venets) and Venets were the Vistula Veneti (Veneds) mentioned in other sources then Illyrians and Veneds were the same people. The basis of this theory is the similarity of the proper nouns and place names, but most of all in the water names of the Baltic and the Adriatic (Odra, Drava, Drama, Drweca, Opawa, Notec, etc.). Having the model of Illyrian in mind he assumed that together these elements represented the remnant of one archaic language. In his later work Krahe substituted Julius Pokorny's Pan-Illyrian theory concerning the oldest European river names with that of Old European hydronymy, a network of names of water courses dating back to the Bronze Age and to a time before Indo-European languages had developed in central, northern and western Europe.Krahe, Hans. Die Strukture der alteurop√§ischen Hydronomie (\\"The structure of Old-European river names\\") Wiesbaden, 1963; Krahe, Hans. Unsere √§ltesten Flussnamen (\\"Our oldest river names\\") Wiesbaden, 1964 In his 1949 essay Ortsnamen als Geschichtsquelle (\\"Placenames as sources for history\\") Krahe presented the analysis of hydronymy (river names) as a source of information both historical and prehistorical, with an extended analysis of the River Main as an example (Krahe 1949:17ff.) He examined the layers of European water names and did so using two theses. The first thesis was that the oldest layer will always be the one that can not be explained with the language of the people who currently live on the banks or shores of the given water, and/or consist of a monosyllabic stem carrying a meaning (at times derived or conjugated monosyllabic words). He found that these monosyllabic water names give a system which he called Alteurop√§isch (Old European).Krahe 1964:13 The network of old European water names comprises waters from Scandinavia to lower Italy, and from the British Isles to the Baltic. It denotes the period of development of the common Indo-European language which was finished by the second millennium BC. Hans Krahe claimed that by that time the Western languages (Germanic, Celtic, Illyrian, the so- called Italic group - the Latin-Faliscus, the Oscan-Umbrian along with Venetic-Baltic - and to some extent Slavic), though they still constituted a uniform Old European language which was to further divide later, had already dissociated from the ancient Indo-European language.Krahe 1964:32‚Äì33. The similarities in European water names resulted from the radiation of this old European system, and not from the resemblance of the common words in the later separate languages.Krahe 1964: 77) His assumption that the linguistic strata corresponded to ethnic strata came under critical reappraisal decades after his death, in the work of Walter Pohl and others.

In January 2007, Moghadam was appointed Director of the College of Liberal Arts' Women's Studies Program at Purdue University, where she is also a professor in the Sociology Department.

In March 1995, she was a member of the United Nations University delegation to the World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen. Later that year, in September, she also participated in the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing. She has also aided in the establishment of the Palestinian Women's Research and Documentation Center, located in Ramallah. Her book Modernizing Women: Gender and Social Change in the Middle East was recognized as a Choice Outstanding Academic Book for the 1993 to 1994 academic year. Research, influence and ideology Currently, Valentine Moghadam's areas of research include \\"globalization, transnational feminist networks, civil society and citizenship, and women's employment in the Middle East\\". Her experiences growing up in Iran influenced her political views, which became more defined in her university education. The Iranian Revolution of 1979 and the continued Islamization in Iran following the revolution made an imprint on Moghadam's ideology. This situation in Iran, and the situation for Iranian women that resulted, sparked her interest in gender politics. Following the conferral of her Ph.D., Moghadam turned her attention to women-in-development, and her identification as a feminist strengthened. Today, the global issues that most concern Moghadam are \\"the adverse effects of economic globalization, militarism,\\" and the fight for \\"women's rights everywhere, but especially in Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan\\".

The show was hosted by Marlon and Shawn Wayans at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The 2000 show is best remembered for Tim Commerford of Rage Against the Machine climbing a piece of set scaffolding and refusing to come down after his band lost the award for Best Rock Video to Limp Bizkit. The show went to commercial while security removed Commerford, who was later arrested and forced to spend a night in jail. Britney Spears performed her hit single \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" which went on to become one of the VMA's most iconic and controversial performances, due to her skin- colored performance attire. NSYNC also performed their hit single \\"Bye Bye Bye\\". Bizkit vocalist Fred Durst later joined Christina Aguilera onstage as a surprise guest during her performance of \\"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\\". For the second year in a row DMX did not show up for his scheduled performance; as a result, Nelly's performance, originally scheduled for the pre-show, was promoted to the main event. Other highlights included Eminem performing amidst an army of \\"Slim Shady\\" lookalikes and a humorous montage dedicated to past VMA winners who had failed to repeat their previous success. This was Aaliyah's last appearance at the VMA awards before her death a year later in August 2001 in a plane crash in the Bahamas.

They played in the League of Ireland between 1930‚Äì31 and 1936‚Äì37. In 1934‚Äì35 they were League of Ireland champions. After St James's Gate, Shamrock Rovers, Bohemians, Shelbourne and Dundalk, Dolphin became the sixth club to win the League of Ireland title. League of Ireland Rsssf In 1931‚Äì32 and 1932‚Äì33 Dolphin played in two successive FAI Cup finals, losing both games to Shamrock Rovers. FAI Cup Rsssf Between 1930 and 1931 and 1932‚Äì33 Dolphin also played in three successive Leinster Senior Cup finals, winning the cup in 1931‚Äì32. History=Leinster Senior League Dolphin was formed by a group of butchers in 1921, the same year the League of Ireland was founded. These founders included butchers of German origin whose families arrived in Dublin in the late 1800s and who were associated with the Butchers Club on Gardiner Street, Dublin. William Reinhardt was one of the founders . The club was called Dolphin F.C. as it first played in the Dolphins Barn area of Dublin. The club colours were blue and white. As the League of Ireland grew and expanded, it regularly recruited teams from the Leinster Senior League. This, in turn, created vacancies in the de facto second level league. In the 1920s Dolphin were one of several clubs who availed of this opportunity to join the Leinster Senior League. Others included Brooklyn, Brideville, Drumcondra, Bray Unknowns and Dundalk. All of these clubs were eventually invited to join the League of Ireland. After winning the Leinster Senior League title in 1929‚Äì30, Dolphin also followed this path. The following season a Dolphin reserve team would win a second Leinster Senior League title for the club. League of Ireland In 1930‚Äì31 when the League of Ireland was expanded from ten to twelve teams, Dolphin, together with Waterford, were one of the two new teams elected to join. In 1931‚Äì32 Dolphin reached two cup finals. In the Leinster Senior Cup final they defeated Shelbourne 1‚Äì0. In the 1931‚Äì32 FAI Cup final, with a team that included Larry Doyle, Jeremiah Robinson, Alex Stevenson, Jimmy Shiels and Johnny Somers, Dolphin played Shamrock Rovers. However this time they lost 1‚Äì0. In 1932‚Äì33, they reached a second FAI Cup final, once again against Rovers. This time the Dolphin team included George Lennox, Larry Doyle, Joe Kendrick, Jimmy Bermingham, Johnny Somers and Willie Fallon. On 3 March 1933 at Dalymount Park, a crowd of 32,000 witnessed a game which produced six goals, including three penalties, and finished 3‚Äì3. George Lennox, with two penalties, and Willie Fallon were the scorers for Dolphin. However the replay saw Rovers win 3‚Äì1. Dolphin enjoyed their most successful season in 1934‚Äì35, when they won both the League of Ireland title and the Dublin City Cup. They also finished as runners up in the League of Ireland Shield and reached the semi-finals of the 1934‚Äì35 FAI Cup. In 1935‚Äì36 three Dolphin players ‚Äì Ray Rogers, James Leonard and Eddie Carroll ‚Äì scored 16 goals or more goals. They scored 56 of their team's 66 goals between them that season and were largely responsible for Dolphin finishing as League of Ireland runners-up. However, at the end of the 1936‚Äì37 Dolphin resigned from the League of Ireland and were replaced the following season by Limerick. League of Ireland Rsssf FAI Cup Rsssf Dublin City Cup Rsssf League of Ireland Shield rsssf A Beautiful Friendship Grounds Dolphin originally played their home games at Dolphin Park, the same park now used by Kevin's Hurling Club. They continued to play there throughout their time in the League of Ireland. However, between 1932‚Äì33 and 1933‚Äì34 they also played some games at Harold's Cross Stadium. During their final two seasons in the league, 1935‚Äì36 and 1936‚Äì37 they also played some games at Tolka Park.

The story takes place at the dawn of the 21st century, when Earth is overrun by giant robots. Daisaku Kusama encounters one of these monsters, the titular Giant Robo, in a ruin in Okinawa. Beckoned by forces he cannot understand, Daisaku is made to bond, body and spirit, with the ancient weapon and defend his homeland from the incoming evil. A pilot for the show was made in 2005, which was a selection of scenes from the 1967 manga in animated form.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gALLSv7xD2w Due to a change in staff at SoftGarage, the idea of a faithful adaptation of Giant Robo was scrapped in favor for a modern world view, not unlike that of Neon Genesis Evangelion.

The position had been authorized by Congress on September 24, 1789, with the position's purpose being to \\"enter and record all the orders, decrees, judgments and proceedings of the said court.\\" The Judicial Code (28 U.S.C. ¬ß 671) provides that the Clerk is appointed, and may be removed, by order of the Supreme Court. The Clerk's duties are prescribed by the statute and by Supreme Court Rule 1, and by the Court's customs and practices. The Clerk of the Supreme Court is a court clerk. The role of the clerk and deputies or assistants should not be confused with the Court's law clerks, who assist the Justices by conducting research, making recommendations on which cases to hear, and preparing drafts of opinions. The Clerk's Office is responsible for maintaining the dockets and records of the Court. However, since approximately 1960, most of the Court's non-current case files and other records have been placed in the custody of the National Archives and Records Administration. The Clerk is one of the Court's four statutory officers. The others are the Marshal, the Librarian, and the Reporter of Decisions. Traditionally unlike others, the Clerk and deputies wear morning coats when performing their duties as the court is in session.William Suter, Clerk of the U.S. Supreme Court, interview, C-SPAN U.S. Supreme Court Week One of the traditional duties of the Clerk was holding the Bible at presidential inaugurations. James R. Browning became the last Clerk to perform this duty at John F. Kennedy's inauguration on January 20, 1961. Four years later, at Lyndon B. Johnson's inauguration, Lady Bird Johnson began the tradition of the First Lady holding the Bible, which continues today.

He earned seven caps with the U.S. national team. Since retiring, Etherington has coached youth soccer and is a soccer equipment salesman. Youth Etherington was born in England but migrated to the U.S. with his family when he was fifteen. His family settled in Virginia where he attended Mount Vernon High School in Alexandria, Virginia, playing both soccer and as a placekicker on his high school football team. Etherington was also a member of the United States U-20 men's national soccer team in 1976 as it attempted to qualify for the 1977 FIFA World Youth Championship. Etherington scored six goals to go with striker partner Rick Davis who scored eight. Despite their outstanding production, the U.S. finished third in the CONCACAF and did not qualify for the tournament. In 1976, The New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League sign 18-year-old Gary Etherington. The previous spring he was on the Annandale, Virginia team that beat Westport in overtime, in Westport, in the Eastern U.S. finals, then went on to capture what is now the U-19 McGuire Cup national championship. The Annandale Cavaliers defeated Fountain Valley, California 4-0 in the semi- finals and Sparta of Chicago (3-0) in the finals. Future Cosmos teammate Ricky Davis played for Fountain Valley. NASL After graduating from high school, Etherington chose to bypass college and turn professional. He signed with the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League in 1977 as an amateur player and saw time in ten games that year. However, 1978 was considered his first professional season with the Cosmos. As such, he earned NASL Rookie of the Year honors that season. Etherington remained with the Cosmos for only one more season before being traded to the Los Angeles Aztecs before the 1980 season. While Etherington had begun as a forward with the Cosmos, his lack of production had led to his move to the midfield. When the Aztecs traded Etherington to the San Jose Earthquakes at the end of the 1980 season, Etherington found himself at right back for the 1981 season. However, in 1982, he was back in the midfield. Etherington moved once more, this time to the Minnesota Strikers for the 1984 NASL season, the last for the league as it folded at the end of the season. MISL The Earthquakes entered Major Indoor Soccer League for the 1982‚Äì1983 indoor season. Etherington began the season with San Jose, but on January 20, 1983, the Earthquakes traded Etherington and Gordon Hill to the New York Arrows for Steve Zungul. At the time the Earthquakes played in both the NASL and MISL while the Arrows played exclusively in the MISL. With this move, Etherington got his first taste of indoor soccer. The Arrows folded at the end of the 1983‚Äì1984 season and Etherington moved to the Minnesota Strikers for the 1984 NASL outdoor season. When the NASL collapsed in 1984, the Strikers moved to MISL. Etherington remained with the Strikers and spent the next four seasons with them playing indoor soccer. In 1987, he played in the MISL All Star game.8th MISL All Star Game In 1988, Etherington moved to the San Diego Sockers for one last season before retiring from playing professionally.\\"Crow, Etherington sign with Sockers\\" San Diego Union Saturday, August 20, 1988 He had knee surgery during the pre-season, came back to play ten games then retired in January 1989.\\"Etherington ends career\\" Evening Tribune (San Diego) Friday, January 13, 1989 National team Etherington earned seven caps with the U.S. national team between 1977 and 1979.

The attack killed nine RUC officers and injured almost 40 others; the highest death toll ever suffered by the RUC. Afterwards, a major building scheme was begun to give police and military bases better protection from such attacks. Background In the early 1970s, after the onset of the Troubles, the Provisional IRA launched a campaign aimed at forcing the British to withdraw from Northern Ireland. The IRA‚Äîparticularly its South Armagh Brigade‚Äîhad repeatedly attacked the British Army and RUC with home-made mortars, but with limited success. Between 1973 and early 1978 a total of 71 mortar attacks were recorded, but none caused direct British Army or RUC deaths. There were only two deadly mortar attacks before 1985. The first was on 19 March 1979, when Private Peter Woolmore of the Queen's Regiment was killed in a mortar attack on Newtownhamilton British Army base. The second was on 12 November 1983, when an RUC officer was killed and several hurt in a mortar attack on Carrickmore RUC base. Attack The attack was jointly planned by members of the South Armagh Brigade and an IRA unit in Newry. The homemade mortar launcher, dubbed the 'Mark 10', was bolted on to the back of a Ford lorry that had been hijacked in Crossmaglen. Shortly after 6.30 pm on 28 February, nine shells were launched from the lorry, which had been parked on Monaghan Street,McKittrick, David. Lost Lives: The Stories of the Men, Women and Children who Died as a Result of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Random House, 2001. pp.1011‚Äì1012 about from the base.\\"I.R.A. MORTARS KILL 9 AT ULSTER BASE\\". The New York Times. 1 March 1985. Retrieved 28 February 2015. At least one 50 lb shell landed on a portacabin containing a canteen, where many officers were having their evening tea break. Nine police officers were killed and 37 people were hurt, including 25 civilian police employees; the highest death toll inflicted on the RUC in its history. The nine dead officers ranged in age from 19 to 41, seven male and two female, seven Protestants and two Catholics. Another shell hit the observation tower, while the rest landed inside and outside the perimeter of the base. Aftermath The day was dubbed \\"Bloody Thursday\\" by the British press. British prime minister Margaret Thatcher called the attack \\"barbaric\\", while Ireland's Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, said it was \\"cruel and cynical\\", and pledged the help of the Irish security forces to catch those responsible. Although not involved in the attack, Newry IRA member Eamon Collins was arrested shortly afterwards and interrogated. After five days of questioning, Collins broke under interrogation and turned supergrass, leading to more than a dozen arrests of other IRA members. The attack prompted calls from unionist politicians to \\"increase security\\", and the British government launched a multi-million pound programme of construction to protect bases from similar attacks. This involved installing reinforced roofs and building blast- deflecting walls around the base of buildings. After the successful attack in Newry, the IRA carried out a further nine mortar attacks in 1985. On 4 September, an RUC training centre in Enniskillen was attacked; 30 cadets narrowly escaped death due to poor intelligence-gathering by the IRA unit responsible. The cadets were expected to be in bed sleeping, but were instead eating breakfast when the bombs landed. In November 1986, the IRA launched another attack on the RUC base in Newry, but the bombs fell short of their target and landed on houses. A four-year-old Catholic girl was badly wounded and another 38 people were hurt, prompting the IRA to admit that \\"this incident left us open to justified criticism\\". Beginning in the 1990s, operations at the Corry Square base were progressively shifted to a new facility on the outskirts of Newry. The base was closed in 2002, and a park occupies the site today.

Llanwrthwl lies off the A470 road, north by road from Builth Wells and Newbridge-on-Wye and south of Rhayader. It lies on the River Wye and River Elan and the village is accessed by a bridge over the Wye. In 1833, its population was 517; its population in 1841 was 568; in 1845, its population was 563. In 2005 the community had a population of 201, an electorate of 137 and a council of seven members.\\"FINAL PROPOSALS, Community No. B23 - LLANWRTHWL\\" at powys.gov.uk Etymology Llanwrthwl, composed of an Upper and a Lower division, derives its name from the dedication of its church. History St Gwrthwl, a saint whose date is uncertain, founded the church at Llanwrthwl; he is commemorated on 2 March. Bronze Age gold work was discovered at Llanwrthwl in the 1950s, including a four-flanged bar torc, a circular sectioned bar torc, a square sectioned bar torc and a twisted ring. A commemorative stone, from the precincts of the extinct chapel of Llanwrthwl, was found at Maes Llanwrthwl (Llanwrthwl Field) with a Paulinus monument and the epitaph: Talorm  Adventvh  MAQVERIGH  FIUIVS. It was in several pieces, and at least one of those pieces was missing. It was later preserved and housed at the residence of the Jones family at Dolau Cothi, Carmarthenshire. The parish was a prebend in the Collegiate Church of Brecknock and the church was dedicated to St Gwrthwl. In 1840s there was a day school in the upper part of the parish, attended by about 30 children. There was also a Sunday School. A sum of ¬£16 was divided among the poor in January of each year, arising partly from a 1648 bequest by Edward ab Evan of the farm Cae'r Llan. Geography Old Bridge, Elan Valley In the 19th century, Llanwrthwl was in the county of Brecknockshire, and was a parish in the hundred of Buallt. The village is situated upon the River Elan, near to its union with the River Wye, about three miles, south by east, from Rhayader. Llanwrthwl parish is situated at the northern extremity of the county, bordering upon Radnorshire, from which it is separated on the north and north-east by the River Wye, and on the west and north-west by the streams of the Claerwen and Elan, which fall into that river, on the northeastern confines of the parish. The rivulets Runnant and Dulas are the principal of the smaller streams that intersect the parish. It comprises about of extremely irregular surface, rising in some parts into lofty hills, alternated with large tracts of level ground, forming extensive commons and bogs. The soil on the higher grounds is rocky, and in the lower generally of a marshy nature, but on the banks of the Wye and Elan there are some fertile meadows. The surrounding scenery is diversified, and in many parts highly picturesque. Copper ore has been found near the junction of the Elan with the Wye. On the hills are several cairns, especially on the height named Drygarn, or Derwydd Garn, implying \\"the Druid's rock, or mount,\\" part of which is in the adjoining parish of Llanfihangel Abergwesyn. There are also some cairns on an eminence of less elevation, designated Gemrhiw. On Rhos- Saithmaen, or \\"the Seven Stone common,\\" which is partly in this parish, and partly in that of Llanafan, are some stones very irregularly placed. Near this common is another, called Rhos-y-Beddau, or \\"the common of the graves,\\" the name of which would appear to commemorate some great battle, probably that of Llechrhyd. Notable landmarks Penuel Congregational Chapel St. Gwrthwl's Parish Church churchyard has a prehistoric standing stone about high near the south porch. Its upper part appears to have been broken, though it may be the shaft of a cross, or of Druidical origin. On Rh√¥s Saith-maen, or the \\"Seven Stone Common\\", in Llanwrthwl parish, are some very irregularly placed stones, though it has not been determined if they are of military, sepulchral, or Druidical remains. Penuel Congregational Chapel is located just south of the main village. The chapel was built in 1832 and rebuilt in 1890 in the Vernacular style with a long-wall entry plan. A register of baptisms for the years 1834-1837 is held by the National Archive. The Living Willow Theatre (in Welsh, Gl√¥b Byw) is at Penlanole near the village. It is an open-air theatre constructed of living willow trees\\"As You Like It\\" at shakespearelink.co.uk and occasionally outdoor performances of William Shakespeare are staged. In the early 1800s engineer James Watt retired to Doldowlod House, about a mile south of Llanwrthwl on the A470 road, when he left Birmingham. By 1891, the grand Glan-Rhos House had been built to the north of the village with surrounding grounds laid out stretching down to the river. Flora Alchemilla arvensis, Chrysanthemum segetum, and Galeopsis versicolor, have been found in Llanwrthwl, while Euphorbia helioscopia has been found nearby.

They were all-metal, parasol-wing monoplanes that seated the pilot and observer in tandem open cockpits. The aircraft were widely used in the Battle of France, but were all scrapped soon thereafter. Development The ANF Les Mureaux 110 originated with a French air ministry requirement for an aircraft to replace the Breguet 19 in Arm√©e de l'Air service in the \\"R2\\" reconnaissance role. Two slightly different variants, the 110 and 111 were presented to the air force for evaluation, and were soon ordered into production. The first mass- production version was the 113 in 1933, of which 49 examples were purchased. This was supplanted in production by the 115 in 1935 and the 117 later than year. Both these series were given light bombing capability as well. Operational history The 113 entered service initially with the Arm√©e de l'Air's reconnaissance Groupes, followed by the observation Groupes, and finally replacing the venerable Potez 25s in the Groupes A√©riens R√©gionaux reserve units. It was followed into service by the 117 and 115. From 1934 to 35, 40 of the original 113s were converted into night fighters and used to replace the Breguet 19s still in service with France's two nightfighter Groupes. By the outbreak of World War II, the 115 equipped nine Groupes A√©riens d'Observation, and the 117 nine more. By April 1940, 11 aircraft had been lost in action, leaving 228 on strength at the commencement of the Blitzkrieg in May. By the time of the French armistice with Germany on June 25, only 62 remained, some of these in North Africa.

It was produced by ATV. The series producer was Mickie Most, who was inspired to make the programme after he saw an interview with Top of the Pops' producer Robin Nash, in which he (Nash) boasted that TOTP was a music programme that the whole family could enjoy together. Most set out to make a show which was the antithesis of that, and which featured live music performances most closely related to the then emergent punk rock and new wave music scenes - though it also included other more mainstream artists such as Dire Straits and Lindisfarne as well as more original artists such as Kate Bush. Peter Cook played the manager of the fictional ballroom where the show was supposedly taking place, and frequently made disparaging remarks about the acts appearing. Chris Hill played the \\"king of the kids\\", a loudmouthed character whose role was to stir up the live audience. Birmingham DJ Les Ross ran a hamburger stand while sharing rock trivia and hosting the Revolver Reviver spot. Revolver was recorded in front of a live audience in Birmingham, UK. Artists featured that subsequently became more famous were: Ian Dury & The Blockheads, The Jam, Elvis Costello and David Coverdale/Whitesnake. Other notable artists included Alberto Y Lost Trios Paranoias, XTC, Tom Robinson Band, Nick Lowe, Steel Pulse, The Vibrators, The Stranglers, Buzzcocks, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Rezillos, Bonnie Tyler, The Fabulous Poodles, The Boomtown Rats, The Motors, Suzi Quatro, X-Ray Spex, The Tourists, stunt performer Eddie Kidd performing \\"Leave it to the Kidd\\", The Rich Kids, and The Only Ones. Revolver was originally slated as a prime time show, but due to the controversial nature of punk at the time, it was scheduled in a graveyard slot by some ITV regions. It consequently received poor ratings and did not return for a second series.

Published in 1966, it is among the most powerful of all Ross Macdonald's novels and was his own personal choice as his best book.Cited in Nolan 2017  Plot summary The plot is typically intricate: Peter Jamiesen, the jilted boyfriend of the formerly wealthy Virginia Fablon, hires sleuth Lew Archer to investigate the background of Francis Martel, a man of mysterious wealth, grandiose claims, and violent threats. Fablon and Martel quickly wed after Archer's arrival. The resulting inquiries take Archer from the homeless to the wealthy, a canvassing seen in other Macdonald novels. Archer links Martel and Fablon to old gambling debts and a suicide that might have been murder. Except for brief forays into Las Vegas (the title refers to cash skimmed by casino operators to avoid taxes) and the environs of Los Angeles, the action takes place around Montevista. A wealthy enclave, Montevista is characterized by private clubs, opulent homes and exclusive medical clinics. The plot's implications, however, reach beyond California, as the edges of the story extend to Central America and Europe, whose cultures and economies the book sees as inextricably tied to American life.  Style  Macdonald commented on his novel that he had spent some twenty years thinking about and taking notes for Black Money. It was \\"the longest I have held a book in mind before I wrote it\\". He also mentioned as formative influences his visit to Panama as a seaman in 1946 and F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925);Quoted in Nolan 2017 it is no accident that Fitzgerald is mentioned once in the text itself. Matthew Bruccoli draws a parallel between the themes of Fitzgerald there and Macdonald's novel.

That's the converse of the golden rule\\"), Black Money maintains the speed of a thriller at the same time as it manipulates the reader's understanding of its characters so as to render them icons of their classes and to lay bare their psychological tropes and moral dimensions. As in Fitzgerald, the glittering surface conceals debilitating corruption. The compression of the writing augments its emotive force, notably in the complex final scene, which, without having the \\"jolt\\" (to use the author's own word) of The Chill (1964), has an accretive force that gives it even greater power‚Äîthat of tragedy.

Etymology Gary is likely derived from compound names of Germanic origin, composed of the element gar (\\"spear\\"). A variant form of Gary is Garry, the spelling of which has been influenced by that of Barry. An informal pet form of Gary is Gaz, a variant of which is Gazza. A given name associated with Gary and Garry is Garrison; the latter is sometimes borne by sons of men bearing the former names. The Gaelic Garaidh is also associated with Gary. Gary is also a popular name in India and is often stylized as Garry or ‡§ó‡•à‡§∞‡•Ä. Because of the \\"Gare\\" sound at the beginning, Gary is sometimes incorrectly thought to be a diminutive of Garrett, even though the two names are not related in any way. History The usage of Gary as a given name is intertwined with the success of the actor Gary Cooper (originally Frank Cooper). The American industrialist Elbert Henry Gary left his name to the town of Gary, Indiana. The theatrical agent Nan Collins, who lived in this town, suggested the name Gary to Frank Cooper, one of her clients. Cooper thus adopted the name Gary and enjoyed a successful film career (as Gary Cooper) which caused the name to become popular. The name's popularity was further maintained by the popularity of cricketer Gary Sobers (whose first name was actually a pet form of Garfield), footballer Gary Lineker (b. 1960), and musician Gary Glitter (originally Paul Gadd). According to the Social Security Administration,Social Security Administration ‚Äì Popular Baby Names Gary was relatively rare as a given name in the 1900-1920s period (e.g., in the 1910s it was the 677th most frequent name, given to less than 0.01% of the babies born in that decade). In the 1930s, 0.38% of the male babies in the United States were named Gary, and in the 1950s as many as 1.54% of the male babies were given this name, making it the 12th most popular given name of that decade. The name Gary reached its record popularity (9th place) in 1954, the year after Gary Cooper received his Best Actor Academy Award for his leading role in High Noon. Since then, the popularity of Gary as a given name in the United States has been on a very slow, but steady decline.

She went from being the daughter of a hard-scrabble California miner to become heiress to a fortune in Comstock Lode gold and silver, the wife of steamship magnate Hermann Oelrichs, mistress of the Rosecliff estate in Newport, Rhode Island, and a member of the elite \\"Triumvirate\\" of American society.\\"  Early life  Tessie was born on June 30, 1871 in Virginia City, Nevada. Her father, James Graham Fair, was born in Clogher, County Tyrone, and immigrated to the United States from Belfast, Ireland in 1843 at age twelve. He worked the California mines until 1860, when he moved to Nevada to work the newly-discovered traces there. He met Theresa Rooney, an innkeeper's daughter, and they wed in 1861. Tessie grew up in mining camps as her father prospected for gold and was the eldest of four children born to her parents, including Virginia (nicknamed \\"Birdie\\"), Charles and James, Jr. In 1873, her father and three partners, discovered the \\"Big Bonanza\\" in Virginia City, Nevada, which became the largest single deposit of gold and silver ever found. More than $100 million dollars worth of gold (over $2.5 billion in today's currency) was extracted from that mine before it was exhausted in 1898. Fair used his share to expand into railroads and real estate, generating a fortune of $50 million. Money led to a dissolute life of affairs and drinking for him, and in 1883 his wife filed for divorce, getting custody of Tessie and Virginia. Personal life Rosecliff's dining room in the Louis XVI style, 1905.Rosecliff's staircase, 1905.Rosecliff's rear steps. In 1889, in Newport, Tessie met steamship tycoon Hermann Oelrichs, whom she wed the following year on June 3, 1890. The lavish wedding was held in San Francisco. James Fair's gift to his daughter was one million dollars, but even so he was not invited to the wedding. Now a wealthy heiress, Tessie moved east permanently to join the social circles of New York, Newport and Europe. Tessie later gave birth to her only child: * Hermann Oelrichs, Jr. (1891‚Äì1948), who married Dorothy Haydel (1893‚Äì1961) in 1925. After his death, she married Prince Ferdinand von Liechtenstein (1901‚Äì1981) in 1950. She publicly acted as a devoted and happy wife, but privately, she and Hermann were estranged. When news reached her that he survived the massive San Francisco earthquake of 1906, she hoped for a reconciliation. Hermann returned east, so she prepared a lavish supper for them together. When he did not attend, she was enraged. Unreconciled, Hermann later died of a heart attack. He left his full estate to his brother Charles May Oelrichs, thinking that Tessie would be content with her own fortune, but Tessie contested the will. Eventually, they settled the dispute and she received half of the estate.Gavan, Terrence. The Barons of Newport: A Guide to the Gilded Age. Newport: Pineapple Publications, 1998. Oelrichs died at Newport on November 22, 1926. After a funeral in the \\"beautiful blue and gold tapestry room\\" at Rosecliff, which was attended by Charles M. Oelrichs and his wife among others, she was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery, The Bronx, New York City. Her son inherited the vast majority of her estate with the provision that should he die without issue, her sister Virginia would be the residuary legatee. Her son later sold her stately home in 1941, and today, Rosecliff stands open to the public. Society life Tessie's social peers, Alva Vanderbilt and Grace Vanderbilt, already had expensive mansions in Newport, which were called \\"summer cottages\\" by the elite of the day. Tessie set her sights on being mistress of her own grand estate, so she commissioned architect Stanford White to renovate their recently purchased Rosecliff on Bellevue Avenue. Begun in 1899, and purchased from the estate of George Bancroft, Rosecliff was modeled after the Grand Trianon at Versailles, and was completed in 1902 with a final cost of $2.5 million. In 1899, Tessie orchestrated a coup for the family by marrying her younger sister Birdie off to William K. Vanderbilt II, son of Alva and William K. Vanderbilt and brother of Consuelo Vanderbilt, Duchess of Marlborough, in a wedding that was extensively covered in the society pages. In New York, they lived at 1 East 57th Street in \\"the big house at the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and Fifth-seventh Street,\\" which was later occupied by the New York Trust Company. Oelrichs then lived at 1 East 72nd Street. After the \\"retirement\\" of Caroline Schermerhorn Astor (The \\"Mrs. Astor\\"), Tessie ruled American society as one of the so-called Triumvirate, made up of herself, Mamie Fish and Alva Belmont. Where Alva was the extravagant hostess and Mamie threw exotic and often raucous parties, Tessie was known as the martinet, the drill sergeant, of the three, enforcing the rules of polite society. Hermann's niece Blanche once described her as \\"strongly addicted to Society as business.\\" References ;Notes ;Sources External links * Category:1854 births Category:1926 deaths Category:American people of Irish descent Category:American socialites Category:Gilded Age Category:Oelrichs family ","title":"Theresa Fair Oelrichs"},{"id":"10819651","text":"Athey is a surname.

On 20 April 2007, el- Attar was found guilty of spying for Israel in an Egyptian courtroom, and sentenced to fifteen years in prison, with no right of appeal.. He was accused of being paid to spy on Egyptians and Arabs in Turkey and Canada. He allegedly recruited several new agents in Canada, targeting gays and those he knew were in financial trouble within Arab communities. He used his position at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce to identify potential recruits. He was jointly charged with three Israelis, who were convicted in absentia and also sentenced to fifteen years in prison. An interrogation transcript alleges that el-Attar told interrogators that he was a homosexual who married and divorced at least four times after arriving in Canada in 2002, and that he was paid $500 for each espionage report he filed on the Toronto Arab community. According to the transcript, el-Attar went to the Israeli embassy in Ankara and asked for a job, and the Israelis advised him to convert to Christianity and relocated him to Canada. introduced him to Catholic leaders in Turkey who schooled him in the religion. The transcript says that el-Attar cited his conversion to Christianity and the fact that he is gay, in applying to the United Nations for refugee status from Egypt. According to his lawyer, el- Attar was directed to focus his efforts on Arabs whose native states bordered Israel ‚Äî Syrians, Jordanians, Lebanese, Egyptians and Palestinians. The lawyer further said el-Attar flew to Cairo on 1 January, 2007 at the behest of his handlers who had asked him to make amends with his family. From there, he was supposed to travel to Israel. When arrested, el-Attar was in shock about the amount of information the Egyptian authorities had compiled and felt it was best to confess. Later, el-Attar claimed he confessed only after days of torture. He said he was forced to drink his own urine, was given electric shocks, and that his family in Egypt was threatened. During his trial, most of the evidence came from his confession, which he signed after spending at least three weeks incommunicado, with no consular assistance and no lawyer.

Perales, 402 U.S. 389 (1971), was a case heard by the United States Supreme Court to determine and delineate several questions concerning administrative procedure in Social Security disability cases. Among the questions considered was the propriety of using physicians' written reports generated from medical examinations of a disability claimant, and whether these could constitute \\"substantial evidence\\" supportive of finding nondisability under the Social Security Act..  Issues  1.) Do written reports by physicians who have examined a claimant for disability benefits under the Social Security Act constitute ‚Äúsubstantial evidence‚Äù? 2.) Are such reports allowable to support a finding of non-disability? 3.) Are such reports hearsay under the rules of evidence in administrative law hearings? 4.) Is cross-examination of the authors of such reports allowable under the subpoena rules of administrative law? 5.) Does the failure of the claimant to exercise subpoena power, and call hostile witnesses for cross examination at a hearing constitute a violation of due process requirements? 6.) Are federal administrative law judges allowed to seek opinion evidence, or case advisement from neutral observers whom they hire, without the permission of the claimant? 7.) What is the status of ‚Äústacked hearsay,‚Äù where opinion reports are created based on other opinions about the claimant, but without examining the claimant? 8.) Is the Social Security Act to be interpreted liberally in matters of disability determination? 9.) Are Social Security disability benefits an entitlement subject to the due process protections of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, as delineated in Goldberg v. Kelly? 397 U.S. 254 (1970)  Holdings 1.) Written reports submitted by physicians in the treatment and evaluation of patients are admissible, and should be considered substantial evidence in disability hearings under the Social Security Act, even though by their nature, they are ‚Äòhearsay.‚Äù 2.) Hearsay evidence is admissible up to the point of relevancy in such hearings. 3.) Subpoena of witnesses is within the jurisdiction and allowable under the rules of procedure in Social Security disability hearings. 4.) Reliance on ‚Äústacked hearsay‚Äù - where written records are reviewed by others who have not examined the patient, but issue reports based on their review, which then are followed by more generation of reports by individuals who have reviewed the record should be discouraged. 5.) It is within the jurisdiction of administrative law judges to hire outside case consultants or advisors to review the issues of the case and offer reports and testimony in the furtherance of resolution. This is a practice that is advisable, in particular in those cases where the medical records and testimony are conflicting, or the medical issues are not clear. 6.) The Social Security Act is to be interpreted liberally in favor of the claimant. 7.) Social Security disability is different from welfare entitlements and does not require the same level of due process protections under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution as the court delineated in Goldberg v. Kelly  Facts and background  In 1966 Pedro Perales, a San Antonio truck driver, then aged 34, height 5' 11\\", weight about 220 pounds, filed a claim for disability insurance benefits under the Social Security Act.Sections 216 (i) (1), 68 Stat. 1080, and 223 (d) (1), 81 Stat. 868, of that Act, 42 U.S.C. 416 (i) (1) and 42 U.S.C. 423 (d) (1) (1964 ed., Supp. V), both provide that the term \\"disability\\" means \\"inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which . . . .\\"Section 205 (g), 42 U.S.C. 405 (g) Judicial review, as noted in the statute relates, \\"The findings of the Secretary as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive . . . .\\" Perales was a truck driver who was injured on the job. Pedro Perales had claimed he had received a back injury by lifting an object at work. Some of his doctors were unable to find an objective neurological explanation for his continuing pain. His doctors' medical reports were submitted to the state Division of Disability Determination, which ordered a consultative examination, which was unfavorable to him.See 402 U.S. at 392 At an agency hearing, the division had called an independent \\"medical advisor\\", Dr. Leavitt to assess the medical reports from Mr. Perales' doctors. Dr. Leavitt did not examine Perales but stated that the consensus of the medical reports was that Perales had suffered an impairment of only mild severity. The division denied Perales' claim for disability benefits. The issue here is whether physicians' written reports of medical examinations they have made of a disability claimant may constitute \\"substantial evidence\\" supportive of a finding of nondisability, within the 205 (g) standard, when the claimant objects to the admissibility of those reports and when the only live testimony is presented by his side and is contrary to the reports. Perales injured his back and subsequently had lumbar spinal surgery. He was deemed to have had a successful result by his physician and others who reviewed his case. Perales contended the surgery had been unsuccessful, in that he was unable to return to work. He presented an opinion from a physician confirming the belief that he was unemployable. Despite this, the administrative hearing found that he was not eligible for Social Security Disability. Perales did not subpoena the doctors who had written unfavorable reports and cross examine them in the course of his hearing, despite having the opportunity to do so. Later, he claimed this failure, on his part had denied him of a fair hearing, and hence claimed a violation of his constitutional right to due process.  Majority Opinion by Mr. Justice Blackmun  BLACKMUN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C. J., and HARLAN, STEWART, WHITE, and MARSHALL, JJ., joined. DOUGLAS, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which BLACK and BRENNAN, JJ., joined. Part I In his claim Perales asserted that on September 29, 1965, he became disabled as a result of an injury to his back sustained in lifting an object at work. He was seen by a neurosurgeon, Dr. Ralph A. Munslow, who first recommended conservative treatment. Surgery to the lumbar spine was performed, but without relief. The patient was dismissed from the practice of Dr. Munslow on January 25, 1966 with a final diagnosis of \\"Neuritis, lumbar, mild.\\" [402 U.S. 389, 391] Mr. Perales continued to complain, but examining physicians were unable to find any objective neurologic explanations for his complaints. He was advised to return to work.[402 U.S. 389, 392] Perales then filed his claim. As required by 221 of the Act 42 U.S.C. 421 the claim was referred to the state agency for determination. The agency obtained the hospital records and a report from Dr. Morales. The report set forth no physical findings or laboratory studies, but the doctor again gave as his diagnosis: \\"Back sprain - lumbo-sacral spine,\\" this time \\"moderately severe,\\" with \\"Ruptured disk not ruled out.\\" The agency arranged for a medical examination, at no cost to the patient, by Dr. John H. Langston, an orthopedic surgeon. This was done May 25. Dr. Langston's ensuing report to the Division of Disability Determination was devastating from the claimant's standpoint. There was little evidence of any pathology which would render the claimant disabled.[402 U.S. 389, 393] The state agency denied the claim. Perales requested reconsideration. Other physicians were unable to establish a diagnosis consistent with disability. A psychological assessment opined he had a hostile personality [402 U.S. 389, 394] The Social Security Act, signed by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935 has a provision for disability The agency again reviewed the file. The Bureau of Disability Insurance of the Social Security Administration made its independent review. The report and opinion of Dr. Morales, as the claimant's attending physician, were considered, as were those of the other examining physicians. The claim was again denied. Perales requested a hearing before a hearing examiner.[402 U.S. 389, 395] The requested hearing was set for January 12, 1967, in San Antonio. Written notice thereof was given to the claimant with a copy to his attorney. The notice contained a definition of disability, advised the claimant that he should bring all medical and other evidence not already presented, afforded him an opportunity to examine all documentary evidence on file prior to the hearing, and told him that he might bring his own physician or other witnesses and be represented at the hearing by a lawyer. Two hearings were held on January 12 and March 31, 1967. The claimant appeared at the first hearing with his attorney and with Dr. Morales. The attorney formally objected to the introduction of the several unfriendly reports of examining physicians. Counsel asserted, among other things, the reports were hearsay. At the two hearings oral testimony was submitted by claimant Perales, by Dr. Morales, by a former fellow [402 U.S. 389, 396] employee of the claimant, by a vocational expert, and by Dr. Lewis A. Leavitt, a physician board-certified in physical medicine and rehabilitation, and chief of, and professor in, the Department of Physical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. Dr. Leavitt was called by the hearing examiner as an independent \\"medical adviser,\\" that is, as an expert who does not examine the claimant but who hears and reviews the medical evidence and who may offer an opinion. The adviser is paid a fee by the Government. The claimant, through his counsel, objected to any testimony by Dr. Leavitt not based upon examination or upon a hypothetical. Dr. Leavitt testified over this objection and was cross-examined by the claimant's attorney. He stated that the consensus of the various medical reports was that Perales had a mild low-back syndrome of musculo- ligamentous origin.[402 U.S. 389, 397]205 (d) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 405 (d), provides that the Secretary has power to issue subpoenas (subpoena ad testificandum;subpoena duces tecum) requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence and that the Secretary's regulations.authorized by 205 (a), 42 U.S.C. 405 (a), provide that a claimant may request the issuance of subpoenas, 20 CFR 404.926Perales, however, who was represented by counsel, did not request subpoenas for either of the two hearings. The claimant then made a request for review by the Appeals Council and submitted as supplemental evidence a judgment dated June 2, 1967, in Perales' favor against an insurance company for workmen's compensation benefits. The Appeals Council ruled that the decision of the hearing examiner was correct. Upon this adverse ruling the claimant instituted the present action for review pursuant to 205 (g).[402 U.S. 389, 398] The case was remanded for a new hearing before a different examiner. Perales v. Secretary 288 F. Supp. 313 (WD Tex. 1968) On appeal the Fifth Circuit noted the absence of any request by the claimant for subpoenas and held that, having this right and not exercising it, he was not in a position to complain that he had been denied the rights of confrontation and of cross-examination. It held that the hearsay evidence in the case was admissible under the Act; that, specifically, the written reports of the physicians were admissible in the administrative hearing; that Dr. Leavitt's testimony also was admissible; but that all this evidence together did not constitute substantial evidence when it was objected to and when it was contradicted by evidence from the only live witnesses.Cohen v. Perales, 412 F.2d 44 (1969) On rehearing, the Court of Appeals observed that it did not mean by its opinion that uncorroborated hearsay could never be substantial evidence supportive of a hearing examiner's decision adverse to a claimant. It emphasized that its ruling that uncorroborated hearsay could not constitute substantial evidence was applicable only when the claimant had objected and when the hearsay was directly contradicted by the testimony of live medical witnesses and by the claimant in person.Cohen v. Perales, 416 F.2d 1250 (1969) Certiorari was granted in order to review and resolve this important procedural due process issue.397 U.S. 1035 (1970) [402 U.S. 389, 399]  Part II  This is a case in which there is conflicting medical evidence. This is a commonly encountered situation. The trier of fact has the duty to resolve that conflict. We have, on the one hand, an absence of objective findings, an expressed suspicion of only functional complaints, of malingering, and of the patient's unwillingness to do anything about remedying an unprovable situation. We have, on the other hand, the claimant's and his personal physician's earnest pleas that significant and disabling residuals from the mishap of September 1965 are indeed present. The issue revolves, however, around a system which produces a mass of medical evidence in report form. May material of that kind ever be \\"substantial evidence\\" when it stands alone and is opposed by live medical evidence and the client's own contrary personal testimony? The courts below have held that it may not. Part III The case revolved around testimony given by the Chief of Physical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine The Social Security Act has been with us since 1935.49 Stat. 620 The system's administrative structure and procedures, with essential determinations numbering into the millions, are of a size and extent difficult to comprehend. But, as the Government's brief here accurately pronounces, \\"Such a system must be fair - and it must work.\\" Congress has provided that the Secretary \\"shall have full power and authority to make rules and regulations and to establish procedures . . . necessary or appropriate to carry out such provisions, and shall adopt reasonable and proper rules and [402 U.S. 389, 400] regulations to regulate and provide for the nature and extent of the proofs and evidence and the method of taking and furnishing the same in order to establish the right to benefits hereunder.\\" 205 (a), 42 U.S.C. 405 (a) Section 205 (b) directs the Secretary to make findings and decisions; on request to give reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing; and in the course of any hearing to receive evidence. It then provides: \\"Evidence may be received at any hearing before the Secretary even though inadmissible under rules of evidence applicable to court procedure.\\" In carrying out these statutory duties the Secretary has adopted regulations that state, among other things: \\"The hearing examiner shall inquire fully into the matters at issue and shall receive in evidence the testimony of witnesses and any documents which are relevant and material to such matters. . . . The . . . procedure at the hearing generally . . . shall be in the discretion of the hearing examiner and of such nature as to afford the parties a reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing.\\" 20 CFR 404.927 From this it is apparent that (a) the Congress granted the Secretary the power by regulation to establish hearing procedures; (b) strict rules of evidence, applicable in the courtroom, are not to operate at social security hearings so as to bar the admission of evidence otherwise pertinent; and (c) the conduct of the hearing rests generally in the examiner's discretion. There emerges an emphasis upon the informal rather than the formal. This, we think, is as it should be, for this administrative procedure, and these hearings, should be understandable to the layman claimant, should not necessarily be stiff and comfortable only for the trained attorney, and should [402 U.S. 389, 401] be liberal and not strict in tone and operation. This is the obvious intent of Congress so long as the procedures are fundamentally fair. Part IV Next, the court will turn to the statutory standard of \\"substantial evidence\\" prescribed by 205 (g). The Court has considered this very concept in other, yet similar, contexts. The National Labor Relations Act, 10 (e), in its original form, provided that the NLRB's findings of fact \\"if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive.\\" 49 Stat. 454. The Court said this meant \\"supported by substantial evidence\\" and that this was \\"more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\\" Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938) The Court has adhered to that definition in varying statutory situations.See NLRB v. Columbian Enameling & Stamping Co., 306 U.S. 292, 300 (1939)Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 477 -487 (1951)Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm'n, 383 U.S. 607, 619 -620 (1966) Part V  It is acceptable that the propositions advanced by the claimant, some of them long established, that procedural due process is applicable to the adjudicative administrative proceeding involving \\"the differing rules of fair play, which through the years, have become associated with differing types of proceedings,\\" Hannah v. Larche 363 U.S. 420, 442 (1960) that \\"the \`right' to Social Security benefits is in one sense \`earned,'\\" Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 610 (1960) and that the \\"extent to which procedural due process must be afforded the recipient is influenced by the extent to [402 U.S. 389, 402] which he may be \`condemned to suffer grievous loss' . . . . Accordingly . . . \`consideration of what procedures due process may require under any given set of circumstances must begin with a determination of the precise nature of the government function involved as well as of the private interest that has been affected by governmental action.'\\" Goldberg v. Kelly 397 U.S. 254, 262 -263 (1970) The question, then, is as to what procedural due process requires with respect to examining physicians' reports in a social security disability claim hearing. A written report by a licensed physician who has examined the claimant and who sets forth in his report his medical findings in his area of competence may be received as evidence in a disability hearing and, despite its hearsay character and an absence of cross-examination, and despite the presence of opposing direct medical testimony and testimony by the claimant himself, may constitute substantial evidence supportive of a finding by the hearing examiner adverse to the claimant, when the claimant has not exercised his right to subpoena the reporting physician and thereby provide himself with the opportunity for cross-examination of the physician. The following can be concluded: 1\\\\. The identity of the five reporting physicians is significant. Each report presented here was prepared by a practicing physician who had examined the claimant. A majority (Drs. Langston, Bailey, and Mattson) were [402 U.S. 389, 403] called into the case by the state agency. Although each received a fee, that fee is recompense for his time and talent otherwise devoted to private practice or other professional assignment. We cannot, and do not, ascribe bias to the work of these independent physicians, or any interest on their part in the outcome of the administrative proceeding beyond the professional curiosity a dedicated medical man possesses. 2\\\\. The vast workings of the social security administrative system make for reliability and impartiality in the consultant reports. We bear in mind that the agency operates essentially, and is intended so to do, as an adjudicator and not as an advocate or adversary. This is the congressional plan. We do not presume on this record to say that it works unfairly. 3\\\\. One familiar with medical reports and the routine of the medical examination, general or specific, will recognize their elements of detail and of value. The particular reports of the physicians who examined claimant Perales were based on personal consultation and personal examination and rested on accepted medical procedures and tests. The operating neurosurgeon, Dr. Munslow, provided his pre-operative observations and diagnosis, his findings at surgery, his post-operative diagnosis, and his post-operative observations. Dr. Lampert, the neurologist, provided the history related to him by the patient, Perales' complaints, the physical examination and neurologic tests, and his professional impressions and recommendations. Dr. Langston, the orthopedist, did the same post- operatively, and described the orthopedic tests and [402 U.S. 389, 404] neurologic examination he performed, the results and his impressions and prognosis. Dr. Mattson, who did the post-operative electromyography, described the results of that test, and his impressions. And Dr. Bailey, the psychiatrist, related the history, the patient's complaints, and the psychiatric diagnosis that emerged from the typical psychiatric examination. These are routine, standard, and unbiased medical reports by physician specialists concerning a subject whom they had seen. That the reports were adverse to Perales' claim is not in itself bias or an indication of nonprobative character. 4\\\\. The reports present the impressive range of examination to which Perales was subjected. A specialist in neurosurgery, one in neurology, one in psychiatry, one in orthopedics, and one in physical medicine and rehabilitation add up to definitive opinion in five medical specialties, all somewhat related, but different in their emphases. It is fair to say that the claimant received professional examination and opinion on a scale beyond the reach of most persons and that this case reveals a patient and careful endeavor by the state agency and the examiner to ascertain the truth. 5\\\\. So far as we can detect, there is no inconsistency whatsoever in the reports of the five specialists. Yet each result was reached by independent examination in the writer's field of specialized training. 6\\\\. Although the claimant complains of the lack of opportunity to cross-examine the reporting physicians, he did not take advantage of the opportunity afforded him under 20 CFR 404.926 to request subpoenas for the physicians. The five-day period specified by the regulation for the issuance of the subpoenas surely afforded no real obstacle to this, for he was notified that the documentary evidence on file was available for examination before the hearing and, further, a supplemental [402 U.S. 389, 405] hearing could be requested. In fact, in this very case there was a supplemental hearing more than two and a half months after the initial hearings. This inaction on the claimant's part supports the Court of Appeals' view 412 F.2d, at 50-51 that the claimant as a consequence is to be precluded from now complaining that he was denied the rights of confrontation and cross-examination. 7\\\\. Courts have recognized the reliability and probative worth of written medical reports even in formal trials and, while acknowledging their hearsay character, have admitted them as an exception to the hearsay rule. Notable is Judge Parker's well-known ruling in the Warrisk Insurance case of Long v. United States 59 F.2d 602, 603-604 (CA4 1932) which deserves quotation here, but which, because of its length, we do not reproduce. The Second Circuit has made a like ruling in White v. Zutell 263 F.2d 613, 615 (1959) and in so doing, relied on the Business Records Act,28 U.S.C. 1732 8\\\\. Past treatment by reviewing courts of written medical reports in social security disability cases is revealing. Until the decision in this case, the courts of appeals, including the Fifth Circuit, with only an occasional criticism of the medical report practice, uniformly recognized reliability and probative value in such reports. The courts have reviewed administrative determinations, and upheld many adverse ones, where the only supporting evidence has been reports of this kind, buttressed sometimes, but often not, by testimony of a medical adviser such as Dr. Leavitt. In these cases admissibility was [402 U.S. 389, 406] not contested, but the decisions do demonstrate traditional and ready acceptance of the written medical report in social security disability cases. Procedural issues in Social Security disability hearings were clarified in this case. 9\\\\. There is an additional and pragmatic factor which, although not controlling, deserves mention. This is what Chief Judge Brown has described as \\"[t]he sheer magnitude of that administrative burden,\\" and the resulting necessity for written reports without \\"elaboration through the traditional facility of oral testimony.\\" Page v. Celebrezze 311 F.2d 757, 760 (CA5 1963) With over 20,000 disability claim hearings annually, the cost of providing live medical testimony at those hearings, where need has not been demonstrated by a request for a subpoena, over and above the cost of the examinations requested by hearing examiners, would be a substantial drain on the trust fund and on the energy of physicians already in short supply. Part VI 1\\\\. Perales relies heavily on the Court's holding and statements in Goldberg v. Kelly, supra, particularly the comment that due process requires notice \\"and an effective opportunity to defend by confronting any adverse witnesses . . . .\\" 397 U.S., at 267 -268 Kelly, however,[402 U.S. 389, 407] had to do with termination of AFDC benefits without prior notice. It also concerned a situation, the Court said, \\"where credibility and veracity are at issue, as they must be in many termination proceedings.\\" 397 U.S., at 269 The Perales proceeding is not the same. We are not concerned with termination of disability benefits once granted. Neither are we concerned with a change of status without notice. Notice was given to claimant Perales. The physicians' reports were on file and available for inspection by the claimant and his counsel. And the authors of those reports were known and were subject to subpoena and to the very cross-examination that the claimant asserts he has not enjoyed. Further, the specter of questionable credibility and veracity is not present; there is professional disagreement with the medical conclusions, to be sure, but there is no attack here upon the doctors' credibility or veracity. Kelly affords little comfort to the claimant. 2\\\\. Perales also, as the Court of Appeals stated 412 F.2d, at 53, 416 F.2d, at 1251 would describe the medical reports in question as \\"mere uncorroborated hearsay\\" and would relate this to Mr. Chief Justice Hughes' sentence in Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB:305 U.S., at 230 \\"Mere uncorroborated hearsay or rumor does not constitute substantial evidence.\\" Although the reports are hearsay in the technical sense, because their content is not produced live before the hearing examiner, we feel that the claimant and the Court of Appeals read too much into the single sentence from Consolidated Edison. The contrast the Chief Justice was drawing, at the very page cited, was not with material that would be deemed formally inadmissible in judicial proceedings but with material \\"without a basis in evidence having rational probative force.\\" This was not a blanket rejection by the Court of administrative [402 U.S. 389, 408] reliance on hearsay irrespective of reliability and probative value. The opposite was the case. 3\\\\. The claimant, the District Court, and the Court of Appeals also criticize the use of Dr. Leavitt as a medical adviser.288 F. Supp., at 314, 412 F.2d, at 53-54See also Mefford v. Gardner, 383 F.2d 748, 759-761 (CA6 1967) Inasmuch as medical advisers are used in approximately 13% of disability claim hearings, comment as to this practice is indicated. We see nothing \\"reprehensible\\" in the practice, as the claimant would describe it. The trial examiner is a layman; the medical adviser is a board-certified specialist. He is used primarily in complex cases for explanation of medical problems in terms understandable to the layman-examiner. He is a neutral adviser. This particular record discloses that Dr. Leavitt explained the technique and significance of electromyography. He did offer his own opinion on the claimant's condition. That opinion, however, did not differ from the medical reports. Dr. Leavitt did not vouch for the accuracy of the facts assumed in the reports. No one understood otherwise. See Doe v. Department of Transportation.412 F.2d 674, 678-680 (CA8 1969) We see nothing unconstitutional or improper in the medical adviser concept and in the presence of Dr. Leavitt in this administrative hearing. 4\\\\. Finally, the claimant complains of the system of processing disability claims. He suggests, and is joined in this by the briefs of amici, that the Administrative Procedure Act, rather than the Social Security Act, governs the processing of claims and specifically provides for cross-examination.5 U.S.C. 556 (d) (1964 ed., Supp. V) The claimant goes on to assert that in any event the hearing procedure is invalid on due process grounds. He says that the hearing examiner has the responsibility for gathering the evidence and \\"to make the [402 U.S. 389, 409] Government's case as strong as possible\\"; that naturally he leans toward a decision in favor of the evidence he has gathered; that justice must satisfy the appearance of justice, citing Offutt v. United States 348 U.S. 11, 14 (1954) and In re Murchison:349 U.S. 133, 136 (1955) and that an \\"independent hearing examiner such as in the\\" Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act should be provided. We need not decide whether the APA has general application to social security disability claims, for the social security administrative procedure does not vary from that prescribed by the APA. Indeed, the latter is modeled upon the Social Security Act. See Final Report of the Attorney General's Committee on Administrative Procedure, contained in Administrative Procedure in Government Agencies S. Doc. No. 8, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., 157 (1941)see also the remarks of Senator McCarran, chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate, 92 Cong. Rec. 2155The cited 556 (d) provides that any documentary evidence \\"may be received\\" subject to the exclusion of the irrelevant, the immaterial, and the unduly repetitious. It further provides that a \\"party is entitled to present his case or defense by oral or documentary evidence . . . and to conduct such cross- examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts\\" and in \\"determining claims for money or benefits . . . an agency may, when a party will not be prejudiced thereby, adopt procedures for the submission of all or part of the evidence in written form.\\" These provisions conform, and are consistent with, rather than differ from or supersede, the authority given the Secretary by the Social Security Act's 205 (a) and (b) \\"to establish procedures,\\" and \\"to regulate and provide for the nature and extent of the proofs and evidence and the method of taking and furnishing the same in [402 U.S. 389, 410] order to establish the right to benefits,\\" and to receive evidence \\"even though inadmissible under rules of evidence applicable to court procedure.\\" ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄòHearsay, under either Act, is thus admissible up to the point of relevancy.‚Äô‚Äò‚Äô The matter comes down to the question of the procedure's integrity and fundamental fairness. We see nothing that works in derogation of that integrity and of that fairness in the admission of consultants' reports, subject as they are to being material and to the use of the subpoena and consequent cross-examination. This precisely fits the statutorily prescribed \\"cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.\\" That is the standard. It is clear and workable and does not fall short of procedural due process. Neither are we persuaded by the advocate-judge- multiple-hat suggestion. It assumes too much and would bring down too many procedures designed, and working well, for a governmental structure of great and growing complexity. The social security hearing examiner, furthermore, does not act as counsel. He acts as an examiner charged with developing the facts. The 44.2% reversal rate for all federal disability hearings in cases where the state agency does not grant benefits M. Rock, An Evaluation of the SSA Appeals Process, Report No. 7, U.S. Department of HEW, p. 9 (1970) attests to the fairness of the system and refutes the implication of impropriety. We therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings. We intimate no view as to the merits. It is for the District Court now to determine whether the Secretary's findings, in the light of all material proffered and admissible, are supported by \\"substantial evidence\\" within the command of 205 (g). It is so ordered.  Concurring and dissenting opinion  MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concur, dissenting. This claimant for social security disability benefits had a serious back injury. The doctor who examined him testified that he was permanently disabled. His case is defeated, however, by hearsay evidence of doctors and their medical reports about this claimant. Only one doctor who examined him testified at the hearing. Five other doctors who had once examined the claimant did not testify and were not subject to cross-examination. But their reports were admitted in evidence. Still another doctor testified on the hearsay in the documents of the other doctors. All of this hearsay may be received, as the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 556 (d) (1964 ed., Supp. V)) provides that \\"[a]ny oral or documentary evidence may be received.\\" But this hearsay evidence cannot by itself be the basis for an adverse ruling. The same section of the Act states that \\"[a] party is entitled . . . to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.\\" [402 U.S. 389, 412] As a consequence the Court of Appeals said: \\"Our opinion holds, and we reaffirm, that mere uncorroborated hearsay evidence as to the physical condition of a claimant, standing alone and without more, in a social security disability case tried before a hearing examiner, as in our case, is not substantial evidence that will support a decision of the examiner adverse to the claimant, if the claimant objects to the hearsay evidence and if the hearsay evidence is directly contradicted by the testimony of live medical witnesses and by the claimant who [testifies] in person before the examiner, as was done in the case at bar.\\" 416 F.2d 1250, 1251. Social Security is administered from the Wilbur J. Cohen Building in Washington D. C. Cross-examination of doctors in these physical injury cases is essential to a full and fair disclosure of the facts. The conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals that hearsay evidence alone is not \\"substantial\\" enough to sustain a judgment adverse to the claimant is supported not only by the Administrative Procedure Act but also by the Social Security Act itself. Although Congress provided in the Social Security Act that \\"[e]vidence may be received at any hearing before the Secretary even [402 U.S. 389, 413] though inadmissible under rules of evidence applicable to court procedure,\\" see 42 U.S.C. 405 (b) Congress also provided that findings of the Secretary were to be conclusive only \\"if supported by substantial evidence.\\" 42 U.S.C. 405 (g) Uncorroborated hearsay untested by cross-examination does not by itself constitute \\"substantial evidence.\\"See Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 230 (1938) Particularly where, as in this case, a disability claimant appears and testifies as to the nature and extent of his injury and his family doctor testifies in his behalf supporting the fact of his disability, the Secretary should not be able to support an adverse determination on the basis of medical reports from doctors who did not testify or the testimony of an HEW employee who never even examined the claimant as a patient. One doctor whose word cast this claimant into limbo never saw him, never examined him, never took his vital statistics or saw him try to walk or bend or lift weights. He was a \\"medical adviser\\" to HEW. The use of circuit-riding doctors who never see or examine claimants to defeat their claims should be beneath the dignity of a great nation. Three other doctors who were not subject to cross-examination were experts retained and paid by the Government. Some, we are told, who were subject to no cross- examination were employed by the workmen's compensation insurance company to defeat respondent's claim.[402 U.S. 389, 414] Judge Spears who first heard this case said that the way hearing officers parrot \\"almost word for word the conclusions\\" of the \\"medical adviser\\" produced \\"nausea\\" in him. Judge Spears added: \\"[H]earsay evidence in the nature of ex parte statements of doctors on the critical issue of a man's present physical condition is just a violation of the concept with which I am familiar and which bears upon the issue of fundamental fair play in a hearing. \\"Then, when you pyramid hearsay from a so- called medical advisor, who, himself, has never examined the man who claims benefits, then you just compound it - compound a situation that I simply cannot tolerate in my own mind, and I can't see why a hearing examiner wants to abrogate his duty and his responsibility and turn it over to some medical advisor.\\" Review of the evidence is of no value to us. The vice is in the procedure which allows it in without testing it by cross-examination. Those defending a claim look to defense-minded experts for their salvation. Those who press for recognition of a claim look to other experts. The problem of the law is to give advantage to neither, but to let trial by ordeal of cross- examination distill the truth. The use by HEW of its stable of defense doctors without submitting them to cross-examination is the cutting of corners - a practice in which certainly the Government should not indulge. The practice is barred by the rules which Congress has provided; and we should enforce them in the spirit in which they were written. I would affirm this judgment. \\"The right of cross-examination extends, in a proper case, to written evidence submitted pursuant to the last sentence of the subsection as well as to cases in which oral or documentary evidence is received in open hearing. . . . To the extent that cross-examination is necessary to bring out the truth, the party should have it. . . .\\" The House Judiciary Committee expressed a like view. \\"The provision on its face does not confer a right of so-called \`unlimited' cross-examination. Presiding officers will have to make the necessary initial determination whether the cross-examination is pressed to unreasonable lengths by a party or whether it is required for the \`full and true disclosure of the facts' stated in the provision. Nor is it the intention to eliminate the authority of agencies to confer sound discretion upon presiding officers in the matter of its extent. The test is - as the section states - whether it is required [402 U.S. 389, 412] \`for a full and true disclosure of the facts.'. . . The right of cross-examination extends, in a proper case, to written evidence submitted pursuant to the last sentence of the section as well as to cases in which oral or documentary evidence is received in open hearing. . . . To the extent that cross-examination is necessary to bring out the truth, the party must have it. . . .\\" H. R. Rep. No. 1980, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 37 While the Administrative Procedure Act allows statutory exceptions of procedures different from those in the Act 5 U.S.C. 556 (1964 ed., Supp. V) there is no explicit ban in the Social Security Act 42 U.S.C. 405 against the right of cross-examination. And the Regulations of the Secretary provide that there must be \\"a reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing.\\" 20 CFR 404.927. [402 U.S. 389, 415]412 F.2d 44 and 416 F.2d 1250 Reversed and remanded. Discussion The Supreme Court held that Dr. Leavitt's interpretation of the medical data was acceptable evidence in an agency hearing, even if it would have been inadmissible under rules of evidence applicable to court procedure. Justice Douglas joined by Justice Black and Justice Brennan dissented saying that although Section 556(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act provided that \\"[a]ny oral or documentary evidence may be received,\\" which could include hearsay evidence, hearsay evidence could not by itself be the basis for an adverse ruling. Written reports by physicians who have examined claimant for disability insurance benefits under Social Security Act constitute \\"substantial evidence\\" supporting a nondisability finding within the standard of 205 (g) of the Act, notwithstanding the reports' hearsay character, the absence of cross- examination (through claimant's failure to exercise his subpoena rights), and the directly opposing testimony by the claimant and his medical witness; and procedure followed under Act does not violate due process requirements. This case distinguishes the termination of welfare benefits already granted Goldberg v. Kelly and the due process requirements in termination from Social Security disability benefits not yet granted. The hearsay nature of medical records does not preclude their use in determining the disability status of a claimant in a social security case. The use of medical or case advisors to clarify complex medical issues is also encouraged. The court was critical of so-called ‚Äústacked hearsay‚Äù - situations where medical reports are generated from review of other medical reports, without examination of the patient. The practice of hiring doctors by HEW and Social Security to render unfavorable opinions toward claimants, without ever examining them, was condemned by the Court. The Social Security statute is to be interpreted liberally.

Original version The song was first recorded by Lemme B. Good (actually Canton, Ohio, R&B; singer Limmie Snell) in March 1965 and written by Rudy Clark. The following month it was recorded with different lyrics by R&B; artists The Olympics, produced by Jerry Ragavoy; this version reached #81 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart. The Young Rascals' version The tale has been told that Rascal Felix Cavaliere heard The Olympics' recording on a New York City radio station and the group added it to their concert repertoire, using the same lyrics and virtually the same arrangement as The Olympics' version. Co-producer Tom Dowd captured this live feel on their 1966 recording, even though the group did not think the performance held together well. \\"Good Lovin'\\" rose to the top of the Billboard Pop Singles chart in the spring of 1966 and represented the Young Rascals' first real hit. \\"Good Lovin'\\" is one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, and was ranked #333 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.

In June 1965, The Who recorded a live version for the radio program Top Gear. Tommy James and the Shondells released a version on their 1966 album Hanky Panky.

Operating as a concessionaire of the National Park Service, the company operated from a summer base in East Glacier Park, Montana, near the company's flagship Glacier Park Hotel; winter headquarters were in St. Paul, Minnesota. Originally known as the Glacier Park Hotel Company, the corporate name was shortened to Glacier Park Company in 1943. During the early years of the Glacier Park Company's operation, its facilities were primarily geared to serve tourists who arrived in Glacier on the Great Northern's passenger trains, which stopped at a station adjacent to Glacier Park Hotel. From there, horse and motorcoach tours connected to the company's other hotels and chalets. The largest of the company's facilities was the Many Glacier Hotel, which opened in 1915. The landmark Prince of Wales Hotel in Waterton was completed in 1927, and in 1930 the company was contracted to operate the privately constructed Lake McDonald Hotel. The hotels were supplemented by a network of smaller lodging complexes called \\"chalets,\\" some accessible only by trail. A total of nine such properties were constructed during the 1910s, four of which survive today in whole or part: the Belton Chalets, Sperry Chalet, Granite Park Chalet and the Two Medicine Store. Two additional locations, Swiftcurrent and Rising Sun, were developed in the 1930s and 1940s to serve Glacier's increasing numbers of automobile travelers. After the 1960 operating season, the company's Glacier and Waterton operations were sold to Don Hummel, a Tucson, Arizona businessman who formed \\"Glacier Park, Inc.\\" to operate the concessions. The Glacier Park Company continued to exist as a real estate subsidiary of the Great Northern, and later the GN's corporate successor Burlington Northern. As of 1990, it was a subsidiary of Burlington Resources. The company is now a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips. References *Djuff, Ray, and Chris Morrison.

Preston's version has been cited as a contender for being \\"the first rock and roll record\\", and Haley's is widely considered the first rockabilly record. Some sources also consider it to be a contender for the title of \\"first rock'n'roll record\\". The song's authorship is credited to Harry Crafton, Wendell \\"Don\\" Keane, and Harry \\"Doc\\" Bagby, who were musicians contracted to the Gotham label in New York, owned by Ivin Ballen (although a live version recorded by Haley in 1969 for Buddah Records was credited to James Bracken). The song was influenced by earlier R&B; recordings such as Wynonie Harris' 1948 R&B; hit \\"Good Rockin' Tonight\\". Ballen passed the song to Jimmy Preston, who had recently had a hit with \\"Hucklebuck Daddy\\". The version by Jimmy Preston and His Prestonians was recorded in Philadelphia in May 1949 and was released on the Gotham label, reaching #6 on the national R&B; chart later that year. Two years later, Bill Haley and the Saddlemen had already achieved some success with their cover of Ike Turner's (and/or Jackie Brenston's) \\"Rocket 88\\", but were looking for another hit. They were persuaded by their producer, Essex Records owner Dave Miller, to cover \\"Rock The Joint\\" - a song which, like \\"Rocket 88\\", had already been successful with R&B; audiences. Haley recorded the song in February or March 1952. The exact location is unknown but it is believed the song was recorded in the band's hometown of Chester, Pennsylvania ). Haley made up verses of his own to appeal to his country music audience, naming a succession of hillbilly dances (such as the Sugarfoot Rag and Virginia Reel) in place of Preston's hucklebuck and jitterbug, and also used different instrumentation on the track, and more back echo. In particular, Haley's version used a prominent percussive slapped bass played by Marshall Lytle and electric guitar by Danny Cedrone, with a lick he duplicated two years later on \\"Rock Around The Clock\\". This version of \\"Rock the Joint\\" sold 75,000 copies. A 2012 article states that \\"The Comets‚Äô beefed-up arrangement of \\"Rock This Joint\\" in 1952 that convinced Haley to move away from his western swing sound towards rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll\\". Although Haley's version did not chart when released on Essex Records in 1952, it was enough of a hit in Chicago to win him a short residency in a jazz club there - although this was cut short after many of his black audiences walked out. Nevertheless, Haley's version of \\"Rock The Joint\\" - three years before \\"Rock Around The Clock\\" - was an important milestone in the development of rockabilly through the coming together of R&B; and country styles. The recording was remade in 1957 by Haley for Decca Records, by which time his band had been renamed Bill Haley & His Comets (it was released by Decca Records the title \\"New Rock the Joint\\" as the original version was still in circulation). He later re-recorded the song for Sonet Records of Sweden in 1968 and numerous live versions were also recorded by him. After his death, members of the Comets who had served with Haley between 1951 and the early 1960s reunited and recorded several more versions of the song, such as for the 1994 Hydra Records album You're Never Too Old to Rock. It was covered and released by Reverend Horton Heat in 1996 on his album It's Martini Time Sources * Jim Dawson, Rock Around the Clock: The Record That Started the Rock Revolution!
