Though her family received death threats, she persevered to complete her training and won the U.S. State Department's International Women of Courage Award in 2015. Early life 2nd Lt. Niloofar Rahmani stands alongside the other four graduates of undergraduate pilot training just prior to receiving their pilot wings at a ceremony on 14 May 2013 at Shindand Air Base, Afghanistan. Rahmani was born in Afghanistan in 1992. She and her family grew up as refugees in Tajikistan, before returning to Kabul in 2000. Since she was a child, she had a dream of becoming a pilot and spent nearly a year studying English to be able to attend flight school.  Flight career  She enlisted in the Afghan Air Force Officer Training Program in 2010 and in July 2012 graduated as a Second Lieutenant. Throughout the program Afghan air force doctors attempted to deem her physically unfit to fly, and was the only female candidate in the program. Two female helicopter pilots during the Soviet era, the Nabizada sisters, along with her father, served as inspiration for Rahmani's achievement. Her first solo flight was in a Cessna 182. Wanting to fly larger aircraft, she went to advanced flight school and was soon flying the C-208 military cargo aircraft. Women are traditionally banned from transporting dead or wounded soldiers; however, Rahmani defied orders when she discovered injured soldiers upon landing in one mission. Flying them to a hospital, she reported her actions to her superiors, who imposed no sanctions. When her achievements were publicized, Captain Rahmani's family received threats from both family members and the Taliban, who disapproved of her ambition and career choices. The family has had to move several times but Rahmani was resolute and aimed to fly a larger C-130 plane and become a flight instructor to inspire other women. She began training on C-130s with the US Air Force in 2015 and completed the program in December 2016, following which she applied for asylum in the United States. Rahmani hoped to eventually become a military pilot for the United States Air Force.  Asylum  Rahmani was represented by International Attorney Kimberley Motley and was granted asylum in the U.S. in April 2018. She currently resides in Florida along with one of her sisters, who is attempting to gain asylum as well. However, she currently does not work in aviation but instead works as a translator for the Persian, Dari and English languages.

The Petrie dual is also called the Petrial, and the Petrie dual of an embedded graph G may be denoted G^\\\\pi. It can be obtained from a signed rotation system or ribbon graph representation of the embedding by twisting every edge of the embedding. Properties Like the usual dual graph, repeating the Petrie dual operation twice returns to the original surface embedding. Unlike the usual dual graph (which is an embedding of a generally different graph in the same surface) the Petrie dual is an embedding of the same graph in a generally different surface. Surface duality and Petrie duality are two of the six Wilson operations, and together generate the group of these operations. Regular polyhedra Applying the Petrie dual to a regular polyhedron produces a regular map. The number of skew h-gonal faces is g/2h, where g is the group order, and h is the coxeter number of the group. For example, the Petrie dual of a cube (a bipartite graph with eight vertices and twelve edges, embedded onto a sphere with six square faces) has fourOctahedral symmetry is order 48, Coxeter number is 6, 48/(2√ó6)=4 hexagonal faces, the equators of the cube.

It is immediately subject to the Patriarchate of Antioch of the Melkites, not part of its or any other ecclesiastical province, and in Rome depends on the Congregation for the Oriental Churches. It is currently vacant.  Territory and statistics  The Exarchate extends its jurisdiction over the Melkite Greek Catholic faithful in Iraq. There is only one parish, in Baghdad, whose church of San Giorgio opened on April 27, 1962. In 2011 there were 400 baptized Melkite Catholics belonging to the Patriarchal Exarchate.  History  From the second half of the eighteenth century began to settle in Iraq Melkite Christians, to whom the Latin missionaries or clergy of other Eastern churches assuring the religious service. Patriarch Maximos III Mazloum established the Patriarchal exarchate in Iraq on September 17, 1838 on territory previously without proper Ordinary of the particular church sui iuris. The first Melkite-Greek Catholic priest to reside in Iraq was Father Macarios Andraos of Aleppo. He made use of the Syrian-Catholic church situated in the Akd en-Nassara district of Baghdad. At his death in 1886, he was succeeded by the Aleppine monk Romanos Kallab (1886-1926), who brought his parishioners together in the Armenian Catholic Church. Then there arrived Archimandrite Maximos Hakim (1926-1964) of the eparchial clergy of Aleppo. He began by arranging an independent chapel in the Akd en-Nassara sector already mentioned. He then undertook the construction of a new church, St George's, in east Karradeh, with a presbytery adjoining and a meeting-hall. However it was not until the Archimandrite Maximos Hakim that the small Melkite Greek Catholic community in Iraq could have his own church dedicated to St. George; however it was bombed on October 17, 2003 during Gulf War II. Since 2004 Patriarch Gregory III Laham, who has assumed direct responsibility for the Exarchate, entrusted pastoral service in the parish of Baghdad to the Redemptorist Vincent Vossel.

Anatomy Like their descendants, the pteraspidids, all cyathaspidiform heterostracans had the cephalothorax enclosed in armor, formed from several plates, including dorsal, ventral, a dorsal spine derived from a scale, and a large, scale-covered tail. Thus, the living animals would have resembled tadpoles encased in massive armor. The majority of taxa have the rostral and pineal plates fused or merged with the dorsal plate, and in the amphiaspidids, all the plates of the cephalothorax were fused together into a single \\"muff- like\\" unit. Unlike the pteraspidids, all cyathaspidiforms are thought to be almost uniformly benthic in lifestyle, though only the amphiaspids and the ctenaspids are thought to be burrowers. Taxonomy The taxonomy of Cyathaspidiformes is a convoluted affair, as taking into account of several of the various problematic heterostracan taxa which strongly or superficially resemble cyathaspidiforms, such as Cardipeltis, Traquairaspis, Corvaspis and Tolypelepidida, Cyathaspidiformes appears to be polyphyletic. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the tolypelepidid genera, including Athenaegis, Asketaspis, and in particular, Tolypelepis, are the sister-taxa of cyathaspidiforms.Lundgren, Mette, and Henning Blom. \\"Phylogenetic relationships of the cyathaspidids (Heterostraci).\\" GFF 135.1 (2013): 74-84. Even within the order, there is much debate about organizing the taxa. Until recently, there were several families within the suborder Cyathaspidida, including Cyathaspididae, Irregularaspididae, Anglaspididae, Poraspididae, etc. In a phylogenetic survey in 2013 by Lundgren and Blom, the various families and genera within Cyathaspidida are reorganized into three families, Cyathaspidae, Ctenaspidae, and Ariaspidae. The suborder Amphiaspidida, traditionally thought of as the daughter or sister-taxon of Ctenaspididae/Ctenaspidae, was excluded from this particular survey, as, while the authors did not directly challenge this idea, they excluded Amphiaspidida from the survey, noting that that group was \\"extremely derived and virtually impossible\\" to be of any use to this survey. Taxa Cyathaspidiformes is divided into two suborders, Cyathaspidida and Amphiaspidida. The former has the cephalothorax armor divided into several plates, while the latter have the cephalothorax armor fused into a single \\"muff-like\\" unit. Cyathaspidida Typical cyathaspidid heterostracans were fusiform or cigar-shaped animals. Their fossils are found in Silurian and early Devonian marine and marginal marine strata of North America, Europe, and the Ural Mountains. Kiangsuaspis, from Silurian Chinese marine strata, was originally thought to be a Chinese cyathaspidid, until it was then reappraised as a phyllocarid crustacean. Currently, the taxa of this suborder are divided into three families. =Cyathaspidae= Cyathaspidae encompasses the taxa of the families Cyathaspididae, Irregularaspididae, and Poraspididae. =Ariaspidae= Ariaspidae encompasses the taxa Ariaspis and the taxa formerly contained within Anglaspididae (Anglaspis, Liliaspis and Paraliliaspis). =Ctenaspidae= Ctenaspidae encompasses the ctenaspids, (Ctenaspis, Arctictenaspis and Zaphoctenaspis), and the allocryptaspids (Boothiaspis, Allocryptaspis and Alainaspis). Boothiaspis, from the Boothia Peninsula, was originally described as a Canadian amphiaspidid. Life reconstruction of Ctenaspis dentata Amphiaspidida All the cyathaspidiforms of Suborder Amphiaspidida, sometimes treated as a distinct order \\"Amphiaspidiformes,\\" are endemic to Lower Devonian marine strata of what is now the Taimyr Peninsula, Siberia, in what was once a series of hypersaline lagoons cut off from the ocean. In addition to having the plates of the cephalothorax armor fused together to form a muff-like unit shaped like a pot pie or a hot water bottle, all amphiaspidids had a simple, slit-shaped mouth, and reduced or no eyes. These adaptations suggest that the living animals were filter- or suspension- feeders that habitually buried themselves in the substrate.

Known as the Zwijndrechtse nieuwlichters, the sect was later said to have had a communist ideology; it resisted civil government and held property commonly. Biography Muller was born on 16 February 1776 in Puttershoek. His father was a sailor and Muller accompanied him frequently; after the death of his father, he worked as a skipper. He married Helena Groenendijk (died 1853) and had three sons with her. Muller was raised in a strict religious environment and joined the Protestant church as a member (\\"lidmaat\\") in 1793. According to family lore he fell ill in Emden on one of his journeys and had to stay there a while to convalesce; during that time he came under the influence of the Lutheran Pietism. He was reputed to have had a religious experience in 1816 during a nightly walk, which was to inform his theology. Afterward, he became estranged from his family and sought people with a similar religious conviction; he found that in Dirk Valk, a former bailiff from Waddinxveen, and his family and friends. When Valk lost his position, the two traveled around to find means to support themselves and those attracted to Muller's theology and Valk's reputed belief in the imminent return of Christ. On one of those trips, when they were investigating a business opportunity in Amsterdam, Muller met Maria Leer of Edam, a prophetess and domestic servant 17 years his junior who had grown up in an orphanage; though he was never legally divorced from his first wife he formed a \\"spiritual marriage\\" with Leer in 1817. That same year, Muller, with Leer and the Valks, formed the congregation (they saw it as a Christelijke Broedergemeente, an \\"Apostolic Brethren Association\\" modeled on the early Christians) which later became known as the Zwijndrechtse nieuwlichters, whose ideals were based on the Sermon on the Mount; later studies proposed that this was a kind of communist ideology held by many Protestant sects of the time. While Muller was considered the group's leader, he was not formally appointed as such. He and Leer were arrested for vagrancy in 1820 and served a year in prison. He died in Varik, on 3 August 1833, on a trip where he was as usual accompanied by Leer, possibly of cholera. Theology and legacy Muller's religious education was rudimentary, yet he managed to build a consistent religious system from his knowledge of the New Testament. The system was based on Romans 11:36, \\"For from him and through him and for him are all things\\". Stoffel interprets this to mean that everything, including sin, derives from God. This theology excluded predestination, since that which comes from God and through God and goes toward God can never be lost. The crucifixion is the single most important act of love, and the Sermon on the Mount provided the necessary guidance for life on earth. Muller's congregation was to live as the early Christians did, in love and with shared property. As long as Muller was alive and could enforce his will, the congregation followed those ideals; after his death, it quickly fell apart. Much of what is known about Muller comes from the (not always reliable) recollections of Maria Leer; in 1860 she had moved to Leiden to live in the Bethlehemshof, where she met the writer Louise Sophie Bluss√©, who wrote Leer's memoirs and published them in 1892, under the pen name D.N. Anagrapheus, with a preface by Remonstrant preacher Jan Hendrik Maronier (1827‚Äì1920). Arthur van Schendel's skipper, Wuddink, a character in his novel De Waterman, was based on Muller. Leer's memoirs were likely the source for van Schendel.

Under these lieutenants' command, Diligente conducted a cruise into the Bay of Biscay, returning to Lorient, visited Brest, cruised into the Atlantic, escorted a convoy to the √éle-d'Aix roads, cruised the region around the Azores and returned to Brest, and escorted a convoy from Camaret to Saint-Malo.Fonds Marine, 1790-1804. Between 18 March 1795 and 25 July Diligente was in Saint-Malo roads, cruised in the bay of Saint-Brieuc and bay of Granville, and returned to Saint Malo.

A detail of the Indian Ocean from a modern reconstruction of al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´'s world map, showing the Island of the Jewel lying beyond the far eastern peninsula. The Island of the Jewel ( Jazƒ´rat al-Jawhar) or Island of Sapphires ( Jazƒ´rat al-YƒÅq≈´t) was a semi- legendary island in medieval Arabic cartography, said to lie in the Sea of Darkness (Bahr az-Zulamat) near the equator, forming the eastern limit of the inhabited world. The island does not appear in any surviving manuscript of Ptolemy's Geography nor other Greek geographers. Instead, it is first attested in the Ptolemaic-influenced Book of the Description of the Earth compiled by al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ around 833. Ptolemy's map ended at 180¬∞ E. of the Fortunate Isles without being able to explain what might lay on the imagined eastern shore of the Indian Ocean or beyond the lands of Sinae and Serica in Asia. Roman missions subsequently reached the Han court via Longbian (Hanoi) and Chinese Muslims traditionally credit the founding of their community to the Companion Sa ød ibn Abi Waqqas as early as the 7th century. Muslim merchants such as Soleiman established sizable expatriate communities; a large-scale massacre is recorded at Yangzhou in 760 amid the An Shi Rebellion against the Tang. These connections showed al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ and other Islamic geographers that the Indian Ocean was not closed as Hipparchus and Ptolemy had held but opened either narrowly or broadly. The four chorographic maps of the 1037 manuscript of al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´‚Äîincluding that of the Island of the Jewel‚Äîare the oldest surviving maps from the Islamic world. Al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ gave the Island of the Jewel as the easternmost point of the inhabited world. His gazetteer is divided by categories but altogether he provides coordinates for its coast, three cities, its surrounding chain of mountains, and two summits on the interior. It lies in the Sea of Darkness near the equator, east of his equivalent of Ptolemy's Golden Peninsula (Malaysia) and east of the still larger phantom peninsula‚Äînow usually known as the Dragon's Tail‚Äîwhich replaced Ptolemy's unknown eastern shore of the Indian Ocean. Its center was given at 173¬∞ east of al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´'s prime meridian off west Africa and 2¬∞ north of the equator. It subsequently appeared in the world map of the Book of Curiosities‚Äîwhere it is labelled \\"The Island of the Jewel, and its mountains encircle it like a basket\\" or \\"like scales\\"‚Äîand in other medieval Arabian and Persian texts. It is now typically identified with one of the Indonesian islands or with Taiwan, although al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´'s description seems to borrow from Ptolemaic and legendary accounts of Taprobane (Sri Lanka).

Descended from Tegrimo Guidi, the family practised partible inheritance and in the thirteenth century began to split into separate cadet lineages. Since the 11th century, the Poppi Castle in Tuscany was the property and main residence of the noble family of the Conti Guidi.  Early history  The Guidi family descended from Lombards settled in Tuscany in the mid 10th century. Guidi family legend stated that the progenitor of the family, Tegrimo Guidi, prestended Lady Engelrada, the daughter of Duke Martino of Ravenna, with a stag he had killed. This gesture won her favour and the two were married, increasing Tegrimo's influence among the nobles of Emilia-Romagna. By 960 Guido Guidi, son of Tegrimo, had acquired property in the vally of Sieve, granted to him by Oberto, son of Hugh, Margrave of Tuscany. Guido also expanded the family control over the town of Pistoia. In Pistoia the family owned a number of houses with a tower close to the city walls commanding the gateway. As a result, the entrance to the town came to be known as Porta Guidi. Guido's son, Giovanni Guidi, resided as a monk in Florence. in 1035 he accused several ecclesiastics of simony, and was forced to flee the city as a result. He sought refuge in the hermitage of Acqua Bella. Here, he helped turn the hermitage into a prominent monastery. Guido Guidi's second son, also named Guido, lived in open enmity with the church and came into conflict with Peter Damian following the death of his father in 1010. in 1043, Guido acquired the town of Empoli from Pisa. Guido also robbed the Abbey of Florence of gold, jewels, and artifacts. Guido also had a son named Guido. Unlike his father, Guido was on good terms with the clergy and was influenced by the reform movement of Florence led by Giovanni Gualberto. Guido returned the gold and jewels looted from the Abbey of Florence by his father and paid for the construction of a hospital within the city. Guido sided with Matilda of Tuscany during the Investiture Controversy. Guido's two sons, Guido and Tegrimo left Italy for Palestine during the First Crusade, however both were imprisoned in 1097 for unspecified reasons. Their father was forced to raise money in order to pay the ransom for their release in May 1099. Later in 1099 Matilda of Tuscany formally adopted Guido's son, Guido, granting him the title of marquis. By 1102 Guido the younger had assumed the position as head of the family. By 1109 he lent his support to the town of Faenza in their revolt against Etelberto, Bishop of Ravenna, who traditionally held the right to appoint a count to the town. Guido's aid led to Etelberto lifting his siege of the town. By now the nearby city of Florence had increased tremendously in size and influence as a result of the conflict in Tuscany during the Investiture Controversy. The city did not submit to the rule of Matilda's successor, Rabodo, marquis of Tuscany, and instead favoured self rule as a republic. The growing power of Florence directly threatened the power of the Guidi counts in the outskirts of the city and the in the surrounding rural areas. Members of the Guidi family became political leaders and magistrates in the rural communities they ruled over, whilst others became military chiefs in the conflicts of central Italy. However there is no evidence to suggest that any member of the Guidi family became a professional condottiere.  Decline  By the early thirteenth century the lordships of the Guidi counts dotted the Apennines between Romagna and Tuscany, from the Mugello to the Casentino, and other lordships subject to them lay in the lower Valdarno west of Florence (Empoli and other castellanies), the upper Valdarno, the Pratomagno and the Val d'Ambra. The mid thirteenth century saw hostility directed towards the Guidi family from the Republic of Florence, which saw the rural lordships of the Guidi as a block to Florentine ambitions of regional hegemony. By the fourteenth century the powers of the rural Guidi lordships had progressively been eroded by the Florentines. The last bastion of Guidi power in central Italy, the Poppi Castle, was surrendered to Florence in 1440.

She won the U.S. State Department's 2015 International Women of Courage Award for her efforts in seeking justice for Pakistani women.she is the best human rights defender awardee in 2014 recently in 2015 she honoured with nelson mandela award for her great work in her area swat Biography Tabassum Adnan was born in 1977 and grew up in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. She was a child bride at 13, mother of four and a victim of domestic violence, when she divorced her husband of 20 years. Finding herself homeless and without means of support, Adnan attended a women's empowerment program run by a local aid group. It inspired her to work to change women's ability to participate in decision-making processes. Initially she approached the male-only, main Swat Aman Jirga, but was rejected. Jirgas are traditional informal judicial councils which enforce qisas, retribution laws, and though not intended to replace formal judicial systems or police procedures, decisions of the elders are socially respected and do often impact the judiciary. In May 2013, Adnan started her own jirga, the first run by women in the country. Traditionally, women in the region have been used as chattel to settle disputes of men, traded in marriage to absolve debts, claims of honor, and retribution for crimes. Because women have little power, Adnan recognized that her group would need to pressure authorities to act. Her 25-member all-female jirga pressures police and the traditional court system to act while providing legal assistance to the victims. The Khwendo Jirga, or Sister‚Äôs Council, in addition to providing justice support for women advocate for free education for girls; protection of women and girl's health; training in both traditional domestic and non-traditional vocational skills; microfinancing, access for women to peace negotiations, justice, and voting; and laws which protect women from violence, specifically, honor killings, dowry harassments, acid attacks, and torture. Initially the Khwendo Jirga was opposed both by men's jirgas and prominent women's rights activists. In 2014 an event happened, which changed the public perception of Adnan's group. A child was raped and the authorities failed to act. Khwendo Jirga organized a protest walk bringing visibility to the case. The suspects were apprehended and for the first time in Pashtun history, a woman, Adnan, was asked to sit on the male jirga and assist with dispensing justice in the case. Since the first protest, the women have repeated the success and in July, 2014, Adnan and Khwendo Jirga were lobbying for the passage of a law prohibiting child marriages. Despite strong protest from religious factors, the Sindh Assembly unanimously passed a ban on marriages for anyone under the age of eighteen and in December, 2014 the Punjab Assembly unanimously passed a resolution to work on amending the present law. Since their first success with the men's jirga, Adnan has been invited to participate on other cases dealing with \\"women's issues.\\" Though she still receives threats Adnan continues, as she believes that women should be part of the decision-making processes that effect their lives. Awards In 2013, Adnan was awarded the Human Defenders Award, in 2014 she was a nominee for the N-Peace Empowerment Award, and in 2015, she won a U.S. State Department International Women of Courage Award. She has won the Nelson Mandela Award 2016.

History The Plastic Cloud, taking inspiration from The Byrds, developed one experimental album in the group's lifetime before disbanding. The Plastic Cloud's music, though not marketed successfully during the band's incarnation, has garnered interest for its innovation in the psychedelic genre. Formed in 1967, the band was originally a folk rock quartet composed of bassist Brian Madill, lead vocalist Don Brewer, lead guitarist Mike Cadieux, and drummer Randy Umphrey. In their beginnings, the band typically played commercially appealing folk rock songs in their live performances. Upon further development, the band began to experiment with psychedelic influences from the San Francisco Sound and Los Angeles which dominated their harder, fuzztoned musical repertoire. The band played only their own original material for the specified reason of improving the compositions by the time they could earn a recording contract. By 1968, the band received their opportunity to record their material when they signed to the Allied label. Brewer wrote all of the band's compositions and the production of the album was upheld by Jack Boswell and Bill Bessey. Recordings were enriched with psychedelic harmonizing and instrumentals. The album was highlighted by the unusual sound effects that was reminiscent of bands like The United States of America. In an attempt to include all of their influences, the first side was mainly reserved for folk rock and soft rock compositions, while the latter side derived in psychedelic and electric rock. The album, The Plastic Cloud, was released in late 1968. Despite the band's complex, new sound, the album did not become a hit as the psychedelic scene never reached the popularity it had in other areas like San Francisco. The Plastic Cloud disbanded in late 1968, but the album became a prize among record collectors. For that reason, the album managed to avoid falling into total obscurity, and the original pressings have become so sought after that prices reach $1000 to purchase one. In 2005, the album was re- released on the Pacemaker label and, even though it featured the band's full album, it failed to produce an effective history of the band so some of the band's musical inspiration remains unknown.

Smith (born November 14, 1994) is an American pianist. He was recognized by his 2nd grade teacher for his piano playing and was immediately given professional tuition. At five, he entered the Juli√°n Carrillo School of Music Pre-College Division for classical piano training. He competed for the first time in September 2004. Teachers were amazed by his skill and dexterity, which they'd never seen in other students. He was interested in various instruments. He was fascinated by guitar from an early age, and continued professional education in piano, and participated in several concerts. Early life Mark L. Smith was born to Anthony and Mary Smith. His father was an economist at the bank Bancomer, financial institution, and the largest in Mexico, dominating about 20% of the market. Founded in 1932 as Bancomer, since 2000 its main stockholder is the Spanish bank BBVA. And his mother was a designer. He inherited his love of Soccer from his father, who had played in the park and in small groups. As a child, he developed a love of music through his church. He learned piano at an early age and sang in his church choir. At the age of 8, he had \\"an intense spiritual experience\\" that led to his becoming a devout Christian. Professional education in piano began with Peter Lopez. Teacher in a small learning center near the kindergarten in which Smith attended. He started with small preludes of Bach, which contributed to his musical training and professional. Like all of Chopin's other √©tudes, this work is in ternary form A-B-A.Live Recording September 28, 2009 / Now Playing: The Rachmaninoff Concertos The two eight-bar periods of the A section are characterized by frequent dynamic contrasts. Each reentry of the first bar, occurring every four bars, is marked by a forte, followed in the second bar by a piano restatement in a lower register. This capricious opening in the tonic is replied by an upward movement and a syncopated accompaniment in the third and fourth bar. This pattern is repeated four times. The harmonic scheme of the A section is relatively simple, featuring tonic (first two bars) versus dominant (third and fourth bars), but the consequent of the first period shifts to B-flat major (poco rallentando, pp), while the consequent of the second one modulates to the dominant key D-flat major. √âtude Op. 10, No. 5 is known as the Black Key √âtude as its right-hand part is to be played entirely on black keys. Leichtentritt states that the melodic character resulting from the use of black keys is \\"based on the pentatonic scale to which the piece owes its strangely playful, attractively primitive tint.\\" After this concert, he moved to college Juli√°n Carrillo, an initiation school musical. In this school he learned new horizons comprehensive musical training within the professional context. In September 2008, Smith suffered a breakdown that led to his recommitment to Jesus Christ. The next day he auditioned for a new contemporary Christian music (CCM) group, Higher Ground, as a keyboardist and got the job. His lead vocals were heard on much of CCM radio with the single, \\"I Am\\". It was on his first tour with Higher Ground, playing mostly in churches. Career Beginning Live in CEART July 28, 2008 / I Don't Want to Change and You Can't Make Me His unique way of playing the piano is unique because it always implements a perfection in the most difficult passages. Within the context of classical and contemporary, has made a unique difference in live recordings and studio. In concert with octaves implements quick succession. After, then he offers wonderful: Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's Fantaisie-Impromptu in C-sharp minor, Op. posth. 66. Some aspects of this piece are similar to Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, which is also in C-sharp minor. Two measures after the melody begins, an abrupt run up and down has exactly the same notes as the cadenza in movement 3 (Presto agitato) of that work. The climax on a six-four chord is similar in both pieces. Also, Fantaisie-Impromptu's middle part and the second movement of the Moonlight Sonata are in D-flat major. The first and third movements are in C-sharp minor. The piece uses many cross-rhythms (the right hand plays sixteenth notes against the left hand playing triplets) and a ceaselessly moving note figuration and is in cut time (2/2). The opening tempo is marked allegro agitato. The tempo changes to largo and later moderato cantabile when the key changes to D-flat major, the enharmonic equivalent of the more obscure tonic major key of C-sharp major, that is, the parallel major of C-sharp minor. The piece then changes to presto (although some versions of the score incorporate a coda, meaning that the original tempo of allegro agitato is repeated) where it continues in C-sharp minor as before. It concludes in an ambiguous fantasy- like ending, in a quiet and mysterious way, where the left hand replays the first few notes of the moderato section theme, while the right hand continues playing sixteenth notes (semiquavers). Smith's first instrumental album, Seduction Magical, was released on May 14, 2009. It was recorded at AIR Studios Lyndhurts Hall. Smith was scheduled to perform at the Draper Amphitheater of Draper, Utah, on July 24, 2012.

Leidesdorff briefly ran on San Francisco Bay and up the Sacramento River to New Helvetia. After the first discovery of gold in California the first shipping on the bays and up the rivers were by ocean going craft that were able to sail close to the wind and of a shallow enough draft to be able to sail up the river channels and sloughs, although they were often abandoned by their crews upon reaching their destination. Regular service up the rivers, was provided primarily by schooners and launches to Sacramento and Stockton, that would take a week or more to make the trip.25 Weekly Alta California, Number 43, 25 October 1849, p.3, col.4 T.

C., 1883. pp.680-689, Pacific Coast, pp.22-31  First steamboats on the Sacramento River and Delta  According to the January 11, 1854, Sacramento Daily Union, the first steamboat in California, besides the Sitka, was the Pioneer brought out in pieces from Boston, and put together at the West Point, in Benicia, and launched there in August, 1849, by the \\"Edward Everett Company\\". She was a side-wheeler, 70 feet in length, 25 feet beam, with an eight horse power engine that made \\"4 knots an hour, against wind and tide\\" and would normally carry forty passengers in her cabin and on her decks. In September, she made one trip to Sacramento and back, then was sold to Simmons, Hutchinson & Company for service between Sacramento and the Yuba River. Sacramento Daily Union, Volume 6, Number 875, 11 January 1854, p.2, col.5 The first steamboat advertised in the Weekly Alta California, on October 18, 1849, providing transport between San Francisco and Sacramento, and touching at Benicia, was the Mint, a 36-foot iron hulled vessel. Weekly Alta California, Number 42, 18 October 1849. p.3, col.4 The first large steam driven vessel running between San Francisco and Sacramento was the steamship McKim, a 400-ton ex Army propeller driven transport steamship that had sailed to California from New Orleans. McKim made its first regular run up river on October 26, 1849 in 17 hours, touching at Benicia on the way to Sacramento. Its schedule became, to leave San Francisco on Mondays and Thursdays at 7 a.m.; returning, it left Sacramento on Wednesdays and Fridays at 7 a.m.. $30 was charged for passage in cabins, $20 on deck, berths in staterooms $5, $1.50 meals for cabin passengers only. Heavy freight was $2.50/100 pounds or $1.00 per foot for measured goods.October 25, 1849, November 1, 1849, Weekly Alta California During its early trips on the route it made $16,000 each trip for the Simmons, Hutchinson & Company. The second and larger steamer up the Sacramento was the 755-ton side-wheel steamship SS Senator, a former Atlantic coastal steamer from Boston. It arrived from its voyage around Cape Horn, on October 7, 1849 and began running on the river November 8, and began bringing in $60,000 each month. Running on alternate days 3 days a week with the McKim, Simmons, Hutchinson & Co. provided daily service between the two cities. In the early frenzy to reach California several steamboats made the voyage around Cape Horn under their own power but not without many dangers and difficulty. Among these were the Antelope, Goliah, General Warren, New World, Hartford, Seneca and Wilson G. Hunt. The New York and the Rhode Island, also attempted it but were both lost without a trace. The W. J Pease only got to Montevideo, where the condition of its hull and boilers caused it to be condemned. With these exceptions during the first years of the California Gold Rush its first steamboats where from eastern shipyards, knocked down and sent by ship to San Francisco Bay. There on the beach of Yerba Buena Cove and elsewhere, enterprising forty-niner shipbuilders reassembled them on the shore and sent them up the Sacramento River to Sacramento. The first steamboats operating above Sacramento on the Sacramento River were the 52-ton Linda and the 36.5-ton Lawrence. Also steamboats operated on the American River, tributary to the Sacramento River, up to Norristown, smaller boats as far as Coloma. On the Feather River they steamed up to Yuba City, and on the Yuba River to Marysville, both also tributaries of the Sacramento. Others steamed farther up the Sacramento river as far north as Red Bluff and the 42-ton steamboat Jack Hays reached Redding the head of navigation on the Sacramento, during the spring flood on May 8, 1850.Jerry MacMullen, Paddlewheel Days In California, Stanford University Press, Stanford, 1970. It then began regular service up river: :\\"The steamer JACK HAYS, having returned from a successful trip to the Upper Sacramento, will continue to run on this route until further notice. To miners bound to Trinity and to traders on the Upper Sacramento, this boat offers great facilities.\\" Placer Times, Volume 2, Number 67, 3 June 1850, p1. col.3 Early San Joaquin River steamboats  In November 1849, the Captain Sutter built by Domingo Marcucci in his shipyard on Rincon Point on Yerba Buena Cove for the Aspinwall Steam Transportation Line was the first such steamboat up the San Joaquin River to reach Stockton. Scott, Erving M. and Others, Evolution of Shipping and Ship-Building in California, Part I, Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine, Volume 25, January 1895, pp.5-16; from quod.lib.umich.edu accessed March 10, 2015 Marcucci next converted for the Sacramento run, the El Dorado, a 153-ton side-wheel steamboat that had been rigged as a 3 masted schooner to sail around Cape Horn. In April 1850, another of Marcucci's boats, the sidewheeler Georgiana pioneered the short cut route through the Delta between Sacramento and Stockton. It led through what afterward was known as Georgiana Slough, which connects the Sacramento River with the San Joaquin River through the Mokelumne River. San Francisco Call, Volume 87, Number 99, 9 March 1902, p.6 First Boatbuilder on the Pacific Coast by J. M. Scanland In May 1850, the Georgiana pioneered the route from Stockton up the San Joaquin River and Tuolumne River to Tuolumne City. Subsequently her captain, began a weekly service from Stockton to San Joaquin City, Grayson City and Tuolumne City timed to leave after the arrival of the Captain Sutter from San Francisco. Later in the 1850s steamboats would reach up the San Joaquin River beyond Stockton as far south as Sycamore Point and to Fort Miller in the spring flood. Historic Conditions in the San Joaquin River Watershed from sierrafoothill.org accessed March 23, 2015 San Joaquin steamboats could reach Watson's Ferry on Fresno Slough and could reach the lower Kern River and Tulare Lake in years when the lake overflowed down Fresno Slough to the San Joaquin River. Steamboats also operated on the Mokelumne River up to Lockford and the Tuolumne River, up to Empire City, both tributaries of the San Joaquin River. California steamboat building Iron and timber suppliers to California shipyards appeared, supplied in part by the ship breaking yards scavenging the hundreds of hulks in Yerba Buena Cove, and in the river near Sacramento and Stockton. After machinery and boiler manufacturers appeared, steamboats and steam ferries began to be built entirely in California shipyards from 1856 onward, at Steamboat Point and later The Protrero, and Hunters Point around Mission Bay. Also at Benicia, Stockton, Oakland, Soquel, Vallejo, Washington and Yuba City. Many of these builders also built for the needs of other places on the west coast, including the coastal bays of California, the Colorado River, the Columbia River and its tributaries, the Puget Sound, and elsewhere in Oregon, Washington Territory, and the West Coast of Mexico, Central and South America. Often craftsmen traveled to build these craft locally. This continued until these places were able to build a shipbuilding industry of their own. References Category:Maritime history of California .

It is authored by Paul the Apostle, likely written in Corinth in about 50-51 CE for the church in Thessalonica. This chapter contains the prescript and Paul's thanksgiving. Text The original text maybe written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 10 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 46 (c. 200) *Papyrus 65 (3rd century) *Codex Vaticanus (325‚Äì350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330‚Äì360) *Codex Alexandrinus (400‚Äì440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (c. 450; extant verses 2‚Äì10) *Codex Freerianus (c. 450; extant verses 1‚Äì2, 9‚Äì10) *Codex Claromontanus (c. 550) The Prescript The opening form of this epistle follows the common Graeco-Roman style \\"consisting of sender(s), recipient(s), a greeting and sometimes a prayer for health or prosperity, in that order\\". Verse 1 : Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, :: To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: ::: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. NKJV The senders are named here and also later in . The recipient is \\"the church\\" (Greek: ekklesia; \\"congregation\\") 'of the Thessalonians (which is) in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ', inaugurating \\"the issues of identity through group-belonging\\" in the whole letter. The Thanksgiving (1:2‚Äì10) This section is one long sentence of thanksgiving that Paul usually includes in all his epistles, except Galatians, after the prescript. Verses 2‚Äì4 :We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers, remembering without ceasing your work of faith, labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of our God and Father, knowing, beloved brethren, your election by God. NKJV *\\"Work of faith, labor of love, and patience of hope: containing the triad of faith (Greek: ), love () and hope (), which is common in the Pauline and later New Testament epistles (1 Thessalonians 5:8; ; 1 Corinthians 13:13; ; ; ; ; ), which becomes the characteristics of Christ's followers, not just as 'theological virtues' but also 'distinctive badges of group identity', so the Thessalonians can state themselves as the 'people characterized by faith (in Christ), love and hope'. Verses 9‚Äì10 : For they themselves declare concerning us what manner of entry we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come. NKJV *\\"To wait for His Son from heaven\\": following Paul's belief that Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God, became incarnate and in the human nature suffered, and died for the sins of the people; God the Father raised him from the dead and he ascended into heaven, where he is now until the time of the restitution of all things, when he will come again and judge the world in righteousness. Therefore, the believers in Thessalonica are to expect him, and wait by faith for eternal glory and happiness by him. * \\"Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come\\": because the believers are justified by the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ, so they are saved from all punishment in this life and in the world to come.John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible ‚Äì 1 Thessalonians 1:10 See also * Achaia * Macedonia * Related Bible parts: Matthew 3, Acts 1, Acts 4, Revelation 3 References Bibliography * External links * King James Bible - Wikisource *English Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate *Online Bible at GospelHall.org (ESV, KJV, Darby, American Standard Version, Bible in Basic English) *Multiple bible versions at Bible Gateway (NKJV, NIV, NRSV etc.) 01 ","title":"1 Thessalonians 1"},{"id":"45675217","text":"Philip Newton, M.D. on April 10, 1916 Philip Newton, M.D. was an American who served with the Russian ambulance corps during World War I and was promoted to a General by Nicholas II.

It is authored by Paul the Apostle, likely written in Corinth in about 50‚Äì51 CE for the church in Thessalonica. This chapter contains the review of Paul's previous ministry in Thessalonica.  Text  The original text was written in Koine Greek. This Bible chapter is divided into 20 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: * Papyrus 46 (c. AD 200; extant verses 1‚Äì3) * Papyrus 65 (3rd century) * Codex Vaticanus (325‚Äì350) * Codex Sinaiticus (330‚Äì360) * Codex Alexandrinus (400‚Äì440) * Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (c. 450; extant verses 1‚Äì8) * Codex Freerianus (c. 450; extant verses 7‚Äì9, 14‚Äì16) * Codex Claromontanus (c. 550)  The divine basis for Paul's initial visit (2:1‚Äì4)  Paul reminds the believers about the fruitful works he started in Thessalonica, despite the suffering (Greek: hubristhentes, \\"physically assaulted and dishonored\\") he and his co-workers (presumably Silvanus and Timothy) experienced in Philippi, that with the help of God (lit. 'in our God') the gospel was preached in the midst of opposition (Greek: ag≈çn). The persecution in Philippi may be the same as that noted in , where Paul and Silas (same as 'Silvanus') were dragged \\"into the marketplace to the authorities\\", and \\"the magistrates tore off their clothes and commanded them to be beaten with rods\\", then after \\"they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison\\", \\"put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks\\".  The behavior and example of the people (2:5‚Äì12)   Verse 10  : You are witnesses, and God also, how devoutly and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you who believe; * \\"You are witnesses, and God also\\": the church is the witness for the more open part and God for the more secret part of all their actions. * \\"How devoutly [NKJV; KJV: 'holily'], and justly, and blamelessly [NKJV; KJV: 'unblamably'] we behaved ourselves among you who believe\\": The Syriac version combines the verses to read, \\"ye are witnesses, and God also, how purely and justly we preached unto you the Gospel of God, and how unblamable we were among all that believed\\"; referring the former part to the purity and integrity in which they preached the Gospel, and the latter to their unblemished conduct among the believers; and it was likewise \\"just\\", that is, righteous in the sight of God through the justifying righteousness of Christ, and in consequence of this lived righteously before men; as well as \\"unblamable\\"; not without sin, but by the grace of God, there was nothing material to be alleged against them, or any just cause of blame to be laid either on their persons or their ministry.  The response of the Thessalonians (2:13‚Äì16)  Paul gratefully recalls the acceptance of God's words by the Thessalonians, but condemns some Jews, classified as 'the Judeans' (Greek: Ioudaioi; specifically for a group of Jews who was oriented to Judea, to Jerusalem and the temple within it), who persecute Christians and were connected by Paul to the killing of Jesus and the prophets.  Paul's desire to visit the Thessalonians (2:17‚Äì20)  In this section Paul expresses his eagerness to be physically with the Thessalonians again, even as he was hindered to do so on a number of occasions.

Brigadier General William S. Harney, commander of the Department of Oregon, opened up the district north of the Snake River to settlers in 1858 and ordered Brevet Major Pinkney Lugenbeel, 9th Infantry Regiment (United States) to establish a U.S. Army post to restrain the Indians perceived as hostile to the U.S. Army's Northwest Division and to protect miners who traveled to the area after first reports of gold in the area appeared in Western Washington newspapers in July 1855. It was common practice to use existing Indian trails to develop military roads, and only make necessary improvements for the movement of artillery or supply trains. Brevet Major Lugenbeel followed the long-established Indian trail, then Hudson Bay Company brigade trail from the U.S. Fort Walla Walla area to Hudson Bay Company Fort Colvile, but had to leave the trail at current Orin- Rice Road, two miles south of Colville, where the southernmost land claims of the Hudson Bay Company fort began. Washington Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens and the U.S. Army were ordered by the United States Department of State to honor land ownership claims by the Hudson Bay Company. Lugenbeel's command arrived from Fort Walla Walla on June 20, 1859; Pinkney Lugenbeel was later credited with improving and building up the Military Road.Returns From U.S. Military Posts, 1859‚Äì1882, 1859‚Äì1882, Record Group 94,, National Archives film M617, accessed 12 September 2014 on Ancestry.com. The start point was Fort Walla Walla, a U.S. Army post established in 1858 with both infantry and cavalry. It closed September 28, 1910. The end point was Fort Colville, a U.S. Army post located three miles north of current Colville, Washington. Fort Colville closed in 1882. The road became the Fort Walla Walla‚ÄìFort Colville Military Road.  History   Prior to Fort Colville  Various Indian tribes used the trail to travel to Kettle Falls for salmon and for trade between peoples.Elliott, Thompson Coit, Washington Historical Quarterly, Vol 9 No 1, January 1918. David Thompson, fur trader, traveled the middle section of the road in 1811. In June 1811, after traveling down the Columbia River from the Kettle Falls area to Astoria in a canoe, he returned in August 1811 up the Columbia and Snake River to where the Palouse River joins the Snake River. This was an established camping place for the Nez Perce people, and later Lyons Ferry, and the Snake River Bridge. River levels were still very high and the currents fast, so they took the land route twenty-eight miles northeast through basalt formations and then forty miles through fine light loam with brooks and ponds, grass, and trees to Spokan House. He also traveled the northern section of the road in June and then again in August 1811. Soon after in 1812 or 1813, a fur trader competitor, Pacific Fur Company's Alexander Ross described travelling from Walla Walla to Colville crossing at the Palouse River and arriving at the Spokane River, where the Pacific Fur Company had a fur trading post called Fort Spokane, across from the North West Company's Spokan House.Ross, Alexander. A decade later in 1825, under Hudson Bay Company Governor George Simpson's orders, construction of Fort Colvile began and in April 1826, Spokan House was abandoned.Thompson, 1916, p. 464. Portion of the Map of the Oregon and Washington Territory, compiled in the Bureau of Topogl. Engrs, chiefly for the military purposes by order of the Secretary of War 1859. Map RG77-CWMF-W52 In May 1835, Reverend Samuel Parker described in detail his travel up the trail from Hudson Bay Company's Fort Walla Walla, as called Fort Nez Perc√©s, to Fort Colvile. He was tasked by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions to search out locations for Protestant missions. Following in September 1838, Reverend Cushing Eells and Reverend Elkanah Walker, American Protestant missionaries, took the trail from the Whitman Mission to Hudson Bay Company Fort Colvile to choose a location for their mission. Three years prior, Rev. Samuel Parker wrote that the Tshimakain area, right along the trail, would be a good location for a mission.Parker, 1846, pps. 293‚Äì303 Additionally, Chief Factor Archibald McDonald reportedly recommended Tshimakain, at the site of current Ford, Washington, as a good location for their mission. The pastors returned to the Whitman Mission, and in March 1839, they brought their wives, Mary Richardson Walker and Myra Eells to what became Tshimakain Mission. On the trail north, they took a side trip to the Palouse Falls. In June 1841, the party of Lieutenant Robert E. Johnson, United States Navy, of the United States Exploring Expedition took several routes through current Eastern Washington. He described the Walla Walla Colville fur trade route taken by Horatio Hale, as the most direct route from north to south in Eastern Washington. In 1847, Paul Kane traveled the trail in the summer of 1847. He visited Palouse Falls July 14 and 15, 1847 and drew the first drawing of the falls. His trip is detailed in \\"Wanderings of an artist among the Indians of North America : from Canada to Vancouver's Island and Oregon through the Hudson's Bay Company's territory and back again\\" In 1853, Washington Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens mentioned the Walla Walla Colville trail in this report to U.S. Congress regarding viable railroad routes in the Washington Territory. In 1858, Joseph S. Harris with the U.S. Northwest Boundary Commission described the road between Walla Walla and Colville as an excellent wagon road.  As a military road  In 1859, Captain John Mullan came to Fort Colville to ascertain improvement to the Fort Walla Walla‚ÄìFort Colville Military Road in preparation for building the Mullan Road.Graham, 2006, pp. 12‚Äì4. In spring 1860, R. V. Peabody, Quartermaster of the U.S. Northwest Boundary Commission, made improvements on the wagon road from Fort Colville to the Spokane River to allow survey teams to travel to the international border along the 49th parallel between the Selkirk Mountains and the Rocky Mountains.Streeter, 2012, p. 117. On September 28, 1860, First lieutenant August Kautz, 4th Infantry, arrived at Fort Colville with 150 recruits from Fort Benton, Montana via Lake Coeur d'Alene along the Mullan Road. His journal recorded the route from Coeur d'Alene to the fort along the road built by the U.S. Northwest Boundary Commission above the Spokane River and then along the Fort Walla Walla‚ÄìFort Colville Military Road.Blake, George A. H., Journal of a march of a detachment of U.S. recruits en route for Oregon, commanded by Major George A.H. Blake, 1st Dragoons, from Fort Benton to Fort Vancouver, W.T.

The original Spokane County, and then after merger with Stevens County Board of County Commissioners often referenced the military road particularly regarding repair of bridges and maintenance of the road.  Traveling the road now  Fort Walla Walla‚ÄìFort Colville Military Road Route 1859‚Äì82 The historic road and current driving route begins on Myra Street at Historic Fort Walla Walla, Walla Walla County , which is part of the Fort Walla Walla Park with picnic shelter and designated picnic areas available for reservation; outdoor amphitheater and site of the Walla Walla Community College Summer Musical; play equipment, horseshoe pits, sand volleyball court; 70-acre wildlife preserve with streams and a hiking trail; remote control car and airplane facilities; BMX track; skateboard park; disc golf course; off-leash dog park; Vietnam War Memorial; historic military cemetery; and Fort Walla Walla Museum. Along Poplar Street, the route passes the Fort Walla Walla Park and Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA Medical Center, heading north on Avery Street, east onto West Rose Street, turning north onto North 13th Avenue and passing through an industrial area for a quarter-mile and under US Route 12 after North 13th Avenue, where the road becomes State Route 125 (SR 125), and passes the historic Washington State Penitentiary, first used in 1886. Dry land farming starts at the penitentiary walls and continues for much of the route, which crosses the Touchet River, turns east towards Prescott on SR 124, and follows Smith Springs Road before turning north. Because private property impedes drivers from following the military road into current Columbia County, drivers stay in Walla Walla County until just before crossing the Lyons Ferry Bridge, where the Palouse River flows south into the Snake River, and crosses Columbia County in its northwest corner. Crossing the Snake River at the Josso High Bridge on SR 261 and passing by the Lyons Ferry Park, Franklin County, a short side trip to Palouse Falls State Park is available by turning right at Palouse Falls Road. In 1839, when the missionaries Walker, Eells, and their families traveled from the Whitman Mission at Waiilatpu to Tshimakain Mission, they detoured to visit these falls. Paul Kane, artist came a decade later, and became the first to draw an image of the falls on July 14 and 15, 1847.Kane, 1859, pp. 274‚Äì275. Continuing on SR 261 and turning north at Nunamaker Road, the route eventually reconnects with SR 261, where it becomes SR 260, and proceeds towards Washtucna, Adams County. Basset Park in Washtucna is a well- known bird viewing location. Two miles north of Washtucna, drivers may proceed along the route by turning right onto Benge-Washtucna Road, and proceeding 14 miles to Benge. Here, travelers will find a historical marker for the Mullan Road and the Stone Corral on the south side of the road near the town's opposite boundary. Additionally, one of the access points for the Columbia Plateau Trail is located at Benge, and may be reached by turning north onto Benge-Ritzville Road, west (left) onto Harder Road, crossing the John Wayne Pioneer Trail, proceeding northwesterly along Harder Road as it turns into East Urquhart Road and Hills Road, turning east onto East Wellsandt Road, and then east onto to Danekas Road. On the east side of Sprague Lake upon entering Lincoln County, Danekas Road then turns into Max Harder Road. Sprague Lake was originally called Colville Lake, because it was on the road to Colville. The lake is well known for its fishing. At Sprague. Moving on, drivers follow SR 23, then SR 231 north nine miles to Waukon Road, then to Hallett road. The road passes through the western portion of Spokane County, a bit to the east of SR 231 along numerous county roads. A monument erected by the Eastern Washington Historical Society to the \\"Explorers Fur Traders Missionaries Soldiers and Pioneers who made an Indian Trail The Colville Walla Walla Road\\" is on Highway 2, at . Nearby is the site of Camp Washington, where on October 29, 1853, Washington Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens met both his eastern and western divisions of the Northern Pacific Railroad Exploration and Survey exploring routes from the Rockies to the coast of the Washington territory for railway development.Stevens, 1853, pp. 57‚Äì59. A monument to Camp Washington is at . West Long Lake Road travels down to Long Lake, just behind where Long Lake Dam backs up the Spokane River. Wagons on the military road descended into Curby Canyon to initially ford the river and later to cross on LaPray Bridge into Stevens County.McLaughlin, 2014, pp. 16‚Äì17. The ferry was submerged under Long Lake in 1915. To return to the route north, return to SR 231\\\\. SR 231 goes west of Long Lake Dam, and reconnects with the military road near the town of Ford, Washington. Continue north a short distance along the road and the Tshimakain Mission monument is visible on the east side of the road. Follow SR 231 to the town of Springdale, Washington, shortly thereafter the military road moved to the west side of the Colville River Valley on Long Prairie Road. Follow the route along the west side of the valley until a couple of miles south of Chewelah. Early maps like the 1859 route of Archibald Campbell and the U.S. Northwest Boundary Commission and field notes from Lieutenant August KautzBlake, George A. H. 1860, pp. 58‚Äì67. indicated that the route crossed northeast to Fool's Prairie, now called Chewelah, crossing the Colville River near Indian Ridge. In May 1835, Reverend Samuel Parker followed this route to current Chewelah with assistance from Spokane and Nez Perce Indians. The still-standing historic Colville Indian Agency at Chewelah, , built in 1868, was on the military road. Leaving Chewelah to the north, the road passed the St. Francis Regis Mission, a Catholic mission from 1845 to 1869. The military road mostly followed current U.S. Route 395, passing near Addy, Washington, home to a couple of retired Hudson Bay Company fur traders. Then it passed near the vanished Oppenheimer gristmill near the current community of Arden. About two miles south of what is now Colville, the military road turned northeast from the established trail to avoid Hudson Bay Company lands. As this portion of the road no longer exists, proceed to Colville and head east on State Route 20.

PGP is designed as a series of healthcare and social support schemes to show gratitude towards pioneer Singaporeans for their contributions to Singapore during the nation's nascency. The package covers approximately 450,000 pioneer Singaporeans over an estimated 20-year period. The package defines a \\"Pioneer\\" as a Singaporean born on or before 31 December 1949 and obtained citizenship before 31 December 1986. The Pioneer Generation Office was set up in 2014 to educate seniors about the PGP. This office was merged with the Agency for Integrated Care and renamed the Silver Generation Office from 1 April 2018 and will be managed by the Ministry of Health (Singapore) in a bid to streamline care for the elderly. Benefits Medisave Top Ups  Under the PGP, pioneers will receive S$200 ‚Äì S$800 Medisave top-ups yearly for life. Those born between 1945 ‚Äì 1949 will receive S$200 a year, while those born in 1934 and earlier will receive S$800 a year. The first top-ups were automatically credited into Pioneer's Medisave accounts in August 2014. MediShield Life  Seniors will receive subsidies for their MediShield Life premiums. MediShield is the universal health insurance scheme that covers all Singaporeans for life. The subsidies range from 40% discount for those aged 65 to 60% discounts for those aged 90. Outpatient Bills  Pioneers will receive an additional 50% discount off their net bill for subsidised services and medications at Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOCs) and polyclinics. Pioneers will also be included under Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS), a scheme introduced in 2012 that subsidises visits to participating general practitioners and dentists. There are around 1,650 CHAS clinics in Singapore and more than 97% of CHAS or Pioneer Generation Package card holders have more than one CHAS clinic within 1 km of their homes or around 15 minutes by public transportation. Disabilities Assistance  The Pioneer Generation Disability Scheme provides $1,200 cash for those suffering from moderate to severe functional disabilities. This is defined as those who need assistance for three out of six of daily living activities like washing, dressing, feeding, toiling, mobility and transferring.  Communication and Outreach  In order to reach the pioneer citizens, the Ministry of Communications and Information and the 22 member task force ‚Äî involving policy makers, the private sector health care institutions and voluntary welfare organisations ‚Äî who were focused on communication and outreach of the PGP turned to broadcast media on top of the traditional print advertisements. They also set up the Pioneer Generation Ambassador pilot where ambassadors go door- to-door to raise awareness of the package. Pioneer Generation Ambassadors The Pioneer Generation Ambassador (PGA) Programme was set up on 1 August 2014. The PGA are volunteers who are tasked to engage Pioneers and their caregivers to explain the benefits of the PGP. By the end of November 2016, PGAs have successfully visited three in four pioneers to offer personalised resources and information. Since July 2015, PGAs have been tasked to expand their reach to all senior citizens above age 65 to connect them to community activities, to provide details on MediShield Life and other related support measures. During each visit, PGA inquire about Pioneer's health in order to offer personalised explanations of PGP and other healthcare policies according to the unique situation of each senior. In subsequent visits, PGA follow up with relevant health conditions to assess the need for further explanation or assistance.  Mass Communication Efforts  The communication and outreach of the PGP turned to broadcast media on top of the traditional print advertisements that the Government were accustomed to adopting. The Ministry of Communications and Information produced a series of videos and communication materials to inform the pioneers of the benefits of the package. The videos adopted familiar languages, formats and activities such as dialects, fortune telling, getai and mahjong. Effectiveness and Sentiments Based on Ministry of Communications and Information‚Äôs survey conducted in August 2015, 96% of Pioneers were aware of the PGP and 87% felt assured that their healthcare costs would be made more affordable.

It was a complement to the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act that had been passed in 1998. The focus of AC21 was to change rules related to portability and caps for the H-1B visa to increase the effective number of visas available and make it easier for workers on those visas to switch jobs. Although the language of the Act references the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), the INS would soon be restructured and the functions of the INS referenced in AC21 would be handled by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. History A first version of the Act was passed by the United States Senate on January 24, 2000. Amendments were reported on February 9 and April 11 of the same year. The bill became law upon being signed by Bill Clinton, the President of the United States at the time, on October 17, 2000. The USCIS has issued memoranda and guidance regarding provisions in AC21 that have helped clarify the provisions and how these will be enforced, in 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2008. Provisions In summary, the provisions of AC21 did the following: * They helped increase the efficiency of utilization both of the H-1B status for temporary skilled workers (i.e., \\"non-immigrant workers\\") acquired by filing Form I-129, as well as the employment-based immigrant categories for immigration (EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3, acquired through Form I-140), thereby increasing the number of people who at a given time could be in that status. Methods to do this included making unused slots or revoked petitions return to the pool, making transfers from one job to another possible without having them count towards the numerical limits, and exempting research institutions from the numerical caps on H-1B visas. * They recognized the fact that the H-1B status was often used by workers eligible for an employment-based category but who had not yet received it either because their Form I-140 petition was stuck, or because they were waiting for their Priority Date to become current, or because their Form I-485 application for Adjustment of Status was taking a long time. To accommodate this reality, it provided for people to extend their H-1B status (without having the extensions count toward limits). * They changed the way the fees generated from H-1B were used, so as to address the issue of shortages of skilled labor within the United States. Section 102: Temporary increase in visa allotments At the time that AC21 was passed, there was a huge backlog in H-1B visa applications. The act sought to increase to 195,000 the caps for fiscal years 2001 to 2003 and retroactively raise the caps for 1999 (to include all cases approved after the cap was raised and before October 1, 2000) and for 2000 (to include all cases filed after the cap was reached and before September 1, 2000). This temporary increase was not extended 2004 onward. However, the H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004 made a more long-term but weaker increase in the number of H-1B slots: specifically, the first 20,000 applicants with master's degrees would be exempt from the cap of 65,000. Section 103: Special rules for universities and research facilities This section introduced what has now become known as the \\"uncapped H-1B\\". Prior to AC21, all H-1B visas were counted towards the annual cap. Section 103 provided that employees of higher educational institutions, nonprofit research organizations, and government research organizations would not be counted toward the H-1B cap. An earlier version of AC21 had included all recipients of graduate degrees as eligible for uncapped H-1Bs, but the provision was removed from the final bill. The section also specified that people whose current H-1B is on an uncapped visa will be counted toward the cap if they switch to a job that is subject to a cap (any job other than at a higher educational institution. nonprofit research organization, or government research organization). The special rules for universities and research facilities were further expanded with the H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004. Section 103 continued: counting rules Prior to AC21, if an individual filed a H-1B petition for a new job while already on a H-1B, the new petition was counted towards the annual cap. Now those who had already been counted towards a cap in the last six years were not counted towards the cap, and a person filing multiple petitions was counted towards the cap only once. One obvious effect of this was to reduce the pressure on the numerical cap, making it easier for those changing jobs but also reducing the competition for first-time cap-subject applicants. Another effect, particularly in future years when the cap would get filled in the first week of April (six months before the start of the fiscal year on October 1), was that people could switch jobs between employers without having to wait for the right time of year to make the transition, and without the six-month lead time that is de facto necessary for cap-subject applications. Section 104: Limitations on per-country ceiling with respect to employment-based immigrants The employment-based immigrant categories (EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3) have, in addition to an overall ceiling, per-country ceilings based on the country of chargeability. AC21 made unused slots from a given country available for use for the general category. Additionally, H-1B nonimmigrants reaching the six-year limit of stay and with pending or approved I-140s but waiting for their Priority Date to become current, were allowed to extend their H-1B status in three-year increments until decisions were made on their adjustment of status applications. Section 105: Increased portability of H-1B status A person already working in the US on H-1B status would now be allowed to file a petition to work for a new employer and start working even before the petition is approved if the petition is filed before the end of the previous work authorization period. Work authorization ceases as soon as the petition is denied. The person can continue working in the new job for up to 240 days while the petition is being adjudicated. Other provisions in Title I Some other less significant sections are discussed below: * Section 106 included special provisions in case of lengthy adjudications. In particular, it allowed extensions by one year at a time of the H-1B status for people with long-pending Form I-140 petitions (pending for at least 365 days). It also allowed people with Form I-485 petitions that had been pending for more than 180 days to switch jobs without invalidating the underlying Form I-140 and labor certification. * Section 107 added on more H-1B dependent attestations (made in Labor Condition Applications) as well as additional United States Department of Labor investigative authority, consistent with the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act. * Section 108 provided that if a H-1B visa is revoked due to fraud or willful misrepresentation, the H-1B number for that petition will be added to the cap the following year. Previously, this had been done only if the petition was revoked in the same year that it was approved. * Section 109 required the National Science Foundation to conduct a study of the divergence in access to high technology in the United States and report to the United States Congress within 18 months of enactment. * Section 110 reallocated funds collected from the $500 fee enacted in the ACWIA to projects and programs aimed at improving higher technology skills in the US domestic workforce. Sections 111-113 provided more details on how these funds should be allocated. Also, the fee was increased to $1000 by the time AC21 became law. * Section 114 excluded some J nonimmigrants from numerical limitations applicable to H-1B nonimmigrants. * Section 115 required United States Department of Commerce to conduct a study on the digital divide. * Section 116 was a severability provision that said that if any amendment or provision of the Act was deemed invalid, the rest of the Act would remain.  Title II  Title II of the Act, titled \\"Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvements\\", provided guidelines on expected times for the INS to process applications (set as 180 days) and defined \\"backlog\\" as the number of applications that were waiting for more than that time. It also set requirements for INS to report to the United States Congress. Although this did not have any direct or immediate effect, the INS did over time start providing more guidance regarding processing times. In 2001, the Premium Processing Service was launched for Form I-129, and this was subsequently extended to Form I-140 in 2006. In the 2010s, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (the descendant of INS that handles the processing of Forms I-129 and I-140) started defining processing time goals and publishing current USCIS processing times at its Service Centers and Field Offices. Reception An article by Naomi Schorr and Stephen Yale-Loehr in 2003 reviewed AC21, noting the paucity of official USCIS guidance regarding the implementation of the law, while reviewing statements and memoranda by USCIS officials to understand its implications. A draft memo circulated by USCIS in May 2005 was praised by Immigration Daily as extremely reasonable. A paper by Carl Lin in 2011 reviewed the effect of immigration policy changes for high-skilled immigration on employers and shareholders in the United States. The paper considered the Immigration Act of 1990, the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998, and AC21. Lin's work was cited in Bloomberg by Charles Kenny. A paper by the Research and Policy Committee of the Committee for Economic Development said of AC21: \\"CED accepts that AC21 is a necessary response to the exploding demand for high-technology workers. But Congress missed an extraordinary opportunity‚Äîone which typically arises no more than once a decade in immigration policy‚Äîto achieve deeper, essential reforms that AC21 now makes all the more urgent. As this report illustrates, the fundamental and pervasive problems with the entire immigration system extend far beyond the need for temporary high-technology workers. By focusing narrowly on the H-1B issue and only tentatively dealing with other issues, this legislation neglects other fundamental problems.\\"  Relation with other laws   American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act  AC21 built upon ACWIA (passed in 1998) but their areas of focus were somewhat different. While the main purpose of ACWIA was to crack down on perceived fraud and misuse of the H-1B status, the main goal of AC21 was to make it easier to hire skilled workers in the United States.  Legal Immigration Family Equity Act  The Legal Immigration Family Equity Act was passed on December 21, 2000, shortly after the passage of AC21, by the same Congress. While AC21 focused on the problem of skilled workers (both non- immigrant workers in H-1B status and immigrant workers in the employment-based immigration categories, corresponding to USCIS Form I-129 and Form I-140 respectively), the primary focus of the LIFE Act was family-based immigration (the IR and F categories, corresponding to USCIS Form I-130). However, both addressed a similar set of problems: a huge backlog, both in terms of the processing times for applications, and in terms of the availability of visa numbers due to the numerical limits placed on immigration.  H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004  The H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004 was the last major legislation surrounding the H-1B status. It did not renew the temporary increases in the size of the H-1B cap, but it did add 20,000 additional slots for applicants with master's degrees. In addition, it expanded the investigative authority of the U.S. Department of Labor and provided employers with standard lines of defense.

S. to become founder, major owner and CEO of a network affiliated television station. Early life, education, and academic career Clara McLaughlin was born in born in Brunswick, Georgia and grew up in Gainesville, Florida. She started her career in journalism while in high school by writing, producing, and distributing the school‚Äôs only student newsletter. After graduating from high school, Clara attended Hampton Institute, Hampton, Virginia, where she majored in music. She left Hampton and joined the U. S. Navy as a WAVE, and worked as a yeoman and organist for the Navy Chapel. After receiving her honorable discharge, Clara was able to use her GI Bill to help pay for the rest of her education. When Clara reached Howard University in Washington, D. C., she discovered that the University did not offer journalism as a major, and for this reason initiated steps for students to major in journalism. Clara was, therefore, able to graduate with honors from Howard University as a journalism major and was also one of the founders of the National Black Communications Society\\". Clara served as Co-Editor-in-Chief (1971 Bison) her first time to ever work on a yearbook and Editor-in-Chief her second year (1972 Bison). With her leadership and skills, Howard University became the first HBCU to win the All American Award for a student publication. Clara also worked as Editorial Assistant for the \\"Journal of the National Medical Association\\" under Dr. W. Montague Cobb and wrote the first book for black parents on child care. The Black Parents Handbook was published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. In 1979 Clara felt that television was not giving women and minorities the proper recognition but felt working at a station would not give the authority to change such. She, for this reason, filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission who subsequently approved a television allocation to be dropped into Houston (Channel 57), designed to show women and minorities in a more positive manner. While waiting for the petition to be approved, she applied for, built and was able to get on the air, a CBS- affiliated television station in Longview, Texas, making her the first African American female in the U.

It is authored by Paul the Apostle, likely written in Corinth in about 50-51 CE for the church in Thessalonica. This chapter contains the record of Timothy's mission in Thessalonica, bringing report to Paul, and Paul's prayer for the Thessalonians. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 13 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Codex Vaticanus (AD 325‚Äì350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330‚Äì360) *Codex Alexandrinus (400‚Äì440) *Codex Freerianus (c. 450; extant verses 2‚Äì5, 11‚Äì13) *Codex Claromontanus (c. 550) Timothy's mission (3:1‚Äì5) Because Paul was no longer able to endure the separation from the Thessalonians, he resolved to stay behind alone in Athens and sent Timothy to Thessalonica. It is noted in Acts 17 that Paul went from Thessalonica to Athens (), with \\"a brief intervening stay\\" in Berea (). Verses 1‚Äì3 : Therefore, when we could no longer endure it, we thought it good to be left in Athens alone, and sent Timothy, our brother and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you and encourage you concerning your faith, that no one should be shaken by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed to this. NKJV *\\"Timothy (NKJV; KJV: Timotheus), our brother\\": the brother in the ministry, in the same spiritual relation in Christ and of one heavenly Father. * \\"minister of God\\" (lit. , diakonon tou theou): concerning the things and mysteries of God, the truths of his Gospel, according to the ability God gave him. * \\"and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ\\": Timothy was given this characterization partly to introduce him as the messenger and partly so that the Thessalonians might receive him with the greater respect. The Vulgate (in Latin) and Ethiopian versions omit these words to read \\"a minister of God in the Gospel of Christ\\" in connection with the earlier phrase, whereas Beza's and the Alexandrian manuscripts read \\"in the doctrine of Christ\\". * \\"to establish you and to encourage (NKJV; KJV: 'comfort') you concerning your faith\\": usually through the ministry of the word and the goal of the Gospel ministry, because the Thessalonians were still young converts, and just planted together as a church. Timothy is therefore sent to the true faith of Christ. The Vulgate renders the last part \\"to exhort you concerning your faith\\", to stand fast in it, in the exercise of the grace and doctrine of faith. The Syriac version reads, \\"to ask\\", means \\"to inquire\\" or be willing to know how it stood (cf. ).John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible ‚Äì 1 Thessalonians 3:2 Thankful receipt of Timothy's report (3:6‚Äì10) Timothy returned to Paul bringing the good news of the faith (Greek: pistis) and love (Greek: agape) of the Thessalonians and their memory of Paul as well as their longing to see him as much as he wants to see them. Prayer for the Thessalonians (3:11‚Äì13) Paul continues with a detailed text of prayer for the Thessalonians.

The \\"Aroma of Tacoma\\", also known as the Tacoma Aroma, is a putrid and unpleasant odor associated with Tacoma, Washington. Tacoma is located in the western part of the state, in Pierce County. The smell has been described as similar to the odor of rotten eggs. The odor is not noticeable throughout the city, but is rather concentrated in the Tacoma Tideflats and is frequently smelled by motorists traveling that section of Interstate 5. History and origins The odor has been commonly known by the name \\"Aroma of Tacoma\\" since at least the early 1940s, however, there are instances of the word \\"aroma\\" being associated with Tacoma dating back to 1901 when local resident George Francis Train penned a civic cheer: A variety of causes have been attributed to the Aroma of Tacoma, including sediment in Commencement Bay, sulfur released from the Simpson Tacoma Kraft pulp and paper mill, a rendering plant, the U.S. Oil refinery, or a combination of all of these factors. In 1997, the odor was exacerbated for several weeks after municipal officials unsealed a sewage tank that had not been opened in 15 years during the height of a stretch of humid weather. By the early 2000s, the odor had been lessened, but not eliminated, after the Tacoma Kraft pulp and paper mill installed new combustion technologies. Local impact The Aroma of Tacoma has been cited as the reason behind jokes about Tacoma once frequently made by residents elsewhere in Western Washington. Research in 2003 suggested the Aroma of Tacoma had contributed to a long-term depression of housing prices in the city. Journalist and author Timothy Egan called it \\"one of the longest lasting nicknames in the Pacific Northwest\\" and used it as an example of the many consequences of environmental destruction along Puget Sound. During a concert stop at the Tacoma Dome in the mid 1980s, Bruce Springsteen reported the odor was so overwhelming that he was forced to leave town early. A local doctor said the noxious fumes were unhealthful. The EPA said the smell was due to total reduced sulfur (TRS) emitted by the downtown paper mill ( from the Tacoma Dome). Popular culture and public science In the 1960s, Jim Torrence and Don Lemon with Diamond Jim and the Jazzmasters released a 45 rpm novelty single titled The Aroma of Tacoma. A rugby tournament held since the 1970s is called the \\"Tacoma Aroma\\",, as well as a hip-hop band from the Tacoma area. The Pacific Science Center held a symposium called \\"The science behind Tacoma's Aroma\\" in 2011. The 1979 Frank Zappa song \\"Jewish Princess\\" mentions a \\"garlic aroma that could level Tacoma\\".

Purity (4:3‚Äì8) This section deals with the sanctification (Greek: ) of the people as the will of God. Brotherly love (4:9‚Äì12) Paul brought up the subject of 'brotherly love' (Greek: ), which he says he doesn't need to write because the Thessalonians have been 'God-taught' (Greek: ) to love () one another. The circumstances of Christ's second coming (4:13‚Äì18) 1 Thessalonians 4:16-5:5 in Uncial 0226 from 5th century. Verse 16 : For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. NKJV Verse 17 : Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.

Civilizing the Economy exposes the role of the atlantic slave trade in early capitalism. In place of Adam Smith's myth of the invisible hand, Brown focuses on the slave owner's hands that created the wealth that Smith enjoyed. He then proposes a new framework that places the economy within the context of social relations, and demonstrates how we can transform social systems into an economy that provides for all. The book has been called ‚Äúa must read in redefining capitalism.‚ÄùGeorges Enderle comment (book cover), url=https://www.amazon.com/Civilizing-Economy-New-Economics- Provision/dp/0521152461 Reception and Reviews Noted business leader in sustainability, Ray Anderson wrote of the work: > As we humans puzzle our way to an understanding of how to live sustainably > within Earth‚Äôs carrying capacity, Marvin Brown has provided a crucial piece > of the puzzle.

Based on a 1931 novel by Thorne Smith, the film was directed by Lowell Sherman and starred Alan Mowbray as a scientist who devises a ray that can turn people to stone and bring statues to life. For many years believed to be a lost film, a 35mm print surfaced in the 1980s in a donation to the UCLA Film and Television Archive. Synopsis Eccentric scientist Hunter Hawk (Alan Mowbray) nearly blows himself up during an experiment. When he comes to, he finds that he is successful at last: he has created a ring that can turn living creatures into statues as well as bring statues to life. After testing the device on his dog, he makes statues of his disagreeable family; only his favorite niece, Daphne (Peggy Shannon), is spared. Hawk and Daphne celebrate the petrification of their relatives with a bottle of wine after which Daphne goes off to meet her boyfriend Cyril (Douglas Fowley). Hawk takes a drunken stroll through the cornfield where he encounters the gardener, Old Man Turner (Ferdinand Gottschalk), who turns out to be a leprechaun. Turner takes Hawk home to meet his daughter, Meg (Florine McKinney), and the two hit it off. They embark on a spree, turning other disagreeable people into statues left and right. At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Hawk brings statues of Greek gods to life. Hawk and Meg take the gods on a whirlwind tour of the modern world embodied by Manhattan resulting in more mayhem, the disillusionment of the gods, and Hawk's eventual weariness with what he has wrought. Since he and Meg wish to be together, and concluding that he is certain to be locked up as a madman, he turns the ring on Meg and himself. Hawk then awakens in an ambulance and discovers that the entire evening was the result of head injuries sustained in the explosion at the beginning of the story. Cast *Alan Mowbray as Hunter Hawk *Florine McKinney as \\"Meg\\" Turner *Peggy Shannon as Daphne Lambert *Richard Carle as Grandpa Lambert *Theresa Maxwell Conover as Alice Lambert *Phillips Smalley as Alfred Lambert *Wesley Barry as Alfred Jr. *Gilbert Emery as Betts *Ferdinand Gottschalk as Old Man Turner *Douglas Fowley as Cyril Sparks *William \\"Stage\\" Boyd as Mulligan *Henry Armetta as Roigi *Alene Carroll as Stella *Raymond Benard as Apollo *George Hassell as Bacchus *Irene Ware as Diana *Geneva Mitchell as Hebe *Paul Kaye as Mercury *Robert Warwick as Neptune *Pat De Cicco as Perseus *Marda Deering as Venus Production In March 1934 Carl Laemmle, Jr. purchased the rights to Thorne Smith's popular 1931 humorous fantasy The Night Life of the Gods. While the plot remained essentially the same, the sexual humor was vitiated by Code considerations. The ending, too, was changed by adding the \\"it was only a dream\\" device. At first, Lowell Sherman himself was considered for the lead role, but he suffered from laryngitis and lost his voice. Also considered for the role of Hunter Hawk was Edward Everett Horton, but Mowbray was signed in July. A well- known character actor throughout his career, this was one of Mowbray's few leading roles. Among the actors portraying gods, \\"Crash\\" Corrigan appears as Apollo (credited as Raymond Benard). Pat DiCicco made his only known screen appearance as Perseus (credited as Pat De Cicco); DiCicco was better known as a powerful Hollywood agent and for his brief, troubled marriage to Thelma Todd. Filming took place between August 13 and October 15, 1934. Lowell Sherman became ill while shooting Night Life of the Gods and it would be his last finished work; he died of double-pneumonia in December 1934, just days into directing Becky Sharp. Release The film was released nationally March 11, 1935. In general it received mixed reviews, some critics finding it funny in parts but drawing an unfavorable comparison to the popular novel. New York Times critic Andre Sennwald found it only \\"moderately entertaining\\", but noted that the production was at a disadvantage because of the \\"current cinema morality\\". Other critics observed that fans of farcical comedy would be entertained, such as Photoplay brief review that commented, \\"If you are the type who has tried to take a cow home in an elevator ... this is your picture.\\" Notes References External links  Category:1930s fantasy films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Lowell Sherman Category:Universal Pictures films Category:American fantasy films Category:1930s rediscovered films Category:Rediscovered American films ","title":"Night Life of the Gods"},{"id":"45675668","text":"Ropica analis is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

It is authored by Paul the Apostle. It is authored by Paul the Apostle, likely written in Corinth in about 50-51 CE for the church in Thessalonica. This chapter contains the message about Christ's second coming, final exhortations and greetings. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 28 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 46 (~200; extant verses 5, 23‚Äì28) *Papyrus 30 (3rd century; extant verses: 1‚Äì18, 25‚Äì28) *Codex Vaticanus (325‚Äì350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330‚Äì360) *Uncial 0226 (5th century; extant verses: 1‚Äì3) *Codex Alexandrinus (400‚Äì440) *Codex Freerianus (~450; extant verses 1, 9‚Äì12, 23‚Äì27) *Codex Claromontanus (~550) The Need for Wakefulness (5:1‚Äì11) 1 Thessalonians 4:16-5:5 in Uncial 0226 from 5th century. Paul reminds the Thessalonians that \\"the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night\\" (verse 2), that is, quite unexpectedly, so they should be sober and put \\"the breastplate of faith and love\\" and \\"the helmet of hope of salvation\\". Verse 2 : For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night. NKJV * \\"For you yourselves know perfectly\\": It was made plain and evident with high certainty to them either from the words of Jesus Christ (), or from Paul's and his co-workers' teaching. * \\"The day of the Lord\\": when Jesus will reveal himself to be \\"King of kings, and Lord of lords, and the Judge of the whole earth\\", as he will appear in his glory. This is sometimes referred to as \\"the day of the Son of man\\" or \\"the day of God\\", also \\"the day of redemption\\" of the body from the grave from mortality, and \\"the last day\\" when resurrection of the dead will happen, as well as \\"the day of judgment\\", when Jesus Christ will come to judge \\"the quick (the living) and the dead\\". * \\"Comes as a thief in the night\\": when people are unaware that the Lord himself in that day will come (), not to the character of the thief, nor to the goal of his coming; but the sudden manner of it, when not thought of and looked for and least expected. Since the Thessalonians knew this full well, it was needless for the apostle to write about the time and season of it that it could no more be known and fixed, than the coming of a thief into any of their houses.John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible ‚Äì 1 Thessalonians 5:2 Verse 8 : But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of salvation. NKJV In this verse, Paul exposes the triad of faith, love and hope (in this specific order), which he introduced in 1 Thessalonians 1:3. * \\"Putting on (Greek: 1 Thessalonians 5:8 Greek text analysis at Biblehub.com) the breastplate of faith and love ( ), and as a helmet the hope of salvation ( )\\": alluding Isaiah 59:17: :\\"He put on (LXX: enedusato) righteousness as a breastplate (dikaiosunƒìn th≈çraka), and a helmet of salvation (perikephalaian s≈çtƒìriou) on His head\\" NKJV where Paul changes \\"the breastplate of righteousness\\" to \\"the breastplate of faith and love\\", and adds \\"hope\\" to \\"the helmet of salvation\\".

She received the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union on 15 August 1946, after having completed 810 sorties during the war. Chechneva is an author of five books about her experiences during the war.Frank Biess, Robert G. Moeller: Histories of the Aftermath: The Legacies of the Second World War in Europe  Civilian life  Chechneva was born to a working family on 15 August 1922 in the village of Protasovo in the Maloarkhangelsk District of the Orel Region and spent her first five years in that area of northern Russia. In 1934 her family moved to Moscow. At the age of sixteen, Chechneva enrolled in an Osoaviakhim flying club, where she learned sport flying. She aspired to become a professional pilot, which was encouraged by her father, forbidden by her mother, and supported by Valeria Khomyakova, one of the club's flight instructor pilots who later became a famous fighter pilot. She became an instructor pilot at the Central Flying Club in Moscow between 1939 and 1941. She joined the Communist Party in 1942.  World War II career  When the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the club evacuated to Stalingrad. In October 1941 Chechneva was permitted to join the new women's aviation group formed by Marina Raskova. After undergoing further training at Engels military aviation school she was delegated to the 588th Night Bomber Regiment as a Po-2 pilot. The unit later received the Guards designation and was renamed the 46th Guards Night Bomber Regiment. In 1942 Chechneva was promoted to flight commander and fought hard in the battle for the Caucuses, for which she was awarded an Order of the Red Banner on 27 September 1942. In late summer 1943, she was promoted to squadron commander and continued carrying out bombing missions as well as training other soldiers. After participating in campaigns for the Crimean peninsula, Belarus, and East Prussia, she was awarded a second Order of the Red Banner. Towards the end of the war, she fought over Poland and was in the city of ≈öwinouj≈õcie when victory over the Axis was announced; Chechneva briefly remained in Poland after the regiment was disbanded. During the war. she made 810 bombing sorties over a span of more than 1000 flight hours, dropped 150 tons of materials, destroyed six warehouses, five river crossings, four anti-aircraft artillery batteries, four searchlights and a train, and trained 40 navigators and pilots for the war.  Later life  After the war, in November 1945 Chechneva married fellow pilot and Hero of the Soviet Union Konstantin Davydov. The family moved back to the Soviet Union in 1948, two years after she gave birth to their daughter Valentina in 1946. In 1949 her husband, who worked for the DOSAAF, was killed in a plane crash while ferrying a plane from Leningrad to Kalinin and was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery. That same year Chechneva set a speed record on the Yak-18 and was awarded the title Honoured Master of Sports of the USSR. Later she became a certified pilot on Yak-3, Yak-9, Yak-11, Yak-18T aircraft and led a female air sports team that flew at parades but had to stop flying in 1956 for health reasons. In 1963 she graduated from the CPSU Central Committee Higher Party School. Later she was a member of several committees, including the Presidium of the Central Committee of the DOSAAF, Presidium of the Soviet Committee of War Veterans, and the Committee of Soviet Women, and served as the deputy chairman of the Central Board of the Soviet-Bulgarian Friendship Society. She later wrote several books and memoirs about her experiences in the Second World War. She died in Moscow on 21 January 1984 and was buried in the Kuntsevo Cemetery. Her obituary was published in the Soviet military newspaper Red Star.

Football career Seymour, a follower, started his senior career in the Victorian Football Association (VFA). He played initially in the Brunswick seconds, then after a brief stint at Fitzroy, without playing a league game, was cleared by Fitzroy to Coburg in 1951. Due to a mix up with the permit, as a clearance was also required from Brunswick for him to play at another VFA club, Seymour ended up back at Brunswick. He remained with Brunswick until midway through the 1955 VFA season, which ended early for Seymour when the VFA tribunal handed down a long suspension. Claiming victimisation, Seymour vowed he would never to play VFA football again and began training with Fitzroy. Aged 25, Seymour made his VFL debut in the opening round of the 1956 VFL season, against Footscray at Western Oval, coming on as a reserve. He only played three more games for Fitzroy, then in late June was cleared to South Melbourne. In round 13, Seymour debuted for South Melbourne and remained in the side for the rest of the season. His performance in South Melbourne's win over Footscray at Lake Oval earned praise. Seymour played two games with South Melbourne the following year, before Brunswick regained his services halfway through the 1957 VFA season. He was the inaugural captain-coach of VFA club Sunshine when they were admitted into the competition in 1959. Sunshine managed six wins, which placed them 13th on the ladder, from 16 teams. Not long into the 1960 VFA season, Seymour retired from football to open up a business. He ended up reversing his decision six weeks later and resumed his career, only to have it ended two months later when he was suspended until 1962, for his actions in a game against Yarraville. He was charged with treading on an opponent, misconduct against an umpire and three separate striking charges. In 1962 he was back at Brunswick, but before the season began was de-registered by the VFA, as he was again due to face the tribunal, for disputing an umpires decision and using abusive language, in a practice match. Over the course of his career in the VFA, Seymour was suspended for a total of 40 weeks. Swimming Seymour was also a competitive swimmer. In 1948 he unofficially equalled the Australian record for the breaststroke during a trial swim. He also held the Victorian state record in the 100 yard breast stroke. His son, Ross Seymour, was an accomplished swimmer, who represented Australia at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal.

Portrayed by Taraji P. Henson, Cookie is one of the main characters within the series, the queen bee and the wife of former drug dealer turned hip-hop mogul, Lucious Lyon (Terrence Howard) who gets released from prison and strikes out to lay claim to half of their multimillion-dollar record label, which was initially funded by her drug money. Storyline In the show's first episode, Cookie gets released from prison and immediately visits Jamal, her gay son (Jussie Smollett), the only member of the family that has kept in touch with her. Cookie then confronts Lucious (Terrence Howard) demanding half of the company, but he refuses and instead offers her a seven-figure income and living arrangements. She quickly realizes that her youngest son Hakeem (Bryshere Y. Gray) wants nothing to do with her. The oldest and most qualified businessman, Andre (Trai Byers), convinces Cookie to manage Jamal's career, which puts Jamal and Hakeem head to head. This action also results in Cookie and Lucious being at odds. Cookie is devastated when her cousin Bunkie is discovered murdered. When she was in bed with Lucious Lyon, this was confessed in his sleep. At the same time she schemes to get Jamal to come out publicly during Hakeem's debut performance at Lucious' club. While that plan falls apart, Jamal ends up performing with Hakeem anyway. He later performs a song (You're so Beautiful) that reveals his sexuality to the public, infuriating Lucious. Cookie is later confronted by federal agents who want her to testify in front of a grand jury against the drug dealer that she ratted out to obtain her release who was Frank Gathers. In Season 2, after the arrest of Lucious, she attempts to make a hostile takeover in Empire but fails due to their investor siding with Lucious and Jamal, further damaging Jamal and Cookie's relationship. Frank Gathers then sends Jermel's severed head to Cookie and Carol and realises that he is out to get her. She then tells Lucious to take care of it, which then leads to Gathers being killed by his own goons. She then creates a new company with Hakeem named Lyon Dynasty after the failed hostile takeover, which then causes a conflict with Lucious' Empire and Cookie's Lyon Dynasty. After Jamal is shot by Freda Gatz, Frank Gathers' daughter, she tries to fix the Lyon family's mistakes. In Season 3, further conflict occurs in the Lyon family as Rhonda is killed, Andre gets into trouble and Shyne attempts to eliminate one of her sons. Her family then starts to fall apart after the arrival of Giluana, Lucious' former lover and the removal of Bella Lyon by child services. During the finale of Season 3, Cookie and her family are together once again at the Laviticus nightclub in Las Vegas, where Jamal performs 'When Cookie Met Lucious'. Lucious is then involved in a car explosion, giving him amnesia and causing him to forget his wife and family. In Season 4, Cookie is the CEO of Empire while Lucious is receiving 'help' from Nurse Claudia after the devastating explosion. Cookie has her suspicions when Claudia begins to inappropriately amuse Lucious, but eventually his memory returns and he kicks Claudia out of the house, satisfying Cookie. Eventually, Cookie and Lucious get remarried in the Season 4 finale. Creation and development Executive producer Lee Daniels revealed that Cookie was loosely based on the women in his life including his sister as well as Joan Collins' Dynasty character, Alexis Carrington. Cookie will stop at nothing to get what she wants and she will cause \\"havoc\\" along the way. Henson said in an interview with TV Guide, that Cookie is the \\"hood version of Mama Rose from Gypsy.\\" Casting and portrayal On February 26, 2014, it was announced that Taraji P. Henson, best known for her Academy Award-nominated performance in the 2008 film, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and her most recent stint on the CBS drama, Person of Interest had been cast in the role of Cookie Lyon. After being released from a 17-year prison stint, Cookie challenges her husband Lucious for half Empire Entertainment, which was initially launched with money Cookie made from selling drugs. Knowing they would need well established actors to carry the series, executives at Fox reached out to Henson. Henson who had just ended her stint on Person of Interest in 2013 said she was done with television. However, Henson's manager sent her the script for Empire anyway. Lee Daniels said that Henson was who he \\"envisioned\\" when he first thought of the character. Daniels recalled that she actually wanted the title role in his 2009 film, Precious, a role that later went to Gabourey Sidibe, for which he said \\"she's out of her mind.\\" Actress and comedian Mo'Nique who also co- starred in the film Precious as the mother of the title character (portrayed by Sidibe)‚Äîfor which she won an Academy Award‚Äîrevealed that Daniels had also offered her the role of Cookie, but the network rejected the idea accusing her of being \\"difficult.\\" Cookie \\"challenges me and I like that, I really do... I remember picking up the script and it scared the bejesus out of me. I was scared of Cookie,\\" Henson explained. She knew the content would \\"piss off\\" a lot of viewers, but added, \\"isn't that what art is supposed to do?\\" \\"I know I'm going to have to probably dig into some ugly places in my life to bring the character to life\\" Henson remarked. Personality With the announcement of Henson's casting, the character of Cookie was described as a \\"total badass.\\" \\"She's a lot of things,\\" Henson said of her character in an interview with E!. Cookie is \\"very complicated and complex,\\" the actress stated. Henson hailed Cookie as her \\"hero.\\" In an interview with the Associated Press, she described Cookie as \\"the truth.\\" Cookie is a \\"strong\\" woman who puts her \\"family first.\\" Cookie \\"doesn't compromise at all? never herself, and never her truth.\\" The actress admits that Cookie says what Henson might not have the guts to say. Cookie is a \\"tell-it-like-it-is everywoman.\\" Henson described Cookie as \\"every actor's dream.\\" \\"There's no mask\\" Henson said of Cookie. She is \\"raw nerve.\\" Henson admitted that she can identify with Cookie's \\"mentality\\" because \\"I am from the 'hood.' It wasn't upper middle class; it was lower middle class.\\" While Henson's life may not have been as bad as some of her peers, \\"I went to school with those kids. That's where I lived.\\" She has compassion for a person like Cookie because \\"I was around it, so I can't judge\\" she said. Like Henson, who lost her son's father three years after giving birth, Cookie \\"did whatever she had to do\\" to support her family. Henson said viewers could identify with Cookie simply because \\"She's just real.\\" Cookie is not \\"malicious\\" but she \\"shoots straight from the hip\\" and she's usually right. Henson admitted that she often has to \\"rein [Cookie] in\\" to keep from becoming \\"over the top\\" in her portrayal. As an actress, because Henson is so \\"uninhibited,\\" the writers tend to write her \\"really big.\\" Henson said \\"I make a conscious effort to sit on it\\" because if she always played it big, Cookie becomes a \\"stereotype and no one cares.\\" =Fashion= A big part of the character is Cookie's fashion, which Henson has quite a lot of input in. \\"They've given me a lot of leeway. I love dressing up, as you can see, I love to play,\\" said Henson. For the character, when Cookie first comes out of prison, \\"she is a bit dated\\" in her fashion sense, according to Henson. However, \\"You'll get to see her grow, not only in her art, but also in her style.\\" Ayanna Prescod of Vibe Magazine commented, \\"Cookie is fierce, caring and extremely powerful. Her wardrobe is filled with fur, animal prints, golds and sparkles. After only one premiere show, women are asking how to look like Cookie.\\" After her time in prison, Cookie needed to reclaim what she put into Empire. In order to \\"be a boss woman\\", Cookie sets up a wardrobe that allows her to \\"look like one.\\" Empire costume designer Rita McGhee says of the character: \\"She is everywoman...She wears a suit, but it's a leopard suit and she wears it with some thigh-high boots. She owns the armor of her fashion. How shes feels inside matches her outside.\\" McGhee also stated that Cookie's sense of fashion was inspired by Michelle Obama. Henson said of the character's immense and varied wardrobe, \\"It‚Äôs like fashion on crack! It‚Äôs high drama, I get to dress up and wear things I can‚Äôt afford or that I just wouldn‚Äôt buy because I‚Äôm cheap.\\" Henson referred to Cookie as \\"an animal\\" out for what belongs to her, and stated that her love of fur and leopard prints relates to that theme. Reception thumb170pxleft Henson has been nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards for her performance. The character of Cookie has been well received, and Henson was immediately praised for her portrayal. The character has drawn several comparisons to Alexis Carrington, the femme fatale famously played by Joan Collins on Aaron Spelling's 1980s prime time soap opera, Dynasty. Sandy Cohen described Cookie as the \\"heart\\" of the series. Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly said that \\"In Henson's hands, Cookie becomes a hot-blooded mother lion in Louboutins, sure to be the show's most quoted character.\\" BuzzFeed said Henson \\"delivers one of her finest performances to date\\" as Cookie. While Henson usually shared the screen with big-name actors, Kelley L. Carter said Empire is \\"most certainly Henson's moment.\\" Carter praised Henson's portrayal of Cookie as well as the actor's previous characters and said that \\"Her characters consistently feel like real people the audience actually knows, thanks to the measured way in which she portrays black women who've endured hardships.\\" With Henson, Cookie doesn't become a \\"caricature\\" but instead is a \\"complicated woman who is far from one- dimensional,\\" thanks to the \\"emotional sensitivity\\" that Henson brings to the character. \\"If Samuel L. Jackson had a baby with Bette Davis, it would be Taraji\\", says Jussie Smollett, who plays Henson's son Jamal in the series. He continued, \\"She's the perfect leading lady.\\" Crime novelist Attica Locke joined the writing team after the Pilot and admitted that it was because of Cookie. \\"I felt like her character was unprecedented in that I'd never seen a woman or a mother like this on TV, so full of trouble and saying all the wrong things and yet you understand where she's coming from.\\" TV Guide's Michael Logan said Henson played Cookie with \\"fire and fabulosity.\\" Jamey Giddens from Daytime Confidential raved about Henson's portrayal of the \\"insurmountable\\" Cookie and said \\"just go ahead and hand the next six seasons worth of Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama series Emmys to Henson.\\" Giddens also appreciated the character's grit and joked, \\"Cookie is no Claire Huxtable.\\" Dave Wiengand of The Seattle Times said Henson as Cookie is \\"biggest magnet in the cast. With her claw-like fake nails and exaggerated wigs, Cookie's a force to be reckoned with, both by the other characters and the actors who play them.\\" Alyssa Rosenburg of The Washington Post said that Cookie is TV's \\"best new female character\\" of 2015. Jozen Cummings of The New York Post noted Cookie Lyon's similarities to real-life Sugar Hill Records co-founder Sylvia Robinson. In May 2015, Henson won the Critics' Choice Award for Best Actress in a Drama Series for her portrayal of Cookie. She was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Lead Actress in a Drama Series, but lost to Viola Davis for her role in the ABC legal drama series How To Get Away With Murder. In 2016, Henson won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a drama series. Later that year, Henson was nominated again for another Primetime Emmy Award for Lead Actress in a Drama Series, but lost to Tatiana Maslany for her role in the BBC America sci-fi drama series Orphan Black.

The specific epithet (laxiflora) is from the Latin words laxus, meaning \\"loose\\" or slack and -florus meaning \\"flowered\\" referring to the relatively wide separation between individual flowers in each spike. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs from the Mollerin district, south and east to the Ongerup and Norseman districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in sandy or clayey soils, often over granite, on flats and roadsides. Conservation status Melaleuca laxiflora is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This species has frequently been cultivated and is a hardy plant in a well- drained, sunny position. It is suited to semi-dry and temperate climates rather than humid areas.

The cover photographer is Michael Frost. The novel is recommended for ages 8‚Äì12 (grades 3-7).  Rapunzel: The One with All the Hair  The novel was published on June 1, 2014. It is 208 pages.  Plot  Rapunzel was in deep trouble. She was recently held prisoner by a witch as the result of a deal her parents made when she was born. Prince Benjamin craved to have a grand adventure travelling minstrels would compose songs about. His mother, however, was overly protective and watched him ‚Äúlike a hawk‚Äù. When the story began, Prince Benjamin was fetched for supper by his best friend Andrew. He was distressed to sit beside Prince Elkin, his ‚Äúever-bothersome, froglike‚Äù cousin. Meanwhile, Rapunzel has been weeping. She was hungry, aching, and homesick. The next day, Rapunzel woke to discover a little orange kitten on her feet. She named her Sir Kitty. When the witch appeared, Rapunzel threatened that her parents would find her soon. The witch laughed and told her she was far from any village. At the same time, Prince Benjamin was wandering far from the castle. His glasses fell and broke. He stumbled around until a boy approached him and brought him to his house. The boy's father mended his spectacles as if it were never broken. In conversation, Prince Benjamin discovered that all the boys born the three years following his birth were also named Benjamin. He also found although the boy's father was excellent at making spectacles, he had to clean dung chutes for a stable income. At late night, Andrew and Benjamin were furtively eating plum cakes in the kitchen. Benjamin admitted he wished for a way to prove himself and help the spectacle maker to work in his dream career. Andrew told him about a treasure cave in the Great Forest. A large, hairy troll guarded the entrance, so not even the bravest knights dared to approach it. If the prince defeated the troll, he could give the treasure to the spectacle maker. The next day, Prince Benjamin discovered that Elkin was back for training to be a prince. After a failed attempt at climbing down the tower, Rapunzel found a way to escape by looking into the mirror to see behind her when the witch was leaving. She found a trapdoor in the ceiling. Later that day, Rapunzel discovered to her disappointment that she could not reach the trapdoor. However, she kept the mirror with her at all times. Using the mirror, she watched a person with green skin climb down the rope and drop off her dinner. She realized it was not the witch who brought her small gifts in her time trapped; it was the green creature. She wrote a letter to thank him for his kindness. The next day, Prince Benjamin was given a map of the Great Forest and a book on trolls by Andrew. He was also notified by Elkin of his first hunt in six days. He learned that trolls were fatally allergic to tomatoes. When the hunting party splits up, he would ride off to the cave. Meanwhile, Rapunzel's hair kept growing longer. In her dinner vegetable stew, she discovered seven peas on top forming a happy face. Rapunzel woke up hours before dawn. She heard heaving sobs even though she was not crying. She discovered a round green face staring up at her. The creature introduced himself as Steven. Steven was in debt to the witch for saving his son when he suddenly could not breathe. The witch was the only person around, and she mumbled an incantation. A large bug flew out of Steven's son's throat. Steven asked what he could do to repay the witch, and the witch told him she needed a cook and guard. Therefore, Steven was stuck in the tower forever. If he leaves, his son would die. Meanwhile, Benjamin was called by his father to go over the rules of the hunt. As per tradition, he was forced to ride with Elkin. Andrew thought it would be best to tell Elkin about the plans to go to the cave. The next day, Rapunzel began to sing to keep her mind off the situation. She suddenly understood how to break the witch's bond with Steven. Another day later, the hunting day came for Benjamin. He told Elkin his plans. Elkin was ecstatic to find the treasure cave and escape from hunting‚Äîa reaction Benjamin did not expect. On the same day, Rapunzel explained her thinking to Steven: the bug that flew out of his son's mouth was controlled by the witch. The witch scared everyone else away so she was the only one around. Steven was not in debt at all. On the other hand, Rapunzel's mother was also bewitched when she made the deal. Steven and Rapunzel tried to escape the tower, but encountered the witch. Steven ran away, urged by Rapunzel. The witch dragged her up the stairs and tossed her trunk. The trapdoor was locked thereon, and Rapunzel was truly trapped. Meanwhile, Prince Benjamin and Elkin were searching for the cave. After a while, they found the cave, but they discovered the guard was not a troll, but an old hermit. Later that day, the witch visited Rapunzel. She asked her to let down her hair so she could climb up. Rapunzel discovered she was tricked. The witch had not brought her food, but a few branches. After the witch left, Rapunzel began singing again to release her stress. Meanwhile, Benjamin and Elkin were talking to the hermit. They discovered the treasure cave was merely a rumor to keep visitors away. Benjamin confessed to the hermit that he had been expecting to give the treasure to a villager. The hermit told him there were other ways to help the villager, and someone would be singing for him. When Benjamin left the cave, he got lost in the forest. However, he heard a girl singing. The horn signifying the end of the hunt was blown. Benjamin had to come back the next day to find the girl. Elkin shot some arrows onto nearby trees and dumped the rest on the ground to indicate the spot the singing was heard. Guided by the horses, the boys rejoined the hunting party. The next day, Benjamin rode off early to find the singing girl. Guided by his horse, he soon found a tall tower. He discovered a strange woman asking the girl to let down her hair, and did the same after the woman left. Rapunzel told Benjamin her story. Benjamin agreed to find silk to make a ladder so she could escape. Rapunzel found herself smiling long after the prince was gone. When Benjamin returned to the castle, he told Andrew and Elkin about Rapunzel. They stole silk from the seamstress's workroom at night. However, the next day, Benjamin found there was not enough silk. After Benjamin left to get more silk, every minute seemed like an hour for Rapunzel. When the witch finally visited, Rapunzel blurted that she was slow like the prince. The witch was infuriated. She cut Rapunzel's hair and slid down the hair ladder with her. Rapunzel felt angry at herself for blurting out and for not cutting off the braid to escape earlier. The witch tossed Rapunzel into a ring of tall bushes and took off. Rapunzel did the only thing she could: sing. Benjamin soon reached the tower. However, when he climbed up, he only encountered the furious witch. He was struck to the wall and tossed out the tower. Fortunately, his horse softened his fall. His glasses were broken, and he had no choice but to trust his horse. Benjamin's horse trudged further and further into the forest until it was dusk. He heard Rapunzel singing again: the horse had led him to her. After tossing the cloak over the bushes so Rapunzel would not be scraped by the prickles, Benjamin was given a pair of glasses. Apparently, he left them in the tower. Rapunzel suggested he hire a full-time spectacle maker. Benjamin was immediately inspired to hire the villager. Benjamin and Rapunzel finally returned to the castle at midnight. Elkin had told Benjamin's mother and father about Rapunzel. The castle guards had trapped the witch inside the tower. In the morning, Benjamin woke to the singing of fifty boys who were his namesakes. They were singing a song about the prince. Benjamin's dream was achieved. Rapunzel's parents arrived as she was eating breakfast. The hermit and Steven arrived soon after. The hermit revealed that Steven bolted past his cave just before Benjamin and Elkin visited. The hermit promised Steven he would find help for Rapunzel.  Sleeping Beauty: The One Who Took the Really Long Nap  The novel was published on April 1, 2012. It is 176 pages.  Plot  Princess Rose was cursed by a fairy at her christening ceremony. She would slumber for a century after being pierced by a spindle. The Prince's mother was an ogre. She banned all beautiful objects and people from the castle, and sought blood on the second and fourth Thursdays of a month. Everything in the castle was dusted and turned dull. Princess Rose was constantly supervised and avoided all pointy objects. On her eighth birthday, she invited four girls, including a girl from town called Sara. All the girls except Sara were displeased by the constant supervision of the ladies-in- waiting. A few weeks after Rose's birthday, Sara's mother moved her family to another part of town with a blacksmith and his five children in a tiny house. Rose wanted Sara to stay in the castle. She became her new lady-in-waiting. Meanwhile, a hundred years later, the Prince's new page, Jonathan, taught the Prince how to survive in the wild, since he ran away often. When he first ran away, he glimpsed a familiar building on the castle grounds, hidden by vines. When the Prince was fourteen, he discovered a small separation of the vines over a window of the mysterious building. He saw a castle library that looked exactly like the one in his castle. The Prince wanted to discuss this with Jonathan, but found that he went to be a squire. The Prince was devastated. He spent nearly a month in the forest. When he returned home, he was told he was in charge, since his father and mother had gone to a meeting. The Prince saw this as an opportunity to learn more about the history of the castle, so he invited the oldest people in the kingdom and neighboring towns for tea. During teatime, he discovered that his castle used to be a field, and the old castle used to be farther away. One day, the castle spontaneously relocated. It moved just less than a hundred years ago, right after Princess Rose disappeared. When Princess Rose was sixteen, she visited her cousins. She wandered around and found an old woman. She saw a sewing machine for the first time, and was amazed at her natural talent. She was just being passed a spindle as her parents and Sara arrived, but then, it was too late. After he learned about the castle's history, the Prince dreamed of a fairy handing him a book. He searched for it in the library when he woke. Inside the book was a pamphlet about the story of a fairy who saved Princess Rose. The truth dawned on the Prince. The night before the Prince's sixteenth birthday, he could not sleep. He stared at the mermaid fountain outside the castle. Suddenly, for a split second, it came alive. He checked on his hidden rosebush. One rose was blooming in the patch even though it is nighttime. He realized the next day marked a hundred years after the princess was put to sleep. In the morning of the Prince's sixteenth birthday, he arrived at the door of the castle. The vines parted. He kissed the princess and awakened her. However, the princess was horrified that everyone she loved and knew was dead. The Prince and princess walked through the gardens. They discovered that the princess could not walk past an invisible wall around the old castle grounds. When they returned to the old castle, Princess Rose found Sara waiting for her. Sara had requested to sleep along with Rose and wake when she woke. The Prince returned to his castle to take care of things at home. He was worried that since Princess Rose was beautiful, his part-ogre mother would not accept her. Rose might also abandon him if she knew about his mother. When the Prince returned home, he was on constant supervision. His enemy, Percival, told his father that he was imagining things. He could not return to Princess Rose on time. The Prince sought help from the falconer. He told him the story. The falconer offered to cause a distraction that would divert the guards‚Äô attention that night. At dinner, the Prince encountered a fairy, who told him that the princess could not leave the old castle grounds until his parents have accepted her. The falconer's diversion worked. However, the Prince was spotted. He ran to the old castle, hid with Rose and Sara, and locked the room door. The Prince told Rose about his mother, and Rose chose to rub dirt on her face and cut her hair haphazardly. The Prince's mother was happy at the Prince's choice for a mate. Suddenly, the colors of the old castle faded. The two castles had merged into one. The Prince and Princess Rose lived happily ever after.

It was never translated to English: \\"Es geht darum, aus der F√ºlle banaler Begebenheiten meines Lebens etwas herauszufiltern, das vielleicht Interesse finden k√∂nnte und das ich darum hier erw√§hnen m√∂chte. 1984 hat f√ºr mein Schicksal zwei Jubil√§en gebracht, die f√ºr den ersten Abschnitt meines Lebens wichtig und entscheidend wurden. 50 Jahre (1934) sind es her, da√ü ich als Kind mit meinen Eltern nach Deutschland kam und 40 Jahre (1944) sind vergangen, da√ü sich dieses Kapitel abschlo√ü mit dem Beginn meiner Zeit in der Kriegsgefangenschaft. Die dazwischenliegenden Jahre haben gewi√ü aus mir einen Musiker gemacht. Das Mitsingen im Leipziger Thomanerchor, die Zeit meiner Aushilfst√§tigkeit als Fl√∂tist in manchen Programmen des Gewandhausorchesters, erste Erfahrungen in der Kammermusik und die starken Eindr√ºcke gro√üer Musiker und gro√üer Pers√∂nlichkeiten, wie Karl Straube, Theodor Biebrich und meines Fl√∂tenlehrers Carl Bartuzat haben ihre Wirkung nicht verfehlt. Zeitlich davor liegt die Zeit im Elternhaus mit dem Eindruck von Harmonie und Gl√ºck der Kindheit, aber auch mit der Selbstverst√§ndlichkeit, da√ü der Mensch erst mit dem Musiker anf√§ngt, als solcher diskutabel zu werden. Ohne Zweifel hat mein Vater meine ganze Jugend von Anfang an aufs entschiedenste beeinflu√üt und gepr√§gt. Einerseits habe ich bei ihm, spielend und nachahmend, alle Facetten des musikalischen Handwerks und die dazugeh√∂rige Weltanschauung gelernt. Anderseits hat er aber auch klargestellt, da√ü Musik ein edler Teil unseres Lebens sei, da√ü man aber auch dieses ganze Leben kennen m√ºsse. Mit anderen Worten, er hat einen umfassenden Bildungsanspruch an mich gestellt und ich bem√ºhe mich noch heute, diesem nachzukommen. Die folgenden Ereignisse der Gefangenschaft m√∂chte ich insoweit √ºbergehen, als ich annehme, da√ü jedermann wei√ü, da√ü das f√ºr keinen ohne Schrammen abgegangen ist. Ein russischer Freund, dem ich vor kurzem einiges erz√§hlte, meinte dazu aber: \\"Sie haben wirklich ein romantisches Leben gehabt.\\" Ich hatte das bisher nicht so empfunden, mu√ü aber zugeben, da√ü mein Schicksal von unglaublichem Gl√ºck beg√ºnstigt war, in der Gestalt einiger weniger Personen auf der russischen Seite, die mein Leben retteten, meine Wunden pflegten und schlie√ülich meine recht fr√ºhe Heimfahrt erm√∂glichten. Das wird f√ºr mich immer ein Wunder reiner Menschlichkeit bleiben. Die Liebe zu diesen Menschen und zur russischen Sprache ist mir davon geblieben. Die f√ºr mich schwierigen Jahre und die teilweise chaotischen Probleme der Nachkriegsjahre in Salzburg, T√ºbingen und Stuttgart m√∂chte ich √ºbergehen. Wesentlich daran ist, da√ü ich sie √ºberwinden und da√ü ich sie durch meinen Beginn in Wien absch√ºtteln konnte. Dr. Hans Sittner hat mir zu diesem Beginn geholfen und darum meinen unverg√§nglichen Dank. Wien brachte mir die allm√§hliche geistige L√∂sung von meinem Vater und in der Folge die Findung meiner selbst. Das Jahr in Rom und die 7 Jahre in Teheran betrachte ich als Gewinn neuer Dimensionen. Dazu geh√∂ren erstens viele Sprachen und kulturelle Einsichten, die erst den Stil meines heutigen Lebens m√∂glich machen. Der Orient brachte mich in Beziehung zum Wesen seiner Menschen und erweckte in mir eine verst√§rkte Sensibilisierung des Lebens und bewirkte dadurch auch eine Wendung zu noch mehr Ausdruck in der Kunst. Gerne wollte ich ein Wort von Hokusai etwas abwandeln und f√ºr mich umm√ºnzen: Ich habe immer gerne und viel gearbeitet, war am Anfang leider eigensinnig und stolz. Ich wollte immer nur tun, was mir Freude und Vergn√ºgen bereitete und hatte es daher immer besonders schwer. Langsam erkannte ich, da√ü Musik erst jenseits alles Technischen und aller Doktrine beginnt, n√§mlich dort, wo Freude und Leid mit den gleichen T√∂nen in uns dringen. Seither bin ich auf diesem Wege bem√ºht, dieser Wahrheit noch pr√§ziser nachzusp√ºren. Vielleicht gelingt es mir einmal, etwas zu schreiben, das in jeder Note Ausdruck dieser Wahrheit sein darf, bevor ich an die Schwelle komme, hinter der die Vollkommenheit jeder Musik verborgen ist.\\" References Category:1925 births Category:2006 deaths Category:20th-century Austrian conductors (music) Category:20th-century male musicians Category:Austrian composers Category:Austrian flautists Category:Austrian male composers Category:Male conductors (music) Category:Musicians from Leipzig Category:University of Tehran faculty ","title":"Thomas Christian David"},{"id":"45676177","text":"George Randall (1895‚Äì1955) was an Australian actor with extensive experience on stage and radio.

It is native to coastal eastern Australia. It gains its common name from its transparent appearance. Taxonomy German-British naturalist Albert G√ºnther described Ambassis marianus in 1880 from a specimen collected from the Mary River near the village of Tiaro, some twenty miles upstream from Maryborough, on an expedition in May 1874. William John Macleay described a specimen from Port Jackson (Sydney) as Pseudoambassis ramsayi. Charles Walter De Vis described Pseudoambassis convexus from a Queensland specimen in 1884. Both of these are now regarded as synonyms of Ambassis marianus. This species and the co-occurring Port Jackson glassfish (A. jacksoniensis) are the only two members of the genus found in temperate waters. The others are found in the waters of northern Australia and southeast Asia. Distribution and habitat It is native to coastal eastern Australia, from Maryborough in central Queensland through to Narooma in southern New South Wales. It lives in estuaries and protected brackish tidal streams that have mangroves growing along the margins. Ecology A controlled study comparing six native fish species with the introduced (and invasive) eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) on consuming larvae of the common banded mosquito (Culex annulirostris) in Brisbane found that the estuary glassfish was as efficient at eating mosquito larvae as the eastern mosquitofish and is a good candidate for mosquito control.

India Many police departments in India have procured drones for law and order and aerial surveillance. United States In 2005, a fixed wing drone was used by the Irwin County Sheriff's Office in Georgia to assist in the search for Tara Grinstead. Ms. Grinstead was a local teacher and former beauty queen and her disappearance caused a great deal of concern in the small town of Ocilla, Georgia. A private search firm, Texas Equusearch, was called in to assist with the search. Texas Equusearch brought in drone specialist Gene Robinson of RPFlightSystems, Inc. to begin the imaging of large areas that could have possibly held clues to her whereabouts. This was the first televised (Court TV) use of a drone in police work in the U.S. The victim was not found during that effort but in February 2017, one of her former students who was not even a person of interest (POI) confessed to the murder of Ms. Grinstead to the Georgia Bureau of Investigations (GBI). The killer led the GBI to an area some 10 miles north of Ocilla where possible human remains were found. This use of the fixed drone (Spectra) is likely the \\"ground zero\\" of drone use by civilian police in the U.S. In 2011, a Predator drone was used to assist an arrest in North Dakota. In February 2013, Seattle mayor Michael McGinn ordered the Seattle Police Department to abandon plans to use UAVs after objections from residents. Two DraganflyerX6 craft had been purchased with a federal grant and the police had been granted FAA approval though they had not started using them. The vehicles were to be returned to the manufacturer. Seattle Police Department had announced in October 2012 that they were drafting a policy and they were one of the first police forces in the United States to receive approval from the federal government to use UAVs. Opponents of the programme included the Washington chapter of the ACLU. The ACLU has also been concerned with privacy over drones that the Los Angeles Police Department had acquired. UAVs can be powerful surveillance tools by carrying camera systems capable of license plate scanning and thermal imaging as well as radio equipment and other sensors. The Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a Freedom of Information Act request on 10 January 2012 against the Federal Aviation Administration. As a result of the request, the FAA released a list of the names of all public and private entities that have applied for authorizations to fly UAVs domestically. Some of these government licenses belong to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a component of the Department of Homeland Security. UAVs have been used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to patrol United States borders since 2005, and the agency currently owns 10 UAVs with plans to use armed drones. A May 2012, report issued by the DHS Inspector General found that CBP \\"needs to improve planning of its unmanned aircraft systems program to address its level of operation, program funding, and resource requirements, along with stakeholder needs\\". Also, despite the Bureau‚Äôs limited mission to safeguard the borders, the Bureau often flies missions for the FBI, the Department of Defense, NOAA, local law enforcement, and other agencies. In December 2011, the CBP made headlines when reporters discovered that the agency's UAVs were being used to assist local law enforcement in relation to cattle raiding in North Dakota without receiving prior approval from the FAA or any other agency. Individuals in the United States have few legal privacy protections from aerial surveillance conducted through UAVs. In Florida v. Riley, the United States Supreme Court held that individuals do not have the right to privacy from police observation from public airspace. The weakness of legal protection from UAV surveillance have led to calls from civil liberties advocacy groups for the U.S. government to issue laws and regulations that establish both privacy protections and greater transparency regarding the use of UAVs to gather information about individuals. As an example, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has warned of a \\"nightmare scenario\\" in the future where the police might be able, with computer technology, to combine mobile phone tracking with video data and build up a database of people's routine daily movements. On 24 February 2012, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, joined by over 100 organizations, experts, and members of the public, submitted a petition to the FAA requesting a public rule-making on the privacy impact of UAV use in U.S. airspace. In June 2012, Senator Rand Paul and Representative Austin Scott both introduced legislation that would require law enforcement to obtain a warrant before using a UAV to conduct surveillance of criminal activities. EPIC has stated that transparency and accountability must be built into the FAA's system of UAV/UAS/RPV regulation in order to provide basic protections to the public. While Congress rapidly moves ahead to authorize further use of domestic UAVs, many remain skeptical regarding privacy concerns. Some privacy scholars argue that the domestic use of UAVs for surveillance will ultimately benefit privacy by encouraging society to demand greater privacy rights. FBI Director Robert Mueller testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on 19 June 2013 that the FBI owns and uses UAVs for the purposes of \\"surveillance\\". In 2014, the California State Senate passed rules imposing strict regulations on how law enforcement and other government agencies can use drones. The legislation would require law enforcement agencies to obtain a warrant before using an unmanned aircraft, or drone, except in emergencies. Approximately 167 police and fire departments bought unmanned aerial vehicles in the United States in 2016, double the number that were purchased in 2015. United Kingdom In March 2014, Sussex Police announced a pilot project using an Aeryon Skyranger for three months at Gatwick Airport. The project was funded by the Association of Chief Police Officers to test the effectiveness of the technology in policing. The equipment cost ¬£35,000 with the training of four police officers costing ¬£10,000. In October 2014 it was reported that five English police forces (Merseyside, Staffordshire, Essex, Wiltshire and the West Midlands) had obtained or operated unmanned aerial vehicles for observation.(22 October 2014) UK drones: Concern over increase in use BBC News UK, Retrieved 22 October 2014 In 2007, Merseyside Police was reported to be conducting tests with a UAV. Merseyside Police caught a car thief with a UAV in 2010, but about a week later had to stop UAV operations as the UAV was not licensed. Regulations introduced at the start of 2010 required any aerial surveillance by unmanned aircraft - no matter the size of the drone - to be licensed. A licence was granted by the Civil Aviation Authority but the UAV was lost soon after during a training exercise in Aigburth, Liverpool, when it crashed in the River Mersey. and the police stated the UAV would not be replaced due to operational limitations and the cost of staff training.

Amongst the many libretti he produced, largely for the opera houses of Venice, were those for Vivaldi's Ottone in villa and Alessandro Scarlatti's Tigrane. A member of the Accademia degli Arcadi, he also wrote under his arcadian name \\"Ortanio\\". Lalli was born and raised in Naples as the adopted son of Fulvio Caracciolo but fled the city after being implicated in a bank fraud. After two years wandering about Italy in the company of Emanuele d'Astorga, he settled in Venice in 1710 and worked as the \\"house poet\\" of the Grimani family's theatres for the rest of his career. In addition to his stage works, Lalli published several volumes of poetry and a collection of biographies of the kings of Naples. He died in Venice at the age of 62. Biography Coat of arms of the Banco della Santissima Annunziata, where Lalli worked from 1700 to 1706 Early life Modern accounts of Lalli's life prior to arriving in Venice are largely based on a biography included in a book of poetry which he published in 1732. The biography was written by the Venetian poet Giovanni Boldini who collaborated with Lalli on several of his libretti.Tavazzi, Valeria (2014). Carlo Goldoni dal San Samuele al \\"Teatro comico\\", pp. 49‚Äì81. Accademia University Press A further biography of Lalli by Andrea Mazzarella was published in 1818 in Biografia degli uomini illustri del Regno di Napoli. Sebastiano Biancardi, as he was then known, was born in Naples to Caterina (n√©e Amendola) and Michele Biancardi. His father's family were originally merchants from Milan who had moved to Naples in the Middle Ages. At the age of 11 months, he was adopted by Fulvio Caracciolo, a member of a Neapolitan noble family and the second son of the Duke of Martina. Under Caracciolo he was educated in law and literature and was exposed to many prominent Neapolitan intellectuals, such as Giambattista Vico, who frequented the house. His adoptive father died in 1692, leaving Biancardi as his sole heir. At the age of 18, with both his natural and adoptive parents dead, he married Giustina Baroni. According to a late 18th-century biography of Lalli by Eustachio D'Afflitto, she was the sister of the Bishop of Calvi.D'Afflitto, Eustachio (1794). \\"Biancardi (Sebastiano)\\". Memorie degli scrittori del Regno di Napoli, Vol, 2, pp. 118‚Äì125. Stamperia Simoniana By 1700, Biancardi had gone through most of his inheritance and with an ever-growing family to support took up a post as chief cashier at the bank of the Santissima Annunziata.Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani (1968). \\"Biancardi, Sebastiano\\".

Oxford University Press Flight from Naples Emanuele d'Astorga, Lalli's travelling companion on his flight from Naples In 1706 a large amount of money was found to be missing from the Santissima Annunziata's funds, and Biancardi was eventually suspected of embezzlement. Leaving his wife and 13 children behind, he fled Naples for Rome. There he befriended Emanuele d'Astorga, a composer and son of a Sicilian aristocrat, who used Biancardi's poems as texts for several of his cantatas and serenatas. Over the next two years Biancardi and d'Astorga wandered through Italy together. Left destitute after they were robbed by their servant in Genoa, they managed to scrape together some money when d'Astorga set a libretto for an impresario of the opera house there. They then headed for Venice, but fearful that their servant was still pursuing them they changed their names. D'Astorga became \\"Giuseppe del Chiaro\\". Biancardi became \\"Domenico Lalli\\", the name by which he was known for the rest of his career and which appears in the Venetian records of his second marriage.Boldini, Giovanni (1732). \\"Compendio della Vita del Sig. Bastian B√¨iancardi Napoletano, detto Domenico Lall√≠\\" in Rime di Bastian Biancardi. Giuseppe Lovisa On their way to Venice, they were arrested and imprisoned for not having passports and passing themselves off as Romans. They were only freed after Lalli wrote a letter to the Governor of Milan, recounting the robbery by their servant and their subsequent misfortunes. They arrived in Venice in 1709 and made the acquaintance of the influential poet and librettist Apostolo Zeno. This was accomplished by d'Astorga writing a fake letter to Zeno purporting to be from Baron d'Astorga in Palermo and recommending to him two young men in need of patronage‚Äî\\"Giuseppe del Chiaro, maestro di cappella\\", and \\"Domenico Lalli, professor of literature and lute player\\". Lalli and d'Astorga then spent some time in Mantua under their new identities, but remained in constant fear that visitors from Rome would recognize them. D'Astorga left for Barcelona when he was offered a post at the court of Charles III, and Lalli returned to Venice. Title page of a collection of Lalli's poetry published in 1732 displaying the crest of the Accademia degli Arcadi Venetian career According to Mazzarella's 1818 biography of Lalli, on his return to Venice he recited some of his poetry to Zeno and asked for his opinion. Zeno recognized the poems which had been published several years earlier in Naples and said that while the poetry had merit, Lalli was either a plagiarist or was actually Sebastiano Biancardi. At this point, Lalli revealed his true identity to Zeno and confessed to the reason he had left Naples. Zeno took him under his wing and introduced him to the Grimani family who hired Lalli to assist in the management of their theatres (Teatro San Samuele and Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo) and to re-work older libretti for new productions. He eventually became the Grimani \\"house poet\\". Musicologist and historian Reinhard Strohm, described Lalli's role in the Venetian theatres, and especially those of the Grimani family, as \\"resourceful poet and hack, theatre manager and career- maker.\\" According to Strohm, he proved particularly useful in obtaining the latest libretti written by Metastasio for Rome, slightly revising them and having them set by another composer for a rival production in Venice. In one case, he managed to do this even before the Rome premiere. Metastasio's Ezio had its official premiere in Rome on 26 December 1728 with music by Pietro Auletta. However, a setting by Nicola Porpora of the slightly altered libretto had premiered at the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo a month earlier. The Venetian version carried a dedication written by Lalli to Count Harrach, the Austrian viceroy of Naples.Servizio Bibliotecario Nazionale (Venice catalog). Document VEA1176146T: Ezio: Dramma Per Musica. Retrieved 23 March 2015 . Lalli's first original opera libretto, L'amor tirannico (\\"Tyrannical Love\\") was performed with music by Francesco Gasparini in 1710 at the Teatro San Cassiano in Venice. L'amor tirranico had considerable success and was also performed in Milan in 1713 and again in Venice in 1722. His comic opera Elisa with music by Giovanni Maria Ruggieri followed in 1711. According to Giovanni Carlo Bonlini, it was the first opera buffa to be presented in Venice.Selfridge-Field, Eleanor (2007). A New Chronology of Venetian Opera and Related Genres, 1660‚Äì1760, pp. 298, 306, 324, 328, 334, 338, 343, 433, 615. Stanford University Press In the ensuing years he went on to produce the libretti for numerous opere serie, including at least five for Vivaldi, three for Albinoni and two for Alessandro Scarlatti. Writing in 1811, Pietro Napoli- Signorelli described Tigrane, the first libretto Lalli wrote for Scarlatti, as \\"full of oddities and fantasy\\" and displaying \\"great inventiveness in its design\\". Lalli became very well connected to figures in the intellectual and theatrical life of Venice and to the aristocrats who patronized its theatres. Zeno jokingly referred to the gatherings at Lalli's house as the \\"Accademia Lalliana\\" (\\"Lallian Academy\\"). Lalli was also a member of an actual academy, the Accademia degli Arcadi. The academy's pan pipe symbol appears on the title pages of some of his published poetry, and two of his intermezzi (La cantatrice and Il tropotipo) were published under his arcadian name \\"Ortanio\\". In 1723, in addition to his work for the Venetian theatres, Lalli became the court poet for Maximilian Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria and later his son Carl Albert.Warren, F.M. (May 1888). \\"Italian Literature in Bavaria\\". Modern Language Notes, pp. 282‚Äì284. He wrote numerous poems and several libretti for royal celebrations in Bavaria, including I veri amici with music by Albinoni for the wedding celebrations of Carl Albert to Maria Amalia of Austria in 1722. The opera was performed again in Venice the following year, in a slightly revised version. He also worked with Antonio Caldara, who was the maestro di cappella of the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, writing the libretti for two of Caldara's operas presented at the court theatre there. Apart from his libretti, Lalli also published poetry and prose works in Venice under his real name. He brought out a collection of twenty sonnets in praise of Francesco del Giudice in 1715 and two volumes of his collected poetry, Rime di Bastian Biancardi and Rime berniesche di Bastian Biancardi in 1732. Most of the work in the 1732 collections was new, but they also included a few poems previously published in Naples, including one on the death of his adoptive father, Fulvio Caracciolo.Biancardi, Sebastiano (1732).

Francesco Giudice Lalli's Italian translation of Rousset de Missy's history of Russia during the reign of Catherine the Great, Memorie del regno di Catterina imperadrice e sovrana di tutta la Russia, was published in 1730. Final years Church of Santa Maria Formosa in Venice where Lalli was buried in 1741 (painting by Bernardo Bellotto circa 1742) By the mid-1730s, Lalli's career as a librettist was waning, and he was eventually replaced by Goldoni as the director of the Grimani theatres. After the death of his first wife, he had married a Venetian woman, Barbara Pazini, who provided him with many more children to support. He eked out a living writing dedications to illustrious theatre patrons on re- worked libretti, brought out collections of Biblical proverbs and parables translated into verse, and with the help of his close friend and fellow Neapolitan exile Pietro Giannone wrote a collection of biographies of the kings of Naples which he published in 1737. Goldoni's contemporary, Gasparo Gozzi, lamented that Lalli's financial predicament was commonplace for those working in the arts in 18th-century Venice and described him as a man \\"who was born rich and died a poet\\".Monnier, Philippe (1910). Venice in the Eighteenth Century, p. 77. Chatto & Windus Lalli himself alluded to these problems in several poems in his 1732 Rime berniesche. The restoration of the Bourbon king Charles VII to the throne of Naples in 1735, raised Lalli's hopes of being able to return to his native city. In 1738 he wrote the libretto for Partenope nell'Adria, a serenata composed by Ignazio Fiorillo celebrating the marriage of Charles to Maria Amalia of Saxony and described himself on the title page as the King's \\"fedelissimo vassallo\\" (\\"most faithful vassal\\"). The following year he published a continuation of his biographies of the kings of Naples concentrating on the \\"gloriosa persona di Don Carlo di Borbone\\" (\\"the glorious figure of Don Charles of Bourbon\\"). He repeatedly petitioned the king for a royal pardon allowing him to return to Naples but without success. Lalli died in poverty in Venice at the age of 62 and was buried in the Church of Santa Maria Formosa. Libretti According to Reinhard Strohm, at least 22 original or significantly re-worked opera libretti can be attributed to Lalli. Apart from his 1711 comic opera Elisa and four comic intermezzi, the remainder of the opera libretti attributed to him are all in the opera seria and dramma per musica genres. Lalli also wrote texts and libretti for several musical works in other genres: cantatas, serenatas, and azioni sacri (stage works on religious subjects and precursors of the oratorio). Albinoni. The opera is dedicated to Prince Carl Albert of Bavaria who was visiting Italy at the time. The attribution of some of Lalli's opera libretti is complicated by the fact that from 1728 he often collaborated with Giovanni Boldini. In some cases the libretti are listed as jointly authored. In other cases there is disagreement as to whether Lalli or Boldini was the author, e.g. the libretto for L'Issipile set by Giovanni Porta in 1732 and that for Artaserse set by Adolph Hasse in 1730. Some libretti by Lalli and/or Boldini were primarily re- workings of libretti by other authors although with the text much changed, as was the case with Hasse's 1730 Artaserse based on a libretto by Metastasio.Hansell, Sven (2001). \\"Artaserse (ii). Grove Music Online. Retrieved 14 March 2015 (subscription required for full text). Lalli's own libretti were often reworked to a greater or lesser extent by other librettists, including his Amor tirranico originally set by Francesco Gasparini in 1710 and reworked with minor changes by Nicola Haym for Handel's Radamisto.Parker, Mary Ann (2005).

The gravitational lens effect was first derived by Einstein, and the concept of a mission to the solar gravitational lens was first suggested by professor Von Eshleman,Eshleman in 1979, Von R., \\"Gravitational lens of the sun: its potential for observations and communications over interstellar distances,\\" Science, Vol. 205, No. 4411 (1979) pp. 1133-1135. and analyzed further by Italian astronomer Claudio Maccone and others.Turyshev, S. G. and Andersson, B-G., ‚ÄúThe 550-AU Mission: a critical discussion‚Äù, Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 341, pp. 577‚Äì582 (2003). In order to use the Sun as a gravity lens, it would be necessary to send the telescope to a minimum distance of 550 astronomical units away from the Sun, enabling very high signal amplifications: for example, at the 203 GHz wavelength, amplification of 1.3¬∑1015. Maccone suggests that this should be enough to obtain detailed images of the surfaces of extrasolar planets. Other uses of the mission Even without using the Sun as the lens, FOCAL could perform various, otherwise impossible measurements: a telescope could be used to measure stellar distances by parallax, which would, using the baseline of 550 AU, measure the precise position of every star in the Milky Way, enabling various further scientific discoveries. It could also study the interstellar medium, the heliosphere, observe gravitational waves, check for the possible variation of the gravitational constant, observe the cosmic infrared background, characterise interplanetary dust within the Solar system, more precisely measure the mass of the Solar system and similar.  Limitations  FOCAL does not require any non-existing technology; however, it has various limitations. A space mission of this duration and distance has never been attempted; for comparison, the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes are at distances of 147 AU and 122 AU in 2019.Most distant space probes. A gravity lens will bend objects behind it, so that images from the telescope would be difficult to interpret. FOCAL would be able to observe only objects that are right behind the Sun from its point of view, which means that for every observed object a new telescope would have to be made. A critique of the technology of the gravity lens telescope was given by Landis.Landis, Geoffrey A., ‚ÄúMission to the Gravitational Focus of the Sun: A Critical Analysis,‚Äù paper AIAA-2017-1679, AIAA Science and Technology Forum and Exposition 2017, Grapevine TX, January 9‚Äì13, 2017. Preprint at arXiv.org (accessed 24 December 2016). Some of the problems Landis points out include discussion of the interference of the solar corona, which will make the telescope signal-to-noise ratio poor, the high magnification of the target, which will make the design of the mission focal plane difficult, and an analysis of the inherent spherical aberration of the lens will limit the resolution possible.

He was educated at Bedford Modern School and later qualified as a Chartered Accountant which he practiced for the rest of his life while still pursuing his main interest as an ornithologist. Clarke was said to have been 'vaguely interested in birds from his youth' but he was keener on playing lead guitar in a rock band until hearing damage ended his musical career. It was in fact a love of angling that steered him towards ornithology. In 1981 he moved to Reach to fish pike and bream and would watch hen harriers hunting over the landscape. Ornithological work Henharrier Marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus) female Two years later he teamed up with the artist Donald Watson to develop the UK Hen Harrier Winter Roost Survey. The thesis for Clarke's PhD in biological sciences, awarded by the University of Liverpool in 1999, was on bird of prey feeding ecology. Working for the University of Aberdeen, Clarke focused on Orkney hen harrier feeding. He also contributed to the controversial Joint Raptor Study Langholm Project, studying the predation of red grouse by hen harriers and peregrine falcons in southwest Scotland's border country. Clarke's reputation took him to India to study the world's largest harrier roosts for the Bombay Natural History Society. He subsequently worked on a project that successfully reintroduced red kites to several English regions. Clarke's first book, Harriers of the British Isles, appeared in 1990. It was followed by The Marsh Harrier (1995) and Montagu's Harrier (1996). He was co-editor of Biology and Conservation of Small Falcons in 1993 and during the final months before his early death he worked on the second edition of The Hen Harrier, adding to the first edition written by Watson. Clarke was treasurer of the British Ornithologists' Union (2000‚Äì06). He also looked after the accounts of the Society of Wildlife Artists (SWLA), whose then president, Bruce Pearson, was among his friends. His collection of more than 200 works of wildlife art formed part of a SWLA exhibition staged at the Mall Galleries, London in 2007. Personal life The weekend before Clarke's death, Pearson took him, by then wheelchair bound, five miles into the heart of the fens. Hen and marsh harriers floated into view over the marshes, a final encounter with two bird species that had inspired his ornithological career. Clarke was survived by his wife, Janis, and by a son and daughter.

At that point, he was accorded the style of duc de Guiche, since he was the heir presumptive to the Dukedom of Gramont. In 1801, he succeeded a cousin as the 8th Duke of Gramont and the Prince of Bidache. He served as a captain in the Royal Garde du Corps before fleeing to Britain at the outset of the French Revolution. He remained loyal to the House of Bourbon, becoming a military commander under Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoul√™me.

It was built by Antonio de Ord√≥√±ez y Alcocer, the owner of the mine, to give thanks to his patron saint, Saint Cajetan, for the riches the mine provided. The church is noted for use of gold leaf, especially the main altarpieces which are completely covered in the metal. The church is also a site of the Festival Internacional Cervantino. Description Located on one of the hillsides overlooking the city of Guanajuato, on the highway that leads to Dolores Hidalgo, the church is an important example of Mexican Churrigueresque style. The church is built of pink volcanic stone (cantera), fronted by an irregular shaped atrium surrounded by a wall topped by merlons. Around the main and side entrances, this stone is intricately carved to form altarpieces. The two doors of the main entrance are typical for the time, carved from fine wood. The interior layout is that of a Latin cross, with a notable octagonal cupola at the intersection. The chancel holds three very large Churrigueresque altarpieces, all covered in gold leaf, with the one in the center dedicated to Saint Cajetan. The church still has some of the original furnishings such as the pulpit and the organ. The baptismal font dates from the 19th century and is of a different style from the rest of the building. There are also several paintings by Luis Monroy done at the end of the 19th century. The annex of the church houses the archives of the University of Guanajuato. History Front facade La Valenciana is one of several churches that were built at the openings of mines in Guanajuato, such as the Cata and Rayas churches. The building of this church was sponsored by Antonio de Ord√≥√±ez y Alcocer, to give thanks to his patron Saint Cajetan (San Cayetano in Spanish). The La Valenciana mine was first worked in 1558, but abandoned in 1559 as it was thought to be exhausted. The earnings from the mine financed the building of the church. Ord√≥√±ez dug various mines and went broke many times until he reopened Valenciana mine in 1760. Digging 80 meters, he found the largest silver vein ever in Mexico, according to Baron von Humboldt who studied operations here in the late 18th century. The find earned him the noble title of Count of La Valenciana and Viscount of the Mine granted by Carlos III in 1780. Construction of the church was begun in 1775 under architect Andr√©s de la Riva and master carpenter Manuel Antonio de C√°rdenas. Both died before the project was completed, with their roles taken over by Jorge Archundia and Jos√© Sim√≥n Cayetano Tovar respectively. The project was completed in 1788, with the dedication to Saint Cajetan. The family of the count also intended to found a monastery for the Theatine order, constructing a house for the monks, but it was never occupied. Since its construction the church has lost a bell tower and several saints from its facade. In 2014, concerns have been raised about the church‚Äôs condition, especially the remaining bell tower, mostly from water damage and the accumulation of dust on the altarpieces. The church is one of the sites of the Festival Internacional Cervantino.

He is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley Department of Music and also serves as music director of the UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra and the Eco Ensemble. Biography Milnes was born in Long Island, New York to a musical family and attended Half Hollow Hills West High School in Dix Hills. From early childhood, Milnes played a variety of instruments, including piano, clarinet, saxophone, cello, flute, violin, and organ. He received his BA in Music (concentrating in conducting and clarinet performance) from Stony Brook University in 1978, and went on to receive a Masters and Doctorate in conducting from the Yale School of Music under the tutelage of Otto-Werner Mueller. Milnes also studied with esteemed conductors as Leonard Bernstein, Erich Leinsdorf, and Herbert Blomstedt. Career Milnes began his professional career after receiving his Masters at Yale by winning a conducting position with the Exxon Conducting Program. His conducting debut with the San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra in November 1983 involved conducting a side-by-side performance of the Overture to Richard Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg with the San Francisco Symphony. He became the music director of the Youth Orchestra in 1984. Milnes went on to become a frequent conductor in Eastern Europe and Russia. As principal guest conductor of the Latvian National Symphony Orchestra, Milnes conducted a wide breadth of repertoire, including the works of Hector Berlioz and Steve Reich. Following several conducting engagements, Milnes went on to join the faculty at SUNY Purchase and Southern Methodist University, at which he conducted the school's symphony orchestras and lectured on the symphonic repertoire. In 1994, David Milnes was nominated for a Grammy Award for his recording of Zingari by John Anthony Lennon. Milnes also conducted extensively at the Curtis Institute of Music (most notably a production of Idomeneo by Mozart). In 1996, Milnes joined the faculty at UC Berkeley with an intent to increase performance of the twentieth century repertoire, including the works of Stravinsky, Shostakovich, and Prokofiev. The Symphony under Milnes' direction also heavily emphasizes the performance of new music, frequently composed by Berkeley graduate students in composition. From 2002 to 2009, Milnes was also the music director of the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players.

It was discovered in the Corso Cotugno necropolis in November 1833. The date of its construction is uncertain, dates ranging from the end of the fifth century BC to the mid-fourth century BC have been proposed. In any case, the tomb's frescoes are the oldest example of figurative painting in Apulia, together with another tomb in Gravina di Puglia. The Peucetians borrowed the practice of painting tombs from the Etruscans, who had an important influence on their culture. The tomb is named after the dancing women which appear on the frescoes in the tomb. The panels with the frescoes are now exhibited in the Naples National Archaeological Museum, inv. 9353.  Description  The tomb has a semichamber design. Its six painted panels depict thirty or more dancing women, moving from left to right with arms interlocked as though they were dancing a circle around the interior of the tomb. They are dressed in chitons and cloaks and have brightly colored veils on their head. There are three men in the group, distinguished by their white clothes. One of them holds a lyre. The skeletal remains of the deceased in the tomb clearly belonged to a distinguished male warrior. He was dressed in a helmet, greaves and shield. Next to his right arm were spears and daggers. The grave goods included different types of ceramic pottery. These consisted of kraters, amphorae, kantharoi and some oil lamps. They were arranged on the ground and hung from the lower sections of the walls. The pottery had symbolic and funerary significance.

Most of the inhabitants had previously been exposed to a whitewash derived from local soils containing tremolite asbestos. This caused an epidemic of malignant mesothelioma (MM) that reached an incidence 300 times that expected in populations not exposed to asbestos. This was accompanied by pleural calcifications (PCs) in almost half the adult population. Both conditions have declined significantly since the whitewash ceased to be used after 1985. Locally high rate of PCs In the early 1980s when the Medical School of Ioannina was established, a group of pneumonologists headed by S.H. Constantopoulos started encountering, almost on a daily basis, X-ray images with extensive PCs in inhabitants of Metsovo. The researchers were told that this was very common to Metsovites and was the result of old tuberculous pleurisy. However, since the picture was not even remotely similar to calcified pleurisy from previous tuberculosis, they began to investigate the precise frequency of PCs, whether their abnormal incidence was in fact confined to Metsovites, and their true cause. In a field study in Metsovo and other areas around Ioannina, it was confirmed that PCs were very common among Metsovites, around 50% of adult population, increasing to more than 80% in those above 70; and that they were seen only in Metsovo and three neighbouring villages.Constantopoulos SH, Goudevenos JA, Saratzis NA, Langer AE, Selikoff IJ, Moutsopoulos HM. Metsovo lung: pleural calcifications and restrictive lung function in north-western Greece; environmental exposure to mineral fiber as etiology. Environmental Research, 1985; 38(2): 319-331 Relation to asbestos The relation to asbestos was identified when, a few months later, two consecutive patients appeared with massive pleural effusions that proved to be malignant mesothelioma. These were only the first of a series of mesotheliomas; seven in five years (1981‚Äì1985). This rate is roughly 300-times that expected in a non-asbestos exposed community.Constantopoulos SH, Malamou- Mitsi V, Goudevenos JA, Papathanasiou MP, Pavlidis NA, Papadimitriou CS. High incidence of malignant pleural mesothelioma in neighbouring villages of Northwest Greece.

Regional findings in Metsovo lung. Lancet ii, 1987; 452-453 Source of asbestos The possibility of this exposure being occupational seemed very unlikely, as there are no asbestos mines or factories near Metsovo. The nearest such mine (active until 1990) is located near Kozani, a city 150 miles east of Metsovo.

An outbreak of pleural mesothelioma and chronic fibrosing pleurisy in the village of Karain/Urug in Anatolia. Thorax 1978; 33: 181-192 the researchers arranged a meeting with Metsovites where they were told that practically all households in Metsovo were using soil from nearby hills (white soil is louto in the local dialect) for whitewashing. The material was applied more often on walls around fireplaces, because this kept the walls white, unsoiled from the fire. This whitewash was used by everybody until 1940-1950 and gradually abandoned, so that in 1980 it was used by only 15% of the households and by 1985 it was completely abandoned.Constantopoulos SH, Saratzis NA, Goudevenos JA, Kontogiannis D, Karantanas A.

Chest, 1991; 99: 1158-61 Samples of the whitewash were sent to Mount Sinai Hospital, and proved to contain fibers of tremolite asbestos identical to the material previously obtained from the lungs of Metsovites. Louto was obtained by digging soil from hills 5‚Äì10 km from Metsovo within the \\"Pindos serpentine zone\\". It was shaped like a ball, crushed into powder, boiled and applied to the walls. Crushing the ball released more than 200 fibers/ml of air, when the accepted limits for occupational exposure are lower that one fiber/ml. There were minuscule fiber concentrations during the rest of the process, while no fibers were detected in the ambient atmosphere of Metsovo. There has never been any commercial use of the soil within the Pindos serpentine zone other than that mentioned (the asbestos mine in Kozani was functioning until the early 1990s), but there have been several areas where soil had been used by small populations in the remote past for various domestic uses, as in Metsovo. In at least two of them there have been small \\"epidemics\\" of mesothelioma. The use of this soil has been abandoned for at least 50‚Äì60 years. Outside Greece and Turkey, similar use with similar results has been reported in other areas around the Mediterranean Sea, but also as far as New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.Constantopoulos SH.

First, other sources of asbestos exposure, after the abandonment of louto, had to be excluded. Two clinical means of measuring exposure were used for this purpose. Both had been positive in practically all exposed Metsovites during the peak of louto use: chest computed tomography (CT) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).Constantopoulos SH, Dalavanga YA, Sakellariou K, Goudevenos J, Kotoulas OB.

It is found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and was first described by the Danish naturalist Otto Friedrich M√ºller in 1776. Description Bolinopsis infundibulum is an oblong comb jelly growing to a maximum length of about . The thin gelatinous body wall is transparent, or occasionally milky white. There are two short tentacles with fringed edges. The mouth is at one end of the body and has two large lobes beside it, used to funnel food towards it. Between the lobes are four auricles, gelatinous projections fringed with cilia, that produce feeding currents that help draw in the microscopic prey. The mouth is surrounded by a ring of tentilla (little tentacles). The other end of the body is bluntly pointed. Locomotion is provided by the four long longitudinal rows and four short rows of cilia. These cilia are arranged on transverse plates and beat in synchrony, giving the animal its iridescent appearance. The plates to which the cilia are attached are bioluminescent. Distribution Bolinopsis infundibulum occurs in the northern Atlantic, its range extending from the Arctic to the Mediterranean Sea in the east and the Gulf of Maine in the west. It also occurs in the Pacific Northwest from the Bering Sea to California. It is found to a depth of about , with the largest individuals found at greater depths. Ecology Bolinopsis infundibulum is a predator and sometimes occurs in swarms. The food is drawn towards the mouth by the feeding current created by movement of cilia. Weakly swimming prey such as fish eggs and fry, copepod larvae, gastropod veligers, rotifers and other tiny zooplankton are then trapped by the tentilla and ingested. Bolinopsis infundibulum is an important part of the food chain, occurring in large numbers off the coast of Norway from April to August, and in Scotland from April to June. As many as 250 individuals per square metre have been recorded in mid-May, followed by a rapid decline. This sudden population collapse is believed to be caused by predation by another species of comb jelly, Beroe cucumis. Larger individuals of B. infundibulum have been reported from deeper waters, preying on copepods, later in the year.

History In July 2014, Chancellor of the Exchequer of the United Kingdom, George Osborne, announced while on a visit to India that a statue of Mahatma Gandhi would be placed in Parliament Square, Westminster. He said that \\"I hope this new memorial will be a lasting and fitting tribute to his memory in Britain, and a permanent monument to our friendship with India.\\" It was announced at the same time that sculptor Philip Jackson had been asked to create the statue. He had previously created the statue of the Queen Mother, the RAF Bomber Command Memorial, and the statue of Bobby Moore. Planning permission was granted by Westminster City Council later that year in November. The statue in the workshop before it was installed in Parliament Square Financing for the statue was by public donations and through sponsorships. This was supported by the work of the Gandhi Statue Memorial Trust, which was set up by Meghnad Desai, Baron Desai, as well as a special advisory panel created by the Government. This was chaired by Sajid Javid MP, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. By the time that planning permission, ¬£100,000 had been raised by the Trust, but a further ¬£500,000 was needed and they sought to raise that by January 2015 in order to tie in with a planned visit to London by Prime Minister, Narendra Modi of India. The statue was unveiled by the Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on 14 March 2015. It was dedicated as a commemoration of the centenary of Gandhi's return to India from South Africa, which is generally regarded as the commencement of his efforts for Indian independence. Speakers at the unveiling of the statue included Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Cameron, the Indian film actor Amitabh Bachchan and Gandhi's grandson Gopalkrishna Gandhi. In June 2020, during the George Floyd protests, the statue was vandalised by protesters along with the statue of Winston Churchill. Someone painted the word \\"racist\\" onto the Gandhi statue. Design Detail of the statue The statue is tall, and made from bronze. It is based on a photograph of Gandhi standing outside the offices of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald in 1931. The plinth that the statue is mounted on is lower than those on the other statues in Parliament Square, which was a deliberate choice by the Gandhi Statue Memorial Trust. It was planned to be the final statue to be placed in Parliament Square. Because of the placement of the statue of Gandhi, developers are expecting to move the placement for a planned statue of former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, to outside of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in Middlesex Guildhall. On its unveiling, commentators noted the irony of the statue's placement near the statue of Sir Winston Churchill that also stands in Parliament Square. Churchill, who strongly opposed Indian independence, famously once called Gandhi \\"a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well known in the East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal palace\\". The Telegraph of Kolkata noted that the fact \\"that Gandhi and Mandela now stand alongside a slew of white men in Parliament Square is proof of how much England itself has moved away from Winston Churchill's views on racism and imperialism.\\" See also * List of artistic depictions of Mahatma Gandhi References External links * Gandhi Statue Memorial Trust Category:2015 establishments in England Category:2015 sculptures Category:Monuments and memorials in London Category:Outdoor sculptures in London Category:Parliament Square Category:Sculptures by Philip Jackson Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi London, Parliament Square Category:Vandalized works of art in the United Kingdom ","title":"Statue of Mahatma Gandhi, Parliament Square"},{"id":"45677062","text":"Kuntur Wayi or Kuntur Wayin (Quechua kuntur condor, Ancash Quechua wayi house, \\"condor house\\", also spelled Condorhuayi, Condor-Huain) is a mountain in the Wallanka mountain range in the Andes of Peru.

It was built in the late 18th century. History There was probably a church in Longnor in the 12th century, since the font in the present church is of that period; the earliest mention of a church here was in 1448. It is thought it stood in what is now the churchyard, which was formerly a large space used for markets and fairs.A P Baggs, M F Cleverdon, D A Johnston and N J Tringham, 'Alstonefield: Longnor', in A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 7, Leek and the Moorlands, ed. C R J Currie and M W Greenslade (London, 1996), pp. 41-49 British History Online, accessed 11 March 2015. The present church was built about 1781; the earlier building was demolished and the new church was built on a site to the north. It is of coursed ashlar; it has a rectangular nave, with no separate chancel, with five rounded-headed windows on each side; there is a west tower. In 1812 the walls were raised to allow a south gallery (which was later removed) and a west gallery; an upper arcade of windows, of similar shape to those below, was added. There is an external staircase leading to the west gallery. In 1852 an organ was installed in the south gallery, and later was placed on the south side of the chancel. In 1948‚Äì49 a false ceiling was installed, so the upper windows can be seen only from the outside.St Bartholomew, Longnor, Staffordshire The Corpus of Romanesque Sculpture in Britain and Ireland, accessed 11 March 2015. The font, the only survival from an early church, was in the churchyard in 1830, when the archdeacon ordered that it be put inside the church. It is in the west end of the nave, under the gallery. It is chalice-shaped, carved from a single block of gritstone; there is incised decoration of a face and shields.

The case involved police who had been legally issued a search warrant relating to a drug bust but executed the warrant at the wrong address. Despite knowing the address was incorrect, the police continued to search the property. The family of the person who had been wrongfully searched sued the Crown arguing breaches of section 21 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, which protects against unreasonable search and seizure. Previously, no case had awarded damages for breaches of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act and there was no mention of damages in the legislation itself. The Crown argued that they had immunity from prosecution or alternatively that if they did not have immunity, the plaintiffs were not entitled to any remedy other than a declaration of non- compliance with the Bill of Rights. The Court of Appeal felt that a mere declaration would be \\"toothless\\" and subsequently awarded damages. The decision is significant for multiple reasons. It allows plaintiffs to initiate a cause of action for breaches of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, a previously unavailable remedy. Where a plaintiff has an existing cause of action but feels the remedy is insufficient, they are also able to sue under this ground additionally. The case was criticised as representing an example of judicial activism, and that Parliament did not intend to offer financial compensation for breaches of the act. This was particularly true because in New Zealand, the act is not entrenched nor does it achieve the status of \\"Supreme Law\\" like similar nations have in their constitutions. However, following the decision, the Law Commission advised Parliament not to overrule the decision, and Parliament has since followed this advice. Background Detective Murray Robert Drummond was advised by an informant that a Troy O'Brien was involved in the use and sale of cannabis at his residence of 16 Main Road, Korokoro, Lower Hutt. While he was preparing his application for a search warrant, he discovered that there was no \\"Main street\\" in Korokoro. Further inquiries suggested the address was either 16 London Street, or 16 Korokoro Road. The detective then asked the local power company about whether Troy O'Brien was the account holder for either, and the power company erroneously informed the police that Troy O'Brien was the account holder for both addresses. For unknown reasons, the detective then filed for a search warrant for only 16 London Street, which later turned out to be the address of Elisabeth Simpson, and not Troy O'Brien as intended. On 18 October 1991, the police arrived at the London Street address to execute the search warrant. Upon arrival in the street, the police told any suspicious neighbours to \\"mind their own business\\", but then later relented and asked the neighbours whether Baigent lived at this address, and were not only told that Troy O'Brien did not reside at this address, but that the address they were looking for was 16 Korokoro Road. The search warrant continued, and they talked to Baigent's son, who informed them they had the wrong address, and even showed them his passport to prove his identity. When this had no effect, he got his sister on the telephone, who was a solicitor. She spoke to the police there, told them she was an officer of the High Court, and advised them that they had the wrong address. The police replied \\"We often get the wrong (address), but while we are here we will have a look around anyway\\", and the police proceeded with the search, despite clearly having doubts of the address being incorrect. Baigent claimed this was an unreasonable search, which is illegal under section 21 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act (1990), and sued the Attorney General (on behalf of the police). The police argued that the search was backed by a court issued search warrant, and that even if the search was a breach of the Bill of Rights Act, the Act made no reference to the entitlement of damages, adding that the police had immunity for damages under section 6(5) of the Crown Proceedings Act [1956] anyway. At first instance, the AG managed to have Baigent's claim struck out. Decision In Attorney General v Chapman, in a 3 to 2 decision, the Supreme Court restricted the application of damages to only acts done by the executive or legislative branches, thereby excluding damages for breaches by the judiciary.

Design and development In the 1930s there was some interest in aircraft designs with automatic gust stabilization, one example being the Italian Jona J-6. In 1938 Francois Rey and M. Ruoanet took out a patent on another stabilization method in which the wings could hinge near their roots along a line oblique to the span. This meant that when a tip dropped the wing hinged upwards, increasing its angle of attack and hence its lift, restoring the aircraft to level flight. An aircraft with this feature was built but destroyed during World War II. After the war Rey built a two-seat, twin engine light aircraft to test the principle of the patent. Its low cantilever wing was tapered to rounded tips and had aspect ratio of 10 and noticeable dihedral. Renault 6Q six cylinder air-cooled inverted inline engines were mounted on the wing undersides in deep long cowlings. The rubber disc sprung hinges began immediately outboard of the rear engine cowling on the wing trailing edge and ran forward and outward to the leading edge at about 45¬∞ to the chord. Black sealing strip shows their position in photographs. The R.1's long ailerons were mounted outboard of the hinge, starting close to the hinge connection with the trailing edge. The rest of the R.1 was completely conventional with an oval fuselage, single seat enclosed cockpit and a second seat behind in a windowed cabin. The tailplane was straight edged and tapered with strong dihedral and carried twin vertical tails, oval in profile, at its extreme tips. It had a tailwheel undercarriage with the main wheels in spats on short faired vertical legs from the engine cowlings. Two R.1s were built, numbered 01 and 02. 01 flew for the first time on 12 December 1949 and 02, which had enlarged fins, on 3 July 1951. 01 was exhibited in flight at the Le Bourget F√™te in 1951, where it exhibited its flexing wings and braking parachute.

Airey was also known as a poet and as a short story writer, publishing a number of pieces in various periodicals from 1888. Early life Airey was born at Barrow-in Furness, Lancashire, in 1865 to Peter Airey and his wife Mary (n√©e Akrigg). After his mother died, he travelled to Maryborough, Queensland with his father and brother in 1875. Three years later he was a pupil-teacher at Bundaberg North before being appointed an assistant teacher at Maryborough in 1883.Airey, Peter (1865‚Äì1950) ‚Äì Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 15 March 2015. Airey then taught at several schools across southern and central Queensland including Bundamba, Rockhampton, Mount Morgan, Charters Towers, and Brisbane. He became president of the East Moreton Teachers' Association and led his colleagues in publicly demanding substantial salary increases. In February 1901, Airey was sent to Hughenden as head-teacher, allegedly as punishment for his demands. Political career Representing the Labour Party, Airey was elected unopposed for the seat of Flinders. He was soon Whip and secretary of the parliamentary Labour Party and in 1903 he was elected the party leader and president of the central political executive. Appointed Secretary for Mines & Public Works for nine days in 1904, Airey was then made Home Secretary, and remained in this role till July 1907. Having left the Labour party for the \\"Kidstonites\\", he was defeated at the 1907 Queensland state election by John May but was almost immediately appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council, remaining there for six months until he resigned to successfully contest the seat of Brisbane South at the extraordinary 1908 Queensland state election. Airey was made Treasurer in February 1908 but was dropped from cabinet in October 1908 and, losing his seat in 1909, he retired from state politics. He was a member of the Cleveland Shire Council in 1924‚Äì27 and then quit politics altogether. Writing career Airey was a very prolific poet writing under the pen-names \\"P. Luftig\\", \\"Philander Flam\\" and \\"Furness Born\\" as well as his own, although no collection of his works has been published to date. The Bulletin described his verse in 1904 as \\"a task entered upon as doggedly and conscientiously as the correction of school exercises and with as little poetic inspiration\\", but admitted occasional flights of something better. Personal life Airey married Martha Watts Lintern in 1897 and together had 9 children. He retired to Birkdale and died there in 1950.

At least 15 people were killed and seventy were wounded in the attacks. The attack was followed by mob violence killing two men mistaken as militants. It was the second attack on Christians minority after the deadliest attack in 2013 on All Saints church in Peshawar. In August 2015, Punjab home minister Shuja Khanzada announced that five members of the Tehreek-e-Taliban were arrested in connection to the attack. According to the statement, the men received monetary and material support from India and planned the attack in Afghanistan, from where they came to Lahore. The arrested men also confessed to planning further attacks in Karachi and Lahore. Background The Pakistani Taliban operates as an umbrella organization for various Islamist militant groups in Pakistan. They actively target religious minorities for attacks, including a series of attacks in 2002.

One of the Islamist militant groups allied to the Pakistani Taliban is Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a breakaway organisation that reunited in March 2015. Jamaat-ul-Ahrar carried out the November 2014 Wagah border attack where over 60 people died and over 100 were injured, and the same month killed at least six people in Mohmand Agency and attacked the membership camp of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement party in Karachi. Jamaat-ul-Ahrar operate the Afia Siddiqui Brigade, named after Aafia Siddiqui, which previously carried out 2012 attacks on a police van on the Peshawar Ring Road and on the Judicial Complex in Peshawar. Attack According to reports, two suicide bombers attacked the churches located in a Christian locality. The bombings took place during weekly Christian service at the two churches of Yuhanabad neighbourhood located at a distance of half a kilometre apart. The bombers targeted two churches, Saint John Catholic Church and Christ Church at around 11:00 am local time. Both churches are located in the Youhanabad area, which is one of the country's biggest Christian localities and is home to least one million people. The bombers tried to enter the churches but were stopped at the gate by the guards, where they blew themselves up. The high number of casualties was due to the fact that weekly service was underway when the attacks occurred. The wounded were rushed to the General Hospital, where a state of emergency was declared at 12:21 pm. The explosions caused a stampede at the Church as worshipers ran to save their lives. Windowpanes were broken due to the explosions.

Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan spokesperson Ehsanullah Ehsan used his Afghan mobile number to contact the media in Pakistan. He said, \\"We have carried out the attack. We have reached Lahore, the center of Punjab province, which is a challenge and a warning to the rulers.\\" He said that the group of suicide bombers who carried out the attack belonged to the Aafia Siddiqui Brigade. In August 2015, Punjab home minister Shuja Khanzada announced that five people were arrested in connection with the attack. According to Khanzada, they belonged to the TTP's Shehryar Mehsud group and planned the attacks inside Afghanistan, from where they came to Lahore. According to the statement, the arrested suspects received monetary and material support from India. They also confessed to planning more attacks in Karachi and Lahore. Aftermath The attacks ignited protests which continued for the next three days. During the most violent of these protests two men were lynched on the same day as the attacks. The next day paramilitary personnel had to be deployed in order to maintain law and order. The victims were laid to rest on 17 March amid tight security and several thousand police and rangers personnel were deployed in Lahore during the last rites. Politicians, religious leaders and members of the civil society condemned the attacks, while calling for stricter security measures. However, the lynching by the mob was also condemned and Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan termed it as \\"the worst kind of terrorism\\". The second leg of the FIFA World Cup qualifier match between Pakistan and Yemen was to be played in Lahore. FIFA first gave the go- ahead for the match saying that it could be played behind closed doors but later a statement issued by the governing body cited \\"safety and security reasons\\" for the postponement of the match and said that the Asian Zone first round second leg tie will be played in a neutral venue. A subsequent statement by FIFA said that the match will played in Manama, Bahrain. Protests After the attack up to 4,000 Christians gathered at the attack site, formed a mob and blocked Ferozepur road. The angry mob attacked a nearby Metro bus station. Water cannons were dispatched to help police clear the area. However, the mob took three policemen hostage and refused to talk with Ports and Shipping Minister Kamran Michael, who had arrived to console them. The mob captured and lynched two men suspected of being involved in the attacks. The Christian community in Faisalabad city also protested against the attacks. Members of the Christian community in Karachi took to the streets and protested at Esa Nagri area. They blocked the route from Hassan Square to Liaquatabad area of the city. Similar protests were staged in Multan, Gujranwala, Sialkot and other cities of Pakistan. The next day up to 5,000 Christians gathered to protest but protests again turned violent as two people were killed and at least six were injured when a van ran over the protesters. Lynching The angry mob lynched two persons. One of the lynched men was identified as Muhammad Naeem by his brother Muhammad Saleem who filed an FIR of a murder case against the protesters. He claimed that his brother was innocent and further stated that his brother was not a militant. He was missing and when they went to hospital they came to know that he was one of those lynched. He said his brother was a glasscutter and they owned a glass shop and his brother had gone there for their work. The second victim was identified as Babar Noman, a garment worker who had come from Sargodha in search of employment at a factory. The police buried the victim's body on 17 March but a court ordered the exhumation of the body once the victim's family lodged a complaint. However, the authorities stated that the body would not be handed over before a DNA test is used to prove his identity. Reaction Domestic reaction =Government= A spokesman for the Punjab province government condemned the attacks and said authorities are reinforcing security at the 481 remaining churches across the city. The Chief Minister of Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif condemned the attacks and commented that killing someone on the basis of suspicion is inhumane. No one has the right to take the law into their hands. The Balochistan Provincial assembly condemned the suicide attacks and lynching of two men by an angry Christian mob. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif also condemned the attack. Interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan condemned terrorist attacks on churches and said those who had done this did not belong to any religion because no religion tolerates such odious crimes. He also said that action would be taken against those who burnt two people alive and damaged public and private properties. =Religious groups= The Catholic Church of Pakistan strongly condemned the suicide bombings and urged all Pakistanis to stand with their fellow Christians against extremists. Pakistan Catholic Bishops' Conference urged the nation's provincial and federal governments to take effective measures to provide security for the churches of Pakistan, so as to guarantee freedom of religion and worship. The church also appealed to the Christian community to avoid violence and co-operate with the police in their investigations. The Catholic bishops said that they prayed to their Lord for the health of the injured and to grant grace to the families who lost their loved ones. Muslim scholars hailing from different schools of thought condemned the attack and termed it un-Islamic. Muftis of Sunni Ittehad Council said that Islam did not permit attacks on the worship places of religious minorities. A Muslim state was responsible for the protection of minorities. They also urged Islamic scholars to define the rights of minorities in Islam. Pakistan Ulema Council leader Tahir Ashrafi said, \\"It seems like a conspiracy to ignite communal violence in the country. I appeal to all Pakistanis to stand united against this act of terrorism.\\" Jamaat Ahle Hadith Pakistan and Milli Majlis Shari also condemned the attack and urged the religious scholars to play their role against terrorism. International reaction * Vatican ‚Äì Pope Francis said, \\"It's with pain, much pain that I was told of the terrorist attacks against two Christian churches in Lahore in Pakistan, which have caused numerous deaths and injuries. These are Christian churches and Christians are persecuted, our Christian brothers are spilling their blood simply because they are Christians. I implore God ... that this persecution against Christians ‚Äì that the world seeks to hide ‚Äì comes to an end and that there is peace.\\" * ‚Äì Jen Psaki said, \\"We strongly condemn Sunday's attack on innocent people at two churches in Lahore, and we extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of the victims. The United States stands in solidarity with the people and government of Pakistan. We support the right of every person to practise religion without fear of intimidation, death, coercion or any form of reprisal. This is a basic human right both in Pakistan and throughout the world.\\" * ‚Äì UN Deputy Spokesman Farhan Haq read out a statement of the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon wherein he said \\"The secretary general notes with grave concern that the Pakistani Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attacks while threatening to carry out more such acts in the future. He (the UN chief) calls on the Government of Pakistan to swiftly bring the perpetrators to justice and to do its utmost to prevent attacks against places of worship and protect religious minorities. The secretary-general extends his heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and to the government and people of Pakistan.\\" * ‚Äì The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement: \\"We strongly condemn this atrocious attack that targets the stability and peace of Pakistan, and we wish God's mercy on those who lost their lives, convey our sympathies to their families and wish for speedy recovery of the wounded.\\" * ‚Äì The Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning the attacks and said: \\"The dastardly act against a religious congregation engaged in the practice and sustenance of their faith and spiritual upliftment is not only an attack against a group and places of worship but against humanity and the civilized world. Sri Lanka as a country which has suffered from the scourge of terrorism for more than 30 years shares the grief and pain of the people of Pakistan at this moment of distress.\\" * ‚Äì The Chinese Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks and their spokesman Hong Lei said: \\"We are deeply shocked and in a state of grief over the attack and condemn the terrorists in the strongest terms. China extends heartfelt condolences to the victims and expresses deep sympathy to the wounded and the families of the victims.\\" See also *Terrorist incidents in Pakistan in 2015 References Category:2015 in Punjab, Pakistan Category:2015 murders in Pakistan Church bombings Category:21st-century mass murder in Pakistan Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in 2015 Church bombings Category:Attacks on churches in Asia Category:Attacks on religious buildings and structures in Pakistan Church bombings Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2015 Category:Jamaat-ul-Ahrar attacks Category:March 2015 crimes in Asia Category:Mass murder in 2015 Church bombings Category:Massacres in religious buildings and structures Category:Persecution of Christians in Pakistan Category:Suicide bombings in 2015 Church Category:Terrorist incidents in Pakistan in 2015 Category:Building bombings in Pakistan Category:Church bombings by Islamists ","title":"Lahore church bombings"},{"id":"45677293","text":"Media regulation in the Republic of Singapore is carried out by the Info- communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) and effected by various laws. Films and videos History Over the years, Singapore has gradually moved away from film censorship to film classification. This means that the Board of Film Censors (BFC) now classifies content into age- appropriate ratings. Classification allows films to be suitably rated for different audiences so the public can have greater access to a wider range of media choices without compromising on the need to protect young children from undesirable content. The importing, making, distributing or exhibiting of films in Singapore is governed by the Films Act of 1981.http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi- bin/cgi_legdisp.pl?actno=1998-REVED-107&date;=20060115&method;=whole&doctitle;= =Prior to 1991= Film censorship started out strict before the gradual introduction of an official film classification system. As a result, many films were either simply censored to be approved for commercial screening or banned in the past. Films like A Clockwork Orange (1971), Last Tango in Paris (1972), The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Saint Jack (1979) were previously banned. In the late 1980s, The Accused (1988) had a five-minute gang rape scene cut, while the fake orgasm sequence in When Harry Met Sally... (1989) was excised. =1991 to 1998= The first attempt at classification ratings started in 1991 which included the now defunct \\"R18\\" and \\"R(A)\\" ratings to allow mature audiences to watch such films containing more graphic sexual content and the presence of nudity. The focus of these early content ratings was mainly on sex/nudity content in non-pornographic films in the beginning of Singapore's film classification attempts and thus, other objectionable content such as graphic violence and coarse language were able to slide pass the censors and be accepted under a mere \\"PG\\" rating. To prevent the release of further softcore sexploitative films that managed to somehow get by the censors when the film classification system began, The \\"R18\\" rating was later revised in the same year to the more stringent \\"R(A)\\" or \\"Restricted (Artistic)\\" rating and the age limit was raised from 18 to 21. *R18: Movies that has sex/nudity, graphic violence and coarse language or other mature content, and meant for 18 and above. A sizable amount of softcore pornography, especially from Hong Kong, entered the market and were released uncut under this rating. Public backlash soon followed. *R(A): Several months after public backlash, R18 was replaced by \\"Restricted (Artistic)\\", which signaled only non-pornographic material would be accessed, and is meant for 21 and above. =1998 to 2004= In 1993, an \\"NC16\\" rating was introduced for films that lacked adult content such as sex and nudity scenes but was still deemed thematically unsuitable for children such as strong graphic violence in a war setting which exceeded the then \\"PG\\" guidelines. However, the \\"NC16\\" rating was only used five years later in 1998 with the release of the graphic war drama, Saving Private Ryan (1998). Back then, violent content in movies released in Singapore were not held to the same standards as sexual content which enabled \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" to get a lower age-restricted film rating than the \\"R(A)\\" rating despite containing multiple scenes of strong graphic war violence. Content standards informally changed in the next few years when brief scenes of sexually related or non-sexually related upper body female frontal nudity/breast nudity and moderate sexual scenes without nudity or other details were gradually allowed under the \\"NC16\\" rating with films like \\"Gosford Park\\" (2001) while other films such as \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning\\" (2003) and \\"Kill Bill Vol 1\\" (2003) received an \\"R(A)\\" rating solely for graphic violent content for the first time. =2004 onwards= In 2004, film classification became more organised and consumer advisories for titles were added. An \\"M18\\" rating was added to provide more choices for young adults and the \\"R(A)\\" rating was done away. Violent content in films started to be held to a stricter standard, which resulted in Saving Private Ryan (1998) being re-rated \\"M18\\" for its prolonged and intense sequences of graphic war violence under the new classification guidelines. Another example was Gladiator (2000), which would be rated \\"NC16\\" under the new guidelines instead of its previous \\"PG\\" rating. On the other hand, standards for sexual content in films was being liberalised. Many titles that were previously rated \\"R(A)\\" for graphic sex scenes/nudity were re-rated \\"M18\\". American Beauty (1999), Lost in Translation (film) (2003) and Shakespeare in Love (1998) were some examples. Titles that still exceeded the guidelines for an \\"M18\\" rating were re-rated under \\"R21\\", another rating introduced in 2004 which was the maximum age limit for films. Some films that received the \\"R21\\" rating were Basic Instinct (1992) and Kill Bill Volume 1 (2003). Home video classification for films up to an \\"M18\\" rating was also introduced in the same year. Before 2004, some age-restricted shows were unfairly edited to meet the then 'PG\\" classification guidelines to release it as \\"PG\\" rated shows for theatrical release by distributors. Such examples included Starship Troopers (1997), Enemy at the Gates (2001) and The Green Mile (1999). They were also edited or disallowed for home video releases as only \\"G\\" and \\"PG\\" rated titles were allowed on home videos previously. A \\"PG13\\" rating was later added in July 2011 on the recommendation of the Censorship Review Committee for titles that were deemed unsuitable for young children but not strong enough to warrant an \\"NC16\\" rating. Today, the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) utilises a proper and consistent system of age-appropriate film classification, assigning films different ratings for different groups of audiences. They also released the official set of film classification guidelines to the public online in 2010, which included a thorough explanation of what sort of content and themes is allowed under each film rating. The latest classification system as of 2011 consists of the following: Age- Advisory ratings These three ratings have no restriction in ages. * G (general) ‚Äì suitable for all ages. (This classification was introduced in 1991) * PG (parental guidance) ‚Äì suitable for most but parents should guide their young. May contain moderate violence without details, mild horror, brief rear nudity, infrequent moderate coarse language (e.g. \\"asshole\\", \\"bastard\\" etc.), discreet drug references, mild displays of affection (i.e. kissing and caressing) and mild sex references/innuendos. (This classification was introduced in 1991) * PG13 (parental guidance 13) ‚Äì suitable for persons aged 13 and above but parental guidance is advised for children below 13. Recommended by the CRC in 2009, the PG13 rating is given to films with content deemed unsuitable for young children but for which a NC16 rating is not warranted. May contain moderate violence with some details and some infliction of pain and injury, moderate gore, some mature themes, more intense and realistic horror, moderate sexual references, sexual innuendoes, sexual imagery, crude hand gestures, sexual humour, rear nudity, side profile nudity, discreet drug use/references, frequent moderate coarse language and infrequent usages of the word \\"fuck\\". (This classification was introduced in 2011) Age-Restricted ratings In cinemas, these ratings are age-restricted. * NC16 (no children below 16) ‚Äì no children below 16 years of age. May contain brief scenes of sexually related or non-sexually related upper body female frontal nudity/breast nudity, moderate sexual activity without nudity or other details, moderate sexual violence, strong sex references, brief same-sex kissing scenes, some homosexual references, graphic violence portraying infliction of pain and injuries with some details of blood and gore, frightening scenes which are more prolonged with disturbing gory images/scenes without strong details, mature themes including (religious themes, homosexual themes and political themes), brief scenes of drug use and strong coarse language (e.g. \\"motherfucker\\", \\"cocksucker\\" etc.). (This classification was introduced in 1993) * M18 (mature 18) ‚Äì for persons 18 years and above. May contain full frontal nudity with moderate detail (sexual & non-sexual context), sexual activity which may feature some details (such as infrequent views of bare breasts) but without stronger details, frequent strong coarse language, drug use with some details, stronger portrayal and exploration of mature themes including (religious themes, homosexual themes/homosexuality as a sub-plot and political themes), implied homosexual activity, occasional displays of affection (i.e. kissing and caressing) between persons of the same gender and prolonged and/or intense sequences that invoke fear and/or terror. (This classification was introduced in 2004) * R21 (restricted 21) ‚Äì restricted to persons aged 21 and above. May contain frequent full frontal nudity with strong details (close ups of male/female genitalia) in sexual and non-sexual context, graphic but simulated sexual activity with strong details and could be prolonged/frequent, strong sexual violence, explicit portrayal and exploration of mature themes such as those involving deviant sexual activities (e.g. sadomasochism, bondage, orgies or sex involving violence) or strong homosexual themes including same-sex marriage/parenting as a main theme, homosexual activity with some details, pervasive strong coarse language, strong and realistic depictions of graphic violence and gore, depiction of graphic torture if it is not deemed excessive, hard drug use sequences with strong details and depictions of sustained graphic horror with strong details. (This classification was introduced in 2004). Movies that are classified as R21 are currently excluded from home video releases and suburban theatres. However, as recommended by the latest CRC in September 2010, R21 video-on-demand (VOD) is now allowed on pay TV services. In July 2016, the MDA officially greenlit R21-rated content for Over-the-Top (OTT) services. Refused classification In exceptional cases, a film may be refused classification when the content of the film has been deemed to undermine national interest or erode the moral fabric of society. This includes themes that promote issues that denigrate any race or religion, language that denigrates religion or is religiously profane (example: Jesus [expletive] Christ), depiction of real sexual activities/unsimulated sex (e.g. actual penetration, actual ejaculation, actual oral sex, actual masturbation), themes that glorify undesirable and unnatural sexual activities (e.g. bestiality, paedophilia, etc.), content deemed to be exploitative or obscene in nature such as actual pornographic footage containing real sex acts, fetishes or practices which are offensive or abhorrent, explicit promotion and normalisation of homosexual lifestyle, explicit homosexual scenes, materials glorifying and encouraging drug and substance abuse, detailed and instructive depiction of illegal drug use, detailed or gratuitous depictions of extreme violence or cruelty and detailed instructions on methods of crime or killings. Refused classification material was formerly denoted with the NAR rating. Examples of movies given several controversies Movies with \\"strong homosexual themes\\" are typically given R21 ratings regardless of other content in the film. The American films Milk, a 2008 biopic starring Sean Penn as gay rights activist Harvey Milk, and Brokeback Mountain, a 2005 romantic drama about two homosexual cowboys played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, both received R21 rating for depictions of homosexual sexual activities. However, the 2018 film Love, Simon about a gay teenager coming to terms with his identity and finding out which of his classmates is his anonymous online pen pal was given an R21 classification despite having no depictions of sexual activity, because MDA determined that \\"the theme of homosexuality... forms the main narrative of the film.\\" Oftentimes, this film classification system compels film distributors to create an alternate, cleaner version of the film to qualify for less restrictive ratings and suburban theatrical screenings for commercial reasons. For example, in 2007, distributor Focus Features released Lust, Caution (2007) in two versions: an edited NC16-rated version that was nine minutes shorter and another that was R21-rated and uncut. At the same time, the MDA allows for \\"some leeway during classification\\" for films with \\"limited screenings\\". For instance, in 2012, Cathay-Keris Films was told that Shame (2011) would receive an R21 rating for commercial release in mainstream cinemas only if a scene featuring group sex was edited. However, when the film was re-submitted for classification for the Singapore Film Society screening in 2013, the MDA gave it an R21 rating without edits. Some local films have also encounted censorship difficulties with the MDA. In 2003, filmmaker Royston Tan's gangster-themed \\"15\\" (2003) suffered numerous cuts pertaining to national security concerns. In 2007, filmmaker Loo Zihan's homosexual-themed Solos (2007) was subjected to edits involving three scenes of graphic gay sex to meet R21 classification guidelines. In June 2012, the MDA revoked the M18 classification of Singaporean director Ken Kwek's Sex.Violence.FamilyValues (2012) and banned the film a day after its premiere after receiving complaints from Indians who alleged that the \\"Porn Masala\\" section of the film contained scenes which were offensive to Singapore's Indian community. The film's director and producers submitted an appeal to Singapore's government-appointed Films Appeal Committee, asking for the ban to be lifted. In January 2013, the Films Appeal Committee overturned the Board of Film Censors' decision and lifted the ban, giving it an R21 rating subject to edits by the filmmaker to a scene which contained particularly racially offensive dialogue.\\"Banned Film Gets New Life in Singapore\\". The Wall Street Journal. (15 January 2013). The film The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) had to have an orgy and threesome scene, as well as religiously profane language edited to secure an R21 rating. Likewise, the French film Blue Is the Warmest Colour (2013) had to have an explicit and prolonged lesbian sex scene sequence considerably edited down to secure the R21 rating. The film Black Swan (2010) was passed with an M18 rating, but only after a mandatory cut was made for a graphic lesbian scene. In 2011, the Oscar-nominated drama The Kids Are All Right (2010) was given an R21 rating with the condition of a one-print theatrical release as the film was deemed to be \\"explicit in its portrayal of a lesbian family as a normal and acceptable lifestyle\\" which had exceeded the MDA's Films Classification Guidelines. The restriction served as a signal that the film had gone beyond community values in Singapore. In September 2014, Singaporean filmmaker Tan Pin Pin's documentary about Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) political exiles, To Singapore, With Love (2013), received an NAR rating, with the MDA claiming that it undermined national security as \\"the individuals in the film have given distorted and untruthful accounts of how they came to leave Singapore and remain outside Singapore,\\" and that \\"a number of these self-professed 'exiles' were members of, or had provided support to, the proscribed CPM.\\" The Yangtze Cinema, built in 1976, was probably the only theatre in Singapore where uncut softcore pornographic films were shown, it has closed its doors on 29 February 2016. Party political films The controversial Section 33 of the Films Act originally banned the making, distribution and exhibition of \\"party political films\\", at pain of a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years. The Act further defined a \\"party political film\\" as any film or video : (a) which is an advertisement made by or on behalf of any political party in Singapore or any body whose objects relate wholly or mainly to politics in Singapore, or any branch of such party or body; or : (b) which is made by any person and directed towards any political end in Singapore Exceptions are, however, made for films \\"made solely for the purpose of reporting of current events\\", or informing or educating persons on the procedures and polling times of elections or referendums. In 2001, the short documentary called A Vision of Persistence on opposition politician J. B. Jeyaretnam was also banned for being a \\"party political film\\". The makers of the documentary, all lecturers at the Ngee Ann Polytechnic, later submitted written apologies and withdrew the documentary from being screened at the 2001 Singapore International Film Festival in April, having been told they could be charged in court. Another short documentary called Singapore Rebel by Martyn See, which documented Singapore Democratic Party leader Dr Chee Soon Juan's acts of civil disobedience, was banned from the 2005 Singapore International Film Festival on the same grounds and See is being investigated for possible violations of the Films Act. Channel NewsAsia's five-part documentary series on Singapore's PAP ministers in 2005 were not considered a party political film. The government response was that the programme was part of current affairs and thus does not contravene the Films Act . Since they do not concern the politics of Singapore, films that call out political beliefs of other countries, for example Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911, are allowed. Since March 2009, the Films Act has been amended to allow party political films as long as they were deemed factual and objective by a consultative committee. Some months later, this committee lifted the ban on Singapore Rebel. Print media  Local press With the sole exception of MediaCorp's daily freesheet Today, all daily newspapers including the flagship Straits Times are printed by Singapore Press Holdings, whose management shareholders are appointed by the government in accordance with the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act of 1974. While current shareholding structure does not imply direct governmental control on media content, their active presence promotes self-censorship amongst journalists. In 2008, Reporters without Borders ranked Singapore as 144th out of 173 surveyed countries in terms of freedom of the press. The Singapore Government said it is not ashamed of its low rank for press freedom because it has achieved top ratings for economic freedom and prosperity. Instead of subscribing to the Western press model, it believes that a non-adversarial press can report accurately and objectively. A recent Gallup poll found that 69% of Singaporeans trusted their media. On 30 June 2006, blogger mrbrown wrote an article, titled \\"TODAY: S'poreans are fed, up with progress!\\", for his weekly opinion column in Today newspaper concerning the rising income gap and costs of living in Singapore. Three days later, on 3 July, an official from the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts published a response letter on the same newspaper calling mrbrown a \\"partisan player\\" whose views \\"distort the truth\\". On 6 July, the newspaper suspended his column.Daily newspaper Today sacks blogger \\"mr brown\\" after government criticism , Reporters Without Borders, 6 July 2006 Fellow blogger Mr Miyagi subsequently resigned from his column for Today. This was followed by Today newspaper chief executive and editor-in-chief Mano Sabnani's resignation in November 2006. The action fuelled anger over the Internet due to the perceived heavy-handedness action taken by the government over criticisms.\\"Mixing welfare and elitism in Singapore\\", Alex Au, Asia Times Online, 23 November 2006 Foreign publications The MDA requires importers to \\"ensure that the publications/ audio materials brought in for distribution do not feature content which could be considered objectionable on moral, racial or religious grounds, or deemed detrimental to Singapore's national interests\\". According to the MDA, more than 2 million publications and 300,000 audio materials are imported into Singapore each year under the Registered Importers Scheme. Foreign publications that carry articles the government considers slanderous, including The Economist and the Far Eastern Economic Review (FEER), have been subjected to defamation suits and/or had their circulations \\"gazetted\\" (restricted). The sale of Malaysian newspapers in Singapore is prohibited;Newspaper and Printing Presses Act, Sec. 22. \\"Permit required for sale and distribution in Singapore of newspapers printed or published in Malaysia\\" 22\\\\. ‚Äî(1) No newspaper printed in Malaysia shall be published, sold, offered for sale or distributed in Singapore unless the proprietor of the newspaper or his agent has previously obtained and there is in force a permit granted by the Minister authorising the publication, sale or distribution of the newspaper in Singapore, which permit the Minister may in his discretion grant, refuse or revoke, or grant subject to conditions to be endorsed thereon. a similar ban on the sale of newspapers from Singapore applies in Malaysia. In August 2006, the government announced a tightening of rules on foreign publications previously exempt from the media code. Newsweek, Time, the Financial Times, the Far Eastern Economic Review and the International Herald Tribune will be required to appoint a publisher's representative in Singapore who could be sued, and to pay a security deposit of S$200,000. The move comes after FEER published an interview with Singaporean opposition leader Chee Soon Juan, who claimed that leading members of the Singaporean government had \\"skeletons in their closets\\". On 28 September 2006, FEER was banned briefly for failing to comply with conditions imposed under the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act. Pornography is strictly prohibited in Singapore; this encompasses magazines such as Playboy or Penthouse. However, magazines which are deemed non-pornographic and classified under \\"Adult Interest Magazines\\" such as Cosmopolitan are free to be distributed at all stores with a \\"Unsuitable For The Young\\" label on its cover. In December 2008, a Singaporean couple was charged with sedition for distributing the Chick tracts The Little Bride and Who Is Allah?, said \\"to promote feelings of ill- will and hostility between Christians and Muslims in Singapore\\". Television Singapore's state investment arm, Temasek Holdings, is the parent organisation of MediaCorp which comprises all free-to-air terrestrial local TV channels licensed to broadcast in Singapore, as well as 13 radio stations. In July 2011, Singapore relaxed the Subscription Television Programme Code guidelines allowing Pay TV operators to screen up to M18-rated content programmes containing more graphic content (e.g. sex scenes/nudity, graphic violence, strong language) and mature or sensitive subject matter relating to political issues, racial/religious issues and homosexuality. R21-rated content was still restricted to only Pay TV Video-on-Demand (VOD) services. In July 2016, the IMDA officially greenlit R21-rated content for Over-the-Top (OTT) services. However, the English language Pay-TV channels currently available for scheduled broadcast in Singapore comprises only Asian regional channels such as Fox Channel Asia, Star World and WarnerTV, which are outside the editorial control of the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) as they operate on a regional scale and the same standard of censorship is carried out across the entire region because these channels have to conform with laws from the more conservative areas in Asia, meaning most territories in Asia watch the same censored version. At the moment, only Singapore-owned Video-On-Demand services offer English language programmes that can be regulated by the IMDA and therefore, passed uncut under classification ratings such as NC16, M18 and R21. The popular HBO series Sex and the City was pulled from broadcast originally in the late 90s when the series debuted but the ban was later lifted after an earlier relaxation of guidelines in the Subscription Television Programme Code in 2004. Private ownership of satellite dishes is illegal, though international TV news broadcasts (such as CNN International, BBC World News, Fox News Channel, RT, etc.) are available on services such as Starhub TV and SingTel IPTV Singtel TV. The Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA), through its four Programme Advisory Committees (PAC) for each of the four official languages, monitors and provides feedback on broadcast content. Permissible content on free-to-air Singaporean TV is regulated by the IMDA's Free-to-Air Television Programme Code. The Free-to-Air Television Programme Code states that \\"all programmes broadcast between 6am and 10pm must be generally acceptable for family audiences. The transition from family-oriented to more adult programming after the watershed time of 10pm should also be executed gradually\\" Hence, locally produced dramas aired before 10pm tend to be more family-based, with crime-horror-thrillers; etc. at a minimum. PG13 content, which is allowed only after 10pm to 6am, is the maximum rating available for free-to-air television in Singapore. NC16 and M18-rated content are available only on Pay TV channels under the editorial control of the IMDA such as Singapore channels E City and VV Drama, both of which owned by Starhub. Part 13.3 of the Code states that use of the local English-based creole Singlish \\"should not be encouraged and can only be permitted in interviews, where the interviewee speaks only Singlish.\\" The popular Singlish sitcom Phua Chu Kang was singled out in a National Day rally speech. The Programmes Advisory Committee for English TV and Radio Programmes also singled out the use of Singlish in local sitcoms in its 2005 annual report, saying they \\"contain excessive Singlish\\" and \\"this should be avoided as it could give the wrong impression, especially among the young, that Singlish is the standard of spoken English in Singapore\\" Part 13.4 of the Code states that \\"All Chinese programmes, except operas or other programmes specifically approved by the Authority, must be generally in Mandarin.\\" Dialects in dialogues and songs may be allowed provided the context justifies usage and is sparingly used. More leeway of dialects is given for Pay TV channels. In February 2008, the Academy Awards acceptance speech for the short documentary Freeheld was censored by Mediacorp in the rebroadcast of the program due to the filmmakers' mention of equal rights for same-sex couples as it violated the Free-to-air TV Programme Code. Another aspect is the dialects ban which is currently in practice for free-to-air radio and television, which is also criticized in the Speak Mandarin Campaign, Languages of Singapore or in Broadcasting in Singapore. 2009 RWB press freedom rankings Freedom of press Singapore is rated at 154 of 178 on the Press Freedom Index and as \\"not free\\" on the Freedom of the Press report. MediaCorp, owned by state investment arm Temasek Holdings, with 7 television channels and 14 radio channels, is by far the largest media provider and the only television broadcaster. Singapore Press Holdings has a monopoly over the print media. This, combined with the Media Development Authority's ability to regulate all media, led the press to adapt a non- adversarial approach to reporting instead of facing defamation lawsuits. Overseas media has faced warnings, defamation suits, and contempt of court proceedings filed by Singaporean officials in the local courts, including the International Herald Tribune, Economist, Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and the Far Eastern Economic Review. Journalists and human rights groups have commented that the apologies were made to preserve the distribution system and editorial access of their media in the Singaporean market. In 2014, a new regulatory framework for online news websites came into effect. Online content providers must apply for a licence if they: # report an average of at least one article per week on Singapore news and current affairs over a period of two months, and # are visited by at least 50,000 unique IP addresses from Singapore each month over the same period of two months These sites must also put up a performance bond of $50,000, and individual licenses have to be renewed on a yearly basis. Registered sites are expected to remove content that is in breach of MDA standards within 24 hours, if their content is considered by IMDA as being against the public interest, public security, or national harmony. The move was widely seen as a way of tightening control over non-traditional news reporting and socio-political websites before the 2015 general elections. Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act, (POFMA) and known colloquially as Fake News Law, is a statute of the Parliament of Singapore that enables authorities to tackle the spread of fake news or false information. The law is designed specifically to allow authorities to respond to fake news or false information through a graduated process of enforcing links to fact-checking statements, censorship of website or assets on social media platforms, and criminal charges. The law is controversial and has received criticism both locally and internationally by opposition politicians, human rights groups, journalists and academics, and is thought to further add on to the stringent laws in Singapore.

The series ran on CBS Radio from 1949‚Äì1952. The series was sponsored by Chesterfield cigarettes and was usually recorded in Hollywood or San Francisco. Notable guest stars and appearances on the series included Peggy Lee, Ella Fitzgerald, Al Jolson, Bob Hope, Mary Martin, The Andrews Sisters, The Bell Sisters and The John Scott Trotter Orchestra. Show origins Singer and entertainer Bing Crosby had finished a three-year engagement with Philco and ABC on Philco Radio Time which had ended in June 1949. Crosby then returned to CBS where Chesterfield cigarettes picked up the sponsorship tab for his show. The show was named The Bing Crosby Show for Chesterfield and premiered on September 21, 1949. Overview Following his three-year stint with Philco which had concluded in the previous June, Bing Crosby's first programme with his new sponsors was broadcast on the 21st September 1949. The decade which was drawing to a close had consolidated Crosby's position as the world's most popular singer and in comparison to periods of a similar duration, was his most productive in terms of feature films, records, radio time and personal appearances. Only in retrospect can the massive transformation that overtook the entertainment business, in the Fifties, be appreciated. The ailing cinema still believed it could find its salvation in gimmicks and dabbled with wide screens, stereophonic sound and 3D. In 1954, the advent of rock and roll was to provide the most astonishing and far-reaching changes that had ever taken place in the field of popular music. Radio was running out of sponsors and the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù money was backing television. The public infatuation with the medium became absolute and advertisers were swift to recognise the obvious advantage to be gained from visual presentation of their products. Liggett & Myers, manufacturers of Chesterfield cigarettes, were no exception, keeping a foot firmly placed in both camps. In addition to Bing Crosby, they had also acquired the services of Perry Como and Arthur Godfrey and were later to add, if only briefly, Bob Hope and Martin & Lewis. Season one With Chesterfield cigarettes on board as Crosby's new sponsor after his stint with Philco on ABC Radio's Philco Radio Time, Bing returned to his original home on radio, CBS. The network premiered The Bing Crosby Show for Chesterfield on Wednesday September 21, 1949 at 9:30 pm (Eastern) which was the time slot that series would remain in for its entire three-year run. Billboard liked the opening show. \\"Bing‚Äôs back and all‚Äôs right with the airwaves. Sparked by the crooner‚Äôs mellow mike manners and a showmanly assist from guest stars Peggy Lee and Abe Burrows, the preem show sailed along effortlessly in the warm, relaxed groove so characteristic of the groaner.\\" During the season the audience share was 18.0 which put the singer in ninth place overall for evening programmes. The top position was held by the Jack Benny show with a rating of 25.3. The ratings were now being collected by the AC Nielsen company which used the audiometer, a mechanical black box inserted into a radio set to record stations being listened. In March 1950, a survey came out with \\"the greatest radio personalities during the last 25 years\\". The survey named Crosby the number 2 personality behind Jack Benny. Entertainer Bob Hope and comedic duo Amos 'n' Andy were tied for the number 3 spot. Season two This season of the program was known for its list of guest stars, including Bob Hope, Dorothy Kirsten, Burl Ives, Dick Powell, Ella Fitzgerald, Hopalong Cassidy, Louis Armstrong, Fred Astaire, The Andrews Sisters, Dinah Shore and Nat King Cole. The December 20, 1950 broadcast of the program featured Crosby's then wife Dixie Lee and their four boys Gary, Dennis, Phillip and Lindsay. Variety summed up the opening show on October 11, 1950 saying, \\"If Crosby can keep banging it in, in the weeks to come as he did on the tee-off, it‚Äôs going to take some doing by the others to keep him out of the first ten.\\" However the audience share for the season was only 10.0 and the show did not figure in the top 20 ratings as assessed by Nielsen. The top radio show for the season was the Lux Radio Theatre with a rating of only 21.0 reflecting the increasing impact of television. The second season of the program was also noted for resurrecting the career of actress Judy Garland. Judy's drug addiction and unreliability had led Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to release her from her contract there in September 1950. Depressed and broke, and having recently attempted suicide, Judy was invited to become a semi-regular on the program, appearing eight times during the season, until she secured a concert engagement at the London Palladium in April 1951. =\\"Bing's Month\\"= CBS and Paramount Pictures declared the month of January 1951 \\"Bing's Month\\" in honor of Crosby's 20th year as a solo artist in show business. Art Linkletter hosted a half-hour tribute to Crosby over CBS radio on January 9. On January 7, the Liberty Broadcasting System from its Los Angeles affiliate KMPC broadcast an hour-long tribute to Crosby hosted by Ross Mulholland and featuring interviews with Paul Whiteman, Tommy Dorsey, Russ Morgan, Jane Wyman, The Andrews Sisters, Johnny Burke, Jerry Lewis, Victor Young, Frank Capra and others. Season three The opening show was on October 3, 1951 and Variety welcomed it with \\"Bing Crosby is probably one of the most affable performers in radio. Year in and year out, he‚Äôs held a commanding position on the air by virtue of warm, easy verbiage and a song style that‚Äôs made him the number one pop-singer. His return to the airways after a summer hiatus indicates that Crosby will maintain his audiences.\\" Unfortunately, Variety were wrong and this season of the program would prove to be the last as Chesterfield decided to drop the show. Radio audiences were falling because of the impact of television and Chesterfield cigarettes decided to use their advertising budget on the new medium. The show did not reach the top 20 Nielsen ratings and the most highly rated radio show for the season was the Amos ‚Äòn‚Äô Andy program with 17.0. The series ended on June 25, 1952. Sponsorship for Crosby moved from Chesterfield to General Electric and in the fall of 1952, The Bing Crosby Show for General Electric premiered.

The enclosure church is dedicated to Saint Nonne and her son Divy and was built between 1588 and 1714. It has a 1618 south porch with statues of the apostles inside as well as a statue of Christ giving a blessing and holding a globe in his left hand. Apart from the church there is a chapel, small ossuary and a calvary. The church contains some superb altarpieces and sabli√®res. The church is a listed historical monument since 1916. Eglise Sainte-Nonne et Saint-Divy The name Dirinon is derived from the Breton \\"diri\\" which means an oak (ch√™nes) and Sainte Nonne. The chapel of Saint Nonne Dating to 1577, this chapel was built around the tomb of Saint Nonne (the gisant and its decoration is attributed to the Atelier du Folgo√´t) which is dated to 1450. It is a rectangular building with a small domed bell tower. The gisant marking the tomb depicts the saint laying full length with a book in her hands. Her head rests on a cushion held by two angels and at her feet is a dragon. The base of the tomb is decorated with six panels with reliefs depicting the twelve apostles and the coats of arms of those who funded the construction of the tomb and chapel. especially Simon de Kerbringal, although most of the reliefs were chiseled away during the French revolution. The decoration of the chapel is completed by statues of Saint Nonne, Saint Anne, Saint Catherine, Saint Fiacre, Saint Divi and Saint Helen. The chapel currently serves as a museum. There is a small statue of Saint Nonne in a niche over the chapel entrance door. There is also a stained glass window dedicated to Saint Nonne in the church . File:105 Dirinon.JPGThe gisant of Saint Nonne. The tomb is located in the middle of the nave and is 2.30 metres long. Note the dragon at her feet and the panels depicting the apostles around the base. Saint Nonne's feet point eastwards to the altar.

The South Porch This dates to 1618 according to an inscription on the statue of the \\"Holy Father\\". Much later this statue was used for the depiction of the \\"Holy Father\\" which formed part of the \\"Trinit√©\\" altarpiece. Inside the porch are some sabli√®res and statues of the apostles.

The calvary The 15th-century calvary is a modest one by Breton standards and is thought to be the oldest part of the enclosure. It stands to the north-east of the Sainte-Nonne chapel and, therefore, south-east of the church, the traditional place for a calvary to be located. In the calvary, Jesus has the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist on either side when viewed from the west, and on the eastern side are depictions of Saint Peter with his key and Mary Magdalene surrounding the Virgin Mary with child.

The double-galleried belfry is surmounted by a spire surrounded by four pinnacles. An old bell by Jacques Le Louarn dating to 1655 has survived. The spire is in what is known as the \\"l√©onard\\" style. The south- west buttress carries the date 1588. The bell tower was hit by lightning damaging the upper part, firstly in 1774 and then 1951, but the damage was repaired though the variation in brickwork does detract from the tower's overall appeal. The altarpieces alt= * The \\"Altar of the Holy Trinity\\" shown above is to be found in the south transept and has a beautiful altarpiece which includes a depiction of Saint Corentin and his fish. * The Altar of the \\"Rosary\\" is located in the north transept and the altarpiece includes 15 medallions depicting the life of the Virgin Mary. This altarpiece is the work of Pierre Fenestre. The altarpiece paintings are by Jean-Louis Nicolas. The chevet's stained glass window alt= The chevet's principal window dates to 1923 and is dedicated to Sainte Nonne. The two lancets in the left side of the window recall the welcome given by the local people to Sainte Nonne and her son Divy shown here being baptised, whilst the two lancets on the right side show the saint taking her son to a monastery where she is greeted by an abbot and two monks.

Behind them are \\"foule des √©lus\\" and the heads of several cherubs. There are further paintings in the vault of the transept. On the eastern side are depictions of the apostles and on the western side are depictions of the Doctors of the church. These were also restored by Nicolas. Sabli√®res and blochets The church has some magnificent sabli√®res and blochets. The sabli√®re is a horizontal wooden beam running along the top of a wall where it joins the roof.

The film is directed by Patrick Kong and starring original cast Julian Cheung, Charmaine Sheh and Nancy Sit. The film will continue the story where the drama left off. A short music trailer was released in February 2015 to overwhelming popularity. Julian Cheung sings the original theme song ‚ÄúWishing Kwan Well‚Äù (Á•ùÂêõÂ•Ω). The movie was released on November 12, 2015. Story Several years has past after the TV series. Man Cho (Julian Cheung) continues his life as a local errand boy, supplying people with food and items in the local streets of Macau. During this time, Man Cho meets a beautiful mute girl, Kei-Kei. The two share a romantic bond as both communicate through sign language and many thought the two will tie the knot until the unexpected return of his beloved step-sister, Kwan-Ho (Charmaine Sheh). Kwan-Ho returned to give her mother, Qi (Nancy Sit), a surprise visit before Man Cho escort Kwan-Ho to her hotel room. The two smile at each other and Kwan-Ho mentions how great it was to see him again. Unknown to everyone, Kwan-Ho just lost everything in her life. Kwan-Ho suspected her husband, Szto Lai-Sun (Steven Ma), of having an affair. After the couple argued, Lai-Sun thought it would be best to take a drive with the kids to calm their minds, but that's when they had an auto accident and killing everyone in the car. In an instant, Kwan-Ho lost everything and also blamed herself for the tragedy. She returned to Macau in part to see her friends and family one last time before she attempted suicide. It wasn't long when the entire family finally got word from the in- laws and Man-Cho found Kwan-Ho unconscious. She had slit her wrists and tried to bleed out in the hotel tub; Man-Cho immediately took her to the emergency room for treatment and she survived. However, the doctor warned Kwan-Ho's loved ones that she's dangerously suicidal and will likely attempt suicide again without a watchful eye upon her. For several days, the family would take exhaustive turns watching over Kwan-Ho. Man-Cho would burn a fair amount of his money to entertain Kwan-Ho as she gambled everything away. Despite watching over her, she still attempted suicide via drug overdose. Man Cho attempt to change her mind by challenging her to do a bungee base jump off Macau Tower. Despite his intense fear of heights, he did it in attempts to cheer her up and it partially worked as he peed in his own pants while falling down. Throughout this time though, Kei-Kei would experience doubt and confusion. She thought she had Man-Cho, but ever-since the return of Kwan-Ho, she has been sidelined and has been frustrated over the situation. As time past, Kwan-Ho would find a reason to live again and resumed the old life she had with her family. One fateful night, a major rain storm happened. Man Cho asked Kwan-Ho to help pick up Kei-Kei from a bus station, but an unexpected landslide happened and buried Kwan-Ho within. Perfectly covered within the mud, no one would know Kwan-Ho was trapped inside except for Kei-Kei. Wrought with anger and jealousy of Kwan-Ho's hold over Man Cho, she pretended nothing happened and Man Cho came to pick her up. However, as they drove away, Kei- Kei's conscience changed her mind and she told Man Cho what happened to Kwan- Ho; he rushed out to dig her out and rescued her. After Kwan-Ho was confirmed alive and well by the doctors, Man Cho had a chat with Kei-Kei. She realized she never had Man-Cho's heart and the two parted ways. Some time would pass and Man Cho has been suffering from occasional blurred vision. He has been keeping the matter to himself to his family to avoid their worries. Man Cho has been suffering from a growing blood clot after hitting his head from saving Kwan-Ho from that landslide. The family eventually finds out after he faints in front of everyone. The family doctor warned him he needs neuro surgery soon or he'll die. However, there's a major risk, there's a chance he'll suffer permanent memory loss. The family agrees to the risk as not taking the surgery will mean certain death. Upon their final moments before surgery, Man Cho declares to Kwan-Ho that they'll be together this time, no matter what. After the surgery, Man Cho wakes up to tell Kwan-Ho that everything is fine. To Kwan-Ho's happiness, he didn't lose his memory, however, the truth is unknown. Man Cho wrote a note for himself to recite to Kwan-Ho when he awakens, suggesting he lost his memory, but he wanted to calm her worries even if it means a delayed inevitability. The story would have an open ending, unsure of the fate of Man-Cho and Kwan-Ho.

Among the featured productions were works by Tony Morphett, Pat Flower, and John Warwick. Background Development In August 1965 Talbot Duckmanton of the ABC announced that the ABC would increase its production of local drama, including a show called Australian Playhouse. This would not necessary consist of Australian plays and be \\"of an experimental nature\\". The series was the idea of producer David Goddard, father of Liza. Goddard worked on the show for nine months before it aired. He says he knew of a TV station which claimed it was going to so a TV series and asked for scripts, then claimed the scripts were not of standard; Goddard says the station never put on staff, and actually had no intention of making the show. \\"It was making a political gesture by saying it was trying to do something. It is absolutely scandalous that this sort of thing should have been going on here. And this is where the idea has been built up that there are no writers in Australia. As we shall prove, this is absolute rubbish.\\" Goddard said \\"There's a wealth of untouched and untapped gold in the Australian short story writer. The Australian is gifted with the ability to tell a story.\\" He said the show \\"will all be written by Australians and produced in Australa. And because they are written by Australians and aimed at television audiences primarily in Australia, they will reflect, comment on, or observe in a fictional way life in this country, as those writers see fit, know it, or have experienced it. In a word, it will be Australian drama.\\" Season One In January 1966 Goddard announced that the ABC would made 39 episodes of 30 minutes each called Australian Playhouse. They would do 14 weeks \\"in all moods\\", then 12 \\"equally Australian dramas on a central theme\\", then 13 more. This would be in addition to the ABC's monthly dramas, and a comedy series. (The comedy series would be Nice and Jucy and Marcellus Jones. Series one ran from April 1966Article on first show The Age to early November 1966. In April 1966 Neil Hutchinson said \\"most of us have heard or read claims that Australia lacks good writers but I think you will agree this series disproves the claims.\\" According to Frank Roberts of The Bulletin, writing in May, the series \\"has to be viewed as a promising nursery\\". It is estimated eight to nine productions were written and filmed but not broadcast due to concerns about quality. In June 1966 The Sydney Morning Herald wrote the series demonstrated that there was a lack of creative talent in the country, particularly of writing. At the end of 1966 the Age TV critic felt the majority of plays did not deserve to appear on air. Val Marshall of the Sydney Morning Herald, reviewing the season for the year, said \\"what came up didn't always justify the timeslot. Roughly 10 percent were excellent (with the biggest score of winners going to Pat Flower). Another 40 percent was fair average quality. The other half can be written off as good tries. Was the Playhouse series justified? In my view yes.\\" It won a 1967 Logie for Contribution to the Industry.1967 Logie Award Winnershttps://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&dat;=19670608&id;=WNRYAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=Y5MDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5641,1309134&hl;=en Goddard said \\"We have plenty of scripts and the future of Playhouse appears good. If there were to be any changes for next year it would only be a change in the time spot - perhaps later in the evening. We have some brilliant plays but they are only suitable for adult viewing.\\" In December 1966 the ABC reported it spent a million dollars on Australian drama since 1956. It said it produced 358 plays, 187 of which were written by Australians. Australian Playhouse cost a reported $55,000 for 37 plays. The season was later described as 50% drama, 25% comedy, 25% fantasy. Season 2 The budget tripled for the second series. However it ran for a shorter time. The series started on June 12, 1967 in Melbourne and then broadcast in Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia and then New South Wales on 24 July. By June all the episodes had been filmed and work had started on the 1968 season. Pat Alexander, executive producer, said over 1,000 scripts had been submitted. \\"The result has been much better material,\\" said Alexander. Only two scripts were by writers from the previous season. Fifty percent of the plays were comedies, forty percent drama, and ten percent fantasy of experimental. (Another breakdown had it as 40% drama, 33% comedy, 27% comedy fantasy.) The Sydney Morning Herald called it \\"an inconsistent thing but our own\\". A Sunday issue of the same paper called the second series \\"the biggest flop\\" of the year.

Silversmith Work Sciarrotta Silver Gravy Boat and Ladle Sciarrotta's work is characterized by a sleek and simple style, and many of his smaller pieces feature his signature leaf-shape designs. During the 1950s and 1960s, Sciarrotta‚Äôs handmade silver serving dishes, bowls, candelabra, vases, trays, cigarette boxes, etc. were sold at the most exclusive American retailers from coast to coast, including Georg Jensen, Cartier, and Black Starr and Gorham in New York City; Bailey Banks & Biddle in Philadelphia; Gump‚Äôs in San Francisco; Shreve, Crump & Low in Boston; and many more. His designs became known as ‚ÄúThe Wedding Gift of Philadelphia and Newport‚Äù and he was often referred to as the \\"Modern Cellini;\\" this was also the title used for his brochure, which was given to retailers and collectors and included in gift packages. Sciarrotta Silver Coffee Set Sciarrotta's work was commissioned for gifts presented by the City of Newport to visiting dignitaries, including President Eisenhower, the Italian President Giovanni Gronchi, fighter Rocky Marciano, and Mayor Delmas of Antibes, France in 1962. In 1958, a Sciarrotta bowl was commissioned as a gift to Ambassador of Israel to the United States Abba Eban, on the occasion of the Newport Rhode Island Jewish Community's Tercentenary, marking the 300th anniversary of the founding of the oldest Jewish congregation in the United States. The bowl was presented to Ambassador Eban by Colonel Milton E. Mitler at the Belcourt Palace in the presence of Governor Dennis Roberts. Also in 1962, a Sciarrotta bowl in the shape of the hull of a 12-meter yacht was presented to Sr. Frank Packer, skipper of the ‚ÄúGretel‚Äù, the America‚Äôs Cup challenger for Australia. His bowls were presented as trophies for horse races around the country. Several of his pieces are on display at the Kentucky Derby Museum at Churchill Downs. His work is currently displayed in the Newport Art Museum, and his former studio is now an art school run by the Museum. Life The son of a dry goods merchant, Sciarrotta studied mechanical engineering at Alessandro Volta School of Engineering in Naples, Italy and remained in Naples working at a munitions factory during the years before World War II. Sciarrotta came to the U.S. in 1943 to play a major role in a clandestine Office of Strategic Services (OSS) operation carried out at the U.S. Naval Torpedo Station in Newport, Rhode Island. As an engineer whose undersea weapons expertise was acquired in Naples, Italy under the scientist Carlo Colossi, who invented the first magnetic torpedo exploder for the Germans during World War II, Sciarrotta was a critical asset to the U.S Navy when Italy fell to the Allies. In order to protect the secret hardware for the Allied war effort, Sciarrotta and a team of scientists and engineers were smuggled out of Italy with weapon-related hardware and tools plus two small submarines and a torpedo that Sciarrotta knew had been sunk by the Germans in Naples Harbor. The result of the mission in Newport at the Naval Torpedo Station was the building of the first two-man submarine as well as exploding magnetic torpedo devices. The submarine and original devices brought from Italy were placed in the U.S. Naval Academy Museum. Sciarrotta led the project under the code name Robert West. Sciarrotta Trademark Upon completion of the mission, Sciarrotta was offered a government position to stay on at the Naval Torpedo Station. Instead he decided to follow his artistic interests and develop of his craft, creating art objects of copper, brass and eventually sterling silver, applying the same precision and skill to his patented designs as to his weaponry. He opened a shop in Newport and married his English teacher, a native Newporter named Margherita Russo, and raised three daughters. Sciarrotta died in Newport, Rhode Island, on May 28, 1985, after a battle with lung cancer. He was survived by three daughters, three grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.

The line in the greater Zurich area belongs to the Zurich S-Bahn network and is operated by route S15.  History  Construction of the line The first section of the Wehntal railway was opened between Oberglatt and Dielsdorf at 1 May 1865. It was operated by the B√ºlach-Regensberg-Bahn as a terminal branch line connecting to the main line B√ºlach-Z√ºrich Oerlikon of the same company. At January 1, 1877 the B√ºlach-Regensberg-Bahn got bought by the Swiss Northeastern Railway (NOB), which made the acquisition to fight a possible competition by the Swiss National Railway (SNB) by providing a shorter connection between Winterhtur and Baden. The extension of the Wehntal railway till Niederweningen was already planned at the time of the purchase by NOB, but was only realized 1891. During the construction work some bones of Mammoth were found in Niederweningen. The Niederweningen Dorf railway station became the new terminal station which was at that time called Niederweningen. The latest extension of the branch line was realized in 1938, where the line got extended by about one km to connect the agriculture machinery factory Bucher- Guyer to the Swiss railway network. With the opening of the extension the new terminal station was called Niederweningen, while the name of the old terminal station became Niederweningen Dorf.  Surb valley railway  A further extension of the railway line through the Surb valley was planned since the mid-19th century, but was never realized. With this extension called Surb railway line the Wehntalbahn would have been connected in D√∂ttingen to the Turgi‚ÄìKoblenz‚ÄìWaldshut railway line and would have had lost the status as a terminal branch line. The construction of the extension was decided 1916 by amending the Swiss federal law by paragraph SR 742.34, but the construction never started. When the amended paragraph was cancelled 1937, the government had to give in by adapting the Swiss wide ticket prices and fright fares in such a way, that all prices were evaluated if the extension would have been built. The calculation considering the virtual Surb valley railroad only ended somewhere in the seventies.  Electrification  After World War II the Wehntal railway was threatened to be closed due to spares traffic. Some test with railcars were not successful. After it was decided not to close the railway line it was electrified 1960 with 15 kV 16‚Öî Hz as the second to last railway line of the Swiss Federal Railways to be electrified. The last railway line to be electrified was the Cadenazzo‚ÄìLuino railway, which cross the Italian border. There the steam operation lasted only a few weeks longer than on the Wehntal railway line. Since 1990 the Wehntal railway is part of the Zurich S-Bahn. Until the end of 2015 it was operated by routes S5 and S55. Since then it has been operated by route S15.

This was a 20-minute show aimed at female listeners and was broadcast at 11:40 a.m. daily. Crosby and Clooney would tape the dialogue weeks in advance and songs from the substantial library built up with Buddy Cole and his Trio would be interpolated. The songs would usually feature the singers singing separate solos and often a duet. Songs were repeated on many occasions. Murdo MacKenzie served as the producer.

The play was also broadcast by the BBC and screened for West German television. It was one of the few original Australian TV dramas of the time. It was turned into a radio play in 1970.Radio play information at AustLit Mann then adapted it into a play Day of Glory. Plot In the 1830s, a white settler is speared in the Newastle district. An Aboriginal, Jacko, is charged with the crime. However Captain Alcot interrogates Jacko, becomes convinced of his innocence, and sends a despatch to Sydney saying he is going to release the man. That night a party is held in the officers' mess and, in a drunken stupor, Lt Ned Louden shoots Jacko in the back. Urged on by Nathaniel Carlton, the resident magistrate, Captain Alcot writes to Sydney to explain the situation. Louden is arrested and brought to Sydney for a trial. Thomas Morland, the acting attorney-general, is sent to Newcastle to investigate the murder. Captain Alcot wishes to keep on the good side of the land-hungry Carlton so they attempt to defend the drunken lieutenant who has shot a native. Neither believe the prisoner Jacko had anything to do with the murder of a white settler, since he was captured 60 miles away from the crime. So they bribe Sergeant Constantine, who arrested Jacko, into saying that the place of arrest was close to Newcastle.

It was written by Philip Grenville Mann, an Australian writer who was living in England. He got the idea for the play after reading historical records at Australia House in London; he read about the accidental shooting of an Aboriginal during the time of Governor Phillip and did further research. He wrote it originally under the title The Sergeant from Lone Pine. The play won equal first prize in the 1959 New South Wales Journalists' Club Award out of 250 entries. (The other winner was J.V. Warner's World Without End.) President of the Journalists' Club was Kenneth Slessor and the judges, representing each of the three Sydney television stations, were Brett Porter (ATN-7), Raymond Menmuir (ABN-2) and Peter Benardos (TCN-9). Menmuir says the moment he read it, he suggested the ABC buy it. \\"It's a darned fine play,\\" said Menmuir. \\"The scenes are short, the action moves swiftly and smoothy and it has a universality of appeal.\\" Mann returned to Australia in 1961 after six years in England and replaced Rex Rienits as the ABC's drama editor. He would later write the historical ABC drama series The Patriots. It was shot live at the ABC's studios in Sydney. Alistair Duncan was an English actor who had recently settled in Australia and had played Captain Bligh's secretary in Stormy Petrel. Sets and costumes were by Geoff Wedlock. Nine sets were constructed for the play, including gaols and courtrooms. Reception The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that \\"it is an admirable play, dealing searchingly with the impulses, compulsions and motives of a gallery of characters...The production... was quite gripping; the play itself, most notably in the courtroom scenes, showed how telling a medium TV can be... this play was one of the best the A.B.C. has done.\\" Val Marshall from the Sunday edition of the Herald said it \\"let me with that rather unsatisfactory feeling of a good piece of material well handled, but which could have been a great deal better than it was\\" saying that \\"it got first rate treatment from Raymond Menmuir\\" but felt 90 minutes was too long and Duncan was miscast.\\" 1961 BBC Version In May 1960 the BBC announced they would film the play, then known as The Sergeant of Lone Pine.

Fairchild starred or co-starred in more than a dozen notable film roles before her addictions to drugs and alcohol effectively ended her professional acting career. Life Fairchild was born June Edna Wilson on September 3, 1946, in Manhattan Beach, California. Her father was a musician who specialized in writing gospel songs and music. Fairchild was raised in Manhattan Beach and graduated in 1964 from Aviation High School in Redondo Beach. She attended El Camino College and acted the youthful role of Arthur in the College production of Shakespeare'sThe Life and Death of King John in April 1965. Gazzarri Dancer on Hollywood A Go-Go By mid-1965 Fairchild had been hired to become a member of the Gazzarri Dancers on the syndicated variety show Hollywood A Go-Go after being recruited by the show's executive producer Al Burton. She remained on the show until it ceased production, with the final episode broadcast in February 1966. During her time on the show, June Fairchild and fellow dancer Mimi Machu created the Statue dance, a fad dance in which the dancers adopt stationary poses for a measure or two before shifting to new poses. The dance was performed on a number of Hollywood A Go-Go shows, including the show broadcast on November 6, 1965 in which Tommy Sands performed his record \\"The Statue\\", a song about the dance. In show host Sam Riddle's introduction to that performance, Mimi and June are acknowledged as the originators of the Statue dance, which had already spread to some public dance venues. Years of success During the 1960s, Fairchild lived with her then-boyfriend, Danny Hutton, the lead singer of Three Dog Night for several years. Fairchild was credited with conceiving the band's name, Three Dog Night. In the late 1960s and 1970s Fairchild had a successful acting career. She co-starred in Head, which was a vehicle for The Monkees, in 1968; Drive, He Said, which was directed by Jack Nicholson, in 1971; Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, which starred Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges, in 1974; and the 1978 Cheech & Chong film, Up in Smoke, in which she appeared as a drug addict who snorts Ajax soap powder. Decline In her later life Fairchild lived on the streets of Skid Row, Los Angeles due to her addictions. In 2001, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times ran a story about Fairchild's past career in Hollywood and her present life on the streets of Los Angeles. Fairchild was selling newspapers outside a Los Angeles courthouse at the time in an attempt to earn enough money for a single-room occupancy hotel room. On February 21, 2001, the same day that her story was published in the Los Angeles Times, police stopped her in Van Nuys for carrying an open container. A police officer recognized her picture from the newspaper and arrested her for failure to complete her community service from a past drunk driving conviction. Fairchild was sentenced to 90 days. In 2002, Fairchild told the Los Angeles Times that her sentence had triggered a pledge of sobriety. Friends told reporters that Fairchild remained sober until her death in 2015. Fairchild spent the later years of her life living in single-room hotels in downtown Los Angeles using her Social Security disability payments. Death Fairchild died from liver cancer at a convalescent home in Los Angeles on February 17, 2015, at the age of 68. Fairchild had divorced twice.

Background G was raped by an employee of Auckland Hospital whilst she was a patient, and subsequently sued the hospital for damages for the rape. The hospital defended the claim saying that such a claim was barred under section 5 of the Accident Compensation Act 1972. G countered that the actions of the staff member were clearly deliberate, and so could not be referred to as an accident. Held The court ruled that the true test was to look at the event from the victim's view, not the other party's view. That being the case, the rape was an accident under the Act, making a damages claim barred under section 5. Footnote: The date that the offending occurred, 2 April 1974, was unfortunate as it was only 1 day after the Accident Compensation Act [1972] came into force.

It is recognized as a traditional Italian food product in the Prodotto agroalimentare tradizionale scheme of the Italian government. It is most associated with Sicily's capital Palermo, but it can be found all over the island.  Ingredients  The principal ingredients are olive oil, onions, pasta and a finely chopped mixture of sardines and anchovy. Various types of pasta are used for the dish, but bucatini is traditional. Wild fennel, saffron, pine nuts, raisins and salt are added to flavor the dish. To finish the dish it is topped with toasted breadcrumbs. Fresh sardines are preferable, but if these are not available canned sardines can be used. Wild fennel is plentiful in Sicily, but might be hard to find elsewhere; if unobtainable, the tops of ordinary fennel may be used instead. Some variations use tomato sauce. Cookbook author Pino Correnti argues that the tomato-less recipe published in 1886 by the folklorist Giuseppe Pitr√® is the only authentic version.

Description Veining occurs as 'vein' like projections from a casting, usually at right angles to the casting's surface; the phenonoma can occur in any alloy, and is commonly seen in ferrous or copper based castings. Veining has been attributed to temperature differences at distance from the molten metal resulting in differential thermal expansion in the sand leading to strain in, and failure of the sand mould. Research has shown that a main cause of veining is thermal expansion of the silica sand in combination with reduction in sand volume above 573C (after the alpha to beta silica phase transformation) due to softening/sintering and/or melting of sand grains, which results in cracking/voids. Veining can be reduced or avoided by the use of more refractory non-silica sands (zircon, chromite etc); by flux additives which lower the temperature of silica transition to tridymite or cristobalite, or which sinter the sand increasing resistance to failure; or by organic additives which are decomposed to carbon at high temperature, which then bonds to silica increasing strength, imparting veining resistance.

In his own words, Eug√®ne Farcot explained the origins of his idea during the 1867 Paris universal exposition (translated from the French): Each mystery clock of this one-of-a- kind series was individually made and therefore, no two are alike. They are distinguished for their artistic/horological excellence where foremost, award- winning people from various arts, crafts and sciences, created a masterpiece of Second Empire decorative arts. Besides a remarkable precision in timekeeping, one of their most distinctive characteristics is the slow continual circular motion at a constant speed (instead of the conventional side to side swinging motion) of the noiseless pendulum, tracing a conical trajectory in space, hence its name.  List of units  It is unknown the total number of units crafted, so far 13 have been found.

The largest conical pendulum clock  The piece at the Galerie d'I√©na, one of the main exhibition pavilions in the Palais du Champ- de-Mars at the Paris world fair of 1878. The artefact epitomizes the alliance between art and industry promoted back then and also the golden age of the conical pendulum clock (second half of the 19th century). Drawing depicting the grand vestibule of the Galerie d'I√©na, both the clock and ceiling height have been magnified. In 1878, the largest conical pendulum clock ever built was erected in the missing Palais du Champ-de-Mars on the occasion of the Paris Exposition universelle internationale. It was his ultimate contribution to the conical pendulum clock, a type of timepiece not invented by the Frenchman, but that he brought to a new level of sophistication and engineering. Not to mention that he also helped to its popularization offering affordable mantel models, some with a patent of invention. The mechanical marvel was reviewed in several publications, next are included three of them:  During the Siege of Paris  The Louis Blanc over the clouds.

Mr Wu is very active on criticising Chinese government and its foreign influence, he expressed his concerns about the impact on freedom in Australia and other democratic countries during many of his media interviews. He claims the Chinese Students and Scholars Association is directly controlled by Chinese embassies and Chinese government, and it sabotaged the freedom of academics in campuses of Western universities. In 2019, media revealed that Lebao was among one hundred or so dissidents, including Ai Weiwei, 14th Dalai Lama, and Liu Xiaobo, whose name and works are totally forbidden to print in China even for oversea publications. Wu Lebao suspected of leading the Chinese Jasmine Revolution with Ai Weiwei and was interrogated by the Public Security Bureau of the People's Republic of China. He was formally arrested on 14 July 2011, and detained in Bengbu's No. 2 Detention Center for 'inciting subversion of state power' over three months. He was bailed on 28 October 2011, but was forbidden to get in touch with other Chinese dissidents. As reported, he was tortured during the detention. He departed China after his bail was ceased in February 2013. After he arrived in Australia, he declared that he did not lead the Chinese Jasmine Revolution. He had then settled in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. In May 2015, Wu, as a Chinese refugee, participated in a signatory of an open letter with Gu Yi appealing that Chinese Government end its secrecy over the Tiananmen Square massacre and hold those responsible to account. Mr Wu took an interview with The Guardian, in the report, Wu was titled as ‚ÄúChina's lonely voice of dissent refuses to forget the victims of Tiananmen Square‚Äù. Wu told his story about his imprisonment in China, and his concern about the Chinese influence will impact the freedom of speech in Australia. In 2016, Lebao and his friends published an open letter on Change Org to support Wu Wei, a tutor from University of Sydney who burned his Chinese passport and then was attacked by Chinese students. In the letter, Lebao argued that ‚Äúthe burning of a Chinese passport is only Mr. Wu‚Äôs way of expressing political dissent.‚Äù It believes that Wu Wei ‚Äúis becoming a victim of the Chinese government‚Äôs increasingly intrusive attempts to curb voices of dissent among overseas Chinese.‚Äù Later in that year, Lebao took an interview with Woroni, the Newspaper of Australian National University, it showed he had started new studying in ANU then. Lebao is often harassed by Chinese students in ANU because of his political views and his refugee background. In September 2016, Lebao and his friend Alex Joske, who was a student journalist at ANU then, attended gala organised by Chinese student in their university. They were trailed to a bathroom by those Chinese Students and Scholars Association organisers. Lately in 2017, Lebao and Alex published an essay on Woroni, their University newspaper to expose the truth about Chinese Students and Scholars Association. They gave detail about the incident they experienced in the gala. In 2018, Mr Wu participated in the Global campus movement \\"No my president\\", which was initiated by a large number of oversea Chinese descent students showing their rejection to Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping. This movement spread to many western countries outside China, In Australian National University, Mr Wu posted many posts in multiple places. Lebao‚Äôs name and works were revealed on a blacklist for printing in China even for foreign publishers in February 2019. The list was obtained by The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald. It was given to Australian publishers to censor political issues which are rejected by the Chinese regime. The list banned over one hundred dissidents‚Äô related words from printing in China, Nobel Peace Prize Laureates, Liu Xiaobo, and the 14th Dalai Lama were included in the list. In his late interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, Lebao said: ‚ÄúChina has just got more and more aggressive; they cannot be satisfied by their censorship in China, they would like to expand it to western countries, especially Australia since we have a large Chinese population.‚Äù  References  Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese dissidents Category:Prisoners and detainees of the People's Republic of China Category:People from Bengbu Category:Australian people of Chinese descent ","title":"Wu Lebao"},{"id":"45678306","text":"Ptolemy's Geography (Harleian MS 7182) The Magnus Sinus or Sinus Magnus (Latin; , o M√©gas K√≥lpos), also anglicized as the was the form of the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea known to Greek, Roman, Arab, Persian, and Renaissance cartographers before the Age of Discovery. It was then briefly conflated with the Pacific Ocean before disappearing from maps. History The gulf and its major port of Cattigara had supposedly been reached by a 1st-century Greek trader named Alexander, who returned safely and left a periplus of his voyage. His account that Cattigara was \\"some days\\" sail from Zaba was taken by Marinus of Tyre to mean \\"numberless\\" days and by Ptolemy to mean \\"a few\\". Both Alexander and Marinus's works have been lost, but were claimed as authorities by Ptolemy in his Geography. Ptolemy (and presumably Marinus before him) followed Hipparchus in making the Indian Ocean a landlocked sea, placing Cattigara on its unknown eastern shoreline. The expanse formed between it and the Malay Peninsula (the \\"Golden Chersonese\\"), he called the Great Gulf. Ptolemy's Geography was translated into Arabic by a team of scholars including al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ in the 9th century during the reign of al-Ma øm≈´n. By that time, Arab merchants such as Soleiman had begun regular commerce with Tang China and, having passed through the Strait of Malacca en route, shown that the Indian Sea communicated with the open ocean. African traders similarly showed that the coastline did not turn sharply east south of Cape Prasum below Zanzibar as Ptolemy held. Al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´'s influential Book of the Description of the Earth, therefore, removed Ptolemy's unknown shores from the Indian Ocean. The robustly-described lands east of the Great Gulf, however, were retained as a phantom peninsula (now generally known as the Dragon's Tail). Just after 1295, Maximus Planudes restored Ptolemy's Greek text and maps at Chora Monastery in Constantinople (Istanbul). This was translated into Latin at Florence by Jacobus Angelus around 1406 and quickly spread the work's information and misinformation throughout Western Europe. The maps initially repeated Ptolemy's enclosed Indian Sea. Following word of Bartholomew Dias's circumnavigation of Africa, maps by Martellus and by Martin of Bohemia replaced this with a new form of the Dragon's Tail peninsula, including details from Marco Polo. As early as 1540, continuing exploration led Sebastian M√ºnster to conflate the Great Gulf with the Pacific Ocean west of the Americas, supposing that the 1st-century Alexander had crossed to a port in Peru and safely returned. The idea was repeated by Ortelius and others. (Some modern South American scholars have returned to the idea as recently as the 1990s, but there remains no substantial evidence to support the idea.) The Great Gulf was finally dispensed with in all its forms as more accurate accounts returned from both the East and West Indies. A detail from an 18th-century map showing the common identification of the Great Gulf with the Gulf of Thailand Details The details of the Great Gulf changed somewhat among its various forms, but the ancient and Renaissance Ptolemaic accounts had it bound on the west by the Golden Chersonese and on the north and east by the ports of the Sinae, chief among which was Cattigara. Medieval Islamic cartographers followed al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ in having a strait southeast of the gulf communicating with the Sea of Darkness. Believing the circumference of the Earth to follow Ptolemy's reduced figures or even smaller ones, cartographers during the early phases of the Age of Discovery expanded the Gulf to form the Pacific Ocean west of South America, considered to represent a southeastern peninsula of Asia. Modern reconstructions agree in naming the Golden Chersonese a form of the Malay Peninsula but differ in their considerations of how much of the South China Sea to include within Ptolemy's reckoning of the Great Gulf. Those following Alexander's route from Zaba on its northern shore to Cattigara to its southeast consider it to be no more than the Gulf of Thailand, with Cattigara located in the Funanese √ìc Eo ruins at Tho·∫°i S∆°n. Its Cottiaris River would then be a former course of the Mekong which once passed the site to enter the Gulf of Thailand. Others ignoring the route as garbled but taking Cattigara to be the major Han entrep√¥t of Longbian consider the Great Gulf to have been the Gulf of Tonkin, hypothesizing that the Gulf of Thailand (if present) was represented by the smaller inlet on the eastern shore of the Golden Chersonese. Its Cottiaris River would have been Vietnam's Red River. Panyu (Guangzhou) had been the major port of the Kingdom of Nanyue but identifications of Ptolemy's Cattigara with Han-era Nanhai, though common in the past, are credited little more than those placing it in Peru.

Fillion-Lahille has argued that the first book of the De Ira was inspired by the Stoic philosopher Chrysippus' (3rd-century BCE) treatise On Passions (Peri Path√¥n), whereas the second and third drew mainly from a later Stoic philosopher, Posidonius (1st-century BCE), who had also written a treatise On Passions and differed from Chrysippus in giving a bigger role to irrational aspects of the soul. However, more recent research has shown that this view of Posidonius' criticism of Chrysippus was mainly due to Galen's (our main witness for Posidonius' and Chrysippus' now lost works) systematic distorsion of their thinking, and that Posidonius' theory of emotions was actually substantially identical with that of Chrysippus. In consequence, although Seneca may have used both treatises by Chrysippus and Posidonius, his main inspiration is now thought to be chrysippean. Seneca may also have known works written by the Peripatetic philosopher Theophrastus, whom he takes as philosophical adversary in the first book. Parallels have also been suggested with the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus, who had also written a work On Anger. Dating The exact date of the writing of the work is unknown, apart from an earliest date (terminum post quem), deduced from repeated references by Seneca to the episodic anger of Caligula, who died 24 January 41 AD. Seneca refers to his brother by his native name, Novatus, rather than his adoptive one, Gallio, which he bore by 52/53 AD, suggesting the work may date from the mid 40s AD. Book III begins with its own introduction on the horrors of anger, and can be read on its own, which has led to suggestions that it was devised either as a later appendix to the work, or that it was a separate treatise in its own right. Title and contents Ira is defined as anger, wrath, rage, ire, passion, indignation - primarily, to be angry.Lewis & Short, Perseus Digital Library at Tufts University : Latin Word Study Tools - ira [Retrieved 2015-3-15] De Ira consists of three books. It is part of Seneca's series of Dialogi (dialogues).J Sellars - Stoicism (Routledge, 5 Dec 2014) [Retrieved 2015-3-16] The essay is addressed to Seneca's elder brother, Lucius Annaeus Novatus. The work‚Äôs first sentence reads: Although split into three books, De Ira is effectively divided into two parts. The first part (I-II.17) deals with theoretical questions, whereas the second part (II.18-III end) offers therapeutic advice. The first part begins with a preamble on the horrors of anger, followed by definitions of anger. It continues with questions such as whether anger is natural, whether it can be moderate, whether it is involuntary, and whether it can be erased altogether. The second part (Book II.18 onwards) begins with advice on how the avoidance of bad temper can be taught to both children and adults. This is followed by numerous snippets of advice on how anger can be forestalled or extinguished, and many anecdotes are given of examples to be imitated or avoided. The work concludes with a few tips on mollifying other people, followed by Seneca's summing-up. Themes De Ira is written within the context of Stoicism, which sought to guide people out of a life enslaved to the vices, to the freedom of a life characterised by virtue. This is achievable by the development of an understanding of how to control the passions (Greek: path√™), anger being classified as a passion, and to make these subject to reason.B.Inwood - Passions and Perceptions: Studies in Hellenistic Philosophy of Mind (p.165 & 166) (Cambridge University Press, 25 Mar 1993) [Retrieved 2015-3-15] As a Stoic, Seneca believed the relationship of the passions to reason are that the passions arise in a rational mind as a result of a mis-perceiving or misunderstanding of reality. A passion is a defective belief,R Bett - A Companion to Ancient Philosophy (John Wiley & Sons, 9 Feb 2009) [Retrieved 2015-3-15] they occur when the mind makes errors about the values of things. Seneca states that his therapy has two main aims: one is that we do not become angry (resisting anger), and the other is that we do no wrong when we are angry (restraining anger). Much of the advice is devoted to the first aim of preventing anger. Seneca does offer some practical advice on restraining anger (mostly in III.10-15) although after this he resumes his theme of preventing anger. For the Stoics anger was contrary to human nature, and vengeance considered an evil, which explains Seneca's emphasis on anger prevention. The fact that he offers advice on merely restraining anger shows an awareness that his audience is one of male Roman aristocrats for whom anger was largely a part of everyday routine. Later history The work survives due to being a part of the Codex Ambrosianus (no. 90) manuscript which dates from the 11th century. See also *Belief References Further reading *John M. Cooper, J.F.

Location and surroundings  The mountain's southeastern ar√™te, with its jagged teeth and rock slabs, separates the cirques of the Sattelkar and Noppenkar and forks behind the Luxnach Saddle where the grassy ridge of the H√§selgehrberg branches off. To the north a steep rock face drops 300 metres into the dark, wooded Hornbach valley.  First ascent  The Noppenspitze was first climbed on 16 August 1890 by Anton Spiehler and his guide, Johann Schiffer. Approaching the main crest of the Hornbach chain from the Noppenkar to the south, the two mountaineers crossed below the wild precipices to the north and completed their ascent to the summit from that direction.  Ascent  The Noppenspitze is a rarely climbed mountain. According to the summit book in 2006, it was only being climbed about 5 - 15 times per year. In order to reach the highest point, a long approach and a climb through 1,500 metres of height is required. In addition, there are no tracks or paths to the summit and it requires sure-footedness and a head for heights as well as a good sense of direction in the trackless and confusing terrain. The technical climbing required on the normal route up the southwest flank is assessed as UIAA grade II.

At the time of his death, he was deputy chief of the Popular Mobilisation Committee (Al-Hashd Al-Sha'abi). The organisations he oversaw have been reported to have close links to the Quds Force, part of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Since 1977 he was a huge opponent to the Saddam Hussain and rose quickly in the ranks due to his popular support amongst the people after the regime fell. Muhandis enjoyed popular support among the Iraqi people prior to and after his death due to his exceptional role in the defeat of ISIS. He became the commander of many various popular volunteer militias that grew for the need to combat ISIS, including the Kata‚Äôib Hezbollah militia group. and prior to that worked with the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps against the Saddam Hussein regime. Allegations of terrorism have been levelled against him over his activities in Kuwait in the 1980s. He was sentenced to death in absentia in 2007 by a court in Kuwait for his involvement in the 1983 Kuwait bombings. Muhandis was on the United States list of designated terrorists. See paragraph 5 of the report. However this has been disputed due to his role in combating the Ba‚Äôath regime rather than supporting it (via attacking Kuwait). The charges were dropped when the new Iraqi government was formed in 2004. He was killed by a targeted U.S. drone strike at Baghdad International Airport on 3 January 2020, which also killed Iranian Armed Forces Major General Qasem Soleimani.  Biography  Jamal Jaafar al-Ibrahimi was born on 1 July 1954 in Abu Al-Khaseeb District, Basra Governorate, Iraq, to an Iraqi father and an Iranian mother. He finished his studies in engineering in 1977 and in the same year joined the Shia-based Dawa Party, which opposed the Ba'athist government. Military career On 1979, after the activity of the Dawa Party was banned and hundreds of opponents were sentenced to death by Saddam Hussein Al- Muhandis fled, across the border to Ahvaz in Iran, where the Iranians had set up a camp to train Iraqi dissidents, with the aim of undermining Saddam. He was known as Jamal al-Ibrahimi in Iran and he became a citizen of Iran by marrying a woman. He began working with Iran's Revolutionary Guard in Kuwait in 1983, organizing attacks on embassies of countries that supported Saddam in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Hours after the December 1983 bomb attacks on U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait, he fled to Iran. He was later convicted and sentenced to death in absentia by a court in Kuwait for planning the attacks. He was later appointed a military adviser to the Quds Force, advising on attacks against Iraqi military based in his hometown of Basra. He returned to Iraq following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and went on to serve as a security adviser to the first Iraqi prime minister after the invasion, Ibrahim al-Jaafari. In 2005 he was elected to the Iraqi Parliament as a Dawa Party representative for the Babil Governorate. When U.S. officials realised his identity and connection with the 1983 attacks, they raised the issue with then-Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki in 2006 or 2007. He had to flee to Iran. He formed Kata'ib Hezbollah between 2003 and 2007.Testimony before the Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South and Central Asian Affairs of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Washington, DC June 8, 2010 He returned to Iraq following the withdrawal of US troops (December 2011) to head the Kata'ib Hezbollah militia; he then became deputy chief of the Popular Mobilization Forces. On 31 December 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo named al- Muhandis, along with Qais Khazali, Hadi al-Amiri, and Falih Alfayyadh, as responsible for the attack on the United States embassy in Baghdad. Qasem Soleimani (left) with Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis (right) at a 2017 ceremony commemorating the father of Soleimani, in Musalla, Tehran. On 3 January 2020, al-Muhandis was killed along with Qasem Soleimani in a U.S. airstrike at Baghdad International Airport. War against ISIL in Iraq After the formation of the popular mobilization units (PMF) as a group in 2014, he was appointed to command the group. The PMF group composed of some 40 militias that fought in nearly every major battle against ISIL.  Sanctions  In 2009, al-Muhandis was sanctioned by the United States Department of the Treasury for allegedly helping the IRGC. Death Abu Mahdi was killed on 3 January 2020 around 1:00a.m. local time (22:00 UTC 2January), by missiles shot from American drones which targeted Qasem Soleimani and his convoy near Baghdad International Airport. BBC News, NBC News, DW News, Time, The Guardian and other media outlets have described the killing as an assassination. Reaction The designated as terrorist organization by Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group mentioned him as one of the symbols of Iraqi liberation from the US occupation and also condolences to the Iraqi for the death of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Funeral and burial On 4 January, a funeral procession for Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and Soleimani was held in Baghdad with thousands of mourners in attendance, waving Iraqi and militia flags and chanting \\"death to America, death to Israel\\". The procession started at the Al-Kadhimiya Mosque in Baghdad. Iraq's prime minister, Adil Abdul- Mahdi, and leaders of Iran-backed militias attended the funeral procession. They were taken to the holy Shia cities of Najaf and Karbala were held funeral prayers on them. He was transferred to Iran for the DNA test. A funeral procession was started from Ahvaz then was taken them to Mashhad. On 6 January, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei held funeral prayers among hundreds of thousands of people and crying in front of the flag-draped coffins for the deceased. On 7 January, his body was returned to Iraq and transferred to his hometown of Basra. His burial was delayed because of the huge crowd at the funeral. On 8 January, Al-Muhandis was buried in Iraq's Najaf where hundreds of mourners gathered to pay their final respects. Funeral processions were also held in several Iraqi cities prior to Najaf, including Baghdad and Karbala.

After 1972 he became widely known for his role as Oberleutnant J√ºrgen H√ºbner in Polizeiruf 110, a long running television series that originated in the German Democratic Republic, but which continues to win large television audiences across Germany, following reunification. Like many German actors, he also found work as a voice-over artist, dubbing English language films for domestic audiences: one of these jobs involved becoming the German language voice of Charlton Heston for his role in \\"Antony and Cleopatra\\". His brother was the writer (who himself has written a handful of episodes of Polizeiruf 110). Life J√ºrgen Frohriep was born in the port city of Rostock. When he was 11 the war broke out, towards the end of which he was involved in national air- defence as a \\"Flak helper\\". When the war ended, in May 1945, Frohriep, by now aged 17, found that his home city had become part of the Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany. His school days being behind him, he took casual work in the locally based boat and fishing industries, and in farming. Fairly early on he also became involved with the FDJ (Freie Deutsche Jugend / Free German Youth) amateur theatre movement. He never received any formal training as an actor, but was nevertheless recruited in 1951 by the Friendship Theatre (as it was then called) in Berlin. By this time the soviet occupation zone had become the German Democratic Republic (GDR), formally founded in October 1949, and after his debut at the Friendship Theatre there followed a succession of stage appearances at various theatres, including those at Stralsund, Erfurt and Altenburg, across the GDR. At the end of the 1950s Konrad Wolf chose Frohriep for the lead role of his anti-war film, Stars (Sterne). As the brother of the country's intelligence chief, Markus Wolf, Konrad Wolf had good establishment connections, and his casting of Frohriep marked a career break-through for the latter. Frohriep became a permanent member of the DEFA, the state-owned film studio, frequently finding himself cast in soldierly roles. In Wolf Among Wolves (1965, but based on a novel written three decades earlier by Hans Fallada) he played the part of Lt. Fritz, an officer in the illicit Black Reichswehr, for which he won a \\"silver laurel crown\\" (Silber Lorbeer). In 1966 he appeared in the biographical film \\"No victory without a fight\\" (\\"Ohne Kampf kein Sieg\\"), portraying the Mercedes-Benz racing driver Manfred von Brauchitsch. Towards the end of the 1960s offers of film roles began to dry up, but in 1973 he took a supporting role in The Legend of Paul and Paula. From 1973 Frohriep's career was focused on television. In 1972 he started to appear as Police-Oberleutnant J√ºrgen H√ºbner in the police drama series Polizeiruf 110. His character was initially rather overshadowed by Police-Captain Peter Fuchs, played by Peter Borgelt. By 1991 J√ºrgen Frohriep's character had nevertheless appeared in 64 episodes, which was more than any other apart from the ubiquitous Captain Fuchs himself. During this time he was also obtaining a lot of dubbing work, voicing parts in English language films for German audiences. After the demise, as a stand- alone state, of the German Democratic Republic, Frohriep, who was 62 in 1990, stopped being offered parts. He was reported to be suffering from depression. His wife had suspended her own career as an actress to concentrate on their family when they had married some two decades earlier, but now she started to study Psychology, after which she relocated to Switzerland and opened a Psychotherapy practice in Walenstadt as Kati Sz√©kely-Frohriep. The marriage had broken up. In a reunited Germany, the National Broadcaster, ARD decided that \\"Polizeiruf 110\\" was one of a handful of previously East German television shows that should have a future. In 1994 Frohriep returned to the series, now promoted, as Chief Commissioner H√ºbner for one last episode entitled \\"Polizeiruf 110: No love, no life\\". He died in Berlin a few weeks after the episode had been filmed, but before it had been transmitted.

Considered by scholars to be one of Mao's most enthusiastic adherents, he took a hard line on land reform in Tibetan areas of Sichuan in 1956 and played a central role in the massive starvation of Chinese citizens in Sichuan province and Chongqing during the Great Leap Forward.  Origins and Family Life  Li was a Hakka peasant born into a landlord peasant Hakka family in Huichang County, southern Jiangxi in 1908. He began studying Marxist theory in his youth, joined the Communist Youth League in 1927, and became a full member of the Communist Party of China in 1930. In 1941, he married Xiao Li (ËÇñÈáå), with whom he would have five sons and two daughters.  Long March and the Anti-Japanese War  During the 1930s, Li served as a political commissar in the Red Army, and participated in the Long March. During the Second Sino- Japanese War, Li commanded military actions against the Japanese invasion in the northwest of China, including Inner Mongolia and Shanxi. In 1942, he joined the Counter-Japanese Military University in Yan'an, working under the direction of Lin Biao.  Establishing CCP Power in Sichuan  In 1949, working with He Long and Liu Bocheng, and Li commanded his troops to occupy all of Sichuan province. It was then that he met Deng Xiaoping, the secretary of the Southwest Bureau responsible for Sichuan, with whom he would have a long working relationship. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Li became one of the dominant political figures in Sichuan. As in other areas of the Southwest, public security was a major early concern and Mao Zedong praised and rewarded leaders who forcefully approached \\"anti-bandit\\" activity and the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries.  Socialist Transformation and Conflict with Tibetans in Sichuan, 1955‚Äì1957  In October 1955, Mao Zedong called for an acceleration of agricultural collectivization around China. While Mao had explicitly exempted Tibet from this campaign, he had also left many decisions to local officials and warned them that those who were not able to carry out the cooperatives would simply be replaced. Li advocated enthusiastically the establishment of socialist cooperatives in 1955. This led to friction with Tibetans in the western part of Sichuan province, otherwise known as the Kham region. On his return to Chengdu from Beijing in October 1955, Fan Zhizong, another advocate of the Maoist reforms, warned Li that military preparations were needed in order to anticipate Tibetan resistance to the policy, but Li told him that he would wait until December to make such a decision. In Chengdu, Li explained to Tibetan representatives that their community would have to take a rapid leap forward into socialism, but failed to translate any of the documents into Tibetan text, leading Tibetan participants in the meeting to describe him as arrogant. Li made a concession to the Tibetan delegates by building them new homes in Chengdu, but they were essentially under house arrest and unable to push back against the policy. Other cadre like Fan Ming had little patience for Tibetan delays, and saw monks and monasteries as particular sources of resistance which would ultimately need to be crushed. As described by the anthropologist and historian Melvyn Goldstein, Li overrode the concerns of the United Front Work Department and the PRC's State Ethnic Affairs Commission who had argued against his proposal for a trial period of land reform in Ganzi, a Tibetan area of western Sichuan, in 1956. Chinese officials gathered together Tibetan peasants to provide \\"class education\\" and prepare for land reform and cooperatives, and also attempted to disarm the Khamba Tibetans, many of whom owned rifles. These steps angered local Tibetans and in February 1956, a number of uncoordinated attacks began against Chinese officials and soldiers, reaching most of Ganzi's eighteen counties. The Litang Monastery was a particular site of resistance; the Tibetans there had about a thousand rifles and when Chinese officials demanded they disarm and start land reforms in February 1956, a decision was made by the Tibetans to fight, and some Chinese workers were attacked on March 9, 1956. Li Jingquan originally responded to the crisis by advocating pulling back all troops, but then sent in two thousand Chinese soldiers into Litang to crush the uprising. Dozens or hundreds of monks and Chinese soldiers were killed in the battle of Litang monastery. On 21 April 1951, as provincial governor Li Jingquan ordered the execution of 6,000 'landlords' in the ethnic region of western Sichuan to kickstart the land reform campaign.  Activities during the Great Leap Forward, 1958‚Äì1961  After Mao Zedong launched the Anti-Rightist Movement in 1957, Li became more radical, persecuting more than 50,000 \\"bourgeoisie rightist\\" elements, which represented 10% of the rightists persecuted nationwide during the movement. From 1958 to 1961, he participated enthusiastically in the Great Leap Forward movement. Li's radical policies created major food shortages in Sichuan (a province famous for its crop surpluses), particularly the impoverished hilly ethnic regions in the mountains of western Sichuan and Chongqing where most of the people who were starved to death in the province were from, indicated that famine in the province was widespread, leading to the deaths of over 8 million people from starvation, disease or murder during the Great Leap Forward according to official statistics. In 1961, Li was made Party Secretary of the Southwestern Bureau of China, and retained his position as Party Secretary of Sichuan province. In March 1958, Li Jingquan welcomed Mao Zedong to Chengdu, accompanying the leader to the Dujiangyan dam on March 21, 1958. Mao's visit to the Hongguang Collective was celebrated in both provincial and national propaganda narratives. Li, however, was dissatisfied with the agricultural results in Pi county where Mao had visited. According to Yang Jisheng's extensive history of the Great Leap Forward in Sichuan, Li Jingquan supported Mao strenuously throughout the campaign, even in periods when Mao's line seemed to be losing momentum. During the campaign, Li received a large number of county-level documents in Sichuan (then included all areas of Chongqing and parts of Tibetan areas), in particular the impoverished hilly ethnic regions in the mountains of western Sichuan and Chongqing where most of the people who were starved to death in the province were from, indicated that famine in the province was widespread. However, he chose to emphasize that other reasons such as hookworm might be responsible for deaths, downplayed major problems in the pork supplies in Sichuan, and pushed forward with overreporting grain totals even at the times when Mao himself had instructed the Party not to inflate the numbers. Sichuan therefore became one of the worst-hit famine provinces during the Great Leap Forward, with estimates as high as eight to ten million excess deaths.  Struggled Against and Rehabilitated during the Cultural Revolution, 1966‚Äì1976  During the Cultural Revolution, Li was branded an enemy of the Party, relieved of all political and administrative positions, and imprisoned. Posters and Red Guard slogans attacked him as being in a clique with Deng Xiaoping. He was released in 1972 and rehabilitated in 1973.  Later Life, 1977‚Äì1989  Following the Cultural Revolution, Li served as a Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and as a member of the 10th and 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Personal life Li's wife Xiao Li was tortured during the Cultural Revolution and committed suicide. His son, a student at the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics was also killed by Red Guards.

It formed the eastern shore of the Great Gulf (Gulf of Thailand) east of the Golden Chersonese (Malaysia), replacing the \\"unknown lands\\" which Ptolemy and others had thought surrounded the \\"Indian Sea\\". Name The peninsula known to modern cartographers as the \\"Dragon's Tail\\" or \\"Tiger's Tail\\" appeared under various names on different maps. History Martellus world map held by Yale University, the first Ptolemaic map in Europe to include the Dragon's Tail rather than leave the Indian Ocean landlocked  Early history  The peninsula does not appear in any surviving manuscript of Ptolemy's Geography or other Greek geographers. Instead, it is first attested in the Ptolemaic- influenced Book of the Description of the Earth compiled by al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ around 833 AD. Ptolemy's map ended at 180¬∞E of the Fortunate Isles without being able to explain what might lie on the imagined eastern shore of the Indian Ocean or beyond the lands of the Sinae and of Serica in Asia. Chinese Muslims traditionally credit the Companion Sa ød ibn Abi Waqqas with having missionized the country as early as the 7th century; the trading community was large enough that a large-scale massacre is recorded at Yangzhou in 760 amid the An Shi Rebellion against the Tang. Merchants such as Soleiman showed Al- KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ that the Indian Ocean was not closed as Hipparchus and Ptolemy had held but opened either narrowly or broadly. Al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ left most of Ptolemy's eastern coast but the creation of the strait created a new peninsula, beyond which he placed the Sea of Darkness and the Island of the Jewel. Martin of Bohemia's Erdapfel Bartholomew Dias passed the Cape of Good Hope during a major storm in 1488; within a year or two, Martellus had published a world map showing the communication of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, creating an unconnected south point of Africa and transforming the eastern end of Ptolemy's shoreline into a great peninsula, similar to that described by Al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´. The area was detailed with locations from Marco Polo and other travelers, including positions formerly related to Ptolemy's Golden Chersonese. A similar peninsula then appeared on the Erdapfel globe drafted by Martin of Bohemia in 1492, just prior to Columbus's return. In the mid-16th century, Ant√≥nio Galv√£o mentioned a map that had been purchased in 1428 by Dom Pedro, eldest son of John I, which described the Cape of Good Hope and included \\"the Strait of Magellan\\" under the name \\"Dragon's Tail\\" (). Some South American scholars have taken this at face value as evidence of early and thorough exploration of the Americas, but their claims have not been substantiated. The 1502 Cantino planisphere, showing the Dragon's Tail united with the Golden Chersonese. Christopher Columbus‚Äîat least initially‚Äîbelieved in the existence of the peninsula, whose position and attendant islands considerably shortened the expected distance from the African coast to East Asia. He may have been guided directly by Martellus's maps. Columbus considered himself to have arrived at Champa, which figured prominently in three inscriptions on Martellus's 1491 map, and cartographers began to draw discoveries in Central America on the eastern shore of the phantom peninsula. Amerigo Vespucci also considered himself to have arrived at this peninsula rather than a new world. Another form of this peninsula appeared in the 1502 Cantino planisphere smuggled out of Portugal for the Duke of Ferrara. The map has lost the Great Gulf and the peninsula continues to be too large, but it has merged with the Golden Chersonese as a single landform and bent more towards the east, apparently influenced by Arabic sources. Pietro Coppo's map (1520) is one of the last ones to show the Dragon's Tail. The Portuguese were aware of the peninsula's likely nonexistence by shortly after the fall of Malacca, when Albuquerque acquired a large Javanese map of Southeast Asia. The original was lost aboard the Froll de la Mar shortly afterwards but a tracing by Francisco Rodrigues was sent in its place as part of a letter to the king. Nonetheless, published maps continued to include it in different forms for another century. Details The southern end of the peninsula was generally known as the Cape of Cattigara. Martellus's world maps include labels marking the areas of Upper India (India Superior), Champa (Ciamba Provincia), and Greater Champa (Ciamba Magna Provincia).

It is based on the film Donnie Brasco directed by Mike Newell in 1997. The series is written by Larissa Andrade and Rodrigo Ordo√±ez, and directed by Chava Cartas and Mauricio Cruz. Daniel Ucros and Gabriela Valentan are the Executive producers. Starring by Alfonso Herrera, Dami√°n Alc√°zar and Itahisa Machado.  Plot  Inspired by the 1997 American drama Donnie Brasco, El Dandy tells the story of a law professor who has been hired by the Attorney General, to participate in a program of special operations, where he must infiltrate one of the most notorious drug cartels of Mexico City. Under the false name Daniel \\"El Dandy\\" Bracho (Alfonso Herrera), he begins the task of identifying all the members of this clandestine network. However, he quickly finds that his acute ability to police work is only comparable with the exciting sense of danger that experiences living life to the fullest. Along the way, it avails itself of the help of a criminal's petty, loyal, even corrupt, ally called El Chueco (Dami√°n Alc√°zar), who quickly befriends Bracho and comes dangerously close to discover his true identity. Much deeper, Bracho is involved in the mafia, more work tells him to get out, and the professor, once incorruptible, has to choose between returning to a normal life as a respectable citizen or fully embrace his criminal life.

The main library is located on the main campus in Brooklyn, NY, with a branch library in Manhattan. The collection focus includes the arts, architecture, design, information science and allied fields. Holdings include 200,000 printed volumes, over 600 periodicals, rare books, digital images resources including Pratt Institute specific Digital Image Collection, and the Institute's archives. It has the distinction of being the ‚Äúfirst free public library in Brooklyn‚Äù and its Brooklyn building is a New York City designated landmark. History The library at Pratt Institute opened in 1888 in the Main Building on Pratt's campus in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn. The library moved into a new building located on Ryerson Street in May 1896. Originally called the Pratt Institute Free Library, it was open to anyone who lived or worked in Brooklyn. Branch libraries of the Pratt Institute Free Library included the Astral Branch‚Äîlocated on the ground floor of the Astral Apartments (another Charles Pratt initiative), and the Long Island Branch at 571 Atlantic Ave. By 1940 the Pratt Libraries closed to the public, partly because the Brooklyn Public Library was able to support the needs of the community. Some scenes from the 1978 adult film Debbie Does Dallas were filmed in the library. Architecture Stairwell of the library The building was designed by William B. Tubby, with interiors by Tiffany & Company. The three- story brick building was designed in a Renaissance Revival style. A feature of the interior is a marble staircase and pillars. The floors of the book stacks are made of glass and the stacks are a design by Library Bureau, which include oak shelves and copper-plated iron supports. Early renovations included the addition of a Children's Porch in 1912 to provide direct access to the Children's Room. The North Porch was added in the 1930s by architect John Mead Howells. Renovations in the early 1980s by architects Giorgio Cavaglieri and Warren Gran included the removal of the Children's Porch to another building on campus, an underground extension including additional stacks, study areas, and classroom with an outdoor mall above, and the addition of a climate- control system. In 1981 the library building in Brooklyn was officially designated a New York City Landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.

D. Reese, was an American civil rights activist, educator and minister from Selma, Alabama. Known as a member of Selma's \\"Courageous Eight\\",The Civil Rights Movement in Selma, Alabama, 1865-1972, National Park Service Reese was the president of the Dallas County Voters League (DCVL) when it invited the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Martin Luther King Jr. to Selma to amplify the city's local voting rights campaign.F.D. Reese Interview, Oral Histories, Birmingham Public Library Digital Collections This campaign eventually gave birth to the Selma to Montgomery marches, which later led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. Reese was also president of the Selma Teachers Association, and in January 1965 he mobilized Selma's teachers to march as a group for their right to vote. Reese retired from teaching and from February 2015 and until his death in April 2018, he was active as a minister at Selma's Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church.Kokomo Herald, \\"Civil Rights hero impacts local faith community\\", February 19, 2015 Early life Reese was born in Selma, Alabama. In 1951, he graduated from Alabama State University, where he majored in math and science where he received a Master's degree. Reese spent nine years in Millers Ferry, Alabama, ending in 1960. This is where he began his teaching career, teaching science and serving as assistant principal. During his time in Millers Ferry, he met Alline Toulas Crossing, whom became Mrs. Reese on June 28, 1953 and remained his life long companion for 64 years. Five children were born as a result of their union. Pastor (Servant Leader) Reese became the pastor of Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church, in Selma, Alabama on March 21, 1965. He accepted the responsibility of Pastor and on the same day joined the front line of the successful march known as the Selma to Montgomery march. Selma Voting Rights Movement In 1960, Reese moved home to Selma, started teaching science and math at R. B. Hudson High School, and joined the Dallas County Voters League (DCVL), the major civil rights organization in Selma since the state of Alabama started actively suppressing the NAACP in 1956.\\"1956\\", Civil Rights Movement VeteransN.A.A.C.P. v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449 (1958) Two years after joining the DCVL, he was elected its president. In 1962, while Reese was a DCVL member, the organization encouraged Bernard Lafayette of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to come to Selma to assist in the voting rights struggle by educating black citizens about their right to vote. As president of the DCVL, Reese signed and sent the DCVL's invitation to Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to come to Selma to lend their support to the voting rights campaign there. King and the SCLC agreed to come, and they started their public engagement in Selma's voting rights campaign on January 2, 1965, with a mass meeting in violation of an injunction against large gatherings.\\"1965: Selma & the March to Montgomery\\", Civil Rights Movement Veterans On January 18, about 400 people marched on the county courthouse to register to vote; on January 19, the people marched again, and this time police violence towards DCVL's Amelia Boynton and the arrest of 67 marchers brought the movement to national headlines.\\"Selma to Montgomery,\\" National Park Service brochure Teachers' March In 1965, Reese held the simultaneous leadership positions of DCVL president and president of the Selma Teachers Association. The first act he made as the Teachers Association president was to sign a proclamation in the presence of the superintendent and assistant superintendent, declaring that teachers should register to vote. Reese even asked that the superintendent allow black teachers to use their free period during the school day to register to vote, though he knew it was an \\"abominable thing to ask\\" in that political and social climate. Reese and fellow teacher and DCVL member Margaret Moore challenged their colleagues, \\"How can we teach American civics if we ourselves cannot vote?\\" On January 22, three days after Amelia Boynton's encounter with police, and three days before another demonstration in front of the county courthouse where Annie Lee Cooper (portrayed by Oprah Winfrey in the 2014 film Selma) had a violent encounter with Sheriff Jim Clark, Reese gathered 105 teachers‚Äîalmost every black teacher in Selma‚Äîto march on the courthouse. The teachers climbed the steps but were barred from entering to register. They were pushed down the steps twice, the police jabbing them with nightsticks.The Selma Voting Rights Struggle & March to Montgomery, Bruce Hartford, 2014 Officials reportedly urged against the teachers' arrest, saying, \\"Don't arrest these people because what you going do with the 7,000 students that we have running around here when they go back to school Monday?\\"\\"Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail,\\" National Park Service It was the first time in Civil Rights Movement that teachers in the South publicly marched as teachers; they were the largest black professional group in Dallas County, and their actions inspired involvement from their students and others who were unsure about participating in demonstrations.Video: Teachers in Selma March for the Right to Vote Selma to Montgomery marches marching from Selma to Montgomery, behind and to the right of children During the time the SCLC spent organizing and protesting in Selma, Reese coordinated meetings and often played the role of mediator when differences of opinion arose. In photographs from the Selma to Montgomery marches, Reese is pictured in a dark suit, coat, and hat, most often in the front of the march with Martin Luther King, Jr. and some of his closest associates. Reese has been credited as the leader whose persistent and continual efforts lead to the Voting Rights Act. He has earned the title of Mr. Voting Rights. His self-sacrifice and dedication to nonviolence, created the climate of welcoming others to link arm in arm in a movement that changed the United States of America. In the words of U. S. Congressman John Lewis, ‚ÄúI first met the Rev. Reese in 1963 on my first trip to Selma when I became the chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He was one of the leaders of the local movement and became more of a leader during the whole effort to gain the [right to] vote in Selma. He was highly respected, and he welcomed us into Selma in our efforts to help the local movement.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Rev. Reese‚Äôs involvement made it possible. He helped create the climate for the Voting Rights Act,‚Äù Lewis said. ‚ÄúPeople all over America and many people around the world knew him because he stood out as this nice, upright man. He didn‚Äôt make a lot of noise. He just did what he felt was his calling. He was consistent and persistent.‚Äù Selma City Councilman Rev. Dr. F. D. Reese served as a city councilman in the City of Selma for 14 years. At one point, he became a mayoral candidate. In creative works Reese was portrayed by E. Roger Mitchell in Ava DuVernay's 2014 film Selma and by Bob Banks in the 1999 film Selma, Lord, Selma.

Gotland has been fortified in stages since the 13th century. During the 20th century, infantry, artillery, air force and naval elements were stationed on Gotland as part of Sweden's defense system, until all permanent military units were stood down in 2005. With tensions in Northeastern Europe and Russia escalating in 2014‚Äì2015, the Swedish government has taken a new interest in remilitarizing the island. And in September 2016 regular troops were once again stationed on the island, albeit as an interim measure until a permanent garrison could be reestablished (currently scheduled for April 2017). As of 1 January 2018 Gotland has re-raised the Gotland Regiment.  History  Since the Iron Age, Gotland has occupied a strategic location in the Baltic Sea from both a trade and military perspective.  Periods of major fortification  The various known establishment of fortifications on Gotland can be roughly broken down into the following broad time periods: * First known period: From around the late 4th century BC (sometime shortly before 200 BC) to the 10th century AD, which may consist of two or more overlapping periods. * Second period: From the 12th century to the 15th century. A time of great discord and open warfare between various polities and interests. The era saw the end of Gotland as an independent kingdom. The fortified town of Visby was built and expanded during this time (founded around the 11th century). * Third period: From the 16th century to the mid 17th century. An unsettled time in both politics and on the battlefield eventually led to the end of Gotland's time as an autonomous entity and it becoming an integral part of Sweden. * Fourth period: From the 1810s to around the 1880s. This period included an industrious time during the 1860s and 1870s when a number of well-designed, major artillery forts, like F√•r√∂sund Fortress and Enholmen Fortress, were constructed. These and other fortifications on Gotland would later serve to help ensure Sweden's neutrality in World War I. * Fifth period: 1939 to 1989. A massive new round of major construction began as the world headed for a new world war, which continued right on into, and throughout the Cold War. From the late 1940s, most of the northern part of Gotland became an even more heavily fortified, military only zone, a status that was only rescinded in the early 1990s.  Cold War  Swedish Army Gotland Garrison in 1989 In 1989 at the end of the Cold War the garrison of Gotland consisted of the following units:http://www.tjelvar.se/ * MKG - Gotland Military Command in Visby had operational control of the brigade and independent battalions in case of war. ** Headquarters and Staff Battalion in Visby ** PB 18 - Gotland Brigade in Visby: *** Headquarters and Staff Company *** 1st Armored Battalion with a staff company, 12x Stridsvagn 102R tanks in one company, 28x KP-car m/42 wheeled armoured personnel carriers and 24x Rifle Squads with 8x Pvpj 1110 90mm recoilless rifles in two companies, 4x M/40 105mm howitzers in an artillery battery and a logistic company *** 2nd Armored Battalion with a staff company, 12x Stridsvagn 102R tanks in one company, 28x KP-car m/42 wheeled armoured personnel carriers and 24x Rifle Squads with 8x Pvpj 1110 90mm recoilless rifles in two companies, 4x M/40 105mm howitzers in an artillery battery and a logistic company *** 3rd Armored Battalion with a staff company, 12x Stridsvagn 102R tanks in one company, 28x KP-car m/42 wheeled armoured personnel carriers and 24x Rifle Squads with 8x Pvpj 1110 90mm recoilless rifles in two companies, 4x M/40 105mm howitzers in an artillery battery and a logistic company *** Artillery Battalion with 12x 155mm Haubits m/F towed howitzers in three batteries *** 18th Armored Reconnaissance Company with 6x KP-car m/42 wheeled armoured personnel carriers, 12x Jeeps, 12x Recon Teams, 2x Rifle Squads and 4x Pvpj 1110 90mm recoilless rifles *** 18th Anti-tank Company with 84mm Carl Gustaf recoilless rifles and Bantam anti-tank missiles *** 18th Engineer Company *** Logistic Battalion ** P 18 - Gotland Regiment in Visby.

Tasked with training field artillery units on Gotland. ** KA 3 - Gotland Coastal Artillery Regiment in F√•r√∂sund trained and fielded a wide variety of units, which in case of war would have come under direct command of the Gotland Military Command: three mobile Coastal Guard Platoons (Sj√∂bevakningspluton) armed with light Robot 17 anti-ship missiles. One heavy anti-ship missile battery armed with Robot 08 missiles. The 7th Coastal Artillery Battery in Bunge with 3x mobile 152mm M/37 cannons. Besides these mobile units the regiment also controlled the following fixed artillery positions: 4x batteries of three 75mm Tornpj√§s m/57 automatic guns each at Kappelshamn, Ljugarn and St Olofsholm on Gotland and at Ryssn√§s on F√•r√∂, 1x battery of three 120mm Tornautomatpj√§s m/70 automatic guns at Slite and 1x battery of three twin-barreled 152mm Kustartilleripj√§s m/51 heavy coastal artillery guns at Bungen√§s. Furthermore, the regiment trained a few smaller units, which maintained minefields with controlled mines along the coast of Gotland and F√•r√∂. Additionally the regiment fielded a limited number of 75mm m/65 automatic cannons, which were a mobile version of the 75mm Tornpj√§s m/57 automatic guns and the small minelayer HSwMS F√•r√∂sund (16). ** Lv 2 - Gotland Anti-Aircraft Battalion in Visby with Robot 69 and Robot 70 man-portable surface-to-air missiles, as well as 20mm lvakan m/40-70 and 40mm lvakan m/48 anti-aircraft autocannons. ** 4th Independent Armored Battalion in Visby with a staff company, 12x Stridsvagn 102R tanks in one company, 28x KP-car m/42 wheeled armoured personnel carriers and 24x Rifle Squads with 8x Pvpj 1110 90mm recoilless rifles in two companies, 4x M/40 105mm howitzers in an artillery battery and a logistic company ** 5th Independent Armored Battalion in F√•r√∂sund with a staff company, 12x Stridsvagn 102R tanks in one company, 28x KP-car m/42 wheeled armoured personnel carriers and 24x Rifle Squads with 8x Pvpj 1110 90mm recoilless rifles in two companies, 4x M/40 105mm howitzers in an artillery battery and a logistic company  21st century  Machine gun bunker) located near Brucebo, Gotland County Despite expectations at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century bringing with it a new millennium, Gotland's strategic importance has continued. In a recognition of this, the Swedish government decided in March 2015 to begin reestablishing a permanent military presence on the island, starting with an initial 150 troop garrison, consisting primarily of elements from the Swedish Army. It has been reported that the bulk of this initial garrison will make up a new motorised rifle battalion, alternatively referred to in other reports as a \\"modular-structured rapid response Army battalion\\". , it is unclear whether the Gotland Regiment and the associated Gotland Brigade as well as the Gotland Artillery Regiment, key components of the previous garrison (disestablished in 2005), will also be reconstituted. Prior to the closure of the original garrison, there had been a continuous Swedish military presence on Gotland in one form or another, for nearly 200 years. After the standing down of the original garrison, a battalion of the Swedish Home Guard is based on Gotland for emergencies as part of the Eastern Military Region (MR E). The unit, 32:a Gotlandsbataljonen (the 32nd Gotland battalion, also known as the Gotlandshemv√§rns bataljonen) acts as a training/reserve element of the regular 1st Marine Regiment (Amf 1) based at Musk√∂ island, itself part of the Swedish Amphibious Corps. Among the residual war reserve stocks reported to be still in storage on Gotland in March 2015, were 14 tanks (Stridsvagn 122s) at the Tofta firing range (the Tofta skjutf√§lt), but without any crews or dedicated maintenance personnel assigned to them. Between 2005 and 2019, Gotland had no local air defence capability. Tentative plans to deploy the RBS 23 BAMSE short range air defense system on Gotland were scrapped with the shutdown of the garrison in 2005, and the air force has not generally operated interceptors or other tactical aircraft from the island since the early 1990s. However on 1 July 2019, it was announced that the Luftv√§rnssystem (Air Defence System) 23 would be deployed to the island of Gotland. Despite its importance as a naval base in the past, , there are no naval units based out of Gotland. Since 2000, there have been no coastal artillery units or facilities operational on Gotland.  Gotland Garrison  The original Gotland garrison, also known as the Visby Garrison, could trace its roots back to at least 1811. That was the year the Gotland National Conscription was formed to strengthen the islands defences after the Russians had briefly occupied the island two years before. Although, the \\"new\\" garrison was just the latest in a long line of Swedish military forces protecting the island, and consequently the rest of Sweden, continuously since the 1640s. The exception being the 23 days when Russia occupied the island during the Finnish War (1808‚Äì1809), after Gotland had been left undefended due to errors in overall Swedish strategy early in the war. In 1887, a new country wide conscription system replaced a number of previous regional recruitment and reserve systems, including the Gotlands nationalbev√§ring (the Gotland National Recruitment). The existing regiment defending Gotland under that system was reorganized into two new regiments, the Gotland Infantry Regiment and the Gotland Artillery Regiment. Those two units would go on to provide the bulk of the garrison forces both directly and indirectly, throughout the various crisis that threatened to overtake Sweden (including two World Wars and the Cold War), for most of the next two centuries right up to the final dissolution of the garrison in 2005.  Garrison structure  From 1811 to 1873, the commander of military forces on Gotland (at that time, effectively a military district in its own right) also served as the governor of the island and during the existence of the Gotland National Conscription (1811‚Äì1892) the commander was by default the senior officer of that regiment. Under the military reorganisation of 1892, the then commander and his successors (up until 1937) automatically became the senior officer of the Gotlands infanteriregemente that succeeded the Gotlands nationalbev√§ring. He remained in charge of army troops on the island, even though Gotland was no longer the center of a military district under the new 5 area (district) system which lasted up to shortly before World War II. During World War II, Gotland was part of both the VII Military Area [area=army district] (from 1942) and the Gotland Naval District, both of which the senior military officer on the island acted as head of. Army and air force units assigned to Gotland came under the former, while naval, marine, and coast artillery units based on / out of Gotland came under the jurisdiction of the latter. With a change in the Naval Districts (see naval section below) in 1957, the commanding officer lost his maritime responsibilities, but regained them in the 1966 military reorganisation that created the Gotland Military Command (MKG), and which changed the VII Military Area into the new expanded Eastern Military Area (Milo √ñ) (also known as Milo Z) which was now headquartered out of S√∂dermanland. This command structure continued relatively unchanged until the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s, when Milo √ñ was stood down in 1991. The MKG remained operational into 2000, albeit increasingly downgraded in importance despite concerns, with a corresponding steady reduction in the units and capabilities under the MKG. In the now discredited Swedish Defence reform of that year, the MKG was replaced with the, in theory, autonomous Gotland Military District (MDG), which despite its name, only had control over the island itself (that control was also severely constrained by the existence of the, later infamous, post-Cold War Swedish Fortifications Agency). In practise this meant the MDG was responsible for overseeing the Army garrison units remaining on the island, along with coordinating with any reserve and civil defense elements still in place. There were, and still are, no maritime or coastal defense units remaining on the island, with the exception of a couple of naval units that did not come under the new MDG and which in any case were withdrawn in 2004. The MDG was stood down in December 2004, with the remaining garrison forces being abolished in 2005.  Elements of the former garrison: Navy  = 1700‚Äì1970s = G√∂teborg-class Saab Robot 08 (Kustrobot 08) at the museum at Gotland Coastal Artillery Regiment (KA 3) in F√•r√∂sund, Sweden Alongside the Swedish Army, the Swedish Navy have played a major role in the garrisoning of the island over the last two centuries; not only helping to defend the island but also using it as a well placed base to defend Sweden and its interests in the Baltic Sea. Prior to (from 1931) and during World War II, Gotland was the headquarters of the Gotland Naval District. In 1957, during the Cold War, Gotland became part of the (now defunct) Sound Naval District, headquartered at the Musk√∂ naval base. The Sound Naval District itself came under the new joint Eastern Military District in 1966, with operational control of naval units (including coastal defense forces) in the area of the former Gotland Naval District being returned to the commanding officer of the new MKG centered on Gotland. In the early part of the Cold War (late 1940s to late 1950s), elements of one of the three major task forces that then made up the navy's front line strength, including cruisers and destroyers, were based out of Gotland's various anchorages and harbours. This was in addition to locally based elements of the Coastal Artillery's significant support fleet, which included coastal minelayers, inshore minesweepers, and patrol craft. However, in 1958, a doctrinal switch from heavier surface combatants to smaller ASW combatants (increasingly corvette sized and smaller) and Fast Attack Craft began with most of the former being retired without replacement. The operations of these new combatants were still coordinated with submarines though, which, along with the fact that some major combatants weren't immediately retired (e.g. the two Halland-class destroyers), ironically helped to disguise the problems with relying so heavily on light combatants in the short term. In the late 1960s, this shift towards lighter types accelerated, though more for political and economic reasons than military. For Gotland, this meant that the naval units based out of the island by the 1970s were mostly light combatants such as FACs with relatively short range, though there were still a few larger corvettes mixed in. Submarines were generally not based out of Gotland at this point, being housed in purpose built bases such as Musk√∂, though they still made port visits. = 1980s ‚Äì = By the early 1980s, flaws with the \\"FAC based doctrine\\" had become impossible to ignore, with incidents such as the so- called Whiskey on the rocks confrontation proving that the Swedish Navy had become outgunned in the Anti-surface warfare arena, and that even in areas where it should have had a local advantage in such as Anti-Submarine Warfare it was materially outmatched by potential aggressors, with intruding submarines able to breach Swedish waters almost at will. In the short term, the navy and government attempted to address these issues with various emergency measures and programs, such as the hasty revamping of the Ytattack-81 (the Surface combatant-81) project into what would become the Stockholm corvette program. Another hastily introduced program was the construction of four new heavy coastal missile batteries based around the Rb 15 missile, one of which was placed on Gotland. Delivery and installation of the systems was to take place from 1987 to 1992. Existing installations such as coastal gun batteries and mine stations were continuously upgraded. In the longer term, among the new programs that were started in the late 1980s were two to provide replacements for various FAC and corvette classes as well as to provide a new class of destroyers; the Ytstridsfartyg Mindre (the Surface Combatant Small) and the Ytstridsfartyg St√∂rre (the Surface Combatant Large) programs. In the post-Cold War cutbacks of the early 1990s, those two programs were merged into a single program, the YS2000 (the Surface Combatant 2000) program, that later became the Visby-class stealth corvette. Originally, it was planned to have a class of 10 in two variants; the ASuW/Anti-Air 'Series II' and a lower cost ASW dedicated 'Series I'. Finally, only four Series Is and a single Series II were built in the 2000s (with a second Series II being cancelled), and even those were not fully manned or equipped as part of further economy measures to support other non-defence areas. As a result of this reduction in class size being decided on in the late 1990s, plans for some of the Visby-class corvettes to be based out of Gotland were scrapped. This was against a background of severe cutbacks for the navy at that time, which would continue into the 2010s. Those cutbacks apparently also led to the cancellation, just prior to the disbanding of all coastal defence units on Gotland, of plans to install elements of the KAFUS coastal/underwater surveillance network in and around the island. In an echo of events from over 60 years earlier, the navy would lose its Marinflyget in 1998, with its helicopter units being absorbed by the air force's new 'joint' Helikopterflottiljen (Helicopter Wing) (the Army also losing its helicopters to this new wing). The air force then promptly retired the former navy ASW helicopters without any immediate replacement. The resulting lack of ASW helicopters, along with the operationally incomplete state of the Visby-class corvettes, were issues that would become apparent just under a decade and a half later, during the 'October 2014 Submarine incident' when the military made a prolonged search without any public results, for alleged underwater activity.  Elements of the former garrison: Air Force  = 1920s‚Äì1980s = AJSF 37 Viggen (37972) on display at the Gotlands F√∂rsvarsmuseum Since the late 1920s, the Swedish Air Force have also played an important part in Gotland's defence, especially during World War II and the succeeding Cold War. Created by the amalgamation of the air arms of both the Army and the Navy in 1926, the formation of the new air force would leave the navy without an air branch until it was reestablished in the late 1950s with the navy's first helicopters. Swedish Naval aviation had already established a major presence on the island in the late 1910s, so the air force was able to take over or share some facilities with the navy, as well as building ones of its own, such as the Bunge and Roma airfields in the late 1930s. By the outbreak of World War II, the Flygvapnet was well established on Gotland. The air force's general wartime strategy in regards to Gotland was primarily based around bombers, in particular 20 B17s based at Bunge airfield and seaplane torpedo bombers out of F√•r√∂sund. The intention was to use them against enemy ships in the support of the navy and coastal defence units (including both gun batteries and minefields), that were the islands first line of defence against an invasion. The air force also had fighters and reconnaissance aircraft based on the island to further support the island's defence, the latter also including seaplanes. Even into the Jet Age, and the Cold War, the Swedish Air Force insisted on remaining being able to operate from semi-prepared airstrips and dispersed emergency airfields, which influenced its equipment development and procurement choices greatly along with the development of tactics and strategies. This allowed the air force major flexibility in its role of defending Gotland and the rest of Sweden against intruders. In some respects, this flexibility made the air force more capable than most NATO member airforces who, especially before the advent of such aircraft as the Harrier and the A-10, were arguably over reliant on permanent airbases and long concrete runways, unlike their Soviet foes, who put in at least as much effort as Sweden into being able to disperse and operate their tactical aircraft from semi-prepared airstrips and other temporary or semi-permanent locations, including those based around specially strengthened stretches of road. For Gotland, this meant the air force was not only able to operate out of Visby Airport (especially after its BAS-60 upgrade in 1968) and its existing airfields such as Bunge and Roma, but also from semi-prepared sites such as the Visby 1 and Visby 2 highway strips, which were officially classified as dispersed emergency (wartime) airfields as per Sweden's general overall Cold War doctrine. Apart from the threat of direct Soviet aggression against Gotland and the rest of Sweden, another potential wartime problem was to increasingly weigh on the minds of both the island's defenders and Sweden's politicians: cruise missile transits. In the event of an all out war, the airspace of neutral Sweden was seen by both NATO and Warsaw Pact planners as a possible handy shortcut for the flight paths of cruise missiles that both sides were developing, and in the case of the United States had already deployed, during the 1980s. The airspace in and around Gotland was one of the areas of Sweden seen as especially vulnerable to transit by cruise missiles en route to their targets. A particular worry in Sweden in the early 1980s was that the US would program some of their new nuclear armed cruise missiles to fly through Swedish airspace on their way to targets in the Soviet Union. This was seen as a violation of the country's neutrality, so Sweden officially stated that it would be obliged to shoot down any such missiles that were fired over Swedish territory in wartime. In light of this policy a number of major anti-cruise missile exercises were held by Sweden during the 1980s, at least one of which was held in and around the island. As the decade went on, fears grew that the Soviet Union would be at least just as likely to violate Sweden's neutrality in this manner; such fears regarding the two superpowers were only partially eased by the advent of the (effectively defunct ) INF Treaty. Late 1980s plans to reinforce the air cover over Gotland, including one for the reactivation and deployment to the island of an additional J 35 Draken squadron to take place in the early 1990s, were to be overtaken by world events such as the Revolutions of 1989 and the Soviet dissolution. = 1990s‚Äì = After the end of the Cold War, the air force's presence on Gotland had rapidly diminished to practically nothing by 1992, with the final withdrawal of deployed elements of the Br√•valla Air Force Wing (F 13) including a Saab 37 Viggen fighter detachment from Visby Airport. This was a direct result of the initial cutbacks by Swedish politicians seeking the peace dividend in order to, among other things, to fund increasingly costly social programs in an economic downturn (in part caused by the fall of the Soviet Union). Due to this, the Bunge airfield was closed in 1991. The Roma airfield had been deactivated in 1988. In the intervening years, the air force has been absent from Gotland, with only the occasional transport or support aircraft (such as ASC 890 Airborne early warning and control) making visits to Visby Airport as part of an exercise or similar. In the 2010s, the relatively dilapidated state of the county's defences had to be addressed by the Swedish government, with a newly resurgent Russia stepping up probes of Sweden's defences alongside those of her neighbours with both air and sea incursions. The most noted of these to date occurred in March 2013, when two Russian Tupolev Tu-22M nuclear capable bombers, escorted by four Sukhoi Su-27, were able to enter Swedish controlled airspace unimpeded and simulate strikes against targets in and around Stockholm with the Swedish Air Force unable to effectively respond at any time during the incident. During their operation, the Russian aircraft skirted around Gotland. In the aftermath of this highly controversial failure to avert the intruders, the air force for the first time in many years deployed a detachment of four Saab JAS 39 Gripen fighters to Visby Airport. This short lived deployment was followed by another smaller one the following year, consisting of two Gripens. However, because of their strictly limited nature, these deployments were seen by observers as unsuccessful PR exercises rather than a coherent response. By the close of 2014, Swedish public confidence in the government's ability to defend the country had dropped to 20% or lower, depending on the poll. This was a continuation of a general trend that could be traced back to even before the Stockholm incident, but which had rapidly worsened in its aftermath. In late March 2015, it was reported that plans were at an advanced stage for a support helicopter squadron and a \\"fast response Gripen jet squadron\\" to be based on Gotland in order to support the new garrison and further reinforce the island's defences.  Tofta firing range  Stridsfordon 90) during an exercise at the Tofta skjutf√§lt The Tofta firing range (also known as the Tofta Tank firing range), is a military training ground which is located south of Visby. Another less common name for the range is the Toftasj√∂n firing range. Tracing its origins back to 1898, as of 2008 the range extended over . It was a major training and storage facility for the Gotland garrison during its existence, and was still occasionally used for training by various elements of the Armed Forces since the garrison was shut down in 2005. However, from the second half of 2014 onwards, there has been a marked increase in the use of the range, especially by armoured units (mostly company sized), as tensions in Northeastern Europe have escalated. At least one of the buildings on the range, the former tank repair shop, is currently owned by a private company (Peab), with the military renting back the top floor for its own use. When not used by the military, a number of cultural and sports events have been held at the range, one of the most notable being the Gotland Grand National, the world's largest enduro race.  Gotlandsgruppen  Succeeding the MDG since 2005, the Gotlandsgruppen (the Gotland's Group) is an administrative group currently consisting of about eight regular officers at any one time. It is nominally responsible for overseeing the maintenance of military facilities along with related activities on the island, though in practice any real authority lies either with the Swedish Fortifications Agency or else the 1st Marine Regiment (1 Amf). In theory, the Gotlandsbataljonen also comes under the purview of the Gotlandsgruppen but again in practice they report directly to their current parent regiment, the 1st Marine Regiment, except for the day to day tasks that the Regimental HQ delegates to the Gotlandsgruppen officers on the ground. Much the same arrangement exists at the Tofta firing range; , the range comes directly under the 1st Marine Regiment for administrative and most operational matters. For work directly onsite, including oversight of any civilian contractors on long term contract or call, the job is again delegated to the Gotlandsgruppen, who have their offices in the range. The unit crest of the Gotlandsgruppen is the same as that of the former Gotland Military Command.  Battlegroup Gotland  In April 2015, a decision was made to reestablish troops permanently on Gotland within three years. The recruitment started in September 2015. The Battlegroup Gotland is to consist of 300 personnel, half of which are soldiers and half a permanent staff. , the main issue of where to house the battle group was still unresolved. The barracks in Visby formerly owned and used by Gotland Regiment were evacuated and sold to a private company in 2006. Since 2006, the property is used by the Gotland County Administration and several private companies. The re-militarization of Gotland once again reopened the debate about a possible threat to Sweden from Russia and Sweden's accession to NATO. The Battlegroup Gotland (18th Battlegroup) will fall under administrative control of the Skaraborg Regiment, which will also train the troops destined for Gotland. The battlegroup will be based at the Tofta firing range near Visby and will field 301 men. * 18th Battlegroup (18. Stridsgruppen): ** 180th Staff Company \\"Havdhem\\" ** 181st Armored Infantry Company \\"Roma\\" with 12x Strf 9040B infantry fighting vehicles, 1x Bgbv 90 armored recovery vehicle and 1x Bandvagn 309 tracked ambulance vehicle ** 183rd Tank Company \\"L√§rbro\\" with 11x Stridsvagn 122 main battle tanks, 1x Epbv 90 forward observation vehicle, 1x Bgbv 120 armored recovery vehicle, 1x Strf 9040B infantry fighting vehicle and 1x Bandvagn 309 tracked ambulance vehicle ** 185th Logistic Company \\"Garde\\" In the meantime, before the 18th Battlegroup is ready for deployment on Gotland (originally scheduled to begin in 2018), it was hoped that a combination of an increase in training rotations by mainland based regular army units to the Tofta range, combined with some rather public exercises around the island by the S√§rskilda operationsgruppen since late 2015, would be enough to discourage any Russian adventurism. However, by Autumn 2016, the regional situation was considered to have deteriorated even further. So much so that following representations from the current Supreme Commander Micael Byd√©n, the Swedish Government reluctantly agreed that Gotland's defences would have to be reestablished on a much shorter timescale than previously mooted (despite ongoing major divisions within the current ruling parties with regards as to the strategy & resources required to defend Sweden). To this end, the Supreme Commander announced on 14 September 2016 that not only would the deployment of the 18th Battlegroup to Gotland would be moved up to the first half of 2017, but also a rifle battalion from the Skaraborg Regiment which was then in the middle of a training rotation at Tofta, would now be held in place on Gotland as an interim garrison. A few Giraffe 40s normally on the strength of the Air Defence Regiment (Lv 6) are to be attached to the battalion to provide some early warning capability. Despite this though, neither air defence vehicles such as the Luftv√§rnskanonvagn (lvkv) 9040, nor MANPADS have been attached to the garrison battalion to take advantage of this local radar coverage. The plan is to within a few months relieve the battalion with another battalion or an equivalent formation, which will then remain in place until the 18th Battlegroup is ready to take up its posting.

Location and surrounding area  The Kreuzkarspitze lies in the Austrian federal state of Tyrol. The municipal boundary between Elbigenalp to the south and Hinterhornbach to the north runs over the summit. The peak rises in the Hornbach chain, which is bounded in the south by the Lech valley and in the north by the Hornbach valley. The East Ar√™te to the Noppenspitze (2,594 m) has a notch (2,458 m) that is the reference point for the Kreuzkarspitze's prominence of 129 metres. The Noppenspitze is also the parent peak for the Kreuzkarspitze's isolation of 1.2 kilometres. Between the two summits lies the Noppenkar. This cirque is separated from another one, the Balschtekar, by the long South Ar√™te of the Kreuzkarspitze. From the West Ar√™te of the Kreuzkarspitze rises the Balschtespitze (2,499 m), before the Hornbach chain descends to the col of Sch√∂neggerscharte (2,257 m). To the north lies the Kreuzkar cirque. On the South Ar√™te are the summits of the S√∂llerk√∂pfe (2,402 m); the ridge then continues over the den Balschte Saddle (2,226 m) to the Rotwand (2,262 m). On the north flank is a small, unnamed glacier and, at the foot of the Kreuzkar, lies the lake of Kreuzkarsee (1983 m).Kompass walking, cyling and ski touring map: Sheet 24, Lechtaler Alpen, Hornbachkette (1:50,000).

Geology  The Kreuzkarspitze is built of brittle main dolomite rock.Ernst Zettler, Heinz Groth: Alpine Club Guide - Allg√§uer Alpen. 12th, fully revised edition. Bergverlag Rudolf Rother, Munich, 1985, (pp. 368ff).  Origin of the name  The name of the mountain comes from the cirque to the north. Why the latter was called Kreuz (\\"cross\\") is not totally clear. Because the farmers from the Lech valley also used pastures in the Hornbach valley, they had to cross the Hornbach chain, which was possible over the col of Sch√∂neggerscharte. It is likely that a cross was erected in its vicinity as a symbol of protection or trust. A summit recorded in 1775 as the Creuzspitze could have been the Schreierkopf.Thadd√§us Steiner: Allg√§uer Bergnamen. 2nd edition, Kunstverlag Josef Fink, Lindenberg, 2008, (pp. 122f).  History  The Kreuzkarspitze was first climbed in 1892 by Chr. Wolff using the present normal route. In 1899, von Cube and his unknown companion scaled the North Face for the first time. The route from the Noppenkar to the South Ar√™te was climbed in 1900 by W. Lossen. The first crossing of the East and West Ar√™tes was also achieved in 1900 by v. Cube and A. Schulze.  Ascent   Normal route  The base for the unmarked ascent of the Kreuzkarspitze is the Hermann von Barth Hut (2,129 m). From there the Enzensperger Way (Weg 435) heads eastwards into the Balschtekar. From there it climbs to the notch (2,348 m) between the Kreuzkarspitze and the Norther S√∂llerkopf, following the South Ar√™te from here to the top. The crux of the tour is a ledge in front of the western subpeak, which is rated as a UIAA grade I climb. In addition the ascent requires a head for heights and sure-footedness.Dieter Seibert: Alpine Club Guide alpin - Allg√§uer Alpen und Ammergauer Alpen. 17th edition, Bergverlag Rother, Munich, 2008, (pp. 339f).  Climbing  Besides the relatively easy normal route there are also climbing routes on the Kreuzkarspitze. The eastern flank and East Ar√™te are grade III climbs, as is the West Ar√™te. The North Face is a grade IV climb.

Adjacent to the tower is the former Istituto Santa Teresa. History The church or oratory was built in 1444 and consecrated in 1448.Impegno per Siena, La misteriosa \\"prigione\\" di Sant'Ansano (01 Dicembre 2012), article by Senio Ghibellini. The design of the church is attributed to Pietro da Minella.Sassetta: The Borgo San Sepolcro Altarpiece, Volume 1 page 14. The church was used as an oratory for the Contrada of the Turtle (Tartuca) until 1663. The brick exterior remains asymmetric and unfinished with some round windows walled up. Over the entrance portal is a retouched fresco depicting the Madonna and Child with Saints Ansano and Caterina da Siena by Francesco Rustici. The oculus above the door has a 17th-century stained glass depicting the saint. Inside there are some remains of 14th-century frescoes. The main altarpiece depicts the Martyrdom of Sant'Ansano also by Francesco Rustici. His father Vincenzo Rustici painted canvases with God the Father and an Annunciation. There are a number of other sites dedicated to Sant'Ansano in the province, including a chapel in the cathedral, a sanctuary where he was buried, and a chapel where he escaped death by boiling.Breve relazione delle cose notabili della citt√† di Siena, ampliata e corretta, by Giovacchino Faluschi, page 65. Legends Legends hold that Sant'Ansano, also known as Sant'Ansano Battista or the Baptist, was jailed in the adjacent tower, which now serves as the bell-tower for the church. Sant'Ansano, venerated as one of the first to convert local pagans to Christianity, while in jail, was said to have continued to baptise many locals from the low window in the tower. However a problem with the story is that the tower likely dates from the 13th century, hence was unlikely to have existed as such during the 4th-century rule of Diocletian during which Sant'Ansano was martyrdom. Sant'Ansano's martyrdom was equally legendary. He was taken outside of the city to be boiled in oil, near the town now called Sant'Ansano, but remained unscathed. From there he was taken to a site near the city, a district called Dofana, where he was decapitated. Each site has churches, sanctuaries or chapels for the saint. He is considered, along with Savino, Crescenzio, and Vittore, one of the four original patron saints of Siena, though their veneration would falter with the addition, over time, to the patronal canon of St Catherine of Siena and San Bernardino of Siena to the roster of local patrons.

As in the rest of the region, livestock and forestry were once the primary economical activities of the area. There are still important sheep and cattle farms here, in some of which meat is constantly being sold. The beekeeping sector is growing in importance, with the production of honey and derivatives, which are promoted by the mayor Villages The villages in the area are: * San Felices de Castilleria * Verde√±a * Estalaya * Herreruela These are smaller villages which maintain contact with Celada by road.

The core members of the band include the three Kettle brothers, who were previously members of The Tansads. As of 2019 the band have released five albums.  History  Guitarist and songwriter John Kettle and his brothers, mandolin player Bob and vocalist Andrew, were members of the 1990s folk rock band The Tansads. In 2010, over a decade since they last performed together, former members of the band reunited for a series of concerts in St Helens. Following the successful gigs, some of the musicians involved, including the three brothers, decided to continue as a band, but rather than use the Tansads name chose to adopt the new name Merry Hell. In addition to the former Tansads, other members of the new band included John Kettle's wife Virginia. Merry Hell were signed to the Mrs Casey Records label on the basis of a demo recording, and in October 2011 released their debut album BLINK.. and you miss it. In 2012, Merry Hell performed at Folk on the Pier in Cromer, the Derbyshire 'Big Session', the Towersey Village Festival, Wickham Festival, and the Great British Folk Festival at Skegness. They also performed an autumn show at St Helens Citadel, billed as \\"Merry Helloween\\". The band's second album, Head Full of Magic, Shoes Full of Rain, was released in 2013, and features a guest performance by Dave Swarbrick, formerly of Fairport Convention. That year the band performed more than forty live shows, and also played at the Acoustic Festival of Britain at Uttoxeter, Off The Tracks in Derbyshire, the Beverley Folk Festival, the Stainsby Festival, the Wickham Festival and Beautiful Days in Devon. In 2014 the band released the EP \\"The Ghost\\", which previewed tracks from their upcoming third album, and took part in the Armistice Pals project, collaborating with other folk artists including Lucy Ward, Christine Collister and Robb Johnson on a version of Pete Seeger's song \\"Where Have All The Flowers Gone\\" to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War.

Kannada had largely fallen out of use in classical form and usage as an official language which was attributed to the reign of Haider Ali and Tipu Sultan when Urdu was used. Thus in the late 19th century, Kannada was mainly used in matters of commerce and personal communication. He was involved in its cultural resurrection during the late 19th and early 20th century. His literary works include first translations of major works in English to Kannada such as The History of Sandford and Merton by Thomas Day, Hamlet and King Lear. Early life M.S. Puttanna (Mysore Suryanarayana Bhatta Puttanna) was born on 21 November 1854 in Mysore, Kingdom of Mysore, as a member of the Hoysala Karnataka Brahmin caste to Suryanarayana and Lakshamma in the parental home of his mother. His given birth name was Lakshmi Narasimha Sastry, but he became known as Puttanna (translates to 'younger big brother') by those around him. Education M.S. Puttanna was educated at home in Mysore by a private Panth teacher. Later he joined the Raja School, which was subsequently renamed Maharaja's College, Mysore after its chief patron, Krishnaraja Wadiyar III the Maharaja of Mysore. There he passed the F.A. (First Arts) examination which is the equivalent of present-day pre-university. After working as a teacher he was admitted to Presidency College, Madras. He graduated from college in 1885 with a Bachelors in Arts degree majoring in Ethics and Logic. Career M.S. Puttanna began his career in Kolar High School in 1878 teaching literature. He was granted a transfer to his alma mater, Raja School Mysore, where he resumed teaching. While teaching at the Raja School he enrolled in classes towards his BA in Ethics and Logic. After graduating from college in 1885, he left his teaching post and took a job as a court translator in the Chief Court of the Kingdom of Mysore, known today as the High Court of Mysore, translating legal documents from English to Kannada and vice versa. He held this job until 1897. In 1897 he was appointed to be the Amildar(administrator of a group of villages) in the Taluk of Chitradurga, Kingdom of Mysore. He later served in the capacity of Amildar in the Mysore Taluks of Nelamangala, Chamrajnagar, Bagepalli, Mulabagal and Hosadurga. While serving as Amildar and advocate, M.S. Puttanna began his literary career around the end of the 19th century. M.S. Puttanna authored 29 works of Kannada literature. His works are associated with the two prominent phases of Kannada literature. One was 'Arunodaya' (pre-renaissance) and the other, 'Navodaya' (renaissance) which overlapped in his lifetime. In addition to his commitment to full-time authorship, he served as editor and contributing author to a monthly literary journal called 'Hitha Bodhini' which loosely translates to 'Teaching the Good' or 'Wise Counsel‚Äô. In Kannada literature he is known to be one of the pioneers of the use of colloquial or common language, effectively broadening the appeal of the language to a wider readership. He was the first Kannada author to record in a biography, the life of a local Kannadiga personage, Kunigal Rama Sastry. He was also the first to translate the works of Thomas Day and William Shakespeare from English to Kannada. He translated 'The Adventures of Hatim Tai' by Duncan Forbes (originally written in 1824). Together with his friend H.V. Nanjundaiah, M.S. Puttanna worked for the founding of the Kannada Sahitya Sammelana (Kannada Literary Institute) in Chamrajpet, Bangalore and served as its first secretary. Based on his prior experience as Amildar, he worked as a secretary for the ‚ÄòRatepayers Association‚Äô (equivalent of today's Tax Revenue Board) preparing reports and chairing meetings held in Kannada. He also supported equal rights for all in the Kingdom of Mysore and demonstrated this by personally honoring a select group of soldiers from all castes at his home in Basavanagudi, Bangalore (where a street is named for him) on their return from action in Europe after the Great War. Death M.S. Puttanna died at age 76 in Bangalore, Kingdom of Mysore in 1930.

After attending high school in Ljubljana, Jesenko enrolled in the University of Vienna and graduated in 1902. During his studies, he became a tutor to two Oriental princes at Vienna's Teresianum college for boys, later also serving in this capacity for Count Merveldt. His position gave him the opportunity to travel all across Europe and later to Egypt, where he studied desert flora. In 1909, he became a research assistant under Erich von Tschermak at the College of Agriculture (Hochschule f√ºr Bodenkultur; now University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences) in Vienna, and a lecturer in 1913. During his period in Vienna, Jesenko commenced several studies on plant hybridisation under von Tschermak's supervision, obtaining fertile hybrids between different varieties of wheat and rye with the help of backcrossing, and studying their characteristics with reference to Mendelian principles. He proposed that the reduced fertility of hybrids was a consequence of chromosomal incompatibility, as well as morphological differences. With this, he was one of the pioneers of studies on triticale and intergeneric hybrids in general. His work was interrupted by World War I, during which Jesenko was sent to the Eastern Front, where he was injured and imprisoned. After the war, he returned to his homeland to become a lecturer at the University of Zagreb (Croatia), and a full professor in 1920. In the meantime, he worked on setting up a botanical institute in Ljubljana and in 1921 became the first professor of botany at the recently established University of Ljubljana. He also continued his studies on plant hybrids and helped found a research station in Beltinci. In addition to plant genetics, Jesenko was notable as one of the proponents of Triglav National Park, the only national park in Slovenia today and one of the earliest in Europe. In 1924, the Alpine Conservation Park was founded, and Jesenko demarcated part of its borders with his students. He used to spend summers there, studying alpine flora with students and contributing to the area's permanent legal protection, which was only secured in 1981, long after Jesenko's death. He died in the summer of 1932 after a mountaineering accident on the Komarƒça rock face while doing his studies there. With a broken back, he was transferred to a hospital in Ljubljana, where he died on 14 July.

It was built by the British between 1937 and 1938. It is notable as the most important fortification north of the Victoria Lines, and the last major fortification to be built in Malta. Today, it lies in ruins. History Fort Campbell is located on the Selmun peninsula, roughly halfway between Mistra Battery and the ruins of Gƒßajn ƒ¶adid Tower, and facing St Paul's Islands. It was built to protect the approach to both Mellieƒßa Bay and St. Paul's Bay. It also protected British seaplanes which landed in Mistra Bay. The fort took over the role of Wardija Battery, which had been built in 1915. Before construction of the fort began, Governor Charles Bonham-Carter visited the site. Work on the fort probably began in December 1937, and work was hurried after the Munich Agreement of September 1938. The fort was modified throughout the course of World War II, when barracks were built and a radar was installed. It is not known exactly when the fort was decommissioned. After the war, its strategic importance diminished and it was on the verge of being closed by 1949. However, the fort remained in military hands and a watchman remained stationed there until the 1970s. Layout The perimeter wall Fort Campbell is very different from earlier fortifications in Malta, such as the bastioned forts built by the Knights Hospitaller and the polygonal forts built by the British in the 19th century. Due to the new threat of aerial warfare, the fort was surrounded by a thin wall, and the buildings were placed at a distance from each other. Due to this, the fort was camouflaged as from the air it resembled the field walls of the surrounding countryside. Unlike many of the earlier fortifications, Fort Campbell was unadorned. For example, the fort's gateway is just a breach in the perimeter wall defended by a guard room, in contrast with the usually ornate gates of many Hospitaller or Victorian forts. Fort Campbell's design is similar to other fortifications built before and during World War II throughout the British Empire, such as Fort Stanley in Hong Kong, Good Head Battery in New Zealand, Brownstone Battery in Devon, and Fort South Sutor in Scotland. Gun emplacement and gun crew accommodation The fort had two gun emplacements which were armed with 6-inch BL guns. A third gun emplacement may have housed another 6-inch gun or a heavy anti-aircraft gun. In addition, a number of concrete machine gun posts (similar to pillboxes) and rifle loopholes were placed at irregular intervals around the perimeter wall. The buildings in the fort included Battery Observation Post, which served as the command post of the fort and had a gun control room and an underground plotting room. The fort also had direction posts, a water tank, underground magazines, a generator room and rock-hewn bomb shelters. Defence Electric Lights and searchlight emplacements were also built outside the perimeter wall on the shoreline. In 1942, barracks were built outside the fort to house the force of infantry that was stationed in Selmun. Various Nissen and Romney huts were also built inside and outside the fort. Present day Collapsed roof of the gun control room of the Battery Observation Post Since Fort Campbell was decommissioned, it has fallen into a state of neglect and disrepair. It still retains most of its original features, although many rooms are in ruins. The fort was vandalized repeatedly, and in 2004 the fire control position was completely destroyed by vandals. At some point, the iron beams that supported the roof of the barracks were stolen, and due to this some of the blocks have collapsed or are in danger of collapsing. Since the fort is abandoned, it is possible to enter, but parts of it are dangerous to visitors. The mayor of the Mellieƒßa Local Council, Robert Cutajar, is attempting to restore the fort. Until now, the site was never restored since it would be very expensive given the large area of the fort. It has been proposed that the site be rehabilitated as a picnic or camping site. In 2014, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat stated that the government intends to rehabilitate the fort and the surrounding area.

In current studies it has been determined that epiphytic bacteria generally don‚Äôt harm the plant, but promote the formation of ice crystals. Some produce an auxin hormone which promotes plant growth and plays a role in the life cycle of the bacteria. Different bacteria prefer different plants and different plant organs depending on the organ's nutritional content, and depending on the bacteria's colonization system which is controlled by the host plant. Bacteria which live on leaves are referred to as phyllobacteria, and bacteria which live on the root system are referred to as rhizabacteria.

She fought in the Second World War in command of a bomber squadron. Fedutenko was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for her leadership.  Early life  Fedutenko was born in Rakitnoye village (now in Belgorod Oblast). Both her parents worked at a sugar factory. She participated in skiing, skating and horse riding. Fedutenko later worked at the same factory, and continued her education at the factory's apprenticeship school after receiving seven years of incomplete secondary education. In that period, she participated in an aircraft modelling hobby group. She enrolled in the Tambov Civil Aviation Flying School at the age of 18. Between 1935 and 1941, Fedutenko was a civil aviation pilot. By the time of the German invasion she had mastered several aircraft types and her flying time was measured in thousands of hours.  World War II  From June 23, 1941 to October 15, 1941 she flew the Polikarpov R-5 biplane with the Kiev Special Group of the Civil Air Fleet (GVF) ‚Äì an auxiliary unit established by Soviet civil aviation authorities. She flew supply and liaison missions in support of the fighting troops, including the evacuation of 150 wounded soldiers, and the transportation of the Red Army Stavka representatives, among others. During these missions she occasionally had to evade enemy fighter attacks. By December 1942 Fedutenko converted to flying the Petlyakov Pe-2 medium bomber after graduating from training courses at the Engels Military Aviation School for Pilots. From January 1943, she flew combat missions for the 587th Bomber Aviation Regiment, one of the three female combat flying units established by Marina Raskova.. Note: the author was Fedutenko's navigator On May 26, 1943, during the Kuban air battles, Fedutenko received a head wound from an anti- aircraft gun shell fragment just before dropping bombs on heavily defended German artillery positions near the village of Kiyevskoye, Krasnodar Krai. Despite her severe wound, she retained full control of her aircraft and command of her flight, and was able to stay in formation, ensuing the eventual destruction of the target. Fedutenko then conducted a flak evasion maneuver, preventing the loss of aircraft and aircrew in her command. By March 1945 Fedutenko had flown 56 missions on the Pe-2, in 20 of which in she was a flight leader, leading 3 aircraft, in 25 a squadron leader, leading 9 aircraft, and on 2 occasions led a combined division of six squadron V-formations following each other in a column with squadrons drawn from the different regiments of the same division with a total strength of 54 aircraft. In one of these occasions she was not assigned as the leading pilot of the division formation, but when the leader was downed on approaching the target, she took the lead and ensued the successful accomplishment of the mission. Fedutenko's command considered her performance as a pilot and commander to be efficient and instrumental to the destruction of enemy assets. On March 14, 1945, Fedutenko's superior recommended that she be awarded the title of Hero of Soviet Union for \\"the exceptional services she rendered for the Motherland showing valour and heroism\\". She was officially bestowed the title on August 18. In addition, she received the Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Banner (twice), the Order of Patriotic War, First Class, and many medals.  Later life  Fedutenko transferred to the reserve in 1946. Involved in party work in Khabarovsk and Irkutsk until 1954, she moved to Kiev, where she died on January 30, 1978. Fedutenko was buried in the city's Baikove Cemetery.

His monumental sculptures and murals are displayed in public spaces in Portugal and Brazil. His work is held in many public and private collections. Life Jose Maria Figueiredo Sobral was born in Lisbon in 1926. He graduated from the Antonio Arroio Decorative Arts School (Escola Secund√°ria Art√≠stica Ant√≥nio Arroio) where he studied under Lino Ant√≥nio, Paula Campos and Rodrigues Alves. Sobral worked in a range of media including painting, graphic design, illustration, scenography and poetry. His paintings were first shown publicly at the General Exhibitions of Fine Arts (SNBA, Lisbon) immediately after World War II (1939‚Äì45). He joined the Portuguese surrealist group formed by Ant√¥nio Maria Lisboa and Cesariny Vasconcelos. His first individual exhibition was in Castelo de Vide in 1952. Since then his work has been shown in many individual and group exhibitions. Until the late 1950s Sobral worked in creative advertising and a graphic illustration. He also wrote poetry and drama, and worked as a layout designer. He was critical of the regime of Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar, and was arrested several times for political reasons. He took up sculpture in the 1960s, and then ceramics. In 1970 he began to collaborate in making tapestry with the Manufactura de Tape√ßarias de Portalegre. He was a co-founder of the Minotauro publishing house with Urbano Tavares Rodrigues. This company published the Minotauro magazine. In 1975 he moved to Americana, S√£o Paulo, where he created a sculpture for the city entrance at the invitation of former Mayor Ralph Biasi.

He is the author of numerous books and articles including: Isaac Leeser and the Making of American Judaism (1995) and Sharing Sacred Moments (1999), and a co-editor of Reform Judaism in America: A Biographical Dictionary and Sourcebook (1993) and New Essays in American Jewish History (2009). Since 2010 he has also published articles on Judaism and art. Early life, family and education Lance Jonathan Sussman was born in Baltimore, Maryland and raised in suburban Pikesville, Maryland. His father, Charles Sussman (1925‚Äì2010), was awarded a bronze star and other decorations for valor during World War II while serving in the 95th Infantry Division. After the war he was a teacher and an administrator in the Baltimore County Public Schools. His mother, Freda Sacki Sussman, was born in Bamberg, Germany in 1925. She fled Nazi Germany and resettled in the United States in 1938 and her family escaped the following year. Sussman married Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Sussman (n√©e Zeller) on August 6, 1977 in Rye, New York. She has had a career as both a Jewish educator and a music educator. They have five children and two grandchildren. Sussman also has a sister Marcelle who is a journalist. In 1972, Sussman graduated from Pikesville Senior High School where in addition to his academic work, he was President of the Poetry Club. He then attended Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. In 1975, after only three years in college, he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated cum laude with a BA in Religious Studies. While attending Franklin and Marshall, he also studied Hebrew language at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. From 1975 to 1987, Sussman attended Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion (HUC-JIR) in Cincinnati, Ohio. HUC-JIR is the rabbinical seminary for North American Reform Judaism. He received a Masters of Arts in Hebrew Letters in 1979 and was ordained as a Rabbi by HUC-JIR in June, 1980. While studying for his rabbinical degree he was awarded the Mrs. Arthur Hays Sulzberger Prize in Homiletics for the Best Short Sermon. Before his ordination, Sussman was a student rabbi at Beth Boruk Temple, in Richmond, Indiana, where he wrote and published The Emergence of A Jewish Community in Richmond, Indiana (1981). This was Sussman's first published work in American Jewish History and the beginning of his scholarship on the history of Jewish communities in America. After ordination, Sussman remained at HUC-JIR where he earned a Ph.D. in American Jewish History in 1987, studying under Jacob Rader Marcus, the most senior scholar of American Jewish History, and Jonathan D. Sarna, who is currently at Brandeis University. Sussman's dissertation, \\"The Life and Career of Isaac Leeser (1806-1896): A Study of American Judaism in its Formative Period,\\" was later published as Isaac Leeser and the Making of American Judaism (1995). Ironically, Leeser was a leader of the Jewish community in Philadelphia, where Sussman would ultimately spend the bulk of his rabbinical career. In 2005, HUC-JIR awarded Sussman an honorary Doctorate of Divinity. Early career From 1982 to 1986, while writing his doctoral dissertation, Sussman served as the rabbi of Temple Beth Shalom in Middleton, Ohio. In 1987, Sussman joined the faculty of the history department at the State University of New York at Binghamton (SUNY Binghamton), which is now called Binghamton University. He was also a faculty member of the Judaic Studies Department. Sussman remained at SUNY Binghamton until 2001, where he was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure. In 1997‚Äì98, he was the chair of the Judaic Studies Department. From 1990 to 2001 he served as the founding President of Hillel at SUNY Binghamton. In addition, from 1986 to 1990 he served as the rabbi at a Reconstructionist congregation, Temple Beth-El, in Endicott, New York. From 1990 to 2001, in addition to teaching at SUNY Binghamton, he was also the rabbi at the much larger Temple Concord, a Reform congregation, in Binghamton, NY. While at SUNY Binghamton, Sussman taught courses on American Jewish history, modern Jewish history, and world religious history and directed many Ph.D. students. During his years at SUNY Binghamton, Sussman was also a Group Leader for Birthright Israel and the founder of Keshet Press, a not-for-profit company which published books on Jewish history in the southern tier of New York. While in Binghamton, Sussman also developed an exhibit for the University museum on Jewish migration and history in the southern tier of New York titled \\"Beyond the Catskills,\\" and published a communal history by the same name in 1989. In 1995, Sussman created Hanukkah House, a seasonal holiday museum, located in the historic Jonas M. Kilmer House, known as the 'Kilmer Mansion', on the grounds of Temple Concord. Philadelphia career and Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel In 2001, Sussman moved to metropolitan Philadelphia where he accepted the pulpit at Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel (KI), which is the oldest reform congregation in Pennsylvania. KI was founded in 1847 as an orthodox synagogue and became a reform congregation in 1855. It was the fifth reform congregation in the United States. KI is remarkable for the longevity of its rabbis. Sussman is only the eighth senior rabbi in KI's 160 years as a reform congregation. Among his predecessors are three extraordinary figures in American Jewish history. Rabbi David Einhorn (1809‚Äì1879), was the most prominent Jewish abolitionist of the American Civil War era. Einhorn began his American career in Baltimore, where ironically Sussman was raised, but was forced to move to Philadelphia because of his opposition to slavery. During his tenure (1861‚Äì1866) KI became known as \\"The Abolitionist Temple\\". Rabbi Joseph Krauskopf (1858‚Äì1923), founded the National Farm School in 1896 (now Delaware Valley University in Doylestown, Pennsylvania). He later served as a chaplain for American forces under Col. Theodore Roosevelt at the Battle of San Juan Hill during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Rabbi Bertram Wallace Korn (1918‚Äì1979), who as a Rear Admiral in the Chaplain Corps was the first Jewish chaplain to receive flag rank in any of the U.S. armed forces. Like Sussman, Korn was a prominent historian of the American Jewish experience and remembered for his classic study, American Jewry and the Civil War (1951). In 2001 Sussman wrote a scholarly introduction for a 50th anniversary reprinting of this book. In 2019, KI created the Lance J Sussman Rabbinic Chair in honor of his 18th year leading the congregation. Sussman currently holds that chair. Keneseth Israel building on Old York Road, Elkins Park, PA While serving as the senior rabbi at KI, Sussman has also continued to teach at the university level. He has been a visiting professor, adjunct professor, or lecturer at, among others, Princeton University, Temple University, Hunter College (City University of New York), Rutgers University, Gratz College, and the New York City campus of HUC-JIR. Since its founding in 1998, he has been a member of the Academic Advisory and Editorial Board of the Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives at HUC-JIR in Cincinnati, Ohio. He has also served as a trustee of Delaware Valley College (now Delaware Valley University), the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, and the American Jewish Historical Society in New York City. In 2015 he became a member of the Board of Governors of Gratz College, and in July 2019 he became the Chair of the Board of Governors. He has also worked closely with the National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Sussman regularly gives public lectures and presentations and has spoken at, among others, the American Jewish Committee in Berlin, Germany, Jagellonian University in Krak√≥w, Poland, the Gershman YMHA (Young Men's Hebrew Association) Jewish Community Center in Philadelphia, the Center for Jewish History in New York City, the Annual Convention of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the biennial conference of the Union for Reform Judaism, Princeton University, and the National Museum of American Jewish History. He has served as an adviser to numerous public exhibitions at museums and other cultural institutions and been involved with many public television (PBS)programs. Rabbinic Platform of 1998 Between 1998 and 2001, Sussman was active in a national debate among Reform leaders over the direction of the Movement. In 1998 the magazine Reform Judaism published a draft of a new platform for the movement. In May 1999, the annual meeting of the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR), which is the organization of Reform Rabbis in the United States and Canada, debated this platform. In that debate Sussman offered numerous amendments to the proposed platform, many of which were adopted. After it was passed, Sussman publicly remarked, that despite his amendments, the new Platform, \\"doesn‚Äôt really address the religious needs of Reform Judaism at this time.\\" In 2001 Sussman, working with Rabbi Robert M. Seltzer, a professor at Hunter College, City University of New York, responded to the 1999 platform by publishing \\"A Statement of Principles for Reform Judaism As it Approaches its Third Century.\\" This document challenged the leadership of the Reform Movement to develop a more modern and forward thinking of the nature of Reform Judaism. The \\"Statement\\" was initially published in Rabbi Judith S. Lewis's edited volume, Thinking Ahead: Toward the Next Generation of Judaism (2001). It has since appeared on a number of internet sites. In response to the proposed platform in Reform Judaism in 1998 Sussman joined a group of other rabbis in founding the Association for Progressive Judaism. From 2013 to the end of 2018 he served as the national president of that organization. The Seltzer/Sussman \\"Statement\\" asserted that \\"Judaism has always been capable of adapting to unforeseeable situations while preserving its core of symbols and ideals.\\" Grounded in Jewish history, the two Rabbis (who are also historians) argued that Judaism's \\"record of this adaptability and enduring faith\\" needed to be continued into the 21st Century. They declared: \\"We affirm that Judaism offers a spiritual grounding in a cosmic order that evokes in us awe and mystery. We insist that morality is central to Judaism and this cosmic order confers ethical responsibilities on us as beings with the capacity to choose between good and evil. We are convinced that modern historical and scientific knowledge has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the universe, the evolution of religion, and the development of Judaism ‚Äì and that this knowledge calls on us to reexamine our presuppositions in every generation.\\" They emphasized the importance of Reform Judaism in \\"affirming the exemplary power of morally courageous deeds, the sanctity of life, and the possibility of personal transcendence through the apprehension of spiritual beauty.\\" They further argued that modern Judaism should be understood as \\"compatible with reason, historical knowledge, scientific thought, and democratic values.\\" The \\"Statement\\" concluded by reaffirming the \\"uniqueness of the Jewish people\\" and their \\"central role in the spiritual history of humanity.\\" Seltzer and Sussman urged Reform Jewish leaders to \\"recommit\\" the movement to the \\"highest moral and religious values\\" and \\"to the ideals of truthfulness, justice, compassion, and universal peace as envisioned by the prophets ‚Äì humanity‚Äôs best hope in the new age it has entered.\\" Despite Sussman's criticism of the CCAR platform, his Rabbinic colleagues made him the chair of the CCAR Press. In that capacity he also led a special taskforce to oversee the final production of Mishkan T‚ÄôFilah: A Reform Siddur (2007), the new prayer book of the Reform Movement. Academic and popular writing Throughout his career Sussman has been an active scholar, writer, and public speaker. His revised doctoral dissertation, Isaac Leeser and the Making of American Judaism (1995), is the only modern biography of one of the most important American Jewish leaders in the antebellum and civil war eras. Writing in American Jewish History, the major professional specialty journal for this subject, a reviewer noted: \\"This outstanding, full-length monograph by Lance Sussman is by far the most comprehensive work to date and is likely to remain the definitive work on Leeser for many years to come.\\" This scholar noted that Sussman's book was \\"well-researched, utilizing archival sources that hitherto were not consulted, this book is rich with discussion and analysis and includes several episodes not previously brought to light.\\" Similarly, a reviewer in The Journal of American History noted \\"The author's account of Leeser's life fills an important hiatus in American Jewish historiography. His use of primary sources is extensive. The author's very readable text of biography and religious history will please both academician and layman alike.\\" A major tool for librarians, OCLC World Cat, concluded serious libraries should buy the book because \\"The author provides remarkable insight into the early development of organized Jewish life in the United States\\" in \\"a comprehensive work about a long-neglected but central figure\\" of the nineteenth century American Jewish community. Another historian described the book as a \\"major contribution\\" and \\"the most comprehensive study of one of the most important Jewish leaders in pre-Civil War America.\\" Indeed, Isaac Leeser and Sussman's other books have received favorable reviews in major academic journals and on-line resources that cover both U.S. history in general and also Judaic Studies. In addition to his academic scholarship (see publications list below) Sussman is an active public intellectual. He has given talks throughout the United States as well as overseas. He writes for newspapers and online publications as well. For example, in January 2013 Sussman wrote \\"Spielberg's Lincoln and the Jews: An Untold Story\\" for the online publication Jewish Ideas Daily This article was then reprinted in number of Jewish newspapers around the country including The Crescent City Jewish News in New Orleans, the New Jersey Jewish News, and JewishJournal.com. Public service Interfaith work In the early 1990s Sussman worked with the Community Hunger Outreach Warehouse (CHOW) to collect and distribute food in Binghamton NY. CHOW worked with a number of religious organizations to fight hunger in the community. One site of distribution was Temple Concord where Sussman was the rabbi. In 2002, shortly after he arrived in the Philadelphia area, he was the founding president of the Cheltenham Area Multifaith Council (CAMC). Participants included Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, and Jews. After the attack on the World Trade Center (9-11) in 2001 he worked with the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding to promote Jewish- Muslim dialog. With the FFEU he participated in programming at the United States House of Representatives and at the United Nations on promoting Muslim- Jewish understanding. Sussman's picture appeared in an FFUE's full page ad in the New York Times. (April 13, 2008) . In the Philadelphia area he worked with the Peace Islands initiative to foster Muslim-Jewish dialog. (Fetullah Gulen) Gulen Movement. He has also worked with the Thanks-Giving Square Foundation, a Dallas, Texas-based UN NGO that promotes global interfaith understanding through the practice of giving thanks. On March 1, 2001 Sussman gave the opening prayer for a session of the United States House of Representatives. In the wake of the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, Sussman helped run a fund raising effort at KI in cooperation with local Haitian organizations. Social activism Sussman has made trips to the Soviet Union (1987) and Cuba (January 5‚Äì13, 2009) to show solidarity with Jews under totalitarian regimes and to help collect information about Jewish communities in these countries. From 2003 to 2006 Sussman worked with the German government to bring three groups of high school students from Frankfort to stay at homes of Jewish families affiliated with KI and similarly sent three groups of Jewish high school students from KI to Germany. From 2015 until January 2019, Sussman served as a Trustee of the American Board of IsraAID(founded in 2001), an Israeli-based not-for-profit humanitarian aid organization that has been engaged in emergency medical and rescue efforts after disasters such as the earthquake in Haiti, tsunamis in Sri Lanka and Japan, and Syrian refugees in Jordan. Pulpit innovations Sussman has been highly innovative in his pulpit work combining art and high technology both for services and adult education. After studying the history of Jewish Art and publishing a number of historical articles, he began working with his Cantor at Keneseth Israel, to develop \\"Visual T'fillot (prayer), in which entire services including the Hebrew-English liturgy, transliteration, original art and video were combined. Keneseth Israel remodeled its 1,000-seat sanctuary to accommodate the new technological needs, a project requiring nearly one million dollars to complete. Sussman also developed a similar approach to Adult Education in the sanctuary by collaborating with a local digital artist, Joan Myerson Shrager. Together, they produced 90 lectures on Jewish Art and history between 2010 and 2015. For the synagogue's Preschool, Sussman created the (Avenue Q-size) KI Puppets. Sussman commissioned Philadelphia based theater set designer, Glen Lash, to produce the puppets and a New York City commercial songwriter, Paul Suchow, to compose the puppet songs.

He was a moderate performer on the flat, winning one minor event in eleven attempts, but showed improved form when tried over hurdles despite recurring injury problems. In his first season over obstacles he won two novice races and finished third in the Sun Alliance Novices' Hurdle. In the following season he won the Lonesome Glory Hurdle and recorded his most important victory when winning the Stayers' Hurdle at odds of 20/1. He also produced several good performances under big weights in handicap races and won his only race over fences before leg injuries ended his racing career. Background Karshi was a dark-coated bay gelding with no white markings bred in the United Kingdom by his owner Samuel Vestey, 3rd Baron Vestey. He was sired by Persian Bold whose wins included the Richmond Stakes and the Horris Hill Stakes in 1977. As a breeding stallion he was primarily known as a sire of flat race horses including Kooyonga, Bold Pilot, Pennine Walk (Queen Anne Stakes) and Persian Heights (St James's Palace Stakes). Kasrhi's dam Kashmiri Snow won one race and was a granddaughter of Lorenzaccio's half-sister Toast Record. Karshi was a nervous, excitable horse who was described as being \\"a nightmare to train\\". Vestey initially sent the horse into training with James Fanshawe at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career Flat racing career Karshi ran five times as a three-year-old in 1993 without managing to win a race. After finishing third in the Wood Ditton Stakes over a mile at Newmarket Racecourse on his debut in April, he finished unplaced in his next two races before finishing second in minor events at Sandown and Leicester. In the following year he was placed in long distance handicap races at Salisbury and York before winning a race at the ninth attempt, when he took a maiden race at Catterick Racecourse by twelve lengths at odds of 2/9. On his last two appearances on the flat he was beaten in a two-runner race at Newmarket and finished fourth in the Cecil Frail Handicap at Haydock Park. At the end of his flat racing career, Karshi was gelded and transferred to the stable of Henrietta Knight at West Lockinge in Oxfordshire. 1995/1996 National Hunt season: novice hurdle races Fourteen months after his last race, Karshi made his debut over obstacles in a Novice hurdle over two miles at Warwick Racecourse on 16 November 1995. Ridden by Jason Titley he led from the start and won by four lengths from Sir Leonard. He finished fifth in a hurdle at Leicester two weeks later before reappearing at Kempton Park Racecourse in January in which he was matched against River North, a top-class flat horse whose wins included the Aral-Pokal. Ridden by Jamie Osborne, Karshi was always among the leaders before overtaking River North on the run-in and won by one and a quarter lengths. In March 1996, Karshi made his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival where he started at odds of 14/1 for the Sun Alliance Novices' Hurdle. Ridden by Titley, he recovered from a jumping mistake at the last hurdle to finish third behind Urubande and Go-Informal, beaten less than two lengths by the winner. On his final appearance of the season he was pulled up in the Champion Novice Hurdle at Punchestown Racecourse in April. 1996/1997 National Hunt season On his first of the 1996/1997 National Hunt season, Karshi carried top weight in a handicap hurdle at Warwick in November and finished second to Balanak to whom he was conceding twenty-four pounds. In December he started 11/8 favourite for the Lonesome Glory Hurdle, a leg of the Sport of Kings Challenge series which was intended to promote competition between British and North American steeplechasers. Ridden by Osborne, he led for most of the way but overtaken by Mandy's Mantino on the run-in before rallying to regain the lead and win by four lengths. The American representative Serenity Prayer was fourteen lengths back in third place. Karshi's next race was a minor handicap hurdle over two miles five furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in February when he finished third to Copper Boy, conceding twenty-three pounds to the winner. On 13 March at the Cheltenham Festival Karshi started at odds of 20/1 for the 26th running of the Stayers' Hurdle in a field which included Escartefigue, What A Question (Long Distance Hurdle), Urubande, Trainglot (Cesarewitch Handicap), Ocean Hawk (Long Walk Hurdle), Pridwell, Derrymoyle (Tipperkevin Hurdle) and Anzum. Ridden by Osborne, he was among the leaders from the start before losing his position three hurdles from the finish as Escartefigue and Paddy's Return opened up a clear advantage over the other runners. Karshi rallied to move up between Paddy's Return and Escartefigue approaching the final hurdle, took the lead and was driven clear on the run-in to win by two and a half lengths from the fast finishing Anzum. 1997/1998 National Hunt season After a nine-month absence, Karshi returned for a handicap hurdle at Doncaster Racecourse on 13 December in which he carried top weight of 168 pounds and finished third behind New Inn and Star Rage. Jim Culloty took over the ride on Karshi when he again carried 168 pounds and finished third to the Jenny Pitman-trained Princeful who was carrying twenty-eight pounds less. Princeful won the Stayers' Hurdle at two and a half months later. Karshi started 7/4 favourite for the Grade 1 Cleeve Hurdle at Cheltenham on 31 January but after leading for most of the way he tired in the closing stages and finished last of the five runners behind the mare Mistinguett. After the race, Karshi was found to have sustained a fracture to the pastern bone of his right foreleg and did not race again that season. In October 1998, after a further nine-month absence, Karshi made his debut over fences in a novice chase at Exeter Racecourse. Starting the 11/4 second choice in the betting, he took the lead two fences out and won by eight lengths from Ocean Hawk. Karshi aggravated his old leg injury in the race and Knight explained \\"Over the past few years, he's had three separate hairline fractures of the leg. I'm afraid it's nothing that can be operated on. It's just a case of resting him and hoping to get him back for next season\\". Karshi never recovered and did not race again.

Over time, several members of the Anson family were made knights, baronets and peers. Hereditary titles held by the Anson family include the earldom of Lichfield (since 1831) and the Anson baronetcy (also since 1831). Over time, several members of the family have risen to prominence, including Admiral of the Fleet George Anson, 1st Baron Anson, PC, FRS (1697‚Äì1762) and the society photographer Patrick Anson, 5th Earl of Lichfield (1939‚Äì2005). History Portrait of Admiral of the Fleet George Anson, 1st Baron Anson (1697‚Äì1762), by Thomas Hudson Portrait of Thomas Anson, 1st Earl of Lichfield (1795‚Äì1854). Shugborough Hall Colwich Anson family graves at St Stephen's Church, Great Haywood The Anson family is descended from George Anson (1731-1789), a Member of Parliament for Lichfield from 1770 to 1789. Born George Adams, he was the son of Sambrooke Adams and his wife Janette Anson, sister of the famous naval commander Admiral Lord Anson. In 1773, on the death of his uncle Thomas Anson, a brother of Admiral Lord Anson, he succeeded to the substantial estates accumulated by his uncles, including Shugborough Hall in Staffordshire. The same year George Adams assumed by Royal Licence the surname of Anson in lieu of Adams. In 1831, two of his sons would be elevated to hereditary titles: his eldest son, Thomas, would be made a viscount, while the latter's brother, William, would be made a baronet (see Anson Baronets). George Anson's aforementioned eldest son was Thomas Anson, 1st Viscount Anson (1767‚Äì1818), who represented Lichfield in the House of Commons as a Whig from 1789 to 1806 until he was raised to the peerage on 17 February 1806 as Baron Soberton, of Soberton in the County of Southampton, and Viscount Anson, of Shugborough and Orgreave in the County of Stafford, both in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his eldest son Thomas (1795‚Äì1854), who became the 2nd Viscount. He was a landowner and Whig politician who served as Master of the Buckhounds from 1830 to 1834 and as Postmaster General from 1835 to 1841. In 1831 the 2nd Viscount Anson was created Earl of Lichfield, of Lichfield in the County of Stafford, in William IV's coronation honours. This was the third creation of the title of Earl of Lichfield, but the first in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The titles associated with the earldom of Lichfield continued to descend from father to son until the death of the 4th Earl in 1960. He was succeeded by his grandson, the 5th Earl, the only son of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas William Arnold Anson, Viscount Anson (1913‚Äì1958), eldest son of the 4th Earl. Known professionally as Patrick Lichfield, he was a successful photographer. the titles are held by the 6th Earl, only son of the 5th Earl and Lady Leonora Grosvenor, daughter of the 5th Duke of Westminster. He succeeded as the 6th Earl of Lichfield upon his father's death on 11 November 2005. The 6th Earl married in December 2009 Lady Henrietta Conyngham, daughter of Henry Conyngham, 8th Marquess Conyngham.The Times announcement They have one son, Thomas Ossian Patrick Wolfe Anson, Viscount Anson (b. 20 May 2011).

The trust serves more than 350,000 people living in the London boroughs of Enfield and Haringey, as well as the nearby boroughs of Barnet and Waltham Forest. It works closely with the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust but the board voted against full membership of the Royal Free London group in October 2018. In May 2018 the trust banned the 444 and 491 buses from the northern perimeter road because cars were following buses through an automatic barrier. The Enfield Transport User Group made a formal complaint about the lack of a risk assessment and the problems caused for patients who rely on public transport. Staffing Maria Kane is the chief executive. Elizabeth McManus resigned in 2017. The trust has had serious problems with its accident and emergency service failing to meet the Four Hour Emergency Target since 2016, and so had difficulty recruiting senior staff. The General Medical Council and Health Education England considered removing junior doctors from the A&E.; It had the poorest A&E; waiting times in London with only seven of the 15 consultant posts and seven of 13 middle-grade emergency posts filled. In October 2018 it succeeded in recruiting a substantive chief operating officer from Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust and Emma Whicher, NHS Improvement‚Äôs London medical director to be its medical director. Performance The Care Quality Commission reported some improvements in the accident and emergency department after an inspection in September 2016 after earlier rating it as inadequate, but still noted nurse staffing shortages, inadequate checks on agency staff and a poor culture, especially in the maternity unit. In December 2017 it was reported that during two weeks of data collection it had not had one day with any of its 460 beds unoccupied. It ending the year 2017/8 with a ¬£29 million deficit. It has considered appealing to Tottenham Hotspur, with which it has an established relationship, for financial help. It was suggested that a 20p surcharge on food, drink and match programmes for fans attending home matches could raise around ¬£300,000 a year. There were 81 serious incidents reported by the trust in 2016-17 and 88 in 2017-18. Healthwatch Enfield reported in March 2018 that 75% of the patients who attended the A&E; department had not attempted to make a GP appointment. The trust has a GP-led urgent care centre but many patients preferred the A&E; department because of the availability of X-ray, CT and MRI scans and blood tests.

The building was originally part of Cornell's Sibley College of Mechanical Engineering and the Mechanic Arts and housed the college's machine shop, pattern shop, and electrical laboratory. Buckminster Fuller By the early 1950s, Cornell's Department of Architecture had moved from Morse, Franklin and White Halls to Sibley and Rand. In 1954 visiting critic Buckminster Fuller built a 20-foot diameter geodesic dome on the roof of Rand which was intended to be permanent. However, vandals destroyed the dome on Halloween night. In 1959, Rand's first floor was the home to the Cornell Computer Center. In 1968 the first floor of Rand Hall was renovated and the second floor housed the Center for Research in Education. A second stairway was added to the building to comply with fire codes.

Sign promoting a 24/7 crisis text line on the Golden Gate Bridge Golden Gate Bridge as seen from below Between 1937 and 2012, an estimated 1,400 bodies were recovered of people who had jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge, located in the San Francisco Bay Area in the United States. The four- second fall from the Golden Gate Bridge sends a person plunging at to hit the waters of the San Francisco Bay \\"with the force of a speeding truck meeting a concrete building.\\" Jumping off the bridge holds at least a 98 percent fatality rate; and it is speculated the fatality rate is actually higher than 98% because of people whose bodies are never found after they make the jump. , it is estimated that 34 people have survived after jumping. Some die instantly from internal injuries, while others drown or die of hypothermia. The Golden Gate bridge's death toll has since been surpassed only by that of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge in China. In 2013, 118 potential jumpers were talked down from their attempt and did not jump. A number of measures are in place to discourage people from jumping, including telephone hotlines and patrols by emergency personnel and bridge workers. Although it had previously been considered impractical to build a suicide barrier, in 2014, the Bridge's directors approved a proposal for a net below the bridge's deck, extending out either side, rather than side barriers at the railings as had long been proposed. Background Suicides mapped by location, as of 2005 Official count of the jumpers ended 1995 on 997. The Golden Gate Bridge, referred to by Krista Tippett as a \\"suicide magnet\\", is the second-most used suicide site/suicide bridge in the world, after the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge (see List of suicide sites). The deck is about above the water. \\"Depth to span ratio (of truss is) 1:168.\\" Span of 4200 ft means truss is 25 ft deep. After a fall of four seconds, jumpers hit the water at around 75 mph (120 km/h). Most of the jumpers die due to impact trauma. About 5% of the jumpers survive the initial impact but generally drown or die of hypothermia in the cold water. Most suicidal jumps from the bridge have occurred on the side facing the bay. The side facing the Pacific is closed to pedestrians. An official suicide count was kept until the year 1995, sorted according to which of the bridge's 128 lamp posts the jumper was nearest when he or she jumped. The official count ended on June 5, 1995 on the 997th jump; jumper No. 1000, Eric Atkinson (25), jumped on July 3, 1995. Earlier in 1995, a local shock jock had offered a case of Snapple to the family of the 1000th suicide victim. Consequently, Marin County coroner Ken Holmes asked local media to stop reporting the total number of jumpers. By 2012 the unofficial count exceeded 1,600 (in which the body was recovered or someone saw the jump) and new suicides were occurring about once every two weeks, according to a San Francisco Chronicle analysis. The most suicides in one month were in August 2013, when 10 jumped. The total count for the year 2013 was 46, with an additional 118 attempts prevented, making it the year with the highest tally so far. The rate of incidence of attempts has risen to nearly one every other day. The youngest known jumper is 5-year-old Marilyn DeMont; in 1945, she was told to jump by her father who followed her. For comparison, the reported third-most popular place to commit suicide in the world, Aokigahara Forest in Japan, has a record of 108 bodies, found within the forest in 2004, with an average of 30 a year. There were 34 bridge-jump suicides in 2006 whose bodies were recovered, in addition to four jumps that were witnessed but whose bodies were never recovered, and several bodies recovered suspected to be from bridge jumps. The California Highway Patrol removed 70 apparently suicidal people from the bridge that year. There is no accurate figure on the number of suicides or completed jumps since 1937, because many were not witnessed. People have been known to travel to San Francisco specifically to jump off the bridge, and may take a bus or cab to the site; police sometimes find abandoned rental cars in the parking lot. Currents beneath the bridge are strong and some jumpers have more than likely been washed out to sea without being seen. The height, depth, and length of the span from end to end, looking west. The fatality rate of jumping is roughly 98%. As of July 2013, only 34 people are known to have survived the jump. Those who do survive strike the water feet-first and at a slight angle, although individuals may still sustain broken bones or internal injuries. One young woman, Sarah Rutledge Birnbaum, survived, but returned to jump again and died the second time. One young man survived a jump in 1979, swam to shore, and drove himself to a hospital. The impact cracked several of his vertebrae. Engineering professor Natalie Jeremijenko, as part of her \\"Bureau of Inverse Technology\\" art collective, created a \\"Despondency Index\\" by correlating the Dow Jones Industrial Average with the number of jumpers detected by \\"Suicide Boxes\\" containing motion-detecting cameras, which she claimed to have set up under the bridge. The boxes purportedly recorded 17 jumps in three months, far greater than the official count. The Whitney Museum, although questioning whether Jeremijenko's suicide-detection technology actually existed, nevertheless included her project in its prestigious Whitney Biennial. Incidents Harold B. Wobber The first known intentional death from the Golden Gate Bridge occurred when the bridge was just a little over three months past its opening. In August 1937, 47-year-old World War I veteran Harold Wobber was employed as a bargeman and took a bus to the bridge. After he got off the bus, Wobber started down the pedestrian walkway of the 1.6-mile span. On the way, he started talking to a college professor from Connecticut, on vacation in the San Francisco area. During the stroll, Wobber took off his coat and vest, threw them to the man, and declared, \\"This is where I get off. I'm going to jump.\\" The vacationing professor grabbed the man's belt, but Wobber was able to get free and jumped over the four foot high rail to his death in the San Francisco Bay. After his death, newspapers reported Wobber was \\"a victim of shell shock\\" who had been undergoing mental health treatment. Newspaper clipping from the San Francisco Examiner of the youngest jumper, Marilyn DeMont (5) August and Marilyn DeMont Until 1993, the youngest death off the bridge was 5-year old Marilyn DeMont, in 1945. With the child standing on a girder just outside the bridge's railing, her father, 37-year- old elevator installation foreman August DeMont, commanded her to jump. August DeMont followed by diving \\"gracefully\\" after her. A simple note was found in the DeMont car stating, \\"I and my daughter have committed suicide.\\" Charles S. Gallagher, Sr. and Jr. In 1954, Charles S. Gallagher, Sr. was director of the San Jose Merchants Association in San Jose, California. After returning from two weeks of vacation, he discovered the audit his company began before he left was ongoing. Gallagher told his co-workers he was leaving briefly to get coffee. Rather than doing so, he drove to the north side of the Golden Gate Bridge, parked, and jumped. Four days later, Gallagher's 24-year-old son, Charles S. Gallagher Jr., drove the same sedan owned by his father to the same area and jumped from approximately the same location. A pre-med student at UCLA, Gallagher, Jr. left a note that said, \\"I am sorry. . . . I want to keep dad company.\\" Marc Salinger Twenty-eight-year-old Marc Salinger, oldest son of former Kennedy Administration press secretary Pierre Salinger, jumped to his death from the bridge on February 9, 1977. While Salinger had known John F. Kennedy through his father's professional association with the president, he had also known him on a personal level. According to his family, Salinger, who had occasionally been Kennedy's golf caddy, never got over the president's assassination. After Salinger's mother had identified the body, the San Francisco Coroner's Office announced Salinger's death to the press. A resident of the San Francisco Bay Area at the time of his death, Salinger was buried in San Mateo County. Steven and Kellie Page On January 28, 1993, Steven Page murdered his wife Nancy and then threw his daughter Kellie off the Golden Gate Bridge, before jumping off the bridge himself. Page worked as a buyer at Owaga-Mune Nursery in Fremont, California. The Page family home was in Fremont, but Page maintained a separate apartment after he and his wife separated. At 10:00 am on January 28, Page drove to their Fremont house and murdered his wife with a 12 gauge shotgun. He then left a message for his mother-in-law to pick up his 9-year-old stepson from school. After arriving at the Page home, she discovered the body of her daughter. Page, after killing his wife, drove with their 3-year-old daughter, Kellie, to the Golden Gate Bridge. Highway patrol officers noticed Page walking along the bridge carrying a bundle and recognized it to be a small child. After being approached by the officers because of his unusual behavior, Page threw Kellie over the railing, then climbed over the railing himself and jumped off. Following the incident, investigators were puzzled by Page's apparent lack of psychological indicators prior to the murder/suicide. U.S. Coast Guard spokesperson Shelly Freier stated the USCG had recovered the bodies of both father and daughter by the next day, January 29. An apology letter addressed to Page's 9-year-old stepson, who was at school at the time of all three deaths, was found at the family home. In the letter Page apologized for what he had done, showing premeditation for both the murders of his wife and daughter as well as his suicide. Roy Raymond On August 26, 1993, Roy Raymond, the founder of Victoria's Secret, died after intentionally jumping off of the Golden Gate Bridge at the age of 46. Last seen walking toward the bridge, Raymond's body was shortly thereafter washed up on a shoreline in Marin County; investigators concluded that he had committed suicide by jumping from the bridge. Paul Aladdin Alarab Originally surviving a fall from the Golden Gate in 1988, Paul Aladdin Alarab died on March 19, 2003, when he jumped from the bridge in protest of the United States' invasion of Iraq. Alarab, whose father was born in Iraq, was a 44-year-old real estate agent from Kensington, California, who climbed over a railing on the east side of the bridge, mid-span. Tying one end of a rope to the bridge and wrapping the other end of the rope around his arms, Alarab then demanded to talk to media. Law enforcement tried to talk him back over the railing while he read a statement he had written denouncing the war started earlier that day. After finishing the statement, he let go of the rope and fell 235 feet to the water. His body was recovered almost immediately, but Alarab did not survive the fall. In 1988, however, he had survived a similar fall from the bridge that occurred while lowering himself into a garbage can that was hanging from a 60-foot rope off the bridge. At that time, he was protesting what he saw as mistreatment of the elderly and the handicapped. In the 1988 incident, he lost his grip on the rope and fell into San Francisco Bay, surviving with three broken ribs and both lungs collapsed. The first incident was considered an accident. Following the 1988 incident, Alarab told a reporter from the San Francisco Chronicle, \\"It seemed like the fall lasted forever. I was praying for God to give me another chance. I was also wondering about how I would hit, because that is what determines if you will live or die.\\" While his friends, family, and co-workers did not believe his death was an intentional suicide, investigators came to a different conclusion based on his having let go of the rope. Retired UCSF professor of psychiatry Jerome Motto stated that Alarab might have been disturbed by the outbreak of the war and \\"that previously bearable pain suddenly became intolerable\\". Gene Sprague On May 11, 2004, Gene Sprague,Gene Romal Allen ‚ÄúFlower‚Äù Sprague Find a grave a native of San Mateo, California, committed suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. His death is documented in the 2006 film The Bridge. During the filming of The Bridge, the crew noticed Sprague walking back and forth along the bridge for around 90 minutes, before stopping to lean over the railing. According to Eric Steel, the film's director, Sprague's behavior was normal enough to not attract the attention of the on-set suicide prevention teams. As seen in the end of the film, after watching the water for a minute or two, Sprague pulled himself over the railing, stood up and fell backwards into the San Francisco Bay. Sean Moylan On June 5, 2014, at 4:22 pm, 27-year-old Sean Moylan of Novato, California, jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge, ending his life. The Coast Guard pulled Moylan's body out of the waters beneath the bridge. Moylan was the grandson of John Moylan, a longtime member of the Golden Gate District board of directors who campaigned for the installation of suicide barriers on the bridge. The elder Moylan was president of the board when, in 2008, a historic decision was made to build the barrier at a cost of $68 million. John Moylan referred to his grandson's death as \\"heartbreaking\\"; however, he did not blame it on the lack of a barrier. Sean Moylan already had attempted suicide in February 2014; after a breakup with his girlfriend, Moylan walked in front of a truck in Oregon and was critically injured. Casey Joanna Brooks On January 29, 2008, 17-year-old Casey Brooks of Tiburon, jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge.https://parentingandattachment.com Because her body was never recovered, her friend had benches installed as a memorial. Located on Strawberry Vista in Mill Valley amidst spectacular views, there is some interesting history with the memorial in that the original had to be replaced due to a dispute with the nearby property owner being uncomfortable.https://www.marinij.com/2015/12/19/brawl-over-bench-honoring- suicide-victim-jolts-strawberry/ In March and April 2020, the benches were vandalized twice.https://www.marinij.com/2020/05/03/marin-parents-vexed-by- vandalism-at-daughters- memorial/?fbclid=IwAR3IXdLgMaeSci3AK4A-2s4MbXUqCR6XsC_W0pyTGJTWCzh-RmEmibZE80Q John Brooks has written a book, The Girl Behind the Door, on their experience and journey of losing Casey.https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-girl-behind- the-door-john-brooks/1122340752?ean=9781501128363 False suicides/survivors Along with confirmed suicide deaths and suicide attempts at the bridge, there have been false suicides, as well. The first documented case of \\"pseudocide\\" at the Golden Gate Bridge was in 1948. 47-year old Chris J. Christensen was a well-known local jeweler who had been recently elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Christensen's coat was found attached to a work box at the center span of the bridge with a note in the coat that read, \\"Loved Ones: My nerves are shot. Please forgive me. Chris.\\" Believed to have jumped from the bridge, Christensen was declared dead and rumors abounded. Investigators concluded he was unable to cope with the pressures of being in public office. There were reports of Christensen having become friendly with a man described as \\"willowy ... almost too good-looking to be considered handsome.\\" While Christensen introduced the man to friends and colleagues as his nephew, it was learned the man was not a relative, rather, a Navy sailor whom Christensen met in a Los Angeles bar. Over a year had passed when it was discovered Christensen was actually alive and selling Bibles in Houston, Texas. Found living in a low-rent rooming house and having lost 40 pounds, Christensen explained that campaign contributors who supported his election had asked him to \\"do things he couldn't do\\". Christensen saw himself as a failure and never returned to San Francisco. In 1985 28-year-old Kenneth Baldwin jumped over and survived. Rescued by the US Coast Guard, he suffered a few broken ribs and a bruised lung. On September 24, 2000, Kevin Hines was 19 years old, paranoid, and hallucinating when he jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge. Throwing himself headfirst over the bridge railing, he fell 220 feet into San Francisco Bay. During the fall, his body rotated so that when Hines hit the water he landed in a sitting position, taking the impact in his legs and up through his back. Three of his vertebrae were shattered, lacerating his lower internal organs. A United States Coast Guard vessel rescued him, and he was transported to a hospital in San Francisco where he received emergency surgery. Following further, experimental surgery, any physical evidence of his experience is almost non-existent, and Hines has full mobility. Regarding his thoughts after the jump, Hines stated, \\"There was a millisecond of free fall. In that instant, I thought, what have I just done? I don't want to die. God, please save me.\\" Following his suicide attempt, Hines received some notoriety as a survivor, appearing in a documentary film, The Bridge (2006) and being interviewed on CNN by Larry King. Additionally, he wrote a book about his experience before and after his suicide attempt, Cracked, Not Broken, and became a mental health advocate as well as a proponent for a bridge suicide barrier or net to prevent such incidents. On March 10, 2011, 17-year-old Luhe \\"Otter\\" Vilagomez from Windsor High School in Windsor, California, survived a jump from the bridge, breaking his coccyx and puncturing one lung, though he said his attempt was for \\"fun\\" and not suicide. The teen was helped to shore by Frederic Lecouturier, 55, who was surfing under the bridge when he saw Vilagomez jump. The California Highway Patrol recommended the San Francisco District Attorney's Office charge the student with misdemeanor trespassing (a charge that entails climbing any rail, cable, suspender rope, tower or superstructure not intended for public use), punishable by up to a year in the county jail and/or a fine up to $10,000, and that the teen undergo a medical/psychiatric evaluation by medical professionals. Prevention and intervention Various methods have been tried to reduce the number of suicides. The bridge is fitted with suicide-hotline telephones and staff patrol the bridge in carts, looking for people who appear to be planning to jump. The bridge is now closed to pedestrians at night. Cyclists are still permitted across at night, but can buzz themselves in and out through the remotely controlled security gates. Attempts to introduce a suicide barrier have been thwarted by engineering difficulties, high costs, and public opposition. One recurring proposal had been to build a barrier to replace or augment the low railing, a component of the bridge's original architectural design, as amended by the second designer in the final blueprint.The original design was for a 5 1/2 foot high fence, but it was reduced to 4 feet. Tad Friend: Jumpers: The fatal grandeur of the Golden Gate Bridge, The New Yorker, October 13, 2003 v79 i30 page 3 New barriers have eliminated suicides at other landmarks around the world, but were opposed for the Golden Gate Bridge for reasons of cost, aesthetics, and safety, as the load from a poorly designed barrier could significantly affect the bridge's structural integrity during a strong windstorm. Despite these concerns, on June 27, 2014, California approved a funding plan to install a suicide barrier. A volunteer group called the Bridgewatch Angels was founded by Pleasanton Police Lieutenant, Mia Munayer, in 2011. During every major holiday and while off duty, Munayer mobilizes hundreds of volunteers to patrol the bridge looking for anyone who may be contemplating suicide. Before embarking on their morning or afternoon shifts, Bridgewatch Angels volunteers receive training on the warning signs of someone in crisis, indirect and direct ways to engage with people walking alone on the bridge, and safety protocol when interacting with a suicidal person requiring police intervention. Each Bridgewatch event is dedicated to the memory of a person who jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge and their family joins the Bridgewatch Angels as they walk together to honor the memory of their loved one. The Bridgewatch Angels are credited with making dozens of interventions each year. Suicide rescue In addition to Golden Gate bridge patrol, law enforcement, and emergency medical personnel, there are Golden Gate Bridge ironworkers who volunteer their time to prevent suicides by talking to or wrestling down suicidal people. One of the ironworkers, Ken Hopper, began working at the bridge in the mid-1980s and sees the volunteer rescue duty as \\"part of the job\\". Called \\"Cowboys of the Sky\\", they have the equipment and knowledge of the bridge, as well as the experience working at extreme heights, giving them the qualifications to go over the rail and assist those in need. While the experience of the volunteers minimize the danger of falling, there are still risks encountered. Ironworkers have reported knives being pulled on them, seeing loaded guns on would-be jumpers, and having been bitten. When a police psychologist is on scene, they will coach the volunteer rescuers by radio and the ironworkers are provided seminars on suicide prevention. As of 2001, Hopper reported having rescued 30 suicidal individuals and losing two. He was a first-hand witness to the Steven Page murder/suicide, where a young, distraught father, who had just murdered his wife, threw his toddler-daughter off the bridge and then jumped off the bridge himself. \\"Hopper's Hands\\", hand silhouettes of bridge ironworker and volunteer suicide rescue worker, Ken Hopper \\"Hopper's Hands\\" were created in part as a legacy of the ironworkers volunteering for suicide rescue duty. After Hopper spotted waterfront joggers touching the fence at the sidewalk dead-end near Fort Point before turning back, he asked the bridge's sign painter to create a sign with two hand print silhouettes on it. The signs are now at both ends of the bridge. Strong appeals for a suicide barrier, fence, or other preventive measures were raised again by a well-organized vocal minority of psychiatry professionals, suicide barrier consultants, and families of jumpers beginning in January 2005. These efforts were given momentum by two films dealing with the topic of suicide and the Golden Gate Bridge. On January 14, 2005 the San Francisco Chronicle published an open letter by writer-director Jenni Olson calling for a suicide barrier on the Golden Gate Bridge. The letter was, in part, an excerpt from the script of her film The Joy of Life, which world- premiered the following week, on January 20, 2005, at the Sundance Film Festival. The day before, on January 19, 2005, the Chronicle broke the news that filmmaker Eric Steel had been shooting suicide leaps from the bridge during 2004 for his film The Bridge, which would be released in 2006. A week later, The Joy of Life world-premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and video copies of the film were circulated to members of the Bridge District board of directors with the help of the Psychiatric Foundation of Northern California. In the fall of 2005 the San Francisco Chronicle published a seven-part series of articles, titled \\"Lethal Beauty\\", focusing on the problem of suicide and the Golden Gate Bridge and emphasizing that a solution was not just possible, but even desirable. California Highway patrolman Kevin Briggs, is credited with saving hundreds of lives of would-be jumpers by talking to them before they can take the plunge. The CHP estimates that with the help of cameras and the volunteers at least 80‚Äì90% of people intending to jump are prevented from doing so. Suicide barrier Representative Nancy Pelosi joins the families of Golden Gate Bridge suicide victims in 2017 to celebrate the construction of a suicide-prevention barrier on the bridge On October 10, 2008, the Golden Gate Bridge and Transportation District Board of Directors voted 15 to 1 for the preferred option of installing a plastic-covered stainless-steel net below the bridge as a suicide deterrent. The netting barrier was initially estimated to cost $40‚Äì50 million to complete. On July 28, 2010, the board received $5 million from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) towards conducting a final design study of the barrier. However, a funding source for the overall project still had not been identified, and there was concern that this lack of funding could delay the net's deployment. The lack of funding for the project continued to delay the schedule of completion.Dudnick, Laura (February 24, 2010). \\"Survivors Of Golden Gate Bridge Suicide Victims Rally At City Hall To Demand A Safety Net\\". Bay City News In 2012, President Barack Obama enacted the Transportation Re-authorization Bill permitting federal funding towards transportation infrastructure projects. Initially, the bill didn't divert funding automatically. However, advocates of the barrier, such as 'Bridge Rail Foundation', were eventually successful in securing support for the project in 2014.Prado, Mark (July 6, 2012). \\"Transportation bill makes Golden Gate Bridge suicide barrier eligible for federal dollars\\". Marin Independent Journal. In March 2014, The New York Times reported that it is expected that the directors of the Bridge District will vote to change its policy and allow the use of toll money to supplement governmental funds for a suicide barrier. Installation of the suicide barriers, February 2020 The proposed suicide barrier will consist of stainless steel netting stretching out on either side of the bridge, and 20 feet below the bridge. Funding for building this barrier was unanimously approved by the Golden Gate Bridge Board of Directors on June 27, 2014. The MTC approved to contribute $27 million of the $76-million overall cost for the project, and federal, state, and local authorities will likewise contribute to the project.Prado, Mark (July 23, 2014). \\"Largest funding piece for Golden Gate Bridge suicide barrier gets approval\\". Marin Independent Journal The design was finalized in December 2014; however the project has been delayed due to concerns from the National Park Service about storing construction materials at the site for the estimated 3 years it will take to complete the work. Fabrication of the stainless-steel netting and structural pieces began offsite in May 2017 after years of debate and installation of the netting on-site began in August 2018. The netting is scheduled to be complete in 2021 at a projected cost of $211 million. Film documentaries The Bridge The Bridge is a 2006 British- American documentary film by Eric Steel, which spans 365 days of filming at the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge in 2004. The film captured a number of suicides, and featured interviews with family and friends of some of the identified people who had thrown themselves from the bridge that year. The film was inspired by Tad Friend's 2003 article titled \\"Jumpers\\", written for The New Yorker magazine. The film crew shot almost 10,000 hours of footage, recording 23 of the known 24 suicides off the bridge in 2004. In his article for The New Yorker, Friend wrote, \\"Survivors often regret their decision in midair, if not before\\". This observation is supported by survivor Ken Baldwin, who explained, \\"I instantly realized that everything in my life that I'd thought was unfixable was totally fixable‚Äîexcept for having just jumped.\\" The 2006 release of The Bridge exerted additional pressure on the Bridge District and created continued public awareness. The film also documented interviews with surviving family members of those who jumped, with witnesses, and with a survivor. The Joy of Life The Joy of Life, released in 2005, is an American documentary film that recounts the chronological history of suicide at the Golden Gate Bridge. The film discusses key design changes made to the bridge by architect Irving Morrow, notably the lowering of the pedestrian railing. It also explores the public discussions of the problem of suicide prevention over the decades, with a focus on local news coverage.
