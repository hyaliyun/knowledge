Built in 1815 and enlarged c. 1900 and 1920, the property is historically significant for its association with John Peters, one of the first proprietors of Blue Hill, who arrived in the region in 1765, and was a prominent figure in local political and economic life for many years. His house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983; after serving for a time in the 20th century as an inn, it is now available for rent as an event venue. Description and history The Peters House is set at the center of what is now called Peters Point, off Steamboat Wharf Road east of the main village of Blue Hill. The house is a 2-1/2 story structure, with a side gable roof. Its main block has brick walls on three sides, and wood frame sections to the northeast and southwest at the gables. The block has twin chimneys at the sides, and a five-bay facade with a front entry that has a simple Greek Revival surround with sidelight windows and pilasters. The front is sheltered by an oversized two-story portico supported by fluted columns, which was added c. 1900. A sunporch, built about the same time, was attached to the left side of the main block. To the rear of the main block and sunporch is a two-story wood frame ell, from which a second brick ell extends further to the left. and John Peters, a native of Andover, Massachusetts, arrived in the Blue Hill area in 1765, and was one of its first proprietors, owning more than of land in the area. He served as Blue Hill's town clerk and in other civic roles, and was a land surveyor and land agent for Philadelphia businessman William Bingham, who was the region's largest landowner around the turn of the 19th century. Peters also had other business interests, operating a local gristmill and shipyard, and served as a founding trustee of Blue Hill Academy. Peters had this house built in 1815, when he was 80 years old. In the 20th century the property was adapted for use as an inn and resort. It is presently part of a estate that is operated as a retreat and function space, with the house and a cottage available for rent, along with a barn that provides meeting space and catering facilities.

The show worked with several blocks, where in each block a game is presented, counting on the participation of the Paquitas and the character Topo Gigio, a cartoon doll of a mouse that was very popular in the 1960s in Brazil and in the world.  Background  Xuxa became a household name throughout Latin America thanks to its children's television program El Show de Xuxa produced in Argentina during the years 1991 and 1993, and aired in 17 Latin American countries and United States by Univision, with an estimated audience of 25 million viewers.

Life Maria Magdalene washing the feet of Christ Jacob Andries Beschey was born in Antwerp as the son of Jacob Beschey and Maria-Theresia Huaert. He was baptized in the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp on 30 November 1710.Jacob Andries Beschey at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Jacob Andries had four brothers who all became painters. The best known were his elder brothers Carel who was a landscape painter and Balthasar who was a landscape, history and portrait painter. His younger brothers were Jan Frans, a sometime resident in London as a painter and art dealer, and Jozef Hendrik, a portrait painter active under the pseudonym Francis Lindo in England.Andries Jacob Andries Beschey, Saint Paul and Saint Anthony at Jean MoustCharlotte Gould, Sophie Mespl√®de, Marketing Art in the British Isles, 1700 to the Present: A Cultural History, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012, p. 106Tom van der Molen, De Amsterdamse Balthazar Bescheij (1738-1804), Een nieuwe toeschrijving bij een voluit gesigneerd portret at the Amsterdam Museum, 27 January 2015 Nothing is known about the training of Jacob Andries Beschey. He became a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1726‚Äì27 and was the dean of the Guild in 1766‚Äì67. Jacob Andries Beschey was also involved in art dealing for which he could rely on the connections with his brother in England.Beschey, Jacob-Andries at the Prado Museum He was the teacher of Philips Bonnecroy (III) (1732‚Äì33), Balthasar Beschey II and Antonie Verbruggen (1753) and Petrus Sneyders en Guiglielmus Claessens (1754). It is possible that his nephew, also called Balthasar, who was the son of his brother Joseph Hendrik active in England, was his pupil. Jacob Andries Beschey died in Antwerp on 28 February 1786. Work The flaggelation of Christ Jacob Andries Beschey painted mainly religious subjects and to a lesser extent landscapes. He possibly also painted still lifes. There is mention of a hunting piece in 1945 but it is not clear where this work is located and what was the basis for the attribution.Troph√©e de chasse, Jacob Andreas Beschey at Gallica Most of his work was inspired by the compositions of Rubens or followers of Rubens, which he may have known directly or from prints. An example is the Maria Magdalene washing the feet of Christ (Sold at Christie's 13 April 2010 in Amsterdam, lot 92) signed and dated 1735.Maria Magdalene washing the feet of Christ at Christie‚Äôs The picture is a mirror copy of a composition executed mainly by Anthony van Dyck together with Rubens that is in the Hermitage Museum and was based on a sketch by Rubens. The composition was known at the time through a print by the Flemish engraver Michel Natalis. It was popular with followers of Rubens and a very similar mirror version was made earlier by Victor Wolfvoet II.A woman washes Christ's feet with her tears, and wipes them with her hair at the Netherlands Institute for Art History The composition The Rest on the Flight into Egypt (sold at Bonhams 2 May 2012 in London, lot 60) goes back to an initial design by Giuseppe Bartolomeo Chiari, which was later reprised by Lorenzo Masucci for the Santa Maria dell'Orazione e Morte church in Rome.

The company was originally formed in 1791 under the name of Horrocks. Over the centuries, the name of the company changed with the involvement of various business partners and when the company merged with others.  Origin  Portrait of John Horrocks, textile pioneer The company was formed by John Horrocks in 1791. John Horrocks was the son of Mr John Horrocks, a quarry master and manufacturer of millstones at Edgworth near Bolton. At the time, the cotton business and the textile industry was expanding and John Horrocks was interested in the business possibilities. He originally bought two or three frames to spin cotton and started his business in his father‚Äôs factory. The yarn produced was sold to a Mr John Watson, who occupied the first cotton mill within Preston. After a disagreement with Watson and realising the potential of the textile industry, John Horrocks set up his own business in Preston.Lancashire Archives, Press cuttings and miscellaneous, DP/376/2p.50 Initially, the business started in a small building within Turk‚Äôs Head Court, Preston. With his business growing, John Horrocks realised that he needed more capital to develop and began to search for a business partner. One potential business partner, a Mr Bolton, was apparently scared away by Horrocks' enthusiasm, but a successful partnership with a Mr Richard Newsham allowed Horrocks to build his first mill in 1791 on Dale Street, Preston. After the first mill was built, the business continued to grow with a series of mills built over the course of ten years. As the business began to develop, John asked his brother Samuel to join him and made him a partner within the firm. John also invited his uncle, Issac Horrocks, to join the business and later gave him the Turks Head Court business.Preston Guardian ‚ÄòWithdrawal of Mr Hermon, M.P., from the firm of Messrs. Horrockses, Millers and Co.‚Äô (10 January 1880) As the business grew, John Horrocks' position in Preston also grew. Horrocks was a parliamentary candidate for the borough in 1796 but did not win a position until 1802. John Horrocks also built Penwortham Hall, which at the time was called Penwortham Lodge. John Horrocks built a very successful business and prospered within society. Known to be a kind and generous man, he died in London in 1804 at the age of 36. John Horrocks was succeeded both in his business and as the parliamentary representative for Preston by his brother Samuel. While John Horrocks did have children, none of them seem to take any role in the business. Archive sources reveal that John Horrocks left his partnership in the business to his son John Horrocks while leaving the bulk of his money to his son Peter Horrocks. Records reveal that John sold his shares in the firm to his uncle when he came of age in 1815.Lancashire Archives, Origin and Progress of Horrockses Crewdson & Co by Sir Charles Brown, DDHS/83 There are also records that Peter Horrocks sold Penwortham Lodge in 1829. All further references to Horrocks within the company refer to Samuel Horrocks.  Horrockses, Miller and Co. By 1815, the company was called Horrocks, Miller and Co. Thomas Miller began to work for the Horrocks brothers in 1802, specialising in clouding,Lancashire Archives, Press cuttings and miscellaneous, DP/376/2p.42 which was a different type of yarn developed by twist and colour, and was achieved by running two yarns of strongly contrasted colours through separate pairs of rollers.Eber Midgley, Technical terms in the Textile Trade (Manchester, Emmott & Co. 1932) p.80 Thomas Miller was originally from Bolton, but was recommended to John and Samuel Horrocks and they made him a partner of the firm. Miller was also influential within the borough of Preston becoming a council member like John and Samuel Horrocks. After his death in January 1840, he left a large interest and the principal management of Horrocks, Miller and Co. to his son Thomas Miller. By 1840, following the death of Samuel Horrocks and his son, there are no references or records of any involvement of the Horrocks family within the business. After the death and retirement of many members, Thomas Miller became the sole proprietor of Horrocks, Miller and Co. Miller was a popular figure within the community having purchased the estate and manor of Singleton in Fylde and became one of the largest landowners in Fylde. He was known to be a very generous man and donated to many causes including the rebuild of his local church. Similar to partners before him, he was also involved in the local councils. Thomas Miller married Henrietta Sarah, a daughter of Rev. Cornelius Pitt in 1841 who was also the niece of John and Samuel Horrocks. They had five children but like previous children of partners, none of them seem to have any involvement within the textile business and it was known that upon his death in 1865, his eldest son was preparing to enter the army. Once Thomas Miller took over the control of the firm in 1840, other people who were involved in the firm became partners within the business. In 1860, a Mr Edward Hermon, who previously had been a salesman, was admitted a partner and in 1866, a Mr Styles, who was the London salesman, was admitted. Thomas Miller died in 1865 and by 1887; Horrockses, Crewdson & Co was firmly established.Lancashire Archives, Provisional and preliminary contacts, DDVC/acc7340/box 19/6 Horrockses Yard Works, Preston, 1940s Talks between Horrocks, Miller and Co. and Crewdson, Crosses and Co. Ltd took place in 1885 but it wasn't until 1887 when the two companies merged to become Horrockses, Crewdson & Co. The company planned to remain 'businesses of cotton spinners, doublers and manufacturers of cloth and other goods manufactured from cotton'. By merging the companies, there were more partners involved and more business connections. The creation of Horrockses, Crewdson & Co. was the start of a new period for the company. Offices were based in Preston, Manchester and London and the company was expanding further with more possibilities overseas. The company grew and prospered with more subsidiary companies and an increase in the amount of cotton and products produced. Throughout this period, the board of directors changed frequently due to death and retirement. With the company expanding and documents often lacking in details, it is hard to keep a record of all the directors of the company. The lack of documents within the Horrockses, Crewdson & Co. collection at Lancashire Archives often produces gaps in the history of the company. Gaps in the history of the company continue, as very little is known about the company during the two world wars. While there is little information about the company during the first world war, information can be found in reference to the second. During the second world war, the business was involved in the Government's concentration scheme. The scheme was a voluntary merger of factories in order to free up space and production facilities for essential war work. Horrockses Fashions Following the war, the economy had changed and the way people bought clothes and fabrics had also changed. Ready-to-wear manufacture had been growing steadily during the period between the two world wars and Horrockses, Crewdson & Co. saw the opportunities for the business. In 1946, the first collection from Horrockses Fashions became available in retailers. Horrockses Fashions had the advantage of the Horrocks name, which had a strong reputation with the fabric industry, and Horrockses Fashion collections were predominantly made from cotton cloth which had been woven at the Preston factory, with fabrics designed exclusively for them. Horrockses Fashions was a huge success for the company. The popularity of the clothing expanded Horrockses Fashions line was soon producing items ranging from simple cotton shirtwaisters to glamorous evening gowns. Horrockses Fashions was soon so popular and well respected that the Queen packed cotton dresses from specialist wholesaler Horrockses for her six-month tour of the Commonwealth in 1953-4. Later history Records show Horrockses, Crewdson & Co. expanded overseas, with a foreign agency in Portugal in 1823 and another in India in 1830. The company continued to have mergers and relationships with other companies and countries throughout 19th and 20th century.Lancashire Archives, Register of applications for limits from overseas companies, DDHS/124 Branches were established overseas, such as Horrockses Fashions Canada. Horrockses, Crewdson & Co. retained a presence in Preston even when headquarters moved to London as the company grew. In the 20th century, the company received royal visits, including from foreign monarchy such as King Fuad of Egypt in 1927 and the Sultan of Zanzibar in 1929.Lancashire Archives, Miscellaneous Box, DDHS/83 While Horrockses Fashions survived as a brand until 1983, its peak success was between the years of 1946 to 1964. Horrockses went through a decline, starting in the 1960s, and despite attempts to revive it, with a new line of bed linen in the 1980s, the Horrockses name was eventually shelved. Horrockses Fashions has been revived twice in the past ten years; in 2011 for bed linens and later in 2016, this time focusing on fashion. The 2011 relaunch was initiated by Brookman Home, the firm which inherited the Horrockses brand, and consisted of a collection of bed linens, inspired by original dress designs. In 2013, the Horrockses name went up for sale, after Dawson International Holdings (which held the Horrockses brand) fell into administration in 2012. Bluewell Ventures acquired the name for a six-figure sum, and said it would relaunch Horrockses as a fashion label and target international markets. In spring 2016, the revived Horrockses released a line of clothing through the popular online clothing company, ASOS.com, with additional clothing pieces later in 2016 and 2017. The fashion line is made with cloth printed in the UK with dresses manufactured in London, and inspired by the original patterns from the brand's peak years.

Sociological development The commercialization of love is the ongoing process of infiltration of commercial and economical stimuli in the daily life of lovers and the association of monetary and non-monetary symbols and commodities in the love relationships. The application of Habermas‚Äô theory is helpful to fully understand the discussion of the relationship between the market and love. From the model of a two-tiered society postulated by Habermas (comprising the sphere of the systems and the life-world), Frankfurt School has affirmed that when romantic stimuli made with commercial proposes infiltrate the daily life of lovers it causes an undesired colonization of the life-world, thus reaffirming the irreducible contradiction between the economy and love. In contemporary societies, the economy is present in several spheres of love, offering cultural products that embody its ideals and feelings and providing the contexts in which to experience the romantic rituals (i.e. love manuals, sex therapists and marriage crisis counselors). Romantic love can be defined, according to S√©rgio Costa,Costa, S√©rgio (2005). \\"Easy Loving. Romanticism and Consumerism in Late Modernity\\".

Zur Codierung von Intimit√§t. Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1994 [1982] Two sociologists, in particular, have debated and analyzed in depth the theme of commercialization of love related to our society: Eva Illouz and Arlie R. Hochschild.  Eva Illouz Eva Illouz is a professor of sociology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Illouz's research has always focused on several different topics and themes such as the study of culture, communication and especially emotions. In particular, the theme of commercialization, or commodification, of love is well analyzed in her first book Consuming the Romantic Utopia, where indeed she describes how capitalism has transformed emotional patterns. At the beginning of the book, it is examined how romantic love has changed during time also due to the newly expanding mass markets of leisure. This change lead to the creation of a new process called romanticization of commodities, that is a process in which commodities played a crucial role in experiencing emotions such as love or romance. In the 1930s, commodities of any kind such as jewelry, household appliances and even basic generic products were advertised in newspapers, magazines and also in movies as essential indicators that will enable people to fully live and experience romance. Throughout the book, Illouz deals also with another process: the commodification of romance. She states that the practice of ‚Äúdating‚Äù replaced the practice of ‚Äúcalling on a woman‚Äù and going to her parents‚Äô house and it consequently moved romantic encounters from the home sphere to the sphere of consumption, that is going out on a date for example to the cinema or to have dinner in a fancy restaurant. The inscription of the romantic encounter into the leisure consumption‚Äôs sphere, due to the practice of dating, marked the entrance of romance in the market. All this was made possible, on one hand, by the availability of some goods and services such as cars or leisure travels that, until then, were reserved to the upper classes and, on the other, by the middle-classes‚Äô adoption of the working class‚Äô entertainments, such as going to the movie theatre.  A.R. Hochschild Arlie Russell Hochschild is a sociologist and a professor emerita at the Berkeley University of California. During her career, she studied and examined topics like market culture, family global patterns of care work, and the relationships between culture and emotion. She analyzed the linkage between love and market in several works, including The Outsourced Self: Intimate Life in Market Times (2012) Publishers Weekly. and The Commercialization of Intimate Life: Notes from Home and Work (2003). In her essay \\"The Commodity Frontier\\" (contained in The Commercialization of Intimate Life: Notes from Home and Work), she argued that the commodity frontier (the boundary between market commodities and emotions) has a double aspect: it is developed by both the market-place and the family. On the market side, this frontier represents for commercial companies an opportunity to develop new markets for products that in the past were associated with the familiar environment in the past (for example nannies, birthday party planners, personal chefs and so on). On the other hand, the supply of the products increases, with a growing number of families wants or desires to consume these services and goods. This particular market targets above all single men and women, or parents who spend most of their time working outside the house, without being able to devote their time to family or emotional relationships‚Äô care. These services have become affordable for rich people, while on the other side, lower or middle class members occupy these jobs positions. Besides, ‚Äúin their more recent incarnation, the commercial substitutes family activities often turn out to be better than the real thing‚Äù. Therefore, companies do not compete against each other, but with families. Commodification is moving into the domain of our private life and desires, creating an ambivalence; by purchasing goods and services that simulate family-like experience, we want, on one hand, to live some authentic experiences, like the one we experienced in the past with our family, but at the same time, we are enhancing the commodification of these practices by drawing upon these services.  Examples in modern society  Valentine‚Äôs day Valentine's Day, also known as Saint Valentine's Day,Chambers 21st Century Dictionary, Revised ed., Allied Publishers, 2005 is a religious celebration observed on 14 February each year, also if in some countries it is celebrated in different occasions. In Russia and in the Eastern Orthodox Church in general Valentines‚Äô day is celebrated on 6 and 30 July, while in Brazil the Dia de S√£o Valentim is recognized on 12 June. During this day, traditionally, lovers exchange symbols and commodities to show their sentiments to each other. This tradition developed during the 19th century in England, where people started to express their love for each other by donating flowers, offering sweets and exchanging handwritten greeting cards (known as \\"valentines\\"), that rapidly were replaced with mass-produced ones. In the later 20th and early 21st centuries, this Valentine's Day tradition spread to other countries, arriving in some East Asian countries with globalization and concentrated marketing strategies, becoming a worldwide celebration differentiated in each country with several peculiarities and behaviors.  Online dating Internet has revolutionized courtship by becoming the biggest love mall around here. Nowadays finding love is considered a work and a lot of people do not think they are able to do it on their own. For this reason single people see dating websites as a support that will help them to find the perfect partner. Finding your soulmates and sexual chemistry are exactly the core ideas, the pillars at the bottom of love seekers‚Äô industry. In fact, dating websites‚Äô users behave like shoppers: they have a list of desired qualities and or physical characteristics they look for in a partner; you have only few seconds to brand yourself, make a good impression and be chosen among thousands of other people before being rejected with a click. Internet dating isn‚Äôt always as rewarding as it may appear: sometimes people remain hurt because they invest money, time and feelings in it but they still can‚Äôt find the ‚Äúright‚Äù person or face problems with users who lie about their age, drug habits or marital status. Some websites, by embracing the spirit of capitalism and applying statistics to love, even provide their ‚Äúclients‚Äù with surveys using pie charts, graph or rating systems such as ROI and CSI (Couple Satisfaction Index). The industry of love has also devoted some websites to matching daters by religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disabilities and even level of intelligence.  Outsourcing of care and love In her essay ‚ÄúLove and Gold‚Äù, Hochschild explains that nowadays the world is facing a particular global trend: care and love importation from poor countries to rich nations is increasing sharply. Professionals from the developing countries leave their workplaces for better job opportunities and higher salaries in richer countries, usually in Europe or in the United States. However, this trend widens the gap between poor and rich countries. Today, there is a parallel trend, in which care workers started to leave developing countries to care for children, elders, and sick people in richer nations. Therefore, due to the growing demand for care workers, a large number of women is migrating in order to find jobs as nurses, nannies, and so on. These jobs allow women to send home enough money to sustain their families; in the words of Hochschild: ‚Äúmigration has become a private solution to a public problem‚Äù. Half of the world's migrants are now constituted by women, who emigrate to find mostly domestic jobs. In this process, not only time and energy are involved, but also love; in this situation, we can consider love as a resource that is extracted from one place and \\"consumed\\" somewhere else. As reported by Hochschild : \\"If love is a resource, it's a renewable resource; it creates more of itself\\".supra note 1 p. 191 Love and feelings are profitable resources, but we do not invest feelings, we find a new object towards to redirect it. The richest/upper-class families invite nannies to displace their love towards their own children; many families welcome the fact that the nanny would import her native culture values. They identify their care practices as more relaxed, patient and joyful. Love as a resource is not just extracted from poor countries and then imported in the richest ones. It is created, or rather assembled, with elements that come from both cultural environments. The love that nannies express, once migrated, towards children i is partially produced in the richer countries, and it is also the outcome of money, ideology, loneliness and yearning for their sons and daughters. The suffering of these women is not visible to the nannies‚Äô employers; they just focus on the love that nannies show towards their children. Therefore, nanny‚Äôs love becomes a \\"thing itself. It is unique, private ‚Äì fetishized\\".supra note 1 p.193 While objectifying a concept, we start to consider it outside its natural context. By isolating the concept of care from the context in which is produced, we unconsciously separate the logic of nanny love from the economic and capitalist context in which is created.

Rice Silk Mill is a historic textile mill at 55 Spring Street in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Built in 1876 to house a woolen mill, this multi- section brick building was purchased in 1887 by William Bainbridge Rice, who established his silk-processing operation here. The premises were expanded in 1895 after Rice acquired a New Jersey silkworks and moved its equipment here. The Rice Company was one of Pittsfield's largest business at the turn of the 20th century. It produced a number of highly specialized materials, including silk cords for parachutes, which they later also made out of nylon. The company was particularly known for its braided silk cord. The facilities were used in the production of silk cording until 2006. The property has since been converted residential use. The mill complex is located northeast of downtown Pittsfield, in the city's Morningside residential neighborhood. It is on , bounded on the north by Burbank Street, the east by Spring Street, and the west by Cherry Street. It consists of five interconnected brick mill buildings, erected between 1876 and 1947, all of which are between two and three stories in height. All exemplify the use of an insurance standard fireproof design, with brick exterior walls, and heavy timber frames inside. Windows are typically set in segmented-arch openings with quarry-faced granite sills. As part of the residential conversion, some ground-floor window bays have been converted into entrances.

Early life He was born in Strasbourg, the principal city and capital of the Alsace region of eastern France. He went to the √âcole Polytechnique et de T√©l√©com in Paris, and the Centre National d'√âtudes des T√©l√©communications. Career He joined France T√©l√©com in 1976. From 1982 he directed the GSM development and standardisation project for France T√©l√©com. From 1988 he was GSM programme director for France T√©l√©com Mobile. Text messaging With the German engineer Friedhelm Hillebrand, he created the standards for text messaging in 1984, resulting in February 1985 with the GSM (Groupe Sp√©cial Mobile) standard, also known as Global System for Mobile Communications for the Short Message Service (SMS), now known as text messaging. After the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) standards had been fixed in the late 1970s, Short Message Service (SMS): The Creation of Personal Global Text Messaging there were thoughts about making a public digital mobile communication network. Mobitex, a Public Access Mobile Radio network standard had been conceived in 1981, and put into operation in the mid-1980s. The cooperation programme between France and Germany was known as S900 (from the 900Mhz waveband, and was analogue) and was expected to be in operation by 1986. It was decided to create a digital mobile network, GSM, in 1984, and for this to be in operation by the end of the decade. A prototype digital system, DF900, would be in place before GSM was ready. The new GSM system would have a radio paging service. The Europe-wide Eurosignal paging service had been in operation since 1974. Germany introduced its C-Netz analogue mobile phone network in 1985, based on the C450 standard; it had a digital switching system and digital control channels, and could have implemented a short data message system. In a meeting in late October 1984, the French part of the DF900 project submitted a proposal for the provision of an enhanced paging service, with diffusion of alphanumeric messages to mobile users with acknowledgment capabilities. The messaging system would be two-way, unlike paging systems. On 12 November 1984 at a meeting in London, this proposal became simply the transmission of short alphanumeric messages with acknowledgement capabilities.

As well as depicting roses and/or castles, the designs often include other flowers and landscapes.  History  Floral designs may predate those incorporating castles by almost 30 years  Origins  The style of Roses and Castles likely developed in the 1850s, approaching the decline of the British canal system and at a time when rail was proving a more popular method of transporting goods. A false origin of the style suggests that it originates from the Llangollen Canal in the early 20th century, where a lengthsman grew an abundance of roses and had a picturesque view of Chirk Castle from his garden. In reality, the movement had been well established since 1858. A number of theories to the origin of the design exist. Similarities have been drawn between the style and that used on vardos by Romani people; it is possible that some Romanis took up employment as boatmen and brought their designs with them onto the waterways.Lewery (1974), p. 26. In this instance, the suggested influence of castles on the artwork comes from castles in the Carpathian Mountains.Lewery (1974), p. 27. Another explanation is that the style originated with a dog-rose design painted by one boatman (or his family) and grew from there; alternatively, it has been noted that the garland of roses design bears resemblance to decorations applied to Sheraton furniture at the turn of the 19th century.Lewery (1974), p. 30. It is probable that the design originated from the Birmingham and Black Country area.Lewery (1974), p. 37. The use of roses predated the addition of castles; the earliest recorded use of castles in narrowboat decoration is from 1873.  Application  Many boatmen (and their families) spent significant time on narrowboats and barges, and the artwork became a source of pride as well as individuality. One theory suggests that the amount of time families spent on the canals meant they were undereducated and became ostracised from society, and so the artwork became their \\"proud statement of separateness, self esteem, and a traditional way of doing things\\". The art would be applied at the expense of the boatman rather than the boatowning company, who would have ensured the boat was dressed in company livery. Items typically painted in the roses and castles style include internal furniture and fittings, as well as the boat's headlamp and water cans. In The Inland Waterways of England, L. T. C. Rolt described how boatmen would gladly decorate any part of their vessel in \\"fabulous castle scenes with garlands of roses\\", and compared the painted boats to \\"the decorated poop of an Elizabethan galleon\\". An early description of the style referred to it as \\"the great teaboard school of art\\", a pejorative comparison to cheap tin trays popular at that time. John Hollingshead described the style in Household Words as \\"fanciful composition landscapes [and] several gaudy wreaths of flowers\\".  Design  The insides of the stern doors are adorned with castles, and the Buckby Can on the roof is decorated with roses Links have been drawn between roses and castles and German, Dutch and Asian folk art, as well as a striking resemblance of Romani Gypsy caravans. Robert Aickman described the design as being \\"brighter and gayer of anything else of the kind now to be found in England\\", and recognised that it served to advertise waterways. Boat painting was often undertaken by dock and wharf workers, and the styles of particular dockyards‚Äîsuch as those at Polesworth and Braunston‚Äîwere uniquely identifiable.Lewery (1974), p. 110.

Early electric motors were sometimes of the reciprocating type, such as those made by Daniel Davis in the 1840s. Today, reciprocating electric motors are rare but they do have some niche applications, e.g. in linear compressors for cryogenics and as educational toys.\\"WONDERMAGNET.COM NdFeB Magnets, Magnet Wire, Books, Weird Science, Needful Things\\". wondermagnet.com. Retrieved on 31 March 2015. History Daniel Davis was an early maker of reciprocating electric motors. As can be seen in these examples, early motors of this type often followed the general layout of the steam engines of the day, simply replacing the piston-and-cylinder with an electromagnetic solenoid.

The coil is used here to repulse and attract the armature. reciprocating electric motor with an ferromagnetic armature. The coil is used here to attract the armature. A reciprocating electric motor uses an alternating magnetic field to move its armature back and forth, rather than circularly as in a conventional electric motor. A single field coil may be placed at one end of the armature's possible movement, or a field coil may be used at each end. The armature may be a permanent magnet, in which case the coil or coils can exert both repulsive and attractive force on the armature. If there are two coils, they will be wound and connected so that their like poles face each other, so that when (for example) the poles facing the armature are both negative, one pole will attract the armature's south pole while the other will repel its north pole. When the armature reaches the extreme of its movement, polarity to the coils is reversed. The armature may instead be made of ferromagnetic material, as in an electromagnetic solenoid. In this case the current in the coils will alternate between on and off, rather than between polarities. A single-coil motor with a non-magnetic armature would require a spring or some other \\"return\\" mechanism to move the armature away from the coil upon completion of the \\"attract\\" cycle. An \\"interrupter\\"-style electromechanical buzzer operates on this same principle. A dual-coil motor would alternately energize the two coils. Where the motor is adapted to produce rotary motion, the return mechanism consists of a crankshaft and flywheel. This is an extremely simple motor, such that demonstration models may be easily constructed for teaching purposes. As a practical motor it has several disadvantages. Magnetic field strength drops off rapidly with increasing distance. In the reciprocating electric motor the distance between armature and field coil must necessarily increase considerably over its minimum value; this reduces the motor's output power and starting force. Vibration is also an issue. Applications Linear compressors A design for a linear compressor of this type has been produced by the Cryogenic Engineering Group at the University of Oxford. Pumps See Plunger pump Electric shavers Some electric shavers use reciprocating motors. Toys Educational toys can be built as DIY projects.

It is a Hong Kong internet slang that originated from the discussion on Instagram and The Golden Forum () news report on beauty beggars Definition Involved cybercitizens claim that beauty beggars have these following characteristics: some of the introductions are self-contradictory or of poor quality; the declaration of interest is lacking in the presentations; they overcharge sponsorship either from public relations agencies or cosmetics companies; etc. Tsui Yuen (), a Hong Kong columnist who specialises in marketing, pointed out that the nature of a beauty beggar is the abuse of the \\"Word of Mouth\\" marketing model. Also, Janice Wong, a Hong Kong fashion critic, holds the opinion that the prototype of beauty beggar is the advertorial on \\"personal media\\"() platform. In 2014, after some cybercitizens reported beauty beggars to the Customs and Excise Department in Hong Kong, the spokesman of Hong Kong Customs announced that they would follow up the case, for the beauty beggars might have violated section 13E of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, which covers \\"misleading omissions\\". The official indicated that different cases vary so more investigation and evidence is required to make fair judgements. Origin Beauty beggars originated from some local beauty bloggers in Hong Kong, who are keen on sharing their experiences of using some beauty products with other cybercitizens. With their followers accumulating, some beauty bloggers that are more popular may be invited by some public relations agencies or cosmetics companies to promote beauty products. Thus, even if the product is not effective, these beauty bloggers may still give positive reviews on it. Some beauty bloggers were found to disguise the products that they get from public relations agencies as self-purchased products so as to raise the credibility of the promoting products. Moreover, some famous bloggers might sell the samples that they obtained from public relations agencies to viewers so as to earn extra profits. Customers who bought those products then discovered that they did not work or might cause allergic problems. Also, some beauty bloggers price their blog, Facebook page, or YouTube video to ask for extra sponsorship from involved companies. Therefore, some cybercitizens criticize them as ‚Äúbeauty beggars‚Äù.[2] Development Due to the increasing trend of using social networking sites like YouTube and web blogs, people love to share their experience of using various products or collect useful information for daily life uses. In addition to the increasing popularity of social network, the continuous inflow of cosmetics and skin care products, especially from Korea and Taiwan, has raise the needs of beauty information for potential customers. Customers believe that they can rely on beauty bloggers' experience to choose the beauty products that suit them most. This in turn created a need for beauty bloggers. Beauty bloggers use either videos or texts to comment on different brands of beauty products after use. Thus, their audience can use their reviews or self-used reports as references before purchasing those beauty products. Some public relation agencies invited them to recommend some products by giving them some testers, but the article they wrote are similar to advertisements, since they simply give positive comments on those products.[2] As YouTube becomes more popular, the sharing form transfers from writing articles to making videos, so many beauty bloggers became beauty YouTubers, who are likely to be paid according to the number of likes for their YouTube clips. It was reported that some of the popular beauty YouTubers even ask for 40,000 to 50,000 Hong Kong Dollar for each YouTube clip.[6] Objections Some cybercitizens created Facebook pages and BBS website to show their objections to beauty beggars. In order to gather related information and propaganda, cybercitizens also established their fan club on YouTube platform and set up their database in Google Document and Instagram. In 2014, after some cybercitizens posted on the Golden Forum claiming that they obtained evidences of beauty beggars' behind-the-scenes deals, some beauty bloggers were caught up in some human flesh search () cases. Criticisms Many Hong Kong cybercitizens showed their opposition to the beauty beggars, and some of them listed several reasons for opposing them. A famous blogger summarized these reasons why people are against beauty beggars according to their voices: * Misusing the YouTube platform. * Posting advertisements instead of useful information. * Poor quality of posts. * Concealing drawbacks of their products and exaggerating the effects of products.

There are many depressions, solution valleys, small karst poljes, and the remains of former river valleys. During the Pliocene the rivers leveled the tectonic upwelling and filled the valleys. Traces were also left by Pliocene glaciation because glaciers created small cirques on what had been a relatively level surface, as well as ground moraines and terminal moraines. The rivers transported gravel and deposited it in lower areas, filling the depressions.  Rock  The north side of the plateau shows tectonic formation along the Idrija Fault oriented in the Dinaric direction,Zupan Hajna, Nadja. 2014.

Ljubljana: ZRC, p. 165. and the south side shows the results of tectonic thrusting of Mesozoic limestone and dolomite over younger Eocene flysch. Two-thirds of the surface is covered by limestone, one-fourth by dolomite, and the remainder is flysch and loose material.  Mountains  The highest summit is Big Mount Golak (Veliki Golak, ). On the northern side, some other panoramic and frequently visited summits are Little Mount Golak (Mali Golak, ), Mount Poldanovec (), and Pointed Peak (≈†piƒçasti vrh ), and on the southern side Big Mount Modrasovec (Veliki Modrasovec, ), Mount Kucelj (), Blue Peak (Sinji vrh, ), and Kovk Hill ().

The Trnovo Forest Plateau lies in a continental temperature zone. It receives an average of of precipitation per year. Differences in the quantity of precipitation differ little on a monthly basis. The greatest precipitation is in November () and the least in February (). The majority of winter precipitation is in the form of snow, especially at higher elevations. The bora wind is a typical weather phenomenon, blowing down from the plateau towards the sea with gusts often exceeding . The bora can cause considerable damage in the area, uprooting trees and tearing the roofs off of houses.  Water  Despite the abundant precipitation, karst plateaus have almost no water. The drainage divide is unclear because of the karst surface. The largest spring is that of the Hubelj River near Ajdov≈°ƒçina.  Vegetation  The Trnovo Forest Plateau is covered by mixed beech and fir forest (Abieti- fagetum dinaricum). The highest vegetation is on Little Mount Golak (), which is bare at the summit, below which grow dwarf willow (Salix sp.) and mountain pine (Pinus mugo). Protected flora grows in the rocky crevices, including the Carniolan primrose (Primula carniolica). The share of forest is 75.5%, but this is increasing because of the afforestation of abandoned farmland. Poor accessibility has resulted in relatively good preservation of the landscape features. The highest peaks are overgrown with mountain pine or grass. Dinaric beech and fir forest grow at elevations between and . At lower elevations this transitions into Dinaric submontane beech forest. There is relatively little shrubland.  Soil  Chromic cambisol and rendzina have developed on Cretaceous and Jurassic limestone and on Triassic dolomite. More acidic soils are found only on limestone with chert. Due to karstification, the depth of regolith is very uneven. The substantial precipitation quickly erodes the soil, and it is also carried away by the bora wind in exposed locations.  Population  The plateau had a population of 4,534 in the 1991 census, and the population density was only , making the area one of the most sparsely populated in Slovenia. Only the western part is inhabited. The settlements were formed through more recent high-elevation colonization, and the dominant patterns are clustered villages and isolated farms. The age profile of the population is unfavorable.  Economy  In addition to forestry, farming is also an important economic activity. The basic farming activity is animal husbandry, especially raising cattle. The share of the farming population is 14.4%. Tourism is becoming increasingly important: the steep slopes of the plateau attract hikers, and some karst features also attract visitors, especially ice caves and sinkholes because of the vegetation associated with them.

His achievements include turning a $2m investment in Skype into $200m and a $8m investment in Wix.com into $700m. Career Tluszcz spent the first 10 years of his professional career at Arthur Andersen, ultimately becoming a partner in its business consulting practice before running its European venture capital fund. During this time he personally invested in a number of businesses including the Frederick Brewing Company which listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. In 2000 he founded Mangrove Capital Partners with Gerard Lopez and Hans-J√ºrgen Schmitz. He was the first investor in Skype, a telecoms business founded by Janus Friis and Niklas Zennstr√∂m - who were at the time known for founding Kazaa, the peer-to-peer file sharing application. On 14 October 2005 Skype was acquired by eBay and Tluszcz was named as one of the most respected technology dealmakers globally by Forbes magazine. In 2006, Tluszcz backed cloud-based web development platform Wix.com. He persuaded Wix.com not to sell when it was offered $400m and the company went on to float on NASDAQ in 2013. Its market capitalisation reached $5bn in 2018. It remains the largest tech IPO to come out of Israel. Tluszcz's firm looks at 2,000 startup deals a year but invests in just six. It has made approximately 100 investments into early-stage technology companies predominantly in Europe and Israel since it was founded in 2000. The company has raised four funds and has $750 million in \\"assets under management\\". In 2016 it had seven or eight startups in its portfolio enjoying rapid growth and worth over ¬£100 million. Controversy Tluszcz drew controversy in April 2015 when he stated that the majority of 'unicorn' companies (those claiming to be worth over $1bn) were in fact 'fakies'. Later in the year the technology industry experienced a significant correction with many highly prized companies seeing their values slashed. Having been valued at over $1bn in 2015, Shazam was acquired by Apple in 2017 in a deal thought to be worth $400m. In April 2016 and amid growing excitement in the fintech sector, Tluszcz attracted controversy again by writing about a 'fintech mirage' in an article published by the Financial Times which advised investors to ignore the hype about fintech, called for greater regulation and raised concerns about the peer-to-peer lending sector. Weeks later peer-to-peer lending platform Lending Club revealed on its earnings call that the CEO had been removed for unethical behaviour. The company's stock crashed 50%, seeing its market capitalization fall by $1.5bn over the following two weeks. He also predicted that app-only banks may struggle to gain the trust of consumers and grow their customer base. Tluszcz has also expressed doubts over the business models of Gig economy companies such as Uber and Deliveroo which have been accused of not paying adequate wages and taxes. He predicted these businesses will have to go through massive structural changes driven by individual countries‚Äô laws.

While studying at UAEU she worked with engineering consultants in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, including Musanada, a buildings construction management and design in facilities management firm. For hands-on engineering, she won second place in Emirates Skills national carpentry competition and she was the only and first female participating. Reem received the granted U.S. patent for her original invention, a \\"Lower Extremity Vehicle Navigation Control System\\"., and it has since been granted in Japan. The system uses a steering lever, an acceleration lever and a brake lever which are entirely foot-controlled, allowing people to drive a car without the use of their upper body. The system is the first of its kind, and the UAEU also has patents pending in China and the European Union. It has become one of the remarkable success of the Takamul program. The idea of Reem's invention crossed her mind when she watched a TV interview on Inside Edition with Jessica Cox, the world's first licensed armless pilot as she mentioned in her interview difficulties of driving cars for long distances using only her feet.

It is the biggest public aquarium in Israel, and it hosts over 800 species. It was founded in 1974 and was the first of its kind. The park and aquarium is located to the south of Eilat's Coral Beach nature reserve.  History  The park was founded in 1974 by the zoologist and marine biologist David Friedman. The idea of the observatory was planned in 1972, it took careful planning to create the observatory without harming the natural environment. The observatory was built completely on land, which was then flooded with water from the Red Sea using armory parts and other metals. The base of the observatory was connected to large iron chains, and after the observatory was placed many corals were planted on and around the observatory in order to repair the damage that was done during the making of the observatory. The coral reef around the observatory flourished and became a major feeding spot for many fish and other marine wildlife, both carnivorous and herbivore.  Exhibits   Entrance aquarium  The entrance aquarium is a medium cubic aquarium in the entrance square of the park. It features several species such as corals, butterflyfishes, crabs, and more. The aquarium (as well as in all the other exhibits at the park) is connected directly to Red Sea, and so the water is pumped and replaced constantly with Red Sea water, and so fully natural conditions are kept within the aquarium. File:PikiWiki Israel 18170 Geography of Israel.jpgThe entrance aquarium  Red Sea circular exhibit  The Red Sea Circular Exhibit is a 360 degrees exhibit in which the visitors stand in the middle and are surrounded by 360,000 litres of water featuring a complete natural ecosystem. The exhibit features corals, herbivorous fish, carnivorous fish, parasites, crabs, shrimp and more, all living in one functioning ecosystem. All the animals are fed daily thus ensuring they don't harm each other. The Circular exhibit is used for research about the unique ecosystem of coral reefs. The water in the circular exhibit are pumped from 42 meters deep in the Red Sea and are circulated 24/7. File:Eilat Underwater Observatory.JPGParrotfish at the Circular exhibit  Turtle and stingray pools  The Turtle and Stingray pools are three shallow (3.5 meter deep) pools, which exhibit hawksbill sea turtle, green sea turtles, and spotted eagle rays. In the middle of one of the pools there's a small sand island for female turtles to lay their eggs on. When the eggs hatch, the baby sea turtles are taken into a small aquarium, where they are safe from predators and where they get food and vaccinations. When they grow they are transferred to bigger aquarium, and finally when they are two year old with very high chance to survive in the wild they are released into the ocean. The Underwater Observatory's turtle conservation program is one of the leading programs in the field and so far has released hundreds of turtles back to nature. File:PikiWiki Israel 8788 Geography of Israel.jpgFemale Green sea turtle in the turtle pool  Rare fish exhibit  The Rare Fish Exhibit is a large exhibit separated into three rooms which exhibits rare fauna and flora of the red sea in medium-sized aquariums. The first two rooms feature animals such as lionfishes, Red Sea clownfish, star fish, rare corals, moray eels, lobsters, sea horses and more. In the exhibit there is a total of 250 species, featured in 35 medium aquariums. Some of the animals in the exhibit are endemic to the Red Sea, and are in the observatory park for means of breeding and conservation. The sea horse conservation program is a success, and since 2002 thousands sea horses has been released into the Red Sea. Despite the animals the aquariums are designed to mimic the animals' natural habitat and thus educate visitors about different marine biomes and habitats. The third room of the exhibit is the nocturnal room. The nocturnal room features various nocturnal animals such as flashlight fish, squids, jellyfishes, crabs and more. The exhibit also features active and awake corals - as corals are nocturnal animals. Most of the animals in the exhibit are capable of bioluminescence.

The seat of the municipality is the town Ersek√´.Law nr. 115/2014 The total population is 11,070 (2011 census), in a total area of 864.74 km2. It is coterminous with the former Kolonj√´ District, and an Albanian ethnographic region with mostly the same borders and also the same name (which may or may not include the area around Leskovik due to competing definitions). Location Kolonj√´ is located in south-east Albania and its capital is Ersek√´. Other towns in this district include Leskovik to the south. It is bounded by Kor√ß√´ to the north and Greece to the east, including the regional units of Kastoria and Ioannina. The town of Ersek√´ is located at the foot of mount Gramos, Albania's fourth-highest mountain with a peak at 2,525 m above sea level. History During the Middle Ages a region under the name Koloneia is located in the mountain region south of Kor√ß√´ (southeast Albania) and north of Konitsa and Kastoria (northwestern Greece) at the west slopes of Grammos mountain range. A Byzantine military garrison under the same name was built west of Grammos. According to the account of John Skylitzes, in , after the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria, emperor Basil II created new themes at Koloneia (ŒöŒøŒªœéŒΩŒµŒπŒ±), Dryinopolis, and Dyrrhachium, and settled former Byzantine prisoners of war to secure the Byzantine positions in Epirus against future enemy attacks from central and western Macedonia. At 1040s the theme of Koloneia was incorporated to the Duchy of Dyrrachion. After the Sack of Constantinople at 1204 and the following partition of the Byzantine Empire Koloneia was granted to the Republic of Venice. However, Koloneia came under the control of the Despotate of Epirus and formed one of the themes of the Despotate. Following the Battle of Pelagonia in 1259 Koloneia was ceded to the Empire of Nicaea. Prior to the 14th century Albanian migrations the area was inhabited by Aromanians. One of the two main waves of Albanian movements coming from the north entered Kolonj√´ in the 14th century, with the wave also affecting the neighboring Dang√´llia region. The name Kolonja refers to the former Vlach presence and is related to the Roman period of the area.

Instead, she believes that the questions of focus are whether discrimination is legal and whether equal opportunity for employment and protection under the law should exist for all people. In June 2014, Piggott joined with other LGBT support groups throughout the Caribbean in a project called Generation Change. Activists from the region called on heads of state to embrace all members of society and eliminate discriminatory laws and customs. In response to B-GLAD's appeal, Prime Minister Freundel Stuart said he was committed to eliminating discrimination for all Bajans, including the LGBT community. A study completed by B-Glad in 2014, The State of LGBT Barbados: A Brief Overview, found that stigma and discrimination, unequal and homophobic legislation, and lack of acceptance produce \\"covert oppression\\" for LGBT Bajans. Piggott stressed that the harshness of Barbadian law, which calls for life imprisonment for consensual sexual acts, leads to feelings of non-acceptance, depression, substance abuse, absence from school due to fear of discrimination. In January 2015, Piggott was named as one of the recipients of the Queen's Young Leader Award. The award provides recognition to young leaders across the Commonwealth in the name of HM Queen Elizabeth II, the Head of the Commonwealth and the Head of State of Barbados. Queen Elizabeth presented the award in June 2015. Piggott is the CEO and Founder of Pink Coconuts, a platform that connects LGBTQ travellers with LGBTQ friendly accommodation, tours and activities across the world while empowering LGBTQ local LGBTQ lives. She is TEDx Bridgetown speakerhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5Ac8gzu8Ds&t;=14s and in 2017 she became a Watson University Scholar https://watson.is/scholar/donnya- piggott/ where she studied Social Entrepreneurship in Boulder, Colorado.

Serlo may have hoped to ingratiate himself with the king by warning him. The fact that any correspondence does not survive is not conclusive, as correspondence of this sort was routinely destroyed after receipt.

The wood of the tropical species M. laurentii has similar qualities and uses, but is slightly darker, and lacks the copious yellowish white resin of the heartwood vessels. Its foliage is similar to that of Pterocarpus rotundifolius, and it may be confused with the latter when observed from a distance. Panga Panga is often mistakenly called Partridge Wood, this is incorrect and an entirely different Genus. Range and status It is found in southern Tanzania, eastern Zimbabwe, Mozambique and very locally in the Venda region of South Africa.At Ha-Makhuvha (22¬∞46'S 30¬∞23'E) where 159 specimens were left in 2007. See: T. Mutshinyalo, 2011. Though locally common or even dominant, over-utilization may deplete many populations. Besides harvesting for timber, their numbers are also depleted by unsustainable harvesting of bark and roots, which are employed for medicinal and magical purposes. Description The large compound leaves are greenish above and bluish green below, with one terminal and 7 to 9 pairs of opposite leaflets. It is deciduous, with the foliage emerging before flowering time. The large, lilac flowers appear from November to January as seasonal rains commence, and are produced on long, pendulous racemes. The woody seed pods are flat and velvety, and release their seeds when they split open due to increasing torsion. The root nodules have a symbiotic relationship with rhizobial bacteria. Isolated chemicals The flavonoid robinetin has been isolated in the heartwood and the Œ±-amino acid (S)-canavanine has been isolated from the seeds. Timber value and trade The highly priced and valued wood has a range of applications, including flooring, furniture, musical instruments and boat building. The heartwood is very durable, as it is not affected by fungi, dry-wood borers or termites, but the sapwood is vulnerable to powderpost beetles. It is locally sawn, and exported legally from Tanzania and Mozambique, especially Zambezia Province. It accounts for some 45% of timber legally exported from Tanzania, and much of it is bought by Chinese buyers, who in turn re-export a portion to the West.

They include adjacent cities and counties in the New York metropolitan area as well as in other states, U.S. territories, and foreign countries. * * Within New York metro area Historical proposals The Westchester County cities of Yonkers and Mount Vernon directly border the northern part of the Bronx and share much of that borough's heavily urbanized character. In 1894, the voters of Yonkers and Mount Vernon, along with voters in other parts of southern Westchester, took part in a referendum to determine if they wanted to become part of New York City, along with the voters in Kings, Queens and Richmond Counties (today's Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island, respectively). At that time, the city consisted only of Manhattan and a portion of the present-day Bronx, which had been part of Westchester until it became part of New York City in 1874. While the results of the 1894 vote were positive elsewhere, including in several other adjacent sections of Westchester, which were then annexed to the city and which thus became part of the new borough of the Bronx, the returns were so negative in Yonkers and Mount Vernon that those two areas were not included in the consolidated city and remained independent municipalities., pp. 177‚Äì78 A subway connection was planned between Getty Square in downtown Yonkers and the New York City Subway, but the project was abandoned after the failed merger vote. Local residents frequently refer to the area as \\"the sixth borough\\", referring to the two cities' location bordering the Bronx, the high number of local residents employed in Manhattan, and the area's similarly urban character. In 1934, a bill, submitted by a New York City alderman Elias H. Jacobs, proposed merging Yonkers into New York City as a sixth borough.\\"ADDING OF YONKERS TO CITY IS SOUGHT; Alderman Jacobs Says He Will Present Bill Seeking Merger as a Sixth Borough.\\", The New York Times, November 3, 1934. Retrieved August 26, 2007. \\"Merging the city of Yonkers with New York City as a sixth borough was proposed last night by Alderman Elias H. Jacobs, Washington Heights Democrat, who said he would introduce a local bill in the Board of Aldermen branch of the Municipal Assembly at its next meeting on Nov. 13.\\" Joseph F. Loehr, then Mayor of Yonkers, was opposed to the merger, despite Jacobs' argument that such a maneuver would cause a rise in real estate prices and increase quality of transit. Hudson Waterfront The Hudson Waterfront is often referred to as a \\"sixth borough.\\". New Jersey's Hudson Waterfront lies opposite Manhattan on the Hudson River, and during the Dutch colonial era, was under the jurisdiction of New Amsterdam and known as Bergen. Jersey City and Hoboken in Hudson County are sometimes referred to as the sixth borough, given their proximity and connections by PATH trains.Holusha, John. \\"Commercial Property / The Jersey Riverfront; On the Hudson's West Bank, Optimistic Developers\\", The New York Times, October 11, 1998. Accessed May 25, 2007. \\"'That simply is out of the question in midtown,' he said, adding that some formerly fringe areas in Midtown South that had previously been available were filled up as well. Given that the buildings on the New Jersey waterfront are new and equipped with the latest technology and just a few stops on the PATH trains from Manhattan, they become an attractive alternative. 'It's the sixth borough', he said.\\" Fort Lee, in Bergen County, opposite Upper Manhattan and connected by the George Washington Bridge, has also been called the sixth borough.Lefkowitz, Melanie. \\"Bergen County's Fort Lee: Town With a View\\". The Wall Street Journal. April 30, 2011. Accessed September 16, 2012. In the 1920s, soon after the creation of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey there were calls to integrate the rail and subway system in New York and Northern New Jersey by expanding the New York City Subway. After Mayor Bloomberg called for the 7 Subway Extension to continue to Secaucus Junction, a feasibility study was conducted and released in April 2013. Waterways and islands Governors Island is one example of a place that has been referred to as a \\"sixth borough.\\" In 2011, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg referred to the city's waterfront and waterways as a composite sixth borough during presentations of planned rehabilitation projects along the city's shoreline, including Governor's Island in the Upper New York Bay. Other individuals have also referred to the city's waterways as a sixth borough. Rikers Island has been called the 6th borough. A 2011 proposal by Vishaan Chakrabarti, a professor at Columbia University's Center for Urban Real Estate, suggested using land fill to connect lower Manhattan and Governors Island, so creating a new neighborhood referred to as \\"LoLo\\". Land fill has been used to expand Manhattan before, most notably in the creation of Battery Park City, which utilized material from the construction of the original World Trade Center. Chakrabarti and others have pointed out challenges to the proposal, which include cost, the strict regulations surrounding building with land fill, and the potential environmental effects of the project. The proposal was revisited in 2015 by author Jon Methven of The Awl, in which he referred to the proposed borough as \\"Frankenborough\\". Outside New York metro area Places outside of the New York metropolitan area that are home to large populations of former New Yorkers have also been referred to as the \\"sixth borough\\", including Philadelphia; Miami, and South Florida in general; Los Angeles; and, outside the continental U.S., Puerto Rico and Israel. Among those places referred to as a sixth borough are locations as diverse as Beverly Hills, California, and Nashville, Tennessee. Philadelphia Philadelphia has frequently been cited as a \\"sixth borough\\" due to its proximity to New York and the movement of New York residents to Philadelphia for various reasons, including lower rent prices and generally lower cost of living. The nickname has been met with apprehension by both Philadelphia and New York publications. Some have even disputed inaccurate reporting about Philadelphia by New York-based reporters. China Foreign countries, such as China, have also been referred to as a \\"sixth borough.\\" In China's instance, it is referred to as the \\"sixth borough\\" by some media because many Chinese companies invest in developments in Brooklyn, such as Pacific Park. Other uses Manhattan College, located in Riverdale, Bronx, refers to its Jaspers student cheering section as \\"The 6th Borough\\" at home basketball games played in Draddy Gymnasium. In addition, the University of Connecticut (UConn) has often promoted its Huskies sports teams, especially in men's basketball, as \\"the Sixth Borough\\", given the dominance of that team in games played at Madison Square Garden. UConn also sells a T-shirt making this claim. Jonathan Safran Foer published a short story about a fictional sixth borough, an island that gradually floated away. The story was featured in his novel Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.

On 27 October 2016, the game was released for Microsoft Windows on Steam and GOG.com. Plot In the western shore of Norway, a widowed woman named Karen lives in a cabin in the woods with her son Espen. Somewhat estranged from each other, Karen does not actively engage with Espen's various activities, and rather works on her own projects and take naps in the majority of the day because she is working late. Despite Karen's warnings, Espen walks to an old rickety pier and suddenly disappears. Karen runs after and discovers that a mysterious old man who calls himself Old Erik, an old Norwegian name for the devil, has kidnapped Espen. She swims after his old boat to a mysterious island where she sees that, oddly, the moon has been shattered. Karen is confronted and hunted by various dangerous creatures and monsters such as trolls, Huldra, and mythological talking wolves from Norse mythology and Norwegian folk tales. She sees old ruined villages where the people have mostly vanished or dead and the very few humans she meets have either been driven insane by grief and trauma, or commit suicide in front of her. Eventually it is revealed that Karen has entered a forgotten time that had stopped after \\"The Great War\\" or Ragnar√∂k. The great warrior Vidar was supposed to kill and destroy the World Eater known as Fenris, thus stopping their world being destroyed. However, Vidar was too injured to deliver the killing blow. Vidar and Fenris instead make a pact: Leave Hodimir's holt, the last remaining place, alone and they will do anything. Fenris agrees on the condition that he gets a child sacrificed to him an every odd number of years. In the end, the island is empty of children due to its monstrous dangers, as well as diseases and starvation, thus pushing the people to insanity and trauma after the aftermath of The War. The islander called \\"Old Erik\\", who reluctantly took the role to take the children to the giant maws of Fenris, learns that there is a way to travel across worlds and entered into our world. However his actions were discovered by Fenris, who demanded more children more often or he would wake up and eat the rest of the world. Now that he knows about the world Karen and Espen came from, he wishes to eat that one too. It is also revealed that Karen accidentally hurt Espen repeatedly, causing her husband to file in for a divorce and full custody of Espen, but Karen warped the truth to keep her child, causing the blame for abuse to fall on her husband. After the trial was done, her husband committed suicide, causing Karen to feel great shame. Finally, after several close calls, Karen finally catches up with Espen and Old Erik near the mountainous jaws of Fenris. However Espen has already accepted that he needs to be sacrificed in order to delay the unavoidable, despite Karen's cries of protest pleading to him to come back to her. They try to catch him, but is too late as both Old Erik and Karen fall down into the watery grave of Fenris' jaws. They all return to the new world. Old Erik has died, and Karen tries to perform CPR on Espen but it is too late. Karen knows that Espen's sacrifice only delayed the full apocalypse by a few years, and that Fenris will require more children eventually. To honor her son's sacrifice, Karen has to pick up the mantle of Old Erik because the instant the pact is broken, every child sacrificed will have been for nothing, and she will not let that happen. Gameplay The game features interesting lighting and sounds that plays tricks on, and deceives the player. As the player explores the woods they will find many hidden caves and passageways containing secrets about the island where the game takes place. The main character is only equipped with a flashlight and will need this and sneaking skills to get past the creature inhabiting this grim place. Development The game was developed by the Norwegian studio Antagonist and started out as a student project. Antagonist began full production in July 2014. It won the \\"Sound of the Year\\" award at the Norwegian GAME Awards, 19 February 2015. A Kickstarter ran from 14 May 2015 - 14 June 2015 with the goal of $40,000. They exceeded their goal with $43,833 from 1,272 backers. The game was greenlit by the Steam Community. The development team consists of Dan Wakefield (Sound designer and writer), Stian Willums (art director and character artist), Torje Dreng Andersen (environment artist), Eirik R. A. Hanssen (programmer) and Torstein Vien (programmer). It was released in May 2018 for PS4 & Xbox One .

Weaver. It was published in paperback format by Wilfrid Laurier University Press in 2004. Hard Choices received favorable reviews in academic journals including Great Plains Research: A Journal of Natural and Social Sciences, Environmental Reviews, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, and Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. Contents summary Hard Choices: Climate Change in Canada is presented as a work to help address societal questions surrounding climate change in Canada and the inherent problems caused by its impact. Editors Harold Coward and Andrew J. Weaver gathered together writers from Canada with backgrounds including humanism, social science, and engineering. These individuals contributed articles to the book assessing the effects of climate change in Canada and how it would result in changes on the levels of technology, society, finance, politics, and religion. A collaborative work, Hard Choices engages with multiple topics to provide information from multiple different perspectives together in one source. Contributors to the work grapple with the Kyoto Protocol, the reaction by the government of Canada to this international treaty, and the effectiveness of the treaty to society overall with respect to the issues posed by changes in the climate of the planet. Research Research on Hard Choices was sponsored by the Centre for Studies in Religion and Society of the University of Victoria. Publication history Hard Choices was first published in 2004 by Wilfrid Laurier University Press. It was published the same year as an eBook. A 2005 edition was published in German. A later eBook edition was released in 2006 in English. Reception A review in Great Plains Research: A Journal of Natural and Social Sciences by Matthew Bramley wrote: \\"Hard Choices does cover the ground quite well, reviewing climate science, impacts, adaptation, technology, policy, law, equity, and ethics.\\" The review criticized some of the essays for being a bit outdated, while others were considered timely. Writing in the journal Environmental Reviews, Barry G. Rabe reviewed the book and commented: \\"It is one of those relatively rare edited collections that fits varied pieces into an appropriate package and, in the process, makes a profoundly important contribution to our understanding of climate change, particularly in the context of Canada.\\" Robert Balling reviewed the book for the journal Annals of the Association of American Geographers and wrote: \\"Hard Choices is very well written, free of errors, and nicely illustrated with many color maps and diagrams.\\" Balling concluded: \\"I recommend the book to scholars, students, and policy makers who have interests in Canada, climate change, and humanistic dimensions of difficult environmental choices.\\" Hard Choices was reviewed in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society by Tom G. Brydges. The review observed: \\"Twenty highly qualified authors have contributed twelve chapters plus a summary that cover climate change in Canada from the basic science through politics, economics, and religion to national and international law. Hard questions regarding the value of emission controls versus adaptation to inevitable climate change are thoroughly discussed.\\" Brydges strongly endorsed the work as a resource for those engaging in climate change politics on the global playing field, concluding: \\"This book should be mandatory reading for all future negotiators.\\" See also *Arctic Climate Impact Assessment *Climate change in the Arctic *Climate change in Canada *Environmental issues in Canada *List of countries by greenhouse gas emissions per capita References External links *Hard Choices at website of Wilfrid Laurier University Press Category:2004 non-fiction books Category:2004 in the environment Category:Books about Canada Category:Climate change books Category:Climate change in Canada ","title":"Hard Choices (Coward book)"},{"id":"45707876","text":"Baoshan is a given name.

Life Carel Beschey was born in Antwerp the son of Jacob Beschey and Maria-Theresia Huaert.Jacob Andries Beschey at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Carel Beschey at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Carel had three brothers who all became painters. The best known was Balthasar who was a landscape, history and portrait painter. His younger brothers were Jacob Andries, a history painter, and Jan Frans, a copyist and art dealer.

At his brother‚Äôs house, art lovers regularly met up to study the work of the great Dutch and Flemish masters.Pair of winter and summer landscapes sold at Sotheby‚Äôs on 9 December 2009 in London, lot 5 It is not known when or where Carel Beschey died but it is assumed he died in Antwerp c. 1770. Work Carel Beschey painted mainly landscapes usually with many figures and occasionally with a religious scene. He was one of a number of Antwerp artists from the second half of the 17th century and the first half of the 18th century who painted landscapes in a style reminiscent of earlier Flemish landscape painting. In particular, the work of Jan Brueghel the Elder. These artists included, amongst others, Izaak van Oosten, Peeter Gijsels, Adriaen Frans Boudewyns, Pieter Bout, Joseph van Bredael and his brother Balthasar Beschey. What these artists had in common was that they liked to paint pleasant landscapes with peasant scenes in fresh colours, which exuded a bucolic sense of happiness. Most of their landscapes were populated with small figures in anecdotal poses set against a backdrop of a nice landscape or of some buildings.About Theobald Michau at Jean Moust The preferred palette was pronounced blue-green.Carel Beschey, Landscape with buildings, a market, wagons and figures at Hampel Fine Art Auctions Landscape with figures The landscapes of Carel Beschey are closely based on the work of Jan Brueghel the Elder. Carel Beschey had a preference for wide, rural landscapes in which the rich scenery with farmers and travellers clearly evokes the model of landscape painting of the 17th century.Carel Beschey (1710‚Äì1786), The Rest on the Flight into Egypt at Bonhams Beschey painted a few pairs of winter and summer landscapes. His winter landscapes display a greater level of independence from the Brueghel model. An example is A winter landscape with hunters and skaters on a frozen river running through a village (sold at Sotheby's on 9 December 2009 in London, lot 5).

Hogels are similar to a sub-aperture image in a plenoptic radiance image, in that a hogel represents both the direction and intensity of light within a frustum from a given point on the light-field display plane. The resulting projected light-field is full parallax, allowing the viewer a perspective correct visualization within the light-field display view volume. Hogel image plane with rendered hogel volume highlighted in red. The HPU is separated from the host CPU (or GPU) by an expandable, interconnect framework and provides many views (hogels) into a scene per scene frame. The HPU is physically located in close proximity to the photonic modulation layer of a light-field display and has direct write access to the modulation driver back- buffers. This reduces the complexity of an HPU interconnect framework and allows the HPU processing pipeline to be as short and efficient as possible. Synthetic light-field rays are typically rendered as part of a hogel (2D array of rays/RGB pixels) using double-frustum rasterization or ray-tracing/ray- casting algorithms. These hogel rendering algorithms are greatly accelerated by the use of off-the-shelf (OTS) GPUs, however, there exists a substantial gap between real-time light-field rendering needs in terms of frame-rate, power and form factor requirements and modern GPU capability. The computed hogel light-field display requires as input a streaming 3D scene and a modeled/virtual display plane for visualization. The light-field display plane is a 2D array of microlens; hogels are computed at the center of every lens from the perspective of a virtual display plane in model space. 3D operations such as pan, scale, zoom, tilt and rotate are accomplished by transforming the virtual display plane through model space. For every light-field display update, every hogel must be updated or rendered. Therefore, if a light-field display had an array of 600 √ó 600 hogels, then the HPUs would have to compute 360,000 hogels per update. If each hogel had a directional/angular resolution of 512x512 rays/pixels, then the HPU array would be generating 94,371,840,000 pixels (283,115,520,00 bytes) per update. At 30 display updates per second (DPS), this equates to 2,831,155,200,000 unique pixels every second for dynamic scenes. Hogel processing unit overview HPU parallelism Since many (possibly hundreds) HPUs would be required to drive a single light-field display, it is important that the HPU be an independent processor, requiring minimal support logic and interconnect. The HPU interconnect framework should provide scene, command and sync buffering and relay throughout the topology. Ideally, neither the host system nor the individual HPUs would have knowledge of the interconnect topology or even the depth and breadth of the system. Hogel parallelism (multivew point rendering) A critical component of the HPU is the rendering of multiple viewpoints (hogels) in parallel per rendering pass of the geometry to take advantage of vertex and texture cache coherency.

It was released for Microsoft Windows on August 21, 2015. The game received attention in the video game industry for its unique premise: a multiplayer game that has a finite lifespan for all players. Due to the poor financial performance of the game, the central servers were shut down without player deaths reaching the set limit. Gameplay The Flock is an asymmetrical multiplayer video game that is played from a first-person perspective. The player defeats enemies with light. Enemies have the ability to turn into statues and become invincible. Certain artifacts will give players special abilities, such as the ability to run faster, jump higher, and remain undetected. The game contains a mixture of action and stealth. The player's flashlight can give away their position to enemies. When players lose their lives in the game, the population of the game decreases. When all players die, the game's online portion is no longer functional and, according to the game's developer, the game will \\"never be purchasable again.\\" Plot The game starts with the player controlling a creature in a flock. They can find an artifact which will turn them into a human, although other monsters will try to steal the artifact. Development The game was developed by the Dutch studio Vogelsap. It was first announced on May 30, 2013. The first trailer was unveiled on April 18, 2014. Reception Based on five reviews, Metacritic gave The Flock an aggregated review score of 36 out of 100, citing generally unfavorable reviews.

Set in the period from 1828 to 1865, it is a historical novel telling the fictionalised biography of Robert FitzRoy, who was given command of HMS Beagle halfway through her first voyage. He subsequently captained her during the vessel‚Äôs famous second voyage, on which Charles Darwin travelled as his companion. The novel was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize. Its title comes from Prospero's line \\"This thing of darkness I acknowledge mine\\" in Act V, Scene 1 of William Shakespeare‚Äôs The Tempest. Historical background Born to an aristocratic family, Robert FitzRoy joined the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth aged 12 and entered the Royal Navy the following year, rising rapidly through the ranks. The novel begins in 1828 with the suicide of the commander of HMS Beagle, Pringle Stokes, and FitzRoy‚Äôs subsequent appointment as the vessel‚Äôs (temporary) captain at the age of twenty-three. Whilst conducting Beagle‚Äôs mission of surveying Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, during which he proved to be a meticulous surveyor, he captured four native Fuegians and brought them back to England when Beagle returned in October 1830. FitzRoy‚Äôs intention was that they should be educated and Christianised before being returned to their homelands, where they would be able to act as interpreters ‚Äì with the aim of establishing friendly relations between their fellow countrymen and the British ‚Äì and also use their new knowledge to improve the lives of their compatriots. The captives became celebrities and were presented to King William IV; one later died from smallpox. FitzRoy undertook the second voyage of Beagle to return the surviving three Fuegians, at considerable personal expense. He was accompanied by Charles Darwin, who by the end of the voyage had become famous in scientific circles as a result of the discoveries he made during it, and who also collected much of the material that was to underpin his evolutionary theories during these travels. Decades later, following the publication of The Origin of Species, FitzRoy ‚Äì a committed Christian ‚Äì regretted that he had facilitated Darwin‚Äôs research. On Beagle‚Äôs return to England, FitzRoy was elected as the Tory Member of Parliament for Durham. He was appointed to several official posts, amongst them becoming the second Governor of New Zealand. His attempts to treat the indigenous MƒÅori population equitably made him unpopular with the settlers and the New Zealand Company and he was recalled to England. FitzRoy was a pioneer of developing charts to allow weather predictions to be made; weather forecasting is named after his attempts at what he called \\"forecasting the weather\\". He published the world‚Äôs first daily weather forecasts in The Times in 1860 and also provided personal forecasts to Queen Victoria. He committed suicide in April 1865 as a result of depression and a combination of problems at the Meteorological Office, which he headed, and financial and health difficulties. Characters This Thing of Darkness includes a large cast of fictionalised historical persons. In addition to FitzRoy and Darwin, the characters include: * Bartholomew Sulivan, British naval officer and hydrographer * Boat Memory (original name unknown), a native Fuegian brought to England * Syms Covington, cabin boy on HMS Beagle and later a servant of Charles Darwin * Reverend George Packenham Despard, a missionary in the Falklands Islands * Fuegia Basket (original name yok'cushly), a native Fuegian girl brought to England * Jemmy Button (original name o'run-del'lico), a native Fuegian brought to England * Maria Isabella Smyth, second wife of Robert Fitzroy * Mary Henrietta O'Brien, first wife of Robert FitzRoy * Philip Parker King, British naval officer and explorer * Reverend Richard Matthews, a missionary in New Zealand * Robert McCormick British Royal Navy Ship's Surgeon, explorer and naturalist * Thomas Moore, governor of the Falklands Islands * William Sheppard, prospective parliamentary candidate * York Minster (original name el'leparu), a native Fuegian brought to England Critical reaction In The Independent on Sunday, Stephen Knight wrote: ‚ÄúA hybrid of novel-of-ideas and ripping yarn, This Thing of Darkness is more convincingly the latter. The crew's skirmishes with South American natives and a storm off the coast of Uruguay, presaged by wind-blown clouds of butterflies and moths, are beautifully managed set-pieces, pacy, gripping, and vividly chaotic‚Äù. He found the characterisation less effective, saying: ‚ÄúIf Thompson's tendency to spell out his characters' thoughts saves us from imagining a subtext, it does not make his creations more rounded. For all their musings, many only register as stereotypes, and, as a consequence, few deaths properly haunt the reader.‚Äù In The Independent, Roz Kaveney found Thompson to be ‚Äúwriting as much about relationships as ideas. His account of the prickly friendship of the Tory prig Fitzroy and the cold-hearted Radical Darwin owes much to other novels of naval life and their forced intimacies; the spirit of Patrick O'Brian is often not far away‚Äù. Kaveney was unconvinced by aspects of the novel, saying: ‚ÄúPart of the trouble here is that Thompson is adapting the historical record for the purposes of fiction and is free to load the evidence. He can make Fitzroy's belief in biblical inerrancy a refusal to ditch religion in the face of inconclusive evidence from geology and zoology, while omitting the concurrent debates about the nature of the biblical text. The historical Fitzroy chose to ignore several sorts of evidence. Thompson also portrays Darwin as more racist in the modern sense than Fitzroy, again by shuffling his deck of facts.‚Äù She concluded that ‚ÄúThis Thing of Darkness is two sorts of book: a superior adventure story and a polemic. One can enjoy the former considerably while noting that the manners of the latter are wanting.‚Äù Robert Colvile, writing in The Observer was more impressed, finding: ‚ÄúThe bare facts of Charles Darwin's voyage to the Galapagos, and his formulation of the theory of natural selection, are well known. It takes an expert author to make a new pattern from such familiar cloth, yet this is precisely what Harry Thompson has done. [‚Ä¶] While rarely lyrical, Thompson's prose drives the reader through the 750 pages with the unstoppable force of an ocean current, fusing brisk action, challenging ideas and gut-wrenching emotion into an astonishingly assured debut - and memorial‚Äù.

The game was released on March 15, 2016 for the PlayStation 4, with later releases for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. It is heavily inspired by the Souls series by Japanese developer FromSoftware. The game received positive reception from critics, who praised its graphical style and gameplay. Gameplay The game features 2D hand drawn visuals, as well as gameplay mechanics similar to the Souls series. There are 600 items players may use, and the several weapon categories have special movesets including air attacks. Players can wield two handed weapons for additional power, and shields to defend and parry. Magic and ranged attacks can also be performed. The game implements RPG concepts such as origins, classes and stat development, as well as an extensive skill tree providing hundreds of combinations. The game also provides a multiplayer option, and asynchronous features such as messages that may be interchanged between players. Multiplayer allows for co-operative and versus play, but it is local only.  Plot  The game begins with the player stowed away in a ship that is also carrying a princess from an unnamed country who is to be married to an opposing country's king in order to avert war. However, a group of marauders attack the ship, murdering its crew. If the player kills all the marauders and escapes to the deck, they are then set upon by a giant \\"Kraekan\\" (a corruption of kraken) of the sea resembling Cthulhu. Whether or not they are able to defeat the marauders and the powerful kraeken, the ship is wrecked, sending them drifting to shore on a mysterious island. There, the player meets a strange old man who gives them an icon of one of three creeds the player says they are a member of, helping them in their quest to find the lost princess. The player places this icon in the first Sanctuary and then continues exploring the island, gathering salt in order to gain power, as in this universe, humans are known as Saltborn and are ostensibly largely composed of it. There, it is possible to meet several NPC's with side- stories, an unnamed Knight, Thief, and Sorcerer. The player also meets a highly sinister talking Scarecrow that threatens that they will perish. In the process of conversing with these NPCs throughout the journey, they come to realize that the island is made up of copies of dangerous locations from the various continents of the world, and that some kind of power \\"collected\\" them. The player realizes that the Scarecrow is the avatar of a being known as the Nameless God, and also that the princess they were searching for may not have even been royalty, but rather a slave that was to be sacrificed to the Nameless God in exchange for ending the current war, as has been done many times in the past. An optional boss fight also reveals that the Nameless God has killed the current gods of the world, known as the Three, by trapping them in special coffins and receiving and answering prayers meant for them, as gods require worship to survive. Finally, the main character meets the old man for the final time, and he reveals that he was once Jaret, a great king who once ruled the island and agreed to be the servant of the Nameless God in exchange for power. The Nameless God is an incredibly powerful being who is Saltborn (i.e. mortal), but desires to be a divine being, yet is unable to no matter how much power he collects due to him not having a soul of fire like other gods. The player travels to the Nameless God's castle and defeats him, finding a well with which they are able to escape from the island and presumably end the cycle of war that the Nameless God perpetuated. Alternatively, they can choose to pick up the Nameless God's helmet and gain his full power, but be trapped on the island. Development The game was first announced in an open letter from the developer to the PlayStation Blog on August 28, 2014. The game was released for the PlayStation 4 worldwide on March 15, 2016, and for Microsoft Windows on May 17, 2016. The game also released on PlayStation Vita on March 28, 2017. A Nintendo Switch port, handled by BlitWorks, was released worldwide on August 2, 2018 via the Nintendo eShop, with a physical retail released on December 11, 2018 under the title Salt and Sanctuary: Drowned Tome Edition. The initial idea behind the game was conceived as a fusion of the combat of the Souls series with the studio's previous Dishwasher series. The Castlevania series, particularly Symphony of the Night and the later Nintendo DS installments (which are noted for their free-roaming exploration-based design), also served as inspiration for the gameplay. The tech demo received a large amount of positive feedback, so the developers decided to continue with that idea. The game took about two and a half years to develop, though the underlying systems were created before development started in earnest. The original game as designed was much more complex, but some cuts had to be made due to the small size of the development team. Reception Salt and Sanctuary received \\"generally favorable\\" reception, according to review aggregator Metacritic. IGN awarded it a score of 8.6 out of 10, saying \\"You could call Salt and Sanctuary a 2D mashup of Dark Souls and Castlevania, and you'd be right. But such a simple pronouncement would be a disservice to the tremendous amount of thought that's gone into Salt and Sanctuary, whether it's in the graphic style that evokes horror through the style of comic strips or in the intricate web of dungeons and castles serves as it[s] map.\\" Pascal Tekaia of RPGamer rated the game 4.5/5, calling it \\"a remarkable fusion of several distinct styles\\" and \\"more than just a passable clone\\", while expressing dismay at the minimalist storyline and what he called \\"cheap deaths\\". Griffin McElroy of Polygon rated the game 9/10, saying that it accomplished the \\"impossible\\" feat of \\"borrow[ing] the mechanics of another game franchise without getting lost in derivation\\". He called the game a \\"loving\\" adaptation that rivals even its source material.

Demographics  According to 2011 census, Eragudi had a population of 6472 with a sex-ratio of 1,032 females for every 1,000 males, much above the national average of 929.[3] A total of 487 were under the age of six. The average literacy of the town was 58.96%, compared to the national average of 72.99%.[3] The town had a total of : 4826 households. There were a total of 396 workers, 5280 main agricultural labourers.  Economy  Most people in Eragudi were employed in the agriculture sector. Paddy and corn are the predominant crops grown in the area. Currently, the economy of this town is based on agricultural products. Eragudi is one of the very few towns in Tamil Nadu to have a high grade water management system. During the Monsoon, rain water from the nearby hills fill the lakes used to irrigate the surrounding agricultural lands. When the lake reaches its maximum level, safety valves are opened to drain the excess water into the neighbouring temple tank through an underground canal.  Transport  Eragudi is well connected by road to cities like Thuraiyur, Trichy, Namakkal, Musiri, Karur, and Attur .

World War II  The 83rd began forming on 11 February 1944 from the 61st and 85th Naval Rifle Brigades as part of the 31st Rifle Corps of the 26th Army of the Karelian Front, in accordance with an order of the 26th Army from 9 February. The division included the 11th, 26th, and 46th Rifle Regiments, the 588th Artillery Regiment, and smaller support units. The 1st and 3rd Separate Rifle Battalions of the 61st Brigade were used to form the 11th Rifle Regiment, the 2nd and 3rd Separate Rifle Battalions of the 85th Brigade were used to form the 26th Rifle Regiment, and the 2nd Separate Rifle Battalion of the 61st Brigade and 1st Separate Rifle Battalion of the 85th Brigade were used to form the 46th Rifle Regiment. The 588th Artillery Regiment was formed from the two batteries of 76 mm divisional guns included in each brigade.Combat Journal of the 83rd Rifle Division from 10 February 1944 Lieutenant Colonel Aleksey Mikhailovich Alekseyev, the commander of the 61st Brigade, became division commander. From 14 February, the 26th Rifle Regiment defended the previous positions of the 85th Brigade to the northwest of Lake Bolshoye Severnoye, between Ozero Nizhneye and Ozero Verkhneye Chernoye, opposite the German 6th SS Mountain Division Nord, which held positions to the north of Kestenga.

There was little action during this period, besides a near-daily mortar barrage by the 26th Rifle Regiment against the opposing German positions, sporadic exchanges of machine gun fire, and the uneventful sending out of reconnaissance patrols. During the night of 19‚Äì20 February, the 11th relieved the 26th and the 1st Battalion of the 46th on the defensive line. On the morning of 25 February three rifle companies of the 11th advanced to a line in direct contact with the opposing German troops, 150 to 200 meters away from the positions of the latter. The advance was conducted under sporadic rifle and machine gun fire, and German artillery and mortar fire at 08:00 wounded two soldiers of the regiment. A squad of 11 riflemen and anti-tank riflemen sent out on reconnaissance in front of the advanced positions at 17:00 were cut off by a German platoon and went missing.

The Seat of the European Central Bank, the ECB's new headquarters, was selected as the venue for the demonstration so as to highlight the contradiction between the ECB's lavish spending on its own US$1.4-billion building while forcing cuts and market reforms on countries like Greece and Cyprus. Ulrich Wilken, an organiser, said: ‚ÄúOur protest is against the ECB, as a member of the troika, that, despite the fact that it is not democratically elected, hinders the work of the Greek government.

Accessed 19 March 2015 On the other side of Frankfurt, around 3,000 attempted to break through the security fence of the ECB. At least 350 people were arrested, and 280 people were injured, among them 150 police officers and 130 protesters from Blockupy. Violent scenes were reported. Organisers said police sparked this violence with provocative actions, and described it as \\"not what Blockupy planned\\", while the Gewerkschaft der Polizei police union claimed that the violent protesters were organized and rejected claims of provocation. The leader of the Hesse branch of the Linkspartei, a member of the Blockupy alliance, said that the Blockupy movement had \\"failed\\" in its aim to offer peaceful protest and had brought the wider anti-capitalist movement into disrepute, a claim which was rejected by some of his party colleagues. The Blockupy representative from the Attac group described themselves as \\"appalled and saddened by some actions\\", but said that the majority of the protest was justified civil disobedience. Blockupy organizers from the Ums Ganze and Interventionist Left groups explicitly refused to distance themselves from the violence and expressed joy over the events. Alongside the official members of the Blockupy alliance, the protests were also possibly attended by small groups at the opposite end of the political spectrum, including members of the far-right and neo-Nazis, although their number has not been determined. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution announced an investigation into whether the uninvited right-wing groups played a role in the violence that followed. left Protesters attacked police officers with stones ahead of the demonstration. Video footage showed police dragging at least one person away. Police used tear gas, water cannons and pepper spray against people in the ECB area, and in turn reported that \\"pepper spray or an acidic liquid\\" had been used against officers. As well as the action against the ECB, some attendees also targeted private cars, shops, banks, firefighters and transport infrastructure. Eight bus and tram stops were vandalised, causing around ‚Ç¨50,000 of damage, and trams and fire engines were attacked with stones. According to police figures, 30 cars, including some police vehicles, were set on fire. A home for refugees was also supposedly attacked and staff threatened, which later turned out to be incorrect.

He began his career working for various newspapers in New York and New Jersey before moving to California in the 1940s for health reasons. There, he published the Beverly Hills Bulletin before taking a job as then-U.S. Representative Richard Nixon's press secretary. After Nixon's success senate campaign in 1950, Yacenda moved to Las Vegas where he became editor of the Las Vegas Sun. Yacenda subsequently worked on the re-election campaign of Governor Charles H. Russell before founding the North Las Vegas based Valley Times in 1959 as a weekly publication. As publisher of the new paper, he became an advocate for the city's growth. The paper grew quickly, becoming a tri-weekly before Yacenda decided to sell the paper to Bob Brown in 1973 for health reasons. Yacenda remained political and socially active. He continued to write for several Las Vegas publications, worked as a close adviser to Oran Gragson on four successful election campaigns, and helped to establish the North Las Vegas Library. Yacenda died in Houston in 1986 while awaiting heart surgery. Career Adam John Yacenda was born December 17, 1915, in Jersey City, New Jersey. He began his career as a stringer for the New York World-Telegram before spending time at several New Jersey newspapers. He moved to California during World War II for health reasons. There, he took a job publishing the Beverly Hills Bulletin for owner Will Rogers, Jr.. In 1950, Yacenda became then-congressman Richard Nixon's press secretary. After leading Nixon's successful senate campaign over Helen Gahagan Douglas, Yacenda moved to Las Vegas in search of a warmer climate. He interviewed with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, but neither party was very interested. Instead, Yacenda took a job as a reporter for the recently founded Las Vegas Sun. Two years later, he was promoted to editor. In 1954, Yacenda left the Sun to work on the re-election campaign of Republican Governor Charles H. Russell. He was slated to run the governor's office after the campaign. However, late in the campaign the Sun published a story alleging corruption by Russell's opponent, Vail Pittman, which helped ensure re- election. Russell thus felt a high ranking position in his government for Yacenda would look like a payoff, and Yacenda returned to the Sun as managing editor instead. In late 1958, Yacenda grew tired of Sun owner Hank Greenspun and other executives interfering with the daily operations of the paper and resigned in order to found a paper in his hometown, North Las Vegas. On March 26, 1959, the first issue of the weekly North Las Vegas and Moapa Valley Times was published, named for the two areas it aimed to serve. (The name was soon shortened to simply Valley Times.) Through his paper, whose mission statement read \\"A Newspaper Dedicated to Serving the People\\", Yacenda became an active promoter of growth in North Las Vegas. His locally oriented column, \\"Adam's Atoms\\", was published on the front page of his paper for several years. The Valley Times quickly surpassed its rival North Las Vegas News, published by Greenspun, and in November the two papers merged. Under Yacenda's leadership, the paper continued to grow. In 1963, it moved to twice weekly publication. Explaining the growth years later, reporter Bruce Hasley remarked \\"[Yacenda] really understood how to make a small community paper succeed. I will never forget his hammering away at photos of children and dogs and getting as many names of local people in the paper as we could.\\" The Valley Times expanded to tri-weekly publication in 1973, but North Las Vegas never saw the growth Yacenda had envisioned. The city council was in turmoil and the community received little support from the state government which did not view it as having a unique identity separate from Las Vegas. Facing heart surgery for a defective heart valve, Yacenda sold his paper to Bob Brown in November 1973. Upon the sale, Brown described Yacenda as \\"one of Nevada's outstanding newspaperman. He has done an amazing job building the Valley Times against tremendous odds ...Adam Yacenda has made the Valley Times a very successful and widely read newspaper.\\" Yacenda remained politically active throughout his life. He was a close adviser to Oran Gragson on his four successful campaigns for Las Vegas mayor and an unsuccessful bid for governor in 1962. As Yacenda aged, he found the Democratic Party to be a better fit to his ideology and switched his allegiance. He was asked by the Democratic Party to run for a state senate seat in 1966, but declined the invitation. He attempted to aid Democrats Ed Fike and Mike O'Callaghan in late 1960s election campaigns, but was blocked by the party who felt he was too independent. In 1986, Hasley recalled, \\"[Yacenda] had one of the shrewdest political minds around ... a lot of people in office today owe their careers to him.\\" After selling the Valley Times, Yacenda contributed to a variety of Las Vegas area publications, including helping with the Sun youth forum in 1984. Yacenda remained active in the North Las Vegas community until his death. He is credited for being a key figure in creation of North Las Vegas Library, which he donated both his time and money to. Death and legacy Yacenda died in Houston, Texas, on June 13, 1986, while awaiting heart surgery. His funeral was held in Los Angeles where much of his immediate family lived at the time. Upon his death, Las Vegas Today editor Norma Staley described Yacenda as \\"a first class journalist [and] a super human being.\\" Gragson credited Yacenda for his political success and described him as \\"a close associate and dear friend ... he was one of few who believed I had a chance\\" to win the mayor's office. \\"He was a credit to his profession and a stickler about facts\\", he added. Personal life Yacenda's brother, Rudy, worked with him at the Las Vegas Sun in the accounting department.

The LA-based media outlet reports on Hip- Hop and urban music, culture, sports and lifestyle news via in-depth video interviews and long-length editorial features. History As a fifteen-year veteran in the music industry, Nick Huff Barili recognized the need for credible in-depth coverage of Hip-Hop culture and the emergence of new media, and set to launch Hard Knock TV as the first Hip-Hop show on YouTube. He originally pitched the idea of starting a web-based video series to a large agency in Los Angeles, but they assured him that people would prefer to watch content on television, rather than on the internet. Despite the feedback, Nick Huff Barili decided to launch Hard Knock TV independently on YouTube. Hard Knock TV initially gained notoriety for discovering and interviewing emerging talent in the Los Angeles area, one of which being K-Dot (now known as Kendrick Lamar). Hard Knock TV's video content en masse currently has over 70-million views, and its YouTube channel has over 140 thousand subscribers. Content Hard Knock TV's trademark is providing quality, in-depth interviews with Hip-Hops biggest and brightest stars, as well producers and industry influencers.

Some of the artists interviewed for written features include Dilated People, Lil Bibby, DJ Mustard, Sir Michael Rocks, Audio Push, Fashawn, Jarren Benton, Killer Mike, Thurz, G-Eazy, and many more. Some Hard Knock TV videos have gone viral, racking up slightly more views than the rest. Some of those videos include A$AP Rocky, who spoke about interracial dating, homeless shelters, and homophobia; Hopsin, who addressed other rappers Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar, and how \\"diss Hip-Hop\\" is back; Ne-Yo, who talked about the at-the-time beef with Chris Brown; Kendrick Lamar, who touched on smoking weed, Tupac, and Compton; Scarface, who talks about how Hip-Hop \\"is white now\\"; and Nas in an interview where he discussed fellow artists, Drake, J.

Hard Knock Hoops & SXSW Hard Knock Hoops is an annual three-on-three celebrity basketball tournament organized by Hard Knock TV. The annual tournament takes place in Austin, TX during the SXSW music festival and in Los Angeles in the summer time. The first tournament took place at SXSW in 2011 and was called \\"Hoop & Hang,\\" a collaboration between Nick Huff Barili of Hard Knock TV and Gotty of The Smoking Section. Nick first approached him with the idea at the 2010 World Basketball Festival in NY, and with Gotty, went on to create a space at SXSW where artists and media could get together in a more intimate setting while sharing their love for music and basketball. The first annual LA Hard Knock Hoops tournament took place in 2012 as part of Hard Knock TV's 7 Year Anniversary Celebration, which was sponsored by Nike, and it is still held annually by Hard Knock TV. However, wanting to focus on its own brand and vision, Hard Knock TV ended its SXSW \\"Hoop & Hang\\" collaboration with TSS and carried on its own tournament at SXSW as Hard Knock Hoops in 2014. Every year Hard Knock hoops has grown: The star-studded 2014 Hard Knock Hoops tournament in Los Angeles saw the likes of Chris Brown, Game, Taco (of Odd Future), Quincy, Steelo Brim, Pac Div, Thurz, DJ Khalil, DJ Bizzy and Ben Lyons among other industry influencers all going head to head for the chance to take home that prized number one slot.

White (1917‚Äì2002) was an American modernist architect and industrial designer who worked in the Coachella Valley, CA in the 1950s and the Colorado Springs, CO area in the 1960s. White is noted for influencing innovative roofing and window systems in early Palm Desert, CA architecture. Between 1933 and 1936 he attended San Bernardino High School. White worked for six months in 1937 for Harwell Hamilton Harris, followed by eight-months with Rudolf Schindler‚Äôs Los Angeles office during 1937-1938. White subsequently worked for Allen Kelly Rouff for six months between 1938 and 1939. Between 1939 and 1942, he worked for Win E. Wilson for two years and six months, helping to plan and design prefabricated war housing with a skin-stressed plywood panel system. In his papers, White recounts that over 8,000 of these units were constructed in the United States. For the remainder of the war, White was employed by the Douglass Aircraft Co. in El Segundo, California, working on machine tool design for four years and six months (1942-1946). In 1947 he moved from Los Angeles to Palm Springs where he worked for Clark & Frey Architects (1947-1948). Starting in 1948, White began to work on his own as a designer and contractor in Colorado Springs, Colorado where he continued to practice as a contractor until 1965. He obtained his architecture license in Colorado Springs in 1967. He returned to California and worked there during the 1970s and 1980s. Reflecting on his career, White described the variety of buildings he designed: ‚Äú300 residences, 40 recreation homes, ski lodges, commercial buildings, churches, luxurious club houses and guest rooms, and condominiums. Of the 300 residences designed I have built approximately 15% of them myself.‚Äù In addition to designing houses, White devoted much of his career to the research and development of the Solar Heat Exchanger Window Wall and the \\"Hyperboloic Paraboloid Roof Structure and Method of Constructing Thereof\\" ‚Äì- both of which he patented, in 1975 and 1996 respectively. Walter S. White died in 2002, at the age of 85.

The software‚Äôs core technology, the Music Molecule, visualizes patterns and relationships between MIDI notes and allows users to create and edit note clusters and patterns rather than individual notes. Liquid Rhythm operates as a standalone program for macOS and Windows, and as a DAW plug-in in the Max for Live, VST, AU, and RTAS formats.  The Music Molecule  Liquid Rhythm is based on WaveDNA‚Äôs patented Music Molecule technology, which visualizes notes and rests in BeatForms. BeatForms are one 8th note long with the number of note events indicated by the colour of the BeatForm: red BeatForms contain three note events, blue BeatForms contain two note events, and purple BeatForms contain one. BarForms are groups of BeatForms that are one bar in length. By grouping these notes into modular containers, the Music Molecule provides structure to raw MIDI and captures the relationships between notes. The Music Molecule engine is patented in both the USA and Canada.  Features  Liquid Rhythm‚Äôs main ‚Äòview‚Äô is the Arranger window, where users can create and edit BarForms and BeatForms. Users begin by selecting an instrument and dragging it onto a slot in the Arranger. There are a wide selection of genre-based sounds, ranging from Acoustic to Techno, within the program. Users can import custom sample libraries as well. There are a number of features in the software for the formulation of entire BarForms as well as for editing minuscule details of the rhythms. Liquid Rhythm populates the BarForm List with commonly occurring BarForms for the chosen instrument and includes a number of filters to refine the selection. Below the BarForm List is the BeatForm Sequencer, a grid that allows users to insert different BeatForms into each of the eight sections in the selected BarForm. The other BarForm creation tool is the BeatWeaver, wherein the user chooses a series of BeatForms and the BeatWeaver creates every possible combination that can be weaved into a BarForm. The Accent Modifiers set the MIDI velocity and timing based on the BeatForm accent color as well as give users the ability set a range to ‚Äúhumanize‚Äù velocity and timing. The GrooveMover changes the arrangement of notes in the bar and the BeatForm Tumblers increases the complexity of a rhythm selection. The Randomizer will populate a selected portion of the Arranger with a random rhythm created within user-set parameters.  Development  In the 1980s, Vice President and Lead Inventor at WaveDNA, David Beckford worked with The University of Toronto‚Äôs music cognition lab to study how musicians visualize and conceptualize music. This led to his extensive work in trying to unify MIDI and traditional music notations into a new and integrated language for musicians. By 2009, David Beckford had developed a software prototype that allowed him to isolate and catalogue different rhythmic, melodic, and harmonic characteristics and manipulate them digitally. After partnering with Douglas Mummenhoff (CEO), the two founded WaveDNA.

Requebra was Fox's first Brazilian co-production and debuted in theaters on December 17, 1999. The show was watched by approximately 2,074,461 viewers and earned more than 8 million reais for its producers, according to Ancine.  Plot  The Dance Academy Two Hearts, where Nena (Xuxa Meneghel) studied, is in danger. The terrible Macedonian (Elke Maravilha), an inveterate smoker, bandit and businessman with the facade of a businesswoman, intends to take advantage of the Academy's bad financial situation to take over its facilities. But there is hope: the Requebra 2000 contest, the Millennium dance tournament, which takes place in Rio de Janeiro, and has a sponsor willing to give a large prize money that would solve the problem of the Academy. To win the tournament, the group has the indispensable help of Nena, a former student of the Academy and now a journalist of the famous daily Hora X. But Macedon is responsible for his stepson Felipe (Daniel), to hire professional dancers to beat them ruthlessly. In addition, he has Guto (Vitor Hugo) as his spy and uses his clumsy henchmen to sabotage the staff of the Dance Academy during the qualifiers.

There were several screenings, including one of which came to be worked as the comedy \\"Morrendo de Rir\\" that would be produced in 1994. Despite the various attempts, there were great difficulties for the realization of a new film, especially in the 90's where production of Brazilian films was weak. Requebra was an old project and had been working since 1996. That year, Xuxa announced that she would make her return to theaters, including in a Xuxa Hits, the blonde even told a bit about the story that would be a kind of continuation of Sonho de Ver√£o.< With the title of Very Crazy Holidays, the movie would feature as Paquitas New Generation, Adriana Bombom and the boys of You Can Dance who even got to record a song that would serve as the main theme. In the story, blonde stage assistants would live high school students on the brink of bankruptcy. Macedon (in the first version a man) would take advantage of the situation and try to dominate the area where the institution was constructed. With the help of a mysterious teacher (who would be played by Xuxa), the class would be eligible for a sports competition, whose prize money would save the college from debt. The film was scheduled for 1997 and much of the cast had already been defined as the participation of ex-paquitos Marcelo Faustini and Cl√°udio Heinrich. After difficulties due to the cost, the film curiously suffered modifications in its plot, mainly with the entrance of the actor Evandro Mesquita in the script. The story was told in a dance academy, but its title had been kept. Development The choice of who would give life to the character Felipe came from a research commissioned by the production of the film. Several options were given for the role, as for example the singer Alexandre Pires, however the public preferred the also singer Daniel. The exchange of the name of F√©rias Muito Loucas (Very Mad Holidays) for Requebra appeared during the recordings of the film after the singer Vinny show the song for the production. Music The soundtrack of the film of the same name, released in 1999 by Som Livre and Globo/Universal. The album consists of songs performed by the protagonist, the Brazilian presenter Xuxa Meneghel and other artists. The soundtrack to the film \\"Xuxa Requebra\\" was released in late 1999 shortly after the release of the film. The soundtrack brings various artists such as Fat Family, Claudinho & Buchecha, Daniel, M√∫ Carvalho and You Can Dance. The booklet is simple, without letters, only with the credits. Fat Family's version of the song \\"Chegou a Festa\\" is different from the group's CD version. And the song \\"M√£e √© uma S√≥\\", also of Fat Family, is the version of the reduction of the film that was not used. Reception The film Xuxa Requebra made the highest grossing of a national film, in the first week of exhibition, in the 1990s in the country. The film was watched by approximately 2,074,461 spectators and earned more than 8 million reais for its producers, according to Ancine. Critical reception Xuxa Requebra received generally negative from critics. Clara A of website Adoro Cinema was negative in her film critique, giving a star of five, The critical consensus of the site says: And so is Xuxa in the cinema: with a simple and predictable story that wins the taste of children, even more with the artists who were famous at the time. I felt in the true show of freshmen of Chacrinha. She also criticized the excess of singers who participated in the cast of the film saying: Every 20 minutes someone comes to Xuxa Break up someone to sing and make a point in the film, to increase even more success. Okay, that was nice at the time and it's a lot of relief, but calm down. She also criticized the couple formed by Xuxa and the singer Daniel saying: Not before, nor now nor at any time, Daniel was a gallant of something. And it's still the romantic pair of Xuxa. Appeal, is not it?. The critic of the site Folha de S.Paulo, was also negative in relation to the excess of participation of artists in the cast saying: \\"Xuxa Requebra\\" is less a movie and another commercial of two hours in duration. Basic concepts of cinema, such as history and narrative, do not seem to matter much. The goal is to squeeze as much merchandising as possible on the screen and advertise \\"TV\\" musicians and \\"celebrities\\" hired from the Xuxa company. He defined the film as \\"Inaugurated the cinema of accountant\\" For him \\"There is no script, but a bad sequence of scenes, written in a hurry to give each friend of Xuxa his 15 seconds (it's a lot of people!) fame.\\" He also criticized the script and the dialogue defining them as \\"bland\\" questioning \\"Can not anyone write something better than\\" if we win the contest, I promise to stay a year without eating popcorn \\"or\\" I thought it was 15 o'clock in the afternoon\\"?, The little humor of the film is totally involuntary and in bad taste\\". Ruy Gardnier of the Portal Contratempo wrote that the film 'is a disgusting \\"Manichaeism, a pamphlet that more mystifies than it informs (and it must be admitted that just what today's youth lack is information), an uplifting discourse that always reaches maximum happiness in the end.\\" for the critic, the phrase that most resonates at the end is \\"That was the choreography of the beating\\", is a sad and inconsequential flattery of the much-health-few-nerves generation, for whom, by the way, it seems that the film was made. He ended the assessment by saying that Xuxa Requebra is \\"the cavernous portrait of the health generation, and arrogating the right to make moral of the decisions of others with the pseudointuito to educate the children against drugs, against the cigarette ends up doing the times of prejudice, of pure capitalism (that tries to criticize), of the \\"bruise\\" and the magnificent life of the young healed dancing to the sound of Vinny's \\"Requebra\\" and being moved to the sound of the litanies of Daniel\\". International release Fox planned to launch the Requebra in July 2000 in Argentina, as far as we know the project has not gone out of print.

It is stated that the film is based upon actual events. The plot revolves around a Wiccan group, whose leader Uri Clef, and seven followers disappear. They were last seen at The Coven, a ring of trees in Queens Wood once used as a meeting place by practitioners of Cochrane's Craft. Some schoolkids are drawn to visit Queen's Wood in Highgate on Halloween. The film was finally released direct to DVD in the UK on 16 March 2015.  Plot  The film opens with a map of Queen‚Äôs Wood in Highgate. A burning tree appears in a dark night. A goats head is overlaid visually in the tree. The scene then moves to a school where Mr. Shears (Dexter Fletcher) is giving a lesson about Witchcraft. He holds a book with a title page containing the words ‚ÄòDiabolus quod igneus frutex‚Äô, meaning the devil is the fire tree. He asks the class ‚ÄòIs Wicca a religion or little more than devil worship‚Äô. He mentions that Robert Cochrane ‚Äòfounded a Wicca coven as recently as the 1960s‚Äô, and that his coven split up, but later reformed and met in the nearby Queens Wood at the titular coven, a particular ring of trees. He is interrupted by a Mrs. Belial, posing as a supply teacher who tells him that he needs to see the headmaster. He leaves and she takes over the lesson. She explains how there was a spiritual leader and politico, Uri Clef who went missing on Halloween with seven of his followers, and they were last thought to be in Queen‚Äôs Wood. Five of the girls decide to go into the Queens Wood on Halloween, on the way they are involved in a near miss with a biker while crossing a road. They enter the wood and discover the word Lucifer in ash upon the ground. They notice that their five names have first letters that are the letters of Lucifer. Izzy, one of the girls, adds their names in chalk underneath. As they put up their tent they are watched, apparently by the biker from earlier. The film then cuts to the lounge of one of the other girls in the class, Eve, who was not invited, she has found a nursery rhyme that states ‚ÄòYou can make him go away with a cross stick, you can make him go away with a shoe‚Äô. Her private tutor explains that it refers to the devil. He says that there are plague pits in Queen‚Äôs Wood and that those who were buried went to the devil. He asks \\"I wonder how the devil gets people now\\". Meanwhile, two boys, Eddie and Louie, decide to take a short cut across the park, but get lost. Their names fill out the two missing letters from the word Lucifer. Eddie climbs a tree for a better view, but is startled by a bat, falls, and is injured by landing on a horn, which Louie refers to as possibly belonging to a deer. Louie leaves him to get help. Meanwhile, Mrs. Belial alone in her flat is seen eating the raw meat of a bird. Later she constructs a model of The Coven out of earth and foliage, and places tin foil figures are inside. It appears that she is doing a magic spell on those in the wood. The biker picks off seven of the teenagers, including Eve, who has entered the wood after receiving a text asking for help. The fire tree reappears, and images of seven of the teenagers are shown being sucked into the tree. The name Lucifer on the ground of the coven is completed with the names of Louie and Eve, it is implied that Eddie is not taken by the biker and so survives. The film ends with the singing of the nursery rhyme.

Life In the 1960s, Iantzi's parents, Angel Iantzi and Txelo Mitxelena, emigrated from Lesaka in Spain to the United States, looking for a better lifestyle. They were there for about 23 years, thirteen years sheep farming and another ten years on a cattle ranch. Their three children were born in California and they lived in Dixon until they returned to Lesaka. Although the family made a good living in the US, they wanted to return to Lesaka because their family was there and the children had to be schooled. When Iantzi was seven years old, he spoke only English Basque, something that makes him very sensitive to the euskaltzale movement in spreading the use of the Basque language. Work in the media Iantzi auditioned for a programme on EITB Euskal Telebista. Later, Canal 4 gave him his first break. Before going onto a set he had worked in administration, insurance and in the catering sector. He has presented numerous programmes across different television channels, but has undoubtedly become most well-known presenting different shows on EITB such as Basetxea, Begia gose, Sorginen laratza, La flecha amarilla and El conquistador del fin del mundo. He has also presented programmes about Basque communities in the United States. In March 2007, he moved to national television, presenting the programme Brainiac on Cuatro. In summer 2008, he presented El muro infernal, the Spanish version of the successful format Hole in the wall of Fuji TV, on La Sexta. His last job before returning to EITB was with Antena 3, as a moderator in Vaya par... de tres, a programme presented by Mar√≠a Pati√±o and Jes√∫s Mari√±as. He returned to EITB to present new editions of El conquistador del fin del mundo, a show in which contestants have to deal with the toughest of conditions with the aim of placing a Basque flag on top of the lighthouse at the world's end - namely the Les Eclaireurs Lighthouse in Beagle Channel, Ushuaia, Argentina.

The foundation stone was laid on 19 December 1902, and dedicated by Bishop Charles Gore of Worcester on 3 October 1903. As the church was paid for entirely by Mrs Livingstone, the parish used funds allocated to a planned Mission Hall for Newtown to instead build the hall adjacent to the Church. The grounds have not been consecrated for burial. Exterior The design is in the Early English style with lancet windows, and features a stone relief of the Ascension by Harry Hems on the tower. Twelve yew trees line a path to the main South door. There is no other external decoration. The nave roof is of Cumberland slate and the stonework is from Guiting quarry in the Cotswolds. The tower contained two bells until the sixties, when they were sold to raise money for electrical work. Interior The high altar is of stone, a feature of the influence of the Oxford Movement, with a triptych hanging above it, which is closed during Lent. The saints portrayed on the triptych are connected with the life and work of Arthur Livingston: St Patrick (Irish ancestry); St Frideswide (depicted with Christchurch, Oxford, where Livingstone was educated); Hugh of Lincoln; The Venerable Bede, as Livingston was Canon of Durham; St Ethelreda of Ely and St Edmund of East Anglia, due to Livingstone's connection with Sudbury. This is the work of Sister Catherine Ruth of the All Saints' Community, Margaret St., London.

He has been employed at the California Institute of Technology since 2006, and is currently the Luis & Nelly Soux Professor of Microbiology in the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering. Before his current position, he was associated with the University of Chicago and Harvard Medical School. In 2012, Mazmanian was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship for his pioneering work on the human microbiome. Work Mazmanian's research investigates the symbiotic relationship between beneficial bacteria and their hosts. In seminal work, Mazmanian discovered the first microbial molecule that has direct beneficial effects on mammals. Working in Dennis Kasper's lab, he showed in 2005 that a particular bacterial species, Bacteroides fragilis, from the human microbiome augments immune function and balances a dysregulated immune system. Mazmanian has described and defined a novel paradigm in science whereby the gut microbiome intricately controls the development and function of the mammalian immune system. These discoveries include the demonstration that B. fragilis can treat experimental inflammatory bowel disease by inducing the activity of protective, regulatory immune cells. Further, his laboratory revealed that the gut microbiome impacts autoimmune diseases such as experimental multiple sclerosis.

It is approximately long and flows through Ransom Township in Lackawanna County and Duryea in Luzerne County. The watershed of the stream has an area of . It is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. The stream has one unnamed tributary. Many reaches of the stream have been affected by mining and abandoned mines. The surficial geology in its vicinity features alluvium, coal dumps, surface mining land, and Wisconsinan Till. Course Red Spring Run begins at the base of a mountain in Ransom Township, Lackawanna County. It flows south for several tenths of a mile before turning south-southeast for a short distance. The stream then turns south again, exiting Lackawanna County and entering Duryea, Luzerne County. It turns southwest for a few tenths of a mile before turning south-southwest for a few tenths of a mile. It then receives an unnamed tributary from the right and reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River. Red Spring Run joins the Lackawanna River upriver of its mouth. Tributaries Red Spring Run has no named tributaries. However, it does have one unnamed tributary, which is known as \\"Unnamed trib 1\\". Unnamed trib 1 is long. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Red Spring Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. The waters of Red Spring Run contribute to the flooding of abandoned gravel pits near Coxton. These pits are locally known as the Duryea Swamps. Red Spring Run and its unnamed tributary both begin in springs on a mountain known as West Mountain. In its upper reaches, the stream descends steeply until it reaches the floodplain of the Lackawanna River. As it flows downstream, Red Spring Run quickly becomes affected by abandoned mines. Some reaches of the stream have been entirely destroyed either by mining or by post-mining development. Its lower reaches are also affected by mining. The stream begins losing its flow upstream of Airport Sand and Gravel. Its mouth is in a concrete culvert. The headwaters of Red Spring Run are at the border between the Llewellyn Formation and the Pocono Formation. The surficial geology near the lower reaches of the stream mainly consists of alluvium (which contains stratified sand, silt, and gravel, as well as some boulders) and coal dumps. Further upstream, the surficial geology mostly features land that has been surface mined for coal, with some coal dumps to the east. Near the headwaters of the stream, there is surface mining land as well as a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till. Watershed The watershed of Red Spring Run has an area of . The watershed is in the southwestern part of the Lackawanna River watershed and in the lower reaches of that watershed. The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Pittston. Red Spring Run is a small, second-order stream. It is one of the last tributaries to enter the Lackawanna River. At one location, Red Spring Run flows through a small residential area that is part of the Connells Patch neighborhood. History and industries Red Spring Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1184798. The Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan also recommended that Ransom Township and the borough of Duryea include protection of Red Spring Run in their comprehensive plans, as well as their ordinances for land use, zoning, and subdivision. The Popple Brothers Colliery (formerly known as the Babylon Breaker) operates in the vicinity of Red Spring Run. Airport Sand and Gravel has an active quarry permit (#40900304) in the watershed. The Lehigh Valley Railroad historically crossed the stream near its mouth and the rail corridor still remains.

He said that the remaining community of Ethiopian Jews had established a synagogue, that the reports he received on the community were distressing, and that the Falash Mura remaining in Addis Ababa should be allowed to immigrate to Israel as well.Ethiopians Face Unclear Future as Immigration Ends The Jewish Daily Forward, 27 December 2007 He established the Atid Ehad (One Future) party, which contested the 2006 Knesset elections, but received only 0.4% of the vote and failed to win a seat. He subsequently joined the Jewish Home, and was placed eighth on its list for the 2009 elections.The Jewish Home list Central Elections Committee However, the party won only three seats and he did not become a Knesset member.

As a Member of the Knesset, he focuses on social issues such as helping new immigrants integrate into Israeli society, providing support and education for youth in underprivileged neighborhoods. \\"I want to make sure that laws passed in the Knesset are actually implemented, like the one requiring Ethiopian immigrants to be hired in government offices and government-owned companies,\\" he said. Neguise expressed confidence that the diversity of the incoming Knesset was a positive development: \\"We have representatives of women, new immigrants and Arabs, and I think we can all work together in the Knesset.\\" He has appealed to the Knesset not to wait until a coalition is formed to bring all Ethiopians Jews to Israel.MK Abraham Naguise: \\"Bring all Ethiopian Jews on aliya\\" Jerusalem Post, 19 April 2015 In April 2015, Neguise came to the defense of an Ethiopian-born soldier serving in the Israel Defense Forces who was beaten by a policeman in what was viewed as a racist attack which was caught on video. The soldier, Damas Pakedeh, was arrested on charges of attacking a police officer and then released. Pakada, an orphan who arrived with his siblings in 2008, claims the incident was racially motivated and that if the video had not been taken, he would have been punished. Instead, the police officer and volunteer were suspended pending an investigation. Neguise called on National Police Chief Yohanan Danino to prosecute the police officer and volunteer, saying they engaged in \\"a gross violation of the basic law of respecting others and their liberty by those who are supposed to protect us.\\"Video: Police suspended after assaulting IDF soldier in incident caught on tape The Jerusalem Post, 29 April 2015Cops beat Ethiopian IDF soldier in alleged racist attack The Times of Israel, 27 April 2015 In a 2016 interview with an American Jewish student newspaper, Neguise explained the value of Israel's Absorption Ministry: \\"It is responsible for absorbing new immigrants and helping them integrate into society. Be it is housing, employment, education, health and welfare. The government is ready to absorb millions of immigrants. I will tell you my story. I grew up as a shepherd in Ethiopia, I immigrated to Israel 31 years ago. I got an equal opportunity for education in Israel. While in Ethiopia I graduated from high school, here in Israel, I have five degrees, and I'm a legislator in Israel. I am one of the millions who settled here successfully.\\"When MKs attempt to speak English YNET News, March 27, 2016 References External links * * Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:People from Gondar Category:Ethiopian emigrants to Israel Category:Israeli people of Ethiopian-Jewish descent Category:Alumni of the University of Sussex Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni Category:Academic Center for Law and Science alumni Category:Swinburne University of Technology alumni Category:Israeli activists Category:Israeli Jews Category:Leaders of political parties in Israel Category:Israeli settlers Category:Likud politicians Category:Members of the 20th Knesset (2015‚Äì2019) ","title":"Avraham Neguise"},{"id":"45709164","text":"John C.

History  The Taylor House, built in the early 1850s by Judge David Taylor, a once prominent citizen in Sheboygan. Taylor was a circuit court judge and invested in the community in harbor development, railroads and many other community projects. He went on to the Wisconsin State Senate and the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The house became Sheboygan County property around 1900 and was later used for the Sheboygan County Sheriff's Office and jail from 1915 to 1936, when the Sheboygan County Courthouse was completed on the city's east side. The house was used by the caretaker of Taylor Park for many years and was leased to the Sheboygan County Historical Society in 1949. The Historical Society removed the jail equipment, including the bars from the windows and opened it as the county museum in 1954. Some of the exterior architectural details were removed or \\"updated\\" at that time and everything received a fresh coat of paint. A major landscaping plan was completed around the outside of the building. The museum was originally on the first floor. In the early 1970s, the museum expanded to the entire building. The Taylor House served as the main museum building until the new museum was opened in 1997. The Taylor House was land- marked locally and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.  Restoration  Major restoration work took place in 2006 to clean and tuck pointing the brick and included the removal of the 1950s front porch and building a replica of the 1850s formal front porch, repair of wood architectural features as well as the removal of the fire escape. Because the David Taylor House is on the National Register of Historic Places, there are specific guidelines required in the restoration work.

Ouyang became assistant lecturer at the College of the Four Gates at the Imperial Academy in 799 and held it until his death. Ouyang became an ardent participant in Han Yu's Classical Prose Movement. His writings have been compiled in ten volumes (). His poetry appears in a section of the compilation Quan Tangshi. Death Ouyang fell in love with a courtesan from Taiyuan. When his official duties forced him to leave her, he promised to return. However, she was unable to muster the patience required and died of loneliness. When Ouyang heard the news, he too died of grief. This story was recounted in Meng Jian's (Â≠üÁ∞°; jinshi 791) \\"Recounting Ouyang Xingzhou‚Äôs Affairs\\" (), a work about Ouyang's relationship with the courtesan that led to both of their deaths.

The program was sponsored by Colgate-Palmolive. The George Burns Show immediately followed the eight-season run of The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, which had aired on CBS, and shared continuity with the earlier series. Overview After Gracie Allen retired in 1958, George Burns tried to continue the old series without her, using many of the characters and settings from their show. In this new series, George was working as a producer in a downtown office, and trying to deal with an assortment of entertainers and oddball theatrical acts as well as his previously established friends. Blanche Morton (Bea Benaderet) was George's secretary, and was keeping George from fawning over attractive women, for Gracie's sake (Gracie was mentioned on the show, but never seen). Blanche's husband Harry Morton (Larry Keating) was George's accountant. Also present were Harry von Zell, Ronnie Burns, and Judi Meredith, all playing themselves. Meredith had appeared regularly as Ronnie's girlfriend Bonnie Sue MacAfee on the Burns and Allen Show in 1957 and 1958; here she played essentially the same role, but as herself. For the February 1959 sweeps, the format was changed to a live sketch-comedy/variety show in the style of The Jack Benny Program, in an attempt to improve the ratings. The ratings didn't improve, however, so they reverted to the sitcom format. The series ended after 25 episodes.

The Yard Goats, which play in the Eastern League, are the Double-A affiliate of the Colorado Rockies. The team was founded in 2016 when the New Britain Rock Cats relocated to Hartford. The Yard Goats' home stadium is Dunkin' Donuts Park. History The franchise's timeline can be traced back to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where they were a Boston Red Sox Double-A affiliate from 1965 to 1969. The franchise then moved to Pawtucket, Rhode Island, in 1970, where they spent three years. The Pawtucket Red Sox became a Triple-A team in 1973, and the Red Sox moved their Double-A franchise to Bristol, Connecticut. Known as the Bristol Red Sox, the team played at Muzzy Field for ten seasons from 1973 to 1982. Starting with the 1983 season, the team was moved east to New Britain, Connecticut. Then known as the New Britain Red Sox, the team played its home games at Beehive Field, which stood next to New Britain Stadium. Renamed the Rock Cats in 1997, the team remained in New Britain through the 2015 season. In 2016, the team moved to Hartford and became the Yard Goats. The Yard Goats were unable to play any games in Hartford in 2016 due to construction delays at Dunkin' Donuts Park, and instead played all of their home games on the road. These delays resulted in a lawsuit between the city of Hartford and Centerplan, the park's developer. Both sides later agreed to mediation. After the city called an insurance bond with Arch Insurance, the firm replaced Centerplan with Whiting-Turner which resumed construction in October 2016. The new developer completed the ballpark for the team's 2017 home opener on April 13, which they lost to the New Hampshire Fisher Cats, 7-2. The nickname \\"Yard Goats\\" was selected as part of a \\"Name the Team\\" contest which drew over 6,000 submissions. \\"Yard goats\\" is rail-yard slang for the switch engines or terminal tractors that shuttle train cars between different locomotives. The stadium is adjacent to the Hartford rail yards. The logo features a goat chomping on a baseball bat and the team makes heavy use of animal imagery and symbolism. The blue and green colors are a nod to the Hartford Whalers team that played in the National Hockey League from 1979 to 1997. The team stages an annual Whalers Reunion weekend, with special uniforms resembling the hockey club's and the logo has the goat chomping a hockey stick. The logo font replicates that used by the former New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad. Mascots The team has two mascots, a green male goat named Chompers and a blue female goat named Chew Chew. The names were selected as part of a \\"Name the Mascot\\" contest. Chew Chew's name is designed to reflect both the railroad meaning of the nickname (as in choo choo train) and the goat logo, which is chewing on a baseball bat. On April 21, 2016, Hartford Police reported that an individual had tackled Chompers outside the Connecticut Science Center after an event there. The man inside the costume, who was not named, was uninjured. Police are unsure whether it was an intentional assault or a prank that went too far.

In the period between pushing for these reforms and their adoption by the corrupt Constitutional Assembly, a strong opposition composed chiefly of university students formed against this \\"Machadato\\" (Machado + mandato, mandate). The DEU held various protests against Machado's regime and was at the political forefront of the One Hundred Days Government led by Ram√≥n Grau. The group dissolved itself on November 6, 1933.  Background  Student activism flourished in the 1920s. In 1922‚Äì1923, students formed an organization called the Federaci√≥n Estudiantil Universitaria (FEU; University Student Federation) which addressed political as well as scholastic issues and took a stance against American imperialism. After the election of Machado in 1924 some of the gains in student power were reversed, and non-educational student organizations, including the FEU, were banned. The Student Directory formed in this context as an assembly of the leaders of existing athletic and cultural organizations.Aguilar (1972), pp. 73‚Äì78.Marcin Kula, ‚ÄúLos estratos medios de la sociedad en el movimiento revolucionario. La revoluci√≥n de 1933 en Cuba‚Äù; Revista Mexicana de Sociolog√≠a 43(3), July‚ÄìSeptember 1981; JSTOR.  Opposition to Machado  Some of the group's first leaders were expelled from school but new ones arose and the group became a vanguard of opposition to Machado. The assassination of exiled former FEU leader Julio Antonio Mella in 1929 further exacerbated the tension with Machado which arose when he announced the extension of his term.Jules R. Benjamin, \\"The Machadato and Cuban Nationalism, 1928‚Äì1932\\", Hispanic American Historical Review 55(1), February 1975. The student manifesto called Machado a \\"human beast, a Nero or Caligula.\\" Rafael Trejo Gonz√°lez became a martyr of the student movement. Confrontations between government and opposition became violent in 1930. The DEU planned to disrupt the opening ceremony at the University but were thwarted by a police informant in their ranks who gave away the plan. On September 30, 1930, the scheduled beginning of classes, police were guarding the university, and the students began a march outside. Some arrests and injuries occurred, and the student Rafael Trejo Gonz√°lez (es) died in the hospital from his injuries.Aguilar (1972), pp. 101‚Äì107. The protest and the death of Trejo brought the students to the forefront of the national political scene. The government accused them of being Communist subversives, which perhaps some of them were, and announced its intention to act against them unhesitatingly. Civil society groups, politicians, editorialists, and others expressed their support for the students. On October 29 the students published a political program calling for transformation of the University of Havana and of Cuban society as a whole. Their demands included an investigation into the September 30 events, the resignation of education secretary Octavio Averhoff y Pla and of University Rector Dr. Ricardo Mart√≠nez Pietro, demilitarization of educational centers, reinstatement of students expelled in 1927, and autonomy for the University. In November all schools were closed, free speech was officially suppressed, and the army patrolled the streets. The government had acquiesced to the request for autonomy at the University and the resignation of Rector Mart√≠nez Pietro. However, after the students further demanded that Machado resign, the government ordered the entire membership of the DEU to be arrested on January 4, 1931. They spent much of their prison time reading and discussing politics; by the time they were released in March, some of the more radical students had formed a splinter group called Ala Izquierda Estudiantil (AIE; Student Left Wing).Aguilar (1972), pp. 116‚Äì117. While the AIE took a left-wing stance, hoping for an alliance with the peasantry and the proletariat, the Student Directory placed less emphasis on class division, focusing on the abuses of Machado and the injustice of American imperialism under the Platt Amendment.Suchlicki (1968), p. 358. The schools remained closed for three years, while the students adapted their tactics, holding surprise protests called t√°nganas. The group also evolved ideologically, influenced by authors such as Jos√© Ingenieros, Jos√© Enrique Rod√≥, Jos√© Vasconcelos, Jos√© Marti, Enrique Jos√© Varona, Giner de los R√≠os, Miguel de Unamuno, and Jos√© Ortega y Gasset. Political events abroad also influenced the group‚Äîespecially the New Deal underway in the United States and the Communist and Fascist movements in Europe, including the Republic ideologies coming to the forefront in Spain.Suchlicki (1968), p. 361.Carrillo (1994), p. 2. \\"Over that period of three years, the leaders of the student organization developed a maturity which transformed them into an elite group with an ideological and political definition totally distinct from that which they had espoused when they had originally entered the struggle.\\"  Revolution of 1933  The struggle against Machado continued, with other groups including the ABC and the Cuban Communist Party also participating in the opposition, and sometimes overlapping with the students if not cooperating with each other. A turning point came in May 1933, when newly arrived American ambassador Sumner Welles was invited to mediate with selected opposition groups and the Machado regime. The Student Directory refused to participate in the American mediation, while the ABC and some smaller groups accepted the invitation.Aguilar (1972), pp. 132‚Äì138. After the Machado government was replaced with an American-backed coalition, including the ABC and headed by Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes y Quesada, on August 12, 1933, Welles expressed his surprise and frustration at the students and workers flooding into the streets as if to take control of the country: \\"They are taking the attitude that a triumphant revolution has placed the Government in power and that they are consequently entitled to dictate the policies of the Government\\".Aguilar (1972), pp. 152‚Äì153. The students promulgated another statement of their platform on August 24, calling for agrarian reform, nationalization of sugar and mining, a national banking system, reform of the foreign debt, and tax reform, as well as abrogation of the Platt Amendment and autonomy for the University of Havana.Suchlicki (1968), p. 361‚Äì362. They envisioned a government selected by the Student Directory and the abolition of all groups implicated in the Machadato. All citizens, including women, would have the right to vote from age 18.Aguilar (1972), p. 157‚Äì158. On September 4, 1933, when lower-ranking officers and enlisted men successfully took over Columbia barracks, the student leaders met with them and together agreed on a plan to form a new government. Together the students and soldiers appointed a governing Pentarchy which included two professors.Suchlicki (1968), pp. 364‚Äì368. ‚ÄúThe government‚Äôs inner conflict contributed to its instability. A faction led by student leaders and Interior Minister Antonio Guiteras advocated a continuation of the program of social reform. Strongly nationalistic and sincerely motivated, Guiteras initiated much of the regime‚Äôs legislation, and many considered him the real brains behind Grau. Another faction controlled by Batista and the army wanted a conservative program which would bring about United States recognition. Grau seemed to have been caught in the middle of these two tendencies. On November 6 the Directorio, feeling that its mandate had expired, declared itself dissolved, announcing, however, that its members would continue to support President Grau.‚ÄùAguilar (1972), p. 161. ‚ÄúAs soon as they learned of the revolt, several leaders of the Student Directory rushed to the Columbia barracks. The first to arrive were Jos√© Leyva, Ramiro Valdes Dauss√°, Juan Ant√≥nio Rubio Padilla, Carlos Pr√≠o Socarr√°s, Rub√©n de Le√≥n, and Justo Carrillo. They joined the sergeants and talked them into widening the movement. Because of their action, a military rebellion inside the army was transformed into a general movement against the government of C√©spedes and everything it represented. In the words of Enrique Fern√°ndez: ‚ÄòThey transformed an insubordination into a revolution.‚Äô They were also accepting the historical responsibility of backing open intervention of the army in a political struggle.‚Äù After five days the Pentarchy gave way to the leadership of one of its members, Professor Ram√≥n Grau San Mart√≠n. The Directory had to intervene to stop the selection of Gustavo Cuervo Rubio, an ally of conservative Mario Garc√≠a Menocal. They unilaterally selected Grau and his cabinet, which prominently included Dr. Antonio Guiteras Holmes.Aguilar (1972), pp. 169‚Äì170. ‚ÄúThe next day one of the students, Rubio Padilla, learned accidentally that the Pentarchs planned to meet in the Presidential Palace to choose Gustavo Cuervo Rubio as president. Cuervo Rubio was a respected physician considered by many to be nonpolitical, but some members of the Student Directory knew of his close relations with Menocal. Another urgent meeting was convened, and while the members of the Pentarchy were deliberating on the third floor of the Presidential Palace, the Student Directory met in a turbulent assembly on the second floor. The Directory now had more than thirty members, since it had decided to let all those who had ever been members of the body participate in the sessions. A commission composed of Rub√©n de Le√≥n, Rubio Padilla, and Carlos Pr√≠o went up to inform the Pentarchs that they were no longer Pentarchs and did not have the right to select the president. The Student Directory, on its own authority, appointed Ram√≥n Grau San Mart√≠n as the head of the revolutionary government.‚Äù The \\"One Hundred Days Government\\" which followed made numerous reformist decrees. The United States refused to recognize the legitimacy of this government. Internally, the ideological differences between the students and the military soon became apparent. The discovery of a plot by Batista to seize power led to a failed plan to assassinate him on November 3, forcing the Student Directory to confront the issue of whether they could continue to work with Batista. Unable to reach a decision, the Directory dissolved itself on November 6, 1933.Aguilar (1972), pp. 191‚Äì192. In January, the military, under the leadership of Fulgencio Batista, deposed Grau and installed a new government which the United States recognized immediately. Prominent members Prominent members of the Student Directory included: Carlos Prio Socarras, Pablo de la Torriente Brau, Salvador Vilaseca Forn√©, Jos√© Lezama Lima, Justo Carrillo, Guillermo Barrientos Schweyer, Pepel√≠n Leyva, Juan Marinello, Aureliano Sanchez Arango, Raul Roa Garcia, Antonio D√≠az Baldaqu√≠n, Eduardo Chibas, and Rafael Trejo Gonzalez. These students were young and mostly middle-class.Suchlicki (1968), pp. 360‚Äì361. \\"The generation of 1930 was generally very young. Most of the student leaders were in their early twenties. A majority came from middle-class backgrounds. Some like Eduardo Chib√°s, however, were from wealthy families, while others like S√°nchez Arango came from poorer homes. Several were descendants of veterans of the War of Independence. Their ancestors‚Äô participation in public affairs seemed to have been an inspiration for their own active political roles. Many came from areas outside the capital city. Living apart from families and parental discipline, and exposed to the loneliness of a new environment, these students gravitated toward the campus and were perhaps more prone to political involvement than the average city student\\". They became known as the \\"Generation of 1930\\" and gained respect as idealistic reformers.Suchlicki (1968), pp. 356‚Äì357. \\"Trejo's death was the turning point in the struggle against the regime. After September, 1930, the Cubans viewed the courageous student generation that battled Machado's police with admiration and respect. For some 'the generation of 1930,' as these students were later known in Cuban history, seemed irresponsible and undisciplined, while for others it became the best exponent of disinterested idealism. Embattled by the first shock waves of the world depression and oppressed by an increasingly despotic dictator, many Cubans, especially among the less privileged sectors of society, turned in hope and despair toward these youngsters. They deposited their faith in a generation that although inexperienced and immature, seemed incorruptible and willing to bring morality to Cuba‚Äôs public life\\".

It is a form of consumption that is compatible with the safeguard of the environment for the present and for the next generations. It is a concept which ascribes to consumers responsibility or co-responsibility for addressing environmental problems through adoption of environmentally friendly behaviors, such as the use of organic products, clean and renewable energy and the research of goods produced by companies with zero, or almost zero, impact (zero waste, zero-emissions vehicle, zero-energy building, etc.).J. Connoly, A. Prothero, 2008, Green consumption: life- politics, risk and contradictions, Journal of consumer culture, vol. 8, pp. 117-145 In Western societies, during the 1960s and the early 1970s, the necessity to protect the environment and people's health from the effects caused by industrial pollutants and by continuous economic and population growth has developed this new idea of consumption. In the 1980s, the first American \\"green\\" brands began to appear and exploded on the American market. During the 1990s, green products had a slow mild growth, remaining a niche phenomenon. American interest in green products started to increase again in the early 2000s with greater speed and, despite the latest recession, have continued to grow.R.Elliott, 2013, The taste for green:the possibilities and dynamics of status differentiation through \\"green\\" consumption, Sci Verse ScienceDirect, ELSEVIER, vol. 41, pp. 294-322  Origin and development  The origin of the necessity to behave in an environmental-friendly way goes back to the 1960s and '70s. In particular, after the oil crisis of 1973, Western countries start to think about the use of renewable energy as an alternative to fossil fuels. Nowadays green consumption is considered a basic point of environmental reform and it is also guaranteed by supra-national organizations like the European Union. Some sociologists argue that after the increasing globalization, people feel more interconnected with other people and the environment, so there has been increasing awareness of global environmental problems, especially in western countries. The main forums in which the issue has been discussed, and provided guidelines to orient national governments are: Stockholm 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment; IUCN 1980 World Conservation Strategy; World Commission on Environment and Development in 1983 and 1987 Brundtland Report; Italy 1993 National Plan for Sustainable Development; Aalborg 1994, 1st European Conference on Sustainable Cities; Lisbon 1996, 2nd European Conference on Sustainable Cities; Hannover 2000, 3rd Conference on Sustainable Cities; European Union in 2001, VI Environmental Action Plan 2002/2010; Aalborg +10 and the Aalborg Commitments in 2004.  Pro-environmental behavior  Green consumer behavior is a form of pro- environmental behavior, which can be defined as a form of consumption that harms the environment as little as possible, or even benefits the environment.L. Steg, C.

Sarigollu, 2016, Exploring pro-environmental behaviors of consumers: An analysis of contextual factors, attitude, and behaviors, Journal of business research, vol. 69, no. 10, pp. 3971-3980 In sum, it is through attitude, that subjectively perceived contextual factors such as, for example, the extent to which consumers perceive having more or less time, money and power available, modulate pro- environmental behavior, in general, and green consumption, in particular.  Green consumer behavior  We can define green consumer behavior by the following characteristics: * \\"purchase choice, product use and post-use, household management, collective, and consumer activism behaviors, reflecting some degree of environmental- related motivation\\";K. Peattie, 2010, Green consumption: behavior and norms, vol. 35, pp. 195-228 * \\"purchase and use of products with lower environmental impacts, such as biodegradable products, recycled or reduced packaging, and low energy usage\\";D.

Gender and identity salience effects on sustainable consumption, International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 540-549 * use of organic product, made with processes that provide energy saving, then by the action of recycling, in fact a green consumer is \\"one who purchase products and services perceived to have a positive (or less negative) influence on the environment [‚Ä¶]\\"K. Haws, R. Walker Naylor, K. Page Winterich, 2013, Seeing the world through GREEN- tinted Glasses: Green Consumption Values and Responses to Environmentally Friendly Products, Journal of Consumer Psychology We can find a green consumer behavior when an individual acts ethically, motivated not only by his/her personal needs, but also by the respect and preservation of the welfare of entire society, because a green consumer takes into account the environmental consequences (costs and benefits) of his/her private consumption. Green consumers are expected to be more conscientious in their use of assets, for example by using their goods without wasting resources. However the Eurobarometer's survey of consumers‚Äô behavior (2013) showed that consumers seem not to be fully conscious of the importance to adopt a set of new behaviors, that are more environmental-friendly. In this report it is possible to find that even though a very high proportion of citizens buy green products (80%), more than a half are classified as occasional maintenance (54%), and only a quarter are regular buyer of green products (26%). This fact implies that most of people do not behave like green consumer continuously, probably because of a lot of social and economic constraints, such as the fact that green products are much more expensive than non-green ones, and also because it is not always so easy to find organic and biological goods for each category, and because the green-retailers are not so widespread. Some researchers find that personal values are influential determinants of consumption and that pro-environmental behavior might serve as a signal of personality dimension. Considering the time-horizon in the acquisition of green behavior, we can distinguish two types of consumers: # prevention-type consumers, that feel a moral duty towards a greener lifestyle # promotion- type, that are more focused on their aspirations and their dreams and don't strongly feel the pressure to quickly adjust their behavior in the direction of becoming more environmental-friendly.G. Bertoli, M. Bonera, A. Codini, E. Corvi, G. Miniero, 2014, Being green: from attitude to actual consumption, International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 521-528 Another research find the effect of gender and social identity on green consumption: \\"female declared higher levels of sustainable consumption compared with male participants; however when social identity is salient, male increased their sustainable consumption intentions to the same level as female.D. C. Pinto, M. M. Herter, P. Rossi, A. Borges, 2014, Going green for self or for others? Gender and identity salience effects on sustainable consumption, International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 540-549 In this research are identified two kind of people, that have more: # self-transcendent values, like woman, that are more willing to engage in sustainable consumption # self- enhanced values, like men, that are less interested in green behavior The fact is that sustainable consumption is, for men, a way to reinforce their social image, showing to others that they care about environment, instead for women is intrinsically important. The evidence is that green consumers are mainly female, aged between 30 and 44 years old, well educated, in a household with a high annual income.D. C. Pinto, M. M. Herter, P. Rossi, A. Borges, 2014, Going green for self or for others? Gender and identity salience effects on sustainable consumption, International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 540-549  Principal areas of developed green consumption   Green energy  Green energy includes natural energetic processes that can be harnessed with little pollution.  Green food  In the food area, there is a recent growing of demand for less environmentally-damaging food production, that leads people to buy more organic and local food. Organic food is produced through agriculture which does not use artificial chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and animals reared in more natural conditions, without the routine use of drugs, antibiotics and wormers common in intensive livestock farming. Consumers can also choose to buy local food in order to reduce the social and environmental impacts of \\"food miles\\" ‚Äì the distance food travels between being produced and being consumed. This behavior can create a new sense of connection with the land, through a concern for the authenticity and provenience of the food eaten, operating a social as much as a technological innovation.G. Seyfang, 2007, Growing sustainable consumption communities, The case of local organic food networks, International Journal of Sociology and social policy, vol. 27, pp. 120-134 In addition, taste, health and safety concerns can be other reasons behind this consumption practices.  Green fashion  \\"Ethical clothing refers to clothing that takes into consideration the impact of production and trade on the environment and on the people behind the clothes we wear. Eco clothing refers to all clothing that has been manufactured using environmentally friendly processes. It includes organic textiles and sustainable materials such as hemp and non-textiles such as bamboo or recycled plastic bottles. It also includes recycled products (clothes made from recycled clothing including vintage, textile and other materials and can also be termed re-used) and is not necessarily made from organic fibers. Organic clothing means clothes that have been made with a minimum use of chemicals and with minimum damage to the environment and fair- trade is intended to achieve better prices, decent working conditions, local sustainability and fair terms for farmers and workers in the developing world\\".M.C Cervellon, H.

An exploratory study of national differences in consumers concern for eco- fashion, Paper presented at 9th International Marketing Trends Conference, Venice, Italy The three main reasons that would motivate the purchase of organic cloths are: * Environmental-friendly protection; * Health impact; * Ethical concerns. Another important question is related to the textile and clothing industry that generates much pollution and consumes a large amount of resources. Improper uses and disposal of clothing products make the problems much more severe. Consumers are concerned about these (environmental) issues, and are best motivated to change their behaviors in a philanthropic or environmental- friendly actions that adapt with their financial and sustainability interests. An intuitive and sustainable strategy is the reusing cloths. Textile recycling is a method of reprocessing used clothing, fibrous material and clothing scraps from the manufacturing process. This can reduce manufacturing pollution and resource consumption.Z. H. Hu, Q. Li, X. J. Chen, Y. F. Wang, 2014, Sustainable Rent-Based Closed-Loop Supply Chain for Fashion Products, Sustainability, vol. 6, pp. 7063-7088 The world is facing one of the worst economic crises ever, which affects all industries, including fashion and luxury.

An exploratory study of national differences in consumers concern for eco- fashion, Paper presented at 9th International Marketing Trends Conference, Venice, Italy Consumers pay attention to the origin and the materials of the clothes they buy and the fact that they are not harmful to the environment.Cotton incorporated: http://www.cottoninc.com/corporate/Market- Data/SupplyChainInsights/consumer-perspectives-on-green-apparel/ Also, the issue of trust arises and a label certifying the organic origin is strongly required. But consumers often have a lack of information of green fashion or maybe they are unaware of the existence of green fashion alternatives to traditional adult fashion. Thus, there is a need to create awareness and inform better the consumers on the nature of organic fashion.

History  The David Taylor House, built in the early 1850s by Sheboygan County Judge David Taylor, a once prominent citizen in the early years of Sheboygan. The house became county property around 1900 and was later used for the Sheboygan County Sheriff's Office and county jail from 1915 to 1936, when the Sheboygan County Courthouse was completed. The house was then used by the caretaker of Taylor Park for many years and was leased to the Sheboygan County Historical Society in 1949. The road leading to the park known as Taylor Drive eventually became a west-side local beltline road for the city. The Sheboygan County Historical Museum was originally on the first floor of the David Taylor House. In the early 1970s, the museum expanded to the entire building. The Taylor House served as the main museum building until the new museum was opened in 1997 across the grounds.

Being both a victim and wager of cyberwarfare, Iran is considered an emerging military power in the field. Since November 2010, an organization called \\"The Cyber Defense Command\\" (; Gharargah-e Defa-e Saiberi) has been operating in Iran under the supervision of the country's \\"Passive Civil Defense Organization\\" (; Sazeman-e Padafand-e Gheyr-e Amel) which is itself a subdivision of the Joint Staff of Iranian Armed Forces. According to a 2014 report by Institute for National Security Studies, Iran is \\"one of the most active players in the international cyber arena\\". In 2013, a Revolutionary Guards general stated that Iran has \\"the 4th biggest cyber power among the world's cyber armies.\\"  Attacks against Iran  In June 2010, Iran was the victim of a cyber-attack when its nuclear facility in Natanz was infiltrated by the cyber-worm 'Stuxnet'. Reportedly a combined effort by the United States and Israel, Stuxnet destroyed perhaps over 1,000 nuclear centrifuges and, according to a Business Insider article, \\"[set] Tehran's atomic programme back by at least two years.\\" The worm spread beyond the plant to allegedly infect over 60,000 computers, but the government of Iran indicates it caused no significant damage. Iran crowdsourced solutions to the worm and is purportedly now better positioned in terms of cyber warfare technology. No government has claimed responsibility for the worm.  Events  * In October 2013, media reported Mojtaba Ahmadi, who served as commander of the \\"Cyber War Headquarters\\" was found dead wounded by bullets in Karaj. * November 2018: The Iranian telecommunication minister Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi accuses Israel of a failed cyberattack on its telecommunications infrastructure, and vows to respond with legal action.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-israel- cyber/iran-accuses-israel-of-failed-cyber-attack- idUSKCN1NA1LJhttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/iran-accuses-israel- of-failed-cyber-attack-10900158  Attacks by Iran  The Iranian government has been accused by western analysts of its own cyber-attacks against the United States, Israel and Persian Gulf Arab countries, but deny this, including specific allegations of 2012 involvement in hacking into American banks. The conflict between Iran and the United States has been called \\"history's first known cyber-war\\" by Michael Joseph Gross mid-2013.\\"Silent War\\" July 2013 Vanity Fair  Events  * August 2014: An IDF official told press in that Iran has launched numerous significant attacks against Israel's Internet infrastructure. * 31 March 2015: Iranian hackers, possibly Iranian Cyber Army pushed a massive power outage for 12 hours in 44 of 81 provinces of Turkey, holding 40 million people. Istanbul and Ankara were among the places suffering blackout. * June 2017: The Daily Telegraph reported that intelligence officials concluded that Iran was responsible for a cyberattack on the British Parliament lasting 12 hours that compromised around 90 email accounts of MPs. The motive for the attack is unknown but experts suggested that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps could be using cyberwarfare to undermine the Iran nuclear deal.  Suspended Iranian accounts  On May 5, 2020, Reuters reported, quoting a monthly Facebook report, that Iranian state- run media had targeted hundreds of fake social media accounts to covertly spread pro-Iranian messaging, online since at least 2011, for secretly broadcasting online promotional messages in favor of Iran in order targeting voters in countries including Britain and the United States. Accounts suspended for so-called ‚Äúcoordinated inauthentic behavior\\", which removed eight networks in recent weeks, including one with links to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting.

From 1787 to 1789 he was Minister plenipotentiary of the Austrian Netherlands, ruling on behalf of Emperor Joseph II. Life Ferdinand was born in Vienna on 12 January 1749, a member of the noble family of Trauttsmandorff. He studied at the University of Vienna and served in the Reichskammergericht in Wetzlar. In 1772, he married Marie Caroline von Colloredo (1752‚Äì1832). At his brother's death in 1774, he became the head of the family, and count and prince of Trauttmansdorff.Joseph Lef√®vre, \\"Trauttmansdorff, Ferdinand, graaf en prins van\\", Nationaal Biografisch Woordenboek, vol. 4 (Brussels, 1970), 837-842. In 1780, he was appointed Austrian minister in Regensburg, and in 1785 imperial ambassador to the Archbishop-Elector of Mainz. In 1787, he was appointed the emperor's minister plenipotentiary in the Austrian Netherlands, effectively head of the government. He arrived in Brussels in October 1787. His brief was to push through the innovations that Joseph II had determined on and that the previous minister plenipotentiary, Ludovico, Count di Belgiojoso, had been forced to dial back. In his zeal to execute imperial policy, Trauttmansdorff carried out a government coup on 18 June 1789, rescinding the ancient privileges of the county of Hainaut, decreeing the abolition of the Council of Brabant, and arbitrarily imprisoning many of the opponents of government policy. His dictatorial behaviour precipitated the Brabant Revolution. Count Richard d'Alton, General Commander of Imperial Forces in Austrian Netherlands was against such drastic reforms and advised against them. In November, he began to offer concessions and recognise ancient liberties, but too late to stem revolutionary rejection of Austrian authority.Henri Pirenne, \\"Trauttmansdorff (Ferdinand, comte puis prince de)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 25 (Brussels, 1932), 547-552. On 14 December 1789, Trauttmansdorff fled Brussels for Luxembourg. His secret correspondence with Joseph II while minister plenipotentiary was published in 1902.H. Schlitter, Geheime Correspondenz Jozefs II. mit seinem Minister Ferdinand Grafen Trauttmansdorff (Vienna, 1902). He re-entered imperial service in 1793, being appointed to the Chancery for the Netherlands in Vienna.

Biography His father, Jorge, was a native of Scotland and served as the consul in Santiago. His mother, Carmen, was the daughter of independence leader Antonio Jos√© de Irisarri and the sister of poet Herm√≥genes Irisarri. His family wanted him to be a lawyer. With his own money, he purchased brushes and paints, but they were thrown away. He continued to insist so vehemently that, in 1849, his family gave in and allowed him to study at the new \\"Academia de Pintura\\" founded by President Manuel Bulnes. His first teacher there was the Director, an Italian-born artist named Alejandro Ciccarelli, who worked to instil the Academic style in his students.Brief biography @ Artistas Pl√°sticos Chilenos. Smith wanted to paint landscapes instead of mythological subjects, but Ciccarelli was adamant in his opposition. In 1851, thoroughly frustrated, Smith left the school to paint on his own. Eusebio Lillo, author of the Chilean National Anthem A year later, unsuccessful, he enlisted in a squadron of mounted grenadiers. He was stationed in Chill√°n, where he got married and abandoned his military career at the end of his five-year enlistment. On his return to Santiago, he became an employee of a savings bank managed by a former classmate of his, , who would later become a well-known diplomat. After only a year, he quit and became an illustrator for the political daily El Correo Literario, which was critical of the Conservative Republic. Although handicapped by old, malfunctioning equipment and a dearth of decent supplies, he created a huge number of portrait caricatures of notable people (including his old nemesis, Ciccarelli), with humorous captions or poems by . As might be expected, there was much official opposition. President Manuel Montt called on them to stop publishing \\"esos monos groseros\\" (those crude monkeys). After less than a year of operation, they had to close up shop, at least temporarily. Time abroad Self-portrait The failure of the Revolution of 1859 forced him to emigrate. He decided to go to France and, after a short time, became reasonably successful. However, the Bohemian lifestyle he had adopted caused him to squander his money, so he had to go to the United States to seek financial assistance from his grandfather, Antonio Jos√©, who at that time was a diplomat in New York. He then went to Italy, where he spent a year working with the landscape painter Carlo Marco. After that, he decided to return to Chile, despite the dangers involved in sea travel during the Chincha Islands War. In 1866, following a difficult six-month voyage, he landed at San Antonio and joined a group of firefighters from Santiago, although he did not remain with them for long. Serious cultural reforms were sweeping the country, but he was amazed to see how little had changed at the Academy. That is, Ciccarelli was still in charge, so Smith established his own teaching workshop. In 1869, Ciccarelli was replaced by , a German painter who was more amenable to Smith, and they began sharing students. Some of his best-known students include Alfredo Valenzuela Puelma, Pedro Lira, Alberto Orrego Luco, Onofre Jarpa and Cosme San Mart√≠n.

It was designed by A & K Henderson and built from 1929 to 1930 by George Alexander Stronach. It is also known as National Bank of Australasia. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This building, constructed in 1929-30, replaced an earlier bank which had erected in 1891 for the Royal Bank of Queensland. In 1917 the Royal Bank of Queensland merged with another Queensland bank, the Bank of North Queensland to form the Bank of Queensland. In 1922, the Bank of Queensland was absorbed by the National Bank of Australasia and several years later decided to build a new bank on the site. Designed by Melbourne architects A & K Henderson with assistance from local firm of Atkinson, Powell & Conrad, the contractor was G A Stronach, with the technical advice of Thomas Walker Pearce. It was an example of the pervasive fashion for the neo-classical style in commercial and civic buildings, of similar scale and materials during the period. The building was opened on 6 May 1930 and its lavish fittings and imposing style attracted favourable comment. Prominent features of the building included the large bronze doors in the Queen Street entrance, separate lifts for tenants, and a special women's banking section fitted with lounge, retiring room, writing facilities and telephone. Over the years various professional tenants have occupied the upper floors - solicitors, doctors, accountants, architects, and optometrists. The new building, like its predecessor, served as the head office of the National Bank of Australasia in Queensland until 1948 when it absorbed the last of the distinctively Queensland banks of the nineteenth century, the Queensland National Bank. The new head office was set up in the former Queensland National Bank building on the corner of Queen and Creek Streets. In 1983 the National Bank of Australasia merged with the Commercial Banking Corporation to form the National Australia Bank. The bank no longer owns the building. It was sold in 2012 for $29.5 million. However, the bank continue to operate a safety deposit facility in the building's basement. Country Road operate a retail store from the ground floor while small tenants occupy the upper floors.  Description  Lower facade, 2015 Bank signage, 2015 The National Australia Bank Central Branch, located at 180 Queen Street, is a seven storey structure with a steel frame and reinforced concrete floors and roof. The external walls are brick with sandstone facing and a granite plinth on the front facade. The sandstone is from Yangan, Queensland and the granite from Uralla, New South Wales. The main facade, in the Classical Revival style, is divided into five vertical bays. The three central bays are distinguished by flanking giant order pilasters which extend from above the ground floor level to the cornice line below the parapet. The openings on the upper level have semicircular arches. The three central openings have individual balconies with balustrading and a projecting cornice/balustrade that returns to the flanking side bays. These are plainer with narrower openings. The original glazing on the building has been replaced by aluminium framed glazing to a similar pattern. At the ground floor level the building has four engaged Doric columns above the granite plinth and flanking the three entrance doorways. Over these is an entablature that has balustraded balconies to the first floor level. The ground floor contains the main banking chamber with a mezzanine level, partly renovated. Much of the plaster detailing in the chamber remains. The vestibule and adjoining lift lobby have finely figured marble linings. The second and third floors retain the original office layout and finishes, but other levels have been modified to accommodate larger tenancies. The relatively austere basement contains carefully detailed security grilles and a strong room. The south-western upper wall has bank signage.  Heritage listing  National Australia Bank was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The National Australia Bank is a fine example of a 1920s bank with Classical elements reflecting the solidity of a financial institution. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building is significant for its contribution to the streetscape in terms of style, scale, and texture, in conjunction with the adjoining Finney Isles & Co Building.

He was a teacher at Oisterwijk and later Nijmegen and then Amsterdam where he taught at the new school association. In 1902, he went to the Swedish village N√§√§s for a course. There he saw the game ring boll played. This game was played with mixed gender teams. The ball had to be thrown through a ring on a three-meter high pole. The field was divided into three sections, where players were allowed to come out. At home in Amsterdam, Broekhuysen showed his students a similar game. The rules have been simplified and the ring was replaced by a basket. The first game was played on a vacant lot at the Jan Luykenstraat. When they were looking, at the Amsterdam Association for Physical Education in a game where both boys and girls could join, he brought his version forward. On June 2, 1903, the Dutch Korfball Association was founded, where Broekhuysen President was. Korfball immediately became a popular sport, but also because of the mixed play that was considered immoral, controversial. A newspaper even wrote: \\"Korfball is a monster, that extends its claws to all sides.\\" Later he moved to Baarn he head of the New Baarnsche School has been. Korfball during the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp was a demonstration sport with the help of Broekhuysen. In 1933, he was co- founder of the International Federation of Korfball, the international Korfball federation. He remained until 1934 president of the Dutch league and was then honorary chairman. In 1958 he died at the age of 81 and was buried in Baarn.

History Although no precise date has been recorded for the foundation of the club, Gaelic games have been played in the parish since at least the nineteenth century. One of the earliest written accounts of a Scotstown club appearing in a January 1890 edition of The People's Advocate newspaper and a game against neighbours Ballinode. Various clubs came and went in the parish over the first half of the twentieth century with Scotstown winning a Monaghan Junior Football League title in 1933, Tydavnet won a Monaghan Junior Championship in 1935, and Knockatallon secured a Monaghan Junior Football League in 1944. The parish was represented intermittently up until the late 1950s by these three clubs, with all three struggling in the face of emigration and unemployment. The club finally made the breakthrough at Senior level in the county after Tydavnet and Scotstown amalgamated before going on to win the Monaghan Senior Football Championship for the first time in 1960. The Knockatallon club threw their lot in with their parish neighbours shortly afterwards, and this united Tydavnet Parish club went on to unprecedented success in Monaghan and Ulster over the coming decades. The most successful period in the history of the club was during the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the club won three Ulster Senior Club Football Championships in a row. They reached the Senior All-Ireland club final in 1979, losing to Nemo Rangers. A fourth Senior Ulster club title was secured in 1989 against Coalisland Na Fianna. The club won their fourteenth Monaghan Senior Football title in 1993, but a barren period followed over the next two decades. The measure of success during that period was that the club were able to preserve their Senior status throughout. The drought was finally ended with another Senior Championship win in 2013, followed by more success in 2015 and 2016. The club have a long tradition of producing administrators including Se√°n McCague, President of the Gaelic Athletic Association from 2000‚Äì2003, and the former Director General of the GAA, Paraic Duffy. Scotstown GAA play their home fixtures at P√°irc Mhuire/Saint Mary's Park, half a mile to the north-east of the village of Scotstown. Facilities at the ground include dressing rooms, meeting room, sports complex, covered stand, social club and a handball alley. The club training grounds are located at Kilmore East, between the villages of Scotstown and Ballinode. Facilities at the training grounds include dressing rooms, a full-sized Prunty pitch, two smaller training pitches and a perimeter walking/running track.

Despite having an implantable cardioverter- defibrillator implanted into his chest, Toledo refused to clear Moss to play but offered to allow him to remain at the school on an athletic scholarship. As a result, Moss transferred to Indian Hills Community College in Iowa where he played one season before joining his former high school coach Nate Oats at Buffalo for his sophomore season.

Javier visiting the construction works at Real Club de Golf El Prat, Barcelona in 1953  Sports career  Javier was the older child of Luis Arana Urig√ºen and Lola Ybarra's three sons. He was introduced to sports at a young age by his father, a leading sportsman. Luis was a successful businessman who was deeply involved with the introduction of sports to Bilbao at the beginning of the 20th century, practising football, athletics, sailing and golf. Javier himself started playing golf at the age of 10 years, in the 11-hole course of the Real Sociedad de Golf de Neguri, which was a mere 500 meters from his summer home in Las Arenas, Guecho. During his youth, he split his time between golf and sailing, where he became an expert sailor representing Spain at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympic Games in the 6 metre class. However, he found greater success in golf and gradually abandoned sailing at the beginning of the 1930s. His first relevant golfing victory took place in 1926, when he won the first of his five Vizcaya Championships (1926, 1929, 1931, 1933 y 1935). Since then, and until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil war in 1936, Javier together with his brother Luis Ignacio, became the leading Spanish amateur golfer, as well as one of the best players in Continental Europe. In Spain, Javier was a three-time winner of the International Spanish Amateur Championships (1928, 1933, 1934) and a four-time winner of the Copa Nacional Puerta de Hierro (1928, 1929, 1930 y 1934). In the international arena, he won the Southwest France Championship (1933), the French International Amateur Championship (1934) and the Belgian International Amateur Championship (1935). He was also runner-up to the French International Amateur Championship (1935) and the Swiss International Amateur Championship (1935) and played in the Open Championship in 1934 played in Royal St. Georges, where he was unable to qualify for the final rounds after two rounds of 78 and 77 strokes. Javier also played a critical role representing Spain in its annual matches against France and in the Spanish national team's maiden European tour of 1935, visiting the France, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. The Spanish war brought national golf competitions to a halt until the autumn of 1939, interrupting a promising career in the international amateur scene. Following the war hiatus, Javier gradually abandoned competitive golf, although he still had time to win his last Copa Nacional Puerta de Hierro (1939) and the Portuguese International Amateur Championship (1940). His farewell to competiiton happened after a 1940 tour of Argentina, where he played the Amateur Championship, the Argentina Open and the Abierto del Centro before returning to Spain in January 1941.  Professional career  Although the Civil War brought his golfing career to a halt, it also steered Javier into the design of golf courses, for which he is widely known. He was a proficient greenkeeper and the Royal Spanish Golf Federation chose him to lead the reconstruction of golf courses that had been devastated by war. Although he started working in 1940 in Club de Campo, it was the arrival in Madrid in 1946 of English golf course architect Tom Simpson, which ignited Javier's professional career. Simpson had been hired by the neighboring Real Club Puerta de Hierro for the reconstruction of its 1914 Harry Colt design, which had also been destroyed by the Ciudad Universitaria battlefront. Both designers got along well and set-up a partnership under the name Simpson & Arana with the goal of initiating reconstruction work at a national scale. Thus started an intense relationship that would result in the remodelling of Lasarte (1946), Pedre√±a (1946), Sant Cugat (1946), Terramar (1947) M√°laga (1949) and Pedralbes (1949). The main project of this time was the construction of the first 9 holes of the Real Club de Golf Cerda√±a, in Puigcerd√°, Javier's first solo design. Simpson's influence over Javier was very relevant. He took him under his patronage and guided his learning under the principles of the strategic school of design. This current had been very successful in Europe in the 1920s and its main advocates, aside from Simpson, were Harry Colt and Alister Mackenzie. Its fundamental principle was that the layout of obstacles in golf courses should be done in a manner that would require intelligence and not only skill to avoid them, adding an additional dimension to the historically dull layouts of the so-called \\"dark ages\\" of golf design. Although Arana gradually evolved into a style of his own, the strategic principles always remained a key element of his designs: greens of large size, oriented at a diagonal to the line of play, few bunkers but strategically placed and constant changes in the direction of holes. Other personal treats were his ability to adapt the routing of his golf courses to the available land, always perfectly integrated with the natural surrounds and that the 17th hole should always be a par 3. Following Simpson's departure for England in 1948, Arana pursued the rest of his career on his own, designing golf Reina Cristina (Algeciras) in 1951, El Prat (1955), Club de Campo Black Course (1956), Guadalmina Sur (1959), Real Sociedad de Golf de Neguri (1961), R√≠o Real (1965), Ulzama (1966), RACE (1967), El Saler (1968), Ifach (1974) and Aloha (1975). Arana's body of work is not very extense: only ten 18 hole courses in thirty years of professional activity. Unfortunately, his best years happened at a time where Spain lacked the money and required infrastructure to provide adequate watering supply to most of his projects. Anyhow, the exceptional quality of his designs makes up for the small number. Arana is considered the best golf course designer that Continental Europe has ever produced: his designs of El Saler, El Prat and Club de Campo have been regularly ranked as top golf courses in Continental Europe, hosting over 40 professional tour events, the 1965 Canada Cup and over 50 top-level amateur tournaments. Coupled with his design career, Arana performed a very important function in the area of greenkeeping and for many years was the main advocate for proper maintenance as a key element to foster the growth of golf and golfers' enjoyment. The opening of El Prat and Club de Campo in the 1950s were a turning point in Spanish golf which evolved from sand greens to courses akin to those found in the British Isles, setting the foundations for various generations of golf players that have positioned Spanish golf at the privileged position it enjoys today.

After being declared redundant by the Church of England the building is now used by the Bethel United Church of Jesus Christ Apostolic. Organ The church contained an organ by William Hill dating from 1846. It was moved here from St Peter's Church, Handsworth around 1976. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. When the church was closed by the Church of England the organ was removed and was destined for St Mary the Virgin‚Äôs Church, Little Houghton, Northamptonshire.

He also had a deep passion for Africa and worked in Zambia and Botswana in the early years of their independence. Early life Robert Oakeshott, together with his twin brother Evelyn, was born in 1933 in Winchester, Hampshire, the son of Walter Oakeshott and Noel Oakeshott. His father was headmaster of Winchester College, his mother an expert on Greek antiquities. Robert attended Tonbridge School and completed his studies at Balliol College, Oxford, where he studied classics and political economy. His early life was marked by two overseas adventures. After leaving school he was conscripted into the National Service and posted to the British forces fighting an anticolonial rebellion in Malaya. Oakeshott became, very briefly, a cavalry officer in charge of armoured cars. During his Oxford years, in 1956, an anti-Soviet uprising broke out in Hungary. Oakeshott and a fellow student made a goodwill visit to Budapest, taking a consignment of medical supplies. Afterwards, he and group at Balliol raised substantial funds for refugee relief. Fifty years later the Hungarian government made him a Hero of the Revolution. After completing Oxford in 1957, Oakeshott signed on with the Sunderland Echo and found a lifelong vocation for journalism. He soon moved up to the Financial Times, where he discovered the true workings of market capitalism. Once, he recounted later, he was sent on assignment to South Africa and was granted a secret meeting with Nelson Mandela. In 1963 he became the FT's Paris correspondent. A year later, he abandoned his familiar world and sought out newly independent Africa. Overseas work Oakeshott moved to Northern Rhodesia just before its independence as Zambia and began work as a government economist in Lusaka. He participated in two landmark events: the publication of the Transitional Development Plan and the takeover of the country's mineral rights from the British South Africa Company, a holdover from the colonial era. In the struggle between African and colonial interests, he always took the African point of view, often tenaciously. Angry white Rhodesians once threw him off a train during a drunken quarrel about race; he was bloodied but mostly uninjured. At the beginning of 1966, Jo Grimond, an old friend and then leader of the UK Liberal Party, persuaded Oakeshott to fly back to England to stand in the general election for the Liberals in Darlington. His election manifesto called both for the UK's accession to the European Common Market and for effective measures against the [white-supremacist] \\"rebellion in Southern Rhodesia\\". It proved to be a valiant but sacrificial campaign, as the Labour Party candidate won handily, and Oakeshott returned to Zambia. Pursuing an invitation, he visited Swaneng Hill School, a pioneering experiment in self-help education in Serowe, Bechuanaland, an impoverished British protectorate nearing its independence as Botswana. Although he travelled there as a journalist, he was immediately moved by what he saw and asked the school's founder, Patrick van Rensburg, if he could work there. In November 1966 he joined the staff as a teacher, planner, and author of a textbook in Development Studies, an attempt to explain economics from the point of view of aspiring third-world readers. In mid-1967 he became the first manager of the Serowe Farmer's Brigade, a vocational training project that was part of the broader group of Serowe Brigades. A year later he was appointed the founding principal of a sister secondary school, Shashe River School, to be built in Tonota, Botswana. Shashe River School and associated brigades opened early in 1969. Although he was popular locally, he was soon in conflict with the Botswana Ministry of Education. He resigned after two years of bureaucratic frustration and returned to Britain at the end of 1971. Employee ownership Upon his return to the UK, Oakeshott threw himself into building workers' co-operatives, a cause that remained his mission for the next three decades. In 1973 he was the driving force in launching Sunderlandia, a builders' co-operative in Sunderland that for several years attempted to put egalitarian principles into action. Oakeshott drafted its initial articles of association, which were later compared to the Communist Manifesto. Although Sunderlandia eventually succumbed to economic downturn and internal divisions, it broke down many old prejudices. Its membership included a high proportion of apprentices, and women were recruited to become bricklayers and joiners. Oakeshott himself regularly contributed unskilled labour on the construction sites, following a custom acquired in Botswana. Following the dissolution of Sunderlandia, Oakeshott moved to London and began a systematic survey of worker's co- operatives. In particular he studied Mondrag√≥n, the large co-operative complex in the Basque region of Spain. During this period he wrote two further books on the subject: The Case for Workers' Cooperatives and Jobs and Fairness: The Logic and Experience of Employee Ownership. In 1979 Oakeshott founded Job Ownership Limited (JOL), a consultancy to advise on industrial co-ops and conversion to the employee-owned model. During the 1980s he proselytised with great energy and considerable success. In 2006 he and his colleagues renamed JOL as the Employee Ownership Association (EOA). In 2015 the EOA counted over 100 member companies, growing at 10% per year, with a total annual turnover approaching ¬£30 billion. In the 1990s, as businesses throughout Eastern Europe reorganised along market lines, Oakeshott persuaded the UK Foreign Office to give grants to JOL to promote employee ownership in several ex-communist countries. Its principles had obvious appeal, and Oakeshott enjoyed a number of successes, particularly with a wine co-operative in Bulgaria into which he poured personal funds. In 1999 Oakeshott retired as director of JOL. Treasured by his associates, he remained committed to the employee ownership movement until his death. Charitable initiatives \\"What is the good society?\\" Oakeshott often asked in conversation. His involvement with charitable organisations of all kinds provided in part an answer. He took up a wide range of causes, including girls‚Äô education in Africa (Camfed), prisoners' embroidery in Britain (Fine Cell Work), youth unemployment, refugees in Cairo, the facilitation of organ transplants (Give a Kidney), and multiple acts of private charity. Personal life Aside from a love of drinking, Oakeshott was renowned for hewing to a spartan regime. Ever supportive of others, he never found a companion for his own inner life. In his forties he briefly married Catherine Shuckburgh, but the marriage was quickly annulled by mutual consent. Until late in his life Oakeshott remained a regular contributor to The Spectator and The Economist, often writing reviews of books touching on Africa. In mid-2010 he suffered a stroke that forced him into institutional care, and he died a year later. He was survived by his twin brother Evelyn, his two sisters Helena and Rose, and seven nieces and two nephews. The Sunderland Home Care Associates have announced an annual Robert Oakeshott Award. His family and friends have created scholarships for African students in his name, and together with the Employee Ownership Association, have underwritten an annual Robert Oakeshott Memorial Lecture. In March 2013 the then Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg gave the inaugural inaugural lecture, in which he emphasised his government's commitment to employee ownership.

It was built in 1979 in memory of the county code of laws named fuero in Spanish. History The Plaza de los Fueros was built in 1979 by Eduardo Chillida and Luis Pe√±a Ganchegui, replacing the Plaza de Abastos previously located in the same place, a place where all kind of fresh products were sold. In 1878 an architect proposed a new project to build a public Plaza de Abastos, where all the citizens from Vitoria-Gasteiz could buy fresh food due to the bad condition of the stalls where those products were sold. The city commission of the public work accepted the idea and decided that the plaza would be built in the location where nowadays we can find the Plaza de los Fueros. Nevertheless, most of the local merchants started to complain against the new square, because of the loss that it would imply for their business. Due to that fact, the project was rejected for several years until 1897, when the mayor of Vitoria at that moment, Vicente Gonz√°lez de Echavarri, finally approved the proposal. The city architect, Javier Aguirre, elaborated a project for the plaza which included a square with a big modern building in the centre. The style of the building was avant-garde and modernist, with an iron structure and large windows. The project of the building was presented to the citizens in order to have their opinion. Though they disliked the idea, the city council decided to continue with the project. Finally, the Plaza de Abastos was finished in 1899, while the new mayor of Vitoria-Gasteiz was Federico Bar√°ibar. That plaza was only there for 76 years, and in January 1975, it was the last time it opened. Although the new project was not correctly seen by most of the citizens, the city council decided to demolish the building in order to construct a different plaza; the Plaza de Abastos was moved to the new Plaza de Santa B√°rbara, where it is nowadays located. After that, in 1976 it was decided that the Plaza de los Fueros would replace the Plaza de los Abastos, and it was finished and opened in 1979. However, the square has suffered many changes since that year, due to the accidents that have occurred since then. There have been changes in order to make the plaza safer, but those changes have not changed the aesthetics of the Plaza de los Fueros. Project The square is a combination of several monuments. Due to it, different figures and shapes can de distinguished, with the typical combinations of materials that Eduardo Chillida used in his works. Since it is an ensemble of many monuments, the plaza is divided in different parts such as a fronton, an undergrown bowling alley, a spacious area in order to be used for different events and some stairs which are located all around the plaza. It also includes a map of the county of Alava, and in the exact location of the Trebi√±o area a metal sculpture called \\"homage to the Fueros\\" is placed. This maps can only be seen from a bird's-eye view. The Plaza de los Fueros is basically made of pink granite. All the monuments that form this area were designed and built by Eduardo Chillida together with Luis Pe√±a Ganchegui. Location The square is located in the city centre of Vitoria-Gasteiz, in a crossing between Fueros, Postas and Independencia streets, together with the Correos square. It is surrounded by important buildings such as those which used to belong to kutxabank, the post office of Vitoria, and several flats. The whole area where it is located is a pedestrian one, where cars without an official permission are not allowed to enter in, and it is usually crowded at any time of the day. Uses of the square The Plaza de los Fueros is mostly used during the Virgen Blanca Festivities which take place in August. The plaza is used during those days for many entertainment activities such as concerts. The area is also used for Basque rural sports during the festivities such as The Basque Ball and aizkolaritza.

Fox was born in Sutton, Surrey and was educated at Sutton West School for Boys. He also took piano lessons and by his teens had formed his own group. This then led to him playing in an RAF band towards the end of the war, and upon being demobbed, he began his musical career, initially teaching during the day and playing ‚Äògigs‚Äô at night. He then went on to study at the Royal College of Music (RCM), studying composition, piano and violin. After leaving the RCM, Fox began to play in big bands, as well as arranging and accompanying singers. He then formed the resident band at the Grand Hotel, Eastbourne. He would spend the day arranging and composing and then drive to Eastbourne each night. It was at this time that he met the singer Joy Devon, who was to join the band and eventually become his wife. She played an important role co-producing recording projects and running their music publishing company, Coniston Music. While initially maintaining the residency at Eastbourne, he became a staff arranger for the BBC, writing for the BBC Variety and BBC Revue Orchestras. In the 1960s, these two orchestras were amalgamated to form the BBC Radio Orchestra. Fox became one of the regular conductors of the Radio Orchestra, writing thousands of arrangements for them, as well as producing original compositions. His close association with the orchestra carried on until it was disbanded in 1991. The John Fox Singers, made up of London session singers, were often added to the BBC Radio Orchestra sessions, as well as broadcasting in their own right in BBC programmes including Friday Night Is Music Night. John Fox was a regular contributor to the main BBC Radio Orchestra Show and also to String Sound, showcasing the strings of the Radio Orchestra, for which he wrote the signature tune, \\"String Magic\\". He also recorded numerous productions for the BBC with the John Fox Orchestra, led by George French, as well as with the other BBC Orchestras, particularly the BBC Midland Radio Orchestra, with him providing a large number of arrangements for their library. The John Fox Orchestra were heard in numerous programmes on Radio 2. As well as his work for the BBC, Fox also achieved success in the USA through his recordings for the American Beautiful Music Radio Stations that were active during the 1970s and 1980s. For these productions, particularly for the Bonneville Corporation, Fox would record selections with his orchestra at CTS or Lansdowne Studios. Commercial Records include George Gershwin BBC Records REB 156 (Reissued under title Gershwin's Greatest Hits, BBC Records REC 32) and Here There and Everywhere BBC Records REB 168. As a composer, John Fox was a prolific writer of library music, particularly for Sonoton Production Music, for who he would record his original compositions with orchestras in Leipzig, Budapest and London. These recording made his compositions available to a worldwide market, for use in television, radio, film and advertising productions, gaining additional wide exposure from usage on SpongeBob SquarePants. In 1994, Fox won a STEMRA Music Award for the best film music in the Netherlands. Throughout his career, Fox composed concert music, including Countryside Suite, Characters from the Fairy Tales, Strings in 3/4, A Surrey Rhapsody, Jovial Knights Overture, A Pastoral Reflection, Summer Overture and The Love of Joy Suite (composed in tribute to his late wife, Joy Devon). He continued to compose until near the end of his life. John Fox died on 10 February 2015, aged 90, in hospital near his home in Banstead Village, Surrey, and was survived by his wife, Perpetua.

Her artistic work is widely recognized in the field of electronic literature, and her scholarship on digital textuality has been widely published. She holds a Ph.D. in Digital Poetics and Digital Art at the Chelsea College of Arts of the University of the Arts London and studied English Philology at the Complutense University of Madrid. Menc√≠a's work has been featured in galleries as installation art, presented at conferences and art festivals, published on the Internet, and included in various curated collections of electronic literature, such as The Electronic Literature Collection, Volume 1, an anthology available on the Internet and on compact disc, edited by N. Katherine Hayles, Nick Montfort, Scott Rettberg, and Stephanie Strickland, and the Electronic Literature as a Model of Creativity and Innovation in Practice (ELMCIP) project funded by the Humanities in the European Research Area (HERA). In addition to earning recognition in the English-speaking world, Menc√≠a‚Äôs work is frequently mentioned in Spanish media. Critical reception Literary critic and media scholar N. Katherine Hayles considers Menc√≠a's work at the intersection of human and nonhuman through media transformation. Within the history of literacy, Hayles takes Menc√≠a's work as an exploration of the disassociation of sound from a stable textual referent in a digital environment. Hayles thus sees Menc√≠a's work as transcending electronic literature as a literary form to offer insight into the \\"media transformations and the conditions that make literacy possible.\\" Media scholar Christopher Funkhouser, in tracing the evolution of digital poetry, has considered Menc√≠a's work to be \\"inventing a new media language\\" through her innovative use of images and sound, much in the tradition of intermedia. Menc√≠a‚Äôs 2001 project ‚Äò‚ÄôAnother Kind of Language‚Äô‚Äô has been interpreted as a commentary on linguistic imperialism in the 21st century, juxtaposing and destabilizing Global English with Mandarin Chinese and Arabic. Hypermedia artist/writer Talan Memmott describes the project as an example of \\"signifying harmonics,\\" and discusses the ways in which the project's transfer from installation piece to Web project diminishes the original auditory experience of the interweaving of the three languages. Menc√≠a‚Äôs Birds Singing Other Birds‚Äô Songs, an interactive experience in which images of birds fly across the screen at the user's prompting, singing human-generated bird calls with the corresponding onomatopoeias written on the bird, has generated significant scholarly and popular attention. Media critic Scott Rettberg conceives of the project, with its abstract use of language, within the tradition of 20th century avant-garde movements, especially Dada sound poetry, rejecting what he sees as the common focus on novelty in electronic literature. Media scholar and archeologist Lori Emerson sees the project as a comment on the translation process, from bird to human languages and back. In her emphasis on electronic literature, Emerson criticizes Birds Singing Other Birds‚Äô Songs for not taking full advantage of the digital medium as an essential component of the message of the piece. In contrast to Emerson, Hayles considers how the project plays with various forms of cognition via the creation of hybrid beings where the human and nonhuman come together to create a new way of knowing. Additionally, Hayles describes Birds as \\"a reenactment of the history of literacy\\" in its move from sound to writing to pictorial (digital) iconography. Menc√≠a‚Äôs choice of birds as the subject of her work has even been interpreted within the long literary tradition of bird representations as a reflection on the distortion and recreation of orality and the transformation of iconography from human code (writing) into bird's code.

The band reached regional success for their transition from garage rock to the psychedelic rock genre, and the controversary aroused from their single, \\"Mary Jane\\". The band released one studio album before its disbandment in 1968. History In 1966, the band formed as The Complete Unknowns, with Rick Bieniewski on bass guitar, Jacques Hutchinson on lead guitar and vocals, and Dean Nimmer and Wayne Will both playing the drums. The band began as a garage rock band playing the popular songs associated with the genre during the period. Following their first tour in Wisconsin, Will was drafted to fight in the Vietnam War, so the band replaced him with multi- instrumentalist Jay Borkenhagen. With the new member, the band shifted their musical identity to accompass psychedelic rock, and changed the group name to The Baroques. The band became notable for its baroque-like keyboards, fuzz guitar riffs, and outright freak-out jams. The band's live performances drew the attention of Chess Records in January 1967. The label, primarily known for releasing R&B; material, signed the band in an effort to incorporate a new marketing opportunity. The band went to record their debut single in Ter Mer Studios, located in Chicago. The single, both conceived of original material by Borkenhagen, was produced by Ralph Bass. In June 1967, the band released their debut single, \\"Mary Jane\\" b/w \\"Iowa, A Girl's Name\\", which was banned by locals radio stations within a week of the release for perceived pro-drug references. In reality, there were no pro-drug references and the A-side, \\"Mary Jane\\", was intended as an anti-drug statement. The controversy brought regional acclaim for the band, and they became known for their eccentric live performances. Following the banning of their single, the band released their only LP, The Baroques, which included the two songs from the single. The album became a regional hit, but the band was unable to branch out of state as their label was not well-known to distribute rock albums, let alone psychedelic rock. Still, the band was at its peak of popularity and was performing in an increased amount of gigs, but Chess Records dropped them from their label. One final self-financed effort was produced in 1968, but with the small marketing the single only reached regional acclaim. The band disbanded later that year. Jay Borkenhagen went on to California and recorded an LP in the 1970s with a band called Feather. Jacques Hutchinson became a professor of communication at the University of Colorado. Dean Nimmer became an art professor at Massachusetts College of Art. Rick Bieniewski became a traveling salesman.J. Worthington Worth III, Liner Notes \\"Purple Day\\" Album. Distortion Records, 1995. In January 1995, a compilation album called Purple Day was released on the Distortion label that was arranged with the help of the past band members. The compilation includes all of the tracks from their studio album along with outtakes and unreleased tracks. In 1997, \\"Mary Jane\\" was re-released on the psychedelic rock compilation, Psychedelic Crown Jewels, Vol. 1.

Margaret Bell never married, and died in 1969. Department of Physical Education for Women Margaret Bell was a firm advocate for women's athletics and physicality. Despite the belief of others in her time‚Äîthat athletic competition was harmful to women, both psychologically and sociologically‚Äîshe believed that intense competition was important for women to explore their role as women, wives, and mothers. She believed it was important for women to participate in all sports, as it helped them socially and emotionally.Peckham, Howard H. \\"The Golden Years.\\" In The Making of the University of Michigan, 1817-1967, 107. Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 1967. Under her tenure as Chairman of the Program of Physical Education for Women, women's athletics grew extensively. When Bell arrived at the University of Michigan, women had both separate gymnasiums and fields than the men. Women met and played in the Barbour Gymnasium, which had been built in 1896 as the counterpart to the all-male Waterman Gymnasium, and women played on Palmer Field, the counterpart to the all-male Ferry Field.Bell, Margaret. Michigan Alumnus, January 4, 1936. Box 3, Publications. Margaret Bell Collection. Michigan Historical Collections. Bentley Historical Library, Ann Arbor, MI. 20 February 2015. Bell was director of the Barbour Gymnasium and helped fight to raise money to expand the physical education facilities for women. As Chairman of the Program of Physical Education for Women, Bell overlooked the activities that occurred at Barbour Gymnasium and Palmer Field, including physical education courses, dances, and open gymnasium times where women could come and meet other female students from around the University. In 1927, when the famous Michigan Stadium, or \\"Big House\\", was built, the Board in Control of Athletics also gave $250,000 for a field and field house for women. The board admitted that improvements were needed in intercollegiate athletics, something that Bell had been trying to prove since she arrived at the university. Before these improvements, Palmer Field was uneven land, difficulty to play on. Palmer Field was leveled out at that time, and the field house was erected. She finally received the money for women's athletics, and a Women's Athletics Building was built on Palmer Field, between the campus and the Detroit ObservatoryPeckham, Howard H. \\"Embattled President Little.\\" In The Making of the University of Michigan, 1817-1967, 184.

Retrieved March 21, 2015, from She aspired to have health examinations become a fundamental aspect of the physical education system. In the years between 1930-1944, Bell wrote extensively about health examinations. World War II, especially, solidified the need for these examinations in Bell's mind. She believed that in order for women to efficiently replace men in their jobs while they were off at war, there was an immense need for women to engage in healthy habits, such as sufficient amounts of sleep, relaxation and meditation, mental hygiene, and regular exercise. Bell believed the best way to monitor the success of women following this plan was to encourage family doctors to fill out a physical examination form that would include information on health history, examination findings, any diagnoses, and the doctor's recommendations for each female student and her health. She wanted these medical cards to be filed in schools and made available to the appropriate school faculty.Bell, Margaret. Health Examinations. Box 2, Articles ‚Äì Health Examinations Folder. Margaret Bell Collection. Michigan Historical Collections. Bentley Historical Library, Ann Arbor, MI. 4 February 2015. Bell also encouraged her students to become physical education teachers, as she recognized her own vocation as one that truly developed young people into full, healthy adults.Bell, Margaret. Physical Education as a Vocation. Box 3, Publications Folder. Margaret Bell Collection. Michigan Historical Collections. Bentley Historical Library, Ann Arbor, MI. 12 February 2015. She believed that physical education did more than help develop muscles, but in the end, also helped mental and moral culture. She was very proud of her occupation, and wanted to ensure that future youth could also develop in the same way that she felt she developed her students. She gave talks on multiple campuses, trying to ignite interest in a career in physical education in female students across the east and Midwest.Bell, Margaret.

Margaret Bell Pool Margaret Bell Pool groundbreaking Perhaps Bell's biggest accomplishment was the creation of an all women's pool in 1954, which Bell believed was a necessity for the 5400 female students attending the University of Michigan. It was a million dollar swimming pool for women, financed from a grant given by the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics. The board gave the Women's Physical Education Department $3,500,000, and the pool used up $1,000,000 of this.Bell, Margaret. Letter to McPhee, Harry R., 29 March 1954.

From 1947-1951, Bell served on a joint committee between the National Education Association and the American Medical Association which wrote \\"The Physical Educator Asks About Health\\", a document discussing the responsibility of the school to have a well-defined health policy, but in the absence of such a policy, the physical educator needs to initiate its development.Margaret, Bell. \\"The Physical Educator Asks about Health.\\" NEA and AMA: Joint Committee on Health Problems in Education, March 1947.

American Association for Health, Physical Education, and Recreation: 1939‚Äì1940 Bell became president of the American Association for Health, Physical Education, and Recreation in 1939, now called the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance. She served as president for one year. Throughout her presidency, Bell proposed to more intensely permeate in people's minds the importance of physical education. She wanted responsibility placed on schools nationwide to ensure students were performing at an adequate level physically.Margaret, Bell. The Journal of Health and Physical Education. November 1938.

The telegram urged Bell, among with three others, to come to Washington D.C. to discuss \\"urgent problems relating to the U.S. Office of Education\\". Studebaker was concerned that the American men going off to war were not physically fit enough to successfully fight. He believed that the only way to fix this was to make physical education a larger part of the school system. On July 29, 1944, Bell attended the meeting, where the group proposed \\"adequate staff in elementary, secondary, higher and vocational education in the fields of health services, health instruction, physical education, athletics, and recreation\\".Bell, Margaret, Hughes, Pritzlaff, and Miller.

Michigan Historical Collection, Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan. Ann Arbor, MI. Published opinions on views on gender and sexism Margaret Bell spoke against those who believed that the menstrual process disallowed women from being active. This was the belief of this time period, and Bell was active in the movement to quiet this stigma. In 1954, in a letter to Dr. MacPhee, who worked with the Department of Health at Princeton University, Bell emphasized that \\"it can be said with some confidence that no appropriate team or individual competitive sport will injure the physical health of the normal girl or woman\\". She did not agree with the criticism against women's competition that mostly had to do with the fear of harming the reproductive tracts of women. Bell suggested that these \\"accusations do not seem very realistic since it is difficult to conceive of injuries of the reproductive tract through sports competition\\". Bell believed the stigma around menstruation was the single worst factor that was limiting the successes of women in the job markets. She made it her mission to inform the ignorant on the subject. Bell wrote an article in Hygeia: The Health Magazine of the American Medical Association in March 1942, entitled \\"Answers to Practical Questions on Menstruation\\". In this article, she discussed the normalcy and importance of menstruation for the average woman, and that it should be not looked at with disdain or disgust, or as a sickness of any kind. She encouraged women to continue exercising during menstruation, and emphasized that it does not contaminate others at all. Further, in an attempt to quiet this time period's critiques that suggested physical competition was harmful for women's reproductive abilities, Bell commented that the \\"purpose of the reproductive organs is to add satisfaction to the lives of women as well as men. A young woman should look forward to being a companionable wife and a worthy mother, as a man looks forward to being a good husband and a good father. Understanding and respect for one's sex have a great deal to contribute to the stability and progress of civilization\\".Bell, Margaret.

Bentley Historical Library, Ann Arbor, MI. 12 February 2015. Bell's view on the working woman Bell's views on women working changed profoundly throughout her life. Despite being a working woman herself, Bell spoke prominently about the importance of women at home in the economy during the economic crisis of the Great Depression. At a speech she gave at the Y.W.C.A. in Detroit on April 23, 1934, Bell discussed the many valuable identities of the non-working woman. Those that were homemakers, Bell said, were important because they stimulated qualities of spirit and soul. Bell explained that she believed women and men were different, and should not compete in the job markets, but should instead supplement each other. During the Great Depression, there was an ideology that women should work to help contribute to the finances of the family. Bell, however, disagreed with this. She believed that women working were a \\"mistake in values\\", and that women should move back to the home and work on making a family. She believed women needed to \\"fulfill [their] womanly obligations\\".Bell, Margaret. 4th Annual Health Week, Y.W.C.A., Detroit. April 23, 1934. Leisure Time Health Building. Box 3, Publications Folder. Margaret Bell Collection. Michigan Historical Collections. Bentley Historical Library, Ann Arbor, MI. 12 February 2015. Completely changing her tune from the Great Depression almost a decade earlier, Bell believed the advancement of women was dependent on women's physical health. In the midst of World War II, Bell was adamant that girls needed to have endurance, skill, and agility in order to \\"replace her brother on the home front in industry and in community life\\". Bell wanted to take advantage of the men being off at war, as she believed it posed a \\"great opportunity for women to demonstrate the great range of [their] capacities\\". She believed the only way to accomplish this was to increase the physical fitness of women, which would allow them to increase their strength, skill, and speed of actions and movement. Doing so, Bell felt, would allow women to both be more vigorous in their own lives, but more importantly, serve the country in the wake of World War II. She believed the role of women in the war effort was to replace the men in their jobs that they could no longer do due to the war, and she felt that physical fitness was crucial in being able to do so.Bell, M.D., Margaret. \\"Health Examinations Help to Promote Physical Fitness.\\" The Nation's Schools 31, no. 4 (1943): 25-26.

Damhus Meadow (), once a part of the lake, is located on the north side of the lake. History Damhus Lake is an artificial lake which was created some time during the Middle Ages when a dam was built on Harrestrup River (Harrestrup √Ö). The first known reference to it is from 1561 when king Frederick II gives it to the University of Copenhagen. From 1618, the lake played a role in Copenhagen's water supply. It was then known as Langevadsdam. The name referred to the \\"Lange vad\\" (\\"long ford\\") to the south of the lake. The lake's current southern shoreline was defined in 1620-21 when an embankment was built across marshy stretch for the new Roskilde Road. The aim of the embankment was not only to protect the road against flooding but also to secure a more stable supply of water to Copenhagen by raising the water level in the lake. The water drained into St. J√∏rgen's Lake closer to the city through the artificial Ladeg√•rd Canal. The Roskilde Road was a toll road until 1915. A building at the southwestern corner of the lake, Langevadsdamhuset, colloquially known as Damhuset, served as toll house. The lake gradually got its contemporary name from this toll house around 1800. In 1849, a new embankment was constructed across the lake, separating it in two. In the 1920s and 1930s, Harestrup √Ö caused frequent floodings and it had also become known for its unpleasant odour. In 1938 it was therefore decided to regulate it in connection with the city's establishment of the new public park Vigerslevparken. The stream was disconnected from the northern part of the lake, known as Bags√∏en (\\"The Rear Lake\\"), which was drained and converted ito present-day Damhusengen (Damhus Meadow). In 1941, both lake and meadow were given status as public park. They were protected by the Conservation Authority in 1966.

The conflict with Turkish forces ultimately proved inconclusive. The rebellion in the Sanjak of Smederevo and militia's operations resulted in the period of Habsburg-occupied Serbia, which took place from 1788 to 1792. Ultimately, the Serbian volunteer corps had the legacy of promoting the creation of future paramilitaries, such as during the First Serbian Uprising. History A Serbian freikorps of 5,000 soldiers had been established in Banat (Banat Military Frontier), composed of refugees that had fled earlier conflicts in the Ottoman Empire. The Corps would fight for liberation of Serbia and unification under Habsburg rule. The main commander was the Austrian major Mihailo Mihaljeviƒá. There were several freikorps along the Habsburg-Ottoman frontier. Mihaljeviƒá's Free Corps, the most notable, was active from ≈†umadija to Podrinje, and across the Morava there was the Braniƒçevo Free Corps; in Croatia the St. George Free Corps; in Bosnia they were called Seressaner. Other Serb militias were the Kozara Militia and Prosar Militia, established in Bosnia in 1788, composed of 1,000 soldiers each. Among volunteers were Aleksa Nenadoviƒá and Karaƒëorƒëe Petroviƒá, Stanko Aramba≈°iƒá and the prominent Radiƒç Petroviƒá and most distinguished of all, Koƒça Anƒëelkoviƒá. The Orthodox clergy in Serbia supported the rebellion. Koƒça's militia quickly took over Palanka and Batoƒçina, attacked Kragujevac, and reached the Constantinople road, cutting off the Ottoman army from Sanjak of Ni≈° and Sanjak of Vidin. The Austrians used the Corps in two failed attempts to seize Belgrade, in late 1787 and early 1788. Organization According to a document from 6 November 1789, the Free Corps included: * 1 squadron of hussars, * 18 companies of fusiliers, * and 4 companies of musketeers, with a total of 5,049 soldiers. Dress Their uniforms were similar to that of the frontiersmen, with some changes. Aftermath In 1793, the Austrians established the new free corps on the border, for Serbians and Bosnians. Legacy On the eve of the First Serbian Uprising, the U≈æice and Sokol nahije established volunteer detachments, called frajkori, that had the task of sabotage against Ottoman military plans, and their concentration in this region of Serbia.

In the 1960s he managed the Playhouse, a Greenwich Village coffee house where he took pictures of musicians who played there. He was encouraged to pursue photography by rock photographer Jim Marshall. His 1965 photograph of Johnny Cash and guitarist Luther Perkins backstage at Carnegie Hall was used in the 2019 mini-series Country Music. Stevens did not have formal training in photography and worked as road manager for Miriam Makeba and The Lovin' Spoonful. He met Marshall again at Woodstock and decided he \\"had an eye\\" for photography and would make it his career. Moving to England in the early 1970s, Stevens was identified in the International Times by the photo credit \\"Captain Snaps\\" because he did not have a work permit. \\"Captain Snaps\\" became a nickname. One of his first employers was Paul McCartney, who hired him to photograph the Wings Over Europe tour on the recommendation of his wife Linda McCartney. Stevens worked several years for the New Musical Express before returning to New York City, where he photographed musicians performing at the club CBGB, including Debbie Harry and the Ramones. Several of his images are considered iconic. One is of Paul McCartney hiding in Linda's arms during the couple's arrest for marijuana possession following a Wings concert in Gothenburg, Sweden, on Aug. 10, 1972.

When the group broke up in San Francisco, he helped lead singer Johnny Rotten (John Lydon) fly to New York City, where Rotten stayed in the photographer's apartment before returning to London. In 2011, Stevens told an entertainment publication that he saw himself as a chronicler of history.Coughlin, Hippo In 2015, Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth told a reporter that Stevens \\"was really the bridge between New York and London...

History In 2003, Loren L. Coleman created the company InMediaRes Productions, which he founded with Heather Coleman, Randall Bills, Tara Bills, and Philip DeLuca. InMediaRes received their licence for the electronic publication of Classic Battletech fiction from WizKids in the fall of 2003. They made an announcement that year at GenCon 36 and had their full website, BattleCorps.com, ready to go a year later in August 2004. InMediaRes kicked things off with the fiction of founders Bills and Coleman, and from there, month-by-month they continued with their electronic delivery model. InMediaRes announced their plans to create a similar \\"Holostreets\\" web site for Shadowrun fiction in 2005 but have not done so. Some of the fiction from the BattleCorps website has made it to print as Battletech Corps Vol. 1: The Corps (2008) and Battletech Corps Vol. 2: First Strike (2010) ‚Äì following some changes to InMediaRes' licence in 2007 and 2008. In 2007, Rob Boyle and Bills tried to buy FanPro LLC from Fantasy Productions and when that did not work out WizKids stepped in to mediate; although they were not willing to let Boyle and Bills create a new company, they were willing to give the Battletech and Shadowrun licenses to InMediaRes. After acquiring the rights to both FASA games, InMediaRes took on Boyle and Bills as regular staff ‚Äì which had been part of the agreement with WizKids. Boyle remained as the Shadowrun Line Editor for the next few years, while Bills became a Managing Director of InMediaRes. InMediaRes created a subsidiary to hold their new gaming rights: Catalyst Game Labs. InMediaRes placed a higher value on electronic material, and in 2007 started charging for Catalyst's Shadowrun releases. Company information InMediaRes Productions was founded in 2003 by Loren & Heather Coleman, Tara & Randall N.

InMediaRes Productions, LLC and WizKids, Inc in talks for rights to publish Classic BattleTech fiction. (¬©2002‚Äì2007 WizKids Inc.)

It was formed when the competitive power generation business of PPL Corporation was spun off and immediately combined with competitive generation businesses owned by private equity firm Riverstone Holdings. Following these transactions, PPL shareholders owned 65% of Talen's common stock and affiliates of Riverstone owned 35%. As a condition for FERC approval Talen agreed to divest approximately 1,300 megawatts of generating assets in the PJM Interconnection Region to mitigate FERC's competitiveness concerns. On December 6, 2016, Riverstone Holdings completed the purchase of the remaining 65% of Talen's common stock, making it a privately owned company. History According to the Director of Corporate Communications the name \\"Talen Energy\\" symbolizes talent of the people who work for the company and energy in terms of the product it produces and what employees bring to their jobs. Talen \\"represents the idea of talented people energized to succeed.\\" The company's colors of green and yellow were chosen based on then-CEO Paul Farr's love of the Green Bay Packers. Today, the company's logo is simply black and white. On June 10, 2014, PPL announced that it would spin off its competitive energy business which would merge with Riverstone Holdings' operations to create Talen. The transaction needed approval from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the FERC, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission before its completion. On February 2, 2015, PPL and Riverstone accepted the FERC's mitigation option in order to receive approval from FERC. The Pennsylvania PUC approval followed on March 11, 2015 when the PUC approved the transfer of PPL Electric Utilities' ownership in PPL Interstate Energy Company to Talen. The NRC's approval for the transfer of the Susquehanna Nuclear Plant licenses came on April 10, 2015 and on April 23, 2015, PPL received the final regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Justice. Talen Energy launched on June 1, 2015. PPL shareholders initially owned 65 percent and Riverstone owned 35% of the shares of the new company, whose shares trade on the NYSE under the symbol TLN. On June 2, 2015, Paul Farr, President and CEO of Talen, and other executives rang the opening bell on the NYSE in celebration of the Talen Energy launch. On October 8, 2015, Talen announced the sale of Ironwood Natural Gas plant to a TransCanada subsidiary for 654 million USD, and Holtwood and Wallenpaupack Hydro plants to Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners of Hamilton, Bermuda for 860 million USD.http://www.marketwatch.com/story/talen-energy-to-sell-3-power-plants- for-15-billion-2015-10-08 Facilities and infrastructure Talen owns 15,320 megawatts of power generating capacity, and employs over 500 people in its headquarters in Allentown, as well as 3,000 others at plant locations in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Texas, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Montana. It is the fourth-largest publicly traded independent power producer in the country. Talen's generation facilities include nuclear, coal fired and natural gas power plants. The largest plant is the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, a 2,700 MWe nuclear power plant, located on the Susquehanna River seven miles (11 km) northeast of Berwick, Pennsylvania.

The process is sometimes referred to as relining. In cases of extreme decay, the original canvas may be completely removed and replaced. Purpose The purpose of lining a painting is to flatten or consolidate its surface or strengthen its support by attaching a new canvas to the back of the existing one. The process has sometimes been referred to as relining. In cases of extreme decay, the original layer canvas may be completely removed, and the new canvas fixed to the priming on the reverse of the paint layer. Lining has been very widely practiced, and during the 19th century, some painters had their works lined immediately after, or sometimes even before, completion. There have been some doubts concerning its benefits more recently, especially since the Greenwich Comparative Lining Conference of 1974. Method The procedure as carried out in the 19th century is described by Theodore Henry Fielding in his Knowledge and Restoration of Old Paintings (1847). The picture was removed from the stretcher and laid on a flat surface. The edges of the canvas were trimmed, leaving the original support smaller than the new lining. A sheet of paper covered in thin paste was laid on the surface of the painting, which was then placed face-down on a board or table. The back of the picture was then coated with paste, copal varnish, or a glue made from cheese. The new lining canvas was pressed down onto the back of the picture by hand; then the outer edges of the lining cloth were fastened to the table by means of a large number of tacks, and a piece of wood with a rounded edge was passed over the back of the cloth, to ensure perfect adhesion. When the glue had dried sufficiently, the lining was smoothed with a moderately hot iron. Fielding cautions that \\"the greatest care must be taken that the hand does not stop for an instant, or the mark of the iron will be so impressed on the painting, that nothing can obliterate it.\\" The picture was then nailed to a new stretcher, and the paper was washed off with a sponge and cold water. Fielding also describes the process for the complete removal and replacement of the canvas. In this, the picture was covered with paper, as if for lining, then fastened to a board or table, after which the old cloth was rubbed away with a small rasp with very fine teeth; when the restorer had gone \\"as far as may be prudent\\", the remainder of the cloth could be taken off with a pumice stone, until the ground on which the picture was painted became visible. It was then ready to receive its new cloth, which had previously been covered with copal varnish, glue, or paste. In this procedure, the hot iron was not used. The use of hand- ironing is liable to produce a flattening of impasto. This problem was mitigated by the introduction in the 1950s of vacuum hot-table processes, designed for use with wax-resin adhesives, which exerted a more even pressure on the paint surface; however the longer periods of heating and high temperatures involved often led to other types of textural alteration. Wax- based adhesives seem to have been in use for lining from the 18th century, although the earliest well-documented case of their employment is in the lining of Rembrandt's Night Watch in 1851. Although, initially, pure beeswax was used, mixtures incorporating resins such as dammar and mastic, or balsams such as Venice turpentine, were soon found preferable. During the 20th century, it came to be realised that the impregnation of the paint layer with wax could have deleterious effects, including darkening of the picture, especially where canvas or ground were exposed. Although experiments with synthetic fabrics were carried out during the 1960s and 1970s, traditional linen cloths are still usually used for lining. However polyester canvas is often used for strip-lining, where only the edges of the painting are backed, and for loose-lining, in which no adhesive is used. This latter technique helps protect the painting from atmospheric pollution, but does not flatten or consolidate the paint surface.

Landon Lecture Series is a series of speeches on current public affairs, which is organized and hosted by Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas. It is named after Kansas politician Alf Landon, former Governor of Kansas and Republican presidential candidate. The first lecture in the series was given by Landon on December 13, 1966. The lecture series has been described as \\"prestigious,\\" and Eric Lichtblau noted in his 2008 book Bush's Law: The Remaking of American Justice that the \\"Landon Lecture Series has provided an unlikely but powerful platform allowing world leaders, from Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev to Jimmy Carter and Henry Kissinger, to expound on the critical public issues of the day.\\" Among the speakers who have delivered Landon Lectures are nine Nobel laureates, eight Pulitzer Prize- winners, and more than 40 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients.  Notable speeches  Seven of the ten men to serve as U.S. President since the series began in 1966 have delivered Landon lectures (excluding Lyndon B. Johnson, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump). George W. Bush (2006), Ronald Reagan (1982) and Richard Nixon (1970) delivered speeches during their tenure in office. Bill Clinton (2007), Jimmy Carter (1991) and Gerald Ford (1978) spoke after leaving office. George H. W. Bush delivered a Landon Lecture while serving as Vice President of the United States in 1985, before being elected to the Presidency. Before Reagan delivered his Landon Lecture as U.S. President in 1982, he previously spoke in the series in 1967, while Governor of California. Other sitting U.S. federal officials to speak in the series include: Vice President Walter Mondale; Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield; Minority Leaders Hugh Scott, Howard Baker and Tom Daschle; House Speakers Tip O'Neill and Jim Wright; Supreme Court justices Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor and Sonia Sotomayor; and Attorney General Janet Reno. In addition, nine current or former foreign heads of state have also spoken in the series, including former Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, former Malawian President Joyce Banda, and former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo.  Robert F. Kennedy (1968)  U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy was one of twenty-two active U.S. Senators to deliver a lecture in the series (including also his brother Ted Kennedy in 1984). Kennedy's speech on March 18, 1968, \\"Conflict in Vietnam and at Home\\", is notable for being the first speech Kennedy delivered after announcing his much-anticipated candidacy for the U.S. presidency two days earlier. The campaign speech was attended by a crowd of 14,500 people, and Kennedy used the opportunity to share anti-war views on the Vietnam War. Evan Thomas wrote in his biography of Kennedy that \\"the setting was ideal for a raucous campaign kickoff.\\" Kennedy was assassinated less than three months later, on June 6, 1968, after winning the California Democratic primary.  Gen. William Westmoreland (1969)  U.S. General William Westmoreland, a main target for student protests against the Vietnam War, spoke on April 9, 1969. The alternative newspaper in Lawrence, Kansas, wrote afterwards: \\"The man himself came to speak to the students of Kansas State. Yes, General William Westmoreland decided to deliver his first college lecture since returning from Viet Nam here, and he could not have picked a better place. Kansas State students will be courteous at all times... The General was greeted by applause, by cheering, by approval.\\"  Richard Nixon (1970)  U.S. President Richard Nixon spoke at the Landon Lecture Series on September 16, 1970. As student protestors gathered outside, Nixon delivered what the Christian Science Monitor called \\"one of the strongest and most uncompromising speeches of his career,\\" denouncing the protests as part of a \\"cancerous disease\\" that is gripping the United States. Nixon asserted: \\"we face the greatest crisis in the history of American education today.\\" The complete speech was aired on network television, and then rebroadcast on several local stations after Nixon supporters purchased time to re-air it.  Ian Smith (1980)  Former Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith was scheduled to deliver a Landon Lecture on October 31, 1980. The speech was disrupted by protestors objecting to the denial of voting rights to blacks in the former Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) under Smith's governance. Due to the controversy, the speech was recategorized as a non-Landon Lecture and is not included in the history of the series.  Ashleigh Banfield (2003)  MSNBC news reporter Ashleigh Banfield delivered a Landon Lecture on April 24, 2003. Banfield used the forum to raise concerns regarding media coverage of the Iraq War. She spoke against \\"cable news operators who wrap themselves in the American flag and go after a certain target demographic\\" and specifically named Fox News Channel as an example. The New York Times reported that her speech angered NBC management, who rebuked her and lowered her profile.  George W. Bush (2006)  On January 23, 2006, U.S. President George W. Bush spoke at the Landon Lecture, one month after news reports broke the story of the U.S. government's warrantless wiretapping of telephone conversations in the United States. In his Landon Lecture, Bush gave the domestic wiretapping program the name of \\"Terrorist Surveillance Program\\" for the first time. Before Bush's speech, NPR aired a piece comparing Bush's Landon Lecture speech to Nixon's appearance in the series in 1970, noting both were defending their national security policies \\"as public discontent with a foreign war persists.\\"  Landon Lecture speakers  Defense Secretary Robert Gates delivering a Landon Lecture in November 2007 Through March 2017 there have been 177 Landon Lectures, featuring 180 speakers. The most recent speaker was Joyce Banda, the former president of Malawi, who spoke on January 29, 2018.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built in 1875 by Wohlsen and Ehlers. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  St George's Church of England, Beenleigh, circa 1912 The Reverend Dubois was appointed as the Church of England minister for Beenleigh in March 1871, preaching his services in the local court house. By August 1871, the congregation were planning to build a church. However, by March 1873, plans for the church slowed when Dubois left the district and the Bishop of Brisbane failed to appoint a replacement minister. In January 1874, the Reverend James Gilbertson was appointed to the district and planning resumed, calling for tenders in May 1874. The church was built in 1875 by Wohlsen and Ehlers to a design by prominent Brisbane architect FDG Stanley. It was built on land donated by local pioneer Michael Tansey in the street which bears his name. It was officially opened on Thursday 16 September 1875. It was the first church built in Beenleigh. The town was then part of the Southport Parish and later a mission district before becoming a parish in 1982. A new church (also called St George's Anglican Church) was built next door at 10 Tansey Street in 1964. In 1981 the old church building was moved to its present site at the Beenleigh Historical Village and repaired. The current church, built 1964  Description  This single-skin timber church is a one storey building on low concrete stumps with steeply pitched galvanised corrugated iron gable roofs. It is now prominently located facing Main Street in the Beenleigh Historical Village. The church is rectangular in plan with an attached chancel on the northern end. The chancel is narrower in width and has a lower roof than the nave. A gabled porch located on the western side is the only point of entry. The walls consist of vertical jointed (VJ) boards fixed to an exposed stud frame that is decoratively patterned with cross bracing. Inclined timber members fixed above the bottom plate shed water away from the walls, protecting structural timbers. The raked soffits are lined with diagonal beaded timber boards that continue internally to form a raked ceiling. The entry and front facade gable are decorated with curved and diagonal timber members. Four timber steps lead to the timber entry porch. Arched double doors constructed of diagonal timber boards open directly from the porch onto the main space of the church. This space is interrupted only by a screen enclosure in the south west corner. The chancel has a raised timber floor and is framed by a chancel arch. The rafters are exposed below the diagonally boarded ceiling. Trusses are formed where timber tie beams are attached to the underside of four of the rafters and connected back to the walls by curved timber braces. Tall slender casement windows are arranged in groups of three in the end walls and singularly in the side walls. A replica of the original timber bell tower is located in front of the church.

The Casas family perform primarily in Mexico but have made appearances in the United States of America, Canada, Europe and Japan over the years. History The Casas family started in lucha libre in 1964 when Jos√© Casas Granados started wrestling under the ring name Pepe Casas. A second-generation of Casas brothers is also active wrestlers starting with Pepe Casas' oldest son Jos√© Casas works under the ring name Negro Casas, younger siblings Jorge Luiz works as El Felino and Erick Casas is better known as Heavy Metal. Pepe Casas has at least one other son, a son who is not involved in wrestling at all but whose children are also third-generation Casas wrestlers. Jorge Luiz' sons are also professional wrestlers, working as masked wrestlers Tiger and Puma, while sons and daughters of another Casas brother (or brothers) are wrestlers are working under the ring names Canelo Casas, Danny Casas, Destroyer and Nanyzh Rock. A cousin on Pepe Casas has worked under the ring name \\"Black Star\\", one of multiple Luchadors to use that name. Jos√© Casas is married to Panamanian professional wrestler Dalys la Caribe√±a, whom he also trained for her in-ring career and he is the brother-in-law of Rafael Ernesto Medina Baeza, better known under the ring name Veneno (\\"Venum\\"). Jorge Luiz Casas is married to Blanca Rodriguez, who until the summer of 2014 wrestled as Princesa Blanca; Blanca Rodriquez is not the mother of Tiger and Puma. In Lucha Libre it is not uncommon for some wrestlers, especially masked wrestlers, to pay for the rights to use a well-established name and play a character that is supposedly a family member of a well known luchador family. This practice does not appear to apply to the Casas family as far as evidence suggests. but it is possible that the true parents of some of the third-generation wrestlers is not entirely accurate, for years Tiger and Puma claimed to be the nephews of Jorge Luiz (El Felino), but later revealed that they were indeed his sons but wanted to make a name for themselves instead of being \\"Felino Jr.\\" or \\"El Hijo del Felino\\" (\\"The Son of Felino\\").

It is approximately long and flows through Ransom Township, Taylor, and Old Forge. The watershed of the creek has an area of . It is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. However, it is considered to be impaired by flow alterations and siltation/sedimentation and is also an intermittent stream. There were historically two superfund sites on the creek. A number of bridges cross the creek and the Lehigh Valley Railroad historically passed through the watershed. Course Saint Johns Creek begins on Pinnacle Rock in Ransom Township. It flows east for a short distance before turning southeast for several tenths of a mile. It then turns south for several tenths of a mile and enters Taylor. At this point, the creek turns southeast again. After a few tenths of a mile, it turns south-southeast and then southwest, passing through a pond. It then turns west for several tenths of a mile before receiving an unnamed tributary from the right and turning south. After a few tenths of a mile, the creek turns south-southwest, crossing Rt 476, Pa Turnpike and receiving another unnamed tributary from the right. It then turns south-southeast and passes through another pond before turning southwest for a few miles, entering Old Forge and receiving a third unnamed tributary from the right. The creek eventually turns south for a few tenths of a mile before turning west and then south again. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, it reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River. Saint Johns Creek joins the Lackawanna River upriver of its mouth. Tributaries Saint Johns Creek has no officially named tributaries. However, it does have unofficially named tributaries such as Race Brook and Sawmill Creek. It also has one unnamed tributary. Hydrology Saint Johns Creek is considered to be impaired. The causes of impairment are flow alteration and siltation/sedimentation. The likely source of the impairment is abandoned mine drainage. The concentration of manganese in Saint Johns Creek above one of the former superfund sites on it was 38 parts per million in 1985. The concentration of zinc was 27 parts per million. Downstream of the former superfund site, the manganese concentration was 242 to 306 parts per million and the zinc concentration was 20 to 33 parts per million. Downstream of one of the former superfund sites on Saint Johns Creek, the concentration of acetone rangesd from 18.9 to 19.7 parts per billion and the concentration of methylene chloride ranged from 0 to 68 parts per billion in 1985. The concentration of 2-butanone ranged from 46.8 to 88.4 parts per billion and the concentration of 4-Methyl-2-pentanone ranged from 4.5 to 16.1 parts per billion. The concentration of Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Phthalate ranged from 0 to 468 parts per billion. Upstream of the former superfund site, the concentrations of acetone, 2-butanone, 4-Methyl-2-pentanone, and Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Phthalate were all 0 parts per billion. The concentration of methylene chloride ranged from 0 to 15 parts per billion. Saint Johns Creek loses its flow due to fissures created by mine subsidence. For this reason, it is dry except during and shortly after rain and is thus an intermittent stream. When it is not dry, its flow mainly consists of raw sewage. It also loses flow to a landfill. The mouth of the creek is from the Old Forge Borehole, one of the largest acid mine drainage sources in the Coal Region. There are some leachate seeps flowing into the creek. Environmental & Recycling Services, Inc. has a permit to discharge stormwater into Saint Johns Creek. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Saint Johns Creek is above sea level. The elevation near the source of the creek is between above sea level. There are three combined sewer overflow diversion chambers along Saint Johns Creek and its tributaries. The remains of water works can be found along the unofficially named tributary Race Brook and the tributary Sawmill Brook is in an artificial channel. Saint Johns Creek itself is also partially channelized in some locations. The headwaters of Saint Johns Creek are on West Mountain. It begins on springs on that mountain. The creek flows steeply downhill in its upper reaches before entering a nearly level floodplain near Keyser Avenue. Extensive deposits of culm and silt occur in the watershed of Saint Johns Creek. The deposits are left over from mining activity. Mine sheet XI and mine sheet XIII are in the vicinity of the creek. Watershed The watershed of Saint Johns Creek has an area of . The watershed is in the southwestern part of the Lackawanna River watershed. It occupies parts of Old Forge, Taylor, and Ransom Township, as well as a tiny corner of Newton Township. The mouth of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Pittston. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Scranton. The creek also passes through the quadrangle of Avoca. The Race Brook Falls are in the watershed of Saint Johns Creek. The Old Forge High School Campus and the Eagle McLure Fire Company grounds are also in the watershed. The Lackawanna Refuse Site is also in the floodplain of the creek and the Lackawanna River. The creek flows past two superfund sites as of 1985. However, at least one was repaired in the 1980s. In Old Forge, the creek would flow out of its channel and through a low-lying area near Connell Street in the event of a 500 year flood. The designated use of Saint Johns Creek is aquatic life. History Saint Johns Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1186170. The creek is also known as Ascension Brook. This name appears in Patton's Philadelphia and Suburbs Street and Road Map, which was published in 1984. A concrete tee beam bridge was built over Saint Johns Creek in Old Forge in 1940. It is long and carries State Route 3011/Keyser Ave. A concrete slab bridge was constructed across the creek in Taylor in 1957 and repaired in 1995. It is long and carries State Route 3011. The Lehigh Valley Railroad historically passed through the creek's watershed. Saint Johns Creek experienced bank failure in flooding events in Old Forge in 1985 and 1996. The construction of an Eagle Hose Co. CSO Regulator in the vicinity of Saint Johns Creek has been planned. Greenways and connecting trails along the creek are recommended in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan. Biology The entire drainage basin of Saint Johns Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. However, it was historically designated as a Warmwater Fishery. Due to its lack of consistent flow, Saint Johns Creek is incapable of supporting any fish or aquatic wildlife. Recreation The Connells Patch Softball Complex is in the watershed of Saint Johns Creek. As of 2001, the Sibley Avenue recreation site and the Milwaukee Avenue soccer field are also under development in the watershed.

Education Morison completed a Diploma in Graphic Design from Wellington Polytechnic School of Design, Massey University in 1972. She completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts with Honours from the University of Canterbury School of Fine Arts in 1975. Career Morison was awarded the Frances Hodgkins Fellowship in 1988 and undertook the Mo√´t & Chandon contemporary art residency in Avize, France in 1990. After the year long residency she remained in France for ten years. In 1999 Morison became Senior Lecturer in Painting at the University of Canterbury, a position she held until 2007. Morison received a Laureate Award from the Arts Foundation of New Zealand in 2005. A major survey exhibition on Morison's work, A loop around a loop: Julia Morison was organised by the Christchurch Art Gallery and the Dunedin Public Art Gallery in 2006, and curated by Felicity Milburn and Justin Paton. In 2012 Morison was inducted into the Massey University College of Creative Arts' Hall of Fame. In the same year her exhibition Meet me on the other side showed at Christchurch Art Gallery and City Gallery Wellington. In 2013 her public sculpture Tree Houses for Swamp Dwellers was installed in central Christchurch as part of the SCAPE public art project. A response to the devastating Christchurch earthquakes, the work is designed to be a permanent but relocatable feature of the city. In the 2018 New Year Honours, Morison was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to visual arts. Work Avon River in Christchurch Morison's early work (from the time she finished art school) concentrated on 'severely formalist' paintings. After taking a break from exhibiting, in the mid 1980s Morison returned with a series of complex and ambitious works which became signatures in her career. Large multi-part works such as Vademecum (1986) and Golem (1987) are based on a system Morison created based on the number 10, referencing the Sefirothic Tree of Kabbalah and using ten 'logos' and ten key materials ('transparency', gold, silver, 'iridescence', lead, mercury or mercuric-oxide, clay, ash, blood, excrement), in various combinations. These systems continue to inform much of the artist's work. This system has informed a great many of her paintings and installation works, and she continues to work with replicating forms (like the Celtic knot) and organising principles (like Victorian myriorama). In 1997 Morison collaborated with fashion designer Martin Grant on Material evidence: 100-headless woman , a series of ten dresses, each three metres high and each based on a specific material, such as gold, silver, lead, excrement, blood, pearl, and clay. After the 2011 Christchurch earthquake Morison could not continue painting and instead began making sculptural works, using plaster, clay, the liquefaction sediment from the earthquake and found objects. Recently she has been working on a major new series of porcelain and stoneware ceramic head forms, called Headcases. She has currently produced about 30 works from an intended series of 100. Collections Morison's work in held in many New Zealand public gallery collections, including Christchurch Art Gallery, Auckland Art Gallery and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.

Description Melaleuca brevisepala is a shrub or small tree growing to a height of . It has a highly branched crown and the branchlets are covered with fine white hairs but become glabrous with age. The leaves have a short stalk and an elliptical shape with a blunt end, long and wide and 3 to 5 parallel veins. Yellow or greenish- yellow flowers occur on the ends of the branches and in some leaf axils near the end but the branch usually continues to grow after flowering. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower with 3 or 4 stamens per bundle. The cup-shaped base of the flower is hairy, long and the fruit which develops from it is long. Flowers and fruit are seen from December to May or June. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca buseana was first formally described in 1939 by Andr√© Guillaumin in Bulletin du Mus√©um d'Histoire Naturelle as Callistemon buseanus. It was transferred to Melaleuca buseana in 1998 by Lyndley Craven and John Dawson in the journal Adansonia. The specific epithet (buseana) refers to the locality Pic Buse in New Caledonia.

It was built in 1872 and is the oldest Lutheran church in Queensland. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Bethania Lutheran Church, the year of construction 1872 is visible, 2005 The church was built in 1872 from locally sourced handmade bricks, timber and shingles. Plaque commemorating the establishment of the congregation in 1864 It replaced an earlier slab church built in 1864 when a group of German immigrants who immigrated on the ship Susannah Godeffroy first settled in the area and gave it the name Bethanien. The graveyard next to the church has graves dating from 1866. In 1875, the railway line was built, passing close to the church and over the site of the earlier building. The shingle roof was replaced with iron in 1907 and the new pulpit was built in 1926. For the centenary celebrations in 1972 major renovations were undertaken. A new iron roof, a plywood ceiling, new lighting and leadlight windows were installed. The church, although still used, is no longer the major worship centre of the parish.  Description  Bethania Lutheran Church cemetery, 2005 1864 headstone in the cemetery (\\"gest[orben]\\" means \\"d[ied]\\") This single storey church is constructed of hand-made bricks, rendered internally and externally and has steep gable roofs sheeted with galvanised corrugated iron. The brick walls are strengthened with engaged brick piers visible externally. The exterior plaster is raked to suggest stone construction. The original timber bell tower is positioned opposite the entry doors to the church. The Beenleigh railway line runs adjacent to the property and a timber footbridge allows pedestrian access across this line. Several graves established prior to the railway line still exist in front of the church and on the other side of the line. The cemetery is now located at the rear of the church. The building consists of a rectangular double height nave with square projections at both ends. The gable roofs over the two projecting rooms are lower than the nave roof. At the eastern end is a 1972 concrete block entry vestibule that replaced a timber entry porch. It is rendered to match the rest of the building and has double entry doors located on its eastern face. The original entry doors have been removed. On the western end is a private room that contains the staircase leading to the pulpit. The pulpit located at the western end of the main space has been built as a balcony above the altar. This arrangement is original but the fabric has been reconstructed. At the eastern end of this space, over the original entry is a timber mezzanine which has been extended to twice its original size. The mezzanine is reached by a steep timber staircase. The raked ceiling has a plywood lining that replaced painted sheet metal. Two steel tie rods connect the roof structure above the wall level. The church has tall pointed arched windows in the side walls. Stained glass hopper windows replaced the original casement windows in 1972. The end walls and the attached vestibules have small pointed arched windows. The church has suffered some alterations. Fabric has been replaced but the original forms have been maintained.  Heritage listing  Bethania Lutheran Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Bethania Lutheran Church is significant for its association with the German settlers and the continuing association with the Lutheran community in the area. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Bethania Lutheran Church is significant as the oldest Lutheran Church in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. Bethania Lutheran Church shows evidence of handmade materials and rudimentary construction techniques used by the area's pioneers.

He has also worked as a comedy writer and producer. Early life and education B√∂hmermann was born and raised in Bremen. He enrolled to study history, sociology and theatre in Cologne, but dropped out before long. Previously, B√∂hmermann had applied to drama schools in Berlin, Hamburg and Munich; he was rejected by all three. He was accepted at a fourth drama school in Hannover, but did not enroll. In 1997, B√∂hmermann was hired as a columnist at the Bremen daily newspaper Die Norddeutsche. He joined Radio Bremen as a presenter in 1999, where he also had a stint as a comedy writer. In 2015, he became known internationally for the satirical music video V for Varoufakis about the Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. The clip is from B√∂hmermann's late-night show Neo Magazin Royale. His satirical rap song \\"Ich hab Polizei\\" peaked at #10 in the German charts. However, the song also caused considerable controversy: Journalists and rappers accused him of mocking lower-class people and also condoning police violence. In 2016 he and Olli Schulz hosted a talk show called Schulz & B√∂hmermann, which is based on a former show B√∂hmermann co-hosted with Charlotte Roche in 2012. Controversies B√∂hmermann in Rostock, 2014 \\"V for Varoufakis\\" video In February 2015, B√∂hmermann's late-night show Neo Magazin Royale created the song and music video \\"V for Varoufakis\\". The title references V for Vendetta, which introduced the Guy Fawkes mask as a symbol of rebellion. In addition to poking fun at Germans generally, the video explored the German fascination with Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who is regarded as articulate, physically attractive and having a stylish, if unconventional fashion sense, while also portraying Greece's dependence on German money during the Greek government-debt crisis. Unlike most content on the ZDF program Neo Magazin Royale, the song is in English and not in German. The conclusion of the video shows an actual clip of Varoufakis in which he says \\"and stick the finger to Germany, and say 'well, you can now solve this problem for yourself'. Right?\\" The clip shows Varoufakis giving the finger, a gesture called \\"Stinkefinger\\" in German. This clip had been taken out of context: Varoufakis had used a rhetorical example of what not to do. After TV host G√ºnther Jauch confronted Varoufakis with the video clip in an interview (still out of context), German news media made the issue of Varoufakis giving Germany the finger into a minor scandal. The New York Times ran an article with the title \\"German Media Want Greek Finance Minister‚Äôs Head Over ‚ÄòFingergate‚Äô\\". Varoufakis himself briefly claimed that the video must have been doctored. NZZ am Sonntag called for G√ºnther Jauch to be fired for bad journalism. In response to the claims of the middle finger being either fake or real, B√∂hmermann's Neo Magazine Royale created a false version of the video clip labelled #varoufake, which claimed to show that Varoufakis had not given the finger, and that the clip Neo Magazine Royale had used in \\"V for Varoufakis\\" was indeed a fabrication. At 8:10 in the video, B√∂hmermann says the following: This passage of the #varoufake video caused confusion, BBC interpreted it as an admittal that the video in which the finger was given was the original footage. However, this quote is more likely meant to say that the editors of G√ºnther Jauch did not edit the footage, because as explained in the rest of the video, the editors of NEO Magazine Royal edited it. The media were unclear as to which version was unmanipulated, and ZDF had to officially state that Neo Magazin Royale is satire and should not be taken at face value. Varoufakis himself praised B√∂hmermann's mockery of the German media on Twitter, writing \\"@janboehm Humour, satire & self deprecation are great solvents of blind nationalism. We politicians need you badly.\\" B√∂hmermann won a Grimme-Preis award for the manipulated finger video. Erdogan satire Twenty people lodged a complaint because of a poem named \\"Schm√§hkritik\\" (\\"abusive criticism\\") B√∂hmermann presented in his satire show Neo Magazin Royale that aired on the ZDF public channel on 31 March 2016. The proceedings instituted by the prosecutor's office for \\"insulting of organs and representatives of foreign states\\" are based on principles ¬ß103 and ¬ß104 in the German penal code. B√∂hmermann, among other things, called Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan \\"the man who beats girls\\", and said that Erdogan loved to \\"fuck goats and suppress minorities, kick Kurds, hit Christians, and watch child pornography.\\" Much of the rest of the poem is devoted to associating Erdogan with various less accepted forms of sexuality. B√∂hmermann deliberately played with the limits of satire and said several times that this form of abusive criticism was not allowed in Germany. The poem was released two weeks after the German political satire TV show extra 3 had aired a critical song about Erdogan, which led to protests of the Turkish government.Extra 3 schie√üt schon wieder gegen Erdogan, Focus, in German The ZDF channel distanced itself from the poem and cut it out of the program which can be seen in its internet archives \\"Mediathek.\\"T√ºrkei fordert Strafverfahren gegen B√∂hmermann, Die Welt, in German After a phone call with the Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu, Chancellor Angela Merkel criticised the poem as \\"intentionally hurtful\\" (\\"bewusst verletzend\\"), and prosecutors in Mainz planned to consult the federal Justice Ministry on whether to launch criminal proceedings. The Turkish government released a verbal note in which it demanded the criminal prosecution of B√∂hmermann. According to the law, the government has to approve the demand for criminal prosecution by a foreign government, before criminal proceedings can be started because of ¬ß103/104 StGB.Fall B√∂hmermann: Regierung pr√ºft T√ºrkei-Forderung , heute, in GermanSchm√§hgedicht √ºber Erdogan: Der Moderator und der Schah-Paragraf, Der Spiegel, in German Therefore Angela Merkel accepted the request from Turkey to seek his prosecution, but stressed that the acceptance was not due to the merits of the prosecution case. In addition, Erdogan himself made a complaint against B√∂hmermann as a private person because of the alleged insult. The vice minister president of Turkey, Numan Kurtulmus, called the poem a \\"serious crime against humanity\\". On 10 April the CEO of publishing house Axel Springer SE, Mathias D√∂pfner, made a plea for \\"solidarity with Jan B√∂hmermann.\\" He compared B√∂hmermann's poem to the works of Martin Kippenberger. He also referenced Michel Houellebecq's Submission and accused the German government of kowtowing to the Turks. The former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis wrote on Twitter: \\"Europe first lost its soul (agreement with Turkey on refugees), now it is losing its humour. Hands off @janboehm!\\" More than 100,000 people signed a petition for B√∂hmermann at Change.org.Schimpf oder Schande, Der Tagesspiegel, in German In a satirical letter to president Erdogan, the mayor of T√ºbingen, Boris Palmer (Alliance 90/The Greens), assured Erdogan his \\"solidarity\\" and demanded the extradition of B√∂hmermann to Turkey. \\"Cut off B√∂hmermann's testicles, so he never makes fun of presidents with a short dick again\\", he wrote. The letter is signed \\"most respectfully, Boris Palmer\\".Palmer macht sich f√ºr Auslieferung B√∂hmermanns stark, Die Welt, in German A YouGov poll revealed on 12 April, that a majority of the Germans supported B√∂hmermanns position. 48 percent of the pollees found the poem appropriate, 29 percent view it as undue. A great majority (66 percent) opposed the deletion of the poem on the ZDF website as well as Merkel's criticism of the poem as \\"intentionally hurtful\\" (68 percent). Only 15% support a criminal investigation, with 77% against. On 12 April it was reported that B√∂hmermann was under police protection, because he was threatened by supporters of Erdogan. The filming of the upcoming edition of Neo Magazin Royale was cancelled due to \\"massive media reporting and the focus on the programme and the presenter\\". B√∂hmermann had also cancelled his radio show Sanft & Sorgf√§ltig on Sunday and his appearance at the Grimme Awards, where he was awarded for his Varoufakis video. In October 2016, the prosecutors dropped the case, saying they had not found sufficient evidence to continue the inquiry against Jan Boehmermann. The rarely used paragraph 103 of Germany's penal code, which criminalizes insults against foreign heads of state, under which B√∂hmermann was indicted, was subsequently abolished in 2018.https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article172081058/103-StGB- Deutschland-schafft-die-Majestaetsbeleidigung-endgueltig-ab.html Works Radio * 1999‚Äì2004: Radio Bremen * 2009‚Äì2011: Die ganz gro√üe Jan B√∂hmermann Radioschau * 2010‚Äì2013: Lateline * 2011‚Äì2012: Zwei alte Hasen erz√§hlen von fr√ºher, with Klaas Heufer-Umlauf * 2012: Joko und Klaas mit Olli und Jan, with Olli Schulz * 2012‚Äì2016: Sanft & Sorgf√§ltig, with Olli Schulz Podcast * 2012 - 2016 Sanft & Sorgf√§ltig , with Olli Schulz * since 2016: Fest & Flauschig (Spotify), with Olli Schulz Television * 2007: Echt B√∂hmermann (WDR Fernsehen) * 2009: TV Helden (RTL) * 2012: Roche & B√∂hmermann (ZDFkultur), with Charlotte Roche * 2012‚Äì2013: Lateline (EinsPlus) * 2013‚Äì2014: Neo Magazin (ZDFneo) * 2014: Was w√§re, wenn?

She traveled widely to places including Austria, France, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland and Venice. Noted works include: Ancient Cedars at Ankerwycke, Staines, Moonlight at Chiavenna and The Diligence Halting. She exhibited both in Britain and abroad, including at the Royal Academy between 1864 and 1903. She exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts and The Woman's Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Her painting Isola Bella Lago Maggiore was included in the 1905 book Women Painters of the World..Women painters of the world, from the time of Caterina Vigri, 1413-1463, to Rosa Bonheur and the present day, by Walter Shaw Sparrow, The Art and Life Library, Hodder & Stoughton, 27 Paternoster Row, London, 1905 In 1886, Marrable was elected as the first President of the Society of Lady Artists (SLA), formerly the Society of Female Artists (SFA) and since 1899 is now known as the Society of Women Artists (SWA), she retired from the presidency in 1912. Isola Bella Lago Maggiore Biography Madeline Cockburn was born in London on 20 July 1833. The daughter of James Cockburn an officer in the 17th Lancers (bborn 1790/91) and his wife, Madeline Susan, n√©e Dunlop (1792/3‚Äì1876) who was one of the Dunlop‚Äôs of Dunlop an old Ayrshire family. On the death of his wife James Cockburn left the army and became a merchant. Her uncle, Ralph Cockburn was a painter and the first custodian of the Dulwich Picture Gallery. Her great grandmother was Robert Burns' first patron and her portrait formed the frontispiece to his early works. On 2 September 1856, she married the well- known architect Frederick Marrable with whom she had two children, a boy and a girl. After her husband died suddenly in 1872, Madeline Marrable supported her family through selling her works. She died on 26 April 1916 at 30 Porchester Square, Hyde Park, London. Her daughter, Edith Ferguson, also became a professional watercolour artist, exhibiting at the SWA, as well as elsewhere. Career Madeline Marrable was a prolific London based artist known primarily for her landscape paintings in oil and watercolours. She studied under Henry Warren, a past President of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours and oil painting at Queen Square School (later, Female School of Art) in Bloomsbury under Peter Graham. In 1864, she was encouraged by Charles Landseer to exhibit at the Royal Academy. Marrable exhibited with London art societies, regionally, abroad and with the Royal Academy in 1864 showing Study of trees and then in 1871, 1872, 1878, 1883, 1889, 1900 and finally in 1903 showing two watercolours ‚Äì Pergola, Lago di Garda and Tramontana Wind, Bordighera.

The band released several singles, and an album to reach regional acclaim before disbanding in 1970. Their later works spanned across multiple genres, including early examples of proto-punk. The band was known for playing among other highly successful acts, and incorporating their influences into the group's own individual sound. History The Bittersweets In 1966, the first incarnation of the band formed as the Bittersweets. As the Bittersweets, a predominately folk rock group, the majority of the band members were just starting their professional music career, as they began at the local club circuit. The band hired a woman named Chari Zelman to be their manager. Zelman was able to effectively find gigs for the band, and allowed them to have practice sessions at her own establishment. The band opened for acts like Blue Cheer, Canned Heat, and, more importantly, The Byrds who were the most influential on the band. The band was able to assemble a local audience, and found their first producer, local DJ Tony Evans. Evans worked to get the band signed to record deals on small labels. In all, the band produced three singles all on individual labels that resembled closely to what material The Byrds were developing at the time. Once the last of the singles were produced, the band decided to relocate to Los Angeles, and, upon being informed another band was going by the same name, the group changed their name. By the suggestion of an audience member in one of the band's gigs, the band became known as the Twentieth Century Zoo in mid-1967. Twentieth Century Zoo The band, under their new name, released two more singles that were regional successes, and garnered enough interest from Vault Records to sign them to their major label. Recording took place in AT Audio Recorders for the small Caz label. The singles marked a shift in the band's past sound into the more psychedelic and acid driven genres. The second of those singles, \\"You Don't Remember\\", is described as an early example of protopunk, although in this period of the band they were recordings a diversity of musical styles. Their sound was a combination of vocal harmonies, complex fuzz guitar solos, and other aspects of the Los Angeles music scene, most notably in their live performances. The band toured in the Southwest of the U.S., opening to more national acts. The band also appeared on television in several shows including The Wallace and Ladmo Show. Following the band's added exposure, they began recording for their debut album in late 1968. Album development began at Vault Records Studios in Hollywood, and featured tracks similar to Fever Tree. Along those lines, the standouts on the album were the prolonged guitar solos on the longer tracks. Eastern-influenced string and percussion instrumentals were utilized and assorted sound effects magnified the melodies of the compositions. In early 1969, the album, Thunder on a Clear Day, was issued on the Vault label to more regional success for the band, but failing to chart nationally. After another tour, the band partially completed songs intended for a second album, but the lead guitarist \\"Skip\\" Ladd was drafted into the Army. A brief attempt to find a replacement failed, and after one last single the band disbanded in early 1970. In 1999, Sundazed Records re-issued the band's album and an EP compiling three unreleased tracks originally designated for the second album release.

Soon after the release of this album, the group collaborated with Pomplamoose to release a single, \\"It Goes On.\\" Sporting the group's distinctive electro-funk sound, the single brought increased visibility to the duo. \\"Let Go\\", Knower's third album, was released in 2013. They followed the release of \\"Let Go\\" with a performance at Bonnaroo Festival with Soul Khan, Jenny Suk, and Black Violin. Knower also went on a tour of the east coast United States with duo WeYou, consisting of Nate Wood and Jesske Hume. In 2014, Knower released the non- album single \\"I Must Be Dreaming\\", and toured the East Coast and the South. They were also presented by Quincy Jones in a new artist concert series in Los Angeles. Their song \\"Fuck the Makeup, Skip the Shower\\" was featured on FlyLo FM on the next-gen version of Grand Theft Auto V. In 2015, Knower recorded with Snarky Puppy on their Family Dinner ‚Äì Volume 2. In 2016 they formed a 5-piece live band as an alternative lineup. Apart from the core members, the band at various points included Tim Lefebvre, Dennis Hamm, Sam Wilkes, Sam Gendel, Nate Wood and Jonah Nilsson. Their European tour of 2016, as well as parts of the US tour, featured the live band. In July 2017, Knower opened for the Red Hot Chili Peppers in four major European cities. In 2018, Knower toured Europe, China, Japan, and the US, continuing the live band formation and also unveiling a renovated duo set with Artadi and Cole. In 2019, Knower expanded their touring to South Africa and South America, including Rapa Nui. Since 2017, Knower has performed in multiple European cities with the Swedish big band . Cole and Gendel have been suspected to be behind the surrealist grindcore-influenced formation Clown Core.

His name, \\"Magnes\\", the Latin word for magnetite, has been attributed as the origin of the Latin root that has passed into English, giving its speakers the words magnet, magnetism, the mentioned ore, and related formulations. Other authorities have attributed the word origin to other sources. As set out in Pliny's Naturalis Historia (\\"Natural History\\"), an early encyclopedia published c. 77 CE ‚Äì c. 79 CE, and as translated from the Latin in Robert Jacobus Forbes' Studies in Ancient Technology, Pliny wrote the following (attributing the source of his information, in turn, to Nicander of Colophon): > Nicander is our authority that it [magnetite ore] was called Magnes from the > man who first discovered it on Mount Ida and he is said to have found it > when the nails of his shoes and the ferrule of his staff adhered to it, as > he was pasturing his herds. The passage appears at Book XXXVI of Naturalis Historia, covering \\"The Natural History of Stones\\", at chapter 25 entitled \\"The Magnet: Three Remedies\\". Although Pliny's description is often cited, the story of Magnes the shepherd is postulated by physicist Gillian Turner to be much older, dating from approximately 900 BCE. Any writings Nicander may have made on the subject have since been lost. Written in approximately 600 CE, book XVI of Etymologiae by Isidore of Seville tells the same story as Pliny, but places Magnes in India. This is repeated in Vincent of Beauvais' Miroir du Monde (c. 1250 CE) and in Thomas Nicols' 1652 work, Lapidary, or, the History of Pretious Stones, wherein he describes Magnes as a \\"shepherd of India, who was wont to keep his flocks about those mountains in India, where there was an abundance of lodestones\\". Following from Pliny's account, the shepherd's name has been often cited as giving rise to the Latin root word and etymological source of the English word for magnet and the coterie of its related word forms such as magnetite, magnet, magnetism, magnesium, manganese and others. Other authorities, including the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius (c. 99 BCE ‚Äì c. 55 BCE), have attributed the etymology of magnet, and progeny, to the name of the Lydian city, Magnesia ad Sipylum (Manisa, Turkey in modern times), where magnetic ore may have first been discovered or recognized. Other ancient locations have been attributed as the origin, including the Greek province Thracian Magnesia, and the Ionian city of Magnesia ad Maeandrum. The idea that the legend of Magnes the shepherd could be the origin of magnet, et al., and the legend itself has been criticized. Pliny's story is characterized in Gillian Turner's book North Pole, South Pole: The Epic Quest to Solve the Great Mystery of Earth‚Äôs Magnetism (2011) as \\"no doubt embellished by centuries of retelling.\\" In the 1896 treatise Coil and Current; or the Triumphs of Electricity, the authors write: > 'Magnet' is derived from the legend of Magnes, or from the territory of > Magnesia. Pliny states that Magnes, the shepherd, discovered it, and the > legend told of him is that while carrying a message over Mount Ida he felt > his feet clinging to the earth, to the iron ore which lay thickly upon the > hill. Hence the name of the Magnet. But Magnesia was a territory whence this > native iron was for hundreds of years exported, and the name \\"Magnet\\" is, no > doubt, due to this place.

The sculpture was first installed in Grosvenor Gardens in the City of Westminster in April 2013, as part of the City of Sculpture initiative. In September 2015 it was moved to the National Trust property of Mottisfont in Hampshire. The work is executed in glass reinforced plastic with a bronze powder coat. It was scaled up from a much smaller maquette and incorporates hugely enlarged versions of the artist's fingerprints as well as his own graffiti. It was inspired in part by Breuer-Weil's grandfather Ernst, who fled to England after the Nazi takeover of Austria in 1938 but subsequently found himself labelled an \\"enemy alien\\".\\"Sculpture inspired by refugee grandfather\\".

The sculpture also incorporates a portrait of the fictional Kaiser of Nerac, a character who rules an imaginary world conceived of by Breuer-Weil as a source of inspiration for his artworks.

S., Rawlin, V. K., and Patterson, M. J.: \\"Ion Propulsion Development Projects in U.

It is a highly efficient low-thrust spacecraft propulsion running on electrical power generated by solar arrays. It uses high-voltage electrodes to accelerate ions with electrostatic forces. Development and performance Diagram of an electrostatic ion thruster The purpose of NSTAR program was to develop a xenon-fueled ion propulsion system for deep space missions. The NSTAR electrostatic ion thruster was developed at NASA's Glenn Research Center and manufactured by Hughes, and Spectrum Astro, Inc. in the early 1990s. The feed system development was a collaborative effort between JPL and Moog Inc. The ions are accelerated through two fine grids with roughly a 1300 V difference between them for 2.3 kW operation, with a thrust of 20-92 mN, a specific impulse of 19000-30500 N¬∑s/kg (1950-3100 s) and a total impulse capability of 2.65 x106 Ns. In 1996, the prototype engine endured 8000 hours of continuous operation in a vacuum chamber that simulates conditions of outer space. The results of the prototyping were used to define the design of flight hardware that was built for Deep Space 1 probe. One of the challenges was developing a compact and light weight power processing unit that converts power from the solar arrays into the voltages needed by the engine. The engine achieves a specific impulse of one to three thousand seconds. This is an order of magnitude higher than traditional space propulsion methods, resulting in a mass savings of approximately half. This leads to much lighter and less expensive launch vehicles. Although the engine produces just 92 millinewtons (0.331 ounce-force) thrust at maximum power (2,100W on DS1 mission), the craft achieved high speed because ion engines thrust continuously for long periods of time. Applications The NSTAR ion thruster was first used on the Deep Space 1 (DS1) spacecraft, launched on 24 October 1998.NASA Glenn Contributions to Deep Space 1 The Deep Space mission carried out a flyby of asteroid 9969 Braille and Comet Borrelly. It produced 2.3 kW and was the primary propulsion for the probe.

Early life, education, and ordination Walmsley was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts on May 4, 1928. He attended Trinity College in Hartford. Graduating cum laude from the Episcopal Theological School in 1951, he was ordained a deacon that year, and priest in 1952 by the Rt. Rev. Arthur Lichtenberger, then of Missouri. Following his ordination, he served inner city churches in St. Louis for the next seven years. In 1958, he moved to the staff of the national Executive Council of the Episcopal Church as executive of the Division of Christian Citizenship, and later as Assistant Director of the Department of Social Relations, and Episcopal staff member of the National Council of Churches Commission on Religion and Race during the turbulent decade of the 1960s. He later resigned staff functions when the General Convention Special Program was adopted favoring black leadership. He has the distinction of having been one of the architects of the Episcopal Society for Cultural and Racial Unity and the National Conference on Religion and Race. Subsequently, Walmsley served as priest-in-charge at Grace Church, Amherst, and Director of the Massachusetts Council of Churches, where he pioneered work in industrial mission, ecumenical dialogue, and inter-seminary cooperation.

He devoted himself in particular to the church's mission in a rapidly changing society, serving inner-city parishes and supporting a range of social ministries, including Episcopal Social Services, Integrated Refugee Ministries, Urban Bishops‚Äô Coalition and pioneer work to HIV-AIDs sufferers. An abiding interest is the relationship of race and the Episcopal Church and the role of the Church in the civil rights movement. For a decade, he worked as a staff aide to three Presiding Bishops, and gave oversight to the church's social witness during the civil rights and Vietnam War struggles of the 1960s. In one capacity or another, he played an active role in other defining issues faced by the Episcopal Church - the revision of the Book of Common Prayer, the ordination of women, the selection of the first woman bishop. As Bishop of Connecticut from 1979 to 1993, he was chairman of the Council of Advice to Presiding Bishop Edmund Browning in emerging conflicts over the church's response to its gay and lesbian members. He was a member of the which ruled on the possible trial of Bishop Walter Righter in the ordination of a gay man. He has helped craft the Episcopal Church's response to the Millennium Development Goals as a defining thrust of global reconciliation in the missio dei, 1 He is a founding member of the Episcopal Partnership for Global Mission, later organized as Episcopalians for Global Reconciliation, 2005. Publications His publications include The Church in a Society of Abundance (Seabury Press, 1963); numerous periodical contributions and papers; and the editorship of the daily General Convention newspaper, Issues, in 1970, 1973, and 1976. He coordinated the Anglican Symposium on Mission Theology in 1984. He served on the board of trustees for General Theological Seminary and Berkeley Divinity School at Yale, and his achievements were recognized with several honorary diplomas.

Plot  Every Last Child shows the steps taken in Pakistan to eliminate poliomyelitis (polio) infection from the country. Polio, which had almost been eradicated from the world, showed resurgence in Pakistan after the Taliban banned polio vaccinations. The film also shows the efforts made by health care workers, who, in spite of difficulties while doing their work such as violence and politics, attempted to save Pakistani children from polio. The first scene in Every Last Child is of a fully armed army unit being told by its captain to get ready for war, but in this case the war is to give protection against the Taliban who are obstructing the polio vaccinators from immunizing children. Polio victims are then profiled: In one scene, a destitute person affected by polio and pushing a dilapidated cart says \\"I'll be fit in the afterlife\\"; in another scene, a polio-affected child is getting fitted with braces, with his distressed father watching; in yet another scene a lady whose two family members were killed by the Taliban when they were canvassing for vaccination is actively supporting the cause of vaccination. There are also scenes of false propaganda made against the vaccinations stating perceived ill effects of the polio vaccine such as making \\"girls prematurely adult and boys impotent.\\" The propaganda also attributes the vaccine as a plot of Jews and Christians with intent to eliminate Muslims. The film ends on a positive note, with a scene showing documents related to the success of the vaccination programme under the title \\"Justice for Health\\", a programme initiated by Imran Khan. Production Every Last Child is a production by Image Nation Abu Dhabi FZ, directed by Tom Roberts who was also the script writer. Roberts was also the producer of the film, along with Anna Melin and Sabin Agha. Ali Faisal Zaidi was the Director of Photography and editing and composing was done by Paul Carlin.

It was built from 1877 to 1977. It is also known as Gramzow Provisional School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former Carbrook State School, now a high-set timber and iron building, was originally named Gramzow Provisional School when constructed in 1877. The area around Carbrook was originally called the Logan District after Captain Patrick Logan who discovered the Logan River in 1826. The area was logged by timber getters before selectors began arriving in the 1860s. The first selector in the area was Herman Meissner who took up his selection in April 1868. The mainly German immigrants who settled in the Carbrook area named the settlement Gramzow after the town Gramzow in Germany, and followed agricultural pursuits including the growing and milling of sugar cane and arrowroot. Later, the area supported dairying which gave way to bananas and a variety of small crops. In 1876, farmers John Sommer, Charles Habermann, August Fischer and James Graham, formed a committee representing the community and requested the Department of Public Instruction to establish a State School at Gramzow. The request was refused as there were insufficient student numbers to justify the establishment of a State School, but the Department suggested that the best way will be to begin with a Provisional School at Gramzow, and when the attendance exceeds thirty, a residence can be added. A Provisional School was described as being one in which temporary provision is made for the primary instruction of children and not being a State school. These schools were established where an average attendance of between 12 and 30 pupils could be maintained and where the local promoters could provide a suitable building at their own expense. These buildings could be built on private land, Crown land or on land vested in the Minister. When the average attendance of the school rose to more than 30, the school committee was expected to raise the requisite one-fifth local contribution towards the cost of a State school. In March 1876, farmers August Fischer and Herman Meissner each sold two acres of land, creating a four-acre school site, to the Department of Public Instruction for the nominal price of five shillings each (registered in May 1876). The land had been alienated from the crown in 1868, with Fischer obtaining and Meissner obtaining . Tenders for construction were called in March 1877. The school building cost , with the residents subscribing ( cash and value of the land), and the Gramzow Provisional School opened on 5 November 1877 with 23 pupils enrolled in the December quarter. Tenders were called for the teacher's residence in August 1878. The teacher's residence was completed on 17 January 1879 (no longer extant), the school became a State School on 20 January 1879, and was first inspected on 7 June 1879 at which time there were 33 pupils enrolled.  The School  The school building was built on low timber stumps with a timber shingled roof, unlined weatherboard walls and without a verandah. The building was set back from the road towards the rear of the lightly timbered site, as this was the highest position within the low-lying land, which was described as being very flat and boggy in wet weather. A verandah was added to the north side of the school building in 1889, with either end enclosed as a hat room and lavatory. The first Arbor Day was held in 1892, and between 1892-96 a gateway was erected and later, driveway trees were planted. In 1908 the school building was roofed with corrugated iron. Children of German families from Gramzow walked to Alberton (formerly Elkana) every Thursday to attend the German School to learn German. The school was located near St Peter's Lutheran Church where services were conducted in German until the First World War. In 1916 Gramzow was changed to Carbrook, and in November of that year the Department of Public Instruction approved the change of name of the School to Carbrook State School. The war created anti-German sentiment and the use of the German language was extremely unpopular. During the early 1920s there was much controversy between parents and teachers at the school, for a number of reasons. Various reports were conducted, with an October 1930 report by the District Inspector concluding that \\"from the open way in which parents and children talked, I feel that modesty is not one of the virtues of Carbrook\\". The school experimented with growing cotton in the school garden, but in April 1923 it was reported that the experiment was unsuccessful as the soil was poor and swampy. The school building was raised onto high stumps in 1932, and the interior walls were lined with vertical boarding. Later that year the rear and sides of the underfloor area was enclosed with corrugated iron. In September 1936 electricity was connected to the teacher's residence and school building, and a ceiling was installed in the school building in May 1940. To increase light and ventilation, plans had been prepared in May 1941 for the replacement of the east windows of the school building, but it was not until August 1949 that approval was given for the removal of the east sash windows and their replacement with casement windows with fanlights and window hood. The southeast sash window was also removed and walled over. A six-foot fence was erected between the school and the teacher's residence in May 1952, replacing an earlier timber paling fence. In August 1954 approval was given for asphalting the underfloor area of the school building, which consisted of fine dust and dirt. Due to the removal of the teacher's residence in 1955, the electricity connection was rearranged, as both meters for the school building and teacher's residence were located on the verandah of the residence. In March 1956, the internal painting of the school building was approved, and prior to this the interior wall lining and ceiling had been unpainted. In June 1956 gravel filling was provided for the driveway, parade area and around the school. In June 1960 two new lights were installed to replace the original single light. In February 1961 the Head Teacher was anxious to start a forestry plot, which was in existence by 1964 and eventually held 375 pine trees. By June 1963 the northeast end of the verandah had been enclosed to form a library. Student numbers gradually declined (only 16 students in 1974) until 1976, when a significant increase in enrolments necessitated an expansion of facilities at the school. At this time, the school had an extremely high rate of student turnover, and the major source of students was claimed to be the nearby Aquatic Gardens Caravan Park and a Revival Centre. The school celebrated its centenary in 1977, and a time capsule was buried to the northwest of the school building on 1 October 1977. The school building was restumped with concrete and steel posts, corrugated iron sheeting around the underfloor area was replaced with weatherboard and louvres, and the school was carpeted and repainted. At this time, a demountable classroom (no longer extant) was installed to the northeast of the school building, and an adventure playground was constructed to the west in 1978. From this time, consideration was given to increasing the school grounds but negotiations with neighbouring landholders were not successful. By 1979, the alternative of a replacement school site was being investigated. In March 1982, a second demountable building (no longer extant) was installed to the east of the school building to be used for classrooms. The original school building was then used as a library, with a staff room on the verandah. Due to drainage problems on the original school site, it was decided in 1983 to procure a replacement school site. A number of sites were investigated, with the chosen site being located to the west of the school along Beenleigh-Redland Bay Road. Negotiations for the purchase of the site were not successful, and in 1985 the site was recommended to be resumed. Stage one of the replacement school was completed in January 1987, and it opened for the new school year. The official opening of the replacement school was not held until 14 May 1988. For a number of years the former Carbrook State School remained vacant. A plan to use the site as a Special Education Facility was investigated for a number of years, but was finally abandoned. The removal of a demountable building was approved in January 1993, and the site was approved for disposal from the Education Department in September 1993. Since then, the Old Carbrook School has been cared for by Logan City Council and provided to various organisations that provide community services in Logan. In 2013, Shaftesbury Centre established an animal-assisted learning program for children in care. In June 2017, the program was handed over to Equine Learning & Life Adventures Ltd, who today continue the program.  The Teacher's Residence  The teacher's residence, completed in 1879, was constructed to the east of the school building and was built on low timber stumps with a timber shingled roof. The first Head Teacher, Horace Heywood, arrived from England in September 1877 and awaited a teacher's residence to be built before he asked his wife and family to join him. No accommodation was made available for him when he arrived, and he was forced to live with two bachelor brothers in filth and confusion ineffable in a small room which swarmed with fleas and bugs that bit me every night. During the Christmas holidays he lived in the school building, at which time the school committee erected a slab humpy, without a floor, and having very small windows. He had to cook on an open air fire, and as the building stood near swampy ground and leaked badly in wet weather his books were spoilt and bedclothing mildewed. These problems were alleviated with the completion of the teacher's residence in January 1879, which consisted of an L-shaped plan with a kitchen and small verandah at the rear and three main rooms with a verandah at the front. This was later enlarged with the addition of a room at the rear, forming a U-shaped plan with a verandah between, in 1908. In September 1936 electricity was connected, and in May 1940 a ceiling was installed in the living room of the teacher's residence. In 1954 the residence was severely damaged by a cyclone, and was reported as having been condemned for 17 years. In February 1955, authorisation was given for the residence to be removed, and it was sold to Heindrich Gottfried Berndt of Woongoolba for .  Description  The former Carbrook State School building is a high-set timber structure located towards the rear of a large level site and is approached via an avenue of trees leading from Beenleigh-Redland Bay Road to the north. The building has weatherboard cladding, a corrugated iron gable roof, and is supported by steel and concrete posts. A verandah is located on the north, with a corrugated iron skillion roof, central timber stair, timber posts and timber rail balustrade. Either end of the verandah was enclosed early to form two small rooms, with the northeast room being later extended to the central stair. The building has a central double timber door with glazed fanlight to the verandah, with narrow, paired timber sash windows to either side. The rear of the building has a central double timber door accessed via a timber stair with a timber and iron awning, with a narrow paired sash window to the west, and the former east window having been closed over with weatherboard. The gable ends originally had three narrow sash windows, evidence of which can be seen in weatherboard infill, but the west gable now has a triple panel of glass louvres and the east has four sets of paired casements with a timber and iron window hood. Each gable has a high level opening which has been closed over. Internally, the building consists of one large room, with two enclosed rooms on the verandah. Walls have vertically jointed boarding, with boarded ceilings raked to collar beam height, and security bars have been fixed over windows. The northwest verandah room has unlined single-skin walls, a paired casement window, a timber door to the verandah and a doorway which has been cut into the internal wall. The northeast verandah room is larger, and has access to the verandah, but not the main room. The sub-floor space has a concrete floor and has been partially enclosed with weatherboard and glass louvres to the rear. A storage room is located in the southwest corner, and has been enclosed with vertically jointed boarding and weatherboard. The building has three corrugated iron rainwater tanks, and a flag pole to the northwest. Two fig trees are located to the north of the building flanking the central driveway, which is lined by an avenue of trees of various species. A weatherboard toilet block with a skillion roof is located to the south of the building at the rear boundary. Pine trees line the road frontage and the east boundary, and the former playing field is located to the northeast.  Heritage listing  The former Carbrook State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Carbrook State School, which opened as Gramzow Provisional School in 1877, functioned for 110 years and reflects the development of, and changes in, Primary Education in Queensland. The building is one of the earliest structures in the area, and as a public building the school is a record of the development of the Carbrook area and the growth of, and changes to, the Carbrook community. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The former school, with its tree lined driveway and original school building located towards the rear of the site, makes a valuable contribution to the Carbrook landscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The former school has strong associations with the early German settlers of the district, which is reflected in the importance the current community attaches to the site.

Although the precise origins are unknown, a mortuary tradition of domes existed across the ancient world, as well as a symbolic association with the sky. Both of these traditions may have a common root in the use of the domed hut, a shape which was translated into tombs and associated with the heavens. The mortuary tradition has been expressed in domed mausoleums, martyriums, and baptisteries. The celestial symbolism was adopted by rulers in the Middle East to emphasize their divine legitimacy and was inherited by later civilizations down to the present day as a general symbol of governmental authority. Origins The meaning of the dome has been extensively analyzed by architectural historians. According to Nicola Camerlenghi, it may not be possible to arrive at a single \\"fixed meaning and universal significance\\" for domes across all building types and locations throughout history, since the shape, function, and context for individual buildings were determined locally, even if inspired by distant predecessors, and meaning could change over time. Mortuary tradition According to E. Baldwin Smith, from the late Stone Age the dome-shaped tomb was used as a reproduction of the ancestral, god- given shelter made permanent as a venerated home of the dead. The instinctive desire to do this resulted in widespread domical mortuary traditions across the ancient world, from the stupas of India to the tholos tombs of Iberia. The Scythians built such domed tombs, as did some Germanic tribes in a paraboloid shape. By Hellenistic and Roman times, the domical tholos had become the customary cemetery symbol. Lukas Nickel writes that the conception of a round heaven over a square earth may have contributed to the Han Chinese' rapid adoption in the first century AD of square base cloister vault chambers in their tomb architecture. Celestial tradition Smith writes that in the process of transforming the hut shape from its original pliable materials into more difficult stone construction, the dome had also become associated with celestial and cosmic significance, as evident from decoration such as stars and celestial chariots on the ceilings of domed tombs. This cosmological thinking was not limited to domed ceilings, being part of a symbolic association between any house, tomb, or sanctuary and the universe as a whole, but it popularized the use of the domical shape. Michele Melaragno writes that the nomadic tribes of central Asia are the origin of a symbolic tradition of round domed-tents being associated with the sky and heavens that eventually spread to the Middle East and the Mediterranean. Rudolf Wittkower writes that a \\"cosmic interpretation of the dome remained common well into the eighteenth century.\\" =Divine ruler= Herbert Howe writes that throughout the Middle East domes were symbolic of \\"the tent of the ruler, and especially of the god who dwells in the tent of the heavens.\\" Passages in the Old Testament and intertestamental literature document this, such as Psalms 123:1, Isaiah 40:22, I Kings 8:30, Isaiah 66:1, Psalms 19:4, and Job 22:14. Domes and tent-canopies were also associated with the heavens in Ancient Persia and the Hellenistic- Roman world. A dome over a square base reflected the geometric symbolism of those shapes. The circle represented perfection, eternity, and the heavens. The square represented the earth. An octagon was intermediate between the two. According to Michael Walter, a tradition of the \\"golden dome\\" identifying the ruler with the cosmos, sun, and astrological values originated in Persia and spread to later Roman and Turkic courts. Persian kings used domed tents in their official audiences to symbolize their divinity, and this practice was adopted by Alexander the Great. According to Smith, the distinct symbolism of the heavenly or cosmic tent stemming from the royal audience tents of Achaemenid and Indian rulers was adopted by Roman rulers in imitation of Alexander, becoming the imperial baldachin. This probably began with Nero, whose Domus Aurea, meaning \\"Golden House\\", also made the dome a feature of Roman palace architecture. Michele Melaragno writes that the allegory of Alexander the Great's domical tent in Roman imperial architecture coincided with the \\"divinification\\" of Roman emperors and served as a symbol of this. According to Nicholas Temple, Nero's octagonal domed room in his Domus Aurea was an early example of an imperial reception hall, the symbolism of which \\"signaled an elevation of the status of the emperor as living deity, which in the case of Nero related specifically to his incarnation as Helios and the Persian Mithra.\\" The semi-domed apse became a symbol of Roman imperial authority under Domitian and depictions into the Byzantine period used overhead domes or semidomes to identify emperors. Karl Swoboda writes that even by the time of Diocletian, the dome probably symbolized sovereignty over the whole world. Roman imperial reception halls or throne rooms were often domed with circular or octagonal plans and, according to Nicholas Temple, \\"functioned as a ceremonial space between the emperor, his court and the gods\\", becoming a common feature of imperial palaces from the time of Constantine onwards. Christianity E. Baldwin Smith writes that the Christian use of domes acknowledged earlier symbolic associations. By the Christian era, \\"cosmic imagery had come to transcend the mortuary, divine and royal symbolism already associated with the dome.\\" Thomas Mathews writes that Christianity's rejection of astrology was reflected in the omission of signs of the zodiac imagery from their dome decoration. Martyriums The dual sepulchral and heavenly symbolism was adopted by early Christians in both the use of domes in architecture and in the ciborium, a domical canopy like the baldachin used as a ritual covering for relics or the church altar. The traditional mortuary symbolism led the dome to be used in Christian central- type martyriums in the Syrian area, the growing popularity of which spread the form. The spread and popularity of the cult of relics also transformed the domed central-type martyriums into the domed churches of mainstream Christianity. The use of centralized buildings for the burials of heroes was common by the time the Anastasis Rotunda was built in Jerusalem, but the use of centralized domed buildings to symbolize resurrection was a Christian innovation. Baptisteries Richard Krautheimer notes that the octagonal pattern of Roman mausolea corresponded to the Christian idea of the number eight symbolizing spiritual regeneration. In Italy in the 4th century, baptisteries began to be built like domed mausoleums and martyriums, which spread in the 5th century. This reinforced the theological emphasis on baptism as a re-experience of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The octagon, which is transitional between the circle and the square, came to represent Jesus' resurrection in early Christianity and was used in the ground plans of martyriums and baptisteries for that reason. The domes themselves were sometimes octagonal, rather than circular. Nicholas Temple proposes the imperial reception hall as an additional source of influence on baptisteries, conveying the idea of reception or redemptive passage to salvation. Iconography of assembled figures and the throne of Christ would also relate to this. Throne halls Michele Melaragno writes that the concept of \\"Christ the King\\" was the Christian counterpoint to the Roman tradition of emperor deification and so absorbed the dome symbolism associated with it. Like the throne room of the Eastern Roman emperor, or Chrysotriklinos, Charlemagne's throne in the Palatine Chapel at Aachen was located in a domed octagonal space. In the words of Allan George Doig, the throne at Aachen was located in \\"an intermediary place between earth and heaven\\" on the gallery level, directly across from an image of Christ's throne on the dome. According to Herbert Schutz, the symbolism of the octagon at Aachen related to the emperor's role as God's representative on Earth in achieving a universal \\"Imperium Christianum\\" and the geometry of objects and architecture acted as a \\"wordless text\\" to suggest ideas, such as the \\"renovatio imperii\\". Churches Literary evidence exists that the idea of the cosmic temple had been applied to the Christian basilica by the end of the 4th century, in the form of a speech by Eusebius on a church in Tyre. However, it is only in the mid 6th century that the earliest literary evidence of a cosmological interpretation of a domed church building exists, in a hymn composed for the cathedral church of Edessa. Kathleen E. McVey traces this to a blending by Jacob of Serugh of the two major but contradictory schools of biblical exegesis at the time: the building-as-microcosm tradition of the Antioch school combined with the Alexandrian view of the cosmos and firmament as composed of spheres and hemispheres, which was rejected by the Antioch school. Gold was used as the color of Heaven, and Charles Stewart notes that the emphasis on light from windows beneath the domes of Justinian's imperial commissions corresponds to the Neo-Platonist idea of light as a symbol of wisdom. Andrzej Piotrowski writes that Byzantine churches after Justinian's Hagia Sophia often had gold-covered domes with a ring of windows and that gold, as \\"the most precious metal and the paradigm of purity, was a sign of light and divinity in the writings of St. Basil and Pseudo-Dionysius. It 'does not rust, decompose, or wear and can be beaten to the fineness of air. Gold was used to invoke the transcendental nature of the Incarnate Christ.'\\" Beginning in the late eighth century, portraits of Christ began to replace gold crosses at the centers of church domes, which Charles Stewart suggests may have been an over-correction in favor of images after the periods of Iconoclasm in the eighth and ninth centuries. One of the first was on the nave dome of Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki, and this eventually developed into the bust image known as the Pantokrator. Otto Demus writes that Middle Byzantine churches were decorated in a systematic manner and can be seen as having three zones of decoration, with the holiest at the top. This uppermost zone contained the dome, drum and apse. The dome was reserved for the Pantokrator (meaning \\"ruler of all\\"), the drum usually contained images of angels or prophets, and the apse semi-dome usually depicted the Virgin Mary, typically holding the Christ Child and flanked by angels. Anna Freze writes that the octagonal churches and octagon domed churches of the Byzantine Empire during the 9th to 11th centuries were closely linked to imperial commissions. The octagonal patterns were mean to convey \\"the idea of basilea as the sacral power and status of a Byzantine emperor\\" and the octagon, also being a symbol of regeneration, suggests an origin for this in the architectural restorations of Basil I following the iconoclast periods. Nicola Camerlenghi writes that domes were status symbols among the competing cities and communes of medieval Italy and this contributed to the boom in dome construction there beginning in the 11th century. Rudolf Wittkower writes that many centralized domed churches dedicated to the Virgin Mary were meant to evoke the shape of a crown and her status as Queen of Heaven. Renaissance and Reformation =Unity= According to James Mitchell, in the Renaissance the dome began to be a symbol throughout Europe of the unity of religion. The astrological depiction of star constellations in the small dome above the altar of the Old Sacristy of the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence, has been calculated to represent July 6, 1439 at about noon, the date of the closing session of the Council of Florence, in which the Articles of Union between Eastern and Western Christendom were signed by Latin and Greek delegates. Micha≈Ç Kurzej argues that the domed transept likely \\"became a distinguishing feature of Roman Catholic Church buildings\\" in the 16th century and that imitation of Italian architecture outside of Italy at this time indicated partiality towards Roman Catholicism over Protestantism. Nathaniel Curtis wrote that the large domes of the Renaissance implied \\"ideas of power, dominance or centralization - as the capitol of a nation or of a state.\\" He noted that Guadet said of St. Peter's, \\"it is less the roof of the greatest of all churches than the covering and sign of this centre to which converges the entire unity of Catholicism.\\" Wolfgang Born wrote that, according to Walter Tunk, \\"The Bavarian type of the bulbous dome is said to have originated from a fusion between a pointed spire and a dome.\\" Hans Schindler states that \\"the onion spire carried the prestige of well-known pilgrimage churches and allowed a new church to indicate its kinship with them\\". Piotr Krasny writes that the \\"five domes crowning traditional Ruthenian Orthodox churches were believed to symbolise the Five Patriarchs, who according to Orthodox ecclesiology wielded equal power in the Church. In the 17th century the five domes were replaced by one, symbolising the pope's primacy which was acknowledged by the Uniat Church.\\" =Circles and ovals= Centrally planned churches in Europe spread from the middle of the fifteenth century onward as part of the Renaissance. Sylvie Duvernoy writes that the 1450 architectural treatise written by Leon Battista Alberti was inspired by Vitruvius' ancient book De architectura but written from a humanist perspective and, unlike Vitruvius, advocated for central plans because the circle was \\"the favourite shape of nature\\". Of the nine church designs provided in the book, six were circular or polygonal centrally planned designs, with the polygonal shapes recommended to be drawn with equal angles so that they can be inscribed in a circle. Irene Giustina writes that, in Renaissance Italy, the pointed dome was considered structurally safer but was also \\"against the rules of antique architecture\\". The pointed profile was considered barbarian and timburios were used as much to conceal the dome's shape externally as for structural reasons. Semicircular dome profiles were preferred. The appearance of the oval in architecture has been extensively discussed by architectural historians. Although not an idea originating in the Renaissance, by the beginning of the 1500s the idea of the oval was \\"in the air\\", according to Santiago Huerta. During the discussions of the Council of Trent (1545-1563), which began the Counter-Reformation of the Catholic Church in response to the Protestant Reformation, the circle and square were declared too pagan for Christian churches. Although the council did not make any direct pronouncements regarding architecture and, according to Hanno-Walter Kruft, the effects of those reforms actually adopted by the Council were varied, the one known written example of the Council's resolutions being applied to architecture, Cardinal Charles Borromeo's Instructiones fabricae et supellectilis ecclesiasticae of 1577, \\"condemns the circular form as heathenish.\\" The publication was addressed only to Borromeo's own diocese of Milan, but gained currency throughout Europe. Victoria Hammond writes that, in addition to the oval form's inherent appeal, its use in domes may have been influenced by the European Age of Exploration, as well as by the theory of the elliptical orbits of planets. Sylvie Duvernoy notes that while Johannes Kepler was too young to have influenced the initial popularity of oval churches, the 1609 publication of his discovery of the elliptical motion of planets could have contributed to their persistence. Sylvie Duvernoy writes that the use of a circular plan and an oval plan in the twin domed churches built between 1662 and 1679 at the northern entrance to the city of Rome, Santa Maria dei Miracoli and Santa Maria in Montesanto, indicates that the two forms were then considered symbolically equivalent. Islam The Green Dome built above the tomb of Muhammad, Abu Bakr and Umar in the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi (Prophet's Mosque) in Medina, Saudi Arabia, dates back to at least the 12th century. Royalty According to Oleg Grabar, the domes of the Islamic world, which rejected Christian-style iconography, continued the other traditions. Muslim royalty built palatial pleasure domes in continuation of the Roman and Persian imperial models, although many have not survived, and domed mausoleums from Merv to India developed the form. In the early centuries of Islam, domes were closely associated with royalty. A dome built in front of the mihrab of a mosque, for example, was at least initially meant to emphasize the place of a prince during royal ceremonies. Over time such domes became primarily focal points for decoration or the direction of prayer. The use of domes in mausoleums can likewise reflect royal patronage or be seen as representing the honor and prestige that domes symbolized, rather than having any specific funerary meaning. The wide variety of dome forms in medieval Islam reflected dynastic, religious, and social differences as much as practical building considerations. Theology Oleg Grabar characterizes forms in Islamic architecture as having relatively low levels of symbolism. While conceding this in a general sense, Yasser Tabbaa maintains that certain forms were initially very highly symbolic and only lost such associations over time. The phenomenon of muqarnas domes, in particular, is an example. Tabbaa explains the development and spread of muqarnas domes throughout the Islamic world beginning in the early 11th century as the visual expression of a theological idea of the universe propounded by the Ash'arites (a modification of the Atomism of Aristotle with Occasionalism), which rose to prominence in Baghdad at this time. Only later was the style used in a purely decorative manner. Doƒüan Kuban writes that even seemingly minor variations in shape, structure, and functional use had theoretical implications, and were the \\"result of complex and culturally significant developments in the Islamic world, where the dome and minaret became symbols of Islam.\\" Theresa Grupico writes that the use of the octagon in the Dome of the Rock, imperial funerary architecture, or mosque architecture may be a borrowing from earlier Byzantine or Persian use or reflect the idea of Paradise having \\"eight gardens with eight doors\\". The use of Koranic text to decorate the pendentives of domes in the Islamic world replaces the human depictions of Christian iconography, such as the Four Evangelists, but similarly represents the way to the Word of God. Ottoman mosques, such as the Mosque of Suleyman the Great in Istanbul, have been interpreted as \\"challenging\\" the Hagia Sophia or \\"inviting similarities\\" of message beyond the merely visual. Government Early modern legislatures Thomas Markus writes that the dome became a symbol of democratic political power over the course of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries. The Irish Parliament House in Dublin included an octagonal dome over a central chamber for the House of Commons. Edward McParland writes that the location of the space, especially relative to the barrel-vaulted House of Lords, which was off axis on the east side of the building, may have symbolized a political dominance by the House of Commons. Kendall Wallis writes that the decision to build the national capitol building of the United States with a large dome \\"took a form laden with symbolic sacred meaning and ascribed a radically secular meaning to it.\\" The decorative use of coffers is meant to evoke a connection with the classical origins of democracy and republicanism. \\"It represented the legislative power of the republic\\", sanctified. The ideas of religious association and sky symbolism also persisted in their resonance with the providential overtones of America's sense of its vocation in the world and, more pronounced in the state capitols, in the stars and sky scenes depicted on the domes. Those state capitol domes built after the American Civil War that resembled the second national capitol dome referred symbolically to the Federal government and so to the idea of \\"the Union\\". Dictatorship Both Hitler and Stalin planned, but never completed, enormous domed assembly halls as part of their efforts to establish global capital cities. Hitler's Volkshalle, or \\"People's Hall\\", was meant to have a dome 250 meters wide and hold 200,000 people. The Palace of the Soviets in Moscow was meant to be the tallest building in the world, rising above a domed congress hall 100 meters wide for 21,000 world socialist delegates. The foundations were begun for the Palace of the Soviets on the site of the demolished Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, but technical problems postponed the project and it was abandoned after Stalin's death in the 1950s. R. J. Overy writes that these were meant to be monuments to dictatorship and Utopian civilization that would last for ages. Modern legislatures According to Giovanni Rizzoni, although the dome traditionally represented absolute power, the modern glass dome of the German Reichstag building expresses both the sovereignty of the people, who as tourists are literally above the legislature while touring the dome, and the accessibility of parliamentary democracy, due to the transparency of the glass dome and the window it provides into the legislative chamber below. William Seale writes that the dome is an accepted architectural symbol across the world for democratic legislatures.

He is best known for La Samaritaine, an Art Nouveau department store built in the 1st arrondissement of Paris in three stages between 1904 and 1928. He was respected as an authority on Art Nouveau. Life Frantz Jourdain was born in 1847. In the 1860s he studied in Paris at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. He obtained French citizenship in 1870. Critic Jourdain was a theoretician of Art Nouveau. He began writing on the arts in 1875, and by the end of his life had published about two hundred articles in sixty magazines and newspapers, at first news items but later critical articles in which he expressed his thoughts on art. Some of these were gathered into collections in 1886 and 1931. His writings were eclectic. Apart from writing on artistic questions he published a picaresque romance, two collections of short stories, a novel, a play and two collections of portraits of artists. Between 1880 and 1910 Jourdain was at the forefront of the movement to renew and synthesize the arts, and played an important role in introducing new ideas. He discovered unknown painters of the late 19th century and was a great admirer of the Galerie des machines of the Exposition Universelle (1889), designed by Ferdinand Dutert and Victor Contamin. In 1887 he was admitted to the Soci√©t√© des gens de lettres. He had become a prominent and often quoted art critic by the 1890s, an opponent of academic training and of the English Arts and Crafts movement. He was hostile to institutions such as the Beaux- Arts, which stifled new talent, and thought the Prix de Rome which sent artists to the Villa Medici to study the well-known antiquities was a waste of time. Architect La Samaritaine Magazin 1 La Samaritaine, a department store, was founded by Ernest Cognacq in 1870 when he leased a small part of a building for commercial use. He then bought the building, and in stages bought the building that faces it on the rue de la Monnaie. In 1885 he engaged Jourdain to redesign the original building, and at the same time began to improve the exterior of the building. In 1904 Cognacq decided to expand the store. Jourdain was given the job of creating the maximum amount of space as quickly and cheaply as possible, and designed a radical steel structure. The flamboyant exterior decoration was executed by his son, the decorator Francis Jourdain, the painter Eug√®ne Grasset, the metalworker Edouard Schenck and the ceramist Alexandre Bigot. His use of glass and an exposed steel frame in this design was both radical and functional, although soon after completion it drew criticism from a new generation of architects that rejected Art Nouveau. Hi work was part of the architecture event in the art competitions at the 1912 Summer Olympics. La Semeuse de Paris was built between 1910 and 1912 to house the credit department of La Samaritaine department stores for lending to the poorest customers. The art nouveau building also contained apartments. It was listed as a historical monument on 11 December 2000. In 1925 Cognacq was authorized to construct a second building. Jourdain and Henri Sauvage began work in January 1926, and completed it in September 1928 after many changes from the original plan. At the request of the prefecture the steel frame was given a cream-colored stone exterior. Jourdain built Store 3 on the lot bounded by the rues de Rivoli, Pont-Neuf and Boucher between 1930 and 1933. The interior is best preserved in Store 2, with a glass roof, wide staircases and characteristic bright blue, green and orange colors. Later years From 1903 Jourdain was president of the Salon d'Automne. He was a founding member of the Soci√©t√© du Nouveau Paris, a group that promoted modernization of Paris. Frantz Jourdain died in 1935. His son Francis Jourdain (1876-1958) was a designer, writer and painter. Francis Jourdain said of the society in which he grew up that it was dominated by people who were highly opinionated and quick to take sides. Although its members pretended to be in favor of liberty and compassion, he saw it as tainted by prejudices, xenophobia and extreme emotion. His father was very much typical of this society.

Many like sports because one must shoot at the right time, but it has never quite satisfied me; dance has.‚Äù References Category:Mexican photographers Category:Mexican women photographers Category:1949 births Category:German emigrants to Mexico Category:Living people ","title":"Christa Cowrie"},{"id":"45711581","text":"The following television stations in the United States brand as channel 13 (though neither using virtual channel 13 nor broadcasting on physical RF channel 13): * KJCT-DT3 in Grand Junction, Colorado * WSCG in Baxley, Georgia The following television stations in Mexico brand as channel 13 (though neither using virtual channel 13 nor broadcasting on physical RF channel 13): * XHDTV-TDT in Tecate, Baja California, serving Tijuana, Baja California/San Diego, California, United States The following television stations in the United States formerly branded as channel 13: * KPSE-LD in Palm Springs, California 13 branded 13 ","title":"Channel 13 branded TV stations in the United States"},{"id":"45711615","text":"Esin Hakaj (born 12 December 1996) is an Albanian professional footballer who plays as a left-back for FK Partizani Tirana in the Albanian Superliga.

Originally published in Lennox's periodical The Lady's Museum as Harriet and Sophia between 1760-1, this novel is only the second British novel to be serialized in a magazine, and the first one to be published this way by a woman. Major Characters * Sophia Darnley ‚Äì Mr. Darnley's younger daughter. Sophia attracts Sir Charles Stanley away from her sister but, because of her poverty, doubts his honorable intentions. She ends up treating him coldly, which leads him to doubt her love. Eventually Mr. Herbert helps her win him over. * Harriet Darnley ‚Äì Sophia Darnley's older sister. She is more beautiful than her sister, but is also vain, supercilious, and expensive.

A gentleman, he marries a beautiful and expensive wife, squanders his fortune and dies, leaving his family in poverty. * Sir Charles Stanley ‚Äì Wealthy, handsome would-be seducer of Harriet Darnley.

However, once he begins doubting the sincerity of Sophia's love, he retracts his favor. He is reconciled to Sophia through the efforts of Mr. Herbert. * Mr. Herbert ‚Äì Mr. Darnley's relation and family adviser. He helps protect Sophia Darnley from her rapacious mother and sister by lodging her with the respectable Lawsons, and intercedes with Sir Charles Stanley to bring about the happy ending.

Dolly is an innocent country girl who becomes Sophia Darnley's friend and confidante; she loves William Gibbons but is prevented from marrying him due to the objections of his aunt. Sophia eventually makes peace between the two families. * William Gibbons ‚Äì Farmer's son. He is educated as a gentleman by his aunt, though he prefers to follow in his father's path and become a farmer. While he is talking to Sophia about his romantic difficulties, he is seen by Sir Charles Stanley and mistaken for a rival for Sophia's affections. * Mr. Lawson ‚Äì Country curate. Mr. Lawson is paid by Mr. Herbert to take Sophia Darnley in when Sir Charles Stanley's attentions take a suspicious turn. * Mrs. Lawson ‚Äì Sensible and polite wife of the curate Mr. Lawson. Her ridicule of Mrs. Gibbons leads that lady to break her daughter Dolly Lawson's engagement to William Gibbons. * Mrs. Gibbons ‚Äì William Gibbons's aunt and godmother. Mrs. Gibbons is proud of her false and rigid ‚Äúgood breeding.‚Äù She takes offense at Mrs. Lawson's raillery and forbids the match between Dolly Lawson and William. * Mr. Gibbons ‚Äì William Gibbons's father. He is a farmer. * Mr. Howard ‚Äì Mrs. Howard's nineteen-year-old son. His love for Sophia Darnley enrages his mother and leads to Sophia's dismissal. * Mrs. Barton ‚Äì Mr. Barton's mother.

Inspired by Paul Chabas' September Morn, it followed a young sailor who had a nude figure tattooed on his chest but was forced to tattoo clothes on the figure. This now-lost film was reviewed positively in The Moving Picture World. Plot Dennis, a young sailor, is distraught over his lack of tattoos and envious of those which adorn his fellow sailors' skins. While on shore leave, he decides to visit a tattoo parlor and have his body inked. He initially rejects all the patterns shown to him, but is entranced by one which depicts a young nude woman standing in water. He has the figure tattooed onto his chest, then leaves the parlor. Meanwhile, Dennis's girlfriend Genevieve, a leader in the Purity League, raids a shop which is depicting a nude, Paul Chabas' September Morn, in the window. Her attempt to have the work removed fails when the shop's owner knocks her out of the door by spraying her with a powerful hose. She returns home to find Dennis with his tattoo, which depicts the same maiden as the painting. Enraged at Dennis' tattoo, Genevieve sends him back to the parlor to have the tattooed figure clothed. When Dennis has the nude clothed in a split skirt, Genevieve is incensed, and accompanies him back to the parlor. There, she forces Dennis to have the nude's torn skirt \\"sewn\\", and the remainder of her body completely clothed. Genevieve also has the words \\"Votes for Women\\" tattooed on Dennis' chest. Production Chabas' September Morn; the film was released shortly after the painting became controversial. This two-reel film was completed by Path√©. It starred Charles Arling, Caroline Rankin, and Joseph Burke. The film's title was a reference to the painting September Morn by French artist Paul Chabas, which had been at the center of controversy in 1913. The painting, which depicted a young woman standing nude along a lake shore, had been displayed in a New York City shop when Anthony Comstock, head of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, saw it and ordered it to be removed. Though a clerk did so, the shop manager reinstated the work. This apparent act of censorship led to widespread polemics in the media, as well as a burgeoning industry of related products, including post cards, calendars, and songs. The nude figure from Chabas' painting formed the source of the young sailor's tattoo. Reception and analysis September Morn was released on February 25, 1914. In the Chillicothe Morning Constitution, it was advertised as a \\"comedy that is different\\". A review in The Moving Picture World described the production as far-fetched and clearly exploitative of the titular painting, but original and amusing. The film was the first of two to be directly inspired by Chabas' painting. A second, September Mourning, was released in November 1915 by L-KO. It followed a pair of artists first vying for the attentions of a young woman in the park, then invading a school for girls. September Morn is now believed lost. The film scholar Norman Taylor considers September Morn to serve the political purpose of ridiculing the purity and women's suffrage movements.
