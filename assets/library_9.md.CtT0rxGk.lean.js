Voters chose six electors to represent them in the Electoral College. Arkansas overwhelmingly voted for the Democratic Party, former governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter and his running mate Minnesota U.S. Senator Walter Mondale with 64.94% of the vote. The Carter/Mondale ticket defeated Republican incumbent president Gerald Ford of Michigan and his running mate Kansas U.S. Senator Bob Dole in the state by a margin of 30.01%. Arkansas weighed in as more than thirty percent more Democratic than the national average.Dave Leip‚Äôs U.S. Election Atlas; 1976 Presidential General Election Results ‚Äì Arkansas Analysis Politics in Arkansas during this time period were dominated by the Democratic Party. In the last few elections, the party‚Äôs influence began to decline due to Southern Democrats having opposed the national party‚Äôs support for the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, resulting in George Wallace and Richard Nixon carrying the state in 1968 and 1972 respectively. In the aftermath of Watergate and Nixon‚Äôs resignation, the nation, including Arkansas‚Äô overall mood towards the Republican Party dropped. Jimmy Carter, a native Southern and former governor of Georgia, appealed to many Southern Democrats and Arkansas voters who saw him as a Washington outsider. Carter carried Arkansas in a landslide, winning 72 of the state‚Äôs 75 counties, the vast majority of which gave him over sixty percent of the vote. Carter‚Äôs weakest performance was in the state‚Äôs northwestern region, historically the strongest region in the state for Republicans. The following three counties were carried by President Ford: Baxter (Mountain Home), Benton (Bentonville, Rogers), and Sebastian (Fort Smith). , this is the last presidential election that the Democratic candidate won over sixty percent of the vote in Arkansas. The state would become friendlier towards the Republican Party after 1980, the only exceptions to this being 1992 and 1996, when Arkansas native Bill Clinton won the state in both of his presidential runs. This is also the last election in which Searcy County and Crawford County voted for the Democratic candidate.Sullivan, Robert David; ‚ÄòHow the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century‚Äô; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Results { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" - style=\\"background-color:#E9E9E9\\" ! colspan=\\"6\\"  United States presidential election in Arkansas, 1976 -bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\" align=\\"center\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width: 15em\\" Party ! style=\\"width: 17em\\" Candidate ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" Votes ! style=\\"width: 7em\\" Percentage ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" Electoral votes - ! style=\\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\\" style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Democratic  align=\\"right\\"  Jimmy Carter  align=\\"right\\"  499,614  align=\\"right\\"  64.94%  align=\\"right\\"  6 - ! style=\\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\\" style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Republican  align=\\"right\\"  Gerald Ford  align=\\"right\\"  268,753  align=\\"right\\"  34.93%  align=\\"right\\"  0 - ! style=\\"background-color:White; width: 3px\\" style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Write-ins  align=\\"right\\" Eugene McCarthy  align=\\"right\\" 647  align=\\"right\\" 0.08%  align=\\"right\\" 0 - ! style=\\"background-color:White; width: 3px\\" style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Write- ins  align=\\"right\\" Thomas J.

Based in Portland, Oregon, Bates founded the project in 2013 and released the debut album, Soon Asleep, in 2015. Bates collaborates with other musicians during his home recordings and live shows.  History  Before forming Drowse, Bates played in local bands and recorded music on his laptop. In 2011 Bates experienced a dissociative mental breakdown that would inform the first few Drowse releases. In 2013 he released an EP, Songs to Sleep On through Television Records and began performing live with help from various Portland musicians. Drowse released its debut album Soon Asleep through Apneic Void Sounds in 2015. The album featured Portland based singer Tuesday Faust. Following the release of Soon Asleep, Drowse recorded music that was contributed to Miserable's 2016 album, Uncontrollable. In 2016 Drowse released an EP titled Memory Bed through New York based label The Native Sound. Memory Bed featured vocal and lyrical collaborations with Maya Stoner. Drowse signed to The Flenser to release sophomore album Cold Air in 2018. Directly after the release Bates became an artist in residence in Skagastr√∂nd, Iceland, resulting in new work including Fog Storm pts. 1-4, released as a split with Planning For Burial. Light Mirror, Drowse's second album for The Flenser, was announced for release in 2019‚Äìit features material recorded in Iceland and at home. Drowse has shared the stage with a wide range of musical acts, including Planning for Burial and King Woman.  Musical style  Drowse derives influence from multiple genres and has been labeled \\"drone-pop\\", \\"shoegaze/drone\\", and \\"dream pop.\\" Vice described the project's sound as \\"the aural equivalent of blood rushing back to a sleeping limb\\" and likened it to a \\"post-black metal take on\\" English shoegazing band Slowdive and Texas post- rock band Explosions in the Sky. Spin writer Matt Malone noted that \\"Drowse prioritizes music over lyrics, using vocals not to tell a story as much as add an instrumental layer to the music's soothing fog.\\" A.V. Club critic Brian Shultz characterized the project's sound as \\"breathy, entrancing, and certainly a little bit eerie.\\" Cris Lankenau, writing for Willamette Week, compared Drowse to other Pacific Northwest musical acts Mount Eerie and Grouper. Lars Gotrich from NPR reinforced the comparison, saying \\"Drowse [...] sounds like an intimate Mount Eerie home recording overdubbed with a worn-out cassette of The Cure's Disintegration.\\"  Discography = Studio Albums  * Soon Asleep (2015; Apneic Void Sounds) * Cold Air (2018; The Flenser) *Light Mirror (2019; The Flenser)  Mini-LPs, EPs and split releases  *Songs to Sleep On EP (2013; Television Records) * Memory Bed Ep(2016; The Native Sound) *Fog Storm pts. 1-4 Split w/ Planning for Burial (2018; Glowing Window Recordings) *Second Self Mini-LP(2019; The Flenser)  Other releases  * Naive Sleep (2014; self-released) * Covered (2015; self-released)  Music videos  * \\"Melt\\" (2015; dir.

Location The hamlet lies on the old east-west A30 (London-Penzance) road, between Exeter and Okehampton at the cross-roads with the south-north route up to Bideford. The 'down' itself is a ridge of high farmland some 800 feet above sea level with commanding views. Recorded as Whyddon Doune in 1535 and as Whiddon Downe in 1661, it is named after its medieval landowners, the Whiddon family of nearby Chagford. History There have been scattered farms in the area since Saxon times, but the hamlet was only established with the turn- piking of the south-north road in the 18th century, when a 15th-century crossroads dwelling became a coaching inn and post point (The Post Inn). In the modern era, the village has long been well-served by buses due to its location. The dualling of this section of the A30 in the late 1980s means that the hamlet is now bypassed by the A30 itself, but it remains a major road junction point, with a service station (Whiddon Down Service Area) and Travelodge. Population growth in the 19th century was sufficient for the establishment of a small primary school in 1879 and a Methodist church in 1906. The school closed in 1959 and now serves as a village hall. The community was expanded with council housing in the 1970s.

Hall & Co., Boston, 1985 p.427  Life  Born Sara Darmolatova into a wealthy Saint Petersburg family, Her elder sister was the writer and socialite Anna Radlova. Lebedeva was educated privately in her youth. She studied for a time at the School of the Society of for the Encouragement of the Arts in her native city before entering Mikhail Bernshtein's school in 1910; she became a sculptor two years later, studying with Leonid Sherwood from 1912 until 1914. During this time she also travelled to France, Germany, Austria and Italy, travels which introduced her to the work of the artists of the Italian Renaissance, of whom Donatello was to become a favorite. In 1914 she designed masks and reliefs for the Yusupov Palace while working with the sculptor Vasili Kuznetsov as a pupil and, later, assistant. After this she transitioned mainly to portrait and figure work. In 1915 she married the painter and graphic artist Vladimir Lebedev. After the Russian Revolution Lebedeva took a position teaching at the Free Art Studios in Petrograd from 1918 to 1920; there she became acquainted with Vladimir Tatlin, Kazimir Malevich, and Nathan Altman, among other artists. She also entered into the local artistic milieu, becoming acquainted with intellectuals such as Maxim Gorky, Alexander Blok, Vladimir Mayakovsky, and Vsevolod Meyerkhold. She designed propaganda, producing a model for a silver ruble coin featuring an anvil and tools in 1918 and producing monuments to Georges Danton, Maximilien de Robespierre, and Alexander Herzen. From 1919 to 1920 she taught at the Stieglitz Institute in Petrograd, and in the 1920s began working in ceramics as well as producing designs for the theater. She moved to Moscow, and in 1925 she visited London. Her career as a portrait sculptor began in earnest in the same year with a portrait bust of Felix Dzerzhinsky. In 1928 she visited Paris and Berlin, and exhibited at the Venice Biennale, showing work at the latter again in 1932. In 1934 she began producing ceramic ware for the Konakovsky Factory, near which she lived, continuing until 1936; she also continued to produce portrait busts, including of Vera Mukhina, Aleksandr Tvardovsky, Aaron Soltz, Leonid Krasin, Vsevolod Ivanov, and Alexander Tsyurupa, among others. Her portrait of the pilot Valery Chkalov in the Tretyakov Gallery is ‚Äúan extremely characteristic work, displaying ‚Äúenergetic moulding‚Ä¶that makes it living and dynamic.‚ÄùSopotsinsky, Oleg, complied and introduced by, Aurora Art Publishers, Leningrad, 1978 p. 435 She also produced portrait sculptures of industrial workers. A handful of figure sculptures exist as well; Lebedeva also executed designs for three monuments, none of which were ever realized. In 1920 Lebedeva became a member of the Society of Russian Sculptors, exhibiting with them in that year, in 1929, and again in 1931. She was the subject of a personal exhibition at the State Museum of New Western Art in Moscow in 1941; in 1945 she became an Honored Artist of the RSFSR, and in 1958 she was made a Corresponding Member of the Academy of Arts of the USSR. She continued exhibiting in Moscow and Leningrad, becoming a close friend of Tatlin's and donating a large collection of his papers and artwork to the Central State Archive of Art and Literature in the 1960s. She died in Moscow; memorial exhibits were held at the Tretyakov Gallery and at the State Russian Museum. She is buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Besides Donatello, Cranach and Rembrandt were among early influences on Lebedeva's work, and pieces from her youth suggest that at the time she had no awareness of trends in the world of modern art. Another early interest was impressionism, traces of which continue to be seen in pieces which she produced throughout her career. Her future husband introduced her to the work of Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and Henri Matisse, whose art would go on to influence her a great deal. She preferred to craft using only the tips of her fingers rather than her entire hand to model. Her preferred medium was bronze. A statue of Seraphim Znamensky by Lebedeva is held by the Russian Museum, as are numerous other works; she is also well-represented in the collection of the State Tretyakov Gallery. She was also responsible for the profile image of Boris Pasternak, a lifelong friend, which graces his grave marker at Peredelkino. Lebedeva is the namesake of a crater on Venus.

Early life and career Richard Reading was born in Bury, Lancashire and was the son of T. Reading, of Warwickshire, England. Reading was educated in Birmingham. A well-regarded sports journalist, Reading rose to prominence writing for Manchester's \\"Sporting Chronicle\\", acted as the sporting editor for Manchester's \\"Daily Sketch\\" and was president Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser 01 March 1909, p8 of the Manchester Press Club. Reading was a friend and contemporary of the war correspondent Sir Basil Clarke and became the subject of Clarke's first important correspondence from the front.* Belgian service and the First World War At the outbreak of the First World War, the British army rejected Reading because he was over its age limit. Undeterred, Reading as part of the Manchester Troop of the Legion of Frontiersmen travelled to Belgium.Geoffrey A. Pocock. One Hundred Years of the Legion of Frontiersmen. Chichester, UK: Phillimore, 2004. There he initially enlisted with the 3rd Belgian Lancers in the early stages of the war and was soon promoted to the rank of corporal. He transferred to a Minerva Armored Car unit,Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser 23 March 1915 the Corps de Mitrailleuses () under Count Pierre de Lunden, that was active at both the Belgian and French Fronts. It was Reading's actions in this capacity that saw him awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre and made a Chevalier of the Order of Leopold. An account of his heroism follows. Reading had been on a scouting expedition with his armoured car unit when he identified an advance guard of the German army. The Germans had set up an ambush and opened fire. Reading was able to warn the other four men of the unit, instructing them to save themselves and the armoured car and not to worry about him. Under gunfire, the car moved off at speed. For a quarter of a mile, the occupants were unaware that Reading had grasped on to the back of the car and was being dragged. Reading had been shot in both legs by German expanding bullets and had also sustained significant injuries from being dragged at speed. Despite his wounds, he was described by a nurse as coming \\"in on a stretcher bright as a button, smoking a cigar and laughing\\".* Reading required multiple surgeries and spent two years at Worsley New Hall convalescing from the wounds he sustained in this skirmish that left him needing the aid of crutches to walk. Reading's casual bravado \\"encapsulated the spirit of adventure-seeking that was typical of the attitudes of many Britons during the early part of the war\\". Post-war life Following his recuperation, Reading sailed to Australia on the P & O Line's \\"Mongolia\\" to join his two brothers George and Frederick in Bangalow, New South Wales. During the sea journey, the \\"Mongolia\\" struck a German mine and sank off the coast of Mumbai (then called Bombay) in 1917 with the loss of 23 lives. Reading, badly injured by shrapnel from the explosion, survived the sinking. A cabin mate rescued him before the ship sank. There are reports of an extended time at sea before the survivors reached land. Reading was then carried on a stretcher by locals to the closest township and was further hospitalized for 6 months in Bombay. His survival had achieved some notoriety seeing Reading dubbed \\"The Man Who Would Not Die\\". On his eventual arrival in Australia, Reading initially settled in Brunswick Heads, New South Wales. Reading worked in oyster culture in the region for 5 years. During this time, he married Mary Drusilla Taylor on 8 July 1920 at the Church of St Mary Ballina. Taylor was the daughter of the late Thomas Taylor; a grazier of Graham's Valley, Glencoe and was matron of Byron Hospital, Bangalow. Taylor had been a nurse in Belgium during the war.http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/98245827?searchTerm=bird%20sanctuary%20brunswick%20heads%20reading&searchLimits;= Reading contributed to the community in the area.

Reading rekindled his singing and was a popular baritone participating in the local social and cultural life. He performed for patriotic and charitable concerts in the Richmond River district and successfully competed in local eisteddfodau in Armidale, New South Wales and Queensland. Following medical advice, Reading ceased oyster cultivation. Reading and his wife left for Melbourne when he gained a position as sub-editor for the sporting section of The Herald. He worked there for approximately 18 months until shortly before his death in 1929 aged 53. He maintained his interest in singing as a member of the St Paul's Cathedral Choir. The Choir paid special tribute to Reading during his memorial service, draping his seat with both the Union Jack and the Belgian Flag. A Belgian wreath was placed on his coffin by Rev. R. Sherwood, Precentor of St. Paul's, for the Belgian Consul General \\"as a token of gratitude from the Belgian nation for a gallant and brave soldier \\".

Outdoor stages were utilized by dramatizing the daily lives, where merchants had to try and get the people's attention from the stage. They often had a backdrop to show a general location. Some scholars debate the immense stigma and hatred generated by these troupes. This could have played a part in deterring people from performing in the street due to this stigma. This stigma grew so much that actress Isabella Andreini wrote to the governor of Milan complaining about them. The earliest knowledge of commedia staging is when Ferdinand, a son of Albrecht V, Duke of Bavaria, went to Florence for a wedding.

It was one of a relatively small number of formations raised to Guards status in the northern sector of the Soviet-German Front. As such, it was employed as an assault division in the subsequent fighting, particularly in the final defeat of the German forces before Leningrad, and the final offensive against Finland. The division ended the war in Lithuania, helping to contain the enemy forces trapped in the Courland Pocket, and went on to serve well into the postwar era, still in the Leningrad/St. Petersburg area.  Formation  When the 64th Guards was formed, its basic order of battle was as follows: * 191st Guards Rifle Regiment from 1098th Rifle Regiment * 194th Guards Rifle Regiment from 1100th Rifle Regiment * 197th Guards Rifle Regiment from 1102nd Rifle Regiment * 134th Guards Artillery Regiment from 894th Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", Soviet Guards Rifle and Airborne Units 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IV, 1995, p 70 The division was considered a \\"sister\\" to the 63rd Guards Rifle Division, which was forming in the same area at the same time. The two divisions served almost the entire remainder of the war in 30th Guards Rifle Corps.Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", p 71 During Operation Polyarnaya Zvezda, in February and March, the 64th Guards was in 8th Army. On March 19 it was in the army's second echelon as it started its attack from south of Voronovo towards Mga. During the first three days of intense fighting the first echelon divisions penetrated 3 - 4 km along a 7 km front at the junction of the defending 1st and 223rd Infantry Divisions. The army commander, Lt. Gen. F.N. Starikov, then committed a small mobile group, the 191st Guards Rifle Regiment and a battalion of the 122nd Tank Brigade, with orders to cut the rail line between Mga and Kirishi, and then wheel northwest towards Mga Station. Despite heavy rain which prevented any air support, the group reached the rail line east of Turyshkino Station before being halted by hastily assembled German reinforcements. A further effort was made by the full division, backed by 14th Rifle Division and 1st Separate Rifle Brigade from reserve, on April 1 against the German defenses around Karbusel, just east of the Mga-Kirishi line. This attack was repelled by the 121st Infantry Division, with heavy losses to the attackers. This marked the end of Polarnaya Zvezda, and the Soviets went over to the defense the following day.David M. Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad 1941 - 1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, pp 301-02  Breaking the Siege  At the start of the Fifth Siniavino Offensive on July 22, 64th Guards was in the newly formed 30th Guards Rifle Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. Nikolai Simoniak, in 67th Army. The corps' objective was to capture Arbuzovo and advance on Mga from the north, supported by the 30th Guards and 220th Tank Brigades and the 31st and 29th Guards Tank Regiments. At the start of the operation the division was in the corps' second echelon. On the second day 63rd Guards Rifles occupied the first line of enemy trenches in the Arbuzovo region, and the second line the next morning, but by August 4 the attack had bogged down in the face of German reinforcements, becoming little more than an exchange of artillery and mortar fire.Glantz, pp 308-11 30th Guards Corps was pulled back for rest and refitting east of Leningrad later that month. On September 13 the corps headquarters got orders to prepare to take the leading role in the Sixth Siniavino Offensive. Once again, 64th Guards was to be in second echelon. On September 15, following a reorganized and improved artillery fire plan, and with significant air support, the three Guards divisions stormed the Siniavino Heights and finally seized them in only 30 minutes. This brought an end to the struggle that had been waged for this position for nearly two years at the cost of hundreds of thousands of casualties. Having achieved this objective, the offensive quickly wound down.Glantz, pp 315-19 As of January 1, 1944, the 64th Guards was in 30th Guards Corps, now under 42nd Army in Leningrad Front. In the plan for the Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod Offensive, the three rifle corps of that army were to penetrate German defenses in the 17 km sector from Ligovo Station to Bolshoe Kuzmino southwest of Leningrad and liberate Krasnoye Selo. The assault began at 1100 hours on January 15, following an artillery preparation of 220,000 shells fired from 2,300 guns over one hour and 40 minutes. The three divisions of 30th Guards Corps attacked from Pulkovo Heights and by the end of the day had advanced 4.5 km through very dense defenses, although the corps on each flank encountered greater resistance. An advance of another 3 - 4 km was achieved the next day, but at greater cost. By the 17th the enemy forces north of Ropsha and Krasnoye Selo were under threat of encirclement, and 123rd Rifle Corps was committed on the right flank of 30th Guards Corps. On January 19 the encirclement was completed while the two rifle corps stormed Krasnoye Selo,Glantz, pp 328, 334, 340-44 and 64th Guards Rifle Division was granted that name as an honorific: It shared this honour with 63rd Guards and two divisions of the 123rd Corps.http://www.soldat.ru/spravka/freedom/1-ssr-3.html. Retrieved Oct. 30, 2016. For the remainder of January, 42nd Army pursued the defeated German forces in the direction of Kingisepp, which was liberated on February 1. In the course of this fighting, 2nd Shock Army forced two crossings of the Narva River, north and south of the fortress city of Narva. As a reward for this achievement, Leningrad Front transferred 30th Guards Corps to the latter army from the former on February 3. 2nd Shock launched a new attack on February 11, in which the 30th Guards Corps scored the only real success, advancing from the south to cut the road and railroad running from Narva to Iykhvi on the 15th, and taking Auvere with 64th Guards two days later. However, this was the limit reached, as the corps was counterattacked by Feldherrnhalle Panzergrenadier Division. The 64th, along with its corps, took significant casualties in this operation and soon were withdrawn for rebuilding.Glantz, pp 369, 372-75, 411  Karelian Offensive  In April, STAVKA's attention turned to completing the war with Finland. For this purpose Leningrad Front was reinforced with the headquarters of 21st Army on April 28. 30th Guards Corps was in Front reserves southwest of Leningrad at this time. In early May it was assigned to 21st Army.Glantz, pp 418, 420-21 When the offensive began on June 9 - 10, the 64th Guards was once again in second echelon of its corps.The Gamers, Inc., Karelia '44, Multi-Man Publishing, Inc., Millersville, MD, 2011, pp 4-5 Following initial penetrations of the line held by the Finnish IV Army Corps, 21st Army surged forward, and on the 11th the division was ordered to deploy forward, attack the flank and rear of the forces defending Khirelia, which were blocking the advance of 97th Corps, and capture the Khirelia-Perola line by the end of the day. 30th Guards Corps as a whole was to capture Kivennapa, one of the most important strongpoints in the Finns' second defensive belt, by the end of July 12. These initial operations were successful, and the Front commander, Army General Leonid Govorov, confidently expected to capture Vyborg by June 18-20.Glantz, pp 430-31 In the event, the city did fall on that latter date. Days later, at the start of the Battle of Tali-Ihantala, 64th Guards was about 15 km east of Vyborg, astride the rail line from there to Vuosalmi.Karelia '44, p 6  Baltic Offensive  In August, 30th Guards Corps was once again assigned to 2nd Shock Army. With the fighting around Narva finally ending that month, 2nd Shock was able to move past that choke-point towards Estonia, crossing the narrows between Lake Pskov and Lake Chud. By mid-September, 64th Guards was on the outskirts of Tartu, advancing northwards. In October, the division and its corps was reassigned to 8th Army, clearing the Baltic islands and coasts, where they would remain for the duration, helping to contain the former Army Group North in the Courland Pocket.The Gamers, Inc., Baltic Gap, Multi-Man Publishing, Inc., Millersville, MD, 2009, pp 30, 36, 38 When the shooting stopped the division was officially designated as the 64th Guards Rifle, Krasnoye Selo, Order of the Red Banner Division.

Postwar  The 64th Guards continued to serve well into the postwar era, still in 30th Guards Rifle Corps, which in 1957 was redesignated as 30th Guards Army Corps. In 1957, the division was converted into a motor rifle division at Sapyornoye. During Operation Anadyr, the four motor rifle regiments sent to Cuba in the Cuban Missile Crisis were drawn from the 30th Guards Army Corps. The 302nd, 314th, and 400th Regiments were formed from units of the 269th, 194th, and 197th Guards Regiments respectively. In Cuba, they became the 43rd, 74th, and 108th Regiments. In the late 1980s, the division included the 197th Guards and 269th Guards Motor Rifle Regiments, the 10th Artillery Regiment, the 1001st Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment, and other smaller units at Sapyornoye. The 194th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment was at Svobodnoye, and the 83rd Separate Tank Battalion and 75th Guards Separate Engineer-Sapper Battalion were at Pontonnoye. On June 1, 1997 the division was disbanded by being renamed the 36th Guards Weapons and Equipment Storage Base. The storage base was disbanded in 2007.

Synopsis  Imogen, a bear disguising herself as a human, makes her way to a London theatre in 1598 to convince a mapmaker to reverse the name change to her hometown. In the theatre she meets John Heminges and Henry Condell whose theatre troupe she subsequently hangs around with. As the thespians prepare to perform Much Ado About Nothing for the first time, the actors realize that a drunk John Heminges will be unable to perform without someone to help him stand up. Henry suggests that Imogen go on stage as Leonato's wife so that he can hold on to her arm to keep steady. Imogen breaks London's laws against women performing on stage and goes on as Leonato's wife. After the performance, the actors and Imogen go to a tavern and share stories. Later, Imogen helps the players deconstruct the theatre and move it across the Thames. While crossing the frozen river, the group encounters a bear. Imogen talks to the bear in order to protect the actors. The play briefly switches focus to a group of bears in a cage at the Paris Gardens. Henry and Imogen have sex, after which Henry invites Imogen to watch bear-baiting at the Gardens with the rest of the actors. While watching the bear-baiting, the Crier recognizes Imogen as a bear. Nicholas pretends to be Imogen's son and persuades the Crier that she is not a bear. Henry suggests to William Shakespeare that he should publish a folio edition of his plays. Imogen seeks out the bear cages but is caught by the Warden, who immediately recognizes her as a bear that escaped his captivity. Imogen frees the other bears but is caught by the Crier. The next morning, the players go to watch bear-baiting but only some of them recognize one of the bears as Imogen. Imogen asks them to kill her and Alexander eventually does. The players pretend that Alexander suffered a fit of madness in order to excuse his behaviour. Act three jumps to 1613 when the King's Men are preparing to perform at the court of King James and Queen Anne. They are interrupted by Anne's maid Anna Roos who demands that Imogen, Leonato's wife, be included in the play. Anna encountered Imogen in the quarto edition of the text. The players agree to let Anna play Imogen. John sees a map on the wall featuring the real Imogen's hometown called according to its proper name. Shakespeare agrees to make the folio edition. The play ends in 1623. Henry rushes to the printers to put Imogen, who he removed from the text, back into the play. Imogen appears and eats Henry.  Sources  Imogen Says Nothing's titular character, Imogen, comes from a ghost character in Shakespeare's comedy Much Ado About Nothing. In the First Folio, a character called Innogen appears in the stage directions but never speaks. The stage directions of act 1, scene 1 read \\"Enter Leonato Gouernour of Messina, Innogen his wife, He- / ro his daughter, and Beatrice his Neece, with a messenger.\\" Innogen is a ghost character who many scholars assume is a remnant of Shakespeare's earlier ideas for the play but was later written out. Kapil reads the double 'n' of Innogen to be a misprint for an m, producing the name Imogen. At Macalester College, Kapil played the role of Imogen. Imogen Says Nothing also plays on the line stage direction \\"He exits, pursued by a bear\\" in The Winter's Tale. The actors say they will perform The Winter's Tale after Much Ado About Nothing in act 3. The play also features many bears, including the titular Imogen. The play features several characters inspired by real Elizabethan actors of the King's Men, including William Shakespeare. The author's notes to the play state that \\"William Shakespeare is the least important person in this play.\\" Performance history Imogen Says Nothing premiered on January 20, 2017 at the Yale Repertory Theatre, who also commissioned the play, in New Haven, Connecticut. Imogen was played by Ashlie Atkinson, Christopher Ryan Grant played John Heminges, Hubert Point-Du Jour played Henry Condell, Christopher Geary played Alexander Cooke, Ricardo D√°villa played Nicholas Tooley, Thom Sesma played Richard Burbage, Daisuke Tsuji played William Shakespeare, Ben Horner played the Crier, and Zenzi Williams played Anna Roos.

Founded in 1892 by the College Settlements Association, it provided a variety of social and educational services to neighborhood residents, most of whom were immigrants. Several notable women worked there, including Nobel Prize winner Emily Greene Balch, labor organizer Mary Kenney O'Sullivan, and pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart. The original site at 93 Tyler Street is a stop on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.  History = Founding  Denison House was established in 1892, donated by Cornelia Warren, as one of the earliest branches of the College Settlements Association.Several sources claim that Denison House was one of the first settlement houses in the United States. According to the Harvard University Library, however, there were over 400 settlement houses in the U.S. by 1890. In her master's thesis, Heather Capitanio specifies that Denison House was \\"the third college settlement of its kind in the United States\\". The CSA had been founded in 1887 by a small group of Wellesley College faculty and alumnae including noted pacifist Emily Greene Balch, labor organizer Vida Scudder, and the writer and college professor Katharine Lee Bates.Barbuto (1999), p. 53. It was named for Edward Denison, an English social reformer who advocated living among the poor.Williams (2015), p. 258. Balch was an admirer of Jane Addams, whom she had met at an Ethical Culture Society gathering; Denison House was modeled after Addams's Hull House in Chicago. Its mission was to provide Boston's poor with social services and education, not only for philanthropic purposes but to break down class barriers. The women hoped that bringing people of different backgrounds together under one roof would further the purpose of democracy, which they defined as \\"a free flowing life between group and group\\". The original Denison House was located at 93 Tyler Street, a red brick row house across from the old Josiah Quincy School. It quickly outgrew that space, and the adjoining house was added on. By the 1920s it occupied five row houses with a shared entrance at number 93.Butler (2009), p. 128.; Kaufman (2006), p. 48. Its first head resident was Balch herself, who served there briefly before returning to academia.  1893‚Äì1912  Italian-American group, held cultural events at Denison House. Balch was replaced as head resident by Helena Dudley, who served from 1893 to 1912.James (1971), pp. 526‚Äì527. Arriving during the Panic of 1893, Dudley immediately set to work organizing the house as a relief agency that could distribute such basic necessities as milk and coal. Under her direction, Denison House became an important neighborhood center, offering classes in nursing, English literature, crafts, cooking, and carpentry, as well as sports and a summer camp for children, and clubs for adults. It had a library, a gymnasium, and a clinic. Later, Dudley cooperated with Robert Archey Woods and other residents of South End House‚ÄîBoston's first settlement house, located just a few blocks away‚Äîto hold art exhibitions, conduct housing investigations, and campaign for public bathhouses and gymnasiums. Local men and women who frequented Denison House, most of whom were immigrants, were encouraged to celebrate their heritage through cultural festivals and craft exhibitions. One such exhibition took place at the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art in 1917. On display was \\"the work of Italian, Syrian, Greek and Armenian craftsmen and craftswomen, in silver, leather, linen, silk embroideries, etc., from old designs copied in part from treasure pieces in palaces, museums and private collections in Europe and America.\\" The exhibition was reportedly a great success, with many of the items being sold.Miller (1917), p. 13. The teenaged boys of the Denison House dramatic club performed Shakespearean plays to raise funds for renovations, and received encouraging reviews in the Boston Globe. Among the early residents of Denison House was the labor organizer Mary Kenney O'Sullivan, who lived there for several years in the 1890s with her husband and three children. O'Sullivan, Dudley, and Scudder were among the founding members of the Women's Trade Union League in 1903. Mary Morton Kehew, president of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union, was treasurer of Denison House in the late 1890s,Deutsch (1992), p. 382. and the Christian Socialist writer W. D. P. Bliss gave a speech there in 1898. In an address at Wesleyan Hall, Dudley said that the college women had learned, through their work at the settlement house, \\"of the conditions which press upon the wage earners. We have found women making shirts for 37 and a half cents a dozen...and it is because of this knowledge that we have become interested in trade unions.\\" During Dudley's tenure several trade unions met regularly at Denison House, and in 1904 she hosted Catherine Breshkovsky, \\"grandmother of the Russian Revolution\\", at Denison House for several weeks.Blackwell (1918), p. 123. In 1912 Dudley and O'Sullivan paid the bail of $500 each for Joseph Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti, leaders of the 1912 Lawrence textile strike who had been arrested on trumped-up charges. Another Denison House worker, Vida Scudder, also supported the Lawrence strikers, and gave a widely publicized speech at a strike meeting. Wealthy donors were troubled by the house's connections to organized labor, and as fundraising became increasingly difficult, both Dudley and Scudder were forced to resign their positions.  1912‚Äì1942  Before she became a famous aviator, Amelia Earhart was a social worker at Denison House. She was hired in 1926 and in the fall of 1927 became a full-time staffer at 93 Tyler street, where she worked until her historic flight in the Friendship in June 1928.Ware (1994), p. 39. Commuting from Medford, Massachusetts in her yellow Kissel Speedster, she worked as a teacher and home visitor during the week, and spent her weekends flying. By that time the neighborhood was home to an increasing number of Chinese immigrants. Earhart was in charge of adult education, and supervised the girls' program. She organized women's clubs, such as the Syrian Mothers Club, and coached girls' basketball and fencing. In 1927 she flew over Boston and Cambridge, dropping leaflets to advertise a Denison House fundraiser.Butler (2009), p. 112. The following year she represented Denison House at the conference of the National Federation of Settlements, held in Boston, where she impressed leading members as \\"one of the most promising social workers of her generation\\".  1942‚Äìpresent  In 1942, Denison House relocated to Dorchester, where it occupied several local buildings before moving into the former Howard Avenue School in 1949. In 1965 it merged with Little House, Dorchester House, and the Columbia Point Youth Center to form the Federated Dorchester Neighborhood Houses (FDNH), which became College Bound Dorchester in 2010. The original site on Tyler Street, now occupied by apartment buildings, is a stop on the Chinatown/South Cove walk of the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.Kaufman (2006), p. 48.  Influence  Mary Kingsbury Simkhovitch, a city planner and social worker, met Helena Dudley and visited Denison House while living in Boston. The experience had a lasting influence on Simkhovitch; in 1902, she founded Greenwich House, a New York City settlement house which is still in operation today. The poet Kahlil Gibran and his younger relative, the sculptor Kahlil Gibran, lived in the South End as children and were frequent visitors to Denison House. It was there that the elder Gibran was introduced to the avant-garde Boston artist, photographer, and publisher Fred Holland Day, who encouraged him in his creative endeavors.History Project (1999), p. 88. The younger Gibran later recalled seeing Amelia Earhart there, dressed in jodhpurs and driving her bright yellow car.Gibran (2014), p. 16.

Since its founding, the USRF has supported programs that build Russian innovation, entrepreneurship, education and scientific expertise. The USRF primarily supports and funds projects that strengthen partnerships and build understanding in one or more of these key areas: Rule of Law and Governance, Economic Enterprise and Entrepreneurship Development, Civil Society, and Russian and American Studies. Rule of Law and Governance serves as a way for the USRF to focus on laws, institutions, and practices that enable good governance at the local, regional, and national levels. Economic Enterprise and Entrepreneurship Development focuses on practices that build the capacity for private entrepreneurship. Civil Society seeks to find solutions which improve the well-being of communities and citizens. The newly added Russian and American Studies pillar seeks to improve Russian-American mutual expertise and understanding.  Leadership  The President and Chief Executive Officer of USRF is Celeste Wallander, who joined in 2017. Wallander was previously Special Assistant to President Barack Obama and Senior Director for Russia/Eurasia on the National Security Council (2013-2017). Past presidents of USRF include Mark Pomar (2008-2017), former President and CEO of IREX and former Executive Director of the US Board for International Broadcasting. Ambassador John Beyrle serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors (2018‚Äìpresent). Previous chairmen include Ambassador James Collins (2008-2018) and Steve Pease (2008-2018). History= The U.S. Russia Investment Fund (1995-2008)  USRF is the legacy organization of the U.S. Russia Investment Fund (TUSRIF), which was established by the United States government in 1995 pursuant to the Support for East European Democracy Act (SEED) of 1989. It was the result of the merger of two funds established in 1993-1994: the $340-million Russian American Enterprise Fund (RAEF) and the $100-million Fund for Large Enterprises (FLEER). Most of the money came from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Its main goal was to promote investments in Russia. It specialized in \\"early venture, mid venture, and growth capital investments in middle market companies\\", with a focus on the \\"media, retail, consumer goods, financial services, information technology, and telecommunication sectors\\". TUSRIF and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company owned 51% of the Imperial Porcelain Factory until 1999, when it was nationalized by the Government of Russia. In 2000, it established DeltaBank, the first bank to sell Visa credit cards in Russia. In October 2000, it became a majority shareholder of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Meanwhile, they acquired JPMorgan Chase's banking license in 2000 and established DeltaCredit, the first bank to sell residential mortgages in Russia, in 2001. By 2005, TUSRIF had invested $300 million in 44 Russian companies, including the aforementioned DeltaBank and DeltaCredit as well as two television networks. However, DeltaCredit was acquired by the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale for $100 million that year. Meanwhile, TUSRIF also invested in small businesses, for example in Nizhny Novgorod. TUSRIF was replaced by the U.S. Russia Foundation (USRF) in 2008. Three years later, in 2011, the disposal of $150 million from the fund was tabled by the United States Agency for International Development(USAID) and the United States Congress, on the recommendation from the Obama administration that half should go to the United States Department of the Treasury and half to support American values in Russia. By 2012, the Obama administration asked Congress to allocate only $50 million to support human rights non-profit organizations in Russia.  The U.S. Russia Foundation (2008-Present)  The establishment of the U.S Russia Foundation was announced by presidents George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin at the 32nd G8 summit in 2006. It was an outgrowth of The U.S. Russia Investment Fund. It was registered in the United States in 2008 and in Russia in 2009. From 2009 to 2015, USRF operated a Moscow office and established good working relationships with Russian government institutions, including the Ministry of Education, and partnerships with Russian Universities, foundations, and non- governmental organizations. USRF was a member of the Russian Donors Forum and an active participant in Russian international education programs. USRF supported numerous projects in Russia (including the very successful EURECA program established in 2010) by being a co-funder together with Russian institutions. Beginning in 2013, USRF along with other Western organizations came under increasing attack by anti-western Russian organizations and media. By 2015, its CEO, Mark Pomar, was denied entry into Russia. Meanwhile, the organization was declared \\"undesirable\\" by the 2015 Russian undesirable organizations law. Indeed, the Office of the Prosecutor General of Russia, chaired by Yury Chaika, suggested it posed \\"a threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the state¬ës security.\\" The United States Department of State (USDS) responded by saying, \\"We reject the contention that the Foundation's activities constitute a threat to Russia's security. On the contrary, this designation is another deliberate step to further isolate the Russian people from the rest of the world.\\". Nevertheless, the USRF continues its mission to strengthen relations between the United States and Russia and to promote the development of the private sector in the Russian Federation. The USRF is supporting various development programs that build Russian innovation, entrepreneurship, education, and scientific expertise.https://www.usrf.us/about/about-usrf/ After the closure of USRF headquarters in Moscow, the Foundation relocated to Washington, D.C. in 2015.  Project Initiatives  USRF is credited with creating, funding, and running the EURECA Program, a business-oriented university program for US and Russian students. This initiative, backed by American and Russian support, enhanced business and entrepreneurship curricula in Russian universities with the ultimate goal of promoting bilateral development of new technologies and emerging business endeavors. The pilot program was with students from the University of Maryland, College Park and Lobachevsky State University and eventually developed into an official program initiative between ITMO Research University in St. Petersburg and UCLA, leading to the co-founding of the start-up. With the Yegor Gaidar Foundation, it also ran the Gaidar Summer Leadership Program, whereby Russian students spent two weeks at Purdue University to learn about entrepreneurship and start-up companies, and the Improving Economics Instruction, where Russian economists spent two weeks in American universities. It also ran the Economics and Entrepreneurship Experts Forum Program, which encouraged scholarships between American and Russian researchers in economics and entrepreneurship, and the Legal Education Exchange Program, which aimed to share pedagogical methods among American and Russian university instructors. Grant Programs USRF outlines four areas of funding priority to establish target request-for-proposals (RFPs), specifically in areas of Russian and American Studies, Civil Society, and Rule of Law and Governance: * Rule of Law and Governance * Economic Enterprise and Entrepreneurship * Civil Society * Russian and American Studies Contact The U.S. Russia Foundation 1230 17th Street, NW Washington, DC 20036 (202)495-7888 .

It is a type of hot air engine, converting a temperature difference into motion. There is a hot side and a cold side to the engine. Providing there is a large enough temperature difference between the two sides the engine will run. The Manson- Guise engine is probably the simplest type of hot air engines having only a single con-rod, with a displacer piston and power piston that move at the same time. Manson-Guise engines, like Manson engines and beta Stirling engines, can run bidirectionally. Manson-Guise engine  Similarities to Stirling engines  Manson-Guise engines share some similarities with Stirling engines but with two major differences. Firstly with a Stirling engine the air inside is repeatedly heated and cooled. With a Manson-Guise engine the Manson engine draws in and expels air. Secondly a Manson-Guise engine is able to have a single connecting rod and counterintuitively the displacer piston and power piston are on the same shaft and move at the same time.  The Manson-Guise Cycle  At the top dead centre and bottom dead centre, valves open briefly with the rest of the time the valves being closed. Both the displacer piston and power piston move together in the same direction at the same time. At the end of each stroke a valve is opened. This releases pressure or vacuum so the next cycle can begin. The Manson cycle can be summarised into 4 parts: * When heading towards the heat, the displacer piston is shuttling air inside the engine to the cold side, cooling and contracting the air, which in turn pulls on the power piston. * A valve is briefly opened relieving the vacuum pressure. This prepares the engine for the next stroke. The flywheel provides energy to push the engine into the next stroke. * When the pistons are heading away from the heat source the displacer is shuttling air inside the engine to the hot side, expanding the air which builds up pressure and drives the power piston. * A valve is briefly opened relieving the pressure inside the engine. This prepares the engine for the next stroke. The flywheel provides energy to push the engine into the next stroke.  Development  Chris Guise, the workshop manager and engine designer at Kontax Engineering Ltd was developing a Manson engine to add to the existing range of hot air engines the company manufactured and sold. While developing and prototyping a Manson engine he had the idea for an improved the design. After a few design revisions this resulted in a simpler design which reduces production costs and increases performance of the engine due to air having a similar flow.  Public release  The Manson-Guise engine was first shown to the public on 15 Aug 2016 through a kickstarter project launch.  Efficiency  The Manson-Guise engine efficiency has yet to be tested but is expected to be less than the Stirling engine cycle efficiency due to drawing in cold air and expelling hot air.

Near McHenrys Peak and Longs Peak, there are \\"spectacular views\\" of the Continental Divide at the lake. The Bierstadt Lake Trailhead is located about from the turn-off at U.S. Route 36 into the Rocky Mountain National Park. During the summer, shuttle buses provide transportation to the trailhead. The lake sits atop a lateral moraine on the side and end of Bartholf Glacier and drains into Mill Creek. It is named for Albert Bierstadt, a noted landscape artist, whose 1870s paintings of Longs Peak and Bierstadt Lake are among the Denver Art Museum's collection. Geology and hydrology Bierstadt Lake rests on a plateau on the Bierstadt Moraine, which is a \\"massive\\" moraine created by debris left from the receding Bartholf Glacier. The glacier, never more than long, \\"originated on the highest mountain in the park\\". Because it was a steep glacier, \\"its gouging action was vigorous\\". Glacial lobes at Glacier Gorge, Loch Vale, and Flattop Mountain joined and moved iced in Barthlolf Park. Debris trapped in the ice created the Bierstadt Moraine that lies between Glacier and Mill Creeks and is more than wide and is more than above the floor of Bartholf Park. The lake was formed when a dam was made from glacial debris deposits. Water from the lake drains into Mill Creek within the Mill Creek basin, which is a flat valley with a scenic meadow. Author Lisa Foster describes the long glacial ridge as \\"one of the most dramatic lateral moraines in the Rocky Mountain National Park\\". On the north side of the moraine is Hollowell Park and the Mill Creek Basin. The steep south side sits above Bear Creek Road. History Albert Bierstadt, Whyte's Lake, , Estes Park, Colorado. The lake may have been a man- made lake that was washed out in a flood the following year, or what is now known as Bierstadt Lake. It was first called \\"Hanging Lake\\" by Native Americans due to its \\"perched condition\\" on the side of Bartholf Glacier. Bierstadt Lake was officially given its name in 1932, prior to that the name was on a reprinted U.S. Geological Survey map created in 1922. Like Mount Bierstadt, it was named to honor Albert Bierstadt, a landscape artist, who visited and painted the Rocky Mountains. He may have become the first European to visit the summit of Mount Evans when he climbed it in 1863. Mount Evans is from Mount Bierstadt. In 1876, Bierstadt was commissioned by Windham Wyndham- Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl to make an exceptionally large canvas painting of Longs Peak and Estes Park for $15,000, . Bierstadt traveled throughout the area with Theodore Whyte, the earl's associate, and created sketches and paintings. The two men also looked for a suitable site, with a great view of Longs Peak, to construct an English hotel for the earl. Bierstadt took a particular interest in the lake, and Whyte is credited for naming the lake in honor of the artist. He \\"created one of his many spectacular images of the West\\" at the lake. Harold Marion Dunning, an early historian, chronicled \\"that Bierstadt's favorite place for mountain sketches and material for some of his famous paintings was on the shore of the lake that now bears his name\\". Bierstadt created a painting of the lake that would bear his name. The work of art is now in the Denver Art Museum's collection. According to the Buffalo Bill Center of the West, Peter Hassrick thought that Bierstadt's 1877 painting, which has \\"Whyte's Lake\\" written on its back, may have been initially named for Whyte and later renamed for Bierstadt. There is also a claim that Whyte's Lake was a man-made lake that was washed out in a flood the year after the painting was made. By 1907, the Griffith Sawmill near Bierstadt Lake supplied lumber for the farming and ranching settlements that were founded in the area. The lake was situated on the abandoned Mill Creek Road and near the site of the Mill Creek Ranger Station. By 1907, the Griffith Sawmill near Bierstadt Lake supplied lumber for nearby farming and ranching settlements. Sawmills often operated through the winter, conveying lumber with sleds, to meet the construction needs of the settlers and shopkeepers. Women moved into the area by 1910, after many buildings had been constructed. Lumber from the sawmill was used in the construction of The Stanley Hotel. In 1910, Griffith moved their sawmill to a spur of Highway 66 [now U.S. Route 34]. Rocky Mountain National Park Mountains south of Bierstadt Lake The lake is located off of Bear Lake Road in the \\"Heart of the Park,\\" so named because of the great views and easy access. Trail Gazette states that \\"different scenic routes [trails] provide marvelous opportunities for photographic subjects such as scenery, flora and fauna, geographic and geological features.\\" Flora in the area around the lake includes aspen and pine trees. A dense pine forest encircles Bierstadt Lake, and the lake \\"is ringed by sedges that give it a very serene appearance.\\" Fauna in the area are waterfowl, Abert's squirrel, deer and elk. There are two trails, according to the Rocky Mountain National Park, through dense forests that lead to Bierstadt Lake within the park. An easy, mostly downhill trail runs through pine and aspen forests. It begins at Bear Lake Trailhead and runs along Bear Lake. Another is an uphill trail with switchbacks that begins at the Bierstadt Lake Trailhead. About into the trail is a horse corral. Near the lake are Longs Peak, Flattop Mountain, Hallett Peak, and Tyndall Glacier. A trail encircles the subalpine lake, which has a sandy beach along the eastern portion of the lake. The scenic Hollowell Park trail leads to the Bierstadt Lake area through dense sagebrush and meadows on the north side of Bierstadt Moraine and to the Mill Creek Basin. Fern Lake and Cub Lake trails are also in the vicinity. No picnicking or fishing is allowed.

Azerbaijan pays 0.08% of the quotas received by the IMF and holds 0.11% of the total voting power. Since Azerbaijan's induction into the organization, the IMF has implemented several programs in Azerbaijan that foster economic growth and poverty reduction. Between 1995 and 2005, the IMF loaned Azerbaijan $577.3 million in order to provide support for the country's economic reform programs; Azerbaijan was able to fully repay these loans. Projections for Azerbaijan's economy were optimistic in 2012. Inflation was projected to stay in the single digits alongside a projected GDP increase of over 5%. However the country does still have progress to make as Mohammed El Qorchi, the Chief of the IMF's Mission in Azerbaijan, asserted in 2017 that the country needs to speed up the progress on reforming its banking sector so that it is more stable which will in turn generate more trust in the country's economic stability. The IMF is not pushing the banking reforms in any particular direction, but is interested in seeing progress in a positive direction for the country's economy. In 2017, the IMF forecast a 1% growth rate for Azerbaijan. In the same year, during a meeting with IMF officials, representatives from Azerbaijan discussed fiscal consolidation, monetary tightening and the aforementioned banking sector reforms. The possibility of assistance to the Central Bank of Azerbaijan was also discussed. An agreement was reached to hold Article IV consultations in November 2017. Azerbaijan was included in a 2017 IMF outlook report for the Middle East where the IMF believes economic conditions are gradually improving, in part due to a preferable environment emerging in the global community. Despite this, progress will be hampered due to a need for these countries to enact some structural reforms and re-evaluating their positions on fiscal matters.

In the fall he moved to New York to attend the Art Students League. There he studied with John Sloan, who advised him to return to the Southwest where there were \\"a lot of interesting things\\" he could paint, convincing Bywaters to return to Dallas. Artistic career Bywaters produced landscapes, still lifes and portrait paintings, as well as lithographic prints and murals. In 1933 Art Digest recognized Bywaters as an artist of national importance. His paintings in museum collections include On the Ranch (1941) at the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts; Where the Mountain Meets the Plains, at Southern Methodist University; and Oil Field Girls (1940), at the Blanton Museum, University of Texas at Austin. In 1935 Bywaters began making prints using lithography as a way to make art affordable, hoping the middle class could buy them and popularize Texas regional art. He pioneered the style later termed \\"Lone Star Regionalism\\" and he was recognized as \\"one of the finest of the regional print makers\\". An early Bywaters lithograph was Gargantua (1935), which won a prize in the 1935 Allied Arts Exhibition. Another, Ranch Hand and Pony (1938), was exhibited at the 1938 Venice Biennial Exposition. Bywaters was a founding member of Lone Star Printmakers, a group of Texas artists who created editions of original prints which they promoted with touring exhibitions from 1938 to 1941. Bywaters participated in New Deal art programs, winning mural competitions. In collaborations with other Dallas artists he completed six projects in Texas, including a series of panels in collaboration with Alexandre Hogue at the Old City Hall in Dallas; a series of panels at the Paris Public Library; and one mural each in the post offices of Trinity, Quanah, and Farmersville. Other murals were installed at the Parcel Post Building of Houston. Professor, critic, and museum director Bywaters served for forty years as a faculty member of Southern Methodist University's Division of Fine Arts, where he ran both the Art and Art History departments. He was the art director of the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts from 1943 to 1964. Unlike his contemporary art directors, Bywaters sought to bring people into the museum, foreseeing they were key to survival and growth. For example, in 1954 he staged the two-week 'Fabulous West' event which attracted 131,000 people. During his tenure as director of the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts, Bywaters produced ambitious exhibitions, notably the 'Religious Art of the Western World' (1958) and 'The Arts of Man' (1962). When city support for the museum was threatened by accusations that the museum was exhibiting works by communist artists during the Red Scare, Bywaters and the trustees of the Dallas Art Association held fast to the standard of freedom of expression and professionalism. Bywaters was the art critic for The Dallas Morning News from 1933 to 1939 and wrote hundreds of articles on the art and artists of Texas. He was seen as fair, pointing out merits, and allowing shortcomings to be revealed comparison. As editor of the Southwestern Arts and art critic for the Dallas paper, Bywaters was recognized as the leading spokesman of regionalism in Dallas. He was prominent among the circle of artist known as the 'Dallas Nine', or the 'Lone Star Regionalist'. Legacy In 1981, Bywaters gave his numerous papers and clippings on the art and artists of the region to Southern Methodist University, founding the Bywaters Collection on Art of the Southwest. Bywaters lived in Dallas with his wife Mary McLarry Bywaters until his death on March 7, 1989.

The episode was written by Alan DiFiore, and was directed by Steven DePaul. Plot Opening quote: \\"You shall not become corrupt, you shall not become putrid, you shall not become worms.\\" In Portland University, workmen are knocking down walls and find a secret room in one of them. In the room, they find an old Egyptian crate and they call Vera Gates (Anne Dudek), a professor, to study it. They open the crate to find the sarcophagus of Anubis, the God of mummification and afterlife. Meanwhile, Wu (Reggie Lee) continues to be haunted after his encounter with the Aswang. Karl Herman (Richard Lee Jackson) and Bob Taylor (Rafael Miguel) learn of the sarcophagus and that night, sneak into the university to steal it. However, they are found by university security guards; Herman manages to kill one of them but Bob dies of his wounds. Nick (David Giuntoli) and Hank (Russell Hornsby) are later called to investigate the murder, finding symbols spray- painted on the wall, reading \\"I protect the dead\\". Back in Austria, Sebastien (Christian Lagadec) is brought before prince Viktor (Alexis Denisof), who asks for the names of the people who helped Adalind (Claire Coffee) escape. Meisner (Damien Puckler) finds a baby in the woods and brings it back to the cabin but finds Adalind with the baby and that what he brought were just logs. Nick and Hank find that Herman is wanted for multiple crimes and is known for sneaking into the museums, as he is not in favor of them keeping the dead. They go to Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) and Rosalee (Bree Turner) to seek help, deducing that Herman is a Wesen that works for the Beati Paoli, a Wesen group that wants to preserve their culture. Monroe wants to inform the Wesen Council about it but Rosalee is certain that they already know. Nick, Hank and Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) find a reel film in the trailer showing a Grimm interrogating an Anubis Wesen. They deduce that Herman is an Anubis and wants to steal the mummy from the university. Nick and Hank warn Gates but she doesn't listen. Nick goes to Monroe's house and finds Alexander (Spencer Conway) there. Alexander explains that while the Council has no problems with the Beati Paoli, the members want Herman dead after murdering the security guard and want Nick to kill him as he is a Grimm. Nick refuses although Alexander warns that Herman could go after Gates at any moment. Sebastien is tortured in a variety of methods and finally tells them where he left Adalind and Meisner, resulting in the Verrat agents setting off to find them in the woods. Renard (Sasha Roiz) calls Meisner and voices his concern that Sebastien hasn't been contacted and makes arrangements for them to leave the country. The Verrat agents find the cabin while Adalind, Meisner and the baby are escaping. Herman holds Gates at knifepoint and forces her to help him enter the university and lead him to the mummy. Nick and Hank arrive and attack Herman. Nick manages to defeat him and arrest him. Nick finds Alexander with the mummy in his car and confronts him about the lies but decides not to intervene. Nick, Hank, Monroe, Rosalee and Alexander hold a ceremony where they cremate the mummy. The episode ends as Wu is finally being let out of the hospital, believing everything was in his head.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade and wrote, \\"Maybe Grimm has a problem with establishing the scale of fright inflicted upon humans who see something they can't explain. Drew Wu hears stories from his grandmother in the Philippines about an Aswang, then has a deep personal connection to a case where he encounters one of the creatures, can't explain what he sees, and goes so far off the deep end he checks himself into a mental facility. But this week, an archaeology professor discovers that a mummified Anubis Wesen exists, hitting upon a professional discovery that could change her field forever, gets attacked by a living Wesen that goes woge in front of her ‚Äî and Nick easily convinces her to chalk it up to stress at work.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"The case this week is one of the more interesting ones with the Anubis, as we watched the gang discuss what to do with the Beati Pauli and Council. This installment really cements the fact that Nick, Monroe, Rosalee and Hank are their own team first; traditions come second when it comes to loyalty.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman from TV.com, wrote, \\"I love it when I issue demands and TV just obeys. However, I can't help but worry that he's eventually going to discover the (real) truth, at which point he's going to be pissed and probably resent Nick and Hank a little bit for letting him think he was crazy. It's okay, though. Wu has always been kind of a lighthearted character ‚Äî one of the few on Grimm ‚Äî and strapping this ticking time-bomb to him adds a mucho appreciated layer to the character and the potential stories involving him.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:Grimm (season 3) episodes Category:2014 American television episodes ","title":"Once We Were Gods"},{"id":"52119680","text":"Kamilla Asylova (born 14 September 1998) is a Kazakhstani model who was crowned Miss Universe Kazakhstan 2016 and represented Kazakhstan at Miss Universe 2017.

It was part of the post-movement started by Caifanes, and it was one of the bands that followed its principles, along with Santa Sabina, , Fobia, El Tri, and Man√°, among others. Its biggest success was the 1989 single El Final.

Arturo Ybarra, then guitar player of the groups Mask and TRAX and Agust√≠n Villa (Cala), singer for the Los Clips project and Rock'n Pills, formed a group that would reflect their lives, their dreams, their loves, their heartbreaks and their disappointments as young men. This new project was named Montana, after a brand of cigars. The magic of Montana was expressed in its first disc, 1985's Quiero m√°s on the WEA label, showing a fresh style, light and enveloping, a disc with releases like Quiero m√°s and Quisiera que estuvieras aqu√≠. The music of the period can be found on the 1984 Comrock WEA album, which featured Ritmo Peligroso, , Kenny y los El√©ctricos, Mask and Los Clips.

This production had the participation of Alejandra Guzm√°n, Andr√©s Calamaro and Kenny, and they began to play across the country with much recognition. Then the group took a break and the leaders of the band decided to start separate projects. Arturo recorded a gospel disc titled Luz aquella, and Cala put out a solo project called Con huevos y cajeta (1994). Aleks Syntek Caifanes in Zacatecas in 2012 En 1997, at the request of the label, they decided to get together again as Rostros Ocultos and put out Dame una raz√≥n. They recorded Disparado, Abre tu coraz√≥n, M√∫sicos, poetas y locos and Dame una raz√≥n on the EMI label. With these productions, they left an indelible mark on rock en espa√±ol.

This release included an interactive CD, with highlights from the career of Hugo S√°nchez and the history of Rostros Ocultos.

In Italy she appeared in the title role of Verdi's \\"Luisa Miller\\" in Naples in 1851 and created roles in operas by Errico Petrella and Giovanni Bottesini. In 1853 she created the leading soprano role of Leonora in Giuseppe Verdi's hugely successful opera \\"Il trovatore\\". She had appeared in Trieste the previous year as Azucena in \\"Il trovatore\\" by Francesco Cortesi, based on the same Spanish play as Verdi's opera. Verdi prized her for her combination of vocal agility with fervid dramatic commitment. The composer recommended her for the leading soprano roles of his subsequent operas \\"La traviata\\" and \\"Un ballo in maschera\\", saying that Penco had much spirit and a good stage presence. She subsequently appeared as Amelia in \\"Un ballo in maschera\\" at Covent Garden and the Th√©√¢tre Italien, Paris. Rosina Penco was praised for her sweetness of voice combined with highly dramatic acting and vocal agility. Her success in the leading role of Leonora in the enormously popular opera \\"Il trovatore\\" led to further engagements in the top opera houses in London, Paris, Berlin, Madrid and Saint Petersburg. In 1858 however Verdi lamented that Penco had lost the fire that had distinguished her earlier appearances and had retreated into an old-fashioned manner of singing and performance like that of thirty years earlier. Penco retired from the stage in 1875.

Willie \\"Poor Boy\\" Lofton (1905 ‚Äì 1962) was an American Delta blues singer-guitarist. He recorded eight sides for Decca Records and Bluebird Records, adopting a style strikingly similar to Tommy Johnson's. Lofton never achieved much commercial success or recognition in his lifetime, but his rendition of Johnson's \\"Big Road Blues\\" has been revitalized on compilation albums. Not much is known about Lofton's personal life, although musician Plastic Crimewave, writing in his column The Secret History of Chicago Music, stated that Lofton most likely was born in Florence, Mississippi sometime in 1905. He worked as a barber in Jackson and also played the blues, performing regularly with influential Delta blues musicians Tommy Johnson and Ishmon Bracey. Johnson, in particular, was hugely impactful on Lofton's own style, as he soon adopted Johnson's fast-paced staccato guitar playing and falsetto singing. Lofton relocated to Chicago in 1934, recording and releasing the songs \\"Poor Boy Blues\\" and \\"It's Killin' Me\\" on Decca Records, with two additional songs from the session released in early 1935. In January 1935, he recorded \\"Dirty Mistreater\\" and \\"Rainy Day Blues\\", the former of which adopted guitar lines from Johnson. Lofton may have also been an uncredited guitarist for recordings completed by Kansas Joe McCoy later in the year. In November 1935, Lofton recorded his two most highly regarded songs of his brief recording career with pianist Black Bob Hudson on Bluebird Records, \\"Beer Garden Blues\\" and a rendition of Johnson's \\"Big Road Blues\\", retitled \\"Dark Road Blues\\". Plastic Crimewave praised Lofton's rewritten lyrics on \\"Dark Road Blues\\" as a \\"part of the DNA of the entire blues tradition\\". In 1942, Lofton returned to Jackson without achieving much commercial success from his records. He reportedly died in 1962. Lofton's work has been released numerous times on Mississippi Delta blues compilation albums as early as 1964, including Dark Road Blues, Jackson Blues 1928-1938, Mississippi Blues, Volume 2, and Tommy Johnson and Associates. His interpretation of Johnson's \\"Big Road Blues\\" is also noted as the only known cover version of the song even though it was a standard among Delta blues musicians who associated with Johnson.

It can be active, middle or passive and can be used in the present, future, aorist and perfect tense; these tenses normally represent not absolute time but only time relative to the main verb of the sentence.William Watson Goodwin, Syntax of the Moods and Tenses of the Greek Verb, by ¬ß¬ß 138 ff.William Watson Goodwin, Syntax of the Moods and Tenses of the Greek Verb, ¬ß¬ß 187 ff. In general, as it shows no personal endings, its main use is to express an action or situation that accompanies the action or situation expressed by the main verb.Rijksbaron, Albert, The syntax and semantics of the verb in classical Greek, The University of Chicago Press, 2006, p. 95 and pp. 116 ff. Terminology The Greek grammarians called a participle a ŒºŒµœÑŒøœáŒÆ 'participation, share', because it shares the properties of a verb and of an adjective. Latin calqued the word as participium, from which English gets participle.  Uses of the participle  Three main syntactic uses of the participle can be distinguished: (a) the participle as a modifier of a noun (attributive participle) (b) the participle used as an obligatory argument of a verb (supplementary participle), (c) the participle as an adverbial satellite of a verbal predicate (circumstantial or adverbial participle).William Watson Goodwin, Syntax of the Moods and Tenses of the Greek Verb, ¬ß¬ß 821 ff. The attributive participle  The attributive participle is often, though not always,William Watson Goodwin, Syntax of the Moods and Tenses of the Greek Verb, ¬ß 827. used with the article (which can be either generic or particular); it functions as a common adjective, it can be in every tense stem, and it is on a par with ‚Äì and thus often translated as ‚Äì a relative clause. It shows agreement with a noun, present or implied, in a sentence, and can be assigned any syntactic role an adjective can hold. :: Thucydides, 8.68.1 :: The man who spoke this opinion was Pisander. Like any adjective it can be used substantively (or be nominalized) by omission of an understood noun (easily recoverable from the context): :: Apollodorus, Epit. 6.16 :: Whoever (= any man or soldier who) wants to go home‚Ä¶ :: Plato, Phaedrus 117a :: He came back bringing the (man/one) who was going to give the poison. Many participles of this sort are equivalent to ‚Äì and thus translated as ‚Äì nouns, e.g.: :: = the person put on exile, or the person accused, i.e. the exile, or the defendant :: = the thing that is going to happen, i.e. the future :: = the person that steals, i.e. the thief An adverbial notion may be inherent in an attributive participle; the usual notions are those of purpose or consequence (in the future tense), and condition (in all tense stems but the future, with negative ŒºŒÆ). The following example has a future participle indicating purpose: :: Demosthenes, 21.49 :: They have publicly enacted this specific law to prevent these things.  The supplementary participle  The supplementary participle is always without the article (predicative position of the participle is employed) and can be in any tense stem. This participle has two major uses: (1) in indirect discourse, and (2) not in indirect discourse. =The supplementary participle in indirect statements = When in this use, the participle corresponds to a particular tense and mood of a simple indicative of any tense, and, if accompanied by the particle ·ºÑŒΩ, to potential optative or potential indicative. Verbs taking such a participial clause as an object complement are: i) Verbs of perceiving, knowing, discovering, remembering and so on such as: \\"see that\\", \\"hear that\\", \\"perceive, notice that\\", \\"come to know, perceive, realize that\\", \\"not to know\\", \\"find (on arrival) that\\", \\"find that\\", \\"catch, detect someone doing something\\" (passive: ), \\"learn, know that\\", \\"know that\\", \\"know (as a witness), or be conscious that\\", \\"understand that\\", \\"consider that\\" \\"remember that\\", \\"forget that\\". ii) Verbs of presentation, i.e. verbs meaning '\\"announce, show, prove\\"' such as: \\"report that\\", (·ºÄœÄŒø-, ·ºêœÄŒπ-) \\"show, explain, point out that\\", \\"prove that\\". :: Plato, Apology 27c :: I assume that you agree, since you don‚Äôt give any reply. :: Xenophon, Constitution of Sparta 14.3 :: And I know too that in the past they were afraid to be seen in possession of gold. In many of the above cases this participle is interchangeable with a clause introduced by ·ΩÖœÑŒπ or ·Ω°œÇ, for example: :: Isocrates, 14.7 :: For who does not know that they (the Thebans) have portioned out our land for grazing and have razed our city to the ground? The following case constructions are available for such a supplementary participle: a. The logical \\"subject\\" of the participle and the grammatical subject of the governing verb are coreferential, the participle being put in the nominative case, agreeing with it (we are dealing with a so-called nominative plus participle construction; see also nominative and infinitive): :: :: They see [that they are in no position to get the upper hand]. :: Direct form: We are in no position to get the upper hand. b. The supplementary participle modifies a noun phrase as if it were a \\"subject\\" of its own (there is no coreference) and both the participle and this noun are put in the accusative case, just like an accusative and infinitive construction. This is the case where the argument of the verb is not the noun, even though it seems to be a real accusative object, but the verbal notion expressed by the participle itself:Rijksbaron, Albert. The syntax and semantics of the verb in classical Greek. University of Chicago Press, 2006, p. 118, note 2. :: :: I understand [that some people break the laws. Independent/direct speech form: \\"\\" Some people break the law. :: :: He proved [that Lysander killed Philocles]. Independent form: \\"\\" Lysander killed Philocles. In each of the above sentences, if the participle is taken away, then the remaining construction is ungrammatical, considering that each governing verb retains its initial meaning. This proves that the noun or pronoun is an argument of the participle only, rather than of the verb.Rijksbaron, Albert. The syntax and semantics of the verb in classical Greek. The University of Chicago Press, 2006, p. 118, Note 1 Speaking in modern linguistic terms, this is a case of exceptional case marking (ECM), and verbs allowing that are called raising-to-object ones. However, with verbs like \\"see\\", \\"hear\\", \\"find\\", there is another possible construction that does not involve indirect speech, but is a mere description of a sensory input: :: Lysias, 1.24 :: Those of us who entered first saw him still lying beside my wife, those who came later saw him standing naked on the bed. (Not: We saw [that he was lying].) : :: Plato, Symposium 194d :: I am happy to hear Socrates (when he is) having a discussion. (Not: I hear [that he is discussing].) In the above sentences and are second arguments of the verbs and respectively, while the participles are added as their third arguments (in modern linguistic terms called (verbal) secondary predicates or small clauses). Here by no means can any ECM phenomenon be attributed. Even further, with such verbs as , which normally take an object in the genitive denoting the source producing a sound, the distinction between the two types of construction is clear. Compare the above example, where is in the genitive case, with the one below, where is in the accusative case: :: Xenophon, Anabasis 1.4.5 :: He heard [that Cyrus was in Cilicia]. = The supplementary participle not in indirect discourse = When this participle is used not in indirect discourse, the following constructions are possible: i) It is part of a predicate formed out by a copula verb, used mostly as an auxiliary verb; such verbs are: ‚Äúbe‚Äù, ‚Äúbecome‚Äù, rarely ‚Äúhappen to be‚Äù. :: :: The children take after their parents. ii) It forms a predicate with a quasi-copular verb that expresses a way of being, like , \\"be manifest\\", \\"be hidden, unobserved, unseen, unnoticed, unaware\\", \\"be gone, away or absent\\", \\"happen to be\\", \\"be beforehand with\\". Semantically, with all these verbs it is the participle itself that expresses the main action, while in many cases the quasi-copular verb qualifies this action almost like an adverbial constituent. :: :: He was after all in the very moment no better in intellect than a tadpole, to say nothing of being better than any other man. :: :: It was evident that he wanted to come/ Evidently he wanted to come. All these verbs always have a grammatical subject that is corefential with the logical subject of the participle; only the verbs and may have an appended accusative object, as a third argument of the verb, denoting the person from whom someone/something is kept hidden or the person that someone overtakes in the action expressed by the participle. :: :: He left without being noticed by him. :: :: Lysander was beforehand with Pausanias in coming to Aliartus/ Lysander came to Aliartus before Pausanias. NOTE: some of those verbs (such as verbs of presentation: ) may also be used as governing verbs in indirect discourse supplemented either by a participle or a clausal construction introduced by the particles ·ΩÖœÑŒπ or ·Ω°œÇ. iii) It is the complement of verbs denoting commencement, continuation (patience, tolerance) or termination (fatigue) of an action, and it is always in the present tense stem; such verbs are: \\"begin, take the initiative in\\", \\"start, begin\\", \\"cause to cease, stop from\\", \\"cease, stop\\", \\"leave off, cease\\", \\"give up\\", \\"be tired or weary\\", \\"spend my whole life\\", , , , , \\"continue, keep up\\", \\"tolerate\\", \\"overlook\\". With these verbs the participle‚Äôs logical subject is coreferent with the verb‚Äôs grammatical subject, if there is no object in the structure, or else with the object, and the participle agrees in case (nominative or accusative) with this word. :: :: I will start teaching about god. :: :: I don't tolerate you insulting me. : :: He stopped your allies from revolting from you. iv) A supplementary participle can be used with verbs expressing passions of the soul, such as \\"be vexed\\", \\"be ashamed\\", \\"be pleased\\", \\"be happy\\", \\"be sorry\\", \\"get angry\\". :: :: I am glad to see you healthy. :: :: He is vexed tolerating the insults. v) Finally, it is used with some verbs not easy to classify: \\"behave well, honourably, fairly, badly\\", \\"gratify, favour\\", \\"do wrong\\", \\"defeat\\", \\"prevail, survive\\", \\"have the better of\\", \\"be worsted by\\", \\"be left behind, fall short\\". :: :: You are doing well by taking care of the old men.  The circumstantial (adverbial) participle  The circumstantial participle, used as a satellite of another verbal form, is always without the article (i.e. it is put in the predicative position). It is added as a modifier to a noun or pronoun to denote the circumstance(s) under which the action of another verbal form (a finite verb or an infinitive/another participle) takes place. The action of the main verb is the main one. It is also called adverbial because it qualifies the main verb like any other adverb, adverbially used adjective, adverbial prepositional phrase, adverbial clause or supplementary predicate. In most of the cases it has the force of a dependent clause denoting time, cause, purpose, supposition, opposition, concession. Often it denotes manner-means or any other attendant circumstance. Two main constructions can be distinguished: i) the participle as a modifier agrees in case (and most of the times in gender and number) with a noun or pronoun that is an argument of the main verb, usually subject, direct or indirect object or dative of interest of any kind. In this case the logical subject of the participle is coreferent to that verbal argument (participium conjuctum). ii) participial phrases, composed by the participle and a quasi-subject noun phrase; such structures form a full new predicate, additional to the verbal predicate: a so-called absolute construction. It is so called because case marking of the whole construction stands \\"loosened, separated, free\\" from the verbal (or other) argumentation Two subtypes can be distinguished: (1) Genitive absolute: the participle modifies a noun or pronoun (as if its \\"subject\\") that stands in the genitive case; in this construction normally the word serving as the logical subject of the participle has no coreference to any other verbal argument, especially the subject. But exceptions are found. (2) Accusative absolute: it is found when the verb in which the participle belongs is impersonal or so used, or when it is an impersonal expression; in this case the subject of the participle is usually an infinitive, as it would be if an impersonal verb in some finite mood was used. This kind of participle is always put in the neuter gender, modifying a neuter noun, as an infinitive really is. Nevertheless, it is also possible for a personal verb‚Äôs participle to stand with its noun in the accusative absolute construction, if only it is preceded by the particles or and expresses cause or conditional comparison respectively. =Use of tenses= Normally all circumstantial participles, according to the grammatical tense stem used for their morphological formation, express only time relative to that of the main verb, but they always express stage of action. Nevertheless, the future stem is only used for denoting purpose, and seldom for denoting future cause (in the latter case normally the particle precedes the participle). =Kinds of circumstantial participlesTemporal :* The temporal participle is used in the present or in the aorist tense stem (the perfect being fairly rare). It expresses a simultaneous or an anterior action. It is sometimes found with temporal adverbs such as \\"while, simultaneously\\", \\"then\\", \\"after\\", \\"immediately\\", \\"already\\", \\"meanwhile\\". :: Xenophon, Hellenica 2.2.2 :: After sailing to Lampsacus he set about repairing the ships. :: :: They were singing the paean while they were sailing. :* The causal participle is used with every tense stem (rarely future when preceded by the particle ·Ω°œÇ). :: :: As I saw that they were sad I promised to write the letter. :: :: As I know that you are competent, I am not afraid. Causal Some particles may precede a causal participle: : a. , , , , , : the reason/cause is presented by the speaker, narrator, or writer as an independent fact (objective reason/cause): :: :: As in fact such a calamity had been unusual with the Lacedaemonians, there was great mourning throughout the Laconian army. : b. : the reason/cause is presented as an idea, thought or personal opinion of the subject of the main verb (subjective cause or reason). :: :: They found fault with Pericles, on the belief/ground that he had persuaded them to engage in the war. Purpose The final (telic) participle (expresses purpose) is used with the future tense stem. It forms the negation with ŒºŒÆ. If the participle is modifying a verb that expresses movement, then it usually stands alone. If the verb does not express a movement then the participle is often found with the particle (in this case the intention of the subject is underlined as a personal consideration, and in many cases it is difficult to determine whether this participle is final or causal). :: :: He left in order to announce the events. :: :: He lies in order to hide the truth. (or causal: on the belief that he will hide the truth) :: :: He sent Aristotle in order for him to announce the agreements (Aristotle will announce). Conditional The conditional participle is used in all tense stems except the future (negated by ŒºŒÆ). It stands as the protasis (:hypothesis) of a conditional sentence, the main verb being the apodosis. It can express any type of conditional thought, but is by far more often used alongside with potential moods or future indicative (and future-like expressions), expressing any kind of future condition. :: (= ). :: That might well happen to you now if you do not listen to us. Concessive The concessive participle (denotes opposition, concession, or limitation) may be preceded by the particles , , , , (= although) or/and followed by (= nevertheless) in the main verb structure. :: :: Agesilaus, although he was aware of those things, nevertheless he continued to be steadfast in the truce. Attendant circumstances A participle may also express any other attendant circumstance under which an action takes place: :: :: Having taken the Boeotians with them, they marched against Pharsalus.

In 1941, elections were held for the Mayor of Wellington and fifteen city councillors plus seats on the Wellington Hospital Board and Wellington Harbour Board. The polling was conducted using the standard first-past-the-post electoral method. Background While residents as well as ratepayers had been able to vote in local elections since 1910, in this election tenants of state houses throughout New Zealand were made borough electors as though they were ratepayers (though they did not pay rates directly to councils, which were paid by central government). This meant that there was no qualifying period of residence for them, though they did not acquire the ratepayers' right to vote on loan or rating proposals. The 'Nathan Incident' The election resulted in a landslide victory for the right-leaning local ticket the Citizens' Association with their candidates capturing all council seats and the mayoralty, blitzing the Labour Party. This resulted from a scandal involving Hubert Nathan, a Citizens candidate for the Wellington Harbour Board and a stockbroker. Like other Citizens candidates, he had been critical of the number of union secretaries on the Labour ticket, asking how they could serve ratepayers and the city while dependent on the unions for their jobs. Nathan agreed to a visit on Friday 9 May by a union official and an associate, but that afternoon five men called and used \\"Gestapo tactics\\" according to Nathan. They reviling him because he was a Jew and saying no Jew should hold any public position, as well as saying they would stop him travelling or getting deliveries unless he apologised and withdrew in writing. On Wednesday 14 May after four days his account was splashed over the papers, giving the unions little time to respond. The Labour Representation Committee said his accusations were \\"hardly credible\\" but newspaper editorials condemned the use of union power to victimise opponents. No Labour candidate was returned to any of the three authorities, though McKeen (as highest polling unsuccessful candidate) was appointed to the Council in 1942 to fill a vacancy caused by Len McKenzie's death. It was nine years before a Labour candidate was again elected to the Council. The Citizens' clean sweep included Elizabeth Gilmer an active conservationist and daughter of Richard Seddon. Labour also lost all seats on the Wellington Hospital Board, although the board still had Labour representatives from MƒÅkara, Petone and Johnsonville.

The local domain of the Ohori is South-eastern Benin north of Pob√® town expanding westwards to and west of the Ou√©m√© River. Often, Ohoris, together with groups of Ifonyis, Aworis and Ketus are known collectively as 'Nagos\\" in Benin. Geography Ohori areas are bound by various Yoruba subgroups to the North, East and South. Egbados (Yewas) are to be found towards the East, the Ifonyis bound them to the South, while to their Northern boundary are the Ketus. They are bounded by the Gbe speaking Fon/Mahi group towards the West. History The Ohori natural environment is a naturally swampy/marshy waterlogged depression (Kumi swamp) with what could be described as adverse physical conditions, therefore the area had historically been a safe haven for people fleeing persecution from the larger entities of Ketu, Oyo and others. Because of their relative inaccessibility during the rainy season, the Ohori were considered by their neighbours to be among the most conservative Yoruba, and their speech is quite distinct. By the 19th century, Ohori area fell under an area of French colonial ambitions. Unfavorable policies by the French led to an Ohori uprising. By 1914, there was a full- scale rebellion against French rule. The rebellion was brutally crushed and Ohori-Ije the main town was totally destroyed. After that, a large population of Ohori began mass migrations to the British-ruled Nigeria to the east. By their own classifications the Ohoris can be subdivided into two groups: The Ohori-Ije who live in the great samps between Ipobe and Ketu, and the Ohori- Ketu who can be destribed as the 'drylanders' Dialect The local Ohori speech is known as Ede Ije which is mutually intelligible to speakers of other dialectal forms of Yoruba. According to Ethnologue, Ede Ije has a 91% lexical similarity with Ede Nago, and an 85% similarity with spoken Yoruba of Porto- Novo.https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ijj Although even more dialectal levelling is taking place among the Ohori with increasing social and geographical mobility, as they become more exposed to more popular forms of Yoruba, as well as through increasing Education and Media exposure.

Theme Director Jose Javier Reyes said, Production On April 13, 2016, Reyes announced that he would direct the film. In addition, lead star Ai-Ai delas Alas posted a photo of the ensemble cast on Instagram, confirming the appearances of Zoren Legaspi, Megan Young, Sofia Andres, and two child actors Lucas Magallano and Alyson McBride in the film. The film was originally titled as My Mighty Yaya. During a press conference in May 2017, Reyes said he wrote the screenplay after receiving a Facebook message from the granddaughter of his dying childhood nanny, asking him to pay her a visit. Marketing Our Mighty Yayas official trailer was released on April 18, 2017 by Regal Entertainment. As of April 27, the film's Facebook page has generated 1.5 million views. Release Our Mighty Yaya was originally planned as Regal's official competing entry at the 2016 Metro Manila Film Festival, an annual film festival held every December in the Philippines. The producers, however (led by Roselle Monteverde), failed to reach the deadline for submission of the film's picture lock version on November 2, as per MMFF's requirement. Rather, another film distributed by Regal, Mano Po 7: Tsinoy, was locked in to compete for the MMFF. The film had its premiere on May 10, 2017. Reception Reception for Our Mighty Yaya has been negative upon release, with critics noting its tired and clich√©d plot as well as its stock characters. Oggs Cruz of Rappler called it \\"a movie that has given up in both originality and ambition,\\" as well as \\"unapologetically generic and predictable,\\" and a \\"humdrum and routinary to really be memorably entertaining.\\" Furthermore, Cruz opined that the film merely serves as a starring vehicle for Ai-Ai delas Alas. Philbert Dy of The Neighborhood felt similarly, while also taking notice of unconvincing performances by Megan Young and delas Alas; he gave an overall rating of 2.5 out of 5.

Tarquin recorded Soft Touch in London once again with producer Ernie McKone, bass player from the UK acid jazz band Galliano. Once the tracks were all recorded, Instinct didn't want to keep the live playing on the album. This was due mainly because one of the A&R; people attended a Radio & Records conference, and had noted that radio was playing programmed grooves. So two other producers Tony Campbell and Chris Ingram were brought in to program the songs and re-record everything. Despite the setbacks, this was another commercially successful album as Smooth Jazz radio embraced the featured single, Darlin Darlin Baby, originally recorded by The O'Jays. Another single from the album, Tangled Web, was a very big radio hit as well, becoming #1 in the New York City market on CD101.9 as well as reaching # 9 nationwide on the Smooth Jazz radio charts. Tarquin also covered another Jeff Beck song, You Know What I Mean. In lieu of the experience, Tarquin came away from the recording very discourage. The indecisiveness of the record company switching between three different producers, became a frustrating ordeal. Instinct was becoming too concerned with radio approval and less with the actual music. This period planted seeds for the future musical endeavors Tarquin would under take in the coming years.

He was curate of Shenstone, Staffordshire and is known for his book The History and Antiquities of Shenstone. Life Sanders was born in Dudley, where he was baptized on 16 January 1727. He was the son of Henry Rogers Sanders, an apothecary, and his wife Rebecca (Hawkes). His father's mother, Sarah, was daughter of Thomas Rogers, a Stourbridge glass dealer who was an ancestor of the poet Samuel Rogers. He was educated partly at the expense of his father's elder brother Thomas, a surgeon who was patronized by George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton. He was educated at Dudley grammar school, and from 1746 at Oriel College, Oxford where he was a servitor; he graduated B.A. in 1750. In 1754, having been ordained, he became curate, on modest pay, of Wednesbury. In the same year he married Elizabeth Butler, daughter of John Butler of Wednesbury. Sanders became curate at Shenstone, Staffordshire in 1755, where he served for fourteen years. His amiable qualities enabled him to make influential friends there, and he always expressed gratitude towards the place and its people. His last entry in the Shenstone register is dated 22 January 1770. Shortly afterwards he accepted an ushership at King Edward's School, Birmingham. By the favour of his uncle's patron, Lord Lyttelton, Sanders was appointed to the mastership of Halesowen school in 1771. Dr. Pynson Wilmot, vicar of Halesowen, formerly a master of Dudley grammar school, obtained for him the perpetual curacy of Oldbury. He died in Halesowen in January 1785, and was buried by his special request in the churchyard of Shenstone on 4 February of that year. His wife had died in 1759. Their only son, John Butler Sanders (1750‚Äì1830), a curate in parishes in London, was an untiring supporter of the Royal Humane Society. Publication Sanders devoted his spare time to writing The History and Antiquities of Shenstone. It was published in 1794 by John Nichols, with a short account of the author by his son. It is a model parish history, containing elaborate accounts of the local manors, hamlets, farms, genealogies, and assessments.

Initial members Among others for the members of the original Sisters Keepers were Nadja Benaissa, Ay·ªç, Kaye, Nicole Hadfield (), and Tamika, along with Tesiree, Lisa, Mamadee, Pat and Meli (Skills en Masse, Ischen Impossible) with Onejiru (Pielina Schindler). \\"Liebe Und Verstand\\" was their largest hit on chart in Germany, Switzerland and Austria between December 2001 to February 2002, as many African artists joined together to form a musical statement. With two songs, both released on the album Lightkultur by Brothers Keepers (WEA), they took a stand against racism and violence. \\"Sisters eV\\" against racism and violence Actually, the members held positions among loose circle of network of female singers, or sisters. Starting in 2004, the \\"Sisters eV\\" functioned with emphasis on activities for gender equality as well as protest against violence and racism, and environmental issues that Onejiru and Mamadee took the initiative. Among the list of female singers they worked with, Ngosi Madubuko and Angela Ordu are from Siberian music, who were two of the supporters close to the group. In 2005, Sisters Keepers was renamed to \\"Sisters\\", and acted independent from Brothers Keepers there on. The Sisters started with Onejiru, Mamadee, Meli, Namusoke, Tamika and Nicole Hadfield (Groove Guerilla) and Lisa Cash coming in and out, and they represented North Rhine-Westphalia at the Bundesvision Song Contest 2008 to claim he fourteenth place with \\"Unite\\".

During their visit to NYC, the Sisters performed at the BB King Blues Club in NY.  Brothers Keepers and Sisters Keepers  It is evident that there is an absence of female musicians in most music videos by the Sisters' brother band, Brothers Keepers. Many saw this as an absence from Afro-German volk envisioned by the Brothers and as drawing attention to the constitutive female outside of this mode of racial unity. The Brothers success and overbearing presence in music videos authorizes this female version of Afro- Germaness, forcefully visually transforming to hegemonic codes of femininity. Within it, there is a strong desire to envisage collectivity beyond peoplehood and the simultaneous failure to do so in Afro-German pop music and diaspora discourse underlines the nagging pervasiveness of this category and pressing need for alternatives.

He was distinguished in his military and political career, striving for justice, equality and fair government in the positions he held. Early life and career Lemery was born in Madrid, Spain on 2 December 1811 to Nicolas Lemery y Ney and Genera Ibarrola y Gonzalez. He served as the chief military officer of the Spanish Royal Family, particularly as adjutant of Francis, Duke of Cadiz. In 1848, he married Flora Ferrer y Alvarez Torres. Their children were Mar√≠a Flora de Lemery y Ferrer, Marquesa de Baroja (born 1849), Manuela Lemery y Ferrer Ibarrola (born 1852), and Isabel Lemery y Ferrer Ibarrola (born 1861). In 1854, he succeeded Joaqu√≠n Francisco Pacheco y Guti√©rrez-Calder√≥n as Deputy of Baleares. In 1855, he was appointed by Queen Isabel II of Spain as Governor of Puerto Rico, where he succeeded Andr√©s Garc√≠a Camba. Before holding these offices, he had a brief stint in Cuba (1850‚Äì1852), wherein he was appointed as commanding general of the colonial armed forces. This appointment was done with the help of his friend, Jos√© Guti√©rrez de la Concha, 1st Marquis of Havana, who was then serving as Governor of Cuba. He was known to have employed harsh policies in suppressing an \\"impending rebellion.\\" Among those who were arrested out of suspicion was Joaqu√≠n de Ag√ºero, who would lead a rebellion in 1851. In 1858, he was promoted lieutenant general and was elected senator for life (senador vitalicio) in the Senate of Spain. Administration of the Philippines On 2 February 1861, while still serving as senator, Lemery began his term as Governor-General of the Philippines. One of the more known reforms during the Lemery administration was the creation of politico-military districts in Visayas and Mindanao pursuant to a royal decree in 1860. This organization was made possible by the relative peace being experienced by the archipelago at the time. In addition, the separation of executive and judicial functions exercised by alcaldes and gobernadorcillos were also implemented. However, this was not done in full measure until 1885, during the term of Emilio Terrero y Perinat. The primary purpose of these reforms was to improve the conditions in the colony to the local level, but friar influence dampened their impact. The lack of continuity in the implementation also contributed to the slow reception of reforms in the local level. The province of Manila was organized and a governor installed. As for Mindanao, wherein the Spaniards had launched a number of military campaigns in the first half of the 19th century, it was divided into six districts. The Central District would serve as the capital of the government organized in Mindanao, and its administrator known as the Governor of Mindanao. The division of politico-military districts in Mindanao were as follows: *First: Zamboanga District, which includes all of Sibugay Bay, and the west coast of Mindanao as far as Murcielagos Island *Second: District of the North, which includes all territory north of Mindanao between the boundary line of the First District and Dapitan Point, on Tutwan Bay *Third: Eastern District, which includes territory between Dapitan Point and Karaga Bay *Fourth: Davao District, which includes the Bay of Davao and all of southern Mindanao from the boundary of the Third District *Fifth: Central District, which includes Illana Bay, and all territory between the First and Fourth districts *Sixth: District of Basilan, which includes the Spanish possessions in Sulu and Basilan Upon the restoration of the Jesuits in the Philippines, he gave them Mindanao as their mission field. Civil registries (birth, death, marriage registers) were established throughout the archipelago pursuant to a decree in 1861. Also in 1861, the Isabel Gate (Pintong Isabela II) was built between Fort San Gabriel and Fort San Domingo in honor of Queen Isabel II of Spain. All municipalities were required to make appropriations for schools to provide basic education and solve the illiteracy problem. The Royal Academy of Fine Arts was established during his administration. In 1862, he handed over his position to Salvador Vald√©s. Senator In 1858, he was promoted lieutenant general and was elected senator for life (senador vitalicio) in the Senate of Spain. In 1862, he was part of the delegation welcoming Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain and Infante Sebastian of Portugal and Spain. In 1866, he presented his adherence to the decision on the modification of the 1851 law concerning the Pacific Squadron. In 1868, he participated in the Senate's March to the Court. In 1877, he was a member of the Commission of Army Promotions. In 1883, he was again senator for life, but by appointment of royal decree and approval of the Permanent Commission. Death He died in Madrid on 11 April 1886. The municipalities of Lemery, Batangas and Lemery, Iloilo were named in his honor, although the former is said to be actually named after a different person: Captain Roberto Lemery, who died in 1856.

He made headlines in September 2016 for successfully producing the world's first three-parent baby using the spindle transfer technique of mitochondrial replacement. Having obtained an M.D. from Zhejiang University School of Medicine, an M.Sc. from University of Birmingham, and a Ph.D. from University of Cambridge, he became the founder-director of New Hope Fertility Center in New York, USA. Biography John Zhang studied at the Zhejiang University School of Medicine in China, and graduated with an MD in 1984. He continued a post-graduate course at the University of Birmingham, UK. He studied male fertility on which he earned an M.Sc. in 1985. He received the British Postgraduate Scholarship in 1989 with which he pursued further research at the University of Cambridge. He obtained a Ph.D. in 1991 for his thesis on in vitro maturation and fertilization of mammalian oocytes. Between 1991 and 1993, he worked as a post-doctoral scholar at Georgetown University in US. From 1993 to 1997, he coordinated a Rockefeller Foundation research programme of Georgetown University with Peking University. He completed residency in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the New York University School of Medicine in 1997. He became the first Fellow in the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility of New York University School of Medicine in 2001. In 2004, he founded the New Hope Fertility Center in New York City, becoming its Medical Director. The clinic has been extended to China, Russia, and Mexico. Scientific contributions In 2003, while working with researchers at the Sun Yat-Sen University of Medical Science, Zhang experimented with a mitochondrial donation technique called pronuclear transfer to help a Chinese mother who had an infertility problem. He used a healthy egg cell (ovum) from a donor woman, from which he removed the nucleus. He extracted only the young nuclei (pronuclei) from the mother and her husband, and introduced them into the host egg cell, hence the popular name \\"three-parent baby\\". There was about 70% success in fertilization. Five embryos were implanted in the mother's uterus, and she was normally pregnant. Zhang published a preliminary report in 2003 in the journal Fertility and Sterility. However, he was careful of the outcome and did not disclose the full data and results. He had regret for breaking the news so soon, blaming his collaborator as \\"so eager to be famous\\". As it happened, none of the embryos survived to full term. He made the full report only after 13 years, in October 2016. In order to help a woman in Mexico who had a genetic- neurological trait called Leigh syndrome, Zhang used the spindle transfer technique in 2015. Leigh syndrome in the mother is due to mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. The mother already had four miscarriages, and even in the two successful births, the children suffered from the disease and died. Therefore, the only solution was to replace the mutant genes with healthy ones. Zhang and his team took the nucleus from the mother's egg cell and inserted it into a different egg, taken from a donor woman with no genetic abnormality, which had had its original nucleus removed. Thus, the mother's nucleus replaced the nucleus in a donor cell, which had genetically normal mitochondria. The new egg cell was then fertilized with the father's sperm. Zhang could produce only one normally developing embryo out of five he created. The embryo was then implanted in the mother's uterus, and a healthy boy was born nine months later, on 6 April 2016. The study was published in the September 2016 issue of Fertility and Sterility. Criticisms and comments Although the baby does not indicate symptoms of Leigh syndrome, there are still concerns over the genetic conditions. According to the first report, the technique did not completely remove the mother's mitochondria, such that about 1-2% of her faulty mtDNA remained. However, it is generally considered that less than 20% is too low to cause any problems. There are also concerns over ethical and legal issues. There is an argument that the technique is very close to human cloning, which is generally objected to. There is also opposition to the nuclear transfer method due to the waste of embryos, or potential risk to children born by the technique. The latter point is particularly evidenced by the death of the fetuses in China in the earlier experimentation, which caused China to ban the technique. In the US, the FDA restricts any mitochondrial transfer techniques in humans, and requires an Investigational New Drug application. In contrast, the UK became the first country to legalize it, in 2015. However, Zhang chose the clinic branch in Mexico, saying that \\"there are no rules [there]\\". He commented that \\"To save lives is the ethical thing to do.\\" Sian Harding, a member of the British Nuffield Council on Bioethics and the Scientific Advisory Board of the PPP \\"Stem Cells for Safer Medicines\\", also defended Zhang, saying that there was no deliberate destruction of embryos, and said, \\"It's as good as or better than what we'll do in the UK.\\" As of 2019, his affiliations with scientist He Jiankui has been questioned in regards to his involvement and knowledge of the gene edited babies, Lulu and Nana. It was reported that Zhang intended to open a medical tourism business in Hainan for gene-edited babies. Honours Zhang is a founder and member of the Life Science Society at Cambridge University. He is a consultant for Reproductive Nuclear Transfer and Stem Cell Research, Cellular Reconstruction and the Special Programme of Therapeutic Cloning at Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou. He is also a consultant for the IVF and Gamete Laboratory at the Fertility Centre of Wenzhou Medical College, Zhejiang Province, China. He is a member of British Fertility Society, and of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). In May 2020, The Times featured Zhang on their 'Science Power List.'

Her mother, Hilda Runciman, Viscountess Runciman of Doxford and her father Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford were both members of parliament. She was educated at Notting Hill High School for GirlsOxford Dictionary of National Biography The founding ATA pilots and their Tiger Moths: left to right Pauline Gower, Winifred Crossley Fair, Margaret Cunnison, Margaret Fairweather, Mona Friedlander, Joan Hughes, Gabrielle Patterson, Rosemary Rees and Marion Wilberforce She was an instructor for the Civil Air Guard at Renfrew. After war was declared in 1939, she was one of the first eight women members of the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA). She flew many planes including Tiger Moths and Hurricanes, and was the first woman to fly a Supermarine Spitfire. Shortly after the death of her husband, Douglas, piloting an ATA aircraft on 3 April 1944, she died in a crash on 4 August that same year; also on board was her sister Kitty who was injured. The original cause of the aborted mission was a mechanical problem with the fuel tank. Because of the lack of fuel Margaret was obliged to make a forced landing in Cheshire which went well until they hit a ditch and she lost control as the Percival Proctor flipped over. She had the worst injuries and despite being rushed to a hospital she died the next day. She had only just returned to work after giving birth. She and her husband are the only ATA couple to share the same grave and headstone. They are buried at Dunure cemetery in Ayrshire. Legacy A bus company in Hatfield named its eight buses after the \\"first eight\\" of the Tiger Moth pilots in the ATA, including Fairweather. The fifteen surviving women members of the ATA (and 100 surviving male pilots) were given a special award in 2008 by the Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

It has an erect, hairy leaf and usually a single white to pinkish flower with darker markings. It is only found in a few places due to habitat loss and is considered to be vulnerable. Description Caladenia brumalis is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy, lance- shaped leaf, long and wide. There is usually only a single white to pinkish flower with darker stripes, on a stem high. The flowers are about wide. The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped near the base and long, wide near the base but narrows to a thread-like tip covered with many black glands. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, wide but narrow to a tip similar to that on the dorsal sepal. The petals are similar to the lateral sepals but slightly shorter and narrower. The labellum is whitish or pinkish, sometimes with red markings and is long, wide with erect lateral lobes. There are seven to nine calli about on the sides of the lobes and many short, white-tipped calli along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs in August and September. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia brumalis was first formally described by David L. Jones in 1991 from a specimen collected near Port Victoria and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (brumalis) is a Latin word meaning \\"of the shortest day\\" or \\"wintry\\" and refers to the late winter flowering of this orchid. Distribution and habitat This caladenia occurs in woodland, mallee, shrubland and sedgeland in restricted coastal locations near Adelaide and on the Eyre and Yorke Peninsulas. It is known to flower profusely after fire. Conservation Caladenia brumalis is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 of South Australia. The main threats to it are loss of habitat, high grazing pressure and weed invasion.

Biography=Early life Margaret was born in 1876 to Thomas and Agnes McNair who both emigrated from Lanarkshire, Scotland to Otago, New Zealand. Her mother died in 1887 after which her father took the family to Victoria, Australia. Margaret married Bob Semple, a coal miner and unionist, at Outtrim, Victoria, on 27 June 1898. She gave birth to their first child a year later. The Semples initially lived in Western Australia, but when Margaret fell sick, they had to return to Victoria. She was friends with Margaret Thorn who labelled her a \\"capable woman\\" referring to how she almost solely raised her children whilst her husband was away on union or political matters. Thorn recalled a story where a girl accidentally cut off two of her fingers only for Semple to sew them back on with thread for a full recovery. Political career Semple served as president of the Wellington women's branch of the Labour Party, and was a member of the party national executive from 1930 to 1943. Semple was elected as a Wellington City Councillor in 1938. She lost her seat in 1941, an election which saw all Labour councillors unseated.

Historians have argued that her own political contributions between the 1910s and 1940s were considerable, though heavily overshadowed by her husband's, who himself seldom acknowledged her efforts in any depth. Semple died in 1967. Bob had died in 1955.

Choi, originally a Buddhist monk, then a convert to Presbyterian pastor, was married six times. He was the mentor of the impeached South Korean president, Park Geun-hye (the daughter of former president Park Chung-hee), until his death in 1994. He allegedly used his relationship with Park to solicit bribes from government officials and businessmen. In late 2016, a scandal involving his daughter, Choi Soon-sil, broke out, with allegations that she too has exerted undue influence over President Park.

According to a report by the Korean Central Intelligence Agency from the 1970s that was published by a South Korean news magazine in 2007, Choi initially approached Park Geun-hye by telling her that her mother had appeared to him in his dreams, asking him to help her daughter. Choi was an associate of former- president President Park Chung-hee until the latter's death by assassination in 1979. Kim Jae-gyu, the director of the KCIA who assassinated President Park Chung-hee, told a court that one of his motives was what he called the president‚Äôs failure to stop Choi Tae-min's corrupt activities and keep him away from his daughter.

Description The mallee typically grows to a height of but can reach as high as . It has smooth mottled grey to brown coloured bark that can become black over greenish yellow new bark. It has no lignotuber and a single stem. The concolorous glossy green adult leaves are arranged alternately. The leaf blade has a lanceolate shape that is in length and wide with a base tapering to petiole. It blooms between October and December and produces crimson-red flowers. Each axillary unbranched inflorescence is often down-turned and in length and occurs groups of seven per umbel. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanists Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper in 2002 and Taxonomy of species deriving from the publication of Eucalyptus subseries Cornutae Benth. (Myrtaceae) as published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet is taken from the Latin word cernuus meaning nodding, towards earth in reference referring to the downward facing inflorescences. The species was previously thought to have been Eucalyptus nutans. Distribution It has a limited range along the south coast of Western Australia in the Goldfields-Esperance region near Ravensthorpe particularly in the Fitzgerald River National Park. Cultivation It is used for ornamental plantings, shade and honey production. When cultivated it can tolerate arid area, is slow growing and requires little maintenance.

It landed on D-Day and saw action throughout the campaign in North West Europe, defending the vital Scheldt Estuary until the end of the war. Origin The regiment was formed in January 1942 from the short-lived 86th Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery (86th S/L Rgt) which had only been raised in the previous year as part of the rapid expansion of Anti-Aircraft Command.Farndale, Annex M.86 S/L Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45.120 LAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. 86th Searchlight Regiment 86th S/L Regiment was formed on 23 January 1941 at Henderson Church Hall at Kilmarnock in Scotland during the height of the Luftwaffe's night Blitz on British cities. Major J.B. Allan was posted from 52nd (Queen's Edinburgh Royal Scots) S/L Rgt and promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel to command the new regiment, moving the Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) to Craigie House, Ayr, where it was joined by the advance parties of three S/L batteries that had been formed at the training regiments on 14 November 1940:Frederick, pp. 861, 874.86 S/L Rgt War Diary, 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 166/3106. * 526 S/L Bty, formed by 233rd S/L Training Rgt at Saighton Camp from a cadre of experienced officers and men provided by 65th (Essex Regiment) S/L Rgt * 527 S/L Bty, formed by 233rd S/L Training Rgt, cadre from 69th (3rd City of London) S/L Rgt * 528 S/L Bty, formed by 234th S/L Training Rgt at Carlisle, cadre from 61st (South Lancashire Regiment) S/L Rgt The regiment came under the command of 63rd AA Brigade in 12th AA Division, responsible for the air defence of West Scotland.Farndale, Annex D, p. 261.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396. In mid-March the regiment began a partial deployment without searchlights to guard Vulnerable Points (VPs) in the light anti-aircraft (LAA) role, equipped with 20 mm guns (Oerlikon or Hispano) and Lewis guns. The regiment received its first 150 cm searchlights in April, by which time RHQ had returned to Kilmarnock. It became operational, equipped with 90 cm and 150 cm S/L projectors, sound locators and electrical generators, on 9 May during a Luftwaffe raid. The following night, Rudolf Hess landed by parachute some 200 yards from one of the regiment's sites and was apprehended by the local Home Guard unit. The Blitz was ending by now, and the regiment spent the rest of 1941 uneventfully. As well as AA defence, it had a subsidiary role in spotting Parachute mines laid by Luftwaffe aircraft in the Clyde. At the beginning of 1942, the regiment gave up its searchlights and converted to the LAA gun role as 120th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment from 19 January. The establishment of an LAA regiment was smaller than that of a S/L regiment, so 275 other ranks (ORs) were transferred to 57th (Cameronian) S/L Rgt.Frederick, pp. 806‚Äì7, 838.120 LAA Rgt War Diary, 1942, TNA file WO 166/7706. 120th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment The new regiment consisted of RHQ and 393, 394 and 395 LAA Batteries. In February it moved to Holywood in Northern Ireland to attend 237 LAA Training Regiment, returning to Stranraer in Scotland in mid-April. It took over LAA gun sites in 63 AA Bde area equipped variously with Bofors 40 mm guns and Light machine guns, and established RHQ at West Kilbride. On 8 April 448 LAA Bty joined the regiment (this battery had been formed on 19 February from the fourth Troops of 97, 128 and 266 LAA Btys of 36th LAA Rgt). On 10 July 448 LAA Bty transferred to 84th S/L Rgt and 11 (Supplementary Reserve) LAA Bty joined from 4th (Ulster) LAA Rgt (formerly 3rd (Ulster) (SR) S/L RgtFrederick, pp. 800, 820. Training continued during the summer, and in August the regiment sent a cadre of trained officers and ORs to form a new 488 LAA Bty at 212 LAA Training Regiment at Chester (this battery later formed part of 145th LAA Rgt). At the end of August the regiment moved to Stamford, Lincolnshire to join 32nd (Midland) AA Bde in 2nd AA Division. Here it took over VPs at places across the East Midlands such as Grantham, Peterborough, Cottesmore, Coleshill and Nuneaton.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82.

Mobile training Bofors 40 mm LAA gun equipped with 'Stiffkey Stick' sightsIn late 1942, 120th LAA Rgt began to prepare for mobile warfare. In November, a draft of 119 drivers was posted in from 227 Driver Training Regiment, and that month the regiment transferred to 50th AA Bde in the North Midlands. RHQ moved to South Collingham with the batteries moving to sites in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. In December‚ÄìJanuary the regiment was at Haltwhistle battle training area, next it went to 11 AA Bde Tactical School at Leigh-on-Sea for a month's mobile training, and then to Oulton Park Camp near Tarporley, Cheshire.120 LAA Rgt War Diary, 1943, TNA file WO 166/11738. On 13 March 120th LAA Rgt was ordered to mobilise as part of the field force, and it began receiving its own towed Bofors guns (previously it had operated static guns at fixed sites). Mobile LAA regiments had an establishment of three Batteries each of three Troops equipped with six towed Bofors. As a mobile unit, it was also given its own Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) workshop and Royal Corps of Signals detachment.Routledge, p. 305. Upon mobilisation, 120th LAA Rgt was withdrawn from Air Defence of Great Britain and came under War Office control; however it was immediately lent back to AA Command, which required more LAA guns to deal with Luftwaffe 'hit and run' attacks, and deployed to the Southampton area. At first it formed part of 73rd AA Bde,Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 18 February 1943, TNA file WO 212/9. but on 1 June 1943 it came under the command of the newly formed 76th AA Bde in Cheshire, which was training for the planned invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord).76 AA Bde War Diary, 1943, TNA file WO 166/11247. In June 1943 the regiment attended No 16 AA Practice Camp at Clacton-on-Sea before returning to Cheshire in July, with RHQ at Marbury Hall. After a second course at Clacton, the regiment stayed in Essex, first at Wakes Colne, near Colchester, and then at Wimbush Camp near Saffron Walden. In September it received 18 self- propelled (SP) Bofors guns (these were usually mounted on Morris C9B 4 x 4 lorries) and handed in its towed Mk II and Mk III Bofors in exchange for Mk I guns using 'Stiffkey Stick' sights. In October, the regiment was in Bournemouth for beach landing exercises in cooperation with 113th Heavy AA Rgt, under whose command it would operate on D-Day. After visits to No 14 LAA Practice Camp at Nethertown, Cumberland, and Harlech Anti-Tank Range in Wales, the regiment returned to Bournemouth at the end of the year. At the beginning of 1944, 120th LAA Rgt moved to Southend-on-Sea, where in late March it received nine Crusader AA Mark I tracked self-propelled (SP) Bofors guns, which would have a special role in the assault landing on D-Day. In addition, 76th AA Brigade assigned 1618 LAA Rgt Platoon of 323rd Company, Royal Army Service Corps (RASC), to the regiment to provide mobility. In March the regiment moved back to Southampton for exercises, where it remained until May, when the units required for the assault phase of Overlord began to gather in southern England. 120th LAA Rgt was already at Southampton while the rest of the brigade (including the rear echelons of 120th LAA Rgt) concentrated at Southend.76 AA Bde War Diary, 1944, TNA file WO 171/1084.120 LAA Rgt War Diary, 1944, TNA file WO 171/1135. D-Day Crusader AA with 40 mm Bofors gun In Second Army's plan for Overlord, 76th AA Bde was to support XXX Corps in its landing on Gold Beach. LAA defence was emphasised at the start of the operation, since low-level attack by Luftwaffe aircraft was considered the most likely threat. Assault units were to be landed with minimum scales of equipment, to be brought up to strength by parties landing later.Routledge, pp. 305‚Äì7.80 AA Bde Operation Order No 1, 20 May 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085. For the assault phase, RHQ, 394 and 395 Btys of 120th LAA Rgt formed part of the AA Assault Group assigned to 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division landing on Gold Beach, under the command of RHQ 113th HAA Rgt.Joslen, p. 581. 320 Bty (A, B and C Trps) of 93rd LAA Rgt was also placed under command of 120th LAA Rgt for the landing; this battery was equipped with 18 triple mountings of 20 mm guns (Oerlikon or the new Polstens), half of them mounted on Crusader chassis.93 LAA Rgt War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 171/1124. 394 Battery landed two guns on King Sector of Gold Beach by 08.45 (75 minutes after H-Hour). The first of E Trp's Crusaders bogged down and its engine was flooded, but the gun remained manned although the Mk I Bofors it was towing was 'drowned'. The rest of E Trp had been diverted. F Trp's recce party beached at 09.15, but its first Crusader, towing a Mk I Bofors, did not arrive until 17.00, and the remainder at 20.30.120th LAA Rgt, D-Day Diary of Events, included in June 1944 (TNA file WO 171/1135) and July 1945 (TNA file WO 171/4966) War Diaries. On Jig Sector, H Trp's recce party landed 15 minutes after H-Hour and had got four guns ashore by 14.40, together with two triple 20 mm mountings of B Trp 320 Bty. But fighting was still going on around Le Hamel and rough seas meant that further unloading was delayed. J Troop got three guns ashore (one towed gun being drowned) but the LCT carrying the rest of the Troop suffered an engine failure and could not land until D + 3 (9 June). By the end of D-Day, 395 Bty had 9 Bofors and two 20 mm mountings ashore, covering the beach exits, where men of H Trp had helped the Royal Engineers to clear mines. The landing beaches were 'solid with tracked vehicles' and the landing craft carrying the guns had to wait, so detachments of 120th LAA Rgt acted as infantry, clearing enemy positions while awaiting the arrival of their guns. While digging in on the beach, Gunner George Hurst saw a man washed off a drowned vehicle into the sea and swam out under fire in an attempt to save him, for which Hurst was awarded the Military Medal.Hurst's citation, endorsed by Lt-Gen Sir Bernard Montgomery, TNA file WO 373/49/274. Bofors gun at Le Hamel, 17 June 1944. The RHQ command group had landed on King Beach about 2 hours after H-Hour, and spent the night in a shell crater. By midnight, the AA Defence Commander on Gold Beach reported the situation:Routledge, p. 310. King Sector: * 394/120 LAA Rgt - 8 x 40 mm * 320/93 LAA Rgt - 6 x triple 20mm Jig Sector: * 395/120 LAA Rgt ‚Äì 9 x 40mm * 320/93 LAA Rgt ‚Äì 2 x triple 20 mm There was little enemy air activity during the night. For example, F Troop fired 50 rounds without success, but at 06.30 on D + 1 a lone Focke-Wulf Fw 190 crossed the beach and was shot down by the first round from Sergeant Appleby's No 3 Detachment. Later, No 2 Detachment shelled a German strongpoint that had caused casualties to 2nd Battalion Hertfordshire Regiment of No 9 Beach Group. The rest of the regiment turned up between D + 1 and D + 4, some landing craft having had to return to England and been sent over again. 393 Bty and D Troop of 392 Bty had embarked in the Thames and sailed through the Straits of Dover under German shellfire. The gunners provided relief crews for the ships' Bofors and 20 mm guns. These guns arrived and deployed during D + 2 and D + 3. Normandy Off-duty crew of 393 LAA Bty in Normandy 17 June 1944. In the days following the landings, 76th AA Bde's guns moved inland to extend cover from the landing beaches to Port-en-Bessin and Arromanches, where a Mulberry harbour was being constructed.Routledge, Table XLIX, p. 319. Most Luftwaffe attacks concentrated on the shipping and on the bridges at the other end of the beachhead, so there was less activity over 120th LAA Rgt: at the end of June, the regimental war diary recorded that during the month there had been 'surprisingly slight enemy activity ‚Äì not a single determined attack by a formation of aircraft over the Regimental area'. Nevertheless, 120th LAA claimed three Category I and two Category II 'kills' during the month. On 9 July, 373 LAA Bty (detached from 114th LAA Rgt) came under command of 120th LAA Rgt, and on 14 July the regiment redeployed to cover the Mulberry. Enemy air activity over the beachhead remained slight in July, and the regiment only claimed two Cat I kills for the month. The guns of 120 LAA Rgt were only engaged on four nights during August. 373 LAA Bty returned to its parent unit in mid-August, and at the end of the month the unreliable Crusader SP guns were replaced by towed Mk I Bofors and the regiment reorganised so that each battery consisted of one Troop of SP Bofors on lorry chassis and two Troops of towed guns. Breakout Once 21st Army Group broke out of its beachhead, 76th AA Bde was relieved of its responsibilities on the coast on 1 September and was made available to support the advance. 62nd LAA Battery of 20th LAA Rgt (which had been manning the AA guns on the 'Gooseberry' blockships off the beaches) was attached to the regiment for the advance. The regiment deployed at Amiens (393 and 395 Btys) and Dieppe (62 and 394 Btys) on 2 September.Routledge, Table LI, pp. 328‚Äì9. On 14 September 62 Bty left and the regiment moved on to guard the river crossings at Abbeville (393 and 394 Btys) and Saint-Valery-en-Caux (395 Bty). As the advance continued, 120th LAA Rgt joined the rest of 76th AA Bde at Boulogne for AA and coast defence the day after the port surrendered on 22 September. But the regiment did not fire a single round during September.Routledge, p. 323.Routledge, Table LII, pp. 330‚Äì1. In October, 393 handed in the last of the regiment's SP guns, so that it was now all-towed. In the middle of the month, 76th AA Bde was relieved by 103 AA Bde, and moved into Belgium; 395/120 Bty remained at Boulogne where it was operating an early warning station for the whole LAA defence of the town. The Scheldt SP Bofors, seen here in action against German positions in April 1945. 120th LAA Regiment was deployed to protect the two Army Groups Royal Artillery (9th AGRA and 2nd Canadian AGRA), which were supporting 3rd Canadian Division's operations to clear the Breskens Pocket along the Leopold Canal (Operation Switchback). During the Leopold Canal battle, the regiment's guns had to make rapid deployments in flooded and heavily mined ground under intermittent shellfire. Captain Alan Johnstone carried out hazardous reconnaissances in the forward areas for his Troop, and Gunner Daniel Kelly drove his gun tractor into action with determination, on occasions clearing mines to get his gun into action. Both were awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre with palms, and Johnstone was also made a Chevalier of the Belgian Order of Leopold II.Johnstone's citation, TNA file WO 373/111/865.Kelly's citation, TNA file WO 373/111/1349. Yet the regiment's guns did not have to engage a single enemy aircraft during October. Once the Canadians had cleared the German defenders, the regiment closed up to the southern side of the Scheldt Estuary and was rejoined by 395 Bty. During November the Canadians and 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division took South Beveland (Operation Vitality) and 120th LAA Rgt crossed to defend the anchorages and channel of the Scheldt, with 394 Bty deploying to Flushing on Walcheren after that island was captured (Operation Infatuate). The port of Antwerp was vital to the Allied war effort, and large numbers of AA units were deployed to defend the approaches up the Scheldt. 120th LAA Regiment remained in the North Scheldt area under 76th AA Bde until the end of the war. Antwerp itself was heavily bombarded by V-1 flying bombs but there was little air activity over the estuary, although 394 Bty fired an emergency barrage on 10 December, destroying one enemy aircraft.Routledge, Table LVII, p. 366. Biber midget submarine preserved at Deutsches Technik Museum Berlin. When the German Army launched its Ardennes offensive (the Battle of the Bulge) aimed at breaking through to Antwerp, 76th AA Bde was ordered to take precautions against possible attacks by German airborne troops. If that happened, 394 Bty at Flushing would fall under the command of 113rd HAA Rgt while 120th LAA Rgt's second-in-command, Major J.R. Morgan, would assume command of an infantry force composed of 393 and 395 Btys together with 391 Bty of 113rd HAA and 5 Bty of 2nd S/L Rgt to hunt down any attackers. In the event, no breakthrough or airborne landing occurred, but on 1 January 1945, the Luftwaffe launched Operation Bodenplatte: daylight attacks against Allied airfields in support of the Ardennes offensive, described by the regimental war diary as the 'first daylight activity on any appreciable scale since [the] unit deployed in this area'.76 AA Bde War Diary, January‚ÄìJuly 1945, TNA file WO 171/4889.120th LAA War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/4960.Routledge, pp. 346‚Äì7. After that, enemy air activity was sparse and the AA guns were more concerned with coastal defence. On 4 January a section of 395 Bty redeployed to Westkapelle at the western tip of Walcheren in an anti-submarine role. On 17 February this section destroyed an enemy one-man torpedo, followed by a Biber midget submarine on 8 March and two more manned torpedoes on 12 March. Disbandment Shortly afterwards the Allies crossed the Rhine and as the war came to an end many AA units were disbanded or converted to other roles. Regimental REME workshops had already been disbanded in mid-February and replaced by a single brigade workshop leaving just a small REME detachment with RHQ. However, 120th LAA Rgt was retained for garrison duties in occupied Germany. After VE Day it handed in its guns and tractors and concentrated near Antwerp. In June it moved to Bochum to assume guard and patrol duties, then moved to Emsdetten, where it remained as part of British Army of the Rhine for the rest of its service. The first men of the regiment began to be demobilised from July 1945, including Lt-Col Allan, who had commanded the regiment since the beginning and had been awarded an OBE in February.Allan's citation, TNA file WO 373/83/73. Major Morgan was promoted to replace him. In December the remaining original intake of the regiment (227 ORs) were demobilised, leaving the unit at roughly half strength. 120th LAA Regiment commenced its disbandment at Emsdetten on 15 January 1946, and completed the process by 30 January.120th LAA War Diary 1946, TNA file WO 171/9125.

Known as Russia's \\"grey cardinal\\", Surkov served as a political adviser to President Vladimir Putin and is the architect of Russia's ideology of sovereign democracy. The document leak included over 2,300 emails from Surkov's inbox. The emails illustrate Russian plans to politically destabilize Ukraine and the coordination of affairs with major opposition leaders in separatist east Ukraine. The release included a document sent to Surkov by Denis Pushilin, former Chair of the People's Soviet of the Donetsk People's Republic, listing casualties that occurred during 2014. It also included a 22-page outline of \\"a plan to support nationalist and separatist politicians and to encourage early parliamentary elections in Ukraine, all with the aim of undermining the government in Kiev.\\" The Kremlin has said that the leaked documents are fake. Authenticity Washington think tank Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab conducted an analysis of the emails. They determined that they were genuine, based partially on the routing information. Russian entrepreneur Yevgeny Chichvarkin confirmed that his emails from the document dump were authentic, saying \\"Yes, this is my original text.\\" Russian journalist Svetlana Babaeva also verified that her three emails from the leak were genuine. Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov suggested that the emails did not belong to Surkov, saying that he \\"does not use email.\\" Oleksandr Tkachuk of Security Service of Ukraine stated that they had managed to \\"authenticate a number of documents in the release\\" but could not confirm the authenticity of the entire batch of documents. Publication On 23 October 2016, Ukrainian hacker group CyberHunta published correspondence that it alleged was from Surkov's office email account. Volunteers from the open-source intelligence initiative Inform Napalm requested additional evidence from an alliance of hacker groups that includes CyberHunta, RUH8, FalconsFlame, and TRINITY. They secured the release of a 1GB Microsoft Outlook data file. Inform Napalm reported that the hackers also were in possession of documents from 2015 and 2016 that were being analysed by intelligence agencies and were not released due to their operational value. New batches of emails from the leak were further published in November 2017 and April 2018. Contents The document leak was a Microsoft Outlook data file (.PST) that included 2,337 emails from the inbox of Surkov's prm_surkova@gov.ru. The released material covers a period from September 2013 to November 2014. The email address appears to have been an office account run by Surkov's aides, including \\"Masha\\" and \\"Yevgenia\\". Among the documents were scans of Surkov's and his family's passports. While the vast majority of the emails comprise routine briefings and schedules, a small handful are of geopolitical significance or potentially incriminating. These emails illustrate Russian plans to politically destabilize Ukraine and the coordination of affairs with major opposition leaders in separatist east Ukraine. An email sent to Surkov and others on 14 June 2014 by Denis Pushilin, the former Chair of the People's Soviet of the Donetsk People's Republic, contains a document listing casualties that occurred from 26 May to 6 June 2014. The list of casualties includes a row for an unnamed soldier listed as \\"VDV Pskovsky\\" (\\"–í–î–í –ü—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π\\"), a designation for a deployment of Russian Airborne Troops (VDV) from the city of Pskov. Paratroopers based in Pskov were thought to be among the first of Russia's covert casualties in Ukraine in 2014. The Pskov-based 76th Guards Air Assault Division was awarded the Order of Suvorov by Putin for unspecified tasks in August 2014. An email sent to Surkov from a Russian government account on 18 June 2014 detailed the practicalities of Russia absorbing a portion of Ukraine. An email attachment included a briefing paper titled \\"On the Risks of an Economic Blockade of the LNR and DNR\\". The paper noted that 30% of the Donbass electrical supply comes from power plants in Zaporizhzhya. The document includes suggestions to supplement electrical supply in Donbass with power from the Rostov Nuclear Power Plant in Russia. The document's author also suggested increasing iron ore shipments and connecting Donbass to the Voronezh Oblast electricity grid. One of the emails to Surkov from Konstantin Malofeev contained a list of recommended candidates for positions in the separatist government prior to their appointments. The documents also included a spreadsheet containing the budget for a newspaper in Donetsk. On 25 August 2014, a Russian official forwarded an email to Surkov from Russian Reporter editor Vitaly Leybin. The email bore the title \\"corrections in the text\\" and concerned a letter to the Ukrainian government from the \\"public representatives of the Donbass.\\" A nearly identical article, purportedly from citizens living in Ukraine, appeared in Russian Reporter days later with only minor changes. Within the week, the letter had appeared on Russia Today and other Russian websites.

In his long political career, Nahaolelua served under the reigns of five monarchs: Kamehameha III, Kamehameha IV and Kamehameha V, Lunalilo and KalƒÅkaua. Early life Nahaolelua was born on September 11, 1806, in Kawaihae, in the district of Kohala, on the island of Hawaii. He was given the name Nahaolelua meaning \\"the two haole\\" (\\"foreigners\\") in honor of John Young and Isaac Davis, the two foreign advisors to King Kamehameha I during his conquest of the Kingdom of Hawaii. He started his career as a schoolmaster teaching Hawaiian at the royal school in Kaupo, Maui. He later became one of the first generation of Hawaiians to receive a western education at the Lahainaluna Seminary from the Christian missionaries who arrived in Hawaii in 1820. Political career Nahaolelua began working for the government as a district magistrate and circuit judge on Maui. He also served as royal postmaster. During the governorship of James KƒÅnehoa Young, Nahaolelua served as deputy governor of Maui. Shortly after KƒÅnehoa's death in 1851, he succeeded as Governor of Maui, although the position was not officially confirmed until the following year on December 3, 1852. He served as Governor for twenty-two years until 1874. As a royal governor, he also held a seat in the House of Nobles, the upper house of the legislature, traditionally reserved for the high chiefs. He sat during most of the legislative sessions between 1853 and 1874. He served as a member of the Privy Council of the King. He was elected the President of the Legislative Assembly during the sessions of 1870, 1872, and the special sessions of 1873 and 1874. During the reign of Kamehameha V, he was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Order of Kamehameha I. Issue of succession, 1872‚Äì1874 Governor Nahaolelua (center, right) socializing with other members of the royal court during the reign of Kamehameha V. In 1872, Nahaolelua was present at the deathbed of King Kamehameha V. Kneeling at the side of bed, with many of the members of the royal court present, he spoke with the monarch in his last attempts to name a successor to the throne. Kamehameha V, who regarded him as a close friend and business associate, asked Nahaolelua to choose an heir for him. He refused and answered, \\"Any one, may it please Your Majesty, of the chiefs now present.\\" The King attempted to name his cousin Bernice Pauahi Bishop but she refused the offer, and he died the same day without naming a successor.; ; ; Because Kamehameha V died with no heir, the constitution called for the legislature, which Nahaolelua presided over as President of the Legislative Assembly, to select the next monarch. By both popular vote, and the unanimous vote in the legislature, Lunalilo became the first elected king of Hawaii in 1873.; ; ; ; In private, Nahaolelua tried to persuade the new king to name a successor so the kingdom would not face another succession crisis. However, after a short reign, Lunalilo died in 1874 without an heir to succeed to him. In the election that followed, David KalƒÅkaua, ran against Queen Emma, the widow of Kamehameha IV. On February 12, 1874, for the second time in Hawaiian history, a special session of the legislature was called to elect a new monarch, and Nahaolelua was chosen again as the President of the Legislative Assembly.; ; The assembly voted thirty-nine to six in favor of KalƒÅkaua. The subsequent announcement caused a riot at the courthouse as Emmaite supporters attacked and beat the native legislators who had voted for KalƒÅkaua. American and British troops were landed, and the rioters were arrested.; ; ; ; ; ; ; Nahaolelua, a known supporter and friend of Queen Emma, had left the courthouse before the riot, to bring her the news of her defeat. She reportedly sent him back with the message: \\"If they could not obtain their desires now, perhaps they had better wait until the morrow, when a new election for Sovereign could be had.\\" The next day Queen Emma asked Nahaolelua about the possibility of holding a second election which he refused.; Later life and death After the accession of KalƒÅkaua, Nahaolelua resigned the Governorship of Maui and was appointed to the new monarch's cabinet as Minister of Finance on February 17, 1874. However, due to failing health, he resigned the post on October 31, 1874, and returned to his residence in Lahaina, on the island of Maui. After being ill for a few months Nahaolelua died on September 5 or 15, 1875, at his residence in Lahaina at the age of sixty-nine. Forgoing a lavish state funeral traditionally given to a person of his rank, his funeral was held the same day as his death, and he was buried in a plain pine coffin in a prepared vault at the Anglican Hale Aloha Cemetery in Lahaina. Marriage and descendants Nahaolelua married Helekunihi (died 1888) and had one son Obid (sometimes spelled Obed), who died shortly after birth on March 20, 1858. A second child, who also died young, is mentioned in Nahaolelua's obituary but not named. Under the Hawaiian tradition of hƒÅnai, they adopted Edward George Huakini (better known simply as \\"Kia\\"), the son of Helekunihi's brother Aki and Ka ªaiohelo. Kia Nahaolelua (1852‚Äì1901) became the sole heir of Governor Nahaolelua's estate after his death. Kia married Elizabeth Kahele Manawaola St. John (1852‚Äì1909), who served as lady- in-waiting to Queen Liliuokalani and accompanied her to Washington, DC during her 1897 trip to protest American annexation of Hawaii. They had nine children many of whose descendants are alive to this day. Honours * 50px Knight Commander of the Royal Order of Kamehameha I.

It is used mainly to express acts, situations and in general \\"states of affairs\\" that are depended on another verb form, usually a finite one. It is a non declinable nominal verb form equivalent to a noun, and expresses the verbal notion abstractly; used as a noun in its main uses, it has many properties of it, as it will be seen below, yet it differs from it in some respects:K√ºhner, Raphael. Grammar of the Greek language for the use in high schools and colleges. (Translated by B. B. Edwards and S. H. Taylor). 1844. Pp. 449 ff. : (a) When used with no article, and in its major uses (subject/object), it can normally only be equivalent to either a nominative or an accusative case; used with the article, it may be in any case (nominative, genitive, dative and accusative). : (b) It shows morphological formation according to aspect, voice (active, middle, passive) and tense (only the future infinitive). : (c) It retains some verbal syntactic features: it governs the same oblique case (its object) as the verb to which it belongs, and it may have a subject of its own, in accusative case (See the section accusative and infinitive below). : (d) It is modified by adverbials and not by adjectives. Uses Ancient Greek has both (a) the infinitive with the article (articular infinitive), for example \\"doing wrong, wrong-doing\\" and (b) the infinitive without the article, for example \\"to do wrong\\".  The infinitive with the article  The articular infinitiveHerbert Weir Smyth ¬ß¬ß 2025-2037 corresponds to a cognate verbal noun (in singular number only). It is preceded by the neuter singular article (, , , ) and has the character and function of both a noun and a verbal form. It can be used in any case (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative) and thus participate in a construction just like any other noun: it can be subject, object (direct or indirect), predicative expression (rarely), or it may also serve as an apposition; it may have an adnominal (e.g. to be in a genitive construction as a possessive or objective genitive etc.) or an adverbial use (e.g. it can form a genitive that denotes cause etc.); it may form an exclamation (in poetry); it can also be the complement (object) of a preposition in any oblique case and denote many adverbial relations; finally, if in the genitive case, it can denote purpose, oftener a negative one. :: Demosthenes, 12 (Philippi epistula), 4 (The articular infinitive œÑ·Ω∏ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±ŒΩŒøŒºŒµ·øëŒΩ is somehow equivalent to the noun ·º° œÄŒ±œÅŒ±ŒΩŒøŒºŒØŒ± \\"the unlawfulness\\", and here in nominative case serves as the subject of the verb Œ¥ŒøŒ∫Œµ·øñ \\"seem, be-considered\\") :: To transgress the laws (= the act of transgressing the laws) against a herald and against ambassadors is considered by all other men to be impious. :: (as a predicative nominal in nominative), Plato, Gorgias, 483c (as a nominative apposition to the demonstrative pronoun ) :: This is (the definition of) injustice: to seek to have more than other people. :: Xenophon, Oeconomicus, 14.7 (as a dative complement of the verb ) :: Seeing that the lawful become richer than the unlawful, many, even though they are greedy of gain, very easily persist in not doing unjust acts. :: Dinarchus, 1 (In Demosthenem), 113 (as a dative complement of the preposition , denoting cause) :: He takes pride in being able to speak (= ...in his ability to speak) :: Plato, Gorgias, 489a (œÑ·Ω∏ ·ºÄŒ¥ŒπŒ∫Œµ·øñŒΩ is the subject of the verb ·Ω≤œÉœÑŒØŒΩ and œÑŒø·ø¶ ·ºÄŒ¥ŒπŒ∫Œµ·øñœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ serves as a genitive of comparison depended on the comparative degree adjective ) :: Wrong-doing is not only by convention more base than suffering it, but also by nature. :: Thucydides, Historiae, 2.32 (as a genitive of purpose) :: Œëtalante was fortified by the Athenians... to prevent pirates from ravaging Euboea. In all the preceding passages the articular infinitive is in the present tense stem; yet this is by no means a rule, since it can be used in any tense stem, denoting a variety of aspectual differences (For more details see below the discussion about the present and aorist dynamic infinitive). Infinitive without the article The infinitive without the article is of two sorts and has two discrete uses: the dynamic infinitive and the declarative infinitive.Madvig, J.N., Syntax der griechishen Sprache, besonders der attishen Sprachform, f√ºr Shulen. Braunsweig 1847, pp. 187ff.Rijksbaron, Albert. The syntax and semantics of the verb in classical Greek. The University of Chicago Press, 2006, pp. 96ff., ¬ß¬ß31ff. Traditionally they are said to be used not in indirect discourse and in indirect discourse respectively, yet this terminology is misleading; for infinitives of both sorts may be used in indirect discourse transformations (for example one may say (a) \\"I said that he will undertake an expedition\\" or (b) \\"I advised him to undertake/that he should undertake an expedition\\", where indirect discourse, one way and another, is employed: direct discourse for (a) \\"He will undertake...\\", and for (b) \\"Undertake/you should undertake...\\"). = Dynamic infinitive = A so-called dynamic infinitive may be governed by verbs of will or desire to do something ( or \\"to be willing, wish to\\", \\"pray, wish for\\", \\"pray against, imprecate curse to\\", \\"choose, prefer to\\", \\"to be about to, or: delay to\\", \\"urge, command to\\", \\"order to\\", \\"vote to\\", \\"allow to\\", \\"beg to\\" etc.), verbs of will or desire not to do anything ( \\"fear to\\", \\"be afraid to\\", \\"abstain from doing\\", \\"be ashamed to\\", \\"forbid to\\", \\"hinder, prevent\\" etc.) and verbs or verbal expressions denoting ability, fitness, necessity, capacity, etc. (, \\"be able to\\", , \\"know how to\\", \\"learn to\\", , \\"I am able to\\", \\"it is fair/right to\\", \\"it is necessary to\\", \\"it is time to\\" etc.). It can also be found after adjectives (and sometimes derived adverbs) of kindred meaning ( \\"skillful\\", \\"able\\", \\"able\\", \\"sufficient, capable\\" etc.). It stands as the object (direct or indirect) of such verbs or verbal expressions, or it serves as the subject if the verb/the verbal expression is used impersonally; it also defines the meaning of an adjective almost as an accusative of respect. An infinitive of this kind denotes only aspect or stage of action, not actual tense,William Watson Goodwin, Syntax of the Moods and Tenses of the Greek Verb. Cambridge University Press, Third edition, 1867, p.12 ¬ß 15; p. 22 ¬ß 18.2.b; p. 30 ¬ß 23.1; p. 212 ¬ß 106, REMARK. Henceforth quotations from the online version: ¬ß 96ff. ¬ß 87. and can be in any tense stem (mostly in the present and aorist (see also here), the perfect being rare enough) except the future one; only the verb \\"I am about to\\" may exceptionally take a dynamic future infinitive.William Watson Goodwin, Syntax of the Moods and Tenses of the Greek Verb ¬ß 73. The difference between the present and the aorist infinitive of this sort is aspect or stage of action, not the tense ‚Äîdespite their tense stem, such infinitives always have a future reference, because of the volitive meaning of their governing verb. More specifically, an infinitive in the present verb stem lays stress on \\"the process or course of the state of affairs\\", and in many cases has \\"an immediative\\" semantic force, while an infinitive in the aorist verb stem lays stress \\"on the completion of the state of affairs, expressing a well-defined or well-delineated state of affairs\\".Rijksbaron, Albert. The syntax and semantics of the verb in classical Greek. University of Chicago Press, 2006, pp. 102-103, ¬ß33.1, and pp. 44‚Äì45, ¬ß16.2. : Present dynamic infinitive (continuing stage of action): :: :: I want (for) you to go to Athens (=every time, or=to start/keep going to Athens etc.). :: :: It is necessary to fight (= to start/keep fighting). : Aorist dynamic infinitive (completed stage of action): :: :: I want (for) you to go to Athens. (just once, a simple and sole occurrence of going) :: .Plato, Apologia Socratis 22b :: I'm ashamed to tell you the truth. (just once, a simple occurrence of telling, as in the previous example) Analogous aspectual distinctions between the present and aorist verbal stem are present also in the use of finite moods as the imperative and the subjunctiveWilliam Watson Goodwin, \\"Syntax of the moods and tenses of the Greek verb\\",¬ß 89 and even the optative of wishesWilliam Watson Goodwin, \\"Syntax of the moods and tenses of the Greek verb\\"¬ß 94 in independent clauses.Rijksbaron, Albert. The syntax and semantics of the verb in classical Greek. The University of Chicago Press, 2006, pp. 39-48, ¬ß¬ß13-16 So, in cases as those presented in the following examples, a dynamic infinitive somehow recalls a corresponding finite mood expressing will or desire, pray or curse, exhortation or prohibition etc. and indirect discourse is from one aspect employed: :: Thucydides, Historiae, 6.102.2 (aorist dynamic infinitive) ::He ordered the servants to set fire to the war engines and timber. ::Direct speech form: (2nd plural person, aorist imperative mood) \\"Set fire to the war engines and timber.\\" ::Plato, Respublica, 394a (aorist dynamic infinitive) :: He prayed (to Apollo) that the Achaeans should suffer a penalty for his tears by means of his (:the god's) shafts. ::Direct speech form: . \\"Apollo, may the Achaeans suffer a penalty for my tears by means of your shafts\\". (aorist optative of wish, expressing curse) = Declarative infinitive = A so-called declarative infinitiveRijksbaron, Albert. The syntax and semantics of the verb in classical Greek. University of Chicago Press, 2006, pp. 106ff., ¬ß33.2. (see also declarative sentence) is mostly used in connexion with verbs (or verbal expressions) of saying, thinking and (sometimes) perceiving such as , , , , , , etc. and it is usually used in oratio obliqua (in indirect speech or indirect discourse). The latter means that it represents a corresponding finite verb form of the oratio recta (of the direct speech or discourse),William Watson Goodwin. Syntax of the moods and tenses of the Greek verb ¬ß¬ß 115, 683. thus a declarative infinitive denotes both tense and aspect or stage of action. But the present infinitive represents either a present indicative or an imperfect one,William Watson Goodwin. Syntax of the moods and tenses of the Greek verb , ¬ß 119 and a perfect infinitive either a perfect indicative or a pluperfect one.William Watson Goodwin. Syntax of the moods and tenses of the Greek verb, ¬ß 123 A declarative infinitive with the particle is also the representative of a potential indicative or potential optative of the corresponding tense. :: Xenophon, Hellenica, 2.3.24 (Present infinitive = present indicative) :: Men of the Senate, if anyone among you thinks that more people than the situation requires are being put to death, let him give consideration to the fact that these things happen wherever any system of government is transformed. :: Direct form: \\"More people are being put to death than the situation requires\\". :: Plato, Symposium, 176a (Aorist infinitive = aorist indicative; present infinitive = imperfect indicative)For the difference between the aorist and the imperfect in narration see: William Watson Goodwin, Syntax of the moods and tenses of the Greek verb, ¬ß 56 :: He said that they made drink offerings to the gods and they started betaking themselves to drinking. :: Direct form: \\"We made drink offerings to the gods and we started betaking ourselves to drinking\\". :: Plato, Theages, 129d Future infinitive = future indicative :: I think that he will die. :: Direct form: \\"He will die\\". :: Lysias, In Eratosthenem, 16 Future infinitive = future indicative. :: I was thinking that I would be released. :: Direct form: \\"I will be released\\". ::Thucydides, Historiae, 1.138.4 (Aorist infinitive = aorist indicative) :: But some people say that he died voluntarily by (drinking) poison. :: Direct form: \\"He died voluntarily by (drinking) poison\\". ::... (anaphoric to ) ::... which (anaphoric to \\"the fine these long orations\\") he said he had delivered as your spokesman before the Ten Thousand at Megalopolis in reply to Philip's champion Hieronymus. (the perfect infinitive can represent either a perfect indicative direct speech form \\"I have delivered orations\\" or a pluperfect one \\"I had delivered orations\\", the interpretation being left exclusively on contextual or deictic parameters) :: Demosthenes, 25 (In Aristogitonem, 30) Aorist potential infinitive = aorist potential optative. :: I think that he would deserve to be put to death even for what he is doing right now. :: Direct form: \\"He would deserve to be put to death\\". Verbs that usually have a future reference, such as \\"swear\\", \\"promise\\", \\"expect, hope\\", \\"threaten\\", \\"expect\\" etc., either take the declarative infinitive (mostly the future, but less often some of them also take the present, aorist or perfect infinitive, even the infinitive with the particle representing a potential optative or indicative), and in this case indirect discourse is employed, or they are followed by the dynamic aorist (less often the present) infinitive, and they are constructed just like any verb of will, desire etc.Rijksbaron, Albert. The syntax and semantics of the verb in classical Greek. The University of Chicago Press, 2006, p. 109, ¬ß33.1, and pp. 44‚Äì45, ¬ß16.2. The same constructional alternation is available in English (declarative content clause -a that clause- or to-infinitive), as shown below. :: (future, declarative, infinitive) :: I swear that I will give back the money. :: (present, dynamic, infinitive) :: I swear to start/keep giving back the money. :: (aorist, dynamic, infinitive) :: I swear to give the money back. For the difference between the present and aorist dynamic infinitive see the discussion in the above section. Yet in the last two examples another reading is also possible, considering and to be present and aorist declarative infinitive respectively: \\"I swear that I give (always, or in any relevant situation etc.) the money back. I swear that I gave the money back.\\" =The infinitive in subordinate clauses introduced by conjunctions= The (\\"dynamic\\") infinitive is used instead of the indicative mood, with substantial difference in meaning, in certain subordinate clauses introduced by specific conjunctions: \\"so as to, so that\\", () \\"before\\" or \\"until\\" and relative adjectives introducing relative clauses of result, such as \\"so much as enough to\\", \\"of such a short as to\\", or \\"(so...) that he could\\", in clauses introduced by the prepositional phrases or or with \\"with the proviso that\\". Note: a \\"declarative\\" infinitive is sometimes the mood of subordinated clauses in indirect speech, instead of a corresponding indicative (either a realis or conditional irrealis one) or optative mood, in modal assimilation to the main infinitive used to represent the independent clause of the direct speech; so after relative, temporal or conditional conjunctions such as: \\"who\\" or \\"whoever\\", or \\"since, when\\", \\"when\\", \\"if\\" etc.For examples see here: Willam Watson Goodwin, Syntax of the Moods and Tenses of the Greek Verb ¬ß 755. An example: :: Plato, Respublica 616b :: He said that after his soul had departed from his body, it marched accompanied by many others, and they arrived in a marvellous place, where there were two openings side by side in the ground and also two more in the sky in opposite positions. And that judges were seated between these openings... Here, the main infinitives, those directly depended on the finite verb , namely and , attractivelly affect the mood of the embedded clauses introduced by , a temporal conjunction, and , a relative prepositional phrase. :: The corresponding mood form of the direct narration would have been the indicative: :: After my soul had departed from my body, it was marching accompanied by many others, and we were arriving in a marvellous place, where there were two openings side by side in the ground and also two more in the sky in opposite position. And judges were seated between these openings... = Subject of the infinitive = In general, Greek is a pro drop language or a null-subject language: it does not have to express the (always in nominative case) subject of a finite verb form (either pronoun or noun), unless it is communicatively or syntactically important (e.g. when emphasis and/or contrast is intended etc.).Herbert Weir Smyth, A Greek Grammar for Colleges ¬ß¬ß 929-931 Concerning infinitives, no matter of which type, either articulated or not, and also either of the dynamic or declarative use, the following can be said as a general introduction to the infinitival syntax (:case rules for the infinitival subject): :(1) When the infinitive has a subject of its own (that is, when the subject of the infinitive is not co- referential either with the subject or the object of the governing verb form), then this word stands in the accusative case (Accusative and Infinitive).Herbert Weir Smyth, A Greek Grammar for Colleges ¬ß 936 :(2) When the subject of the infinitive is co-referential with the subject of the main verb, then it is usually neither expressed nor repeated within the infinitival clause (Nominative and Infinitive).Herbert Weir Smyth, A Greek Grammar for Colleges ¬ß 1973 :(3) When the infinitival subject is co-referential either with the object of the main verb or some other argument constructed in a higher syntactic level, eg. a dative of interest with an impersonal verb or verbal expression, then it is usually omitted within the infinitival clause, and any predicate adjective or participle etc. stands in whichsoever case the main verb's argument stands.Herbert Weir Smyth, A Greek Grammar for Colleges ¬ß 937 But it is not unusual at all that an accusative be present or‚Äîmore usually‚Äîunderstood by a predicate adjective, participle etc. in the accusative. These three main constructions available are desctribed in some detail in the sections below.  Accusative and infinitive  The construction where an accusative noun or pronoun functions as the subject of an infinitive is called accusative and infinitive (See also the homonymous Latin construction accusativus cum infinitivo (ACI), which is the rule -in indirect speech- even in cases where verb and infinitive have co-referential subjects). This construction can be used as an indirect speech mechanism, in many instances interchangeable with a complementary declarative clause introduced by \\"·ΩÖœÑŒπ/\\"·Ω°œÇ\\" William Watson Goodwin, Syntax of the Moods and Tenses of the Greek Verb ¬ß 753Herbert Weir Smyth, A Greek Grammar for Colleges ¬ß 2017 (or a supplementary participle).William Watson Goodwin, Syntax of the Moods and Tenses of the Greek Verb ¬ß 914 But with some verbs (normally with verbs of thinking, as , , , etc., with the verb \\"say, affirm, assert\\",Herbert Weir Smyth, A Greek Grammar for Colleges ¬ß 2018 with verbs denoting hope, oath or promise, such as \\"hope\\", \\"swear\\", \\"promise\\", etc.) the infinitival construction is the rule in classical Greek.William Watson Goodwin, Syntax of the Moods and Tenses of the Greek Verb ¬ß ¬ß136 Yet it can be also in use with any infinitival use, no matter whether indirect speech is involved or not.

(Articulated substantive -subject of the finite verb- and predicate adjective both in nominative case) And here is an example where no indirect speech is involved: :: .Lysias,13 (In Agoratum). 19 :: pro3rd pl wanted-they [seemINF himACC [unwillingACC and not willingACC informINF], so-that more-credible the revealing-of-information should-appear. literal translation (subject of the first infinitive in accusative, predicates with the second, embedded, infinitive in accusative also) :: Their will was that he could seem to be an informer unwillingly, and not willingly, so that the revealing of information should appear more credible. idiomatic translation This construction, accusative and infinitive, is also always in place when the main verb is an impersonal one or an impersonal verbal expression, and the infinitival clause functions as its subject (here also there is no indirect speech). Of course, in such cases the infinitive has a subject of its own. An example: :: [ ACC] ACC Lysias, 15 (In Alcibiadem 2).12 :: [YouACC] necessary-is [the same opinion having ACC the vote carry INF] literal translation (Subject of the infinitive is in accusative; the participle shows also concord with this pronominal form) :: It is necessary that you vote having the same opinion in mind. idiomatic translation  Nominative and infinitive  When the subject of the infinitive is identical (coreferential) with the subject of the governing verb, then normally it is omitted and understood in the nominative case. The phenomenon is traditionally understood to be some kind of case attraction K√ºhner, Raphael. Grammar of the Greek language for the use in high schools and colleges. (Translated by B. B. Edwards and S. H. Taylor). 1844. pp. 454‚Äì455: \\"When the subject of the governing verb... is at the same time the subject of the infinitive also, the subject is not expressed by the acc. of a personal promoun in Greek, as in Latin, but is wholly omitted, and when adjectives and substantives stand with the infinitive, to explain or define the predicate, they are put, by attraction, in the nominative\\". (for a modern perspective and relevant modern terminology see also big PRO and little pro and control constructions).

Note: there are certain cases where the subject of the infinitive, whether of the declarative or the dynamic type, is put in accusative case, eventhough it is co-referent with the subject of the main verb; in this mechanism emphasis or contrast is present. An example: :: œÉœáŒµŒ¥œåŒΩ œÑŒπ proi Œø·º∂ŒºŒ±Œπ [·ºêŒº·Ω≤i ACC œÄŒªŒµŒØœâ œáœÅŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒ± Œµ·º∞œÅŒ≥Œ¨œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ ·º¢ ·ºÑŒªŒªŒøœÖœÇ œÉœçŒΩŒ¥œÖŒøACC [Œø·ΩïœÉœÑŒπŒΩŒ±œÇ Œ≤ŒøœçŒªŒµŒπ] œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ œÉŒøœÜŒπœÉœÑ·ø∂ŒΩ].Plato, Hippias Major, 282e :: almost in-some-degree proi think-I [meACC more money have-earnedINF than othersACC two-togetherACC [whoever like-you] of-the sopisths].

(idiomatic translation) Here the unemphatic dropped null-subject (if emphatic, a 1st person pronoun ·ºêŒ≥œéi NOM should be present) of the main verb is emphatically repeated right after the verb within the infinitival clause in accusative case (·ºêŒºŒ≠, \\"I\\"). The meaning is ‚ÄòI believe that it is I who have made more money than any other two sophists together ‚Äì you may choose whoever you like‚Äô.

Subject omitted and understood in an oblique case (genitive, dative or accusative)  When the infinitival subject is coreferent with a word constructed with the governing verb in a higher syntactic level, in other words, when the subject of the infinitive is itself (a second) argument of the governing verb, then it is normally omitted and understood either in the oblique case in which the second argument is put (see also in the previous paragraph the reference to PRO and control structures), or in the accusative as if in an accusative and infinitive construction (but with the accusative noun or pronoun obligatorily suppressed and implied). :: i DAT DAT Xenophon, Anabasis, 7.1.21 :: now for-youDAT, Xenophon, is-possible [PROi man DAT become INF]. literal translation :: Now it is possible for you, Xenophon, [to become a man]. idiomatic translation :: (Predicate noun \\"a man\\" in case agreement with the dative \\"for you\\".) :: i GEN GEN Xenophon, Hellenica, 1.5.2 :: CyrusI GEN pro were-begging-they [PROi as- zeal-as-possibleGEN towards the war beINF]. literal translation :: They were begging Cyrusi [to be as zeali as possible in the war]. idiomatic translation :: (Predicate adjective \\"willing\\" shows case agreement with the genitive object .) :: Œ†ŒøŒªŒ≠ŒºŒ±œÅœáŒøœÇ ·ΩÅ ŒöŒµœÜŒ¨ŒªŒøœÖ ·ºêŒ∫Œ≠ŒªŒµœÖœÉŒµ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩACC œÄŒ±·øñŒ¥Œ± i ACC [PROi Œ¥œÅŒ±ŒºœåŒΩœÑŒ±ACC [œÄŒµœÅŒπŒºŒµ·øñŒΩŒ±ŒØ ·ºë] Œ∫ŒµŒªŒµ·ø¶œÉŒ±Œπ (·º°Œº·æ∂œÇ) .Plato, Respublica, 327.b :: Polemarchus the of-Cephalus ordered theACC ladACC [runningACC [waitINF for- him] orderINF (us) . literal translation :: Polemarchus the son of Cephalus ordered his lad [to run and bid (us) [wait for him . idiomatic translation In all the above examples the case of the subject of the infinitive is governed by the case requirements of the main verb and \\"the infinitive is appended as a third argument\\"Rijksbaron, Albert.

(Concerning the second and third examples, in modern linguistic terms we have to do with an object control construction). As fas as the two first are concerned, traditionally this construction is sometimes called (in Latin terminology) dativus cum infinitivo or genitivus cum infinitivo (dative with the infinitive or genitive with the infinitive respectively) and is considered to be a case attraction,K√ºhner, Raphael.

Pp. 453-454.Herbert Weir Smyth, A Greek Grammar for Colleges, ¬ß 1060 ff. the dative or genitive being used instead of a predicate in the accusative: ; see also below. On the other hand, as it is indicated by predicate adjectives/sunstantives or participial constituents of the infinitival clause, it is not unusual at all for an accusative to be understood and be supplied by context as the subject of the infinitive, as the following examples illustrate. As far as the genitive is concerned, a predicate substantive or a participle normally stands in the accusative while an adjective may stand either in accusative or in genitive case. As far as the dative is concerned, the choice between a word in concord with a dative and an accusative case seems to be laid down by the speaker's/writer's preference.Herbert Weir Smyth, A Greek Grammar for Colleges, ¬ß¬ß 1061-1062. :: i DAT ACC Thucydides, Historiae, 4.20.3. :: For-LacedaemoniansDAT is-possible [to-you friendsACC] becomeINF]. literal translation :: It is possible for Lacedaemonians [to become friends to you]. idiomatic translation :: (Predicate adjective \\"friends\\" is in the accusative, in case agreement with an understood and omitted accusative subject \\"Lacedaemonians\\". It might be possible that the accusative is preferred by Thucydides here in order to avoid an accumulation of datives that would produce ambiguity or even incomprehensibility: ŒõŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒ¥Œ±ŒπŒºŒøŒΩŒØŒøŒπœÇ-œÖŒº·øñŒΩ-œÜŒØŒªŒøŒπœÇ) :: GEN [ACC Isocrates 14 (Plataicus).6. :: are- begging-we then of-youGEN [listen-carefullyINF of-what-is-being-said, keeping- in-mindACC that...] literal translation :: We are begging you then [to listen carefully of what is said, keeping in mind that...] idiomatic translation :: (Participle \\"keeping in mind\\" in the accusative, agreeing in case with an omitted/understood accusative \\"you\\".) This construction is obligatory when the infinitive is governed by a participle in any oblique case, more usually an attributive one (and in the nominative also).Herbert Weir Smyth, A Greek Grammar for Colleges, ¬ß 1973.c. Here the predicate adjective always shows concord with the case of the leading participle. So an embedded participial clause like \\"claiming that they are wise\\" or \\"Those who claim that they are wise\\" is declined this way -in any of the following word ordering, but in slightly different each time meaning (see topicalization and focusing): :: NOM :: ACC :: GEN GEN :: DAT DAT In the above phrasal structuring the predicate adjective \\"wise\\" is always put in the case of its governing participle \\"claiming\\".

The aim of the offensive was to establish a new supply line into Aleppo city, after an Army-initiated summer campaign had cut off all rebel access to Aleppo. The rebels called the operation \\"the mother of all battles\\", or \\"the grand battle of Aleppo\\", and described it as possibly deciding the outcome of the war. After making early advances, the rebel offensive soon slowed and stalled. By mid-November, government troops regained control of all areas lost at the start of the rebel offensive, as well as areas lost in the earlier rebel offensive during the summer campaign. The offensive Map of the rebel offensive On 28 October, rebel forces outside Aleppo fired more than 150 shells, mainly BM-21 Grad rockets, at western Aleppo and the Aleppo International Airport, killing more than 15 civilians and wounding at least 100. Rebel groups then announced that they had begun an offensive against the city after detonating three suicide car bombs,3 suicide car attacks target regime forces in Aleppo leading to violent clashes one of which was a tank driven by a French Jabhat Fateh al-Sham suicide bomber. The Army also reportedly destroyed two or four other car bombs. Rebels in tanks, armored vehicles, bulldozers, makeshift mine sweepers, pick-up trucks and on motorcycles approached the city. The offensive took place along a 15-kilometer stretch of the frontline.Rebels advance over regime forces in Aleppo Following the attack by the suicide-bombers on the western outskirts of the city, the rebels seized the Minyan Sawmills, Al-Surah Checkpoint,15 killed while 100 injured by missiles targeted western Aleppo the Cardboard Factory and most of the Dahiyat Al-Assad suburb,The Factions win the first round of the grand battle of Aleppo and control most of al-Assad Suburb while government troops withdrew to the eastern side of the district so they would not be overrun. Concurrently, a rebel attack from the southwest in the area of the 1070 Housing Project was repelled, with one rebel tank destroyed and the Army retaining its presence in the northeast section of the Housing Project. Rebel attacks on the nearby 3000 Housing Project and the northwestern Zahra district were also repelled. In all, up to eight car bombs, some remotely controlled, were detonated or destroyed at the start of the offensive. In the evening, the Army launched several surface-to-surface missiles on rebel positions in the west of the city.

The rebels also launched their own assault on the New Aleppo district and the 1070 and 3000 Housing Projects, where two suicide car bombers blew themselves up. A rebel tank and a technical were destroyed in the fighting at the 3000 Housing Project. During the clashes, the rebels reportedly shelled a residential area of the Hamdaniyah district with chlorine gas, leaving one civilian dead and 15 people injured. The rebels denied this and claimed government forces had themselves used poison gas at one point of the frontline. Ultimately, the rebel attack on the 3000 Housing Project as well as the nearby military complex was repelled. By 31 October, the rebel offensive had slowed due to heavy government resistance and pro-government forces had taken the initiative. Three days into the offensive, the rebels were in control of the Minyan Industrial district, most of the Dahiyat Al-Assad district and half of the Minyan residential district. The frontline had stabilized and settled into a stalemate.

They managed to advance and capture several positions. The rebels also assaulted the 3000 Housing Project and the Al-Assad Military Academy. During the clashes, another rebel tank was destroyed, as well as two Army anti-tank positions. Still, the rebels were not able to break into New Aleppo and their assault was repelled.

By this point, government forces had regained control of all areas lost at the start of the rebel offensive, as well as areas lost in the earlier rebel offensive during the summer campaign. Aftermath Following the successful campaign by pro-government forces, the rebels in eastern-Aleppo were given 24 hours to surrender before the Army started an offensive to completely recapture the rebel-held districts in the east. After the offensive, food and medicine were reportedly smuggled from the YPG-held Sheikh Maqsood into rebel-held eastern Aleppo. International reactions Amnesty International stated that the \\"armed opposition groups have displayed a shocking disregard for civilian lives\\", deploying weapons \\"whose use in the vicinity of densely populated civilian areas flagrantly violates international humanitarian law\\". The organization called the rebel groups to \\"end all attacks that fail to distinguish between military targets and civilians\\". The United Nations special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, expressed that he was \\"appalled and shocked\\" by the attacks targeting civilians in Aleppo. He later stated that some rebel groups had been preventing civilians leaving eastern Aleppo.

It has a single spreading, hairy leaf and a single green to apricot-coloured flower. It is a small orchid and difficult to find, even when quite abundant in a particular location. It is found in the far south- west corner of the state, unlike subspecies cracens which grows near Kalbarri. Description Caladenia bryceana subsp. bryceana is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf long and about wide. A single green to apricot-coloured flower is borne on a stem high and is long and wide. The lateral sepals and petals are short and spreading. The labellum is green to apricot-coloured, has a red tip and smooth edges. There is a dense band of tall calli along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs between August and October and is followed by a non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing a large number of seeds. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia bryceana was first formally described by Richard Rogers in 1914 but in 2001 Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown described two subspecies, including subspecies bryceana and the description of the two subspecies was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (bryceana) honours Bryce MacIntyre, who first collected the species in 1914. Distribution and habitat Dwarf spider orchid occurs in the south-west corner of Western Australia between Boyup Brook and Boxwood Hill in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions where it grows in shrubland and woodland, often near watercourses.

Numismatists include collectors, specialist dealers and scholars who use coins in object-based research. Although the term numismatics was first coined in English in 1829, people had been collecting and studying coins long before this, all over the world. The first group chiefly derive pleasure from the simple ownership of monetary devices and studying these coins as private amateur scholars. In the classical field amateur collector studies have achieved quite remarkable progress in the field. Examples are Walter Breen, a well-known example of a noted numismatist who was not an avid collector, and King Farouk I of Egypt was an avid collector who had very little interest in numismatics. Harry Bass by comparison was a noted collector who was also a numismatist. The second group are the coin dealers. Often called professional numismatists, they authenticate or grade coins for commercial purposes. The buying and selling of coin collections by numismatists who are professional dealers advances the study of money, and expert numismatists are consulted by historians, museum curators, and archaeologists. See, for example, the International Association of Professional Numismatists (IAPN) and the British Numismatic Trade Association (BNTA). The third category are scholar numismatists working in public collections, universities or as independent scholars acquiring knowledge about monetary devices, their systems, their economy and their historical context. Coins are especially relevant as a source in the pre- modern period.  Training and recognition  There are very few academic institutions around the world that offer formal training in numismatics. Some may offer numismatics as part of a course in classical studies, ancient history, history or archaeology. Scholar numismatists may focus on numismatics at postgraduate level, where the training is more research-based. As a result, most scholar numismatists will approach numismatics from within another academic discipline (e.g. history, archaeology, ancient or modern languages, metal sciences), perhaps after attending a numismatic summer school, usually based where there is an excellent coin collection. Recognition of scholarly numismatic expertise may be in the form of a postgraduate qualification, and/or in the form of a medal awarded by a numismatic society: for example, the Medal of the Royal Numismatic Society, which may be awarded to scholar numismatists of any nationality. Donald H. Kagin earned the first PhD in Numismatics granted in the United States in 1979.

It belongs today to Random House publishing group based in Munich. The publishing house is mainly known for its library of world literature. It also publishes first and new translations of classical works. Manesse is directed by Horst Lauinger.  History  Walther Meier founded the Manesse Verlag in Z√ºrich in 1944. Two years earlier, he had discussed the idea of a \\"world literary library\\" for classical literature, with the printing house Conzett & Huber. The name of the publishing house was based on the Codex Manesse. The first two works published by Manesse Verlag in 1944 were \\"Moby Dick\\" by Herman Melville translated by Fritz G√ºttinger and \\"Goethe im Gespr√§ch\\" (Goethe in Conversation) by Eduard Korrodi. In the mid 1950s, the 100th volume of the so-called Manesse Library of World Literacy was published, \\"Deutsche Lyrik des Mittelalters\\" (German Lyric of the Middle Ages) by Max Wehrli, and in 2004 came the 600th volume, Henry Fielding's \\"Tom Jones\\". After Walther Meier had handed over the management of the publishing house to Federico Hindermann in the early 1970s, Conzett & Huber completely separated from Manesse in 1983. The publisher became an independent company and was taken over by the Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt. After the turn of the millennium, Horst Lauinger followed Anne Marie Wells as the publisher. In September 2005, it was announced that the Random House publishing group wanted to take over the book publishers of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, including Manesse, DVA and the K√∂sel Verlag. The purchase price was, according to media reports, in the lower double-digit million range. From viewers, the purchase was labeled as a \\"late development of the newspaper industry\\". Publishers of competing companies warned against further concentration of the industry. It was feared in particular that the diversity of the German book market would be jeopardized. Random House publishing group took over all shares in the Manesse Verlag GmbH and was therefore the sole shareholder. Manesse is a programmatic and publicly independent publisher of the company today. The corresponding company was deleted from the commercial register.  Program  \\"A Question of Guilt\\" (2008) Manesse is a classic publishing house that mainly publishes new and first translations. In the publishing house, works by authors such as Jane Austen, Herman Bang, Tania Blixen, Elizabeth Gaskell, Eduard von Keyserling, Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, Nizami Ganjavi, Italo Svevo, and Jun'ichir≈ç Tanizaki were published. In 1994 Manesse published \\"German Narrators of the 20th Century\\" by Marcel Reich-Ranicki. The publisher achieved a great deal of recognition in 2001 with \\"Eine Bluttat, ein Betrug und ein Bund f√ºrs Leben\\" (A Murder, a Mystery, and a Marriage) by Mark Twain. The narrative was published in a translation by Frank Heibert and an epilogue by Georg Klein published at the same time as the American original. Among the best known works of the publishing house are Sophia Tolstaya's \\"Eine Frage der Schuld\\" (A question of guilt) and \\"101 Nacht\\" (101 nights). All the volumes of the World Literary Library are thread-bound, bound in linen, and equipped with a reading tape. The name of the author and the titles of the book are usually in gold on the back of the book. Each volume contains an epilogue by a contemporary author, literary critic or literary scholar.

It has been developed by the Swiss Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation and the French bank Natixis. The aim of the standard is twofold: it not only guides project owners to develop infrastructure projects that perform highly with regard to sustainability and resilience aspects ‚Äî taking into account social, environmental and governance criteria and best practices ; it also serves as a tool to communicate the sustainability and resilience benefits to potential investors, thus channelling more financial flows into infrastructure development and boosting sustainable socioeconomic development globally. The Standard was launched at 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21). SuRe¬Æ is governed by three bodies (Secretariat, Standard Committee and Stakeholder Council) in an effort to maintain a balanced representation of stakeholders in the standard development and provide transparent and due process safeguards while ensuring independence, transparency and credibility. GIB has also developed the SuRe¬Æ SmartScan, a simplified version of the SuRe¬Æ Standard which serves as a self-assessment tool for infrastructure project developers. It provides them with a comprehensive and time-efficient analysis of the various themes covered by the SuRe¬Æ Standard, offering a solid foundation for projects that are planning to become certified by the SuRe¬Æ Standard in the future. Upon completion of the SmartScan, project developers receive a spider diagram evaluation, which indicates their project‚Äôs performance in the different themes and benchmarks the performances with other SmartScan assessed projects.http://www.sunwindenergy.com/content/sure-global- infrastructure-standard-sustainable-future References Category:Sustainable urban planning ","title":"SuRe"},{"id":"52122013","text":"Romain Ruffenach (born 4 September 1994) is a French Rugby Union player.

The bronze statues at the top of the memorial represent three local participants in the Easter Rising: Tom Clarke, Ned Daly and Con Colbert., alongside a figure representing Mother Ireland. The monument is configured around a stone plinth that previously held a statue of Viscount Fitzgibbon, of Mountshannon House, who was killed during The Charge of the Light Brigade in the Crimean War, and which was blown up by nationalists in 1930. The memorial was unveiled on Sunday 27 May 1956, by Leslie de Barra, the wife of former Republican leader Thomas Barry. In her speech, she paid tribute to the \\"weary and patient work\\" and the \\"courageous example\\" of those involved in the Rising. Patrick Hillery represented the Irish government at the 1966 Golden Jubilee commemoration in 1966, reviewing the troops who participated in the ceremony.

Each season focuses on a different theme from the areas of politics and society. In moderated discussions held every four to six weeks before an audience of international guests, invited experts discuss topics from the areas of politics, culture, technology, media, and the human and natural sciences. The series has been organised and moderated by Carolin Emcke since 2004. Emcke states at the opening of each event that Streitraum is not a forum for arguments and conflict but rather an opportunity to watch people think. Each session ends with questions from the audience. Jason Farago of BBC Culture has regarded Streitraum as \\"an intelligent and aggressive public lecture series\\".  A season as an example  The theme of the 2014‚Äì15 season was ' (In search of democracyor: Publicity and mistrust). The season opened with ', a discussion with Deirdre Curtin, professor of European law, on the role of the economy and secret services in politics. In the second event, Alain Badiou and Thomas Ostermeier discussed the legitimacy and authority of democracy from the perspective of philosophy and theatre. Two discussions were dedicated to the conflict in Russia and the Ukraine. The title ' (When I think of Russia ..., after Heine's ') was given to the discussions between Emcke and her guestswho included Alice Bota, Nino Haratischwili and Katja Petrowskajaabout the relevance of fiction to an evaluation of the actual political situation in these regions. Another discussion, ? (Far-right politicsin the blind spot of democracy?), with , , and Antonia von der Behrens, covered German domestic policy, focusing on the NSU. Flyer for the event Misstrauen und √ñffentlichkeit on 22 March 2015 A month later Emcke and her guest, the Indian-American author Suketu Mehta, explored the relationship between people and their cities, while the following discussion, ' (Misrust and publicity), with , Bernhard P√∂rksen and Sonja Zekri, focused on the crisis of trust in journalism. The next event was related to a play performed at the Schaub√ºhne, Milo Rau's The Civil Wars, which was in 2015 part of the Festival Internationale Neue Dramatik (F.I.N.D.). The author Gudrun Kr√§mer and politician Franziska Brantner () discussed with Emcke the ' (Questioning the idea of Europe, in the light of radicalism, less solidarity, and violence). In the final event, Klaus Theweleit drew connections between his analysis of ' (The desire to kill) and the political discourse on violence.  Streitraum Extra  Occasionally, events unrelated to the season's theme are held under the name of Streitraum Extra. For example, the Streitraum Extra discussions of 2013 included \\" (Asylum in Germany?); ', with David Grossman; and ' (Power, Sexuality, and Violence), with . The December 2015 Streitraum Extra was dedicated to refugees with a reading of pertinent texts, with Lars Eidinger, Nina Hoss, , Ter√©zia Mora, Thomas Ostermeier, Katja Petrowskaja, Najem Wali, Liao Yiwu, and Carolin Emcke participating.

Three gunmen attacked worshippers attending a church service at Mountain Lodge Pentecostal Church, killing three Protestant civilians and wounding seven. The attackers were rogue members of the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). They claimed responsibility using the cover name \\"Catholic Reaction Force\\", saying it was retaliation for recent sectarian attacks on Catholics by the loyalist \\"Protestant Action Force\\". Background In the months before the Darkley killings, several Catholic civilians were killed by loyalists. On 29 October 1983, a Catholic civilian member of the Workers' Party, David Nocher (26), was shot dead in Belfast.McKittrick, Lost Lives, pp.956-957 On 8 November, Catholic civilian Adrian Carroll (24) was shot dead in Armagh, for which four British soldiers were later convicted. Carroll was the brother of an INLA member who was killed a year earlier.\\"Gunmen Fire Into Ulster Church; 3 Protestants Killed, 7 Wounded\\". The New York Times. 21 November 1983. These attacks were claimed by the \\"Protestant Action Force\\" (PAF), a cover name used mostly by members of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). It is believed the Darkley killings were primarily a retaliation for the killing of Carroll. Attack On the evening of Sunday 20 November, about sixty people were attending a church service at Mountain Lodge Pentecostal Church. The small, isolated wooden church was outside the village of Darkley, near the border with the Republic of Ireland and several miles from Armagh. As the service began, three masked gunmen arrived, at least one of whom was armed with a Ruger semi-automatic rifle and opened fire on those standing in the entrance. Three church elders were killed: Harold Browne (59), Victor Cunningham (39) and David Wilson (44). The fatally wounded Wilson staggered into the service, where he collapsed and died. The gunmen then stood outside the building and sprayed it with bullets, wounding a further seven people, before fleeing in a car.\\"Gunmen Fire Into Ulster Church; 3 Protestants Killed, 7 Wounded\\". The New York Times. 21 November 1983. The service was being tape-recorded when the attack took place. On the tape, the congregation can be heard singing the hymn, \\"Are You Washed in the Blood of the Lamb\\", followed by the sound of gunfire. All of the victims were Protestant civilians. Aftermath In a telephone call to a journalist, a caller claimed responsibility for the attack on behalf of the \\"Catholic Reaction Force\\". He said it was \\"retaliation for the murderous sectarian campaign carried out by the Protestant Action Force\\" and added, \\"By this token retaliation we could easily have taken the lives of at least 20 more innocent Protestants. We serve notice on the PAF to call an immediate halt to their vicious indiscriminate campaign against innocent Catholics, or we will make the Darkley killings look like a picnic\\". The caller named nine Catholics who had been attacked. The name \\"Catholic Reaction Force\\" had never been used before, and police said they believed the attack was carried out by members of the INLA. The INLA condemned the attack and denied direct involvement, but said it was investigating the involvement of INLA members or weapons.The Starry Plough. November/December 1983 issue. p.5 A week later, INLA leader Dominic McGlinchey admitted that one of the gunmen had been an INLA member and admitted supplying him with the gun,Ireland's Terrorist Dilemma. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1986. pp.104-105 but said there was no justification for the attack. The INLA member's brother had been killed by loyalists. McGlinchey explained that the INLA member had asked him for a gun to shoot a known loyalist who had been involved in sectarian killings. However, \\"clearly deranged by the death of his brother\\", he \\"used it instead to attack the Darkley Gospel Hall\\".Coogan, Tim. The IRA. Palgrave Macmillan, 2002. pp.535-536 McGlinchey said: \\"he must have been unbalanced or something to have gone and organised this killing. We are conducting an inquiry\\". On 5 December, fifteen days after the Darkley attack, the PAF shot dead INLA member Joseph Craven (26) in Newtownabbey. The name \\"Catholic Reaction Force\\" was used several other times. In May 1986 it was used to claim the killing of Protestant civilian David Wilson (39), who was shot while driving his firm's van in Donaghmore. The IRA also claimed responsibility, saying Wilson was a member of the UDR.McKittrick, Lost Lives, p.1037 The \\"Catholic Reaction Force\\" declared a ceasefire on 28 October 1994.

It is a medium-sized tree with soft, papery, fibrous bark on the lower trunk, smooth white to pale cream-coloured bark above, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, orange-coloured flowers and oval to urn-shaped fruit. The flower buds and fruit have distinct ribs along their sides. Description Eucalyptus chartaboma is a tree that grows to a height of up to , often with several stems, and forms a lignotuber. The bark on the lower trunk is soft, fibrous and papery, brownish to white, smooth white to cream-coloured above. The leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are egg-shaped, dull green, long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, a paler shade of dull green on the lower side, long and wide. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual flowers sessile or on a pedicel up to long. Mature buds are glaucous, spindle-shaped to diamond-shaped, long and wide, with ribs along the sides and a conical operculum. Flowering occurs between January and April and the flowers are orange. The fruit is a woody truncated oval to urn-shaped capsule long and wide, with ribs along the sides and the valves enclosed. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus chartaboma was first formally described in 2000 by Dean Nicolle from a specimen collected north of Mount Garnet and the description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (chartaboma) is derived from the Ancient Greek words charte meaning \\"leaf of paper\\" and bomos meaning \\"base\\", \\"stand\\" or \\"altar\\", referring to papery bark on the trunk of this eucalypt. Distribution and habitat Paperbark gum usually grows on low hills and occurs in scattered locations near Croydon, Einasleigh and Mount Garnet, then as far north as Maitland Downs on the southern Cape York Peninsula.

It is a large two- story brick building, with flat roof and concrete foundation. It has a raised basement, separated from the main floors by a stone stringcourse. The main facade is divided into three large bays defined by slightly recessed panels. The outer bays have bands of five sash windows on each floor, while the center bay has windows in a 1-3-1 pattern on the second floor, and single windows flanking the recessed entrance on the raised ground floor. The roof line has a modillioned and dentillated cornice, and is topped by a parapet that is gabled at the center. with The city of St. Albans experienced significant growth between 1874 and 1910, resulting in the construction of a number of elementary schools. Crowding continued to be a problem, and this school was built in 1911 to address that issue. It served the city as an elementary school until 1970, when the St. Albans Elementary School opened, consolidating all of the city's elementary school students into a single facility.

History The Franciscans arrived to Loro Piceno by 1362, and likely soon after founded a monastery and adjacent church. The latter was consecrated in 1372. The monastery was suppressed only by the Napoleonic invasion, and even afterward some five monks returned after the complex was reassigned to the order after the restoration of Papal government. By then much of the convent became used for other activities including a school. The sacristy had been used in the 18th century as a town archive. Between the seventeenth and nineteenth century, the total number altars inside the church was reduced to five. In 1793, the wooden choir stalls were moved. The conterfacade held an organ built by Gaetano Callido. The front of the nave once had wooden benches reserved for the nobility of the town; these were moved to the council chamber. Also lost from the church is a 19th-century silver bas-relief designed by sculptor Luigi Fontana of Montesampietrangeli; the bas relief had been made as a votive offering to the Virgin for an event, interpreted as miraculous, occurring in October 1858, when during the recitation of the Rosary, lightning struck the church, but left all the parishioners inside unharmed. In 1828 Luigi Silvestri built the chapel of the Santissimo Crocifisso, to display a copy of the Crucifix of Lanciano. The church underwent a major restoration in 1956-1958. The church still maintains rich collections of paintings. In houses on one of the altars a wooden Madonna of the Rosary (1680), attributed to Sebastiano Sebastiani. In the lateral altars are paintings depicting: *The Apparition of the Virgin to the Blessed Liberato during his illness *The Temptation of St Anthony Abott *St. Anthony of Padua (1771) by Filippo de Conti *The Ecstasy of St Joseph of Cupertino *A Madonna of Loreto *The Blessed Liberato praying with his companions Umile and Pacifico (1924) derived from the Gabinetto del Sindaco nel Palazzo Municipale. The main altarpiece depicts a Madonna del Rosario (Madonna of the Rosary), painted in 1581-1590, and attributed to Giuseppe Bastiani of Macerata, who often painted mannerist, provincial devotional subjects, and a pupil of Gaspare Gasparini and follower of the Zuccari. The work was commissioned by the Confraternity of the Rosary, founded in 1573, and officiating at an altar in this church. The painting has a complex iconography: it contains a central scene and is garlanded around the frame with fifteen scenes representing the Mysteries of the Rosary. The central scene depicts and enthroned Madonna and child Jesus with angels: nearest to them, the Madonna passes St Dominic the rosary, while the Child Jesus gives St Francis a red cross. These two saints are flanked in the central panel includes the next most prominent Dominican and Franciscan male and female saints: respectively, standing, St Peter Martyr and St Anthony of Padua; and kneeling, St Catherine of Siena and St Clare of Assisi. The canvas is also crowded below with both religious and secular leaders showing devotion to the institutions of the rosary and cross. Some identify among them Pope Pius V, a former Dominican friar; Cardinal Carlo Bonelli, Pius' nephew; John of Austria, the Spanish admiral for King Phillip II of Spain. All were leaders in forming coalition that checked the Ottoman navy in the Battle of Lepanto. Pope Pius V had called for prayers of the Rosary prior to the battle, and afterward declared the Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary is on October 7, would be held on the anniversary of the 1571 battle. The fifteen scenes are represented by the five Joyful (gaudiosi), five Sorrowful (dolorosi), and five Glorious (gloriosi) Mysteries.Comune of Loro Piceno, entry on church by Chiara Negromanti Tini.

The farm has seen agricultural use since 1804, and the patterns of use are evident in the surviving farm buildings and landscape. The property, is still actively farmed and also used as a retreat center and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history Knoll Farm is located in an upland area above the village of Fayston, and is bounded on its west by Bragg Hill Road. The farm property consists of about , with a broad open area extending east from the farm complex, which stands near Bragg Hill Road. The eastern and northern portions of the property are a steeper hillside area, historically used for timber production, is now the home for a nationally respected retreat center. The open areas of the farm are a combination of pasture, hay fields, and gardens. The farmstead is separated from the road by an old alignment of Bragg Hill Road, which now serves as a parking area for farm visitors. The farmstead complex includes a 1904 wood-frame farmhouse, a mid-to-late 19th century bank barn set between the old and new alignments of the road, and a second c. 1880 barn east of the house that was moved to this site from the valley below in 1923. with This property was first farmed in the early 19th century by Rufus Barrett. It was considered a favorable property due to its extensive southern exposure, which provided for early snow melt and a longer growing season. Unlike larger farm properties in the Mad River below, its proprietors did not specialize, engaging in a diverse variety of farming activities. It was owned between 1874 and 1935 by three generations of the McLaughlin family, and most of its buildings date to their period of ownership. Farming for profit ended on the property with the McLaughlin's sale of the property in 1935, at which time it became an inn serving the automobile tourist trade. Low-level agricultural activities have continued on the property since then, including by recent ownership, which raises sheep and blueberries while also operating a small conference center on the site. Knoll Farm was purchased in 1957 by Ann Day and family who stewarded the property for 50 years and connected the farm to a new generation of social and environmental activism. In the 1980s Ann began traveling to Nicaragua through the American Friends Service Committee and made Knoll Farm a place of refuge for people fleeing the civil war for asylum in Canada. Ann would also honor the nature and history of Knoll Farm by making one of the earliest conservation agreements to permanently protect the land in 1982 with the Vermont Land Trust. In 2001, the current owners of Knoll Farm, Peter Forbes, Helen Whybrow and their family, purchased the farm from Ann Day and Vermont Land Trust after being chosen in a competition to bring a new vision to the farm. Active farming returned to Knoll Farm then as did a new generation of ‚Äúnatural-build‚Äù buildings which reflect the new owner's commitment to environmental sustainability and education. In 2004, Forbes and Whybrow created Center for Whole Communities, a nonprofit leadership organization, which gathered thousands of social justice and environmental activists and leaders at the farm for a period of 12 years. In 2008, the farm returned to running entirely on wood and sun, a source of energy for the farm that had been replaced by fossil fuels in the 1940s. Today, Knoll Farm is a model working farm specializing in organic fruit production, Icelandic sheep, solar energy production and being a place of refuge for community leaders from around the United States.

Background The first version of the Ecological Corridors of Tropical Forests of Brazil proposal was developed by a group of consultants at the request of the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment and presented in the first half of 1997. Seven major corridors were proposed: the Central Amazon Ecological Corridor, Northern Amazon Ecological Corridor, South Amazon Ecological Corridor, South Amazon Ecotones Ecological Corridor, Western Amazon Ecological Corridor, Central Atlantic Forest Ecological Corridor and Serra do Mar Ecological Corridor. These corresponded to about 25% of the rainforests of Brazil. Priority was given to the Central Amazon Corridor and the Central Atlantic Forest Corridor, which would test and develop the concepts for use with the subsequent corridors. Proposed scope The Northern Amazon Ecological Corridor was one of five Amazon region corridors identified. It would cover the northern Amazon border with Colombia and Venezuela. There would be six priority areas in three main Amazon ecoregions. The corridor was identified as being relatively intact, globally important for its biological distinction, and high priority on a regional scale. The corridor would have an area of . Conservation units would include the Amazonas National Forest, Marac√° Ecological Station, Pico da Neblina National Park and Roraima National Forest. The proposal also included the Cubat√©, Cuiari, I√ßana, Pari Cachoeira II, Piraiauara, Tarauac√° I, Tarauac√° II and Uru√ßu national forests.

Retrieved 28 October 2016 The hotel along with surrounding buildings including 18 Cathedral Yard and The Well House Tavern were severely damaged by fire in October 2016. All of three damaged buildings are currently undergoing a major restoration. On 25 July 2017 restoration plans were unveiled by the hotelier Andrew Brownsword. The restoration work is being undertaken by construction consultants Thomasons, in partnership with Manchester architects Buttress, Historic England and Exeter City Council. On 6 August 2019, it was announced that Andrew Brownsword Hotels had put the site up for sale. The reopening date is currently unknown.The site was sold in August 2020 to James Brent of South West Lifestyle Brands limited. The Royal Clarence Hotel fa√ßades will be reconstructed when the restoration work continues and it will reopen as 74 Bedroom hotel. History Before the Reformation, the land which was to become the site of the hotel was part of the accommodation for Exeter Cathedral's Vicars choral. The site was later leased to a variety of tenants until in March 1766 the Reverend John Lee of Lympstone assigned the lease of the premises that he held there to William Mackworth Praed (1747‚Äì1833).Marsh (2017), pp. 1‚Äì3. Praed was a son of William Mackworth Praed, a lawyer and politician who had died in 1752. At the time of the transfer, part of the premises leased by John Lee was occupied by an under-tenant, a French school master named Peter Berlon, and Praed engaged him to manage the planned development of the site. Praed acquired other adjacent premises too, including the freehold of a property half way along St Martin's Lane, and dilapidated property in High Street, which he redeveloped separately.Marsh (2017), pp. 3‚Äì7. He also developed the adjacent building on the corner of St Martin's Lane for the Exeter Bank, of which he was one of the founding members, with John Duntze, Joseph Sanders and Daniel Hamilton. It appears that work proceeded quickly on the hotel site because in early September 1766 a newspaper article referred to there having been \\"an Assembly at Mr Berlon's New Room\\" accompanied by \\"some curious Fireworks in the Churchyard\\". In August 1767 there was a newspaper notice of an entertainment to take place at \\"Mr Berlon's new Assembly-Room\\".

In September 1770, Berton placed an advertisement for the business, describing it as \\"New Coffee-house, Inn, and Tavern, Or, The Hotel, In St. Peter's Church-yard, Exeter.\\" This is possibly the first use of the word hotel in England.Marsh (2017), p. 27‚Äì8. According to Alexander Jenkins, writing in 1806, the hotel provided \\"a commodious room for holding public balls, assemblies, concerts, &c.;\\".Jenkins (1806), p. 213. Jenkins further described it as: > a large and commodious Inn, with elegant apartments and accommodation for > people of the first Quality, with a large assembly-room in which are held > the Assize Balls, Concerts and Winter assemblies, of the most distinguished > persons of the City and County. In the front is a neat Coffee-room: the > situation of the Hotel is very pleasant, as it opens to the Parade, and > commands a noble view of the Cathedral.Jenkins (1806), p. 317.

Its architecture features a combination of Beaux-Arts and Romanesque Revival styles. It started life as the home of the Memphis newspaper Evening Scimitar and is currently a boutique hotel. Building The Scimitar Building is a five-story stoned-veneer structure on a raised basement, designed in a combination of Beaux-Arts and Romanesque revival styles. The lobby is lined with original Tennessee marble, and is encircled by large circular, arched windows. Originally the building had entrances on both Third and Madison streets. Lion heads decorate the top of the building along the fifth floor. Although several alterations have been done in 1920s, 1950s, 1970s, and 2010s, the building overall retains a high degree of historical and architectural integrity. History Scimitar Building in 1909 The Scimitar Building was commissioned by Napoleon Hill (1830‚Äì1909) in 1902 and designed by local architects August A. Chigazola (1869-1911) and William J. Hanker (1876‚Äì1958).https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/napoleon-hill/ Hill, known as Memphis' original \\"merchant prince\\", was one of the wealthiest people in Memphis, and a part owner of the Evening Scimitar. Hill lived across Madison Avenue in a mansion which stood on the site of the present Sterick Building. Hill's initials can still be seen etched into the fa√ßade of the building. The Scimitar Building was home to the Memphis newspaper Evening Scimitar (later News-Scimitar and then Press-Scimitar) from 1902 to 1929. The newspaper took up three floors of the building. The raised basement was home to the stereotype and composing rooms of the newspaper, as well as the press machinery. People on the street could view the press machinery in operation through the building's giant windows. In 1926, the newspaper outgrew the building and moved to an address on Union Avenue. The building was the headquarters for Memphis Light, Gas and Water from 1937 to 1970. Later, the building was an office building known as the Winchester Building. The Winchester Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The property went on the market in 2012 and was sold in 2014 for $1.26 million. In 2016 the building re-opened as the Hotel Napoleon with 56 guest rooms, a business center, and fitness center.

one of the largest historical subgroups of the larger Yoruba people of West Africa, located in Nigeria. They are classified as a Central Yoruba group, alongside the Ijesha, Igbomina, Yagba and Ifes. Ekiti State is populated exclusively by Ekiti people; however, it is but a segment of the historic territorial domain of Ekiti-speaking groups, which historically included towns in Ondo State such as Akure (the current capital and largest city of Ondo State), Ilara-Mokin, Ijare, and Igbara-oke. Irun, Ogbagi, Ese and Eriti in the Akoko region, as well as some towns in Kwara State, are also culturally Ekiti, although belong in other states today. The name Ekiti is a derivation of an earlier term, Okiti, which means \\"Hilly\\" in Yoruba, as characterized by the generally hilly terrain of the areas which the Ekiti inhabit. Language and dialect The language commonly spoken by the Ekiti people is a distinct Yoruba dialect also named 'Ekiti'. Despite its comparatively large geographical spread, Ekiti remains relatively uniform within the areas where it is spoken. The dialect generally transients into Ijesha speech towards the west beyond the Effon ridge, and into Igbomina in the north and northwest towards the town of Omu Aran, both of which still fall within the Central Yoruba Continuum. Towards the northeast, away from the town of Ikole and Omuo, the dialect gradually fades into Yagba and Ijumu types respectively. Geography The Ekiti cover an area of 8,557 km¬≤, and are culturally bound by the Igbomina to the north and the Ijeshas to the west (the traditional Ekiti-Ijesha cultural boundary being at Ipetu-Ijesha). The Ondos are located to the southwest, the Owos to the southeast, and the Akokos, Yagbas and Ijumus to the northeast. Ekiti State is generally an upland zone, with elevations being generally above 450m throughout. Around Akure, elevations drop to around 360m. It lies on an area underlain by metamorphic rock, and is generally an undulating country with a characteristic landscape that consists of old plains broken by steep-sided outcrops that may occur singularly or in groups or ridges. Such outcrops can be seen in places at Aramoko, Efon-Alaiye, Ikere-Ekiti, Igbara-odo and Okemesi-Ekiti among others. Rugged hills dot the landscape, notable among which are the Olosunta hills of Ikere-Ekiti in the south, Effon ridge which runs longitudinally around Efon-Alaiye on the western boundary, and Ado Hills in the centre. The topography was perhaps the single strongest reason why the Ekitis never became a single unit politically. The area enjoys a tropical climate with two distinct seasons, these are the rainy season - which lasts from April to October - and the dry season which commences in late November and ends in March. Temperature ranges between 21 ¬∞C and 28 ¬∞C with high humidity. In the South, the vegetation is primarily Tropical hardwood forest, while a mixed/derived type savannah can be observed in the northern peripheries. Local administration and population After 1854, Akure and other Ekiti towns came under the rule of Ibadan and many settlements were destroyed. This lasted until a rebellion in 1876 followed by a prolonged war between the Yoruba states, in which the Ekitis combined forces with the Ijeshas and some Akoko towns as a clan confederation known as the Ekiti Parapo to resist Ibadan rule, led by Chief Fabunmi of Oke-Imesi and Chief Ogedengbe of Ijeshaland. Towards the end of the 19th century, the British, based on their Lagos Colony, had established a protectorate over the area, although they ruled through \\"native\\" administrations. They sought to combine the Ekiti kingdoms of the region into a single administrative unit against resistance by the Ekiti people, who preferred local autonomy. In 1899, Ekiti and Ilesha formed the north-eastern division of the protectorate. In 1915, Ekiti, Owo and Ondo were combined to form the Ondo Province with headquarters at Akure. In looking at the creation of Native Authorities at Oke-Imo, Ilesa in 1900 by Major Reeve Tucker and the re-organization of North East District in December, 1912; the separation of Ijesa, Ekiti and other areas on 1 January 1913, and the creation of Ekiti Native Authority with its headquarters at Ado-Ekiti, conflicts and agitations for local autonomy had pervaded politics of traditional institutions in Ekitiland. When the British moved their administrative centre for Ekiti District to Ado-Ekiti in 1913 where the Ewi holds sway, the change in political status of Ado-Ekiti spurred a desire in other traditional authorities across Ekitiland to further demand for local autonomies. The heightened struggle did not give credibility to the fact that Ado-Ekiti which was eventually picked was already the official and major administrative capital of Ekitiland since 1 January 1913, nor did it occur to the agitators that it had over time become a second home for all Ekiti people irrespective of their hometown or place of origin. Hence, the struggle for relevance and supremacy which continued to rear its head is worth a fuller study and understanding is required if lasting solutions are to be found. In a similar vein, when the British mooted the idea of recognizing a paramount ruler for Ekitiland; as it did in Ijebu and Egbaland where the Awujale and the Alake became paramount rulers; its agents faced resistance from Ekiti Obas who opposed the mode of listing and role of traditional rulers at Oke-Imo meetings. The attempt by the British colonists to impose a sole native authority in Ekitiland in pursuit of their indirect rule policy failed because of the rejection of the supremacy theory among Ekiti Obas. Every attempt to further centralize traditional political authorities under the Ewi of Ado- Ekiti with Ado-Ekiti as the capital of Ekitiland, despite the ingenuity of its experimentation, was also resisted. The creation of colonial territories - which transformed into modern states after the various colonial interests left Africa - resulted in the division of existing traditional communities. Ondo Province later became part of Western State. In 1976, the old Ondo State was formed and in 1996, Ekiti State was split off from the modern Ondo State, which has Akure as its capital. History Yoruba bowl from the Ekiti cultural area Ekiti State was created on 1 October 1996 alongside five other states by the Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, General Sani Abacha, GCON in a nation-wide broadcast to mark the 36th Independence anniversary of Nigeria. The State, carved out of Ondo State, covers the former twelve local government areas that made up the Ekiti Zone of old Ondo State.http://www.ngex.com/nigeria/places/states/ekiti.htm Ekiti as a nation within the Yoruba ethnicity has her progenitor in Oduduwa, as do most of the other major sub-ethnic divisions in Yorubaland. However, unlike the more centralized kingdoms and city-states to the West, the Ekitis traditionally lived in smaller, less politically centralized kingdoms that were largely independent of one another, although they traded amongst themselves and their ruling families often contracted dynastic marriages. The boundary of modern Ekitiland was shifted several times within a spate of 23 years without regard for the existing practice for identifying traditional boundaries in the African traditional society. Some of the major Ekiti settlements affected by the shift in boundaries for political and administrative purposes are as follows: Ekiti settlements transferred to Northern Nigeria in the colonial era. * Otun (Awtun) Kingdom - Otun, Ekan, Aaye Ekan, Iloffa, Eruku, Idofin, Ilale, Erinmope, Ipetu, Orota, Ola. * Obbo (Obo) Kingdom - Osi, Ora Aiyetoro, Ejiu. * Omuo-Ekiti and its neighbors - Omuo, Oyin, Iro, Afin, parts of Egbe oba Kingdom. * Eka Community - Erinmope Ekiti, Aare Opin, Isolo Opin, Isare Opin, Osi, Ikerin Opin, Oke Opin, Epe Opin, Owaatun Opin, Etan, Obbo-Ayegunle, Onno-Ile, Eruku, Ajuba, Isapa, Ejiu and others. Ekiti settlements transferred to the Ondo and Owo regions under colonial Nigeria. * Akure - Akure Kingdom, Iju, Itaogbolu, Igbara Oke, Ijare, Ilara-Mokin, Ibule etc. * Akoko West - Irun, Ogbagi, Ese, Eriti. Ekiti used to exist as sixteen principal kingdoms. Each had a senior Oba superintending over its territory. There was never a centralized single political unit among the Ekiti people. Even though the Oore of Otun Ekiti - a town to the north of the Ekiti cultural area - was considered the most senior of the Ekiti kings from the advent of the British occupation of Ekitiland to the later end of Nigeria's colonial rule, the senior Ekiti Obas of Akure (Deji), Ado (Ewi) and Ikere (Ogoga) presided over the largest towns, and Akure was the Ekiti town with the closest links to Benin. The Atolagbe school The view of a section of Ekiti historians (such as Atolagbe) is that the pre-eminence of the Oore as the most senior Yoruba and Ekiti Oba was linked to the fact that the Oore signed the 1886 peace treaty which the British coordinated with the Alaafin of Oyo and the Owa Obokun of Ijeshaland, among others. The Oba of Benin was also made to enter into a treaty with the Alaafin of Oyo. Under this treaty, Ekiti, Ondo and Edo were considered part of his traditional areas of influence and would be free of Oyo territorial incursions, while the Alaafin of Oyo would have the Western and Northern Yoruba territories, including parts of the non-Yoruba speaking neighbours like the Nupe, Ibariba and Aja in Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin). Samuel Rowe, the Governor of the Gold Coast Colony, documented some useful hints concerning the pre-eminence of the Oore of Otun on May 29, 1883, when he wrote: \\"Ekiti Parapo is a name given to the confederation of \\"Efon tribes\\". There are said to be 132 kings among them. The principal of these kings is one Oray (Oore)\\". Due to a controversy between the Northern Government and the administration of Major Reeves Tucker, the territories of Otun, Obo, Ishan, Aiyede and Ikole were carved out of the South and then merged with the territories of Northern Nigeria. Subsequently, and following the readjustment of the boundary between the Ekiti (Southern) and Kabba (Northern) divisions in 1909, Ishan, Aiyede and Ikole returned to the Ekiti division while Otun, Obo and others remained in the North, under Ilorin division. In the period of the Oore's absence in Ekitiland, the idea of an Ekiti council of Obas died away. There was no meeting of the council held throughout the period due to a lack of acceptable leadership among all the Obas. Leadership naturally fell to the Ewi of Ado, who in fact represented the Ekiti Obas at the conference of Yoruba Obas held at Ibadan in 1939. Following the return of Otun town to the Ekiti Division in 1936, the council of Ekiti Obas was re-introduced in the form of the Pelupelu (whose name was derived from \\"Pe Olu\\" i.e. \\"The calling of Lords\\") and the Oore was again made the president. In the biography of H.R.H. Oba Aladesanmi, an Ewi of Ado Ekiti, the Oba said: \\"I am in the third position in the Ekiti Division Council of Traditional Rulers which has the Ajero of Ijero Ekiti as the second. The senior one, Oore of Otun, had his district transferred to Ilorin Emirate Council. It was later returned to Ekiti division of Ondo province after much agitation from the people to the government\\". The Falegan school Another school of thought contests the supremacy of the Oore as the most senior Oba in Ekiti for several reasons. First is the fact that the Oore did not possess the largest kingdom in the pre-colonial era. The Ewi of Ado-Ekiti and the Deji of Akure had far larger territories. It is argued that the Oore was more of a mercenary king during the Kiriji war, unlike the principal kings who hardly left their palaces even in the face of war. An example of this is the fact that the Ewi remained in Ado, and only left it when his town relocated temporarily due to the Benin horde's invasion. Atolagbe acknowledged that the Oore was not a prince of the Oduduwa dynasty but was rather a friend or benefactor of his. Hence, he was a native personality that was integrated into the Yoruba culture under the dynastic reign of Oduduwa and his successors. As Oduduwa's children and grandchildren included the Ewi, the Ajero, the Alara and the Elekole, all are therefore direct heirs of Oduduwa. Due to this, the Oore could not be of equal rank with them according to Yoruba customary law. He could not have been the most senior Yoruba king in Ekitiland, even if he was an Ekiti native that survived or a follower of Obatala that was conquered. Furthermore, references to the Oore in the Ifa oracle only state that the Oore was also an Ifa follower, whereas the same Ifa section mentions that Ado-Ekiti is the home (or abode) of Ifa, which invariably made the Oore an adherent like any other while the Ewi is a custodian of the Ifa religion. Moreover, the pelupelus which the Oore chaired at the advent of the Kiriji war in Otun had few of the principal Obas in attendance. They did not include the Ewi, the Deji and the Ogoga, to mention a few. The meetings were regarded as being of a lesser importance, except for mobilizing the coalition of warriors and hunters for the Ekiti war of liberation spearheaded by Fabunmi. There are records which state that the pelupelus held before then were often held in Ado-Ekiti under the Ewi, meetings where the Obas never met, because tradition forbade Obas from looking into each other‚Äôs eyes in Yorubaland prior to the arrival of the British. The pelupelu where the Oore was recognized by the British as the most senior Oba was an imposition at Oke-Imo in 1900 by Major Tucker, owing to recognition of his heroic contributions to the Kiriji wars and the signing of its 1886 treaty, the age of the Oore at the time of the meeting, a mistake in the itinerary of Tucker's visit to Ekiti upon which he accorded the Oore a higher status and the role the Oore played as the first Ekiti Oba to accept British colonial rule in Ekitiland. Finally, the story of the Oore where he is mentioned as a co-equal friend of Oduduwa has never been accepted in Ife tradition as being true. According to Babatola, the fact that a school of Yoruba history regarded the Oore as a prince of Ile-Ife, while others referred to him as a follower of Obatala, whom Oduduwa deposed as king upon his arrival at Ife, is enough reason to ask more questions. On the other hand, Falegan insisted that the Oore could not claim any supremacy or superiority that he did not enjoy in Ekitiland prior to colonial rule. He insisted that if the Oore is a son of Oduduwa, his status would depend on where he is ranked on the list of the prominent children of Oduduwa who made spectacular gains in their adventures away from Ile-Ife, particularly those who drifted towards Ekitiland. Otherwise, if the Oore is an Obatala follower who survived as a native entity that Oduduwa met at Ile-Ife and subsequently integrated, he could not promote himself in tradition above the new dynasty of Oduduwa and his sons in Yorubaland. Falegan, therefore, remarked thus: \\"How did the Oore become a king, if he was neither a son of Oduduwa nor his lieutenant?\\" Babatola similarly reviewed the version of the Oore's history presented by Atolagbe and other Moba historians and submitted thus: \\"Atolagbe's reconstruction of Moba history and the place he advocated for Oore in Yoruba and Ekiti history to boost the status of Oore in the eyes of all the world as the most senior Ekiti Oba is a grievous injury to Yoruba history. Indeed, it has an element of profoundly damaging conjuncture of tradition and culture in our history that should be redressed to the extent of its fallacies or distortion. Though the damage done is reversible through the harmonization of different traditions of Ekiti people to expose his delicacies of concoction and false claims, Atolagbe attempted most likely to also score a point against Ekiti Obas who opposed Oore‚Äôs listing ahead of them at Oke-Imo meetings in finding a medium of restoring Oore pre-eminence that was gained at the close of Kiriji and early years of British colonial rule in Ekitiland.\\" Recent events With the creation of the Ekiti Native Authority (Ekiti Division) at Ado-Ekiti in January 1913, and Akure becoming the provincial centre, and correspondingly with its growth in size and status, the pre-eminence of the Oore and the prominence of the Ewi were gradually resolved politically. Kenyo compiled a list of 104 Ekiti autonomous communities existing in the 1950s with names of their traditional rulers who came from Ile-Ife or Benin and other places to Ekitiland, though some are now located outside Ekiti State. Despite the fact that the number of autonomous communities in Ekitiland was 104 in 1955 (with some of these towns eventually transferred to neighboring Ondo, Kogi and Kwara States), the number of autonomous local communities in present Ekiti state in 2014 has increased to 134 due to official interventions and government proclamations. The latent question to ask here is whether the Ekiti Obas and their communities who later got local autonomy were initially affected by British re-organization of Ekiti towns, or they were subjugated under larger kingdoms or communities for a long period of time before they successfully asserted their autonomy. Another possibility is that other issues resulted in their differences, which in turn caused their demands for separation from the time of British colonial rule until now.

Description The play is an attempt by a Chinese- American playwright to describe his conflicted feelings, being raised by \\"tiger parents\\" while confronting the realities of career and lifestyle choices in the United States. It lampoons the stereotypes that surround Chinese-Americans while illustrating the weight of such stereotypes on those involved. As the play opens, an older sister and a younger brother living in the United States are reflecting on the unrealized potential in their lives, as they squabble and consider their individual futures. They finally decide to travel to China, where \\"race will not be a problem\\". Albert is in his early 30s. Jennifer is also in her 30s. They were high achievers in their youth. They both went to Harvard (she graduated in three years). She played piano ‚Äî \\"I was the first MD/PhD ever to sell out a concert at Carnegie Hall,\\" she boasts ‚Äî and he played cello. She became an oncologist; he became a software programmer. But they have ended up with neither the professional fulfillment nor the romantic satisfaction they anticipated. Their life plans are not being fulfilled. Jennifer has just been dumped by her boyfriend, who excused his leaving by explaining that he at first found her exotic, but was disappointed when she was not \\"submissive\\". Albert has just been passed over for a promotion at his company. Looking for explanations for their relative failures, they first blame their parents. They decide it would be therapeutic to confront the parents to demand an apology for the \\"tiger parenting\\" that fostered unrealistic expectations but inadequate life skills. Says Albert, \\"I'm gonna yell at my mom like a white girl!\\" However, Mom and Dad prove unrepentant; they advise the children to stop whining. So Albert and Jennifer decide to travel to China, the ancestral homeland, as part of an \\"Asian Freedom Tour\\" that will allow them to reinvent themselves (\\"If we can‚Äôt escape a racialized context in America despite being Americans, then we go be Chinese in China, where race is no longer a factor\\").

He was ambassador to Portugal from 1714 to 1722 and Governor of Barbados from 1722 to 1731. Early life Worsley was the second son of Sir Robert Worsley, 3rd Baronet, of Appuldurcombe, Isle of Wight and his wife Mary Herbert, daughter of Hon. James Herbert, MP of Kingsey, Buckinghamshire. He was admitted at Lincoln's Inn on 30 April 1690 and matriculated at St. Edmund Hall, Oxford on 14 August 1690. Army career Worsley joined the Army as an ensign in Colonel William Beveridge's Regiment of Foot (later the 14th Regiment of Foot) in 1689, becoming a lieutenant in 1693, and seeing action in Scotland and Flanders, where he was present at the battles of Landen and Namur. He transferred to become a captain in Colonel Francis Fergus O‚ÄôFarrell‚Äôs Foot Regiment (later the 21st Foot) in 1693 and then as a captain-lieutenant in the 1st Foot Guards in 1700, rising in turn to captain and lieutenant-colonel between 1702 and 1708. Political and diplomatic career Worsley was returned unopposed as a Whig Member of Parliament for Newtown, Isle of Wight on the interest of his brother, Sir Robert Worsley, 4th Baronet, at the 1705 English general election. He voted for the Court candidate as Speaker on 25 October 1705. He was not an active Member being a serving officer, but with other members of the family in the House, most of his contributions can not be identified. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 30 November 1705. In 1708 Worsley retired from the Army and, having fought in Spain, was appointed an envoy to the King Charles III of Spain, but in the event was never sent. At the 1708 British general election. he was returned unopposed again as a Whig MP for Newtown. He was listed as a Court Whig and voted for the naturalisation of the Palatines in 1709 and for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. After the 1710 British general election with a Tory Administration, he switched to the Tory side. He became a member of the October Club, and, in 1711, was listed as a ‚Äòworthy patriot‚Äô who detected the mismanagements of the previous Parliament. He was hoping for office from Harley, to whom he gave his collection of manuscripts. In 1711, Worsley went with Earl Rivers to Hanover to explain the proposed peace terms to the court, but declined a permanent post as financially insufficient. He voted for the French commerce bill on 18 June 1713, but was later considered as a Tory who sometimes voted with the Whigs. He was returned again unopposed for Newtown at the 1713 British general election and shortly afterwards was appointed Envoy to Portugal, by the support of Lord Bolingbroke. He arrived at Lisbon in April 1714 and survived in post on the change of administration on the accession of George I. He did not stand at the 1715 British general election and remained in Portugal until 1722. In 1721 he was appointed Governor of Barbados, arriving in 1723 and holding the position until 1731, when he was removed from office after adverse complaints. Worsley died unmarried on 15 March 1740.

The 16-day arts festival will take place from 13 - 28 July this year throughout the city. Inaugurated in 2010, the festival was initially mooted to celebrate the inscription of George Town as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It has since grown into a \\"major Asian arts event\\", attracting about 250,000 visitors in 2015.  History  The 2012 edition featured Ernest Zacharevic's famous wall murals, which were drawn throughout George Town, such as the 'Children on a Bicycle' at Armenian Street. In 2009, George Town World Heritage Incorporated, a state agency tasked with monitoring and promoting the city's heritage, had held a day-long festival to mark the inscription of the historical core of George Town as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the previous year. Encouraged by the success of that event, a longer, month-long festival was mooted in 2010. Joe Sidek, a well known Malaysian artist, was roped in to manage the festival. In spite of budgetary constraints, the inaugural event was successfully held throughout the month of July in 2010. The art festival has been organised yearly since then, with events being held by utilising the city's heritage architecture as performance venues. The 2014 edition drew in 218,355 visitors, a figure which rose to 250,000 in the following year.  Festival program description  The George Town Festival is held to celebrate and preserve the local arts, culture and heritage. Artistic performance, including dance, music and theater, as well as photography and heritage exhibitions, have been included in the festival. Although the month-long art festival is typically headlined by international acts, the majority of the acts are of local origin. In addition, the art festival has become a conduit where regional cultural arts are promoted. For instance, the 2014 edition featured several acts by Singaporean artists highlighting the shared culture between the two fellow Straits Settlements cities, whilst in 2017, the festival was kicked off with an ensemble of musical performances from throughout Southeast Asia. 2019 co- production with OzAsia Festival In October 2019, co-commissioned by OzAsia festival and the George Town Festival, a play was created and staged by Malaysian duo TerryandTheCuz, named Light. It explores the personal circumstances first Francis Light and his pivotal role in Penang's modern history and then of William Light in Adelaide. It shows how their lives were influenced by global politics, in particular the rise of the British Empire.

Muleya broke racial barriers and opened a new era in Rhodesian sport when he beat the famous British four minute miler, Gordon Pirie, by 100 yards in a three-mile race at Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia in December 1958. Biography=Early life Muleya was born in Mudukula Village, in Pemba District which was under Choma District at that time in the then Northern Rhodesia, the fourth surviving son of Jam and Munsanda Siakwambwa.Walubita, Moses (2011). \\"Zambia Sporting Score: A Period of Hits and Misses,\\" Bloomington, IN, iUniverse As his immediate elder brother had died in infancy, Tonga custom called for the next surviving child to be named after anything other than human so he was named Siachobe after a beetle which is associated with rain and means the harbinger of good news. He started school at Mudukula Primary School and was a keen runner from an early age, often racing the village dogs. The village was on hilly terrain and this aided his training with his normal routine being an early morning 16 km run. After completing his primary education, Muleya proceeded to Munali Secondary School in Lusaka and from there, qualified to Hodgson Training School where he enrolled as an apprentice motor vehicle mechanic in early 1958.\\"Mail remembers Muleya,\\" Zambia Mail, 21 Nov 1962 p. 29. Career It was at Hodgson that Muleya's career took off. He surprised many when he set a Northern Rhodesia & Federal record of 14: 57.2 in the 3 mile event on 27 May 1958. On the strength of this achievement, he was invited to compete against British distance star Gordon Pirie in a track meet at Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, a segregationist stronghold on 6 December 1958. However, his skin colour almost saw him being barred by South Africa-born William DuBois, a dedicated white supremacist who served as chairman of the Southern Rhodesian Amateur Athletic and Cycling Union.\\"Sport: Race Against Racism,\\" http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,937731,00.html Time, 22 December 1958 \\"Mister whatever-his-bloody-name-is ‚Äì this 'Kaffir' ‚Äì has never even sent in a formal application. And if he had, it would have been turned down,\\" said DuBois who when reminded of Muleya's record, added scornfully, \\"We do not count Kaffirs' performances.\\" The association overruled DuBois and declared that Muleya would be allowed to compete but not wholeheartedly as he was excluded when white competitors were presented to the Governor before the race. Muleya thus became the first African ever permitted to run in a track meet of the Southern Rhodesian Athletics Association. Running barefoot on the muddy 3 mile course, he kept pace with Pirie and eventually overtook him to win the race by 100 yards and in the process, he set a new Rhodesian record of 14:48.5. Muleya became an instant hero as joyful spectators, black and white alike, bore him from the track in triumph on their shoulders, with one white tobacco farmer stating: \\"He may be black, but, by God, he's a Rhodesian.\\"\\"1st African admitted to Rhodesia meet, wins\\" Jet, Vol. 15 No. 9, 1 Jan 1959, p. 15, Johnson Publishing Company Officials presented Pirie with a plaque to mark his visit and he brusquely handed it over to Muleya. Said Negro Leader Stanlake Samkange: \\"Muleya did more for good race relations in under a quarter of an hour than hundreds of twittering interracialists have achieved in the last five years.\\" DuBois was chastened, saying: \\"It was a great race. The day of multiracial athletics is here, I'm afraid.\\" Muleya's victory was reported in the popular American magazine Sports Illustrated as making \\"a nice crack in Rhodesia's grim racial barrier.\\"\\"Events & Discoveries\\" (1958).

Crash,\\" Jet, 10 December 1959, p. 54. Death On 16 November 1959, Muleya and, white track star, John Winter, the Southern Rhodesian quarter mile champion, set off on 3 month scholarships at the Central Michigan College from Salisbury Airport. They arrived in the United States three days later and were scheduled to take part in their first sports meet on 23 November 1959 at East Lansing. They started off for East Lansing in the morning accompanied by American athlete Leroy Zimmer and a driver. At 8:30 AM with the highway slippery and visibility reduced due to thick fog, their vehicle collided with another car near Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. Muelya, Winter, Zimmer and the driver of the vehicle were seriously injured while the two occupants of the other vehicle died in the crash. Doctors unsuccessfully attempted to save his life and Muleya died that same evening while Winter died five days later. His remains were transported back home and after the church service at Sikalongo mission, he was buried in his home village. He was given a state funeral and his younger brother Jesse represented the family at the open air memorial service which was held at Hodgson Technical College.

On 19 March 2013 J√©r√¥me Cahuzac resigned as a minister in charge of fighting against tax fraud due to tax fraud allegations. He later admitted that he had held a secret foreign bank account for about 20 years. As a consequence, he was officially excluded as a member of the Socialist Party. The release of the Panama Papers confirmed that Cahuzac owned a Seychelles company named Cerman Group Limited, incorporated in 2009, whose director and shareholder were from other offshore companies. J√©r√¥me Cahuzac was sentenced to three years in prison and five years of ineligibility on 8 December 2016.  Background  The global financial crisis of 2008 is considered by many to be the worst financial crisis since 1929's Black Thursday. It left France and the rest of Europe exhausted and indebted. Nicolas Sarkozy, President of France from 2007 to 2012, was in charge at the time. Following his five years of tenure, he was ousted after losing the second round of the 2012 presidential elections against Francois Hollande. French people had grown distrustful and wary of the political scene and its participants, making this affair extremely timely. J√©r√¥me Cahuzac is a physician whose political career began in 1997 when he was elected to be a deputy of the National Assembly. The National Assembly is one of the two major political bodies in France. Currently 577 deputies make up the National Assembly. Along with the Senate, it forms the parliament of the Fifth French Republic. Going from general counsel of the Department of \\"Lot- et-Garonne\\" to mayor, and back to deputy, Mr. Cahuzac made a solid name and reputation for himself. In 2010, he was elected President of the Finance, General Economy and Budgetary Control Committees of the National Assembly. Two years later, in 2012, he joined Fran√ßois Hollande's presidential campaign team. He was given the task to handle the budgetary, financial and fiscal aspects of the campaign. After Mr. Hollande's success and election as France's President, Cahuzac was appointed Delegated Minister of Budget on the 16th of May, 2012.  The breakdown of the key moments in the Cahuzac affair  This affair will be broken-down into three main parts: the beginning of the affair, the downfall of its participants, and the reason for the affair's unveiling. This affair originally came out with the publishing of a \\"secret recording\\" by Mediapart. This informational website was launched in 2008 by an editorial team of 35 influential journalists. The recording originally took place towards the end of the year 2000, but was only revealed in the beginning of March 2013. It contained the voices of two individuals, Cahuzac and his wealth manager Herv√© Dreyfus. Both were discussing a variety of financial and private matters. Among these matters, was that of his bank account with UBS. Mr. Cahuzac explained to his associate that his account with that bank was bothering him because he had no more use for it. It was later found that he had transferred all the funds present on that bank account to another one overseas. Here is a short part of the (French) scripted recording that accurately depicts the previously referred to situation: \\"Ca me fait chier d‚Äôavoir un compte ouvert l√†-bas, l‚ÄôUBS c‚Äôest quand m√™me pas forc√©ment la plus planqu√©e des banques.\\" In English, this translates to: \\"The fact of having a bank account open there truly bothers me, UBS isn‚Äôt necessarily the most hidden of banks.\\" Cahuzac never categorically denied the authenticity of the recording. He is known to have said that out of all these minutes of conversation, there may have been a few seconds where it was indeed him speaking. Following the amount of press coverage, proof and criticism stemming from the recording's leakage, President Hollande had no other choice but to release him from his duties as Minister of Budget on the 19th of March, 2013. Mr. Cahuzac was accused of money laundering and fiscal fraud, two crimes that inevitably go hand-in-hand. He later admitted to having transferred 600,000 euros to a bank account in Singapore. Subsequently, he was condemned to three years in prison along with a 375,000 euro fine. The judges on the case deemed this sentence necessary because of the \\"traitorous\\" nature of his acts and words ‚Äì \\"especially when put in contrast with his job responsibilities and requirements\\" said one of the judges. He can however decide to appeal the decision reached by the Justice officials. Conjointly, his ex-wife Patricia Cahuzac is standing trial next to him for \\"family fiscal fraud.\\" Having, in addition to the things previously stated, participated in the creation of various shell companies, she was consequently condemned to two years of prison. The reasons for the unraveling of this affair are numerous. The main reason stems from reporters, who saw huge potential in possible findings resulting from the thorough investigation of the bank accounts of France's newly appointed Minister of Budget ‚Äì who just so happened to previously be a plastic surgeon. Mr. Cahuzac was at the centre of the stage for quite some time. Two other players that had a crucial role in the developing of this affair were the French military along with the armament industry. Mr. Cahuzac was planning on implementing huge budget cuts for the country's Defense budget. Reports indicate that he was planning on bringing it down from 32 to 20 billion euros annually. By doing so, he would encourage the removal of dozens of ground military-units, the cancellation of on-going military contracts for aircraft and helicopters, as well as the rumored removal of France's one and only aircraft carrier, the \\"Charles de Gaulle.\\" In an article published by Atlantico, it is explained that the French secret services, along with multiple members of the Defense Committee, were in fact the key players in this story. It was revealed that they had worked together to gather information on his Swiss UBS bank account and tracked the money-trail that led to Singapore. Once it was done, they leaked their discoveries to the press and just waited for the whole affair to \\"blow-up.\\"  Political impacts and reforms  Following the revelation of the previously discussed information, a multitude of impacts and reforms took place. This story primarily impacted and weakened President Hollande's stature, as he was credited for appointing Cahuzac in the beginning of his tenure. As a consequence of the movement that followed the Minister's resignation, a huge amount of skepticism and distrust settled in the country. Citizens and reporters started questioning and interrogating various politicians ‚Äì thinking that some of them were also undoubtedly involved in the same sort of activities. Political figures such as Pierre Moscovici (Minister of Finance and Economy from 2012 to 2014) and Jean- Jacques Augier (active politician and inspector of finances) were put under investigation as a result. France's President and government subsequently decided to implement new reforms. There were two main reforms announced by President Hollande following this incident. The first one encompasses the idea that elected politicians who have been condemned for fiscal fraud or corruption would be forbidden from any type of public office or mandate. And the second one states that the financial details of each and every single minister and Member of Parliament have to be examined and published. French laws do not sanction the lie of an elected politician in front of the National Assembly. However, to fight perjury as much as possible, a specific law is trying to be put forth and passed by the National Assembly. This law states that a 75,000 euro fine and up to five years of prison was required for any elected politician or Member of Parliament who lies in front of Parliament about a fiscal or criminal matter. These laws and new regulations were put in place after French politicians realized how dissatisfied the French population was. \\"LeMonde,\\" \\"LeFigaro,\\" and \\"LCI,\\" three famous and reliable French news companies, conducted a study that indeed confirmed the preceding statement: 33% of France's citizens wanted President Hollande to dissolve the National Assembly ‚Äì one of the Fifth French Republic's most important and emblematic pillars.  In a nutshell...  Cahuzac was a well-known and respected surgeon and politician. His position as Delegated Minister of Budget attracted a lot of unwanted attention. This unwanted attention ultimately resulted in his resignation and trial for fiscal fraud and money laundering, after the discovery of irrefutable evidence (recordings, bank statements, etc....). His public opinions and political opponents were responsible for the documentation and contribution of key pieces of information to the affair as a whole. As a consequence of such scandals, new laws were introduced to fight fiscal fraud, money laundering and perjury in France's parliamentary systems. In 2013, the year following the divulging of Cahuzac's foreign bank accounts, \\"LeMonde\\" and \\"LeFigaro-LCI\\" published a study that accurately depicted the current public opinion. Within its findings, the research indicated that 77% of French citizens deemed their country's politicians \\"rather corrupt.\\"  Sources and references  *Affaire Cahuzac: L'audition tr√®s attendue de Pierre Moscovici.\\" (2013).

Description Psytalla horrida can reach a body length of .Arthropodus - Fiche d‚Äô√©levage des punaises assassines des genres Platymeris et Psytalla (R√©duves africaines, Reduviidae) It is the largest species of assassin bug in the world. These large and sturdy build insects are characterized by an elongated head, a relatively narrow neck and a rigid, prominent, segmented, tubular mouthparts or proboscis (also called rostrum). Antennae are long and thin. The basic color of the body is black. They show a very prominent crown of thorns on thorax and red and black warning colors on the edge of the abdomen (laterotergites). On the hemelytra are present a few red markings. Legs are rather long, with red and black femurs and completely red tibiae. This species presents an evident sexual dimorphism. In fact the underside of the female's abdomen is completely smooth, while the males at the end of the abdomen have a round outgrowth. Biology and behavior Females lay their eggs in the substrate a few weeks after mating. The incubation may last four to six weeks. The young insects at birth measure about five millimeters. They have a red thorax and abdomen and yellow legs. The chest turns black within a few days. The growth lasts between six and eight months and the young will make six moults to reach the adult stage. Adults live on average one to two years. These terrestrial ambush predators live hidden in timber or dead trees during the day, coming out at night to feed on their prey, that they kill with the venom injected by their rigid rostrum. They can also spray a noxious fluid.

Political theologians try to balance the demands of a tumultuous region with the delicate but long history of Christianity in the Middle East. This has yielded a diversity of political theology disproportionate to the small size of Middle Eastern Christian minorities. The region's importance to Christians worldwide ‚Äì both for history and doctrinal authority for many denominations ‚Äì also shapes the political theologies of the Middle East.  Background  For many Christian leaders, the dominant approach to political theology is one of survival. Many Arab Christians see themselves as the heirs of a rich Christian heritage whose existence is threatened by regional unrest and religious persecution. Their chief political goal is survival, which sets their political theology apart. At times, Arab Christian leaders have appealed to Christians outside the region through both denominational challenges and broader calls to Christian unity for humanitarian or political aid. In other cases, Christian politicians downplay their faith in the public sphere to avoid conflict with their Muslim neighbours. In the mid-20th century, many Christians in the Middle East saw secular politics as a way out of their traditional status as a minority community in the Islamic world. Christians played prominent roles throughout the pan-Arab nationalist movement in the mid-20th century, where their experience with Western politics and generally high educational attainments made their contributions valuable to nationalist governments around the region. One prominent example was Michel Aflaq, an Eastern Orthodox Christian, who formed the first Ba‚Äôath group from students in Damascus in the 1940s. His belief was that Christians should embrace Islam as part of their cultural identity because nationalism was the best way for Christians to be successful in the Middle East.  Approaches to political theology  With the shift from pan-Arab nationalist movements into Islam-oriented politics, Christians have changed their approach. They have also lost influence because their numbers have declined due to birthrate, emigration, and sometimes overt persecution. Some Christians seek to emphasize the historic Christian presence as a sign of their commitment to the homeland. This ties the Christian minority to the national identity. These Christians often point to the presence of shrines and holy sites nearby to justify the importance of remaining in the Middle East. They emphasize their homeland as the birthplace of Christianity, even at the sacrifice of some religious duties such as evangelical work, as conversion from Islam is illegal in most Middle Eastern countries. Other Christians who live in nations with governments less friendly to them emphasize their ties as Christians with political power in Europe and the United States. They sometimes call on these ties through the corresponding religious leaders in Western nations in the hope that foreign governments will aid their causes from the outside.  Israel/Palestine  Palestinian Christians make up two per cent of the population in Israel and the West Bank/Gaza, and Christians generally emphasize their Palestinian identity over their religious identity in political affairs. Their generally high educational attainments made them key leaders causes for Palestinian nationalism, where they emphasized their historic ties to the Holy Land and religious bonds with Muslims and Jews, but the rise of Islamist groups, and their own declining numbers, has changed the Christian approach to one of influence rather than direct wielding of power. = Palestinian liberation theology = Palestinian liberation theology was developed during the first Palestinian Intifada in the 1980s. It was an effort to reconcile the Christian duties of love and forgiveness, as well as the role of the Bible in Christian and Jewish Zionism, with the struggles of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. Like liberation theology of Latin America, it emphasizes justice for Palestinians while insisting on the need for Christian love. = Key figures = * Naim Ateek, an Anglican priest whose family settled in Jerusalem after expulsion from the Galilee, founded Palestinian Liberation Theology and published a book in 1989 called Justice and Only Justice: A Palestinian Theology of Liberation. * Elias Chacour, a former archbishop in the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, has worked to create a liberation theology that emphasizes love and support for both Jews and Palestinians. He has used educational activism and non-violent political protest to call for Palestinian equality in Israel. * Mitri Raheb, an Evangelical Lutheran priest in Bethlehem, writes that the people of the Holy Land have lived under an occupying power since the time of Jesus. His writings use the Bible to establish a place for Palestinians in the Christian narrative.  Jordan  Christians in Jordan are either descendants of the native Bedouin tribes or of Palestinian refugees, and they point to their historic presence in the area, which predates Islam, as a way of proving their loyalty to Jordan's sympathetic monarchy. Christian politicians formed a surprising political alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood during the 2016 campaign season. Christians justify this by pointing to the need to maintain their historic presence for family and religious reasons, given their proximity to many holy sites.  Key documents  Christian leaders in the Middle East garner support from fellow Christians in other nations, sometimes by issuing direct calls to act on the demands made by their political theology.  Kairos Palestine document  The Kairos document is a call from Palestinian Christian leaders for peaceful co-existence in the Holy Land, beginning with a re-negotiation of rights in Jerusalem for \\"two peoples\\" and \\"three religions\\". The document's theology begins with an insistence on God's love for all people and for Christian love for others, which sometimes requires strong action. The Kairos document argues against theologians who use the Bible to justify a religious state in the Holy Land, where Palestinian Christians and Muslims have a \\"natural right\\" to live. The authors place their hope for peace in God rather than political action, saying \\"resistance with love\\" is \\"a right and a duty for the Christian\\". The document references the Apostle Paul's statement to not resist evil with evil, but it stops short of condemning terrorism, calling instead for a removal of the \\"roots of 'terrorism'\\".  From the Nile to the Euphrates  The Christian Academic Forum for Citizenship in the Arab World released the region's first \\"public theology\\" in 2014, titled From the Nile to the Euphrates: The Call of Faith and Citizenship. The document's authors are scholars from Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, and Iraq, and it critically analyzes the role of religion in helping with the region's educational, social, and structurally political problems. The document stresses religion's potential for harm in political life multiple times and repeatedly emphasizes the need for Christians and Muslims to work together using principles of equality and freedom.

After his retirement from the Army, Lincoln served as general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority from 1965 to 1967. Early life Lincoln was born in Fort Thomas, Kentucky on December 2, 1910. His father, Rush B. Lincoln Sr. was a major general in the United States Army. His grandfather was general James Rush Lincoln. His sister, J. Virginia Lincoln, was an physicist. Lincoln later lived in Washington D.C., where he graduated from Western High School and Schad's School. United States Army=Early years In 1932, Lincoln graduated at the top of his class at the United States Military Academy. He was appointed as a second lieutenant on June 10, 1932. He was promoted to first lieutenant on September 22, 1935 and by 1942 was a lieutenant colonel. World War II Lincoln was promoted to colonel on September 13, 1944. During World War II, Lincoln took part in the seven conferences between the heads of state and the combined chiefs of staff (Washington, the first and Second Quebec Conferences, Cairo, Tehran, Malta, and Yalta). He was also a member of the Joint Staff Planning and the Army Forces Western Pacific, headquartered in Manila. During the final months of the war, Lincoln served as the chief of transportation in the Pacific Theatre. Post-war Lincoln remained in Manila for a year after the war and then attended the Armed Forces Staff College, where he was a member of the school's first class. He was then assigned as the Assistant Commandant of the Transportation School. In 1950 he graduated from the National War College and was assigned as a special assistant to General Frank A. Heilman, the Army's Chief of Transportation. In April 1951, Lincoln was assigned to the newly formed Logistics Division at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe. The Logistics Division's mission was to develop facilities to enhance the military readiness of NATO countries as well as coordinate and develop plans to increase emergency preparedness. On October 2, 1954 he was promoted to Brigadier general in that December he was assigned as the commanding general of Fort Eustis. On July 6, 1956 he was promoted to major general. In August 1958 he became the Deputy Chief of Transportation, HQDA. He was promoted to Chief in March 1962 and in July 1963 was named the commanding general of the Defense Traffic Management Service. Decorations and badges Lincoln was awarded the Legion of Merit with two Oak leaf clusters and the Distinguished Service Medal. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority In 1965, Lincoln turned down a promotion to Lieutenant general to become the general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). He retired from the Army on January 31, 1965 and took over at the MBTA the following day. His appointment was championed by General James McCormack, the chairman of the MBTA board of directors and a former West Point classmate of Lincoln's. During his tenure with the MBTA, Lincoln had difficulties with officials under him, who were appointed based on political affiliations and did not hold allegiance to Lincoln. He was publicly critical of deputy general managers Edward F. McLaughlin Jr. and Michael J. Powell, who he felt undercut his authority by dealing directly with the board of directors. By 1967, the MBTA's deficit had grown to over $32 million annually and Lincoln came under pressure to resign. Lincoln resigned in September 1967, citing a \\"lack of understanding on the part of some people as how the affairs of the authority should be conducted and a lack of appreciation of the time it takes to plan and do a job so that it is done right the first time.\\" Later life and death Lincoln resided in Wellesley, Massachusetts following his retirement from the Army and remained there until his death on August 15, 2002.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. It is the only building in Detroit designed by noted Palm Beach, Florida architect John L. Volk. The property is currently owned by Halcor Studio Live LLC. History WJBK began as an AM radio station (now WLQV) in Detroit. In 1947 the station's television license was awarded by the Federal Communications Commission to George B. Storer's Fort Industry Broadcasting, the forerunner to Storer Communications. WJBK-TV began broadcasting on Channel 2 in Detroit on October 24, 1948 as a CBS affiliate. It was the third television station to go on the air in Detroit. The station began broadcasting from the Detroit Masonic Temple, but in 1956 Storer commissioned John L. Volk to design this studio. Storer and Volk were friends, and Storer had already commissioned a long string of works from Volk. The building was constructed that year, and WJBK moved its operations here. Multiple shows were produced by Storer in the building, including its newscast, Sagebush Shorty, and Sir Graves Ghastly. However, by 1971, WJBK had outgrown the studio and operations were moved to a newer building on Nine Mile Road in Southfield. The Detroit building was sold to Detroit's public television station WTVS, Channel 56, for $750,000. WTVS used it until 2009, when they sold it to Mosaic Youth Theatre of Detroit. Mosaic used the building until 2014, when it was sold to a developer. Description The former WJBK- TV Studios Building is a two-story red brick Georgian Revival structure with limestone trim and brick quoins. The front facade has a projecting central section with a limestone-trimmed entry portico with flanked by Ionic columns. Equally spaced aluminum six-over-six double-hung windows run on either side of the entrance, and above on the second floor. Atop that is a tall frieze, classical cornice, and a limestone trimmed pediment with an oval window in the center. The interior of the building is divided into two sections: the office/administrative portion and the studio portion. The office portion contains a long rectangular entrance lobby and waiting room paneled with cypress wood, and a large two story open staircase, with curbed transition between rungs, in the center. The studio portion holds two studio spaces and a control room. The studio space was intended to be divided up, holding different sets in the studio at one time as needed.

Background  Iturbide, after declaring the independence of Mexico, entered Mexico City on September 27, 1821 and a few days later Santa Anna entered Veracruz. Iturbide named him Commander of the province of Veracruz, during which time he was in favor of the Empire. But he changed his mind when Iturbide dissolved the Constituent Congress and tried to remove him from his post.  Proclamation  On December 2, 1822, Santa Anna ruled against the empire of Iturbide and the republic for supporting Guadalupe Victoria. Santa Anna promised to follow the principles of the Plan of Iguala, addressed to the population with the following arguments: * He said that when the country had emancipated seeking independence had sought equality, justice and reason. * Mexico had a representative government elected by a Congress that had been dissolved by Iturbide. * The aim of his proclamation was to restore a representative assembly of the nation. * the principles of the Plan of Iguala would be respected and defendant against whom atentase nation against its principles would be considered. An armistice is signed with the royalist forces remaining in the castle of San Juan de Ulua. * freedom of maritime rotation with the peninsula would be restored. The original plan was expanded and was made up of twenty-six clauses. It was ratified on December 6. In the new document it noted that a congress would meet to decide a form of government to continue the principles of religion, independence, and unity. With this plan, Santa Anna lost battles at the beginning of the uprising, but with the proclamation of the Plan de Casa Mata and support of other rebel leaders defeat the forces of Iturbide was encouraged.

The initial goal was simply to remove unpopular ministers from the cabinet of President Anastasio Bustamante. Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, spokesman for the protesters, led an armed uprising five days later. Although the plan and uprising were initially opposed by most of the garrisons and state legislatures, the political and military forces gradually joined the fight against Bustamante's conservative regime which was toppled towards the end of the year.  Historical context  Upon the achievement of independence in 1821, Mexican politics, had been largely divided between those seeking a federal government, and those seeking a more centralist government. The Constitution of 1824 arranged the national government upon federal lines, while the debate over federalism and centralism continued. President Bustamante himself had gained power in a military coup in 1830 against his immediate predecessor Vicente Guerrero, who, in turn, had gained power in a coup against president-elect Gomez Pedraza in 1828. Once in power, the Bustamante administration began to pursue conservative, autocratic, and centralist policies orchestrated primarily by Minister of Interior and Exterior Relations Lucas Alaman. The legislative and the judiciary showed themselves to be subservient to the executive. War Minister Jose Antonio Facio administered an unpopular military rule. Offended by the manner that the military was ruling over their state capital, the legislature of Jalisco moved itself temporarily from Guadalajara to Lagos.  Declaration  Officers of the Veracruz garrison and the San Juan de Ulua fortress complex gathered at the home of Colonel Pedro Landero, where they agreed to the following: #The garrison expresses support for the Federal Constitution of 1824, against the centralist government of Bustamante. #It is requested that the federal cabinet be dismissed due to autocratic abuses. #General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna is invited to command the Veracruz Garrison. #In the event of Santa Anna's acceptance, all power of negotiating with the federal government is handed over to him. Santa Anna, accepted the requests and began communications with Bustamante. He proposed, more liberal cabinet members. The press severely criticized Santa Anna, comparing him to the Roman politician Catiline. Bustamante negotiated with Santa Anna, buying time to delay a civil war while ordering Facio to move a contingent of 4,000 men to Xalapa to halt the rebel advance.Gonz√°lez Pedrero, 2004; 248 On February 24, the rebels seized a convoy with ammunition, money and supplies near the National Bridge. They were defeated on March 3 by the forces of general Jose Maria Calderon and Jose Antonio Facio. Santa Anna escaped to Veracruz' Fort San Juan de Ulua; his strategy worked until mid-May, when Calderon lifted the siege of Veracruz because his army was decimated by rain, heat, mosquitoes and disease.Gonz√°lez Pedrero, 2004; 264-265  Reaction and aftermath  Although the plan was initially opposed by the garrisons of Toluca, Tejupilco, Puebla, Guanajuato, Quer√©taro, Michoac√°n, Tlaxcala, Jalisco, Acapulco, Oaxaca and Aguascalientes, the garrisons' support gradually grew. On March 10, the garrison of Pueblo Viejo supported the plan and imprisoned commander Ignacio Mora. On the 19th, General Jose Esteban Moctezuma (who had been sent to pacify Tamaulipas) joined the plan. General Manuel Mier y Teran and San Luis Potos√≠ governor Zenon Fernandez began preparing troops to face Moctezuma after engaging in dialogue with the rebels.Olavarr√≠a y Ferrari, 1880; 293 The state governments of Zacatecas and Jalisco decided to join the Plan of Veracruz, with the options to summon Manuel G√≥mez Pedraza for the presidency and reverse unconstitutional acts. Farias and Garcia Salinas convinced General Ignacio Inclan to act in Lerma, but his movement was suppressed by Mariano Arista. On May 17, the ministers (except for Finance Minister Mangino) resigned; the press and public opinion felt that this was a political maneuver, since it was believed that former ministers could continue to exercise their duties.Gonz√°lez Pedrero, 2004; 265 General Mariano Martinez de Lejarza took up arms in Tabasco in support of the plan in June, commanding the state capital and repelling an attack by the bustamantista governors of Yucat√°n and Chiapas. On June 12, shortly before a confrontation between Santa Anna and Calderon's forces, a cease-fire was brokered in Corral Falso by Juan Francisco Bautista Caraza. Government forces returned to Encero and rebel forces to Paso de Ovejas, with the National Bridge neutral territory. The government appointed Sebastian Camacho and Guadalupe Victoria as mediators. Manuel Mier y Teran faced Texas settlers who supported the Plan of Veracruz and tried to extend the armistice with Esteban Moctezuma, but the latter refused. Mier y Teran, considered a strong candidate for the presidency, committed suicide on July 3. Six days later, Colonel Antonio Barragan joined the uprising in Valle del Maiz. With negotiations at the National Bridge at an impasse, Moctezuma defeated government forces at Carmelos Well in San Luis Potos√≠ (where General Pedro Otero died). Governor Zenon Fernandez was forced to flee to Quer√©taro.Olavarr√≠a y Ferrari, 1880; 296 On August 6, Bustamante asked Congress for command of the army to confront the rebellion. The following day, Melchor Muzquiz was named interim president and formally took office on August 14. A few days later, the state of Guanajuato was declared neutral. Manuel Prieto in Morelia joined the Plan; Sebastian Camacho distanced himself from Santa Anna, declaring his loyalty to the Bustamante government. The first company of Chihuahua and the colony of Austin in Texas supported the rebellion. On August 12, General Juan Alvarez supported the plan at Fort San Diego in Acapulco.Gonz√°lez Pedrero, 2004; 279 In the Tulancingo and Zacatl√°n area, General Gabriel Valencia deserted Bustamante and joined the rebellion. On September 8, commander Cirilo Gomez Anaya left the capital to fight him. On September 10, Nicolas Bravo forged an armistice with Juan Alvarez on September 10, six days later the governments of Yucat√°n, Campeche and Tabasco delivered Zacatecas to the plan. Bustamante defeated Moctezuma in the September 18 Battle of the Roost, inflicting a total of 2,800 casualties (dead, wounded and prisoners). He sent a letter of resignation to the Chamber of Deputies the following day to end the war, and later went to San Luis Potos√≠.Olavarr√≠a y Ferrari, 1880; 299 Santa Anna defeated Jose Antonio Facio in the September 29 Battle of San Agustin del Palmar and seized weapons and ammunition. A few days later he defeated Juan Jos√© Andrade, who had tried to stop the entry of rebel forces into the capital. After Andrade's surrender, interim president Melchor Muzquiz held talks with Santa Anna to avoid war in Mexico's capital. On November 7, Gomez Pedraza arrived at the port of Veracruz to mediate. After a few skirmishes, Bustamante and Santa Anna signed an armistice on December 11 as the civil war in the rest of the country was concluding. The December 24 Zavaleta Convention established that Gomez Pedraza would be recognized as president and until April 1, 1833.Gonz√°lez Pedrero, 2004; 314  References  Bibliography   * *  External links  * Category:1832 documents Category:1832 in Mexico Category:1832 in politics Category:January 1832 events Category:Plans in Mexico ","title":"Plan of Veracruz (1832)"},{"id":"52124670","text":"BroadTV is a direct broadcast satellite television provider in Nepal.

He completed his training at Oxford, in Paris and in Louvain, where he graduated in Philosophy in 1968. A lawyer with the Council of State since 1966, he soon began to collaborate with the press -Diario Ya, Diario Madrid, Informaciones-, spreading his ideas about what the transition to the death of Francisco Franco should be.

First he is destitute, then rises to affluence, and finally hits the bottom again. Cursing the anonymous witness to his tribulations, he imagines himself as a hapless warrior who loses everything in his strife against the unfathomable, evil forces. \\"I am armless now,\\" he exclaims, before the candle (a symbol of life) dies and darkness falls.The Life of Man.

Critical response The original critical response to the play was mixed, even if the Moscow Art Theatre production was met with unanimous acclaim. Especially harsh were the modernist critics who chose to pan it for its allegedly 'reactionary' politics. Avrely in Vesy called the play \\"the unique, in its own right, collection of banalities.\\" Dmitry Filosofov (in the May 1907 issue of Tovarishch) labeled it \\"the most reactionary piece of work in the Russian literature to date.\\" Zinaida Gippius (writing under the moniker Anton Krainy) attacked the author personally, describing him as 'uncultured', 'poorly educated' , 'pretentious' and thus unequal to the task he'd burdened himself with. Critics differed in their interpretations of the play's ideas and symbolism. According to Maximilian Voloshin's 1907 review, Someone in Grey should be seen as an amalgam of the world's forces of evil, including the power of the state.–ú. –í–æ–ª–æ—à–∏–Ω. –ù–µ–∫—Ç–æ –≤ —Å–µ—Ä–æ–º.

Unlike his friend Maxim Gorky who, while praising his rebellious, anti-establishment attitude, still considered Andreyev's outlook be utterly pessimistic, the author himself insisted that his play was life-affirming. \\"Everybody tells me I am a pessimist.

The best of them is, still, The Life of Man; at least the other-worldliness of these howling, spectral characters creates a certain atmosphere. Its success was to some extent justified but to re-read it now is unbearable.

They have been reported to colonize endophytic tissues of hybrid spruce (Picea glauca x engelmannii) and lodgepole pine with a strong potential to perform biological nitrogen fixation and plant growth promotion. Unlike Burkholderia species, Paraburkholderia members are not commonly associated with human infection. Paraburkholderia members form a monophyletic clade within the Burkholderiaceae family, which is what prompted their distinction as a genus independent from Burkholderia species, in combination with the finding of robust conserved signature indels which are unique to Paraburkholderia species, and are lacking in members of the genus Burkholderia. These CSIs distinguish the genus from all other bacteria. Additionally, the CSIs that were found to be shared by Burkholderia species are absent in Paraburkholderia, providing evidence of separate lineages. Conserved signature indels have also been found within the genus Paraburkholderia. These CSIs are in parallel with phylogenomic analyses that indicate to two monophyletic clades within the genus; one clade harbours unnamed and Candidatus Paraburkholderia, while the other clade is inclusive of environmental Paraburkholderia, commonly used for agricultural purposes. CSIs have been found exclusive to each of these clades, and have not been found specific for any other combination of Paraburkholderia species, providing an additional level of phylogenetic resolution within the genus level.

In its first season Theatre Projects presented the Manitoba premiere of Michel Tremblay's Albertine in Five Times and plays by two local playwrights, David Demchuck and Ellen Peterson. The next season included the homegrown work of Michael Nathanson, who would go on to garner a Governor General's Award nomination for his play Talk and become the artistic director of Winnipeg Jewish Theatre, followed by Vern Thiessen, now a Governor General's Award winner and the artistic director of Workshop West in Edmonton, and Yvette Nolan, who went on to head Canada's leading aboriginal company, Native Earth Performing Arts, in Toronto from 2003 to 2011.

It is located at 1702 Chicago Avenue. On November 9, 2006, the clubhouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places.  Origins = Social club  The organization currently located at 1702 Chicago Avenue was founded on March 2, 1889 at the Judson Avenue home of Women's Suffrage movement leader Elizabeth Boynton Harbert. Originally an informal group, the club drafted an official constitution the following year, stating their purpose as: \\"To secure better homes, wiser motherhood, better laws, truer citizenship and a nobler womanhood by promoting the physical, social, mental, moral and spiritual development of its members.\\" Three years later, this statement was revised and condensed to \\"Mutual helpfulness in all affairs of life, and united effort toward the higher development of humanity.\\"  Current building  In February, 1910, under the supervision of Mrs. Avis Grant, a building committee was organized to oversee the construction of a new clubhouse, and in January, 1911, a lot at the corner of Church Street and Chicago Avenue was purchased. Architect Ernest A. Mayo was commissioned to create the building. Ground was broken that February and the cornerstone was laid on May 28, 1912. The completed building was unveiled in an open gala reception on March 11, 1913. To date it serves as the headquarters of the Woman's Club of Evanston.  Architecture  The Woman's Club building is in the late 19th/early 20th century Revival style. Both the foundation and the walls are made of brick, while the roof is slate. Exterior window trim is white, and the Club features large glass windows on one side.  History  From the beginning, the club has worked locally and around the Chicago metropolitan area to create change in causes such as Woman's Suffrage, child labor laws, public health, sanitation, and home management. By the turn of the century, the Club was organizing awareness and fundraising galas that were notable Evanston cultural and social events. The club's first major project was to establish a hospital in Evanston. A series of epidemics including typhoid fever and smallpox in the 1880s and 1890s prompted the raising of $3,600 towards the creation of the Evanston Hospital. Since its founding, the Woman's Club of Evanston has promoted the advancement of public health. It helped organize the Visiting Nurse Association in 1897 and paid the salary of the first visiting nurse. During World War I, the club entertained servicemen, sponsored Red Cross knitting and sewing groups and provided an ambulance for the Red Cross in France. After the war, their food conservation efforts were converted into support for the opening of a community kitchen. Since its inception, the Woman's Club of Evanston has been involved in promoting culture and the arts, including the 1922 creation of an annual art exhibition in the Clubhouse for community artists. For its 1989 centennial, the Woman's Club was recognized and honored in a program put on by Evanston Hospital, the Visiting Nurses Association, Girl Scouts of the USA, and Boy Scouts of America. On November 9, 2006, the club's headquarters was added to the National Register of Historic Places.  The club today  The club currently has over 350 members, and is active in volunteer work, community mobilization, and social bonding. In addition to its role as the meeting point for the club, the Clubhouse is a prominent location for events such as weddings, fundraisers, parties, Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, and community gatherings. Today, their mission statement is phrased as: \\"Connecting women behind a shared purpose of volunteerism, social empowerment and community support.\\"  References  Category:1913 establishments in Illinois Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1913 Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Cook County, Illinois Category:Buildings and structures in Evanston, Illinois Category:Clubhouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Illinois ","title":"Woman's Club of Evanston"},{"id":"52125038","text":"Bangladesh Press Council is an quasi-judicial institution that protects freedom of speech and regulates the press in Bangladesh and is located in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

It was written, directed by, and stars Luke H. Walker. The story takes place at the wake of its protagonist Dick Johnson, who returns from death to bitterly ruminate about the afterlife, which according to Johnson is a bleak and endless loop of all the world's agonies. The feature film was adapted for screen from the 2016 off-broadway play‚Äì‚Äìalso written by, directed and starring Walker‚Äì‚Äìand produced under the same title.  Plot  Shortly after his death, Dick Johnson returns from the afterlife to rant about drinking, women, and the evils of mankind responsible for the eternal torment his new existence. According to Johnson, death is an alternate universe where the evils of terrestrial life throughout all history abrade the walls of space-time, leaving behind trillions of minuscule punctures and abrasions in the same way sound is recorded on a vinyl record. In death, Johnson is tormented by the ethereal visage of his long deceased uncle Willy, who habitually tortured and raped Johnson in his youth. Johnson describes this astral plane as one where only the most heinous evils throughout all time are collected and merge as one; for Johnson it is a tailored version of hell where he and his uncle Willy are inescapably intertwined for all eternity.  Play  The play first premiered in June 2016 in the basement of Maggie Mae's Pub in Queens, NY. In spring 2019, Walker produced a second full-length run of the play in a small cabin in his back yard at his home in Charlotte, NC, where he moved shortly after the play's initial premiere. It was there the play began to receive attention and received its first critical review by Charlotte based publication, QC Nerve. The publication described the play as \\"[a] comic, eloquent and upsetting rumination on a meaningless universe where even death will not relieve the pain of living.\\" and cited Walker's \\"distinctive voice\\" as \\"poetic, profane and dark as a starless night.\\" In October, 2019 The Wake of Dick Johnson returned to New York at Performance Space 122, this time Walker incorporated a live score composed by Ashville, NC based musical duo Okapi (Lindsey Miller, Scott Gorski). There, the play received yet another laudatory review by Broadwayworld.com, which described the play as \\"gory,\\" \\"disturbing,\\" \\"ghastly,\\" \\"graphic, and grotesque,\\" the review went on to say \\"this off- broadway show is gory, freaky, and downright alarming.\\" Broadwaywrold described namesake protagonist, Dick Johnson, as a character you instantly hate, but \\"relatable in the most chilling way\\". Time Out New York added The Wake of Dick Johnson to its top-13 list of Halloween events. In December 2019 QC Nerve voted The Wake of Dick Johnson Critic's Pick \\"Best Of the Year 2019\\" for best one man show.  Controversy  Although he starred in the first three runs of the play, Walker never intended to play the part of Dick Johnson. The role was initially planned to be performed by his friend, and amateur actor, Michael P. Varian. After almost a year of rehearsals, and only months before the show's planned debut, Varian text messaged Walker from a Georgia rehab clinic informing him he could no longer play the role, claiming it had caused him to have a nervous breakdown. The play had a similar effect on Walker's former girlfriend, a minor social media influencer, who reacted so violently to the show's Charlotte premiere, she interrupted a post performance musical act on microphone to publicly disavow the play. She then took a further step of ratifying her position by promoting a large-scale social media smear campaign against him. The third incident of controversy was during the third run at ps122. So shocked was the theater director and manager over the graphic dialog and savagery of the character Uncle Willy, they threaten to prevent further performances unless Walker was prepared censor the entire play. Walker declined and the shows went on, but many attempts were made by the theater to prevent the remainder of shows from occurring. The third scheduled performance was canceled only hours before showtime on account of a bogus contractual loophole related to fire proofing certificates. During the remaining days, many other blatant acts of retaliation were carried out by theater management and staff including regular incidents of weaponized lighting, deliberately bungled sound and intermission cues, and frequent brazen disruptions of the performance by staff-members. Theater management also maliciously discarded thousands of dollars worth of programs and printed literature related to the show without Walker's consent. These absurd acts of sabotage were later highlighted by the revelation that paying ticket holders were blocked from entering the theater for the entire duration of the play's short run.  Reception  Although described as disturbing, grotesque, and highly controversial, to date the play received unanimous critical praise, calling it profound, poetic and fearlessly bleak. It was listed in Time Out New York Top-13 Halloween theater events along-side many world renowned plays such as The Glass Menagerie, Little Shop of Horrors, and Sleep No More.  Cast  * Luke H.

As a result, the Prince of Conde, military leader of the Reformers, moved into Orleans to turn it into one of his strongholds. The city became Protestant; only reformed worship was tolerated; its institutions (the governor, the city aldermen, etc.) became dominated by Protestants, the bishop was removed in April 1562 and churches were desecrated and relics destroyed. In 1563, Catholic troops led by the Duke of Guise set out to recapture Orleans, the defence of which was entrusted to the brother of Admiral de Coligny, Fran√ßois de Coligny d'Andelot. On 18 February 1563, when the position of the besieged had become difficult, Poltrot de Mere, a convicted Protestant, assassinated the Duke of Guise. This assassination precipitated a treaty between the two parties which led to the Edict of Amboise on 19 March 1563 and established peace between the two communities. Orleans continued to live under this treaty of conciliation until 1567. Tortorel and Perrissin.

It was put into force by the Military Defense National Defense Authorization Act for 1997. The Kyl‚ÄìBingaman Amendment (KBA) prohibits US authorities from granting a license for collecting or disseminating high resolution satellite imagery of Israel at a higher resolution than is available from other commercial sources, that is, from companies outside of the United States. An exception exists if this is done by a US federal agency, or if it is done in order to abolish the secrecy of such recordings. U.S. law mandates U.S. government censorship of American commercial satellite images of no country in the world besides that of Israel. The largest and most important global sources of commercial satellite imagery, such as Maxar Technologies, and the largest and widely-used online resources, such as Google and Bing, are American and this makes KBA a powerful instrument of U.S. government suppression of information.

Because of an Abrupt Reversal, Satellite Technology Can Now Be Used to Defend Palestinians‚Äô Human Rights\\" The amendment is named after United States Senators Jon Kyl and Jeff Bingaman. Image resolution limit In August 2017 the Advisory Committee on Commercial Remote Sensing (ACCRES), part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) which regulates the Kyl‚ÄìBingaman Amendment restrictions, announced a review of the current image resolution limit of 2 meter Ground Sampling Distance (GSD). This was done in response to evidence that commercial satellite companies outside the United States were selling images with resolution higher than that limit. Imagery of higher resolution than the 2m GSD limitation has been commercially available from companies outside of the United States since 2012. In March 2018 research by Andrea Zerbini and Michael Fradley at the University of Oxford demonstrated that imagery below the 2m limit covering Israel had been available since 2012 from the French company Airbus, and a number of other satellite companies had subsequently passed the 2m threshold, including the South Korean company Kompsat, who were producing a 0.4m GSD resolution from its K3A satellite. In its October 2018 review, the NOAA rejected the evidence that sub-2m imagery of Israel was available from commercial sources outside of the U.S., but was unable to counter the factual claims of Zerbini and Fradley or to publish its own research methodology. After a further review in 2019, the NOAA reversed itself and dropped the GSD limit to 0.4m in a decision published in the Federal Register on 21 July 2020. Impacts=Hindering observation of the Israeli occupation KBA's restriction on satellite image collection and dissemination has been extended to include the Palestinian territories and the Golan Heights. As a consequence, the law has obscured important aspects of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, including the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, demolitions of Palestinian homes by the Israeli government, and human rights abuses.Foreign Policy, 3 Aug 2020, Israel Can‚Äôt Hide Evidence of Its Occupation Anymore: For More than 20 Years, an Obscure U.S. Law Concealed Satellite Imagery of Israel‚Äôs Activities in the Occupied Territories.

The rivalry is largely bolstered because of the proximity between the two teams, with Toronto and Detroit approximately apart, connected by Ontario Highway 401, and a number of shared fans in between the two cities (particularly in markets such as Windsor, Ontario). The teams both compete in the Atlantic Division and with current NHL scheduling, they meet four times per season. Both teams are Original Six teams, with their first game played in Detroit's inaugural season in 1927. From 1929-1993, the two teams met each other in the 16 playoff series, and faced each other in seven Stanley Cup Finals. Meeting each other a combined 23 times in the postseason, the two teams have played each other in more postseason series than any other two teams in NHL history with the exception of the Bruins and Canadiens, who have played a total of 34 postseason series. Toronto has won 12 of the series. Foundation: 1927‚Äì42 The Windsor Arena (formerly Border City Arena) hosted the first game between Detroit and Toronto, as Detroit's home arena was still under construction. The series began on January 4, 1927, when the Toronto St. Patricks (renamed Maple Leafs the next month) met the Detroit Cougars (renamed Red Wings in 1932) for the first time. In the match-up, the St. Patricks earned a 2‚Äì1 victory against the Cougars at the Border Cities Arena (later renamed Windsor Arena) in Windsor Ontario. The Cougars played their home games in Windsor for the 1926‚Äì27 NHL season while their home arena, Olympia Stadium, was under construction. The Cougars played their first Stanley Cup playoff series against the Maple Leafs following the 1928‚Äì29 NHL season. The Maple Leafs won the series 2‚Äì0. The club scored in double digits for the first time in its history against the Maple Leafs, in a 10‚Äì1 rout at Olympia Stadium on December 25, 1930. The Maple Leafs recorded their own franchise record shutout on January 2, 1971, when the Maple Leafs shut out the Red Wings 13‚Äì0 at Maple Leaf Gardens. Both games would be the largest goal differential each team recorded on each other. The Red Wings won their first Stanley Cup in 1936, after defeating the Maple Leafs at Maple Leaf Gardens. However, the Maple Leafs won the next six Cup Finals played between the two teams. 1940 Stanley Cup playoff brawl The 1940 Stanley Cup semifinals between the Maple Leafs and Red Wings was especially notable with the second game devolving into a brawl. The tone of the game was set early when Maple Leafs' defenceman, Rudolph Kampman, injured Red Wings' forward Cecil Dillon who became unable to play the rest of the night. In the second period, Maple Leafs' Red Horner and Red Wings' Alex Motter fought on the ice and continued to do so in the penalty box with local police called in to break it up. Later in the same frame, Red Wings' Don Grosso lifted Maple Leafs' Hank Goldup over the boards, dropping him on the cement floor. Goldup had to be assisted off the ice. Near the end of the third period, Sid Abel scored for the Red Wings to narrow the Maple Leafs' lead to 3‚Äì1. However, a melee erupted when Abel and Maple Leafs' Gus Marker engaged one another. Within an instant, every player on the ice engaged an opponent in a fight, with players from both benches going over the boards to join them. The brawl lasted for more than 10 minutes with the last two engaged players being Jimmy Orlando and Horner. When peace was restored, the referee assessed majors and misconducts to Gus Marker and Abel, a major to Orlando, and a misconduct to Horner, who left the penalty box to join the altercation. At the games conclusion, Red Wings' coach Jack Adams had his own altercation. As the Red Wings headed towards their own dressing room, a fan attempted to assault Adams before he punched the fan himself. Original Six era: 1942‚Äì67 The rivalry between the Maple Leafs and Red Wings was at its height during the Original Six-era (1942‚Äì67), with the majority of Maple Leafs and Red Wings postseason meetings occurring in this period. The Maple Leafs and Red Wings met in the postseason six times during the 1940s, including four Stanley Cup finals. The Maple Leafs beat the Red Wings in five of their six meetings, except in the 1943 semifinals. In the 1950s, the Maple Leafs and Red Wings met one another in six Stanley Cup semifinals; the Red Wings beat the Maple Leafs in five of their six meetings, excluding the 1960 semifinals. From 1961 to 1967, the two teams met one another in three playoff series, including two Stanley Cup finals. Within those 25 years, the Maple Leafs and Red Wings played a total of 15 postseason series including six Cup Finals; the Maple Leafs beat the Red Wings in all six Cup Finals. 1942 Stanley Cup Finals Maple Leafs score on the Red Wings during the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals. The rivalry intensified in the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals. After losing the first three games, the Maple Leafs won the next four to win the series 4‚Äì3, winning their fourth Stanley Cup. It was the first Cup Final in history to go seven games, and the only time in North American sports that a team won a best-of- seven championship series, after losing the first three games. There were several tense moments throughout the series. In the fourth game, held in Detroit, the Maple Leafs staved off elimination with a 4‚Äì3 victory. The game ended in a near-riot when in the final minute, Red Wings' Eddie Wares drew a misconduct penalty and then a $50 fine for arguing and refusing to leave the ice. Referee Mel Harwood dropped the puck for the faceoff while Wares was still on the ice and he promptly called a too-many-men penalty on Don Grosso. Grosso threw down his stick and gloves and was fined $25 by Harwood. At the end of the game, Red Wings' coach Jack Adams attacked Harwood, punching him in the face following a profanity-laced outburst. The fans booed the officiating, littering the ice with paper, peanuts, and even a woman's shoe. NHL president Frank Calder and referee Harwood were escorted out of the rink under police protection. Calder immediately suspended Adams indefinitely and imposed $100 fines on Grosso and Wares. Game seven of the series was the first time a crowd of over 16,000 attended a hockey game in Canada. 16,218 fans squeezed into Maple Leaf Gardens and remained an hour after the game waiting for the Leafs to reappear from the dressing room. Coach Hap Day, who played for the Leafs in their last Stanley Cup win in 1932, deadpanned \\"We won it the hard way.\\" He was asked if he had any doubts during the series, and replied \\"I had my doubts right up until that final bell rang.\\" Rookie Gaye Stewart, who joined the club for the fifth game of the final, became the youngest player to win the Stanley Cup at the age of 18 years, and nine months. 1945 Stanley Cup Finals The Maple Leafs and Red Wings met in their third Cup Finals series in 1945. This series was the first Cup Final in NHL history where both teams started rookie goaltenders. In the first three games, Maple Leafs goaltender, Frank McCool did not allow the Red Wings to score a single goal. This was the first time one team shut out the other for the first three games in Stanley Cup Finals history. In addition, the Maple Leafs now stood one win away from sweeping the Red Wings, as the Red Wings' Mud Bruneteau noted after game three. However, the series played out similarly to the last time the two teams met in the Finals, in 1942, when the Maple Leafs, down 0‚Äì3 forced a seventh game, this time with Detroit winning the next three games to force a seventh game. In game four, the Maple Leafs had a chance to win the Cup at home, but the Red Wings got on the board for the first time in the series when Flash Hollett opened the scoring 8:35 into the game, ending McCool's shutout streak at 193:09 (dating back to the semifinals against Montreal). Four other Red Wings players, including rookie Ted Lindsay (who scored what transpired to be the game-winner at 3:20 of the third period), scored to overcome Ted Kennedy's hat trick. Games five and six were Harry Lumley's time to shine, shutting out the Leafs, including an overtime shutout in the sixth game, and extending the Finals. The series returned to Detroit for a seventh game, with the Red Wings hoping to avenge their \\"choking\\" against the Leafs in 1942. Maple Leafs' coach Hap Day almost had to eat his words of a few years back when he said of the Leafs' 1942 comeback from being down 3‚Äì0 in games, \\"There will never be another experience like this.\\" Babe Pratt, however, scored the winning goal in a 2‚Äì1 victory that saved the Maple Leafs from being victim of another comeback win by the Red Wings. Lumley left the ice almost immediately after the end of the game, but a Detroit Olympia crowd chant of \\"We want Lumley!\\" brought him back. This is the first time in the history of game sevens of the Stanley Cup Finals that the home team did not win. The home team did not lose a game seven final again until the Montreal Canadiens beat the Chicago Black Hawks in 1971. 1950s and 1960s By 1950, the two teams met one another 11 times in the post-season. The rivalry heightened to a fever pitch due to an incident in the 1950 playoffs when the Red Wings' young star, Gordie Howe, mistimed a check on Maple Leafs' Ted Kennedy and fell head-first into the boards, suffering severe injuries and needing emergency surgery to save his life. While Kennedy was exonerated by the NHL, Red Wings' management and fans accused him of deliberately injuring Howe. The result was a violent playoff series won by the Red Wings and increased animosity between the teams. The rivalry grew so fierce that when the New York Rangers reached the 1950 Stanley Cup Finals to face the Red Wings, but could not play in their home rink, Madison Square Garden, because the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus were using the arena, New York arranged to play home games in Toronto, whose fans held a deep enmity against the Red Wings. In the 1956 semifinals series between the Maple Leafs and the Red Wings, an anonymous caller to a Toronto newspaper claimed he would shoot Red Wings' stars Howe and Lindsay when they took the ice at Maple Leaf Gardens for game three. Howe and Lindsay combined for three goals in Detroit's 5‚Äì4 win, with Lindsay turning his stick like a rifle, pointing it at the Toronto crowd, circling the rink while making machine gun noises. The Red Wings would win the semifinals series 4‚Äì1. The rivalry further intensified in the 1950s when relations between Red Wings star Red Kelly and Red Wings General Manager Jack Adams had deteriorated. Angered over a magazine article where Kelly had suggested the Red Wings forced him to play with a broken ankle in the 1958‚Äì59 NHL season, Adams traded the all-star to the Maple Leafs. When the Maple Leafs eliminated the Red Wings in the 1960 playoffs, Kelly couldn't resist another jab at Adams, telling the Ottawa Journal \\"it's nice to be with a winner.\\" The teams met in two Cup Finals in 1963 and 1964. The 1964 Cup Finals became well known because of the heroics of Leafs defenceman Bobby Baun. In game six, he was taken off the ice with an injury that later would be diagnosed as a broken leg. Baun eventually returned to the game and scored the OT winner to even the series at 3‚Äì3. The Leafs went on to win game seven and win the Cup, part in thanks to Baun's unlikely heroics earlier in the series. Expansion and stagnation: 1968‚Äì2012 On March 27, 1973, Mickey Redmond scored two goals on Maple Leafs goalie Ron Low in a span of 18 seconds to become the Red Wings' first ever 50-goal scorer in an 8‚Äì1 victory. On November 5, 1975, in one of the scariest incidents to ever take place at Maple Leaf Gardens, Red Wings forward, Dan Maloney, repeatedly beat Maple Leafs defenceman Brian Glennie's head off the ice until he went limp. Maloney was charged with assault causing bodily harm, part of a crackdown on hockey violence by Ontario attorney general Roy McMurtry. A plea bargain left Maloney performing community service work while being banned from playing in Toronto for two years. Ironically, Maloney subsequently played for the Maple Leafs from 1977‚Äì82, then served as their head coach from 1984‚Äì86. On January 13, 1986, the Maple Leafs and Red Wings played a regular season game that involved a brawl lasting nearly 20 minutes. After the Leafs scored their sixth goal, the Red Wings' head coach, Brad Park, sent his players over the boards, and Leafs head coach Dan Maloney followed suit. During the brawl Maple Leafs assistant coach John Brophy attempted to engage Park, although he was held back by the usher. By the games conclusion, the Maple Leafs won 7‚Äì4, and over 281 minutes in penalties was assessed, with 171 minutes from the third-period brawl alone. Red Wings enforcer, Bob Probert, was issued a four-game suspension for head-butting, while Lane Lambert was given a three-game suspension for being the first Red Wing to leave the bench and instigate the brawl. Since the end of the Original Six-era, the Maple Leafs and Red Wings have met other only three times in the post-season. In those three series, the Red Wings beat the Maple Leafs twice, in the 1987 Norris Division Finals and 1988 Norris Division Semifinals. The Maple Leafs beat the Red Wings in the last series they played one another, the 1993 Norris Division Semifinals. In the seventh game of the 1993 Norris Division Semifinals, Maple Leafs' Nikolai Borschevsky's shot the game-winner in overtime past Red Wings goaltender Tim Cheveldae hushing the fans inside Joe Louis Arena. The goal gave the underdog Leafs a shocking first-round series victory over Steve Yzerman's heavily favoured Red Wings. Borschevsky's game seven overtime goal gave Toronto the series and made them the sixth club to eliminate a team with a better regular season record in the first round of the playoffs. This was also the Maple Leafs' first playoff series win against the Red Wings since the 1964 Cup Finals. The rivalry stagnated during the mid-1990s and 2000s, when the Maple Leafs moved from the Western Conference (formerly the Clarence Campbell Conference), to the Eastern Conference (formerly the Prince of Wales Conference) to begin the 1998‚Äì99 NHL season, leaving the Maple Leafs and Red Wings in separate conferences for 15 years. Because of NHL scheduling for interconference play, the Maple Leafs and Red Wings played one another as little as once a year. The two teams were returned to the same division prior to the 2013‚Äì14 NHL season with the Red Wings moving to the Eastern Conference and being placed in the new Atlantic Division of which the Maple Leafs were located. Modern era: 2013‚Äìpresent The Maple Leafs and Red Wings played each other in the 2014 NHL Winter Classic. Playing in the same division for the first time since 1998, the Red Wings hosted the Maple Leafs for the 2014 NHL Winter Classic at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor. In front of an NHL record crowd of 105,491, and the largest Canadian and American television audiences for a regular season game in NHL history, the Maple Leafs beat the Red Wings 3‚Äì2 in a shootout.Frigid temps, snow, deliver Classic screen NHL.com, January 2, 20142014 Bridgestone NHL Winter Classic watched by record 8.2 million viewers across North America NHL.com, January 3, 2014 The rivalry may have heightened in 2015 with the signing of former Red Wings coach, Mike Babcock, as the new coach of the Leafs. After failing to come to terms on a contract extension with the Red Wings, Babcock requested and received permission to seek employment elsewhere. The Buffalo Sabres were considered the most serious contenders for Babcock's services, with the St. Louis Blues and San Jose Sharks also in the mix.Wawrow, John (May 19, 2015). AP source: Babcock in contract talks with Buffalo Sabres. Associated Press. Retrieved May 19, 2015. However, on May 20, 2015, it was announced that Babcock would become the new head coach of the Maple Leafs.Mike Babcock named Maple Leafs head coach He reportedly received an eight-year deal worth $50 million ($6.25 million per season average), and will be the highest paid coach in NHL history. A re-match of the 2014 Winter Classic was held on January 1, 2017; the NHL Centennial Classic at BMO Field in Toronto to commemorate the Maple Leafs' and the NHL's 100th season. Once again, the Maple Leafs beat the Red Wings, winning 5‚Äì4 after an overtime goal by Auston Matthews.

After finishing unplaced in her only start as a two- year-old in 2005 she improved to become a top class miler in the following year, when she won seven consecutive races including the Sandringham Handicap, Oak Tree Stakes and Matron Stakes. She defeated male opposition to win the Lockinge Stakes in 2007 and added a win in the Hungerford Stakes later that year before being retired from racing. As a broodmare for the Coolmore Stud she has made a considerable impact, producing several winners including the outstanding racemare Found. Background Red Evie is a bay mare with no white markings bred by Dermot Cantillon & Forenaghts at Tinnakill House in County Laois, Ireland. She was sired by Intikhab, a miler best known for his wide-margin victories in the Diomed Stakes and Queen Anne Stakes in as a four- year-old in 1998. His other offspring have included the outstanding middle- distance filly Snow Fairy. Red Evie's dam Malafemmena showed some ability as a racehorse, winning the Listed Premio Vittorio Crespi in Italy as a two-year- old in 1994. She was a granddaughter of Pavlova a half-sister to the Ascot Gold Cup winner Random Shot. Malafemmena died foaling Red Evie and the filly was raised by a foster mare. Remembering Red Evie's early days Dermot Cantillon described her as \\"a lovely foal, but independent. Impossible to catch in the field\\". As a foal in November 2003, Red Evie was consigned to the Goffs sale in Ireland and was bought for ‚Ç¨50,000 by Camas Park Stud. In October 2004 the filly was offered for sale as a yearling at Tattersalls in England and was sold for 58,000 guineas by the bloodstock agents Kern, Lillingston Association. She entered the ownership of Terry Neil and was sent into training with Michael Bell at Newmarket, Suffolk. Bell's wife Georgina also owned a share in the filly and regularly rode her in training gallops. Racing career=2005: two-year-old season Red Evie made her first appearance in a maiden race over one mile (eight furlongs) at Newmarket Racecourse on 20 September in which she was ridden by Jamie Mackay and started a 100/1 outsider. She looked outpaced by her rivals and finished ninth of the seventeen runners, thirteen lengths behind the John Dunlop-trained Bunood. Commenting a year later, Michael Bell said \\"She had showed us enough to warrant retaining her. She was a big, scopey sort and we turned her out for three months to let her grow a bit\\". 2006: three-year-old season From the start of her second season, Jamie Spencer took over as Red Evie's regular jockey. On the filly's first run of 2006 she started at odds of 8/1 for a maiden over seven furlongs at Yarmouth Racecourse on 29 March and recorded her first success, taking the lead approaching the final furlong and winning by one and three quarter lengths despite being eased down by Spencer in the final strides. At the same track in April she was ridden by Kieren Fallon in a one- mile handicap race in which she was assigned a weight of 122 pounds. Starting the 2/1 favourite she overcame trouble in running in the early stages to take the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and won by two lengths from the Clive Brittain-trained Kaveri. Spencer was back in the saddle on 20 May when Red Evie started favourite for a seven furlong handicap at Newbury Racecourse and won \\"easily\\" from fifteen opponents. She returned to the track ten days later for a minor race over seven furlongs at Leicester Racecourse in which she started odds-on favourite and won \\"comfortably\\" by a length and a half from the Henry Cecil-trained Star Cluster, having taken the lead two furlongs out. Red Evie contested her most important race up to that time at Royal Ascot when she contested the Listed Sandringham Handicap, a race in which she was assigned a weight of 124 pounds. She was one of three co-favourites on 5/1 alongside La Mottie and Makderah in a field of nineteen fillies. After being restrained in the early stages she was switched right by Spencer to obtain a clear run in the last quarter mile and produced a strong late run to catch La Mottie in the final stride and win by a head. On 4 August at Goodwood Racecourse, Red Evie attempted to take her winning run to six when she was moved up to Group Three level for the Oak Tree Stakes. She was ridden for the first and only time by Frankie Dettori and was made the 15/8 favourite, with the best-fancied of her eight opponents being Makderah and Spinning Queen. She raced towards the rear of the field before making rapid progress in the last quarter mile, overtaking Makderah inside the final furlong and winning \\"readily\\" by half a length. In September Red Evie was sent to Ireland and was moved up to Group One level for the Matron Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse. Nannina started favourite ahead of Peeress and Flashy Wings (Lowther Stakes) with Red Evie the 6/1 fourth choice in an eight-runner field. After racing in sixth place she was switched to the outside to make her challenge in the straight. She took the lead a furlong out and held off the strong late challenge of Peeress to win by a short head and record her seventh consecutive victory. Michael Bell said \\"She has the most amazing racing temperament and will to win, and, unusually, because things generally go wrong rather than right, a copybook season. Her health, preparation, race plans and riding have all gone smoothly. And added to that she's a very determined young lady... [she] has bags of courage. I'd back her in a dogfight.\\" After racing on good to firm ground for most of the season, Red Evie ended her campaign in the Sun Chariot Stakes on softer ground at Newmarket in October. She began to struggle before half way and was eased down by Spencer to finish tailed-off last of the five runners behind Peeress, Soviet Song, Alexander Goldrun and Musicanna. 2007: four-year-old season On her four-year-old debut, Red Evie took on male opposition for the first time in the Group One Lockinge Stakes at Newbury on 19 May. She started at odds of 8/1 against seven opponents including Peeress, Ramonti, Jeremy (Sandown Mile), Speciosa, Marcus Andronicus (runner- up in the Poule d'Essai des Poulains) and Passager (Prix Perth). After being held up as usual she began to make progress under pressure in the last quarter mile. She went to the front inside the final furlong and \\"held on gamely\\" to win in a three-way photo finish from Ramonti and Passager. After the race Michael Bell said \\"There was a big temptation to retire her last year, but these good fillies don‚Äôt come around too often, so we kept her in training. We‚Äôll have a lot of fun with her this season\\". Red Evie was well beaten in her next two races. At Royal Ascot in June she finished seventh behind Ramonti in the Queen Anne Stakes after fading in the closing stages. In the following month at Goodwood she returned to all-female competition for the Falmouth Stakes but again faded in the final furlong and finished last of the seven runners behind Simply Perfect. On 18 August Red Evie was dropped in class and distance for the Group Two Hungerford Stakes over seven furlongs at Newbury and started the 5/1 third favourite behind Silver Touch (Criterion Stakes) and Wake Up Maggie (Chartwell Fillies' Stakes, Oak Tree Stakes) whilst the other runners included Welsh Emperor (winner of the race in 2006), Caradak (Prix de la For√™t) and Stronghold (Supreme Stakes). In a contest run in muddy, \\"filthy\\" conditions she raced towards the rear of the ten-runner field before producing her customary strong finish, caught the leader Welsh Emperor in the final stride and won by a short head. Spencer explained \\"She idled and I didn't get sight of Micky Fenton's horse [Welsh Emperor] until late, but I arrived there on the line. She got flattened at Royal Ascot, has never run well at Newmarket and on the gallops she can't beat a donkey\\". In the autumn of 2007 Michael Bell commented on the filly's approach to training and racing saying \\"She hides her capabilities at home, but produces it on the track. There's nothing to be won on the gallops and, as a trainer, you'd always prefer it that way round\\". In September Red Evie was sent to Ireland and attempted to repeat her 2006 success in the Matron Stakes. She finished strongly but was beaten one and a half lengths into second place by the Michael Stoute-trained Echelon. On her final appearance the filly was sent to France for the Prix de la For√™t over 1400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in October. Racing on soft ground she never looked likely to win and finished tenth of the thirteen runners behind the German-trained outsider Toylsome. Breeding record At the end of her racing career Red Evie was offered for sale in December 2007 at Tattersalls but failed to reach her reserve price of 1,000,000 guineas. She was later bought privately and became a broodmare for the Coolmore Stud. Her foals have included: *Red Corvette, a bay filly, foaled in 2009, sired by Galileo. Unraced *Magical Dream, bay filly, 2010, by Galileo. Won two races including C L Weld Park Stakes. *Iniesta, bay colt, 2011, by Galileo. Won one race. *Found, bay filly, 2012, by Galileo.

It was released by Fuel Records in 2011. All ten tracks from Newton's 1998 album The Trouble With Angels were included in this release (in remixed form) along with ten other recordings from various other Newton albums and one new track. An iTunes edition added two more tracks. Overview=Background Juice Newton began her recording career in 1975 but did not achieve major stardom until the release of her 1981 album Juice. The album was a crossover success and yielded three hit singles, \\"Angel of the Morning\\", \\"Queen of Hearts\\", and \\"The Sweetest Thing (I've Ever Known)\\". The last of these peaked at number one on the Billboard Country Chart. She followed Juice with Quiet Lies (1982), an album that brought her two more hits, \\"Love's Been a Little Bit Hard on Me\\" and \\"Break It to Me Gently\\", of which the latter earned her the Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Female. Newton's 1985 album Old Flame was her country breakthrough, spawning three number one hits \\"You Make Me Want to Make You Mine\\", \\"Hurt\\", and the duet with Eddie Rabbitt \\"Both to Each Other (Friends & Lovers)\\" and also three additional Top Ten hits: \\"Old Flame\\", \\"Cheap Love\\", and \\"What Can I Do with My Heart\\". After two more albums (Emotion and Ain't Gonna Cry) Newton concentrated more on concert performing. Newton returned to recording in 1998 with her album The Trouble With Angels, a collection made up largely of new renditions of her previous hits. The following year she released American Girl. In the mid-1990s Newton began recording a series of duets. Initially these were conceived to be a double album that would be released via a television infomercial. However legal problems kept them from being officially issued for many years. What finally emerged was a single disc collection of 10 songs released in 2010 as Duets: Friends & Memories. In the meantime, Newton made a concert video, Every Road Leads Back to You, and a Christmas album, The Gift of Christmas. Ultimate Hits Juice Newton's The Ultimate Hits Collection was released as a budget-priced anthology by Fuel Records on July 7, 2011. For the album's content Fuel used all ten tracks from The Trouble With Angels thus rejecting many of Newton's actual hits by including later re- recordings in their place. Therefore this collection does not contain any of the recordings from her \\"breakthrough\\" album Juice. The only vintage hit records included are \\"Hurt\\", \\"Tell Her No\\", \\"Heart of the Night\\", and \\"A Little Love\\" from, respectively, the Old Flame, Dirty Looks, Quiet Lies, and Can't Wait All Night albums. Four songs from American Girl along with a duet with Willie Nelson from Duets: Friends & Memories are also included. The only previously unreleased recording in the collection is \\"Sweet Sweet Smile\\", a song written by Newton with her long-time collaborator Otha Young that had been a minor hit for The Carpenters in 1978. The Ultimate Hits Collection has been made available from iTunes with two extra songs taken from The Gift of Christmas.

It is located inside the north wing of former Tegernsee Abbey and is owned by Maria Anna, Duchess in Bavaria, youngest daughter of Max, Duke in Bavaria. History The company traces its roots back to a brewery that was allegedly founded in the year 1050 at lake Tegernsee, where in 746 Benedictine Tegernsee Abbey was established. However the documented history can only be traced back to 1675 when abbot Bernd Wenzel relocated the monastery's brewing right from Holzkirchen to Tegernsee. A Benedictine monastery not per se brewed beer. In fact, at the time of the monastery, most monks in Bavaria favored wine over beer. Duke Maximilian I compiled a list with all Bavarian breweries in 1604. Tegernsee was not mentioned. And if the monastery already had owned a brewing facility, the relocation of the right from Holzkirchen in 1675 wouldn't have been necessary. So, it's safe to assume that there probably hasn't been a brewery before the first half of the 17th century. [Source needed?] Since then, the brewery has operated under a number of different names, including Tegernseer Klosterbrauerei (\\"Tegernsee Monastic Brewery\\"). After the secularization in the beginning of the 19th century, it was purchased in 1817 by Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria from Karl Joseph von Drechsel and incorporated under the name K√∂niglich braunes Brauhaus Tegernsee (\\"Royal Brown Brewhouse of Tegernsee\\"). Since then, it has been in the ownership of the House of Wittelsbach.  Corporation Today's company behind the brewery is named Herzoglich Bayerisches Brauhaus Tegernsee KG and is still based in Tegernsee. In 2011 another filling line was erected in Gmund, only away. Inside the same building as the main production facility, restaurant Herzogliches Br√§ust√ºberl Tegernsee is located. The widely known Br√§ust√ºberl (\\"Brewpub\\") serves mainly Tegernseer Beer, yet is an independent company, led by Peter Hubert. Beers of Brauhaus Tegernsee were for a long time mainly popular in the local district of Miesbach. Yet lately the brand is marketed all over Germany.

Life Ubayd Allah's father, Yahya, was a Khurasani from Marw in the service of al- Hasan ibn Sahl, the vizier to Caliph al-Ma'mun (). His career culminated under Caliph al-Mutawakkil () as head of the dƒ´wƒÅn al-kharƒÅj and director of the tribunal of ma·∫ìƒÅlim (\\"grievances\\"). Thus, Ubayd Allah enjoyed the favour of al-Mutawakkil, who appointed him as his private secretary. In ca. 851, the Caliph appointed Ubayd Allah to the vizierate, which had been vacant for some time,The last incumbent had been Muhammad ibn al-Fadl al-Jarjara'i. . and granted his prot√©g√© significant powers, in particular as regards the appointment of officials, thereby establishing his control over the administrative apparatus. In addition, Ubayd Allah also served as tutor to one of al-Mutawakkil's sons. Throughout the reign, Ubayd Allah played a major role and was, along with al-Fath ibn Khaqan (no relation), one of the main influences on the Caliph, particularly as a driving force behind al- Mutawakkil's anti-Alid policies. During his tenure, he is known to have promoted the career of Ahmad ibn Tulun, the future founder of the Tulunid dynasty. With the aid of his aides al-Hasan ibn Makhlad and Musa ibn Abd al- Malik, he was instrumental in the downfall of the head of the dƒ´wƒÅn al-tawqƒ´ ø (a bureau responsible for drafting edicts and registering government officials), Najah ibn Salamah, in early 860. Najah and his sons were imprisoned and their possessions confiscated, while Najah died in prison on 18 February 860. Along with al-Fath ibn Khaqan, Ubayd Allah supported al- Mutawakkil's intention to entrust his son al-Mu'tazz as his successor, over al-Muntasir, who was backed by the Turkish and Maghariba guard troops. On the night of 10 December 861, when the Turks‚Äîcertainly with the tacit approval, if not instigation, of al-Muntasir‚Äîmurdered al-Mutawwakil and al-Fath ibn Khaqan, Ubayd Allah was saved because he was still working late at his office. After hearing the commotion and learning of what had transpired, Ubayd Allah and his entourage escaped the palace‚Äîthey had to break down the locked doors to do so‚Äîand, reaching the banks of the Tigris, took boats to the downriver residence of al-Mu'tazz. They were too late, however, as al-Mu'tazz had been duped into going to the palace and acknowledging his brother as caliph. According to one report in al-Tabari, Ubayd Allah and al-Fath ibn Khaqan had been forewarned of the plot by a Turkish woman, but had disregarded it, confident that no-one would dare carry it out. Following the murder of al- Mutawakkil, Ubayd Allah withdrew from politics, and in 862‚Äì867 was even exiled to Barqa. On the accession of al-Mu'tamid () in June 870, he was re-appointed vizier, keeping the post until his death. According to Ibn al-Jawzi, he died on 5 August 877 from a blow received during a polo match. The famous historian al-Tabari was tutor to Ubayd Allah's sons, reportedly at ten gold dinars a month. One of his sons, Muhammad, also became vizier in 912‚Äì913, and was an enemy of Ali ibn al-Furat. Muhammad's son Abdallah also served briefly as vizier in 924‚Äì925.

He has been imam of the Lewisham Islamic Centre in London since 1998. He has played a role in the British Muslim community, has been invited to speak at mosques and Islamic events, and has been a spokesman for the Muslim community at events and in press releases. Begg was instrumental in attempting to secure the release by ISIS of British hostage Alan Henning. He lost a court case on 28 October 2016 in which he sued the BBC for libel for calling him an extremist. The ruling was notable for the level of the court, the prominence of the defendant, the fact that a representative of the British Muslim community was the plaintiff and its probable precedence for future cases.  Background and education  Begg grew up in South London, and was educated in the London Borough of Lewisham. He studied at the Islamic University of Madinah and reportedly has an M.A. degree in Islamic studies from the Markfield Institute of Higher Education, diplomas in Islamic jurisprudence and Islamic finance, and a certificate in Islamic chaplaincy.  Role in the British Muslim community  Begg has been chief imam and khatib of the Lewisham Islamic Centre since 1998. The mosque, at which the killers of Lee Rigby had worshipped, was a 2016 participant in the Muslim Council of Britain's \\"Visit my Mosque\\" programme. He has been prominent in the British Muslim community, has been invited to speak at mosques and Islamic events, and has been a spokesman for the Muslim community at events and in press releases (including attempts to secure the release by ISIS of British hostage Alan Henning). Begg was Muslim chaplain at Goldsmiths, University of London. Begg was interviewed in the 2009 British Film Institute film, Outside the Law: Stories from Guant√°namo. He participated in a 2013 event, \\"Freedom of Speech ‚Äì Are Muslims Excluded?\\", organised by the non-profit organisation ENGAGE. The following year, Begg spoke at the CAGE \\"Is it a crime to care for Syria and Gaza?\\" event; \\"hundreds of people turned up to listen to prominent Muslim speakers from different political organisations and theological backgrounds ‚Äì moderates, conservatives, Islamists and democrats.\\" He has participated in an interfaith press release. In 2014, Begg and other British imams also approached ISIS about the release of British hostage Alan Henning.  Libel case - court rules him an Islamic Extremist Begg took the BBC to court for libel in 2015 (see Defamation in the United Kingdom), alleging that the corporation had labelled him an extremist; in November 2013, presenter Andrew Neil had said on Sunday Politics that Begg had called jihad the greatest of deeds. In his summing-up of the case on 28 October 2016, Mr Justice Charles Haddon-Cave said: \\"Begg clearly promotes and encourages violence in support of Islam and espouses a series of extremist Islamic positions. On occasions when it has suited him ... he has shed the cloak of respectability and revealed the horns of extremism.\\" The judge gave a 10-point definition of Islamic extremism, and said that four of Begg's speeches indicated that he promoted such violence; in two speeches, the imam espoused extremist positions. \\"Shakeel Begg is something of a Jekyll and Hyde character,\\" Haddon-Cave said. \\"He appears to present one face to the general, local and inter-faith community and another to particular Muslim and other receptive audiences. The former face is benign, tolerant and ecumenical. The latter face is ideologically extreme and intolerant.\\" In a 2006 speech, Begg encouraged a student audience to fight in the Palestinian territories. In a tape-recorded speech at Kingston University obtained by the Sunday Times, Begg (who was a Muslim chaplain at Goldsmiths College, part of London University) said: \\"You want to make jihad? Very good ... Take some money and go to Palestine and fight, fight the terrorists, fight the Zionists.\\"Taher, Abul and Gadher, Dipesh.'Sunday Times', London, November 12, 2006. Two years later, he praised Muslims who had travelled abroad to fight enemies of Islam. A third speech outside the maximum security Belmarsh Prison in south-east London,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMFyU4WcwDI which holds some of the most dangerous terrorism convicts in the country, was described by the judge as \\"particularly sinister\\": A spokesman for the BBC said, \\"We were right to stand by the journalism of the Sunday Politics. The judge has concluded, based on the evidence, that Imam Begg has preached religious violence and an extremist worldview in his remarks.\\" In The Spectator, Douglas Murray wondered how Begg could continue as imam of the Lewisham Islamic Centre. On 29 October 2016, his mosque released a statement: > We the Trustees of The Lewisham Islamic Centre (LIC) confirm our unequivocal > and unwavering continued support of our Head Imam. We reassert that Imam > Begg is not an extremist, has never espoused extremist views, nor is he by > any stretch of the imagination an extremist speaker ... We are truly > disappointed and disturbed by this judgement, by its skew replete with > incorrect and fanciful assumptions that rely unequivocally on the > speculative, specious and rigid testimony of one ‚Äúexpert‚Äù witness - even > when this testimony clearly contradicts the Quran and authentic Hadiths of > Prophet Muhammed (pbuh) ‚Äì as representing the myriad of normative Islamic > opinions ... We shall continue to review this judgement. In November 2016, the centre published a response from Begg on their website: > My legal team and I are continuing to study the judgment very carefully and > we are considering all options, including an appeal ... In the meantime, it > is important for the public, both Muslims and non-Muslims to understand that > this is a civil case of defamation, which I pursued to restore my > reputation. Even though the ruling has gone in the BBC‚Äôs favour, it is > important to stress that the BBC and Andrew Neil have not been 'cleared' of > anything, and I have not been 'convicted' of anything ... I will be making > further comments regarding this issue in the near future. The case has been cited in legal textbooks. A March 2017 Henry Jackson Society report examined how Begg had established himself as an influential figure within numerous public bodies and groups, even after the court ruling that he was an Islamic extremist. That month, the Citizens UK charity reported itself to the Charity Commission because it had promoted Begg after the court ruling, in breach of the duty of a charity not to promote extremism.  Preaching and teaching  In 2009 Begg preached a sermon, \\"Neo-Salafi Movement: Is it Obligatory (Fard) to call one's self a Salafi?\\", which prompted criticism from some Muslim quarters. That year he spoke at a \\"Heroes of Islam\\" event supporting Aafia Siddiqui, who had been convicted on two counts of attempted murder. In 2014, Begg wrote about life as an imam in the United Kingdom. The following year, he spoke at the \\"Citizens Not Subjects\\" CAGE event and co- signed a letter to the House of Lords concerning a counter-terrorism and security bill. In November 2018, activists of the Labour Party were condemned for inviting Begg, as a known extremist preacher, to an anti-racism rally.

Reportedly sick, his mother Julia Biryukova said she put him and his older sister in the car along a Bellevue street to go to a nearby hospital; along the way she stated that she ran out of gas, leaving Sky in the car while she went to get help. She said that when she returned after being gone about an hour and a half, he was gone. He has not been seen since. The situation was reported to police, who soon came to doubt Biryukova's account since her car was found to have enough gas in its tank and was in working order. Her description of the incident also shared similarities with an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit that had been rebroadcast in the Seattle area the night before. Shortly before, Biryukova had decided to withdraw from a mediated custody agreement that was the last stage of an acrimonious divorce from Sky's father, Solomon Metalwala. Solomon has remained active in assisting police with the investigation, believing Sky's disappearance was related to the custody dispute. Biryukova has not been fully cooperative with the police, although she claims to have no more idea than her ex-husband of what happened to Sky. Although there have been allegations that she neglected Sky when he was in her custody, and state child-welfare agencies have tried to remove a child she had with a later husband with a history of abuse, police have made a \\"strategic decision\\" not to charge her with child endangerment for leaving her son in the car on the day he disappeared, to keep their options open if they learn more about Sky's fate. Background Both of Sky's parents were immigrants to the United States. Solomon Metalwala is originally from Pakistan; Julia Biryukova is a Ukrainian born in Russia, where she later claimed to have been subjected to shock therapy in mental hospitals during her childhood as punishment, in addition to regular disciplinary beatings by her parents, with serious negative effects on her self-esteem as a result. Solomon had been running a convenience store when the two met. Biryukova met her future husband at age 15, in 1997, three years after emigrating from Russia. At that time she was a student at Bellevue High School. Metalwala, then 21, invited her to a party. The two began dating, and she worked at a restaurant his family owned in Seattle's Pioneer Square neighborhood. By 1999, when she finished high school and was naturalized, the couple bought a Bellevue condominium to live in. While Biryukova and Metalwala enjoyed work and many leisure activities together, there was some friction between them. Police in Kirkland were called when the couple were seen arguing loudly at a local gas station over their plans for the evening. The man gave his name as Sulaiman Metalwala, supposedly Solomon's brother. Biryukova later told a clinical psychologist she saw that by this point she had learned that her boyfriend could be \\"very controlling\\" and she became emotionally dependent on him in turn. Nevertheless, in 2003, she married him in a brief ceremony in his mother's kitchen. Later she said his family gave her the choice of either doing so or never seeing him again, since they claimed he was facing imminent deportation, for reasons that are not known. Biryukova later claimed that she did not tell her family the real reason the two had wed until 2010. In 2005 Metalwala converted to Christianity; he and his wife began attending a church in Kirkland. Biryukova believed that her in-laws blamed her for this, straining their relationship with her and causing more problems in their marriage. Within two years they were experiencing financial problems as well, when a competing deli opened next to their restaurant, cutting into their earnings. Daughter Maile, their first child, was born in 2007. Business further declined in the Great Recession that began in 2008. Despite those setbacks, the two bought a home in Kirkland that year for over $800,000, in addition to the mortgage payments they still had to make on their Bellevue residence. Sky was born in 2009; a psychiatrist Biryukova saw prescribed her antidepressants while she was pregnant although she said she did not need them. By then lenders were beginning to foreclose the family's properties and they were in arrears on many of their bills. They had to move out of the Kirkland home and into the smaller Bellevue residence. Solomon claimed in later court papers that at this time, his wife's psychological problems began to manifest themselves, causing him to begin eating outside and sleeping on the floor to comply with her obsession with keeping the condominium clean. The board cited the couple several times for violating noise regulations; at one point they awoke their neighbors with vacuuming after 11 p.m. She, in turn, alleged he became controlling and angry. When the boy was two months old his parents left him alone in their car in a Target parking lot for almost an hour on a day when the outdoor temperature was . Both parents were arrested after police had them paged to their car and charged with reckless endangerment. They claimed they had been inside only for 20 minutes and did not want to wake him, but the store's security camera video footage disproved them. After they agreed to take a parenting class, charges were dropped several years later. Divorce On Biryukova's 29th birthday, in early 2010, she was briefly committed to a mental hospital for the first of three times, after telling Solomon she had dreamed of killing the children. There, she was diagnosed with severe obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD); however psychiatrists did not believe that rendered her unfit to parent a child and she would later deny that she had been so diagnosed. Shortly after she got out, her husband filed for divorce. Later Biryukova would be committed again. After the couple separated she texted her husband claiming to have suicidal ideations, which she later claimed she had done just to get his attention. Upon her admittance to the third hospital, she was found to have a Global Assessment of Functioning score of 15, suggesting she was a danger to herself and others; it had improved to 40, meaning slight impairment, by the time she was released. After that release, Solomon and his brother took Biryukova to University of Washington Medical Center where she checked in voluntarily. While she was there, their lender foreclosed on the condominium. Solomon moved with the children to his parents' home in Kirkland. The couple vigorously contested the divorce. Biryukova alleged in her filings that Solomon had been abusive and that she feared for her life. He claimed that the allegations were fabricated, and said her mental problems made her unstable, incapable of keeping food in the house or letting her children sleep in beds due to her OCD. Child Protective Services investigated a claim that Solomon had injured his daughter but supposedly ruled it unfounded; nevertheless Solomon was prohibited from seeing his children for a year while it was investigated. At different times in the case, both sought protection orders against each other. In September 2010, the court awarded Biryukova full custody of both children. She refused to let them see Solomon, who did not have any visitation rights. He continued to press the issue in court, along with some other issues such as property they both owned. She offered to forego alimony and child support if he let her move to Arizona with the children, but he refused. These disputes continued for over a year. In November 2011 the court hearing the case ordered the couple into a week of mediation to resolve their issues. The session was reportedly a success, with the two eventually agreeing that Biryukova would have custody of both children while Solomon had full visitation. However, on November 3, shortly after the agreement had been signed, Biryukova called her lawyer and, saying she had felt pressured into the session, decided to void it. Disappearance Biryukova says her son woke up sick in their Redmond apartment on the morning of November 6. She has said she put him and his sister in the car she was driving at the time, a silver 1998 two-door Acura Integra, and headed for the Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue. She later stated that around the 2600 block of 112th Street N.E. in that city, a long section of the road that follows a tall concrete noise barrier around the curve of the Washington State Route 520 expressway, just west of its interchange with Interstate 405, she ran out of gas. Biryukova parked the car on the side of the road. She said she left Sky strapped into his car seat inside while she took Maile to find assistance, reaching a Chevron station a mile (1.6 km) north of where she parked an hour later. Instead of buying gas or asking someone to bring it to her car, she called a friend, who came and picked her up and gave her a ride back to her car. She said that when she returned, she discovered that Sky was gone. She called police and reported him missing. They, in turn, contacted Solomon before noon that day. Investigation Searchers combed a 20-block radius of the car but found nothing. Police soon came to doubt Biryukova's account. Her car, when tested, proved to have adequate fuel in its tank and operated normally. In an hour wandering the neighborhood before she got to the gas station, she apparently made little effort to seek help from residents. She had left her home with a purportedly sick child but not taken her wallet, purse and phone. No gas can was found in the car. When questioned further about this, Biryukova took her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to take a lie detector test. Biryukova did, however, give investigators permission to search the car, her computer and her home. There was no sign of Sky at or near the latter location. Her car was unlocked and did not show any signs of forced entry. Police searched Solomon's house, too, and found nothing. After a lie-detector test he took the night after the disappearance proved inconclusive, Solomon took another one the next day, although neither he, his attorney, nor the police shared the results with the public. Police also soon learned about the 2009 incident where she and Solomon had been arrested after leaving Sky in the car unattended. During the investigation both of them admitted to having left the children by themselves for long periods of time. Detectives would not confirm whether, according to some reports, Biryukova had done so during the lengthy mediation hearing the week before Sky went missing. There were some questions about whether Sky had even been in the car that morning to begin with. Motorists who had passed the parked Acura did not report seeing anything unusual, not even a child in it. At Biryukova's apartment complex in Redmond, neighbors said she and her children rarely went out, and none of them had seen Sky for at least two weeks. Solomon was not aware of anyone having seen his son other than his ex- wife since an April doctor visit. However, Maile told the police that Sky had indeed been in the car that morning. The theory that Sky's disappearance might have been arranged by Biryukova drew more credence when police learned of strong coincidences between her story and a recently aired episode of the popular crime drama Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. In the episode, titled \\"Missing Pieces\\", a young couple claims their baby son has been abducted when their parked car was stolen. It is later learned that they buried the boy believing they accidentally killed him and made up the abduction as a cover story. The episode, first broadcast two weeks earlier, had been rerun the night before Sky vanished. \\"I know that there are several folks up in the operations center of the command post that have taken a look at that episode,\\" Major Mike Johnson of the Bellevue police told reporters, \\"and have commented that it is strikingly similar in nature.\\" Through his attorney, Solomon told People that Law & Order was his wife's favorite show. Biryukova's presence on the Internet also aroused interest. On her Facebook page, she had posted many pictures of Maile but almost none of Sky. During the previous months, she had also posted a profile to seekingarrangements.com, a dating website for women seeking \\"sugar daddies\\", wealthy men willing to support a younger woman financially as part of a romantic relationship. She sought \\"financial stability\\", as well as $3,000‚Äì5,000 in cash per month. Investigators stated publicly that they did not believe Biryukova's story and suspected criminal activity had occurred. However they did not formally describe her as a suspect or person of interest, nor did they charge her with child endangerment despite the circumstances of the case and her past arrest, along with her then- husband, for leaving Sky in the car unsupervised. The decision not do so, they said later, was a \\"strategic decision\\"; in order to secure a conviction, police and prosecutors would have to prove that they believe Biryukova did in fact leave her son alone in the vehicle for an unreasonable length of time. But if evidence later emerged suggesting Sky had been murdered or kidnapped that implicated his mother in some capacity, evidence that suggested he had never been in the car to begin with, arresting her on charges that she had indeed left him there could make a prosecution for the more serious charges impossible, a police spokesman said. Later, Solomon's lawyer told the Seattle Weekly another reason for the inaction: If police did arrest Biryukova, she and her attorney would be able to review all the evidence the police had accumulated up to that point, which neither they nor Solomon wanted her to be able to do. Subsequent developments Two weeks after Sky disappeared, Biryukova finally discussed the case with the media. ABC News obtained an email address that her relatives said was hers and used it to contact her. She reiterated that she had no idea where the boy was and called her ex-husband a \\"sadistic Muslim Pakistani\\" who was not telling the truth himself. About the case itself, she said her lawyer had instructed her not to discuss it with anyone; she ignored a specific question about whether she had indeed run out of gas that morning. The network was unable to confirm whether it was indeed Biryukova who had responded to them, as she was known to be staying with relatives at the time. However, Solomon told them it sounded to him like the way she would have talked. \\"Obviously she's just trying to maybe get me kind of riled up,\\" he said. After reviewing the emails, ABC shared them with the Bellevue police, who could not comment on them but believed they might be of some value to their case. The state's Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) removed Maile from Biryukova's home in the wake of her brother's disappearance and placed her into foster care. Solomon was granted twice- weekly visitation while petitioning the court hearing the divorce to grant him custody, which it did after removing the remaining protection order. The divorce was granted in January 2012. In 2015, on the case's fourth anniversary, Bellevue's new police chief Steve Mylett appealed publicly to Biryukova to talk to them again. \\"I am convinced you hold the key to finding Sky,\\" he said in a local newspaper. While the previous year the department said it had exhausted all the leads that had been reported to it, at that time Mylett claimed Solomon had shared some unspecified new information with them that might prove useful. Images of Sky that had been digitally age progressed to show how he might appear at that time were distributed along with the original photos. Biryukova's remarriage and third child Around the time of the fourth anniversary of the disappearance in 2015, it was reported that Biryukova had not only remarried the previous year but borne her third child by her new husband in July. DSHS workers were trying to have the infant removed from her care. In 2015, DSHS was most concerned about Biryukova's mental health, given her OCD diagnosis and past hospitalizations, following a complaint from the person who delivered the child. They also found the father, Alan Morgan, a convicted felon, problematic. Authorities in Florida had taken a child from his home there. The month the two were married Biryukova reported him to the police in Redmond for allegedly assaulting her and got a no-contact order; she nevertheless visited him regularly in jail in Issaquah, where he was when she gave birth, under assumed names. Both claimed to investigators they did not live together despite giving them the same address; Biryukova said at one point she did not even know who the father was, even though his name was on the child's birth certificate. In February 2019, Julia Morgan (formerly Biryukova) testified in court again, accusing Alan Morgan of violating a no-contact order. She acknowledged that she was not allowed to be alone with her new son without an observer present. Bellevue Police Spokesperson Seth Tyler said \\"We do believe she knows where Sky is.\\"https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/mother-of-sky-metalwala-still- wont-talk-to-bellevue-police-7-years-after-sons- disappearance/281-4f7f325a-f7ce-492a-811a-fa4f82f0641f She refused to talk to the press after the court appearance. Theories No trace of Sky was found in the surrounding neighborhoods. Police said they believed he did not wander away on his own. In the absence of any new information or useful leads, and with Biryukova's account still considered doubtful, theories of Sky's disappearance have assumed his mother's connivance. If he is alive, it is believed that either she let someone else take him that day, or earlier, with Sky's presence in the car an invention. \\"She concocted that hospital story and when she realized no-one believed it, she hired an attorney,\\" Leslie Clay Berry, Solomon's attorney told the Seattle Weekly in 2013. Solomon said he believed that his son was alive, but perhaps not in the U.S. In spring of 2011, after the visit to the doctor that was the last independent record of Sky's presence outside of Biryukova's household, he recalled that her estranged father came from Ukraine to visit her. He wondered to the Weekly if the older man could have taken the boy back to that country with him at the time. But in 2013, he said that he did not know how that could have happened. Berry, his attorney, said she believes more definitely that Sky was never in the car that morning, nor would police have been expected to find any evidence in the apartment. \\"She's a clean freak, and she probably bleached everything out,\\" she said to the newspaper, pointing to Biryukova's OCD. Unlike her client, she is doubtful about the outcome of the case. \\"I don't think he's alive,\\" she said in 2013. \\"Solomon doesn't like when I say that, but that's what I think.\\" While she believes Biryukova is responsible for his death, she allows that it could have been merely the result of negligence rather than a deliberate act of malice.

Short History Anorthosis (ŒëŒΩŒøœÅŒ∏œâœÉŒπœÉ) Women's volleyball team was established in the team's home town, Famagusta and was the first women's volleyball team on the island. After the Turkish invasion in Cyprus (1974), Famagusta's residents were forced to leave the city and spread to other Cyprus cities. Women's team recruited for a short term in Larnaca, but re-established strong foundations in 1987, in Nicosia, by Anorthosis' people who moved there after the war. The first members of the team were schoolgirls, but gradually the team grew and became competitive in the first division of women volleyball. Their first championship came in 2002, and in 2004 Anorthosis managed to win both the championship and National Cup. Since then, Anorthosis has been one of the top four teams of the Cyprus championship, and has won seven championships, seven National Cups and nine Super Cups.

He became a First Lieutenant Medical Officer following the United States's entry into World War I.  Early life and family  Before he changed his name to an American variation of Booker, William's family name was recorded as 'Booher'. His father, William John Booher, had emigrated from Togoland in German- controlled West Africa. William's paternal grandfather was a native of Togoland named Wilhelm Jacomenah Hesslebac Boohah. Booher's father emigrated to Canada before settling in America where he met Mary Ann Menafee. However, Booher died, leaving behind a wife and unborn child. William John Henry Booher was born on April 24, 1882, in Concord, New Hampshire. Wanting her son to be more familiar with the African-American community, Mary Ann Booher moved her son to the South. They started in Winter Park, Florida, where William noticed the alarming difference in schooling. But when William was fourteen, his mother passed away, leaving him, not only alone but destitute. Knowing that his mother had intended to move to Tuskegee, he packed his things. With the help of several friends, William got himself situated and found a string of odd jobs to make ends meet. He didn't quit school, though, which strained his time and his budget. He entered the Tuskegee Institute, founded by author, Booker T. Washington. Soon it became apparent that young William was on the brink of destitution as he would enter school wearing the most ragged and dirty clothes. This got the attention of Mrs. Booker T. Washington, who arranged for the boy to borrow clothes from a local store. Struggling to make ends meet, Booher was able to graduate from high school and college in 1902. While in Tuskegee Institute, he was awarded the Joseph Frye prize. Booker T. Washington, seeing the potential and dedication of the young man, offered a job to Booher at the school. Booher remained there for two years before entering Leonard Medical School. During medical school and the summer breaks, Booher used the tinsmithing he learned at Tuskegee to work on Pullman cars. While in college he was also very active in college athletics. Booher graduated from medical school in 1908 and earned his medical license in 1909 after being certified by the North Carolina Board of Medical Examinees. Instead of moving back to Alabama, Booher remained in North Carolina and opened his own medical practice in Oxford. Military service In 1917, the United States joined World War I and the entire nation was in a buzz to join the effort. After the declaration of war with Germany, many African-Americans were turned away from local recruiting stations. Unprepared for a large scale conflict, the United States Army had only four black regiments, and many commanders would not allow mixing of blacks and whites in their units. Also, the black regiments themselves were not trusted to be sent to Europe, as many of the higher ups possessed a lack of confidence in black soldiers as fighters. Fort Des Moines Provisional Army Officer Training School had been opened for training African-American men as there had been a huge influx of African-American volunteers and a petition was erected by the students of Howard University. However, there was still some discontent at the facility as many soldiers found that they were unfairly assessed for merely being black. Booher volunteered in 1917 and was ranked First Lieutenant in the Army Reserve Medical Corps. He reported to Des Moines, Iowa for training and when completed Booher was assigned to the 92nd Divisions 317th Sanitary Train at Camp Funston, Kansas. However, soon after beginning his work in Funston, Lieutenant Booher was honorably discharged in December 1917. He had been deemed physically unfit for duty and never sailed with the rest of his unit to France. Career Booher returned to his family in Oxford, North Carolina, and resumed work on his medical practice. During this period William Booher had renamed his family as 'Booker' and was from then on referred to as William Booker. Death Three years after returning from the war, William Booker died of apoplexy (cardiac stroke). Personal life On August 3, 1909, Booker had married Ida Mae Shaw, a native of Alabama. The couple had two children, Mary Louis and William John Henry Booher. After the death of her husband, Mrs. Booher moved her children to Atlanta, Georgia and became a school teacher. She never remarried. Her son William John Henry Booher went on to graduate from Morehouse College and is the Grandfather of William Jamel Booher.

(The CBI headquarters is on the opposite side of the road, not pictured.) Najeeb Ahmed was a first-year M.Sc. Biotechnology student at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, India, who went missing from his hostel on the university campus under suspicious circumstances on 15 October 2016. Disappearance Najeeb Ahmed was a newly enrolled student at JNU. He resided at the Mahi-Mandavi hostel on the university campus for less than a week before he disappeared. His family, as well as the JNU Students' Union, have consistently maintained that Ahmed's disappearance was linked to an assault on him which occurred the prior night. Ahmed was attacked by nine members of the ABVP after they had allegedly knocked on his door seeking votes for an upcoming hostel election. Subsequently, his family demanded that the proper investigative agencies look further into the assault and his disappearance. On 25 November 2016, Ahmed's mother, Fatima Nafees, filed a habeas corpus petition before the Delhi High Court, claiming that the Delhi Police had failed to make any progress in the month after her son's disappearance. Investigation  The Police filed a First Information Report (FIR) for kidnapping and wrongful confinement based on Fatima Nafees's complaint on 15 October 2016. Premier investigative agencies in India, including a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Delhi Police, the Crime Branch of the Delhi Police, and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), have been unable to find any leads. All of these agencies were reprimanded by the Delhi High Court at various points for their poorly executed investigation into the case. The Delhi police spent approximately 24,55,600 rupees (US$33,500) advertising Ahmed‚Äôs disappearance. After 25 days, the investigation was transferred to the Crime Branch. CCTV footage was found that led the investigators to identify the rickshaw that Ahmed reportedly took from the JNU campus.Inside story of the hunt for Najeeb Ahmed, the JNU student who disappeared into thin air, Ananya Bhardwaj and Kritika Sharma, The Print, 13 October 2018 The mobile phones of the nine ABVP members accused of assaulting Ahmed were sent by the CBI to the Forensic Science Laboratory in Chandigarh and 122 gigabytes of data were extracted from six of the phones. However, the data did not reveal any relevant information. On 29 June 2017, the CBI announced a reward of 1 million rupees (over US$13,500) for information about Najeeb Ahmed. CBI‚Äôs Rs 10 lakh reward for information on JNU student, Two Circles, 29 June 2017 In one of their submissions to the Delhi High Court, the CBI accused the Delhi Police of forcing a false statement from an auto driver who said that he had driven Ahmed to Jamia Milia Islamia on the day of his disappearance. The Delhi Police had used this fabricated evidence to pursue a theory that Najeeb had left the campus on his own volition. It had also used Ahmed's medical history to assert that he was mentally disturbed. After being unable to prove any connection between his medical condition and his disappearance, the Delhi Police quietly dropped this line of investigation.

It is located in the department of Cher in the Sologne region of France. The station consists of several instruments. Most iconic of these is the large decimetric radio telescope, which is one of the largest radio telescopes in the world. Long established are also the radio heliograph, a T-shaped array, and the decametric array operating at wavelengths between 3 m and 30 m.  History  Radio astronomy emerged after the Second World War, when experts and surplus equipment became available for civilian use. The √âcole Normale Superieure was given three 7.5 m diameter W√ºrzburg Riese that the British had seized from the Germans during the war. These were initially deployed at a research centre of the French navy at Marcoussis. One of the W√ºrzburg Riese antennas at Nan√ßay. It was recognised that radio astronomy required a large, flat and remote site to accommodate antennas spread over distances of 1.5-2 km or of considerable size, and to avoid unwanted radio waves from human technology. A 150 ha plot of woodland near Nan√ßay became available and was purchased in 1953. Initially, various small instruments - single dishes and interferometers - were installed. 6 m wide railway tracks, one running east‚Äìwest and one north‚Äìsouth were constructed, which would carry the equatorially mounted 40 t W√ºrzburg antennas. A predecessor to the current heliograph had 16 antennas of 5 m diameter spread equally along a 1500 m long east‚Äìwest baseline, while eight antennas of 6 m in diameter were aligned north‚Äìsouth. The frequency observed was 169 MHz (1.77 m wavelength). After the discovery of the 21 cm line in 1951 and the prospect of observing interstellar and extragalactic line emission and absorption, the need for more sensitive radio telescopes arose; their larger size would also deliver higher angular resolution. The plan for this \\"large radio telescope\\" was derived from a 1956 design by John D. Kraus. This design made possible a large collecting area and high resolution, with only moderate need for moving parts. Disadvantages were the restriction to the meridian and the asymmetric angular resolution that would be much coarser in altitude than in azimuth. The altitude control initially proved very difficult.  The large radio telescope  Layout of the large radio telescope. The primary mirror and focal cabin. The rear of the tilting primary mirror. The spherical secondary mirror. The movable focal cabin. The large radio telescope (in French: le Grand Radiot√©lescope, or affectionately le Grand Miroir) was constructed between 1960 and 1965. Initially, only the central 20% of the primary and secondary mirrors were erected as a proof of concept. The mirrors were extended to their full, current size in 1964 and the telescope was officially opened in 1965 by Charles de Gaulle. Scientific observations began in 1967. The large radio telescope is a transit telescope of the Kraus-type design. The primary mirror at the north end of the installation is a planar mirror measuring 200 m in width and 40 m in height. This is tiltable to adjust to the altitude of the observed object. It consists of five 20 m wide segments, each of 40 t mass. The radio waves are reflected horizontally into the secondary mirror 460 m to the South. The shape of the secondary is that of a segment of a sphere 300 m wide and 35 m high. The secondary reflects the radio waves back into its focal point 280 m to its North and about 60% the distance back to the primary. A cabin with further mirrors and the receiver is located at the focus. During an observation, the cabin is moved west to east to track the observed object for about an hour around its transit through the meridian. The primary and secondary mirrors are formed by metal wire mesh with holes of 12.5 mm. The reflecting surfaces are accurate to 4 mm, permitting use at wavelengths upwards of about 8 cm. The telescope is thus designed for decimeter waves, including the 21 cm spectral line of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) and the 18 cm spectral line of the OH radical. The radio wave detector is cooled to 20 K to reduce noise from the receiver and thereby to improve sensitivity to the celestial radiation. The large radio telescope observes at frequencies between 1.1 GHz and 3.5 GHz, continuum emission as well as spectral emission or absorption lines. The autocorrelator spectrometer can observe eight spectra at different frequencies with 1024 channels each and a spectral resolution of 0.3 kHz. The instrument is particularly suited to large statistical surveys and the monitoring of objects of variable brightness. Observational projects include: * 21 cm HI emission of galaxies to study their rotation, distance, clustering and movement. This includes galaxies obscured in visible light by the Milky Way, blue compact galaxies, galaxies of low surface brightness (in visible light), and active galactic nuclei. * Pulsars, including pulse timing, distance, and the interstellar medium on the lightpath to Earth. Nan√ßay is part of the European Pulsar Timing Array * Stellar envelopes, eruptive stars and red giants. * 18 cm OH emission and absorption in comets to determine their loss rate of water and gas.  The radio heliograph  Looking north along the radio heliograph. Looking east along the radio heliograph. The heliograph is a T-shaped interferometer made up of equatorially mounted antennas of several metres (mostly 5 m) diameter. 19 antennas are located on an east‚Äìwest baseline 3.2 km long, 25 antennas are on a north‚Äìsouth baseline 2.5 km long. The instrument observes the Sun seven hours a day to produce images of the corona in the frequency range 150 MHz to 450 MHz (wavelengths of 2 m to 0.67 m). The angular resolution is then similar to that of the naked eye in visible light. Up to 200 images per second can be taken. This allows the systematic study of the quiet corona, solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The Nan√ßay observations complement simultaneous observations by space probes in visible and ultraviolet light and in X rays.  The decametric array  The decametric array. The decametric array was constructed between 1974 and 1977. It consists of 144 spiral antennas, which are made from conducting cables spun in spiral curves around conical support structures. At their base the cones are 5 m in diameter and they are 9 m tall; they are inclined 20¬∞ to the South. The cones are spread over an area of about a hectare. Half the cones are coiled in the opposite sense than the other, permitting the distinction between left and right circularly polarised radio waves. In each polarisation the collecting area is about 3500 m2, equivalent to a 67 m diameter dish. The instrument is sensitive to wavelengths between 3 m and 30 m, which are the longest radio waves observable through the ionosphere. The instrument is not an interferometer, but a phased array. A single dish antenna for these long wavelengths would have to be infeasibly large. Further, a phased array can be re-pointed at a different direction of observation instantaneously by changing the electronic signal delays between the individual antennas. The angular resolution is about 7¬∞ by 14¬∞. The decametric array does not create images, but observes a single spectrum from the sky position observed and records its change with time. The two principal objects are the upper corona of the Sun and the magnetosphere of Jupiter, which have both been observed almost daily since 1977. The temporal changes of signals from the Sun and Jupiter are very rapid, so that at Nan√ßay very fast receivers have been developed for these observations. The Nan√ßay observations of Jupiter complement the results from space missions like Voyager and Galileo.  LOFAR and NenuFAR  LOFAR consists of about 50 antenna arrays, or \\"stations\\", throughout Europe. These are connected by high-speed Internet link to a computer in the Netherlands. It is optimised for 110 MHz to 250 MHz (2.7 m to 1.2 m), but still has modest performance at 30 MHz to 80 MHz (10 m to 3.7 m). Antennas of the NenuFAR core. NenuFAR (New Extension in Nan√ßay Upgrading LOFAR) is a very low-frequency phased arra optimised for the frequency range from 10 MHz to 85 MHz (30 m to 4 m). These are the longest radio waves not blocked by the ionosphere. Early science operations should begin in 2019. The main scientific objectives are: * detection and study of (magnetospheres of) exoplanets at radio wavelengths, * detection of the epoch of formation of the first stars and galaxies some 100 million years after the Big Bang, when the neutral atomic hydrogen was reionised, * the study of pulsars, including spectroscopy, across the Milky Way, at low frequencies. When complete, there will be 1938 antennas. Most will be in a core of 400 m diameter, but 114 antennas will be spread to up to 3 km distance. NenuFAR will be a triple instrument: * a radio telescope observing multiple positions simultaneously, * an autonomous radio imager, building radio images of 1¬∞ resolution in seconds and of 10' in hours, * a LOFAR \\"superstation\\", i.e. a large extension of the Nan√ßay LOFAR station allowing the combination of NenuFAR and LOFAR to make radio images of sub-arcsecond resolution.  Other instruments and collaborations  In recent years and decades, projects of astronomical observation have become international co-operations, due to the necessary pooling of expertise and funding. In some cases, telescopes also extend across multiple countries. As such, developments at Nan√ßay in the 21st century tend to be the provision of a site for parts of larger instruments, such as LOFAR, and contribution of expertise to international collaborations such as LOFAR and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).  EMBRACE  Located at Nan√ßay and Westerbork, EMBRACE (Electronic Multibeam Radio Astronomy Concept) is a prototype installation for phase 2 of the SKA. It is a phased array of 4608 antennas that operate between 900 MHy and 1500 MHz. These are sheltered in a 70 m2 radio dome. With multiple beams, several sky locations can be observed at the same time.  ORFEES  ORFEES (Observation Radiosp√©ctrale pour FEDOME et les Etudes des Eruptions Solaires) is a 5 m diameter antenna dedicated to space weather and prediction of solar flares. It observes the solar corona daily between 130 MHz and 1 GHz and can monitor the radio emission of the Sun in near real time.  CODALEMA  CODALEMA (Cosmic ray Detection Array with Logarithmic ElectroMagnetic Antennas) is a set of instruments to try and detect ultra-high energy cosmic rays, which cause cascades of particles in the atmosphere. These air showers generate very brief electromagnetic signals that are measured in a wide frequency band from 20 MHz to 200 MHz. An array of about 50 antennas is spread over a large area of the site.  Monitoring antenna  An antenna, situated above the treetops on a 22 m high mast, has been monitoring the radioelectric quality of the Nan√ßay site for 20 years. It allows to identify interference that affects the observations by the radio heliograph and the decametric array. The bands from 100 MHz to 4000 MHz are observed in their entirety and in multiple directions.  P√¥le des √âtoiles  The large radio telescope, a number of display panels about the observatory, and one or two of the heliograph antennas can be seen from the car park of the visitor centre P√¥le des √âtoiles. During opening times, the visitor centre offers a permanent exhibition about astronomy and the work of the observatory. Once daily there is also a planetarium show and a guided tour of the large radio telescope and the radio heliograph.

Early life in Scotland  Brisbane boronia, illustrated by Estelle Thomson, 1929 Estelle Comrie-Smith was born in 1894 in Glasgow, Scotland, daughter of photographer and artist, George Comrie-Smith and his wife Ethel (n√©e Thomson). Her parents were naturalists and inspired Estelle's interest through family holidays to the Scottish Highlands and the Lake District. She attended Calder House School at Seascale, Cumberland, England and later studied physical culture in Dartford, Kent, after which she taught physical culture and eurhythmics. In 1917 in Glasgow, she married her second cousin Aubrey Frederick Thomson (who renounced his former surname, von Stieglitz, in favour of his mother's maiden name Thomson on 6 December 1917), a surveyor, who was then serving in the Australian Imperial Forces during World War I.  Australian naturalist  In 1919, after her husband was released from his military service, the couple came to Australia where they established a farm, Wombo, at Eight Mile Plains in Queensland, where they raised chickens and crops until the venture failed in 1923. During this period, Thomson developed an appreciation of Australian wildflowers, resulting in her becoming an active member of the Queensland Naturalists' Club from the 1920s. Despite raising four children, she found the time to paint and draw for the club's wildflower shows. She was vice-president of the club in 1929‚Äì1930 and president in 1930‚Äì1931.

It comprises a social security, health, and pension funds. The labour market is highly regulated, and Luxembourg is a corporatist welfare state. Enrollment is mandatory in one of the welfare schemes for any employed person. Luxembourg's social security system is the Centre Commun de la Securite Sociale (CCSS). Both employees and employers make contributions to the fund at a rate of 25% of total salary, which cannot eclipse more than five times the minimum wage. Social spending accounts for 21.8% of GDP. Statistics Luxembourg scores highly in the Human Development Index, a measure that takes into account educational attainment, life expectancy, and per capita income. The country has a relatively low GINI coefficient, a measure of income inequality. The country's per capita income is $99,000 as of 2015, one of the highest in the world. It offers one of the highest replacement rates in the OECD owing in part to immigration. This has ensured a steady stream of contributors into the system. There are some strains on the system, such as high youth unemployment with 26.1% of males, and 18.1% of females between the ages of 15‚Äì24 not participating in the labor force. Luxembourg has a low birth rate with a fertility rate of 1.61 children born per woman. The number of contributors has steadily increased relative to the number of pensioners which is helping to ensure the system's long-term solvency. As of 2006, approximately 40% of the country's population are foreigners. Only one-third of the country's labor force are Luxembourgers, with the rest being foreigners residing in Luxembourg and those commuting from the neighboring countries of Germany, Belgium, and France. The second half of 2015 until present has seen an increase in the number of migrants seeking asylum. Compared to past years, the recent migrants tend to be less educated where as in previous years migrants on average have had higher levels of educational attainment than the general public. The labor-market participation rate of Women is low but increasing. With real GDP growth at 4.8% in 2015 and projected in 2016 to be above 3% Luxembourg is seeing growth substantially higher than the average in the OECD. There are concerns in the labor market, however, chiefly because the unemployment rate has increased from 2% to 7% between 2000‚Äì2014. Welfare programs The social welfare system comprises many benefits, namely maternity, illness, work- related accidents, pension, disability, basic minimum income, child and family benefits, survivors' insurance, early retirement, and long-term care insurance. The broad entitlement programs of Luxembourg's citizens are managed by the state. The pension scheme has multiple types of users: children (orphans), the disabled, surviving partners, and insured elderly. Since 2009, the National Insurance Fund has taken over activities of four pension funds from the general social welfare system scheme: the Old-age and Invalidity Retirement Fund, Retirement Fund for Skilled Workers, Retirement for Private Employees, and the Agricultural Retirement Fund. The childcare benefits give monthly payments to families depending on the number of children they have, and birth allowances allow three payments to women who have met the compulsory medical visits.

Launched in 2007, the webcomic completed its run in 2012 and got a Dark Horse Comics print publication in 2013. Sin Titulo won a Joe Shuster Award in 2009 and an Eisner Award in 2010. Content The webcomic Sin Titulo follows protagonist Alex Mackay, who, at the start of the story, discovers a photograph of an unfamiliar woman in his grandfather's possessions and feels compelled to hunt her down. This leads him to an underworld populated by mysterious and strange concepts, such as an eerie laboratory and a femme fatale. Lauren Davis of Comics Alliance described Sin Tutilo as a \\"noir fantasy\\": though it suggests the existence of science fiction concepts such as interdimentional travel and \\"shared cognitive space\\", many of its visuals are akin to those of a detective novel. Development Sin Titulo was launched by Cameron Stewart as a webcomic in 2007 and eventually finished in 2012. Stewart did the writing, illustrations, lettering, and coloring for the work all on his own. The webcomic started as an \\"exercise in improvisation\\", its ambiguous title Sin Titulo literally meaning \\"Without Title\\" in Spanish. Many ideas for the story coalesced halfway through, when Stewart got a stronger grasp of what the webcomic was about. In 2011, Sin Titulo went on hiatus for almost a full year, keeping its readers in suspense. Stewart told Davis of Comics Alliance at the New England Webcomics Weekend in 2009, when Sin Titulo was still fairly young, that the webcomic is inspired by a disquieting experience he had as a child; one he's never been able to explain. He told Davis that he did not want Sin Titulo to turn out like the television series Lost, which was still airing at the time and which disappointed him for not answering all of the questions it set up. Though Stewart did not intend for it to be an autobiographical work, many aspects of the webcomic are based on his own experiences, including the sudden death of a neglected grandfather. A strong influence of Sin Titulo is the work of David Lynch. In an interview with Newsarama, Stewart stated that he admires Lynch for his ability to provoke a sense of horror through surrealistic imagery that, to him, feels deeply honest. Stewart said that \\"I find his work so terrifying because on some primal level I feel like its revealing some dark and indescribable truth with complete sincerity.\\" This is a quality he attempted to emulate in his webcomic. On September 25, 2013, a print edition of Sin Titulo was released by Dark Horse Comics. Though the webcomic was still available for free online, the comic book compilation became a best-selling album. Reception Lauren Davis praised Sin Titulo in 2012 for how it weaved its story threads together at the end and for its \\"slightly disorienting\\" style, allowing its readers to experience Alex' trials alongside him. Hillary Brown of Paste Magazine noted that the webcomic's atmosphere and moments of fear provoke stronger emotions than the mechanics of its plot. Brown praised Stewart for his ability to capture the feeling of being unsure whether you're awake or asleep, but criticized the manner in which he set up and eventually resolves the mysteries in Sin Titulo, stating that \\"doesn‚Äôt quite do them justice.\\" Stewart won a Joe Shuster Award in 2009 in the category \\"Webcomics\\" for his work on Sin Titulo. The following year, Stewart won an Eisner Award in the \\"Best Webcomic\\" category.

The band went through several lineup changes with Husvik and Espevoll being the only two constants. Christer later left the band along with longtime guitarist Ole B√∏rud, who would later come back. The band disbanded in 2007, due to personal issues. During his time with Extol, he, his cousin, Tor Magne Glidje, John Robert Mjl√•nd, and Ole Halvard Sveen, all of the bands Extol, Lengsel, and Mantric, formed a side-project called Ganglion. Ganglion released two EPs, one as a seven-inch. The project became inactive, as did Extol. Espevoll stated that the band ended due to personal issues, for Espevoll, it was to spend time with his family. Extol reformed in 2012 with the lineup of Espevoll, Husvik, and B√∏rud. Espevoll stated the main reason to reunite the band was \\"to make the best music possible\\". During the band's hiatus, Espevoll spent some time in a Mental Facility, due to dealing with stress and anxiety. The band released their fifth self-titled album in 2013. Espevoll's brother and Extol founder Christer Espevoll was supposed to record on the album, but was unable to perform on the album.

She was noted for her progressive and feminist spirit in the years of the Transition. She was one of the first women to practice journalism in Spain, and she and Teresa Rubio were the first two female journalists for the Diario de Barcelona. In 1978 she was one of the founders of El Peri√≥dico de Catalunya. Biography Rivi√®re studied journalism at the Escuela de la Iglesia de Barcelona, and philosophy at the Universidad de la Ciudad Condal, in addition to design in Paris. Her first journalistic jobs were in the fashion world, as a Spanish correspondent for the French magazine Marie Claire, where she worked from 1965 to 1968. She next worked for the journal of economic monographs Dossier Mundo, from 1971 to 1974, of which she was editor-in-chief. After this she was head of the Culture section of Diario de Barcelona beginning in 1978, and head of the same section of El Peri√≥dico de Catalunya beginning in 1984. There she also directed the Sunday edition, and daily opinion columns. From 1988 to 1992 she was the director of the news agency EFE in Catalonia. In some of her interviews Rivi√®re recalled how there were no women's bathrooms on newspaper premises, requiring her to travel quite far to find one.

He was the son of the distinguished, Ubayd Allah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan, who served twice as vizier, under the caliphs al-Mutawakkil and al-Mu'tamid. The famous historian al- Tabari was his tutor, reportedly being paid ten gold dinars a month. A rival of Ali ibn al-Furat, he succeeded the latter as vizier to Caliph al-Muqtadir in July 912, and remained in office until August 913. His tenure was marked by attempts to shore up finances through imposing heavy fines to dismissed officials of the Banu'l-Furat faction, and by a pro-Hanbali stance that led to anti-Shi'ite measures. After his dismissal, he was imprisoned by his successor Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah, and by his rival Ibn al-Furat when the latter became again vizier in 917. He died in 924/5. His son Abdallah also served briefly as vizier in 924‚Äì925.
