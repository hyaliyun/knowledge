Its bishops are in apostolic succession through the Right Rev. A. Donald Davies (deceased). Davies was formerly the bishop-in-charge of the Convocation of American Churches in Europe and the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth, Texas. Bishop Archibald Donald Davies had, in 1970, been consecrated the fourth bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Dallas. Fifteen bishops of the Episcopal Church assisted at the consecration of Bishop Davies, with John Elbridge Hines as one of the principal consecrators. Bishop Hines had himself been consecrated the fifth bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Texas in 1945, and was later elected the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. In 1992, following years of controversy in the Episcopal Church in the USA and the Anglican Church of Canada over what conservative members considered a steady drift towards both political and religious liberalism, the Episcopal Missionary Church (EMC) was founded. Although this was fifteen years after the Congress of St. Louis at which Anglicans from the USA and Canada created the Continuing Anglican Movement in opposition to women's ordination, Prayer Book alterations, and more relaxed sexual standards approved in ECUSA, the EMC is usually considered a Continuing Church. Bishop Davies was elected its first presiding bishop. He was also elected Archbishop and Primate of the several parishes constituting the Christian Episcopal Church of Canada. A decade later, a split in the Episcopal Missionary Church's Diocese of the West produced the Christian Episcopal Church in the USA. Those who left the Diocese then appealed to Bishop Davies and joined with the churches in Canada. At one time, the XnEC in the United States counted parishes in Mississippi, South Carolina, California, Arizona, Texas and other states, but at present its parishes are two in Washington State and one in Florida. The current Archbishop and Primate is the Theodore C. Casimes. XnEC's Bishop Co-Adjutor is the Rt. Rev. Dr. Tim Klerekoper. Every bishop in the Christian Episcopal Church has had Archbishop Davies as one of his consecrators. All, therefore, can claim to have received valid episcopal orders through the bishops of the Church of England, and the Scottish Episcopal Church, but also from the Episcopal Church in the USA. The Christian Episcopal Church of Canada is headed by Robert David Redmile. In September 2017 it was announced by Archbishop Theodore Casimes that Gavin Ashenden had been consecrated as a missionary bishop in the United Kingdom and Europe by the Christian Episcopal Church. However, on the fourth Sunday of Advent 2019, Ashenden was received into the Roman Catholic Church by Bishop Mark Davies, the Bishop of Shrewsbury in Shrewsbury Cathedral. https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/anglican- bishop-and-queens-chaplain-converts-to-catholicism Bibliography *The Apostolic Succession and the Catholic Episcopate in the Christian Episcopal by Robert David Redmile, published by Xulon, 2006  pages 66,85-86 ReferencesExternal links *Official Christian Episcopal Church webpage Canada and USA jurisdictions Category:Christian organizations established in 2002 Category:Anglican denominations in North America Category:Continuing Anglican denominations Category:Anglican denominations established in the 21st century ","title":"Christian Episcopal Church"},{"id":"10850248","text":"Site and services is an approach to bringing shelter within the economic reach of the poor. History Recognizing that the vast majority of low income families in the world build their own shelter, which lacks basic hygiene, access and electricity, the strategy was developed. The approach first appeared on a large scale in Madras (now Chennai) in 1972 when the World Bank engaged Christopher Charles Benninger to advise the Madras Metropolitan Development Authority (MMDA) on their housing sector investments. The approach links the user group's ability to pay with land prices and the costs of rudimentary and upgradable infrastructure. The fundamental idea is to market plots with essential infrastructure at market prices, to avoid the resale of subsidized housing, directed at low-income groups. The first major scheme planned by Benninger, at Arambakkum in Chennai, created about 7,000 shelter units, within the paying capacity of the urban poor. Within five years the MMDA created more than 20,000 units and the approach became a major strategy of the World Bank to tackle a variety of shelter problems globally.

It is the oldest school in Sarawak, though the school was originally at St Mary's location back in 1848. The school is the fourth oldest in Malaysia. The students of St. Thomas are called Thomians regardless of gender. It is a government-aided Mission School. It is regarded as one of the best school in Sarawak in a wide range of fields. History=The Early Years (1848-1882) * The missionaries, led by a priest-doctor, Francis Thomas McDougall, arrived in Sarawak on 29 June 1848. * On 5 August, Francis Thomas McDougall opened a Day School for boys in an empty house in town. The Home School was set up when James Brooke asked the Mission to adopt four Eurasian children. * In September 1848, the Rajah granted land situated east of the town to the mission. The Home School moved there in 1849. The Home School was developed into the two familiar schools in Kuching - St. Thomas' for boys and St. Mary's for girls. * The Main Building was opened by the Rajah James Brooke on 13 August 1886. * The new Assembly Hall was opened and blessed on 30 November 1927. * Building of four Boarding Houses was declared open by Mr. Justice Boyd, the Judicial Commissioner on 10 September 1929. * Francis Hollis, later Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak, was Principal of the School from 1928-1938. * The Cambridge Junior Certificate examination was first taken in 1930, while in 1935, School Certificate examination was started. The Japanese Occupation (1941-1945) * On the last day of the term, 19 December 1941 Kuching was bombed by the Japanese Air Force. The Japanese Army Landed in Kuching on Christmas Eve and occupied the school compound on Christmas Day. * During 1941, three to four hundred forced labourers were housed in the school. A swimming pool was built but was never completed. * Several days before the Australians landed on 11 September 1945 the majority of the Japanese troops left Kuching and the school buildings were left empty. The school buildings including the Principal's House and offices were dismantled by labourers for firewood and for making wash bowls and furniture for sale. The Post War Years (1946-1962) * Within three weeks after the Japanese surrender, St. Thomas' School and St. Mary's School reopened as a co-ed school but by 9 January 1946 the two schools separated. * On 1 May 1947, the restored Main Building was formally opened by the then Governor of Sarawak, Sir Charles Arden Clarke. * The first post-war Cambridge Junior Certificate Examination was held in St. Mary's School Hall in 1947 and 21 candidates were successful. * The first edition of the annual school magazine \\"The Thomian\\" was produced in 1949. * The Old Thomian Association was formed in 1951 and Mr. E.W. Howell was elected president. * In early 1952, the school was separated into Primary and Secondary Departments. * St. Thomas' day was celebrated for the first time on 6 October 1954. * The first edition of the school paper \\"The Square\\" appeared in May 1955.

Mackinawite also occurs in reducing environments such as freshwater and marine sediments as a result of the metabolism of iron and sulfate- reducing bacteria. In anoxic environments, mackinawite is formed by the reaction of HS‚àí with either Fe2+ ions or with Fe metal. Mackinawite is a metastable mineral that occurs predominantly as a poorly crystalline precipitate. After the initiation of precipitation, mackinawite can take up to 2 years to form at 25 ¬∞C. It has been reported that mackinawite can be stable for up to 16 weeks at temperatures up to 100 ¬∞C at pH values from 3-12. Laboratories have also produced synthetic mackinawite to study its formation using several different methods such as reacting sulfide with metallic iron or a solution of ferrous iron, growing sulfide reducing bacteria using Fe2+, and Transformations in the environment Depending on the redox conditions mackinawite can form more stable phases such as greigiteCs√°kber√©nyi-Malasics, D., Rodriguez-Blanco, J.D., Kov√°cs Kis, V., Reƒçnik, A., Benning, L.G., and P√≥sfai, M. (2012) Structural properties and transformations of precipitated FeS. Chemical Geology, 294-295, 249-258. doi: 10.1016/j.chemgeo.2011.12.009. and ultimately pyrite, an important mineral in anoxic aqueous settings that is preserved in sedimentary deposits, especially black shale. While it has been determined that mackinawite is a necessary precursor to pyrite, the pathway of iron sulfide mineral formation from aqueous species to solid mineral is still nebulous. Many iron sulfide minerals may exist in the transition between poorly ordered mackinawite and crystalline pyrite such as greigite, smithite, and pyrrhotite; however, studies have also indicated that pyrite formation from mackinawite can occur where oxidation has commenced and the sulfur present is in intermediate oxidation states (-1 to +6) and intermediate sulfur species such as elemental sulfur or polysulfides and surface oxidized monosulfide species, such as oxidized mackinawite or greigite are present.

He built a house and a workshop, and began building cutters and wagons. By 1869 his workshop was too small, and he set up a carriage works at Enniskillen, Ontario. McLaughlin also taught Sunday school in the Presbyterian church there. In 1877, he moved his growing business to Oshawa to take advantage of available labour and railway access in the larger urban centre. He established the Oshawa Carriage Works, later known as McLaughlin Carriage. In 1878, he married Sarah Jane Parr; his first wife had died of consumption. His sons George William and Sam also became involved in the business (George later served as of GM Canada), but eldest son John James left to become a chemist, started a soft drink company in Toronto, and invented Canada Dry ginger ale.Arculus, Paul. Durant's Right Hand Man, Freisen Press, 2011. page 45. During the 1880s, McLaughlin designed a new type of steering gear for carriages; through a distributor, the company sold about 20,000 of these gears to other carriage companies.Petrie, Ray. Sam McLaughlin, Fitzhenry & Whiteside, 1975. pages 11-12. McLaughlin served on the board of health and board of water commissioners at Oshawa and also served as mayor. He was the first president of the local YMCA. After his carriage works was destroyed in a fire in 1899, he relocated to Gananoque but returned to Oshawa the following year, rebuilding the business with a loan from the city. In 1901, he married Eleanor McCulloch after the death of his second wife. In 1907, on the advice of his sons Sam and George, he set up the McLaughlin Motor Car Company to manufacture automobiles. McLaughlin supported tariffs restricting trade with the United States and opposed Sir Wilfrid Laurier's free trade proposals in 1910‚Äì11. In 1915, he sold off his carriage manufacturing business. In 1918, his companies were taken over by General Motors. McLaughlin died at Oshawa in 1921 of colon cancer. His brother James was a doctor and member of the Ontario assembly.

Biography  Darijan Bo≈æiƒç was born to Ivo and Ana Nu≈°a in Slavonski Brod (then Yugoslavia, today Croatia) as the younger of two children. When he was 7 years old, the family moved to Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, then a Yugoslav republic. He attended the Ljubljana Academy of Music, completing his studies with Lucijan Marija ≈†kerjanc (composition) in 1958 and with Danilo ≈†vara (conducting) in 1961. He joined the Pro Musica Viva group of composers in 1962, and won the Pre≈°ern Award of the Ljubljana Academy. Shortly thereafter, he became assistant conductor of the Slovene National Theatre Opera and Ballet Company in Ljubljana and from 1970 to 1974, was artistic director of Slovenian Philharmonic Orchestra. Between 1980 and 1995, he held a teaching position at the University of Ljubljana and the University of Maribor. In 1995, he became a manager and artist director of The Slovene National Theatre Opera and Ballet Ljubljana. He retired in 1998.  Works, musical style, and innovations  Bo≈æiƒç's music was strongly influenced by jazz and a keen sense of musical drama. His early concertos for trumpet, trombone and saxophone and his Sonatas in cool show clearly the jazz influence (similar to that on Tippett), and his use of extended tonality and traditional forms. From 1963 he adopted new methods, including a form of serial working and free rhythmic coordination, but with no loss of melodic interest. His frequent use of speakers is well illustrated by the collage tape work Trije dnevi Ane Frank ('Three days in the life of Anne Frank'), Polineikes and, above all, Jago, a musico-dramatic characterization derived from Shakespeare. Even in chamber works such as Kriki ('Screams') and Collage sonore, speakers are included in the ensemble. Although Bo≈æiƒç made only modest use of electronic sounds, he frequently used collage rather than musique concrete tape techniques, as in the bitterly ironical but magnificent reinterpretation of the funeral rite in his Requiem of 1969.

It is known from Mexico. It is similar to Xylophanes aristor but smaller and the forewing pattern is much more contrasted. It is distinguishable from most related species by the partial fusion and apical pinkish flush of the pale yellow spots of the median band of the hindwing upperside. The upperside of the abdomen has two narrow, pale lines, divided medially by a sharp, thin brown line of the same width. There is also a black basal patch and conspicuous longitudinal golden-yellow bands on either side of the anterior part of the abdomen. The first postmedian line on the forewing upperside is broad and very well-marked. The second is fused to the first. The interspaces between the first and third postmedian lines are very pale. The apical area on the forewing underside is pale buff on the costa, contrasting strongly with the orange-yellow ground colour. The median band of the hindwing upperside has pale yellow spots which are indistinct. The edges of these sports are suffused with orange-brown and in general, the three apical spots are more or less fused. Adults are probably on wing year-round. The larvae possibly feed on Psychotria panamensis, Psychotria nervosa and Pavonia guanacastensis.

Until September 2018, when John Manners took the record, Hutchinson's unique claim to fame was that, of all first-class cricketers around the world, he was the longest-lived whose age had been incontestably established. All but one of Hutchinson's 256 first-class matches were for Derbyshire. He was also selected for a Gentlemen v Players match at Blackpool in 1924, though neither team was of the strength usually sent out in the Lord's and Scarborough fixtures at this time, and the game was over in less than two days. It was, said Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, \\"a match by no means worthy of its high-sounding title\\".Wisden 1925 edition, Gentlemen v Players matches, Part II, page 442 Hutchinson never reached 1,000 runs in a season, his closest approach coming with 990 in 1928: he had been well on course at the end of July, having already passed 800, but his highest score in 16 innings thereafter was just 30. In other seasons, his run aggregate and average were often fairly modest, but he held his place in what was, admittedly, a consistently moderate batting side with his cover fielding, which was remarked upon year after year by Wisden. \\"There was no finer cover point in county cricket than Hutchinson,\\" it wrote in the 1929 edition.Wisden 1929 edition, Derbyshire report, Part II, page 303 His career best score was 143, made against Leicestershire at Chesterfield in 1924, the highest score of the season for Derbyshire, who failed to win a match all season and contrived to lose this one after being ahead by 52 on first innings by being bowled out for 69 in the second innings.Wisden 1925 edition, Derbyshire v Leicestershire, Part II, page 404 This remained his only hundred until 1927, when he scored two more, 110 against Glamorgan at Chesterfield and 102 against Gloucestershire at Gloucester, and enjoyed his best season in terms of averages, with 871 runs at 27.21. There was a fourth century in 1928, 111 against Warwickshire at Derby, and a final one the following season, 138 against Somerset at Burton-on-Trent, when he put on 153 for the seventh wicket with Archibald Slater and 113 for the eighth wicket with Arthur Richardson. In 1930, he played pretty regularly, but by this time batted mostly at No 7 or 8 and in the season he scored less than 500 runs. The following year, he played just nine matches and was not re-engaged at the end of the season. Hutchinson was born in New Tupton, Derbyshire. He died in Doncaster aged 103 years 344 days.

This is a list of the bird species recorded in Belize. Belize includes around 450 smaller cays and islands lying in the Caribbean Sea in addition to the mainland. The avifauna of Belize include a total of 608 species as of January 2020, according to Bird Checklists of the World. Of these, 91 are rare or accidental and four have been introduced. None are endemic to the country. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. Unless otherwise noted, the species on this list are considered to occur regularly in Belize as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The tags and notes of population status are from Bird Checklists of the World. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Belize * (I) Introduced - a species introduced to Belize as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Tinamous Order: TinamiformesFamily: Tinamidae Great tinamou The tinamous are one of the most ancient groups of bird. Although they look similar to other ground-dwelling birds like quail and grouse, they have no close relatives and are classified as a single family, Tinamidae, within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the ratites (order Struthioniformes), that includes the rheas, emus, and kiwis. * Great tinamou, Tinamus major (Near-threatened) * Little tinamou, Crypturellus soui * Slaty- breasted tinamou, Crypturellus boucardi * Thicket tinamou, Crypturellus cinnamomeus Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Blue-winged teal Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl such as geese and swans.

He also played for the Yorkshire Second XI from 1930 to 1937. Born in Sleights, near Whitby, Yorkshire, England, Richardson was a right-hand batsman, who scored 343 runs, with a best score of 61 against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), at an average of 31.18, and took four catches. He also scored 54 not out against Sussex. He took two wickets with his off breaks, at an average of 54.00, both scalps coming against the RAF. He was one of the most gifted amateurs ever to assist Yorkshire, and had he been able to spare time to play cricket regularly, he might have made a name for himself in the first-class game. Richardson was an auctioneer and farmer by profession. A tall, powerfully built batsman, with a penchant for the drive, he scored six consecutive centuries for Scarborough C.C. in 1938, and captained the club for twenty four years up to 1959. Having been in the first team for thirty two years, Richardson scored 18,900 runs for Scarborough, at an average of 45.99. He died in April 1985 in Scarborough, Yorkshire.

Etymology  Seri Bahlol may have came from the word Sahr or sehr which means \\"Sunrise\\" in Persian and Bahlol which means \\"Virtuous King\\". Therefore Sahr-i-Bahlol could mean \\"Sunrise of the Virtuous King\\". Bahlol is also a variant of the name Bahlul (meaning \\"one who smiles often\\") which is of Arabic origin. History Seri Bahlol is at the center of the Gandhara area. Seri Bahlol is a historical place and it has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage List since 1980.Unesco The ruins of Seri Bahlol are the remnants of a small ancient fortified town built during the Kushan period. The city was protected during the time of John Marshall. It contains the remains of Buddha, which have not been properly excavated. Antiques such as statues, coins, utensils and jewellery are commonly found.Hassan Dani, Dr: The Peshawar The local people continue illegal excavation in their homes and land, damaging the historical monuments. Some of the local dealers of antiques misguide the local population and instigate them to involve in illegal excavation. It requires national and international attention in order to reserve the remnants at Seri Bahlol. The word \\"Seri Bahlol\\" has been explained by various people in different ways. The local people, however, explains that this is a combination of two Hindi words \\"Sheri\\" means Sir and \\"Bahlol\\" the name of a prominent political and religious leader of the area. However, the name is not as old as the village Seri Bahlol. The village is located on a hillock protected by a well sophisticated stone wall which was constructed under the Kushans. The wall is damaged in several places, but it is still visible in many places. The village is surrounded by fertile land where local people practice agriculture. For the last few years, the rapid population growth has engulfed the agriculture land which is a risk for food security.

It is a service centre supporting both the local area and travellers passing through on the Barrier Highway. It lies south west of Broken Hill and north east of Peterborough. History Yanta was an early spelling. In 1866 the district was known as part of the Tattawappa and Yanta Run.Bailliere's South Australian Gazetteer, 1866, page 247. Yunta township was established in 1887 after the discovery of gold at the nearby diggings at Teetulpa and Waukaringa, when more than 5,000 miners made their way through here. In the early 1890s the village was a busy railway town on the Adelaide to Broken Hill line. From 1934 Yunta was the base for the famed outback trucking and mail contractor Harry Ding.http://adb.anu.edu. Today Yunta is a small service centre for travellers and the surrounding properties. Yunta also provides an alternate route to the Flinders Ranges and beyond. The natural gas fields at Gidgealpa and Moomba have resulted in improved access roads to South Australia's arid north-east region. Commercial area Village facilities include a hotel offering meals and accommodation, two roadhouses (one with caravan sites), two fuel stations, post office, Rural Transaction Centre offering internet access, police station, air strip and a primary school. A rest area with public toilets is located opposite the hotel. There was once a RV waste dump located between the railway line and the highway at the western end of town. Recently a commercial potable water dispensing system has been installed nearby. The main annual event is the Yunta Picnic Races and gymkhana held in May. Politics Yunta is located within the federal division of Grey, the state electoral district of Stuart and the Pastoral Unincorporated Area of South Australia. As of 2018, the community within Yunta received municipal services from a South Australian government agency, the Outback Communities Authority.

History  The foundation stone was placed on 27 August 1836, and the bridge was opened in 1837 (1840 according to Robertson). It was funded by Rev. Dr. George Morison (1758‚Äì1845), at a cost of ¬£1,400. Morison, son of Aberdeen Provost Robert Morison, was the minister at the Banchory-Devenick Parish Church from 1785, and inherited his elder brother Thomas' estate. He carried out work on behalf of his parishioners including arranging distribution of vaccines, supply of food during the 1800 famine, setting up a savings bank, and building a school. Morison proposed the bridge to link his church on the south bank of the Dee to 700 parishioners resident on the north bank, who were at the time crossing to the church by boat every Sunday. The bridge was designed by Aberdeen's City Architect John Smith, who had previously worked with Captain Samuel Brown on the Wellington Suspension Bridge in Aberdeen, who helped Thomas Telford design the Bridge of Don, and who designed the nearby Bridge of Dee. St. Devenick's Bridge was Smith's only solo suspension bridge design. The bridge spans 54.9 metres (180 feet) between stone piers and cast iron towers. The suspension chains comprise , cast-iron bars, anchored into stone anchor blocks. The southern anchor block is now in the middle of the river, which has changed course considerably since the bridge was built. The timber bridge deck and parapets were built by Morison's friend George Barclay. The lack of any significant metal stiffening of the bridge deck led to a flexibility which gave the bridge its popular name. The foundations and piers were built by George Donaldson, and the iron parts cast by George Duffus & Co. After Morison's death, the bridge was maintained by the Kirk Session. At present, it is unclear if any body has legal responsibility for the bridge. A newspaper headline in 1958 stated that it was The Bridge That Nobody Owns. Although its legal status remains unclear, Aberdeen City Council is currently active in considering the bridge's future.  Damage  The bridge was damaged by floods in 1876, 1914 and most seriously in October 1920, when floodwaters rose above the level of the bridge deck. Public funds were sought and the bridge reopened in September 1922. However, due to erosion, the Dee shifted its course from 1955 onwards, sweeping away the southern approach spans, and in 1984 the decking was removed as a safety precaution. The bridge is a Category B listed structure, and is now derelict.  Plans for restoration  In recent years (as of 2007) plans have been made to restore the bridge and extend it to the south bank. It was proposed to form a Trust to take on responsibility for the bridge. However, funding for restoration (estimated at ¬£775,000 in 1990) has not been secured.

The name \\"Tianjin Xingang\\" (), which strictly speaking refers only to the main seaport area, is sometimes used to refer to the whole port. The port is on the western shore of the Bohai Bay, centred on the estuary of the Haihe River, 170 km southeast of Beijing and 60 km east of Tianjin city. It is the largest man- made port in mainland China, and one of the largest in the world. It covers 121 square kilometers of land surface, with over 31.9 km of quay shoreline and 151 production berths at the end of 2010. Tianjin Port handled 500 million tonnes of cargo and 13 million TEU of containers in 2013, making it the world's fourth largest port by throughput tonnage and the ninth in container throughput. The port trades with more than 600 ports in 180 countries and territories around the world. It is served by over 115 regular container lines. run by 60 liner companies, including all the top 20 liners. Expansion in the last two decades has been enormous, going from 30 million tonnes of cargo and 490,000 TEU in 1993 to well beyond 400 million tonnes and 10 million TEU in 2012. Capacity is still increasing at a high rate, with 550‚Äì600 Mt of throughput capacity expected by 2015. The port is part of the Binhai New Area district of Tianjin Municipality, the main special economic zone of northern China, and it lies directly east of the TEDA. The Port of Tianjin is at the core of the ambitious development program of the BNA and, as part of that plan, the port aims to become the primary logistics and shipping hub of North China. On 12 August 2015, at least two explosions within 30 seconds of each other occurred at a container storage station at the Port of Tianjin in the Binhai New Area of Tianjin, China. The cause of the explosions was not immediately known, but initial reports pointed to an industrial accident. Chinese state media said that at least the initial blast was from unknown hazardous materials in shipping containers at a plant warehouse owned by Ruihai Logistics, a firm specializing in handling hazardous materials.  Location and layout  The Port of Tianjin is on the coast of Tianjin Municipality, in the former county of Tanggu, on the coast between the estuaries of the Haihe to the south and the New Yongding River to the north. To the west, the port borders the city of Tanggu (now the Urban Core of the Binhai New Area) and the TEDA. To the east, the port opens up to the Bohai Bay. Tianjin Port is divided into nine port areas: the three core (\\"Tianjin Xingang\\") areas of Beijiang, Nanjiang, and Dongjiang around the Xingang fairway; the Haihe area along the river; the Beitang port area around the Beitangkou estuary; the Dagukou port area in the estuary of the Haihe River; and three areas under construction (Hanggu, Gaoshaling, Nangang). Map of the Port of Tianjin and its Approaches  Geophysical setting  North Bulwark of Tianjin Port The coastal area of Tianjin municipality before development was dominated by mudflats, salt marshes (and salterns), and coastal shallows. This littoral zone is wide and slopes gently: The 0 m isobath (the intertidal flats) extends to 3‚Äì8 km from shore at a slope of 0.71‚Äì1.28%, the ‚àí5 m isobath extends 14‚Äì18 km from shore, and the ‚àí10 m isobath reaches 22‚Äì36 km from shore. These features make deep water navigation dependent on extensive dredging, and it means that land reclamation is a cost-effective option for construction. Tianjin Port is by necessity largely man-made through dredging and reclamation.  History  The lower course and estuary of the Haihe is the main stem of a large navigable basin, as well as the westernmost seashore of the North China Plain, and there have been major ports on the area at least since the late Eastern Han Dynasty. The river port at the junction of the Grand Canal served as both an inland port and seaport supplying the northeast border of Chinese states. Since 1153, it was the critical supply hub for what is now Beijing. However, it was not until after the conclusion of the Second Opium War in 1860 that the port of Tanggu became an important transshipment center, allowing oceangoing ships to lighter their cargoes to cross the very shallow sandbar barring the entrance to Haihe, the Taku Bar (Â§ßÊ≤ΩÂùù ‚Äî the name of this barrier was often used by foreign powers to refer to the entire port). After the Boxer Rebellion, the whole of Tanggu came under foreign occupation, and those foreign powers developed an extensive network of quays on the riverside. The capacity of the Tanggu and Tianjin river port was limited, and so the Japanese occupation forces started in 1940 the construction of the Tanggu Xingang seaport (later the Tianjin Xingang port) outside the river estuary. By the end of the war, the new port was incomplete, and damage during the Chinese Civil War left it unusable by the time of its capture in 1949. The Communists reconstructed the Tanggu New Port slowly. On 17 October 1952, it reopened for traffic. At the time, the main channel was dredged to 6 m depth, could handle ships of up to 7,000 DWT and had an annual throughput of only 800,000 tonnes ‚Äî less than 1/500 of present capacity. The port remained small throughout the Maoist era, although it pioneered the first container routes and dedicated container terminal in China. The export boom that followed the post-1979 Reform and Opening period put enormous pressure on the rickety port infrastructure of China. Congestion became serious enough to force reform by the central government: On 1 June 1984, the Port of Tianjin was transferred from direct control of the Ministry of Communications to a \\"dual\\" system of shared central and local control. Annual Throughput of the Port of Tianjin 1990‚Äì2011 Production then increased in leaps and bounds. In 1988 throughput passed the 20 million tonnes milestone, and in the ten years from 1993, annual throughput growth averaged 10 million tonnes every year. In December 2001, the port was the first port in north China to reach the 100 million tonnes mark. In 2004 it reached 200 million tonnes, in 2007 300 million tonnes and in 2010 400 million tonnes. The container handling capacity of the port increased from 0.4 million TEU in 1992, to 2.4 million TEU in 2002, 7.1 million TEU in 2007, and more than 10 million TEU in 2010. The structure of the port also changed. In 1992, Tianjin Port Storage and Transportation Company was made into a joint stock company under the full ownership of the Tianjin Port Bureau. In 1996, it was converted into the Tianjin Port Holdings Company (TPC) and listed in the Shanghai stock market. In 1997, Tianjin Development Holdings, which owned the container-handling assets of the Port, was listed in Hong Kong. Its port assets were later spun out as the Tianjin Port Development Company (TPD) and listed in the Hong Kong exchange in 2006. The PTA delayed corporatization to steer the passing of the 11th five-year development plan for the port. The transition was only completed on 3 June 2004, when the PTA became the last major Port Authority in China to become a corporation: the Tianjin Port (Group) Company (Â§©Ê¥•Ê∏Ø(ÈõÜÂõ¢)ÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏, or TPG by its English acronym). The financial tsunami of 2008 hit Chinese ports particularly hard, as they depended heavily on foreign trade flows. The Tianjin Port did better than average due to its diversification: While container business plummeted, bulk trade (in particular iron ore) remained strong. Nevertheless, the crisis hit profits hard, and it convinced the Tianjin government to reorganize and streamline the structure of the Port, which they did in 2009 by having TPD (the smaller operator, but one with the useful foreign registration and access to foreign capital markets) take over TPC. Simultaneously, ownership of TPD was transferred from Tianjin Development Holdings (a subsidiary of the Tianjin Ministry of Commerce) to TPG. By the time the merger was concluded, on 4 February 2010, all operations in the Tianjin Port had been consolidated under TPG. The Port of Tianjin was adversely affected by a large industrial-scale accident in August 2015. On August 12, a series of explosions took place at a port chemical storage facility in Binhai, causing 173 deaths and nearly 800 injuries. The blast had the equivalent of 800 metric tonnes of ammonium nitrate or a magnitude-2.9 earthquake, according to the China Earthquake Networks Center. Eight other people remain missing.  Port fairway  The Tianjin Xingang Fairway is divided into the Main Shipping Channel, the Chuanzhadong Channel, and the Northern Branch Channel. The Dagusha Channel and the Haihe river channel are separate fairways with slightly different regulations.  Anchorages  Tianjin Port has six main anchorage areas and two temporary anchorages. All anchorages are designated for all functions ‚Äî berth waiting, quarantine, inspection and pilotage ‚Äî and provide little shelter from weather or rough seas. Bottom hold is poor to very poor. Anchored vessels are advised to keep five cables of clearance, as anchor dragging is common (up to 5‚Äì10 NM in a day in winter, due to drifting ice).  Shiplocks and tidal barriers  A ship passing from the Haihe into the Xingang seaport through the Xingang Shiplock The Haihe river channel is separated from the sea channels by three structures: * The Xingang Shiplock () in the northern side of the estuary is the main shipping route into the Haihe area. * The Haihe Tidal Barrier (), built in 1958, and last refurbished in 1999, serves as a dam, flood control sluice and tide surge protection for the Haihe river mouth. * The Tanggu Fishing Boat Lock () is at the western end of the channel between Donggu and Lanjingdao Island. In 2011, the Fishing Boat Lock gates started to be rebuilt to allow for larger road traffic between Donggu and Lanjingdao. The Haihe Second Barrier from the east. The final hydraulic structure of the Tianjin Port is the Haihe Second Barrier () at Dongnigucun, in the Jinnan district. The Second Barrier is also an open-type sluice barrier, with 8 vertical-rising gates allowing an average flow of 1200 m3/s. The barrier, opened in July 1984, closes ship traffic upriver into Tianjin city proper, and its erection resulted in the abandonment of 29.3 km of navigable channel.  Port governance = State regulation and supervision  The Port of Tianjin falls under the supervisory and regulatory purview of the Tianjin Municipality People's Government. The 2004 incorporation of the Tianjin Port Authority into TPG formally divested the group of its role as Port Regulator, which passed to the Tianjin Transportation and Port Authority (Â§©Ê¥•Â∏Ç‰∫§ÈÄöËøêËæìÂíåÊ∏ØÂè£ÁÆ°ÁêÜÂ±Ä), formerly the Tianjin Transport Commission. The TTPA implements state policy on port work; drafts local policies, by-laws and regulations; and licenses, audits, and issues certifications to businesses operating in the port, in particular to ship terminals. The TTPA supervises and manages compliance to all laws and regulations regarding environmental protection, service compliance, pilotage, maintenance of port infrastructure and handling of dangerous goods and disinfection in all terminals and storage areas. The Tianjin Municipality People's Government Port Services Office (Â§©Ê¥•Â∏Ç‰∫∫Ê∞ëÊîøÂ∫úÂè£Â≤∏ÊúçÂä°ÂäûÂÖ¨ÂÆ§) was set up in May 2009 to streamline port operations, in particular customs and inspection clearance procedures. Tianjin Maritime Safety Bureau: Harbormaster powers for the Port of Tianjin are mostly vested on the Tianjin Maritime Safety Bureau (Â§©Ê¥•Êµ∑‰∫ãÂ±Ä), which is the local agency of the China Maritime Safety Administration. Maritime Law: The Port of Tianjin falls under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Maritime Court for all matters of national and international Maritime law, including all forms of maritime contracts, torts and offenses.  Inspection and clearance  Inbound ships, cargo and personnel require clearance by four main government bodies: China Customs for customs declaration, Border Inspection for migration formalities, China Inspection and Quarantine for quarantine and fumigation, and the MSA for ship and crew safety regulations. Obtaining clearance from these so-called \\"One Customs Three Inspections\\" (‰∏ÄÂÖ≥‰∏âÊ£Ä) used to be a protracted process, and one of the continued foci of port reform is to speed up the clearance procedures and reduce their (still significant) burden.  Port management  The new headquarters building for the Tianjin Port Group, next to the Yihang International Building. Tianjin Port Group (TPG) is both the main Port Operator and Port Landowner, and retains some of the old Port Authority's supervisory functions. TPG is the holding company and Ultimate Controlling Party for most of the Tianjin Port operating units, and its affiliates and subordinate units run most aspects of port operation. The Dagukou port area is (at present) run separately by the Tianjin Lingang Port Group Co. (Â§©Ê¥•‰∏¥Ê∏ØÊ∏ØÂä°ÈõÜÂõ¢ÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏), owned by the Tianjin Lingang Economic Area Administrative Committee (of which TPG is a part). TPG also serves as Port Landlord, providing basic municipal services (including roads, power, water and sewerage) and other services, extending from construction materials to printing services, to the port's tenant operators. In this role, TPG maintains quasi-municipal authority over port areas. Finally, as with all Chinese SOEs, the control and coordination role of the local Communist Party units is significant, as is the common cross-sharing of personnel among related units.  Traffic management and navigational safety = Area procedures and traffic rules  The VTS Tower houses the traffic control center for the Port and its approaches The Vessel Traffic Service Center (Â§©Ê¥•ËàπËà∂‰∫§ÈÄöÁÆ°ÁêÜ‰∏≠ÂøÉ) of the MSA provides traffic control, navigation assistance and local communication to all vessels in the Port's fairway, anchorages and berths. The VTS Center is located in an 88 m tall control tower at the eastern end of the Dongtudi (East Pier), and has two subordinate monitoring stations at Dongjiang and Lingang. Its control area extends 20 nautical miles (37 km) from the tower. Compliance with the VTSC's authority is mandatory, and all ships must maintain watch on its VHF channel (Ch. 9) while on the port area. On the Haihe, both VHF 09 and 71 must be on watch.pilot \\"stations\\" are teams specialized in a set of berths rather than distinct physical posts, as all three are located in the same building  Aids to navigation  The Tianjin Port's aids to navigation (AtoN) system is fairly dense, and growing rapidly. The MSA Beihai Navigational Security Center's Tianjin Aids to Navigation Office (ÂåóÊµ∑Ëà™Êµ∑‰øùÈöú‰∏≠ÂøÉÂ§©Ê¥•Ëà™Ê†áÂ§Ñ) is responsible for the maintenance of all navaids within the Tianjin area. In 2004, the AtoN office controlled 141 navaids in the Tianjin jurisdiction, including 3 lighthouses, 12 light beacons, 22 lead markers, 44 day beacons, 55 light buoys, 1 NDB station, 1 RBN/DGPS station, 3 radar transponders, 2 large AtoN ships, 2 small AtoN ships and 1 survey ship operating from two wharves. Main Channel buoy 44 and Petrochemical Terminal  Weather monitoring and reporting  While the Port directly operates a number of hydro-meteorological stations (including tide gauges), weather forecasting is primarily the responsibility of the Tianjin Binhai New Area Weather Warning Center (Â§©Ê¥•Â∏ÇÊª®Êµ∑Êñ∞Âå∫Ê∞îË±°È¢ÑË≠¶‰∏≠ÂøÉ), the local agency of the Tianjin Municipal Weather Bureau (Â§©Ê¥•Â∏ÇÊ∞îË±°Â±Ä). The Warning Center uses local (26 automatic weather stations in Binhai), national and satellite data to forecast marine and port weather.  Maritime communication  Tianjin Coastal Radio's Tanggu Station Tianjin Coastal Radio: The Beihai Navigational Security Center's Tianjin Communications and Information Center (ÂåóÊµ∑Ëà™Êµ∑‰øùÈöú‰∏≠ÂøÉÂ§©Ê¥•ÈÄö‰ø°‰∏≠ÂøÉ) runs the Tianjin Coastal Station (Â§©Ê¥•Êµ∑Â≤∏ÁîµÂè∞, Callsign: XSV; Call: Tianjin Radio; MMSI 004121100). The Station is in charge of the communication obligations of the Global Maritime Distress Safety System in the Port's jurisdiction, supports the SAR Center's communication needs, and supports the MSA's duties of coordination and communications.  SAR operations and emergency response  Maritime Rescue Coordination: The primary SAR coordination agency is the Tianjin Maritime Search and Rescue Center (Â§©Ê¥•Â∏ÇÊµ∑‰∏äÊêúÊïë‰∏≠ÂøÉ), with responsibility for coordinating all SAR activities in Port waters. Tianjin Search and Rescue Base. In the background is the CNOOC Bohai Oil Building A. The Tianjin Search and Rescue Base is one of the six rescue bases of the China Rescue and Salvage Beihai Bureau, which is the front-line rescue and salvage force of the Ministry of Transport. SAR Assets: Tianjin Rescue Base keeps three dynamic standby stations, normally with the following units: # Search and Rescue Base's Wharf: One Fast Rescue Boat (Huaying 387) and one rescue tug. # Dagukou Anchorage: One 1940 kW Rescue Ship (Beihaijiu 169) # Beihai 2nd Point (10 NM south of Caofeidian, 38¬∫50¬¥N / 118¬∫25¬¥E) : One 1940 kW Rescue Ship (Beihaijiu 115) Tianjin Port PSB Fire Services Detachment (Â§©Ê¥•Ê∏ØÂÖ¨ÂÆâÂ±ÄÊ∂àÈò≤ÊîØÈòü) holds the fire-fighting and fire prevention duties for both the land and water areas of the Port. Emergency Medical Assistance: The Tianjin Port Hospital (Â§©Ê¥•Ê∏ØÂè£ÂåªÈô¢) is the primary provider of emergency medical care in the port. It is a 314-bed comprehensive hospital, owned by TPG, that is specially licensed to deal with infectious disease outbreaks, quarantine and maritime accident trauma: its orthopedic trauma department is especially well ranked nationally. Pollution Control: Tianjin MSA is the Port's \\"National Operational Contact Point\\" pursuant to MARPOL, and must be contacted (VHF 9) in all incidents of shipborne harmful substance spills. The State Oceanic Administration has overlapping authority regarding spills and pollution, usually concentrated on oil platform and pipeline incidents.  Law enforcement  The maritime governance regime in China is peculiar in its multiplicity of actors and apparent duplication of labor. Five major agencies (MSA, SOA, CCG, FLEC, GAC), plus the local People's Police and other local units, divide maritime and coastal law enforcement, safety and administrative duties, with much overlap in formal remits. These agencies' responsibilities reflect the functional jurisdiction of their parent ministries, and their operational emphases fit those jurisdictions. Only the Coast Guard (Maritime Police) patrol vessels are armed gunboats, and the Guard has first line jurisdiction in gendarmerie missions such as terrorism, piracy and serious crimes.  People's Police units  The Tianjin Port PSB Floating Station, moored at the Passenger Terminal. The Tianjin Port Public Security Bureau (Â§©Ê¥•Ê∏ØÂÖ¨ÂÆâÂ±Ä) is one of the fourteen branch offices of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, with sub-bureau status. It is responsible for public order, law enforcement, criminal investigation, road traffic control, and fire safety and firefighting. Water Police: The Tianjin Port PSB has its own water police unit running its own patrol boats, which are berthed on a floating pontoon station (Â§©Ê¥•Ê∏ØÂÖ¨ÂÆâÂ±ÄÊ∞¥‰∏äÊ≤ªÂÆâÊ¥æÂá∫ÊâÄ) built on a converted floating crane, currently located on the K1 berth of the Tianjin Port Passenger Terminal. China Coast Guard cutter at the Xingang Shipyard Border Protection: the Public Security Border Troops (ÂÖ¨ÂÆâËæπÈò≤ÈÉ®Èòü) are a gendarmerie force under control of the MPS in charge of border protection and security. The border guards' local ground unit is the Binhai New Area Public Security Border Protection Detachment (Êª®Êµ∑Êñ∞Âå∫ÂÖ¨ÂÆâËæπÈò≤ÊîØÈòü). The Tianjin Customs Anti-Smuggling Bureau (Â§©Ê¥•Êµ∑ÂÖ≥ÁºâÁßÅÂ±Ä), usually called the Anti-Smuggling Police (Â§©Ê¥•Êµ∑ÂÖ≥ÁºâÁßÅË≠¶ÂØü) is a People's Police unit under the dual command of the MPS and the GAC. It is the main body engaged in control, prevention and investigation of customs fraud and duty evasion and smuggling (including cultural goods, drugs, dangerous materials, etc.).  Other law enforcement bodies  The law enforcement arms of the MSA are the Tianjin Maritime Public Security Bureau (Â§©Ê¥•Êµ∑‰∫ãÂÖ¨ÂÆâÂ±Ä) and the Tianjin MSA Law Enforcement Patrol Flotilla (Â§©Ê¥•Êµ∑‰∫ãÂ±ÄÂ∑°Êü•ÊâßÊ≥ïÊîØÈòü). The Tianjin Maritime PSB (not to be confused with the Tianjin Port Public Security Bureau) is responsible for maritime law enforcement and carries out marine accident and criminal investigations. The Patrol Flotilla deploys eleven patrol ships (hull numbers haixun 05xx), which monitor and manage shipping traffic, maintain navigational order and safety, and cooperate on patrol, escort, and search and rescue missions as needed. The Second Detachment of China Maritime Surveillance (‰∏≠ÂõΩÊµ∑ÁõëÁ¨¨‰∫åÊîØÈòü) of the Tianjin Oceanic Administration has jurisdiction over the Bohai and Laizhou Bays, and over all the coastal areas of Tianjin and Hebei. It monitors environmental damage, illegal use of sea resources, violation of maritime regulations, and damage to marine facilities. The Tianjin Fisheries Management and Fishing Port Supervision and Management Office (Â§©Ê¥•Â∏ÇÊ∏îÊîøÊ∏îÊ∏ØÁõëÁù£ÁÆ°ÁêÜÂ§Ñ) is a branch of the Tianjin Fisheries Bureau under the China Fisheries Law Enforcement Command Center (‰∏≠ÂõΩÊ∏îÊîøÊåáÊå•‰∏≠ÂøÉ). It is in charge of enforcing fishing regulations, of controlling illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU), and of fishing navigational safety.  Business structure = Ownership structure  The ownership structure of the Tianjin Port after the 2009 merger. Green boxes are foreign-registered entities, blue boxes are mainland- registered The Port of Tianjin is a state-owned enterprise (SOE), run as an independent corporation, with separate finances and a commercial orientation. The Port Owner is the Tianjin Municipality People's Government (Â§©Ê¥•Â∏Ç‰∫∫Ê∞ëÊîø), through the Tianjin SASAC (Tianjin State Assets Supervision and Administration Committee‚ÄîÂ§©Ê¥•ÂõΩÊúâËµÑ‰∫ßÁõëÁù£ÁÆ°ÁêÜÂßîÂëò‰ºö), which is the full owner of the Tianjin Port (Group) Company (TPG). TPG's board is appointed by the Tianjin government. TPG is the effective holding company and main Port Operator, and it owns or has a stake on the majority of the Port's various operating outfits. Since the 2009 merger, TPG's main operating subsidiary is Tianjin Port Development Co. Ltd (TPD), which in turn is the majority shareholder of Tianjin Port Holdings Co. Ltd (TPC). TPG has been injecting operational assets to TPC for several years, and since 2009 to TPD (most recently the Shihua Crude Oil Terminal). This has created somewhat of a functional division. The listed TPD, directly or through TPC, controls all terminals and direct cargo-handling operations. TPG still directly controls most of the utility, support and ancillary units related to the Port, and retains control of strategic planning. TPG is also directly or indirectly a party in 53 joint ventures Tianjin Port Planning Map for 2030  Port operations  The subsidiaries and partial-ownership partners of TPG are involved in all facets of port operation, including stevedoring, shipping agency, cargo handling, storage and transportation, infrastructure management, communications and information services, financial services, power supply, real estate development, health care, personnel training, education, port security, transportation, fire protection, port facilities management, environmental management, etc. The core activity of the Port is, naturally, cargo handling and processing. As a comprehensive port, it handles all sort of cargoes, including dry and liquid bulk, general cargo, containers, vehicles, and passengers. Tianjin Port operates 365 days a year, 24 hours a day (on three shifts at 00:00‚Äì08:00, 08:00‚Äì16:00 and 16:00‚Äì24:00).  Port production  Docking terminals and wharves: As of 2011, the Port had 217 berths (including service berths); 90 berths were capable of accommodating ships over 10,000 DWT. Of these, 72 could dock ships over 50,000 DWT; 30 over 100,000 DWT, 23 over 150,000 DWT, 5 over 200,000 DWT, and 2 over 300,000 DWT. The Port's docking terminals are operated by autonomous companies that are mostly either fully owned by, or are joint ventures with, TPC or TPD. While the 2004 Port Law allowed full foreign ownership of port facilities, TPG is still the majority shareholder of all but a few of the Port's main terminals, excepting single-company (customs type II) terminals. Additional stevedoring personnel is provided by a number of labor services companies affiliated to various operators. Secondary wharves tend to the service, supply and maintenance ships that a complex port needs to function. These facilities range from temporary sand unloading wharves, needed for construction, to large bunkering wharves, workboat stations and the bases of the various law enforcement agencies. Scheduling and Dispatching: The Tianjin Port Group's Operations Department (Â§©Ê¥•Ê∏ØÈõÜÂõ¢‰∏öÂä°ÈÉ®) is in charge of coordinating the productive operation of the Port, and must be informed of all ship movements and major operations. The production schedule (ship movement plan) is arranged by the TPG Dispatch Control Center (Â§©Ê¥•Ê∏ØÈõÜÂõ¢Áîü‰∫ßË∞ÉÂ∫¶Êåá‰∏≠ÂøÉ), in coordination with the wharf operators, the MSA, and the pilot center. The Dispatch Center organizes ship movements, tracks pilotage operations, and supervises terminal operations via real-time CCTV monitoring. The Dagukou port area has a separate dispatching center (Â§©Ê¥•‰∏¥Ê∏ØÁªèÊµéÂå∫ËàπËà∂Ë∞ÉÂ∫¶ÊåáÊå•‰∏≠ÂøÉ). Two harbor tugs at the First Pier Tug Wharf Harbor Craft: The main provider of harbor craft is the Tianjin Port Tug & Lighter Company. The TTLC operates the harbor tugs, fireboats, pilot boats and other ancillary craft such as the crew boat Xinbinhai, or the sightseeing boat Xinhaimen (used for inspection and visiting VIPs). The company operates 26 harbor tugs (between 2,600 HP and 6,000 HP of power), 5 pilot ships, 7 other ancillary crafts, 2 floating cranes (120 t and 200 t capacity); and around three dozen lighters, the largest around 1,340 t displacement. The Dagusha channel is served by a subsidiary company of TTLC, the Tianjin Lingang Tug Company (Â§©Ê¥•‰∏¥Ê∏ØÊãñËΩÆÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏), operating four tugboats. Other work vessels: CNOOC Bohai Oil maintains a flotilla of 110 offshore support vessels (OSV), many homeported at Tianjin. These boats are available for emergency work under MSA authority. Two of CNOOC's floating cranes (800 tonnes and 500 tonnes) can be commercially engaged for harbor duty.  Port maintenance and construction  Facilities management: TPG operates as the port landlord, and provides most utilities, municipal services and ancillary services to the various port operators. The services it provides are very wide in scope, spanning everything from electrical power, to construction materials, to printing services. The main organ of TPG's landlord function is the Tianjin Port Facilities Management Company (Â§©Ê¥•Ê∏ØËÆæÊñΩÁÆ°ÁêÜÊúçÂä°ÂÖ¨Âè∏), which manages and maintains all municipal services ‚Äî including roads, railroads, bridges, water, and sewerage ‚Äî installs and maintains wharf equipment and other production material, provides municipal administration, and provides engineering consultancy services. Hydrographic Surveying and Charting: As an artificial port dependent on dredged channels susceptible to silting, continuous depth surveying is critical to the Port. Tianjin Port is the base of the Beihai Navigational Security Center's Tianjin Marine Survey and Charting Center (ÂåóÊµ∑Ëà™Êµ∑‰øùÈöú‰∏≠ÂøÉÂ§©Ê¥•Êµ∑‰∫ãÊµãÁªò‰∏≠ÂøÉ) with responsibility for the hydrographic surveying, monitoring, fairway sounding and charting of all waters and shipping channels in the Beihai (Northern Seas) area, which includes the Bohai and Yellow seas. As of 2011, the Hydrographic Brigade had 149 personnel, two survey ships (Haice 051 and Haice 0502), surveying equipment including ROVs, and UAVs for aerial surveying Channel maintenance: The Tianjin Dredging Company (Â§©Ê¥•Ëà™ÈÅìÂ±Ä) is the organic waterway management company of the Tianjin Port Group. As of January 2010, the TDC deployed 100 boats, and had the largest dredging capacity of China, with a capacity of 300 million cubic meters and more than 500,000 kW of vessel power. Despite these numbers, the scale of fairway expansion and land reclamation in the Port means that several other construction companies operate large numbers of dredging vessels as well. Dredging the Haihe Channel is the responsibility of the Tianjin Municipal Water Management Bureau (Â§©Ê¥•Â∏ÇÊ∞¥Âä°Â±Ä), which maintains both navigability and river flow capacity (set at 800 m3/s). The Water Management dredgers operate from wharves at the Haihe Second Barrier and at the Haihe Tidal Barrier. Icebreaking: Routine icebreaking is usually handled by the Tug & Lighter Company. In case of ice emergencies, the MSA coordinates icebreaking patrols, using heavy harbor tugs and dredges. During the frozen winter of 2010‚Äì11, the Port authorities estimated that there were 16 ships with icebreaking capabilities available, 10 of which belonged to the TTLC. CNOOC Bohai had 24 icebreakers, needed to clear offshore platforms, and also lent two larger icebreakers to the Port. Port Construction: The Port's main construction and engineering outfit is CCCC First Harbor Engineering (‰∏≠‰∫§Á¨¨‰∏ÄËà™Âä°Â∑•Á®ãÂ±ÄÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏). Four subsidiary companies carry out all forms of project engineering and construction, from roads to breakwaters. As of 2010, First Harbor Engineering First Company (the main boat outfit) had a fleet of 74 work vessels. As in the case of dredgers, the sheer scale of construction in the Port means that many other outfits deploy hundreds of vessels. As of 2008, there were 418 construction vessels operating at the Port, including 236 sand barges and fluvial workboats. The Tianjin Research Institute for Water Transport Engineering is in charge of the technical supervision of most port engineering projects. Real Estate Development: Commercial and residential property development in newly reclaimed or repurposed land is one of the four core \\"industries\\" of the Port. The Tianjin Port Real Estate Development Company (Â§©Ê¥•Ê∏ØÂú∞‰∫ßÂèëÂ±ïÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏), founded 2009, is now very active in developing both residential and commercial property on Port land.  Services and amenities  A water tender and a bunker tender resupplying a freighter at the First Stevedoring Co. wharf. Bunkerage: The main bunker oil, lubricants and water provider in Tianjin Port is Tianjin Chimbusco (‰∏≠ÂõΩËàπËà∂ÁáÉÊñô‰æõÂ∫îÂ§©Ê¥•ÂÖ¨Âè∏). Chimbusco China had a monopoly on the supply of bonded bunker oil (i.e. for foreign vessels) in China until 2006. Tianjin Chimbusco (now a TPG subsidiary) retained its exclusive rights in Tianjin until 2009, and the end of the monopoly resulted in a black gold rush of competing bunkerage companies: Sinopec Zhoushan entered the Tianjin market in October 2010, followed in December 2010 by SinoBunker, and in June 2011, by China Changjiang Bunker. This sudden rise in competition resulted in a serious price war and crashing prices in 2011. Most forms of maritime fuels are available, primarily IFO 180 cSt and 380 cSt; IFO 120 cSt, MDG, MDO and other diesels are available. Bunkering operations are done by fuel tender, as most berths do not have fueling equipment. Equally, drinking water is mostly delivered by tender. Chandlery and Supplies: Several dozen ship chandlers are capable of supplying all necessary deck, engine and cabin stores, and all other provisions both at berth or at anchorage. The oldest international chandler is Tianjin Ocean Shipping Supply company (Â§©Ê¥•Â∏ÇÂ§ñËΩÆ‰æõÂ∫îÂÖ¨Âè∏), owned by the Tianjin government. Most spare parts are available locally, and special orders can be flown in easily. Cleaning and Sanitation Services: Bilge, slops and ballast water disposal is a major pollution hazard for the Bohai Bay, and it is tightly regulated by the MSA. Only specially authorized enterprises can engage in their removal and disposal, or in tank cleanup. Nevertheless, illegal dumping of ballast water is a persistent problem and one of the Port's major law enforcement challenges. Ships carrying oil or liquid chemicals, and all ships over 10,000 gt are required to sign an \\"Agreement for Ship Pollution Response\\" with one of four authorized emergency spill response companies. Tianjin Port Harbor Service Company (Â§©Ê¥•Ê∏ØÊ∏ØÂè£ÊúçÂä°ÂÖ¨Âè∏) is the Group's organic \\"housekeeping\\" service, providing cabin, hold and bedding clean-up, and garbage disposal for ships at berth. Other companies are available for all sorts of cleaning, disinfection and deck maintenance, fifteen companies are authorized for ship garbage collection. Seafarers: As the port of a major city, facilities available to crews on shore leave are extensive, if somewhat difficult to reach. The International Seamen's Club (Â§©Ê¥•Êñ∞Ê∏ØÂõΩÈôÖÊµ∑Âëò‰ø±‰πêÈÉ®) is located at Xingang Liumi Road, opposite the Bomesc shipyard. Around two dozen crew management companies provide replacement crews at all times.  Ship repair and shipbuilding facilities  A ship under construction at the Bomesc Fabrication Site Tianjin Port has several ship repair and shipbuilding facilities capable of carrying out almost all forms of ship repair and refitting for all but the largest ships, and those capabilities are increasing rapidly. The Tanggu port area was one of the earliest modern shipbuilding areas of China. The still-functioning Taku Dockyard (now the Tianjin City Shipyard) was founded in 1880, and is the oldest modern dockyard in Northern China. Many small shipyards operated in the Haihe region, but most have closed in recent years, or will soon close to make way for the large development projects of the Binhai Urban Core. The main ship repair facility in the port is the CSIC Tianjin Xingang Shipyard. Founded in 1939, it is located at the very end of the main harbor basin, right next to the Haihe shiplock. Immediately next to it is the CCCC Bomesc Maritime Industry's facility (built in 2007). On the Nanjiang region, Singapore's Sembawang Shipyard entered in 1997 to the first foreign joint shipyard project in China, in partnership with Bohai Oil. That shipyard is now the CNOOC Bohai Oil BOHIC subsidiary. A large number of ship repair companies offer maintenance services at berth, and the Tianjin Wuzhou Marine Service Engineering Co. (Â§©Ê¥•‰∫îÊ¥≤Êµ∑‰∫ãÂ∑•Á®ãÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏) offers anchorage and under-way repairs using its specialized ship Jinyuanhangxiu 1 (Ê¥•ËøúËà™‰øÆ1Âè∑), one of only five such vessels in China.  Trade and shipping services  One of the strategic goals of the Port is to increase its high value-added services business, providing advance support for all forms of logistic activities. The Tianjin International Trade and Shipping Service District (Â§©Ê¥• ‰∏éËà™ËøêÊúçÂä°Âå∫) The Service District is composed of nine high-rise buildings, including the TPG main office building and the International Shipping Service Center. The Tianjin Port International Trade and Shipping Service Center. The Tianjin International Trade and Shipping Service Center (Â§©Ê¥•ÂõΩÈôÖË¥∏Êòì‰∏éËà™ËøêÊúçÂä°‰∏≠ÂøÉ) provides \\"one- stop\\" service for all sorts of aspects of shipping and trade, with a core mission of centralizing and streamlining the clearance process. The Center aggregates 270 government service windows from 14 government agencies, including customs, inspection and quarantine, maritime safety, border control, traffic control, maritime court, electronic customs clearance, business taxes, and state audit and supervision. The Dongjiang shipping services area is still under development, and aims to form a cluster of specific shipping services. Taking advantage of its favorable tax and currency exchange regime, the Dongjiang Bonded Port intends to attract a cluster of enterprises related to the financing of ship leasing and shipbroking, and to other forms of shipping financing, including offshore financial services, offshore banking, marine insurers and P&I; clubs, ship registration, local offices of the leading classification societies, etc. Shipping Agencies: Engaging a shipping agent is mandatory for all foreign flagged ships, and Tianjin has several dozen such outfits operating at present. The largest agents are Tianjin Penavico (Â§©Ê¥•Â§ñËΩÆ‰ª£ÁêÜÂÖ¨Âè∏), owned by TPG, and Tianjin Sinoagent (Â§©Ê¥•ËàπÂä°‰ª£ÁêÜÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏), a subsidiary of Tianjin Sinotrans. Agencies have fairly extensive obligations as intermediaries for most paperwork procedures involving TPG, ship operators, or government agencies, as well as their traditional duties of arranging ship supply and cargo handling.  Passenger services = Passenger terminals  The Tianjin Xingang Passenger Terminal The Tianjin Xingang Passenger Terminal (Â§©Ê¥•Êñ∞Ê∏ØÂÆ¢ËøêÁ´ô) is run by the Tianjin Passenger Company, and provides ferry services and coastal cruises. Two main regular ferry lines and one summer-only ferry line leave Tianjin, serviced by a fleet of three Ro-Ro ferry boats. There are two international destinations, Kobe in Japan and Incheon in South Korea, and one national destination, Dalian in Liaoning Province. Tianjin Cruise Homeport The new Tianjin Cruise Homeport started operation in the summer of 2010. It is located in the southern tip of the Dongjiang peninsula. The all-services terminal building is a large white GFRC-clad building designed to mimic the flow of white silk on an ocean breeze. It has an annual capacity of 500,000 passengers. At present, the Homeport has two berths capable of accommodating ships up to 220,000 gt ‚Äîenough to receive even the largest current cruisers.  Leisure services  Yachting marinas: There are three large-scale marina projects underway at the Tianjin Port to expand yachting services. # The Binhai Ocean One Yachting Club (Êª®Êµ∑‰∏ÄÊ¥ãÊ∏∏Ëâá‰ºö) is being built at the southern end of the Dongjiang Scenic Area's artificial beach. It is planned to become a yachting port with 700 berths, plus an extra 200 pile mooring slots. # The Sino-Australia Royal Yacht City (‰∏≠Êæ≥ÁöáÂÆ∂Ê∏∏ËâáÂüé) is a 1,000-berth development (to be completed in 2012) in the Tianjin Central Fishing Port. # The Hi-speed Tianjin Yacht City (Êµ∑ÊñØÊØîÂ§©Ê¥•Ê∏∏ËâáÂüé) in the Binhai Tourist Area plans to add 3,000 berths, focusing on high-speed boats, sailboats and high-performance yachts. Sightseeing tours: Two companies offer short (30-45min) boat tours of the harbor, traveling to the end of the Chuanzhadong channel. The first, Tianjin Port Haiyi Travel Service Company (Â§©Ê¥•Ê∏ØÊµ∑È¢êÊóÖË°åÁ§æÂÖ¨Âè∏), a TPG subsidiary, runs the sightseeing boat Haiyi (Êµ∑È¢êÂè∑) from the K1 berth of the Passenger Terminal, with capacity for 132 passengers ( as of November 2011). The second, Tianjin Haihe Jinlu Sightseeing Boats Company (Â§©Ê¥•Êµ∑Ê≤≥Ê¥•ÊóÖÊ∏∏ËàπÂÖ¨Âè∏) operates from the Sightseeing Boats Pier at the other side of the main basin. It runs two ships, the Haijing (Êµ∑ÊôØÂè∑) with capacity for 150 passengers and the Jinhai (Ê¥•Êµ∑Âè∑) with capacity for 184 passengers. as of April 2011.  Transportation and logistics  Storage, transportation and all forms of logistics processing are the core activity of the Port, and it is no surprise that the majority of its land surface is dedicated to storage and processing facilities, with several million km2 of storage yards, warehouses and tank farms operated by dozens of enterprises. There are two large-scale purpose-built logistics areas designed to provide support and facilities to the operating logistics outfits. The chief logistics unit of the Port Group is Tianjin Logistics Development Co. , established in 2009 by merging the Tianjin Port Storage and Distribution Company (Â§©Ê¥•Ê∏ØË¥ßËøêÂÖ¨Âè∏) with other Group logistics assets.http://www.tjbhnews.com/bhsh/system/2009/04/09/010024927.shtml TLD runs 1,800,000 m2 of storage yard, with a capacity for 32,000 TEU of containers, and is responsible for the establishment and management of the dry port network and the establishment of intermodal routes, as well as being the principal drayage provider.  Transportation corridors  China MSA's seaways plan for the Bohai Sea. Planned routes follow closely the seaways currently in use. Sea routes: Two main sea routes connect the Bohai Bay with the Yellow Sea and the open ocean. These two routes carry the large majority of all traffic in and out of the Bohai Sea, and can be very crowded. The main deep-water route (6 nmi wide) goes from the Laotieshan Channel (38¬∞36.1‚Ä≤ N, 120¬∞51.3‚Ä≤ E) at a 276¬∞ bearing until reaching a Traffic Separation Scheme south of Caofeidian (38¬∞48.0‚Ä≤ N/118¬∞45.2‚Ä≤ E), and can be quite a crowded waterway. A second main route (3 NM wide westward, 3 NM wide eastward) goes westward from Changshan channel (38¬∞05.0‚Ä≤ N/120¬∞24.6‚Ä≤ E) at a 293.5¬∞ bearing up to a point north of oil platform BZ28-1 (38¬∞21.0‚Ä≤ N/119¬∞38.5‚Ä≤ E), continuing at a 291¬∞ bearing up to the south of Caofedian Head (38¬∞38.7‚Ä≤ N/118¬∞38.4‚Ä≤ E) and then into the Xingang Main Channel. Internal waterways: The three main port areas are fairly poorly connected by road, requiring rather long detours to transport any cargo or equipment between them. While several bridges and tunnels directly linking Dongjiang with Beijiang and Nanjiang areas are projected for future development, these are still in early planning stages. To help relieve this internal bottleneck, in April 2010 the Port introduced a lighter route connecting Nanjiang (N-10 berth) and Beijiang (Tianjin Container Terminal), using one heavy barge (7800 DWT, 200 TEU). Another regular lighter route connecting Beijiang with Dongjiang was established in September 2010. Internal port railroad approaching the Fourth Stevedoring Company wharf on the Beijiang Third Pier Railroads: Two main lines (First and Second Port Railroads: ËøõÊ∏Ø‰∏Ä‰∫åÁ∫ø) serve the Beijiang and Nanjiang areas respectively. The Jinji Railway connects these lines as a de facto ring railroad. A web of around 60 km of internal railways goes deep into the wharves and storage yards of the Beijiang area. The Nanjiang area is primarily connected through the Nanjiang Rail Bridge. This bridge was expanded to double-track in 2010, for an annual capacity of 70 million tonnes. A second bridge is under construction. A conveyor belt corridor runs parallel to the railway, carrying coal and ore to the Bulk Logistics Center. Highways and roads: The internal roads in the Port carry an enormously heavy, noisy and noisome flow of traffic, and traffic jams are not uncommon at certain bottlenecks. The internal roads at the three main Port areas form a broken grid pattern, the east‚Äìwest roads connecting with the expressways that feed the port. The main north‚Äìsouth roads are the Yuejin road transfixing the Container Logistics Center, the Meizhou (Americas) Road in the Dongjiang Area. The backbone road of the Port is the S11 Haibin Expressway (Êµ∑Êª®È´òÈÄü), which runs north-south and roughly represents the Port's western boundary.As the expressway follows the original coastline, most of the land east of the road is reclaimed land, including most of the Port. The main east-west feeder roads are the S40 Jingjintang Expressway (‰∫¨Ê¥•Â°òÈ´òÈÄü), which merges into the Jingmen road; the S13 Jinbin Expressway ( Ê¥•Êª®È´òÈÄü) and the G103 Highway, which both merge into the Xingang Fourth Road; and the S30 Jingjin Expressway (‰∫¨Ê¥•È´òÈÄü), which becomes the Jishuanggang road and then the Xingang 8th Road into Dongjiang. In the south, the Tianjin Avenue and the S50 Jinpu Expressway (Ê¥•Êµ¶È´òÈÄü) connect into the Nanjiang and Lingang areas. These feeder roads connect in turn with the thick Beijing-Tianjin road hub, with seven radial expressways from Beijing and four from Tianjin. Of these, the Jinji Expressway (S1) is the main alternative route into Beijing (through Pinggu) and the Northwest (through the 6th Ring Road and the G6 Jingla Expressway), while the G25 Changzhen Expressway is the main North-South connector. Airports: The Port is 30 minutes away from Tianjin Binhai International Airport, and 120 min from Beijing Capital International Airport. Two small general aviation aerodromes‚ÄîTanggu Airport (Â°òÊ≤ΩÊú∫Âú∫) and Binhai Eastern General Heliport (Êª®Êµ∑‰∏úÊñπÈÄöÁî®Áõ¥ÂçáÊú∫Âú∫)‚Äî provide offshore helicopter shuttles and other services to Port operators.  Logistics centers, yards and warehouses  Map of the Tianjin Port Container Logistics Center The Tianjin Port Container Logistics Center (Â§©Ê¥•Ê∏ØÈõÜË£ÖÁÆ±Áâ©ÊµÅ‰∏≠ÂøÉ) is located in the north part of the Beijiang area, in 7.03 km¬≤ of reclaimed land. The Center currently hosts 42 logistics enterprises, and it has 350 hectares of yard space, 26 hectares of warehouses, or about 60% of the Port's container handling capacity. Heavy traffic at the Container Logistics CenterTianjin Port International Logistics Development Co. Ltd. (TPL) was established in 2003 to take charge of the development, construction, operation and management of the Center. The Tianjin Port Bulk Logistics Center (Â§©Ê¥•Ê∏ØÊï£Ë¥ßÁâ©ÊµÅ‰∏≠ÂøÉ) opened in 2000, built on 26.8 km2 of former salt flats to the south of Donggu. It serves as a large storage and distribution area for coal, ore and other bulk cargoes. As of April 2011, there were 268 enterprises operating within it. The Bulk Logistics Center is being progressively relocated south, to the Nangang area, to free its land for urban development (i. e. the Binhai Central New Town ‚Äì Êª®Êµ∑‰∏≠ÈÉ®Êñ∞Âüé) The 12-5 plan envisages six large logistics parks in the port area by 2015: the Container Logistics and Bulk Cargo Centers will be upgraded to \\"Parks\\" (with additional policy privileges), joined by the newly established Nangang Chemical Logistics Park (ÂçóÊ∏ØÂåñÂ∑•Áâ©ÊµÅÂõ≠Âå∫), Lingang Industrial ProLogis Logistics Park (‰∏¥Ê∏ØÂ∑•‰∏öÊôÆÊ¥õÊñØÁâ©ÊµÅÂõ≠Âå∫), and the Central Fishing Port Logistics Park (‰∏≠ÂøÉÊ∏îÊ∏ØÁâ©ÊµÅÂõ≠Âå∫).  Intermodal transportation and dry ports  Economic Hinterland: The hinterland of the Tianjin Port (as determined by existing railway and road patterns) is vast. It includes the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin, and the provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Gansu, Qinghai, Tibet and Xinjiang, amounting to over 5 million km2, or 52ÔºÖ of China's area, and covering 17% of the country's population. Tianjin is also one of the railheads of the Eurasian Land Bridge.Tianjin Port is often named in publicity material as the start of the Chinese branch of Eurasian Land Bridge. Officially, however, the port of Lianyungang is the Bridge's start. Tianjin is indeed the proposed railhead of the UNESCAP Intermodal Transport Corridor 1 from Busan to Yekaterinburg via Irkutsk. Dedicated Container Train Routes: TPL owns and operates 15 different scheduled railway routes, dispatching 50-car (100 TEU) trains to 15 different cities in China, including Xi'an, Chengdu, Taiyuan, √úr√ºmqi, Baotou, Shizuishan, Erenhot, Alashankou, and Manzhouli, the last three being border crossings. In the first half of 2011, these dedicated train lines carried 129,000 TEU, including cargoes for Eurasian destinations. Dry Ports: As of October 2011, Tianjin Port had established 21 dry ports, of which 8 were fully operational. These ports are located at:√å√¨¬Ω√≤√ä√ê√à√ã√É√±√ï√æ¬∏¬Æ¬ø√ö¬∞¬∂¬∞√¨¬π¬´√ä√í .

The mineral water trade was once a thriving industry in Preston, the largest manufacturer of which was Ellis Wilkinson, who first began making mineral waters at the same time that Matthew Brown was making his home-brewed ale at his small Pole Street, Preston, Brewery. Ellis and Matthew were friends who began making drinks together. In addition to supplying local shops, Wilkinson's also agreed to supply Matthew Brown's growing number of pubs with minerals and also facilitated the production of drinks for Vimto in their early days of trading. Ellis Wilkinson's first wife died in childbirth. His second wife was a strict Quaker from the USA and she played a prominent part in running the mineral water business. Banking services in those days were limited and one of her tasks was to collect the roundsmen's cash. She stored the gold sovereigns in a bucket beneath the bed of their home, Ribbleton House, which stood in its own grounds near Gamull Lane. Mixing the mineral water fruit essences in the early days was a skilled job but later they installed a carbonating and bottling plant. In 1928 the firm became a limited company with Wilkinson's four sons as the directors. Wilkinson's had an extensive range of drinks on their portfolio which were popular throughout the North West. In addition to manufacturing pop, Wilkinson's were also chocolate and sweet wholesalers, which were made on site. Wilkinsons's also supplied tea and wine. At the peak of their trade they employed about 40 people. In 1967 Ellis Wilkinson's merged with T. and R. Smith's soft drinks of Chorley who had already been taken over by Garfield Weston. Other former local mineral firms who were already part of this group were Clayton's of Chorley, Medico of Blackburn, St Annes Mineral Waters and Turner's of Chorley. In 1969 change was still in the air and T. and R. Smith's was taken over by J. N. Nichols (Vimto) of Manchester. Director and general manager of the Chorley concern since 1967 was Ronald Wilkinson who was the Grandson of Ellis Wilkinson the founder of the former Preston mineral water business.

It is a sequel to the film Steptoe and Son (1972) based on the television series. As usual, the film starred Wilfrid Brambell and Harry H. Corbett. Plot The Steptoes have retired their horse - because the horse is lame, after having to pull the cart (and Harold) home from York, after the horse walked into the back of a removal van which then drove off - and plan to buy a new one with Albert's life savings of ¬£80, putting ¬£9 away for \\"emergencies\\". Harold sends Albert home and returns several hours later drunk and introduces Hercules the Second, a short sighted racing greyhound. Harold reveals to Albert that he purchased this from local gangster and loan shark Frankie Barrow for the ¬£80 plus a further ¬£200 owing on top. Furthermore, he plans to pay a small fortune to keep it fed on egg and steak. They eventually have to sell all of their possessions to have one final bet on their dog at the races to try to pay off the money they owe. When their dog loses, they just about lose hope when Albert brings up that he had saved ¬£1,000 in a life insurance policy. Harold then schemes to get the money from his father by faking his death. They find an old mannequin among their collection of junk and fit it around Albert's body. They then call Dr. Popplewell, a known alcoholic doctor, who is drunk at the time of seeing Albert and he announces that Albert has died. Harold then brings home a coffin that he has been saving for the inevitable day that his father would actually die. The next day, the gangsters turn up to collect the outstanding debt, but after some intimidation Harold manages to stave them off when he shows that Albert has \\"died\\" and they will get their money when the insurance policy pays out. Later on, old friends of Albert's come to visit and pay their respects to Albert. They announce that they have arranged a funeral for him and this is not good news for either of the Steptoes. Later one of Albert's friends ask if he could look at him for a final time. Knowing that the coffin is actually full of scrap metal, Harold makes the excuse that his father's face is all distorted because of a difficult visit to the lavatory which is what caused him to die. Later on an entire army of mourners come to the Steptoe household. Along with them Mr Russell from the insurance company enters. Harold meets him to collect the proceeds - only to find out that all of the insurance money is to go to a lover that Albert met in 1949 while Harold was in the army in Malaya. A furious Harold asks why he did not cancel the insurance plan and Albert's only excuse is \\"I forgot.\\" Harold concocts a way of bringing Albert back to life. However once inside the coffin, Albert falls into a deep sleep and nothing seems to wake him up. Harold tries to wake him several times during the journey to the cemetery, however on the way he is hit in the head by the back door of a removal truck. They decide to take Harold to the hospital and carry on to the funeral without him. At the hospital Harold runs away and gets a taxi to the cemetery. There Harold accidentally smashes into a tomb and whilst being buried Albert finally wakes up and frightens everyone away. The vicar runs off and meets Harold looking like he himself is one of the undead. Back home, the Steptoes discover that the insurance claim would have paid out to Harold after all, due to a clause that Albert had put in the policy if his mistress ever married. He cashes the policy in and receives ¬£876. They pay off their debt and buy a new horse with new riding equipment, but to Albert's horror, Harold invests the rest of the money in a part share of a race horse. He discovers that his partner is called H.M. Queen. Cast * Wilfrid Brambell as Albert Steptoe * Harry H.

Originally elected as a Conservative, she left the party to join Change UK in 2019. Soubry was Parliamentary Under- Secretary of State for Public Health from 2012 until 2013, Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans from 2013 until 2015 and Minister for Small Business, Industry and Enterprise following the 2015 general election, also attending meetings of the Cabinet, but she returned to the backbenches in July 2016. In February 2019, Soubry resigned from the Conservative Party and joined The Independent Group. She was appointed Leader of Change UK in June 2019. She lost her seat to Darren Henry of the Conservative Party in the 2019 general election. Early life Soubry was born in Lincoln Hospital, Lincolnshire, where her mother Frances Soubry (n√©e Coward)https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?scan=1&r;=214070195:6195&d;=bmd_1581352778 worked. Her father was David Soubry, a Nottinghamshire garage owner. She was brought up in Dunham-on-Trent and Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire. Soubry attended the Henry Hartland Grammar School from 1968 to 1970, in which year it became the Hartland Comprehensive; she remained at the school until 1975, in which year she joined the Conservative Party. She was involved in student politics in the 1970s, becoming the only Conservative member of the National Union of Students' executive committee. She graduated with a degree in Law from the University of Birmingham in 1979. She left the Conservatives in 1981, alongside seven other former student leaders, who said at a press conference that the party remained \\"class based\\" and that the Social Democratic Party (SDP) was now the natural home of young people who \\"wish to see a prosperously united country\\". It was reported at the time that Soubry had joined the SDP, along with the others in the group, but in 2018 she denied having done so. Early career Soubry was a journalist from 1981 until 1995. She reported on and presented several regional and networked TV programmes, including Central Television's Central Weekend, Grampian Television's North Tonight in the North of Scotland and the East Midlands regional news programme, Central News East. She also presented and reported Granada Television's This Morning in the late 1980s, and returned to Liverpool's Albert Dock in October 2013 for the This Morning 25th-anniversary party. Soubry was called to the bar in 1995, and is a member of the Criminal Bar Association. She was the Conservative Party candidate for the Gedling constituency in Nottinghamshire at the 2005 general election. During the campaign she said she was \\"ashamed\\" of living in Nottingham because it had a bad reputation for crime. She stated she was not ashamed of the people of Nottingham, but was ashamed of what had happened to the city. Soubry was chosen as an \\"A-List candidate\\", and in 2006 was selected as Conservative candidate for the nearby Broxtowe constituency. During a debate in front of sixth formers in 2006, she said an honest debate was needed to stop people taking Class A drugs, and that she supported the legalisation of cannabis. Parliamentary career Soubry was elected to Parliament at the 2010 general election. She was considered \\"one of the most formidable communicators of the new intake\\" by Nicholas Watt of The Guardian, but not a Thatcherite. In June 2010, Soubry was elected as a Conservative member of the Justice Select Committee. Soubry sponsored a private member's bill in June 2010 to provide anonymity to a person who has been arrested but not charged. The second reading took place in February 2011. Soubry withdrew the bill after its second reading, when Justice Minister Crispin Blunt promised the Attorney General would examine the area of concern. Soubry was a strong supporter of same-sex marriage in 2013 and voted in favour of it at every opportunity. In February 2016, Soubry spoke in favour of fracking. In November 2016, Soubry joined the Scottish Affairs Committee. At the 2017 general election Soubry retained her seat with a reduced majority on a record turnout of 75%, despite receiving the highest percentage share and number of votes for a Conservative Party candidate in Broxtowe since the 1992 election. In the 2019 general election, standing for the Independent Group for Change, Soubry polled 4,668 votes (8%) and finished 3rd thereby losing her seat to the Conservative Party candidate, Darren Henry, who polled 26,602 votes. Constituency issuesTram system= In June 2010, Soubry met the transport minister Norman Baker and called for the ¬£400,000,000 extension to the Nottingham Express Transit tram system to be scrapped, saying the money would be better spent on the A453 road. David Thornhill of the Campaign for Better Transport expressed astonishment at her opinion, and said the tram was definitely better value for money. Soubry said she was pro-tram, but that the tram route through her constituency was \\"fundamentally flawed\\". The extension nevertheless was constructed as planned. In July 2013, Soubry criticised Nottingham City Council leader Jon Collins over his refusal to meet her and others to discuss compensation for shops and businesses in the constituency which faced closure due to the tram works. Collins subsequently agreed to meet her, and the outcome was a review into the compensation packages available for affected businesses. =Royal Mail privatisation= In October 2010, Soubry wrote in her monthly column in the Beeston Express that on returning to Parliament she met a \\"somewhat shell-shocked Parliamentary Assistant bearing a pile of some 300 cards from constituents urging me to oppose the proposed sell-off of the Royal Mail.\\" She expressed dismay at the time and cost of replying to each constituent when she had already discussed the issue with the Communication Workers' Union (CWU). Twelve days later, Soubry announced in the House of Commons that of the 700 postal workers in her constituency, to her knowledge, none had written to her opposing privatisation of Royal Mail and only two had come to London. After complaints from the CWU, Soubry agreed she was wrong, but said that some of the letters had been misfiled and others had arrived late or were sent to the wrong MP, and that the CWU had been inefficient. She claimed she genuinely believed she was telling the truth, that the bill protected Royal Mail, its workers and the universal postal service, and said that was the only reason she supported it. =Support for Citizens' Advice Bureau= In November 2010, Soubry appeared on the East Midlands version of The Politics Show to discuss her efforts to help the Citizens' Advice Bureau. The programme reviewed the current state of Nottinghamshire's CAB which was facing a 30% increase in enquiries plus cuts in its budget from local councils and the Ministry of Justice. Soubry said she had asked the leader of Nottingham County Council and Kenneth Clarke to reconsider. Soubry later organised a meeting between the CAB, Midlands Women's Aid and charities minister Nick Hurd to make him aware of the effects of the proposed cuts in funding to these organisations. =HS2 (High Speed Rail)= In January 2013, Soubry welcomed the announcement of the proposed High Speed 2 East Midlands Hub station at Toton Sidings in the constituency, stating that it was \\"a very good news day for Broxtowe\\". She has held a number of public meetings on the issue. Soubry voiced criticism in August 2013 over plans to not hold a public consultation meeting in the constituency, calling on HS2 Ltd to hold an event in Toton where the proposed East Midlands Hub is to be built. National issuesSupport for NHS reforms= In an interview on the Daily Politics show in February 2012, Soubry as public health minister defended the NHS reforms. In March 2012 a group of 240 doctors wrote to The Independent describing the reforms as an \\"embarrassment to democracy\\" which had no support from professional healthcare organisations. They pledged to stand as candidates against MPs who backed them and Soubry was mentioned as a likely target. In response Soubry stated there had been no complaints from her local GP consortium and claimed that many local GPs could not wait for the Bill to be passed. =Smoking= In a Westminster Hall debate, Soubry emphasised the role advertising plays in encouraging young people to smoke. She herself took up smoking as a teenager because of the attractive packaging and she compared addiction to nicotine to heroin dependence; though she had no direct experience of the latter. According to The Daily Telegraph, her comments raised questions about why the Coalition dropped plans for plain packaging shortly after David Cameron employed Lynton Crosby, who has worked for tobacco companies, as an election strategist. Ministerial career Following her appointment as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Public Health in September 2012, Soubry gave an interview with The Times in which she stated her support for assisted suicide for terminally ill people. Both the Department of Health and the Ministry of Justice denied there were plans for reform, though her Liberal Democrat colleague Norman Lamb welcomed discussion and said he expected a private members' bill to be introduced by Lord Falconer in 2013. Assisting suicide currently carries a maximum 14-year prison sentence. On 14 September 2012, speaking at an NHS Leadership Academy conference, Soubry stated that the Coalition had \\"screwed up\\" in the way it dealt with the medical profession over the NHS reforms. Soubry later said that she fully supported the reforms but believed the benefits to patients could have been better explained and this would have won more support from health professionals. As Public Health Minister, Soubry criticised retailers who forced customers to pass \\"rows of unhealthy foods\\" on their way to the checkout and said that a new code of practice would urge retailers to stop this and also reduce deals on unhealthy food. In August 2013, as Public Health Minister, Soubry supported plans for a change in the law to allow HIV home- testing kits. Soubry was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence in David Cameron's October 2013 reshuffle, becoming the first elected female politician to be a Minister in the MoD. In the July 2014 reshuffle, Soubry was appointed Minister of State for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans. Following the 2015 general election, Soubry became Minister of State at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills until 15 July 2016. Her partner, Neil Davidson, is a director at Morrisons leading her opponents to note a potential conflict of interest when she introduced new Sunday trading laws. European UnionEU withdrawal referendum= Soubry is a strong supporter of Britain remaining in the European Union, and backed the \\"Remain\\" campaign during the 2016 EU membership referendum, the holding of which she supported. In September 2016, Soubry criticised members of Vote Leave when it became clear that the pledge \\"at the heart ‚Ä¶ of their message\\" of ¬£350,000,000 a week of extra funding for the NHS was being dropped from post-Brexit plans. Following a leaked Treasury report which claimed that the estimated annual cost to the UK Treasury of a \\"hard Brexit\\" would be between ¬£38bn and ¬£66bn per year after 15 years, Soubry referenced the loss of money for schools and hospitals and stated that Parliament should be involved in the principles guiding Brexit negotiations. =Following the referendum= Following the referendum, in which Broxtowe had a 54.6% vote to leave, Soubry criticised former Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who led the \\"Leave\\" campaign, accusing him of backing Britain's exit from the EU because he wanted to be Prime Minister: \\"My anger with Boris is that I don't honestly believe that he believed what he was saying to people\\". Appearing as a guest on BBC One's Question Time in June 2016, Soubry warned that some people who voted to leave the EU had disregarded tolerance, and describing it as \\"[not] our country's finest hour\\". She urged the UK to put \\"hope over hatred\\" following the result. In February 2017, Soubry voted to invoke Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, triggering the process of withdrawal from the EU, saying: \\"I said I will honour the result of the referendum, so I voted to trigger article 50. So, I accept we are leaving the European Union, even though the result was close. My argument now is how do we get the best deal, and I want parliament, finally, to be involved in getting the best deal for our country.\\"Peter Walker, Anna Soubry receives messages calling for her to be hanged as a traitor , The Guardian (15 December 2017). In parliamentary debate over the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, Soubry said: \\"I did not vote with my conscience, and if I am truthful about it, I am not sure that I voted in the best interests of my constituents. ... However, I was true to the promise that I had made to my constituents. I had promised them that if they voted leave, they would get leave, and that is what drove me through the Lobbies last week with a heavy heart and against my conscience.\\"European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, Hansard (7 February 2017), Vol. 621. Addressing a Brexit protest outside Parliament in June 2016 she described how her 84-year-old mother, and her daughters, had \\"wept\\" on the morning that the result was announced. In an emotional and impromptu speech she told the gathering \\"We made a terrible, terrible mistake on Friday\\" and urged those wanting to stay in the European Union to continue fighting for that cause. In December 2017, Soubry was one of 11 Conservative rebels who voted in favour of Parliament being guaranteed a vote on the final Brexit deal, despite the government's reluctance, with enough Conservatives rebelling that the measure was forced through. In January 2018, Soubry said the government should not let the 35 MPs she described as \\"hard Brexiteers\\" dictate the terms of Brexit. On 15 April 2018, Soubry attended the launch event of the People's Vote, a campaign group calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union. Later that year, Soubry declared that there should be a national government to solve the issue of Brexit and went on to argue that members of the European Research Group should be expelled from the Conservative Party. In December 2018, she declared that she would resign the Conservative whip and vote to have no confidence in her government if 'no deal' became the policy of the government. In December 2018, Soubry was harassed by a group of protesters in Westminster she described as \\"far-right\\". They referred to her as \\"on the side of Adolf Hitler\\" and called her a traitor for her anti-Brexit stance. This was met with condemnation from MPs of all sides of the political spectrum, and by the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow. In February 2019, James Goddard, one of the activists who accosted Soubry, was charged with harassment in connection with the incident in December 2018 and a separate incident outside Parliament in January 2019. In early 2019, Soubry co-founded the group Right to Vote. The Independent Group Soubry resigned from the Conservative Party on 20 February 2019, along with Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston, and joined The Independent Group, later Change UK. Soubry stated that \\"the right wing, the hard-line anti-EU awkward squad\\" had hijacked the Conservative Party from top to toe. On 4 June 2019, Change UK announced Soubry as their leader after six of the 11 MPs left to sit as independents and Heidi Allen resigned as leader. Soubry commented that she was \\"deeply disappointed\\" at the split. Following the new party's failure to win at the December 2019 general election, Soubry announced that the Independent Group for Change would be disbanded. All three of the party's MPs who sought re-election were defeated with Soubry coming \\"a distant third in Broxtowe\\". Soubry stated that while there was \\"a need for massive change in British politics,\\" without representation in parliament \\"a longer-term realignment will have to take place in a different way\\". Personal life Soubry has been married twice, and is a mother of two daughters by her marriage to Haig Gordon. She has been reported to be in a relationship with Neil Davidson, a non-executive director of Morrisons supermarket.

An image of a thylacine pugmark Wildlife conservationists are known to catalogue pugmarks in the areas they operate. Pugmarks are also used for tracking rogue animals which may be a danger to mankind or even to themselves because of injuries etc. It is possible to make an accurate identification of species, sex, age and physical condition of an animal by those trained in the field. Field data collection In India, ‚ÄòPugmark Tracking‚Äô involves collection of pugmark tracings and plaster casts from the field and analysis of these separately for individual male, female, and cub of tiger and leopard, and their diagnostic track dimensions and spatial distribution. In order to obtain good pug impressions, PIPs (pug impression pads) are laid along roads, animal tracks and footpaths. To cite an example, during the year 2002, in 71 Census Units of Similipal 8946 PIPs were laid over 1773 km of tracking routes, from which 764 pugmark tracings were collected along with 316 plaster casts. Field data for each pugmark are collected in specially devised census forms. The plaster casts and tracings along with field information are together analysed with map of the area to remove repetitions and overlaps in pug-evidences collected for the same tiger. Pugmark of a bear A polar bear pugmark The final result indicates the (a) total numbers of male, female and cub of tiger and leopard, (b) their pugmark dimensions with stride where available, (c) the names of locations where the pugmarks of each tiger have been traced to show the gross movement areas (d) interrelationship among different tigers by linking each male to female and the latter to cubs tracked in the movement area, and finally (e) spatial distribution map. Benefits as a data collection method The above approach to pugmark tracking has been developed and got refined over three decades since it was first implemented in the year 1972 at the All India Level. Compared to any other method of data collection on a population of large carnivores, ‚ÄòPugmark tracking‚Äô is considered quick, involving about 10 days of ground preparation, 6 days of rigorous data collection, and about two to four weeks of data analysis. It is very cost-effective or economic, and all money spent in the process goes to local tribal people who act as assistants as they possess the skill to track animals in Indian jungles. It results in data which shows which forest beat possess how many, of what sex/age and which type of large carnivore. This brings a sense of responsibility among the guards, as none of the animals is ‚Äòvirtually‚Äô generated through statistical interpretations. Like any study technique, Pugmark tracking also calls for sincerity for true reflection of structure and spatial distribution of the population of large carnivores.

Webb's Hotel The current office building was built in 1833 as a hotel. The hotel was used for meetings of South Caradon Mine. Under Cornish Stannary Laws cost book system, two monthly meetings were held at which the purser presented the accounts. The result of the meeting was the owners sharing the profits or meeting any debts, the 'calls'. The owners' names were held in 'cost books', from which their entry could be deleted after settling outstanding calls. The system existed until 1883. The hotel has featured in royal visits, parliamentary declarations and much more but was recently converted into flats and offices. The hotel is a Grade II listed building. It was abandoned and derelict in 1989, but a property developer purchased it in 2001 with plans to return it to its original state. It was reopened in 2005 to great local acclaim. As it is no longer a hotel, the building was renamed Webb's House. The area in front of the building has also been re-landscaped with granite seating, flower borders and a Celtic cross.

It uses techniques from spatial analysis, but also encompasses geographical activities such as the defining and naming of geographical regions for statistical purposes. For example, for the purposes of statistical geography, the Australian Bureau of Statistics uses the Australian Standard Geographical Classification, a hierarchical regionalisation that divides Australia up into states and territories, then statistical divisions, statistical subdivisions, statistical local areas, and finally census collection districts. Background Devil's Punchbowl Waterfall, New Zealand may be studied using geostatistics Geographers study how and why elements differ from place to place, as well as how spatial patterns change through time. Geographers begin with the question 'Where?', exploring how features are distributed on a physical or cultural landscape, observing spatial patterns and the variation of phenomena. Contemporary geographical analysis has shifted to 'Why?', determining why a specific spatial pattern exists, what spatial or ecological processes may have affected a pattern, and why such processes operate. Only by approaching the 'why?' questions can social scientists begin to appreciate the mechanisms of change, which are infinite in their complexity. Role of statistics in geography Statistical techniques and procedures are applied in all fields of academic research; wherever data are collected and summarized or wherever any numerical information is analyzed or research is conducted, statistics are needed for sound analysis and interpretation of results. Geographers use statistics in numerous ways: * To describe and summarize spatial data. * To make generalizations concerning complex spatial patterns. * To estimate the probability of outcomes for an event at a given location. * To use samples of geographic data to infer characteristics for a larger set of geographic data (population). * To determine if the magnitude or frequency of some phenomenon differs from one location to another. * To learn whether an actual spatial pattern matches some expected pattern. Spatial data and descriptive statistics There are several potential difficulties associated with the analysis of spatial data, among these are boundary delineation, modifiable areal units, and the level of spatial aggregation or scale. In each of these cases, the absolute descriptive statistics of an area - the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variation - are changed through the manipulation of these spatial problems. Boundary delineation The location of a study area boundary and the positioning of internal boundaries affect various descriptive statistics. With respect to measures such as the mean or standard deviation, the study area size alone may have large implications; consider a study of per capita income within a city, if confined to the inner city, income levels are likely to be lower because of a less affluent population, if expanded to include the suburbs or surrounding communities, income levels will become greater with the influence of homeowner populations. Because of this problem, absolute descriptive statistics such as the mean, standard deviation, and variance should be evaluated comparatively only in relation to a particular study area. In the determination of internal boundaries this is also true, as these statistics may only have valid interpretations for the area and subarea configuration over which they are calculated. Modifiable areal units See also: Modifiable areal unit problem In many cases the subdivision of spatial data has already been determined, this is evident in demographic datasets, as the available information will be grouped into their respective counties or municipalities. For this type of data, analysts must use the same county or municipal boundaries delineated in the collected data for their subsequent analysis. When alternate boundaries are possible, an analyst must take into account that any new subdivision model may create different results. ;; Spatial aggregation/scale problem Socio-economic data may be available at a variety of scales, for example: municipalities, regional districts, census tracts, enumeration districts, or at the provincial/state level. When this data is aggregated at different scales, the resulting descriptive statistics may exhibit variations, either in a systematic, predictable way, or in a more uncertain fashion. If we are observing economic data, we may notice a distinct reduction in manufacturing productivity for a country (the USA) over a certain period; since this is a general model, individual states may experience these effects differently. The result of this aggregation is that the standard deviation of the data in question is increased due to the variability among states.''' Descriptive spatial statistics :See main article Spatial descriptive statistics For summarizing point pattern analysis, a set of descriptive spatial statistics has been developed that are areal equivalents to nonspatial measures. Since geographers are particularly concerned with the analysis of locational data, these descriptive spatial statistics (geostatistics) are often applied to summarize point patterns and to describe the degree of spatial variability of some phenomena. Spatial measures of central tendency An example here is the idea of a center of population, of which a particular example is the mean center of U.S. population. Several different ways of defining a center are available: *Mean center: The mean is an important measure of central tendency, which when extended to a set of points, located on a Cartesian coordinate system, the average location, centroid or mean center, can be determined. *The weighted mean center is analogous to frequencies in the calculation of grouped statistics, such as the weighted mean. A point may represent a retail outlet, while its frequency will represent the volume of sales within the particular store. *Median center or Euclidean center and in the median center of United States population. This is related to the Manhattan distance. Spatial measures of dispersion *Standard distance Just as the standard deviation indicates how closely the values in a data set are clustered around the mean, so standard distance in a spatial distribution indicates how closely the points are clustered around the mean centre. *Relative distance Topology The Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg, one of the most famous problems in topology The motivating insight behind topology is that some geometric problems depend not on the exact shape of the objects involved, but rather on the \\"way they are connected together\\". One of the first papers in topology was the demonstration, by Leonhard Euler, that it was impossible to find a route through the town of K√∂nigsberg (now Kaliningrad) that would cross each of its seven bridges exactly once. This result did not depend on the lengths of the bridges, nor on their distance from one another, but only on connectivity properties: which bridges are connected to which islands or riverbanks. This problem, the Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg, is now a famous problem in introductory mathematics, and led to the branch of mathematics known as graph theory. Topology rules Topology rules are particularly important within GIS, and are used for a variety of correction and analytical procedures. The primary shapes in GIS are the point, line, and polygon, each of which implies different spatial characteristics; for instance, the only shape which has a distinguishable inside and outside is the polygon. Principles of connectivity associated with topology lead to applications in hydrology, urban planning, and logistics, as well as other fields; as such, topological analyses offer unique modelling capabilities, defining the vector nature of topological features and correcting spatial data errors from digitizing. National examples=United Kingdom Due to the devolved nature of the United Kingdom, responsibility for managing statistical geographies often falls to the National Statistical Institute with jurisdiction for that devolved administration. For England and Wales this is the Office for National Statistics, for Scotland National Records of Scotland and for Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency. =England and Wales= The lowest form of statistical geography in England and Wales is the Output Area. These are small geographies of approximately 300 people and 100 households for which Census data is published. By containing roughly the same number of people and households it is possible to compare statistics for any two Output Areas in the country, and know that this is being done in a consistent way (unlike comparing statistics for Administrative geographies). The Output Areas form the smallest part of a hierarchy that consists of Output Areas, Lower Layer Super Output Areas and Middle Layer Super Output Areas. England and Wales also have a statistical geography designed specifically for the publication of workplace statistics. This is because Output Areas are built around residential populations and make analysing workplace statistics difficult. Workplace Zones have been released as part of the 2011 Census. =Scotland= Like England and Wales, the lowest level of statistical geography in Scotland is the Output Area. Scottish OAs are smaller than those for England and Wales because smaller thresholds are applied, but the methodology for their creation is broadly similar to that used by ONS. The higher levels are again similar to England and Wales but operate as Data Zones and Intermediate Zones rather than Lower and Middle Layer Super Output Areas. There are no Workplace Zones for Scotland.

The film was followed by the sequel Captain America II: Death Too Soon, also released in the same year. Plot Steve Rogers (Reb Brown) is a contemporary man whose father was a 1940s government agent. The very patriotic attitude of Steve's father earned him the nickname \\"Captain America\\". His father was later murdered. Rogers, a former Marine now making a living as an artist and traveling the countryside in a conversion van, is inspired by his father's story to sketch a superhero. After receiving potentially fatal injuries in an attempt on his life intended to seem like an accident, he is administered an experimental chemical called the FLAG formula; FLAG is an acronym for \\"Full Latent Ability Gain\\", a kind of \\"super-steroid\\" (Rogers's father had developed the FLAG serum from his own glands). The formula not only saves his life, but enhances his strength and reflexes. These new abilities inspire Dr. Simon Mills (Len Birman), the research biochemist and intelligence official behind FLAG who was once a friend of Steve's father, to recruit Steve and give him a costume based on his drawing.

The municipality consists of the two Katastralgemeinden: M√∂llbr√ºcke and Pusarnitz, comprising several small villages. It is located within the eponymous valley of the Drava river, on the southern slope of the Ankogel Group of the Hohe Tauern range, west of the district's capital Spittal an der Drau. At M√∂llbr√ºcke is the confluence of the Drava with the M√∂ll tributary. In the west the valley is confined by the mountains of the Kreuzeck group and in the south by the Gailtal Alps. History The Lurnfeld valley around the Roman city of Teurnia is a very old settlement area, in ancient times called vallis Lurna. In an 891 deed mentioned as Liburnia, it became the centre of the Upper Carinthian counts in the medi√¶val Lurngau, who resided at Hohenburg Castle. Their dominions then stretched from west of Villach up the Drava to Lienz and the Tyrolean border. Pusarnitz already appeared in a 1072 deed. After the Counts of Lurn became extinct in 1135, it was among the Carinthian possessions of the Salzburg archbishops. The remaining estates were inherited by the Counts of Ortenburg, while the Tyrolean Meinhardiner dynasty, Counts of G√∂rz since 1127, expanded their possessions in the west. The main village M√∂llbr√ºcke was first mentioned as m√∂lnprukke in 1253. In 1307 it was denoted as a possession of the Meinhardiner counts of G√∂rz and seat of a county court. When the Carinthian counts of Ortenburg became extinct in 1418, their estates were bequested to the Counts of Celje. Count Ulrich II was even elevated to a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire by the Emperor Sigismund, but left no heirs when he was killed by his bitter rival Ladislaus Hunyadi in 1456. He had signed an inheritance treaty with the Habsburg emperor Frederick III, also Duke of Carinthia since 1424. However, the Meinhardiner count John II of G√∂rz also claimed the former Ortenburg dominions. He marched against Carinthia from his Tyrolean residence at Bruck Castle, crossing the border at Oberdrauburg and occupying Spittal to lay siege to the Ortenburg fortress. He was finally defeated in 1460 and had to sign the Treaty of Pusarnitz at episcopal Feldsberg Castle, whereby he renounced all Carinthian estates in favour of the Austrian House of Habsburg. Politics The Lurnfeld municipality was created by the merger of M√∂llbr√ºcke, Pusarnitz and neighbouring Sachsenburg in 1973; the citizens of Sachsenburg decided to split off again in 1992.

He was the father of the former President of Albania, Alfred Moisiu. Early life Spiro Moisiu was born on 5 May 1900 in Kavaj√´, to Theodori Moisiu, an educated merchant fluent in several languages, and Ana Stavri. Spiro's father came from the well-known Moisiu family of Kavaj√´ which had roots in the city as far back as the 16th century. He was a close relative of the famous actor Alexander Moissi. Spiro's grandfather Gregor and Aleksand√´r's grandfather Kostandin were brothers and the sons of Themistokli Moisiu. Theodori was killed in 1913 by the rebels who opposed the Albanian government of Ismail Qemali. This left a young Spiro to be raised by his mother. Education After finishing the elementary school in Kavaj√´ and Durr√´s he was sent to complete his education in a college in Vienna, Austria. He returned from Austria in 1919 and after following a military course directed by German and Austrian instructors in Tirana graduated as lieutenant. In 1920, as a member of the Albanian governmental forces, Spiro was appointed to the protection forces of the Congress of Lushnje. Later that year he was appointed as a chief of staff of the Albanian government brigade fighting against Serb forces in the Martanesh area. During the uprising of June 1924, he supported the revolutionary forces led by Fan Noli. In December 1924, when Ahmet Zogu returned to Albania supported by Yugoslav forces, he fought against him in the Battle of Tujan. After Ahmet Zogu returned to power, Spiro Moisiu did not flee like the majority of his fellow soldiers but remained in Albania profiting from the amnesty that Zogu gave to most of those who had participated in the uprising. Military service under the Zog Monarchy Admitting his excellent capacities Zogu reintegrated Spiro Moisiu in the Albanian governmental forces. His military career was advanced further in 1929‚Äì30 when he achieved excellent results at the military school of \\"Officers perfectionism\\" in Tirana under the direction of Italian instructors. After finishing first on his course among 43 other officers he was appointed as captain. During the Zog monarchy he served in different cities, while during the anti-governmental Insurrection of Fier in 1935, he maintained his loyalty to Zog fighting against the mutineers. During 1937‚Äì1938 he again achieved excellent results at military school in Tirana in studies for senior officers and graduated as major. Military service in World War II=Italian period Congress of 1944 in P√´rmet. Moisiu (front row third from left) with other LANC leaders In April 1939 during the Italian fascist aggression he was the commander of border forces in the Shkod√´r region. He organised the forces at his disposal to make a stand in Sh√´ngjin. Seeing the superiority of Italian forces and not wanting his forces to surrender to Italians, Spiro along with his men exiled to Yugoslavia and remained there until the beginning of 1940. Accepting an invitation for his reinstatement into the Albanian governmental forces, Moisiu returned to Albania and at the end of 1940, while serving as the commander of Tomorri battalion, he was sent to the Italian-Greek front. Spiro did not want to fight against the Greeks and along with another Albanian major, Prenk Pervizi, withdrew his men from the front lines and induced many Albanians to desert. This caused him to be deported to a military post in La√ß where he was kept under strict surveillance until the Italian High Military Court condemned him to death for desertion from the front lines. The sentence was later cancelled and his only punishment was dismissal from military service. This was because the Italians feared a mutiny of the Albanian soldiers who were still under Italian command. Major General of the National Liberation Army After his retirement from military service he was sent to the Berat region. He was there contacted by communists who on July 1943 proposed him to be the General Commander of Communist-dominated Albanian National Liberation Army (ANLA). He had the merit of turning the dispersed and not very well organised Albanian resistance forces into a regular army. Under his military leadership the ANLA was able to withstand two major offensives of the Germans in the winter of 1943-44 and in June 1944, while at the same time keeping the Germans under constant attacks; to win the war against the nationalist forces who opposed the ANLA, such as Balli Komb√´tar, Legaliteti and others; and to liberate the country on November 29, 1944, Albania being the only country in Europe to have done so without the participation of Allied forces. After World War II=Opposition to Yugoslavia He opposed the model proposed by the Yugoslavs for the reorganization of the Albanian army, and preferred Soviet instructors to Yugoslav ones. He sent many Albanian officers to Soviet military academies in order to create a new generation of Albanian officers. Retirement During a trial in 1946 one of the defendants testified that they had the support of Spiro Moisiu in a possible coup d'√©tat. This led to his discharge from active duty and military service while he was only 46 years old. Spiro Moisiu was married to Aspasi Druga from the reputable Druga family of Kavaj√´. The couple had three children, Alfred, Jolanda and Arqile.

Geography Main square It is situated in a high valley of the Hohe Tauern mountain range stretching southwards down to Obervellach on the M√∂ll river and separating the Ankogel Group in the east from the Goldberg Group in the west. In the north the Alpine crest marks the border with the Austrian state of Salzburg. At Mallnitz the Tauern Railway enters into the south portal of the Tauern Tunnel. The municipal area consists of the cadastral communities of Mallnitz proper and D√∂sen. The northern parts belong to the High Tauern National Park territory. History A trade route across the mountain passes to the Gastein Valley in the north may already existed in the Bronze Age. It was used by the Celts from about 400 BC, and when the area was incorporated into the Roman Noricum province about 15 BC, these bridle paths were rebuilt as a Roman road. A first settlement on the ancient route was probably established during the Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps from about 600 onwards; the locality of Malinica, however, was not mentioned before 1299. The surrounding estates around Falkenstein Castle then were held by the Imperial Counts of G√∂rz residing at Lienz. Throughout the Middle Ages, Mallnitz was a strategic important outpost on the trade route to Salzburg, especially for the transport of salt and gold mined in the Hohe Tauern ranges. The present-day municipality was split off from Obervellach in 1895. The local economy was decisively promoted by the building of the Tauern Tunnel from 1901 to 1907 and the inauguration of the Tauern Railway line in 1909.

Meaning of organic Many factors are taken into consideration when coffee is considered for organic certification. For example, the coffee farm's fertilizer must be 100% organic. Some organic fertilizer options include chicken manure, coffee pulp, bocachi and general compost. If inorganic fertilizers such as synthetic nitrogen, phosphate, and potash are used, then the crop grown cannot be certified organic. In the US, organic coffee crops are overseen by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Although these standards discourage the use of chemicals on cropland within three years preceding the harvest in question, exemptions can be made. This means that not all USDA certified organic products are necessarily free of chemical residues. Meanwhile, the Organic Food Production Act of 1990 (OFPA) focuses on the production of coffee after the harvest. OFPA regulates the use of chemicals on the product and how the coffee beans are handled throughout the production process. Regulations are not necessarily stringent; the former vice-chair of the U.S. National Organic Standards Board has stated that \\"Organic labels are not statements regarding the healthiness, nutritional value, or overall safety of consuming such products\\" (Liu 333). Organic producers According to the center for Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education in Costa Rica (CATIE), 75% of the world's organic coffee comes from Latin America. In addition, a number of Asian and African countries produce organic coffee, including Indonesia and Ethiopia. As of 2010, Peru was the leading exporter of organic coffee, with over 423,000 bags exported that year. Honduras and Mexico each produce over 100,000 bags annually. Other large producers include Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Organic coffee production is generally on the rise in Latin America. As of 2010, about 10% of one-time organic growers had given in to conventional production due to price competition. However, this trend is reversing as consumers increasingly demand organic goods and investors step in to supply loans with manageable interest rates. To be sold as organic in the U.S., imported coffee must gain organic certification. Among other standards, this includes meeting the following requirements: *The coffee is grown on land that wasn't exposed to synthetic pesticides or other prohibited substances for 3 years prior. *A sufficient buffer exists between the organic coffee and the closest conventional crop. *A sustainable crop rotation plan is in place to prevent erosion, the depletion of soil nutrients, and to naturally control for pests. Effects of organic coffee on the environment Organic agriculture can strengthen the natural environment's resistance to disease. For example, coffee of this standard is generally shade-grown, a quality that promotes forest preservation. Other benefits of this process include the minimization of soil erosion and participation in a healthy ecosystem. Bird populations develop mutually beneficial relationships with coffee fields, enjoying the habitat while keeping insect populations under control and naturally fertilizing the soil. Small-scale farming Small-scale farming can have an enormous impact on soil remediation. Organic coffee helps soils even though, \\"1/3 [of] farmers had problems obtaining organic fertilizer[s]\\". Many would-be organic farmers lack the funding to establish environmentally friendly fertilizers to help their coffee grow at competitive rates. The prices that farmers get for their coffee may vary drastically (3021).Valkila, Joni. \\"Fair Trade Organic Coffee Production in Nicargagua -- Sustainable Development or a Poverty Trap?\\" Ecological Economics 68.12 (2009): 3018-025. Academic Search Complete. Web. 15 November 2011. Organic fertilizers Organic fertilizers are a huge factor in dictating whether coffee can be certified organic. Organic fertilizers can reduce soil erosion and increase fertility by lowering bulk density. This means that farmers are not only growing healthy coffee, but they are putting vital nutrients back into their soils to help the next crop. The coffee plant has a vital nutrient it produces ‚Äì coffee pulp. Coffee pulp is the outside of the plant that can be salvaged and returned to the soil as an organic fertilizer. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are the major nutrients that coffee plants need so by using the coffee pulp, cattle manure, bocachi and compost, and chicken manure and biogreen, farmers are able to supply those essential nutrients to the plant cheaper.Valkila, Joni. \\"Fair Trade Organic Coffee Production in Nicaragua -- Sustainable Development or a Poverty Trap?\\" Ecological Economics 68.12 (2009): 3018-025. Academic Search Complete. Web. 15 November 2011. Prices of organic fertilizers vary widely. Because transportation costs are usually a primary hindrance, sourcing nearby fertilizers is almost essential for success. Organic fertilizers are cheaper in the long run because they replenish lost nutrients in the soil and thus helps future generation organic coffee plants. The problem with organic fertilizers is, \\"there is poor synchronization of nutrient availability and crop demand, as organic fertilizers release their nutrients slowly and not necessarily at the times when nutrients are required by crops\\". This means that growing organic coffee is slower because the nutrients take time to release, thus slowing the growth rate of the plant. Using inorganic fertilizers permits faster growth of plants because it is modified to sustain a larger yield. Inorganic fertilizers must be bought, brought onto the farm, as opposed to say recycled manure of cattle or chicken. Even though it must be bought, farmers are able to use less inorganic fertilizer because it is more concentrated than organic, but in the long run organic helps the soils and is healthier. Even though organic fertilizers are less expensive than inorganic, consumers see a higher price with organic coffee. Environmentally-conscious consumers may be willing to pay this premium.Chatterjee, Tilottama. \\"Organic Coffee Benefits.\\" Buzzle Web Portal: Intelligent Life on the Web. 2011 Buzzle.com, 16 August 2010. Web. 15 November 2011. http://www.buzzle.com/articles/organic-coffee-benefits.html. Farmers may opt to combine organic and inorganic fertilizers, which appears to maximize yield on the cultivated lands and thus decrease the need for further farming land expansion North America and its consumption of organic coffee The Organic Trade Association reported that organic coffee imports to the United States and Canada dramatically increased by 29% from 29,484 tons to 36,741 tons between the years of 2006 and 2007. Between 2007 and 2008, organic coffee imports increased to 40,370 tons, a growth of 12%. Most of these imports were also sold within the United States and Canada. Due to organic coffee's higher value (it has the greatest value of any organic import in North America) than that of conventional coffee, it only takes up approximately 3% in volume of North America's coffee market, yet its piece of the market concerning value is slightly greater than that of conventional coffee. Organic coffee accounts for about one-third of all U.S. organic beverage sales.\\"The Market For Organic and Fair-Trade Coffee.\\" Sept. 2009. Web. 30 November 2011.

The Moon Pool is a fantasy novel by American writer Abraham Merritt. It originally appeared as two short stories in All-Story Weekly: \\"The Moon Pool\\" (1918) and its sequel, \\"Conquest of the Moon Pool\\" (1919). These were then reworked into a novel released in 1919. The protagonist, Dr. Goodwin, would later appear in Merritt's second novel The Metal Monster (1920).Walter Goodwin at the Fiction Mags Index Although Merritt did not invent the \\"lost world\\" novel‚Äîhe followed in the footsteps of Bulwer-Lytton, Burroughs, Conan Doyle, and others‚Äîthis work extended the tradition. Plot summary The plot concerns an advanced race which has developed within the Earth's core. Eventually their most intelligent members create an offspring. This created entity encompasses both great good and great evil, but it slowly turns away from its creators and towards evil. The entity is called either the Dweller or the Shining One. Eventually, of the race which created it, only three are left; these are called the Silent Ones, and they have been 'purged of dross' and can be described as higher, nobler, more angelic beings than are humankind. They have also been sentenced by the good among their race to remain in the world, and not to die, as punishment for their pride which was the source of the calamity called the Dweller, until such time as they destroy their creation‚Äîif they still can. And the reason they do not do so is simply that they continue to love it. The Dweller is in the habit of rising to the surface of the earth and capturing men and women which it holds in an unholy stasis and which in some ways feed it. It increases its knowledge and power constantly, but has a weakness, since it knows nothing of love. The scientist Dr. Goodwin and the half-Irish, half-American pilot Larry O'Keefe, and others, follow it down. Eventually they meet a woman, beautiful and evil, named Yolara, who in essence serves the Shining One, and the 'handmaiden' of the Silent Ones, beautiful and good, named Lakla. Both want O'Keefe and eventually battle over him. There is also a race of very powerful and handsome Polynesian-like 'dwarves' and a race of humanoids whom the Silent Ones developed from a semi-sentient froglike species. There develops a battle between the forces of good and evil with not only the entire world, but perhaps even the existence of good itself at stake. But can the forces of good prevail using fear as a weapon? Or will they have to rely upon love expressed by willing sacrifice?

Reception In its review of The Moon Pool, the New York Times called the novel \\"a shimmering, glittering web of imagination\\" and that \\"the author's energy and fertility of imaginative resources never seem to lessen.\\" Analog magazine considers The Moon Pool to be the author's \\"most celebrated novel\\". Legacy The Moon Pool is sometimes cited as an influence on \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" by H.P. Lovecraft, which may in turn have itself influenced Merritt's later story Dwellers in the Mirage (especially the monster Khalk'ru).\\"Merritt, A[braham]\\" in An H.P. Lovecraft encyclopedia (2001) page 167. In particular, The Moon Pool is partly set on Nan Madol,\\"they had set forth for the Nan-Matal, that extraordinary group of island ruins clustered along the eastern shore of Ponape in the Carolines\\" a location which would, some claim, later inspire Lovecraft's R'lyeh.Appendix: The Cthulhu Project Doug Skinner has highlighted Merritt's work, starting with The Moon Pool, as a major influence on Richard Shaver: Copyright The copyright for this story has expired in the United States and, thus, now resides in the public domain there.

Biography  She was born in St. Petersburg into the family of Dmitry Kapitonovich Bubnov (?‚Äì1914), a bank clerk of lower rank. Her mother Anna Nikolaevna (maiden name Wolfe) (1854‚Äì1940) descended from an old noble Russian family and was distantly related to Alexander Pushkin. From 1903 to 1905, Bubnova studied in the studio of Art Promotion Society. From 1907 until 1914 she studied in the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts. She attended school with the soon-to-be famous Pavel Filonov and her future husband VoldemƒÅrs Matvejs, who was the first Russian researcher of African Art. In 1910 she became a member of the Youth Union and participated in art exhibitions with Mayakovsky, Burlyuk, Larionov, Goncharova, and Malevich. From 1917 until 1922. Bubnova lived in Moscow and worked for the Institute of Artistic Culture with among others Wassily Kandinsky, Robert Falk, Lyubov Popova, Varvara Stepanova and Alexander Rodchenko. In November 1920 she formed the Working Group of Objective Analysis with the last three. This was set up in opposition to what they regarded as Kandinsky's individualistic psychologism. In 1923, she moved to Japan where she lived until 1958. During her time there, Bubnova was mainly painting water-colours and lithographs. She had a significantly large impact on Japanese Arts and was awarded the Japanese Order of the Precious Crown by the Japanese Emperor.

Chem. 66:1077‚Äì1184. \\"Acidity function. \\" Compendium of Chemical Terminology.Rochester, C. H. (1970). Acidity Functions. New York: Academic Press. usually expressed in terms of its ability to donate protons to (or accept protons from) a solute (Br√∏nsted acidity). The pH scale is by far the most commonly used acidity function, and is ideal for dilute aqueous solutions. Other acidity functions have been proposed for different environments, most notably the Hammett acidity function, H0,Hammett, L. P. (1940). Physical Organic Chemistry. New York: McGraw-Hill. for superacid media and its modified version H‚àí for superbasic media. The term acidity function is also used for measurements made on basic systems, and the term basicity function is uncommon. Hammett-type acidity functions are defined in terms of a buffered medium containing a weak base B and its conjugate acid BH+: ::H_0 = {\\\\rm p}K_{\\\\rm a} + \\\\log {{c_{\\\\rm B}}\\\\over{c_{\\\\rm BH^+}}} where pKa is the dissociation constant of BH+. They were originally measured by using nitroanilines as weak bases or acid-base indicators and by measuring the concentrations of the protonated and unprotonated forms with UV-visible spectroscopy. Other spectroscopic methods, such as NMR, may also be used.Cox, R. A.; Yates, K. (1983). Can. J. Chem. 61:2245. The function H‚àí is defined similarly for strong bases: ::H_- = {\\\\rm p}K_{\\\\rm a} + \\\\log {{c_{\\\\rm B^-}}\\\\over{c_{\\\\rm BH}}} Here BH is a weak acid used as an acid-base indicator, and B‚àí is its conjugate base. Comparison of acidity functions with aqueous acidity In dilute aqueous solution, the predominant acid species is the hydrated hydrogen ion H3O+ (or more accurately [H(OH2)n]+). In this case H0 and H‚àí are equivalent to pH values determined by the buffer equation or Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. However, an H0 value of ‚àí21 (a 25% solution of SbF5 in HSO3F)Jolly, William L. (1991). Modern Inorganic Chemistry (2nd Edn.). New York: McGraw-Hill. . p. 234. does not imply a hydrogen ion concentration of 1021 mol/dm3: such a \\"solution\\" would have a density more than a hundred times greater than a neutron star. Rather, H0 = ‚àí21 implies that the reactivity (protonating power) of the solvated hydrogen ions is 1021 times greater than the reactivity of the hydrated hydrogen ions in an aqueous solution of pH 0\\\\. The actual reactive species are different in the two cases, but both can be considered to be sources of H+, i.e. Br√∏nsted acids. The hydrogen ion H+ never exists on its own in a condensed phase, as it is always solvated to a certain extent. The high negative value of H0 in SbF5/HSO3F mixtures indicates that the solvation of the hydrogen ion is much weaker in this solvent system than in water. Other way of expressing the same phenomenon is to say that SbF5¬∑FSO3H is a much stronger proton donor than H3O+.

He was born at Crathorne in 1768, and educated at Ackworth School, Leeds.http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/archive/2008/05/30/Weekend+Times+Feature+%28dst_weekendfeature%29/2308682.A_man_of_considerable_wealth__expensive_tastes_and_great_generosity/  Flounders Folly on Wenlock Edge  His best-known achievement, ironically, was the building of a folly tower, the eponymous Flounders' Folly in South Shropshire near Craven Arms and prominent on the skyline on Callow Hill, the highest point of famous Wenlock Edge. The folly commands extensive views over the surrounding Stretton Hills, Wenlock Edge, the Long Mynd and Clee Hills and even further afield to the Brecon Beacons, Radnor Hills, Malvern Hills and Black Mountains, Wales. The folly was built to celebrate his attaining 70 years, his threescore years and ten, to commemorate his lifelong endeavours and a life well spent and to celebrate the forthcoming marriage of his daughter Mary and the coming of age of his neighbour and associate in Shropshire, Lord Clive.  Family losses  Flounder's life was touched by tragedy with the loss of his first wife Mary Walker (daughter of a Quaker shipbuilder) while giving birth to a premature baby in 1801. They had only married two years previously. Benjamin was 34. The same year his sister died. Mary, his wife, had produced a daughter early in their marriage, also called Mary, who survived to adulthood and to whom Flounders was very close. In 1812, after a very suitable interval, Flounders married for the second time, to Hannah Chapman, another Quaker, and in 1813 a son was produced, but as a result of TB, both mother and infant son were carried off later in 1813.  New endeavours  Flounders became a magistrate for Shropshire. In 1813 he was one of three gentlemen nominated for appointment as High Sheriff of Shropshire but he declined on the grounds he lived permanently in Yarm and would therefore be living up to 180 miles away from Shrewsbury where the courts would be held. He appealed against similar nominations for similar reasons in 1814, 1820 and 1836. He also became JP for the counties of Durham and the North Riding of Yorkshire and, on 29 December 1817 he received a Church of England baptism at the parish church at Stainton, County Durham. He then became a Trustee of a new turnpike Toll road, invested ¬£10,000 in French water stocks, with further investment subsequently ‚Äî attaining massive returns for the time without massive risk. After the death of his mother in 1829 he embarked on the fashionable Grand Tour of Europe with his daughter Mary (now 29), visiting the major cities and sights and spending some time in Rome.  The Folly  On his return from his European travels Benjamin started plans to build a folly. (He had inherited the Culmington estate just north of Ludlow, Shropshire, from his wealthy uncle, one Gideon Bickerdike, another very influential Quaker, who died in 1810.) Benjamin's travels with his daughter and his newer connections in Shropshire especially may have influenced his thinking. At this time he was, through his Ludlow estate, a neighbour of Robert Clive, Earl Craven and Sir (Thomas) Richard Swinnerton-Dyer, Baronet. His agent was instructed to negotiate with several local estates to purchase the land the folly was to be erected on and in 1836 the land was marked out, construction commencing at a time of possibly high levels of unemployment locally; it has been suggested that many local masons, builders and construction workers were happy to be paid to build a folly for an influential man with excellent local connections and the possibility of further contracts resulting. However, many workers were it seems occupied with the building of Ludlow's brand new Assembly Rooms at this time too (finished in 1840). So maybe the folly wasn't meant to be a purely philanthropical undertaking. The fact that Lord Robert Clive came of age in 1840 was possibly part of the plan, as a party to celebrate this event was held at the folly. At around this time Flounders daughter Mary was engaged to marry a Major Arthur Lowe in London. Flounders did not wholeheartedly approve of the Major as Mary ‚Äî his closest relative and family member ‚Äî was to be 'taken from him' by this marriage.  Mary's death  The couple were married but tragedy was to strike Flounders yet again ‚Äî Mary, Flounders' sole heir and his obvious pride and joy, died in 1844, before a home which Flounders was to have funded and given to Mary and Lowe at Culmington was even built. Flounders and Lowe now really fell out ‚Äî Major Lowe wanted Mary buried in a place of his choosing, Flounders wanted his dear daughter buried in the parish churchyard at Yarm in his native North- East, in the plot set out for himself and his family. Lowe had Mary buried there ‚Äî but right against the church wall‚Äîso her father could never be laid next to her. Flounders, ever resourceful, tenacious and more than one step ahead simply bought the land on the other side of the church wall, gave the land to the Yarm church and had the wall diverted and extended to thwart Lowe's scheme. Flounders also moved to disinherit Lowe ‚Äî now his son-in-law and heir. Lowe would have inherited extensive business interests, land and property ‚Äî instead he was left with just an annuity.  Preparations  The stress of what he saw as an unsuitable marriage on his daughter's part, then her tragic (and still childless) death, and the feud with Lowe had taken its toll on aged Benjamin Flounders ‚Äî after 1844‚Äì45 he focused on setting his affairs in order, making sure his by now vast wealth and estate was divided according to his wishes, re-writing his will and taking pains to ensure his faithful estate servants were provided for through bequests of money in lump sums or annuities, that Quaker-founded schools all over the North-East were bequeathed huge funds, benefiting over 20 schools such as Barnard Castle School and the famous Quaker school, Ackworth School, and even small bequests of coal and blankets were made to the poor of Yarm. His house contents went to his housekeeper. Following the death of the last annuitant from his estate in 1884 Yarm was provided with new premises for its Grammar School.  Death & legacy  Flounders died in 1846, aged 77 ‚Äî without any surviving family, and just two years after his beloved daughter Mary ‚Äî so in effect all his wealth went to others; everything he was born into, had worked and endeavoured to achieve over a very long and prosperous life was in effect reinvested for the greater good. Rather than passing (in the greater part anyway) simply to his daughter and her husband, it was spread far and wide benefiting countless school pupils over many, many generations. Flounders would never meet them, but they would undoubtedly thank this man for their education and what it then enabled them and their own loved ones to achieve.

Between Plant City and Zephyrhills, the road is named Paul S. Buchman Highway. North of Zephyrhills, Florida the road is a secret state designation for U.S. Route 301 until the southern terminus of the concurrency with U.S. Route 98 south of Dade City, Florida. Route description=Hillsborough County South end of the \\"temporary\\" truck route through downtown Plant City State Road 39 begins at the SR 60 and County Road 39 in Hopewell. The road enters the Plant City Limits at Trapnell Road. An overhead sign gantry points to a truck detour as the road approaches West Alexander Street, although East Alexander Street continues as a four-lane divided highway toward Jim Johnson Road. It's at this intersection where SR 39 makes a left turn while James L. Redman Parkway continues as State Road 39A. The route continues west until it makes a curve between West Maki Road and Mud Lake Road just before passing by the Florida Heart Institute and running straight north. Between West Ball Street and Sammons Road, SR 39 crosses the CSX Yeoman Subdivision, and later crosses the CSX Lakeland Sudivision, which carries Amtrak's Silver Star line. After those two railroad crossings, the route serves as the last intersection with State Road 574 (Reynolds Street) before that route terminates at U.S. Route 92. SR 39 itself intersects eastbound US 92 (formerly a segment of State Road 566) at Thonotosassa Road (which also contains an intersection with West Oak Avenue on the southwest corner), and then westbound US 92 at West Baker Street (State Road 600). Between Victoria Street and West Spencer Avenue, it curves from north to north-northeast, and then turns straight north again just before the interchange with Interstate 4 (Exit 21), which also contains frontage roads that also extend east to SR 39A. After I-4, Alexander Street makes a slight northwest reverse curve that ends just as the route officially leaves the Plant City Limits south of the intersection with County Road 580, which is not only a county extension of State Road 580 in Tampa and Pinellas County to the west. The next major intersection is the northern terminus of State Road 39A, which is named Paul S. Buchman Highway. From there the road runs along the west side of the CSX Yeoman Subdivision and SR 39 will official become part of Paul S. Buchman Highway at the intersection with County Road 582 (Knights- Griffin Road) in Knights, which likewise is a county extension of State Road 582, but unlike CR 580, crosses over into Polk County. After passing by the Blackwater Ultralight Flightpath, SR 39 and the Yeoman Subdivision both run near a mine just south of the Hillsborough-Pasco County Line. Pasco County and beyond SR 39 was briefly posted in Dade City (2007) In Crystal Springs the road moves away from the Yeoman Subdivision in south of the Hillsborough River, but still remains at a northwesterly direction. Just north of the river, it gradually enters Zephyrhills South where the first major intersection is County Road 535. The road serves as the entrance to the Shady Oaks trailer park and after intersecting Tucker road, meets a wye intersection with U.S. Route 301 and then becomes a hidden route, shared with State Road 41. US 301-SRs 39-41 all enter the City of Zephyrhills and serve as the eastern terminus of State Road 54 at Fifth Avenue. Some maps suggest that it also take SR 54 with it as a hidden route until it reaches Eiland Boulevard. When SR 41 branches off to the northwest and becomes CR 41, SR 39 becomes the sole hidden route for US 301 until the southern terminus of the US 98 (SRs 35-700) multiplex in Clinton Heights, south of Dade City. North of there, it serves as a hidden route for US 98 along with State Road 700, and apparently continues towards northern terminus of the US 98-301 multiplex in Trilacoochee where US 301 runs along SR 35, while US 98-SR 700 runs towards a multiplex with SR 50 in Ridge Manor. In 2007, a resurfacing project of US 98-301 in Dade City led to the exposure of the road's status as State Road 39, as detour signs popped up around downtown. This was also part of an effort to realign US 98-301 to the truck route. SRs 35 & 700 remain hidden state roads in this segment, while mainline US 98-301 follows the former truck route along hidden SR 533. Former segments=Florida SR 39A State Road 39A (SR 39A) is an alternate route within Plant City, and a former segment of SR 39. The route begins at the intersection of West and East Alexander Street, where SR 39 turns from north to west, but this segment is also overlapped by an eastern truck detour of SR 39. A truck detour sign gantry can be found at the southern terminus of State Road 553 (Park Road). A third \\"temporary\\" truck route is signed along Alabama and Wheeler Streets through downtown.Google Street View photos, 2011 At Grant Street, the James L. Redman Parkway becomes South Collins Street, but from there it also shares a concurrency with County Road 574A, until it reaches East Alsobrook Street. Further into the city, SR 39 has a pair of at-grade crossings with the west end of CSX wye between the Yeoman and Plant City Subdivisions at the intersection with Laura Street. After the intersection with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, it crosses the CSX Lakeland Sudivision, which carries Amtrak's Silver Star line, and enters the Downtown Plant City Commercial District where two blocks later intersects eastbound U.S. Route 92 (State Road 600/State Road 574). Here this route also splits as South Collins Street contains only Northbound SR 39A, and then turns onto westbound US 92 (SR 600) two blocks later, only to reunite with southbound SR 39 at North Wheeler Street, two blocks west of there. Simultaneously, Southbound SR 39A continues along North Wheeler Street and then turns left onto eastbound US 92 until it reunites with the northbound route at South Collins Street. From here it enters the Downtown Plant City Historic Residential District which ends just south of the interchange with Interstate 4 (Exit 21), which also contains frontage roads that serve SR 39. North of the interchange with I-4, much of SR 39A runs along the west side of the Yeoman Subdivision as it becomes the Paul S. Buchman Highway. SR 39A itself does not leave Plant City until the intersection with County Road 580, which is not only a county extension of State Road 580 in Tampa and Pinellas County to the west, but as the northern segment of the Eastern Plant City truck route. Florida State Road 39A ends at SR 39 just before that route's intersection with County Road 582 (Knights-Griffin Road) in Knights. Hillsborough and Manatee Counties 75px75px South of SR 60 former State Road 39 continues as County Road 39, through Manatee County into SR 62 near Duette. The road is known as Kickliter Road from SR 62 to State Road 674 in Fort Lonesome, and Plant City-Picnic Road from SR 674 to SR 60. Hernando County 75px In and around Ridge Manor, former SR 39 ran along what is today US 98(SR 700) and old SR 50 to Croom-Rital Road. It then broke away from US 98/SR 50 and was the designation for Croom-Rital Road, a street which runs along what today is the Withlacoochee State Trail, until reaching the unincorporated hamlet of Croom. North of Croom Road, SR 39 went on to Nobleton Road, which is a dirt road that also follows the Withlacoochee State Trail until it becomes the paved Edgewater Avenue, and crosses the trail heading into scenic Nobleton, where it terminates and used to turn west to overlap CR 476.Florida Travel Saver, July‚ÄìSeptember 2001 In Istachatta, another former section exists as County Road 439, then crosses into Citrus County. Citrus County 75px When the road crosses into Pineola in Citrus County, it resumes its designation as County Road 39, however the designation exists in two sections. It winds along the Withlacoochee State Trail, but eventually the trail moves to the northwest. After running across Bradley Lake, it finally terminates at County Road 48. The journey of former SR 39 does not end there though, as it secretly overlaps westbound along CR 48 towards Floral City.Withlacoochee State Trail map (Florida Department of Environmental Protection; Office of Greenways and Trails) North of Floral City, former SR 39 runs along Old Floral City Avenue, where it runs along the Withlacoochee State Trail past County Road 39A, and Fort Cooper State Park, before entering Inverness South. Again between Stoke's Ferry at State Road 200 and US 41 in Citrus Springs, County Road 39 winds along the south side of the Withlacoochee River as the Withlacoochee Trail. Former proposals In the early 20th century, a connection between County Road 48 and SR 200 was planned to run along the west-north side of the Withlacoochee River. This is why there are two sections of CR 39 in Citrus County. It was proposed to end at US 41.

It is located by the famed Hotel Indonesia Roundabout, which gets its name from the hotel and neighbors with Grand Indonesia and Plaza Indonesia shopping malls. Occupying of land, Hotel Indonesia was designed by a Danish architect, Abel Sorensen, and his wife, Wendy Becker. The hotel was inaugurated on August 5, 1962 by Indonesia's first President, Sukarno in preparation for the 1962 Asian Games.

History ;1962 Sukarno appointed architect Abel Sorensen and his wife Wendy to design the hotel to showcase a modern Indonesia. Hotel Indonesia first operated in 1962, inaugurated by the first President Sukarno as the first five star hotel in Southeast Asia to offer international standards. In front of the hotel, located in the heart of the capital, stands the ‚ÄúWelcome Monument‚Äù, intended to welcome the guests who were visiting Jakarta for the 4th Asian Games in 1962. Following the games, the hotel was used by President Sukarno to host state guests, and also official events. ;1960s-70s During its heyday, Hotel Indonesia was the center of many cultural activities. Musical and theatrical performances were routinely staged at the hotel, serving as a launch pad for several renowned Indonesian artists to stardom, notably, among others, Teguh Karya who was the hotel‚Äôs stage manager, Slamet Rahardjo and Rima Melati. In 1969 Hotel Indonesia hosted Miss Indonesia pageant, won by Irma Hadisurya. By the 1970s, the Nirwana Supper Club on the highest terrace of the Ramayana Wing was the venue of choice for Jakarta elites to enjoy a fancy dinner, complete with live entertainment by popular musician, local and international. ;1993 Hotel Indonesia was designated as a cultural heritage site by the Decree of the Governor of Jakarta No. 475 dated 29 March 1993. The decree commanded that the building and all of its historical assets should be well preserved and maintained.Ibid. ;2004‚Äìpresent In 2004, the government decided to completely renovate the hotel, and HI stopped operating that year.

He did so in part to seek a commission from President George Washington as superintendent of construction for the new federal city then being built along the Potomac River (an amateur architect, Blodget would later design the First Bank of the United States building in Philadelphiahttp://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/butowsky2/constitution5.htm), but also to collaborate on a business venture with former U.S. Postmaster General Ebenezer Hazard, who owned a counting house in the city.James, p. 12. Hazard had previously invested in an idea of Blodget's called the Boston Tontine, a sort of early annuity fund that also acted as a lottery for the last surviving investor. It failed, but Blodget and Hazard decided to try again in Philadelphia, then the largest city in North America. They called their new attempt the Universal Tontine Association and this time gave it a 21-year lifespan, after which the association would disband and the surviving investors would split what remained of the fund.James, pp. 12‚Äì14. The Universal Tontine Association also failed to generate the hoped-for interest. In November 1792, its investors met at the Pennsylvania State House (today Independence Hall) to decide what to do with their fund. On November 12, they adopted a proposal to form a general insurance company, to be called the Insurance Company of North America. On November 19, the investors adopted articles of association, giving the company the ability to write fire, life, or marine insurance, though initially the investors would focus solely on marine.James, pp. 16‚Äì18. The company started with $600,000 capital, selling shares at $10 each. Investors subscribed to the first 40,000 shares in eleven days, and on December 10, they met again at the State House to elect directors. The directors held their first board meeting the next day, at Philadelphia's City Tavern. There, they elected merchant and underwriter John Maxwell Nesbitt as president and Hazard as secretary. On December 15, the company opened for business at 119 (now 223) South Front Street. The first policy was issued to Nesbitt's mercantile firm, Conyngham, Nesbitt & Co., for the ship America on its voyage from Philadelphia to Derry.James pp. 16‚Äì18, 21‚Äì22. On December 18, the company petitioned the Pennsylvania legislature for a charter of incorporation. Due to opposition from private underwriters and others, the legislature took over a year to approve the petition; Governor Thomas Mifflin signed the charter incorporating INA on April 14, 1794.James, pp. 36‚Äì39. 1794‚Äì1850 Soon after incorporating, INA entered the field of fire insurance. While Philadelphia already had two fire insurance companies‚ÄîThe Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire (1752) and the Mutual Assurance Company for Insuring Houses from Loss by Fire in and near Philadelphia (1784)‚ÄîINA was different. The existing fire insurance companies, being an outgrowth of volunteer firefighting associations, only insured buildings from loss. INA, with its marine insurance origins, introduced the concept of insuring the contents of the buildings as well.James, pp. 40‚Äì42. INA firemark circa 1801‚Äì1830, as found on a house in the Society Hill neighborhood of Philadelphia, 2013. INA's first fire insurance policy went to William Beynroth on \\"German Dry Goods\\" at his house at 211 High Street (today Market Street) in Philadelphia. INA's first fire mark was a six-pointed star, made with lead and mounted on a wooden shield; in 1796, INA adopted a new mark, of an eagle rising from a rock.James pp. 42‚Äì43. Variations of this image would symbolize the company until the 1950s.William H. A. Carr, Perils: Named and Unnamed (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1967), p. 338. By 1807, INA wrote fire insurance from New Hampshire to Georgia. In October, as the wars in Europe made marine insurance increasingly unprofitable, INA director Alexander Henry proposed extending insurance to Lexington, Kentucky on the nation's frontier. The board of directors appointed Henry to head a committee \\"to consider as to the benefit and propriety of extending insurances against Fire generally to other Cities and Towns in other States beyond what is now customary to take.\\" Henry's committee recommended in favor, and the board authorized INA President John Inskeep to appoint \\"suitable and trusty persons at such places as he shall think advisable to act as Surveyors and Agents of the Company whose duty it shall be to Survey and Certify the situation of all Buildings and property on which insurance is required, at the expense of the persons applying therefor .\\" On January 26, 1808, Inskeep appointed agents to Lexington, Frankfort, and Louisville, Kentucky; Washington, Pennsylvania, near the Ohio border; and Cincinnati.James, pp. 103‚Äì104. This is often credited as the start of the \\"American agency system,\\" and in 1957 a marker was erected on the campus of Transylvania College in Lexington, Kentucky, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the event.Carr, p. 350. 1850‚Äì1942 In 1850, INA bought a property at 232 Walnut Street in Philadelphia to begin the tenure of its longest-serving home office site. Though it demolished and rebuilt the office twice (1851; 1880‚Äì1881), INA operated from 232 Walnut Street as its headquarters until 1925, and kept the location as its local Philadelphia office until 1942.James, pp. 143, 173, 282. Despite the Civil War, INA's agents grew from 40 to 1,300 between 1860 and 1876.James, p. 171. INA appointed its first agents outside of the United States in 1873, when it did so in Canada.Carr, p. 235. In 1897, it appointed the Yang-Tsze Insurance Association, Ltd., as its agents in Shanghai, becoming the first U.S. company to write insurance in China.200 Years of Results (Philadelphia: CIGNA Corporation, 1992), p. 7.

By the 1890s, INA began to write modern inland marine insurance. This included automobile insurance in 1905, though the company soon discovered that automobile owners were more concerned about casualty than property protection. As a fire and marine company, INA could not write casualty insurance, so in 1920 it formed its first true subsidiary, the Indemnity Insurance Company of North America,Merged into INA in 1960. Not related to the active Indemnity Insurance Company of North America, a subsidiary of ACE Limited (as of 2012). to do so.James, pp. 286‚Äì287, 304‚Äì305. As World War I was ending, INA joined other U.S. insurance companies in forming the American Foreign Insurance Association (AFIA)As of 2012, a subsidiary of ACE Limited. to facilitate the growth of U.S. insurance and reinsurance abroad.200 Years of Results, pp. 9‚Äì12. INA left the association in 1921, but continued to expand internationally. By the start of World War II the company had service offices in Canada, China, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, and had agents throughout the world.Carr pp. 235‚Äì237. By the 1920s, INA had outgrown its Philadelphia home office at 232 Walnut Street and constructed a new 16-story office building far to the west of what was then Philadelphia's downtown.James, pp. 280‚Äì281. The Insurance Company of North America Building, at 1600 Arch Street, opened in 1925 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978. 1942‚Äì1967 INA came out of the Great Depression as one of the nation's largest insurance companies, with total assets in December 1941 of about $117 million. According to A.M. Best, it had the largest policyholders' surplus (over $75 million) of any U.S. fire insurance company.‚ÄúInsurance Company of North America,‚Äù Best's Insurance Reports (Fire and Marine Edition), 43rd ed. (New York: Alfred M. Best Company, Inc., 1942), p. 333. In 1942, INA celebrated its 150th anniversary through the book Biography of a Business, a narrative history of the company by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Marquis James and published by Bobbs-Merrill. In the 1940s, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) appointed INA President John A. Diemand to head a committee to consider the subject of ‚Äúmultiple-line‚Äù underwriting: the idea that non-life insurance companies could write any form of non-life insurance, even combining several kinds of insurance coverage in the same policy. At the Diemand Committee's recommendation, the NAIC approved the concept of multiple-line underwriting in 1944.Carr, pp. 155‚Äì159. In 1950, INA invented what became the most successful of all multiple-line policies: the homeowners policy. The homeowners policy combined into one policy various kinds of fire, theft, and liability insurance that previously insurance companies had only offered separately. It was soon INA's most popular and most imitated product. In 1951, the U.S. insurance industry wrote $777,000 in premiums on the policy, all by INA; by 1960, it wrote $750 million.Carr, pp. 263‚Äì265. In the 1950s, INA engaged in two notable marketing ventures: In 1955, it began an eight-year sponsorship of CBS Radio's popular Christmas Sing with Bing programs, starring Bing Crosby.\\"Christmas Sing with Bing,‚Äù North America Fieldman 13(2), February 1956, p. 3. And in 1957, it entered into an agreement with Walt Disney in which INA sponsored and staffed an information booth in the Main Street U.S.A. area of Disneyland (called the \\"Carefree Corner\\"), and hosted a series of ‚ÄúFamily Security and Family Happiness‚Äù conferences at the park.‚ÄúWalt Disney's Magic Kingdom: Disneyland ‚Äì How It Will Work for North America Agents,‚Äù North America Fieldman 14(2), February 1957, p. 3; ‚Äú45 Agents and their Families to Attend,‚Äù North America Fieldman 14(8), October 1957, p. 3. The relationship lasted into the early 1970s. As competition increased from ‚Äúdirect writers‚Äù (companies such as Allstate and State Farm that sold insurance directly to the consumer rather than through independent insurance agents), INA looked for ways to diversify as an insurance company. INA formed a life insurance subsidiary, Life Insurance Company of North America,As of 2012, a subsidiary of CIGNA Corporation. in 1956; in 1965, INA expanded its presence on the U.S. West Coast and also in the workers' compensation field when it acquired the Los Angeles-based Pacific Employers Group (PEG). PEG's flagship, Pacific Employers Insurance Company,As of 2016, a subsidiary of Chubb Limited. was a pioneer in workers' compensation when formed in 1923, and by 1937 was the largest casualty insurance company in California.Carr, pp. 347, 363‚Äì366. 1967‚Äìpresent As the financial services industry emerged in the 1960s, INA's directors sought to diversify further by entering insurance-related and non-insurance businesses. State regulations made this difficult for an insurance company to do, so in 1967 directors formed a holding company named INA Corporation.

Objectives AGILE's mission is to observe gamma-ray sources in the universe. AGILE (Astro rivelatore Gamma a Immagini Leggero) is an Italian high-energy astrophysics mission dedicated to the observation of the gamma-ray Universe. Its very innovative instrumentation is unprecedentedly light (100 kg) and the most compact ever operational for high-energy astrophysics (approximately a cube of about 60 cm size) with excellent detection and imaging capability. Satellite data are collected by the ASI ground station in Malindi (Kenya), then quickly transferred to the Satellite Operations Centre in Fucino, transferred, preprocessed, and stored and analyzed at the ASI Science Data Center (ASDC) in Frascati. In parallel the pre-processed data are transferred at INAF/OAS Bologna for a fast science alert generation, thus assuring a very rapid response to gamma-ray detections, obtained by special quick look analysis programs and coordinated ground-based and space observations. Key scientific objectives of the AGILE Mission include the study of:ASI AGILE * Active Galactic Nuclei * Gamma-Ray Bursts * X-ray and gamma galactic sources * Non- identified gamma sources * Diffuse galactic gamma emissions * Diffuse extra- galactic gamma emissions * Fundamental physics Instrumentation AGILE's instrumentation includes a Gamma Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) sensitive in the 30 MeV ‚Äì 50 GeV energy range, a SuperAGILE (SA) hard X-ray monitor sensitive in the 18‚Äì60 keV energy range, a Mini-Calorimeter (MCAL) non-imaging gamma-ray scintillation detector sensitive in the 350 keV ‚Äì 100 MeV energy range,Scientific Goals and Instrument Performance of the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector AGILE and an Anti-coincidence System (AC), based on a plastic scintillator, to assist with suppressing unwanted background events. The SuperAGILE SA is an instrument based on a set of four silicon strip detectors, each equipped with one-dimensional coded mask. The SA is designed to detect X-Ray signals from known sources and burst-like signals. It provides long-term monitoring of flux and spectral features. MCAL can also effectively detect high-energy radiation bursts in its energy band. Launch and operations AGILE was successfully launched on 23 April 2007, from the Indian base of Sriharikota and was inserted in an equatorial orbit with low particle background. On 23 April 2007, ASI made contact with AGILE; its signals were acquired by the ground station at the Broglio Space Centre near Malindi, Kenya and it was placed in a Sun-pointing mode. Results During its operations AGILE surveyed the gamma-ray sky and detected many galactic and extragalactic sources: AGILE discovered gamma-ray emission from the microquasar Cygnus X-3, detected many bright blazars, discovered several new gamma-ray pulsars, surveyed the Galactic plane with simultaneous hard X-ray/gamma-ray capability, discovered emission up to 100 MeV from Terrestrial Gamma-Ray Flashes. Some transient events detected by AGILE are associated with positions not consistent with a known source (Gamma Ray Burst) and have cosmological origins. Others are due to solar flares, while some are due to Earth atmosphere events (Terrestrial Gamma Flash). The main results of the AGILE satellite are: * Discovery of variable gamma-ray emission from the Crab Nebula: AGILE discovery that the archetypical source of gamma-ray astrophysics is not constant. Very rapid and intense gamma-ray flares from the inner Nebula driven by plasma instabilities. Theoretical particle acceleration models challenged and to be drastically revised. Consequences and broad applications in plasma physics experiments and theoretical studies of particle acceleration. For the discovery of gamma-ray flares from the Crab Nebula the 2012 Bruno Rossi Prize of the American Astronomical Society has been awarded to Marco Tavani and his team. * Resolving the problem of the origin of cosmic- rays: First direct evidence of proton/ion gamma-ray emission by pion emission below 200 MeV in SNR W44. Combined gamma-ray and TeV emission from SNR IC 433 and W28. * Discovery of gamma-ray emission from the black hole system Cygnus X-3: Discovery of extreme particle acceleration preceding relativistic jet plasmoid ejections from the black hole candidate Cyg X-3. Repeatedly detected by AGILE since 2008. First comprehensive survey of all Galactic microquasars by Super-AGILE and AGILE-GRID (Tavani et al., Nature, 462, 620, 2009). * Discovery of TGF emission up to very high energies (100 MeV): Discovery of gamma-ray emission up to 100 MeV from terrestrial flashes associated with intense thunderstorms. Evidence for accelerating potentials larger than 100 MV. Theoretical models of acceleration in lightning discharges to be drastically revised. Significant impacts for atmospheric physics and climate studies. * The supermassive black hole 3C 454.3: Very active and variable blazar since 2007. AGILE first to announce gamma-ray super-flares in 2009 and 2010. The brightest, ever, gamma-ray source in November 2010, almost 7 times more luminous that the Vela pulsar. * Soft gamma-ray pulsars (PSR 1509-58 and others): First post-EGRET gamma-ray pulsar discovered with the AGILE first light in 2007. Unveiling a class of ‚Äúsoft‚Äù gamma-ray pulsar barely detectable below 200 MeV, such as PSR B1509-58. Theoretical constraints on ‚Äúphoton splitting‚Äù in PSR magnetospheres. * Unveiling relativistic particle winds: Nebular gamma-ray emission near the Vela pulsar imaged by AGILE with high resolution. Clear evidence for different accelerated populations of particles. * The brightest massive black hole of the BL Lac class: Detection of the strongest gamma-ray flare from a blazar of the BL Lac class, S5 0716+714 (believed to be driven by black-hole rotation). First theoretical determination of a system near the maximal limit of energy to be extracted from a rotating black hole. * Gamma-ray flaring of the massive black hole Markarian 421: First multifrequency campaign in 2008 including X-ray (Super- AGILE), gamma-ray and TeV observations of the flaring blazar Mrk 421. A key aspect of the AGILE data flow is the fastest gamma-ray alert monitoring system of the world. The overall gamma-ray alert monitoring system of AGILE is compound by two independent pipelines that process the data with different data quality results. The INAF/OAS Bologna pipeline processes the data in the fastest possible way, but it generates alert within 0.5‚Äì1 hour from the time of the last GRID event acquired in orbit. The ASDC pipeline is more accurate because all events are considered during the analysis but the alerts are generated 3‚Äì3.5 hours after.

Hypoalgesia occurs when nociceptive (painful) stimuli are interrupted or decreased somewhere along the path between the input (nociceptors), and the places where they are processed and recognized as pain in the conscious mind. Hypoalgesic effects can be mild, such as massaging a stubbed toe to make it hurt less or taking aspirin to decrease a headache, or they can be severe, like being under strong anesthesia. Hypoalgesia can be caused by exogenous chemicals such as opioids, as well as by chemicals produced by the body in phenomena such as fear- and exercise- induced hypoalgesia. Hypoalgesia can also be associated with diseases, such as CIPA or in less severe cases with diabetes or other diseases associated with hypertension.  Chemical causes =Analgesics Analgesics are a class of biochemicals that cause hypoalgesia. Analgesics can act on both the peripheral and central nervous systems to decrease pain. Certain analgesics also work to decrease the source of the pain by working to decrease swelling and inflammation, as in the case of NSAIDs.Vane, J. (2003). \\"The mechanism of action of anti-inflammatory drugs.\\" Int J Clin Pract Suppl (135): 2. Opioids Opioids refers to a specific group of analgesics ‚Äì including morphine, codeine, and opium ‚Äì that act on opioid receptors, which are located mainly in the central nervous system. Endogenous opioids are types of opioids produced by the body specifically to modulate pain. They include endorphins, enkephalins, dynorphins and endomorphins. These peptides are especially important for modulating pain in response to the environment. These can be released in response to a number of things, including increased blood pressure, pain and danger. It has been found that endogenous opioids are at least partially responsible for phenomena like ‚ÄúRunner's high‚Äù, hypoalgesia in the fight-or- flight response, and even for the analgesic effects of acupuncture therapy.Yang, J., Y. Yang, et al. (2007). \\"Effect of oxytocin on acupuncture analgesia in the rat.\\" Neuropeptides 41(5): 285‚Äì92. In all these cases, there is a certain level of signal processing that occurs in the CNS which leads to the release of these chemicals. Exercise-induced hypoalgesia There has been a great deal of research examining the link between exercise and hypoalgesia. Many studies have shown the direct link between the two by subjecting patients to exercise and rating their pain responses, but despite the great deal of research, the mechanism of action is still poorly understood. It has been shown that the triggering mechanism for the hypoalgesic effects is caused by the increase in blood pressure that accompanies a good workout. The body senses the increased blood pressure, and it is hypothesized that in response, endogenous opioids are released.Koltyn, K. F. and M. Umeda (2006). \\"Exercise, hypoalgesia and blood pressure.\\" Sports Med 36(3): 207‚Äì14. This hypothesis is well supported in human research, and it has been verified that it plays a part, but animal research implies that other mechanisms are also involved Koltyn, K. F. (2000). \\"Analgesia following exercise: a review.\\" Sports Med 29(2): 85‚Äì98. such as the endocannabinoid system.Fuss, J., Steinle, J., Bindila, L., Auer, M.K., Kirchherr, H., Lutz, B., Gass. P. (2015). \\"A runner's high depends on cannabinoid receptors in mice.\\" Proc Natl Acad Sci 112(42): 13105‚Äì08. Fear-induced hypoalgesia Fear induced hypoalgesia is another example of a mechanism controlled by opioids. It is postulated that fear is a defense mechanism that has evolved over time to provide protection. In the case of hypoalgesia, a decreased response to pain would be very beneficial in a situation where an organism's life was at stake, since feeling pain would be a hindrance rather than a help. It has been well documented that fear does cause a decrease in pain response,Rhudy, J. L., J. S. Grimes, et al. (2004). \\"Fear-induced hypoalgesia in humans: effects on low intensity thermal stimulation and finger temperature.\\" J Pain 5(8): 458‚Äì68. however much like the exercise induced hypoalgesia, the exact mechanisms of action are not well understood. Studies have shown that opioids are definitely involved in the process, yet opiates alone do not completely explain the analgesic response.J.M. Lichtman and M.S. Fanselow, \\"Cats produce analgesia in rats on the tail-flick test: naltrexone sensitivity is determined by the nociceptive test stimulus\\". Brain Res 533 (1990), pp. 91‚Äì94.H.S. Hagen and K.F. Green, \\"Effects of time of testing, stress level and number of conditioning days on naloxone sensitivity of conditioned stress-induced analgesia in rats\\". Behav Neurosci 102 (1988), pp. 906‚Äì14. What the other mechanisms of action are is still unknown. Diseases It has been demonstrated that many diseases can cause hypoalgesia. Some diseases, like CIPA, are hereditary disorders where genes essential for the correct functioning of nociceptors no longer work. There are many diseases like this, and they all fall under the category of hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathies. Alternatively, some diseases affect other functions in your body, which can activate the pathways that cause hypoalgesia. This effect happens in people with diabetes and other diseases associated with hypertension.  Hereditary neuropathies  Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN), e.g. CIPA, are hereditary disorders that are characterized by malfunctioning or nonfunctioning pain receptors.Schalka, M. M., M. S. Correa, et al. (2006). \\"Congenital insensitivity-to-pain with anhidrosis (CIPA): a case report with 4-year follow-up.\\" Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod 101(6): 769‚Äì73. Most of these diseases are also associated with decreased temperature sensation as well. In some cases these diseases are also associated with other symptoms like mental retardation and diminished production of sweat and tears. Diseases like this can be very dangerous for the patients, because they are not able to judge what hurts, and therefore when they should stop doing something. A child with the disease might bite their finger clean off before they realized that what they were doing might harm them, or they might leave their hand on a hot stove without ever realizing it was on. These examples support the theory that pain is essential for life, more specifically, survival. Hypoalgesia and hypertension Some studies have shown that hypertension in patients can cause hypoalgesia.Zamir, N., Shuber, E., 1980. \\"Altered pain perception in hypertensive humans\\". Brain Research 201, 471‚Äì74.Edwards, L., C. Ring, et al. (2007). \\"Nociceptive flexion reflex thresholds and pain during rest and computer game play in patients with hypertension and individuals at risk for hypertension.\\" Biol Psychol 76(1-2): 72‚Äì82. Diseases like diabetes, which are associated with hypertension are also associated with hypoalgesia, however this is due to diabetic neuropathy. Just like in Exercise-Induced Hypoalgesia, the increased blood pressure of hypertension works as a signal to the body to release opioids and activate other pain modulation pathways. Also, although the area is not widely studied, there is evidence that this is not the only cause. Diseases may lead to activation of any of these mechanisms, just like diabetes causing hypertension. A full study of the pathways regulating pain is needed.

Early life Hanbury-Tracy was born on 28 December 1778. He was the third son of John Hanbury of Pontypool Park in Monmouthshire. The family derived its wealth from its ownership of the Pontypool Ironworks. He was educated at Rugby School (1790) and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 1 February 1796. Career Hanbury-Tracy was appointed High Sheriff of Gloucestershire for 1800‚Äì01 and High Sheriff of Montgomeryshire for 1804‚Äì05. He was elected to the House of Commons for Tewkesbury in 1807 in the Whig interest, a seat he held until 1812 and again from 1832 to 1837. Hanbury-Tracy served as the Chairman of the Commission to judge the designs for the new Houses of Parliament in 1835. In 1838 Hanbury- Tracy was raised to the peerage as Baron Sudeley, of Toddington in the County of Gloucester. He later served as Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire between 1848 and 1858. Personal life and death Hanbury-Tracy married his cousin the Hon. Henrietta Susanna Tracy, only child of Henry Leigh Tracy, 8th Viscount Tracy by Susannah Weaver, on 29 December 1798. Five days before the marriage he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Tracy. Through this marriage the ancient estate of Toddington Manor in Gloucestershire came into the Hanbury family. Lord Sudeley at first had the original house renovated, but later constructed a new house in Gothic style nearby. Later still in the 1840s he was responsible for the rebuilding of Gregynog Hall in Montgomeryshire. Lady Sudeley died on 5 June 1839. Lord Sudeley survived her by 19 years and died in February 1858, aged 79. He was succeeded in the barony by his son Thomas, who also succeeded him as Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire.

It debuted in 1914.  Publication history  220px When Hershfield had success with a Yiddish character in his comic strip Desperate Desmond, he was encouraged by his editor to create a new strip concerning Yiddishism and Jewish immigrants in the United States. The strip debuted in the New York Journal on February 2, 1914.Abie the Agent at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on March 13, 2012. The strip became popular, and during 1917 two animated cartoons were made. The titles were \\"Iska Worreh\\" (Aug 5) and \\"Abie Kabibble Outwitting His Rival\\" (Sept 23). After the strip dated January 24, 1932, the comic strip went on hiatus, due to a contract dispute between Hershfield and the syndicate, International Feature Service. The strip resumed in 1935 with the King Features Syndicate, and ran until 1940. The Sunday page included a topper. This was called Phooy Fables in January 1926, Dictated But Not Read from February until the end of 1926, and Homeless Hector from 1927 until the hiatus in 1932. Characters and story Abraham Kabibble, known as Abie the Agent, was the first Jewish protagonist of an American comic strip. Abie‚Äôs humorous caricature was a rebuttal of some of the Jewish stereotypes in caricatures, and represented a moderately successful middle-class immigrant. Abie and his friends had many typical Jewish characteristics, such as their names or their use of Yiddish words and accents, they also lacked many of the negative or malicious elements, such as exaggerated physical traits, found in the depictions of Jews from this time. Abie was in many ways indistinguishable from other Americans, and he was a prime example of the belief in the integration of German Jews into U.S. society. During 1917, the character enlisted in the Army to help the U.S. forces in World War I. The character lost many of his more typical Jewish characteristics over the decades, showing his successful integration but also slowly diminishing the particular features of this comic strip. The comic was produced by a Jewish artist, but can be considered discriminatory since it arguably only tried to promote the assimilation of Jews as Americans, at the same time distinguishing them from other ethnicities like Mexicans or African Americans who were often depicted negatively. That, however, was the focus of the strip.  In popular culture  An indication of the strip's popularity was the reference to ‚ÄòAbe Kabibble‚Äô in the 1930 Marx Brothers movie Animal Crackers.

The municipality has access to the Tauern Railway line at M√ºhldorf-M√∂llbr√ºcke station. History The settlement was first mentioned in an 1177 deed; the name M√ºhldorf referred to the numerous mills in the area. The village probably arose around an older salt mine, once owned by the Benedictine monks of Millstatt Abbey, which soon was abandoned, however. In 1844 a loden cape production was established, the facility exists up to today. The present-day municipality was constituted in 1850.

Life  Hildebrandt was the son of the art professor Edmund Hildebrandt (1872‚Äì1939) and his wife Ottilie, n√©e Schlesinger (1872‚Äì1952). He studied theology in Berlin, Marburg, and T√ºbingen (1926‚Äì1930). During his time in Berlin, he became a close friend of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. In 1930, he was awarded a licentiate (comparable to a Ph.D.) by the University of Berlin; his first book (EST: Das Lutherische Prinzip) was based on his doctoral dissertation. Hildebrandt subsequently served for the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union his probationary time (Vikariat) in Dobrilugk and at the in Sch√∂neberg (a locality of Berlin), and his first posting as an assistant pastor in Kleinmachnow; he was ordained as a pastor in Berlin on June 18, 1933. Since his mother was of Jewish descent, he was affected by the introduction of the so-called Aryan Paragraph in some of the Protestant Churches in Germany after the Nazis came to power in 1933. Hildebrandt resigned from his post as a sign of protest against this church measure and left Germany to join his friend, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was pastor to the German congregation in London at the time. He returned to Germany after three months, having been asked by Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller to help him build up the Pfarrernotbund, an organisation set up to help pastors affected by the infamous Arierparagraph. Shortly after Niem√∂ller's arrest and subsequent detention until the end of World War II, Hildebrandt was himself arrested. Friends managed to procure his release, and he left once again for England, now in permanent exile. In subsequent years, Hildebrandt helped build up the German-speaking Protestant congregation in Cambridge, and worked for a number of church-related projects, including German-language broadcasts on the BBC. At the beginning of the war, he was interned for several months, but was released upon the intervention of his friend, Bishop George Bell of Chichester. Bell had a close relationship to both Bonhoeffer and Hildebrandt (he referred to them as 'my two boys'). In spite of his close relationship with Bell, Hildebrandt could not bring himself to join the Church of England, and become a Priest within that church, since that would have required renewed ordination by an Anglican bishop ‚Äì something that Hildebrandt could not accept since it would have implicitly declared his ordination in Germany as invalid. Hildebrandt subsequently associated more and more closely with Methodism, and eventually became a minister in that church. He began to study the theological roots of Methodism in the work of John Wesley, and developed a theological perspective on Wesley (and Methodism in general) as a development of sound Reformation theology. He started work as a Methodist pastor in Romsey Town, south of Cambridge (1946), and later in Edinburgh (1951‚Äì1953). Hildebrandt married Nancy Hope Wright in 1943; the couple had three children; David, Ruth and Esther. Having made every effort for a number of years to find an academic post in England, including a further doctorate at the University of Cambridge (1941), Hildebrandt was eventually called to a teaching position at Drew University, a Methodist university in the USA, where he taught Biblical Theology from 1953 to 1967. During this time, he was asked to represent the World Methodist Council as an observer at the Second Vatican Council. He also received an honorary doctorate from the Kirchliche Hochschule Berlin during this period (1960). Returning to Scotland in 1968, Hildebrandt soon left the Methodist Church as a result of then current union talks with the Church of England, which would have required him once again to submit to renewed ordination. He joined the (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland, and was an active pastor and hospital chaplain in Edinburgh until he died in 1985. He was survived by his wife and three children. Nancy died on 12 July 2008, aged 89. David died on 16 June 2002.  Theology  Hildebrandt became well known in Methodist circles on account of his work on the theology and hymns of John and Charles Wesley. In contrast to Eberhard Bethge, Bonhoeffer's closest friend from later years, Hildebrandt deliberately eschewed the debate about Bonhoeffer's theology that ensued from the 1950s onwards.

Early life and Brotherhood Joche Albert was born to a Christian family, and upon baptism was given the name \\"Andrew\\". He entered the Marist Brothers juniorate in Beijing in 1921. He went on to make his first vows in 1931, and his perpetual profession in 1935, whereupon he took the name Joche Albert. Then, from 1940 to 1944, he studied at Fu Jen Catholic University, where he was a keen student of Chinese literature, while in his free time he would stud both French and English until he mastered them both. Living under the PLA He then moved to Che Foo, where he enjoyed teaching Science until the PLA conquered that city, forcing him to study Marxism in the makeshift university of Laiyang. In March 1946 he fled Che Foo, and subsequently found himself permanently on the move, not only protecting himself, but also working hard, far and wide to ensure the safety and the strength of the many Catholic communities in the increasingly oppressive state. He moved to Qingdao, then to Shanghai, before moving to Shantung (Chinese Tibet) and founding Ming Teh Secondary School there. But in February 1949, he returned to Shanghai, then travelled to Chongqing, and moved again to Zhejiang, where he was assigned as the superior. Oppression and martyrdom Having become the Superior at Sichang, Brother Joche became a key player for the Church in the region. He often found himself the spokesperson on behalf of the diocese, making him a target as he increasingly became the public face of the Church. As the director of the Catholic College of Zhejiang, he often denounced the actions of the PLA and the teachings of Communism in general. However, after the \\"Liberation\\" of Sichang, on Passion Sunday, 26 March 1950, and his re-education with many colleagues, he found his criticism had to be less marked, although he was adamant and unashamed when it came to defending God or the faith. On 14 December 1950, Brother Albert was called to court together with another Marist Brother and the lay leader of the local Catholic Action. The interview was an attempt to get these influential leaders to profess subscription to the Three Autonomies, that they may become assets in the process of winning Catholic people over to Communism. Brother Albert categorically refused, and so was incarcerated in the 6 January 1951 for conspiracy against the state. Brother Albert maintained his hardy faith despite his circumstances. It is said that while imprisoned Brother Albert still maintained his generosity . A Protestant person released from prison told of how he shared everything he had, including his habit. Also whilst in jail, he was still allowed to receive Holy Communion, and had indicated to his friends and supporters on the outside that he would think closely of them during the morning Angelus. On the morning of 21 April 1951 Brother Joche- Albert Ly was executed by the PLA, together with another 24 other Christians, near the ramparts of Sichang. It is said that the bells of the Angelus were ringing as the shots rang out . See also * Chinese Martyrs * Roman Catholicism in China  External links  * Br.

Geography Market square Oberdrauburg is near the K√§rntner Tor (Carinthian Gate), a narrow place in the Drava Valley between the Gailtal Alps in the south and the Kreuzeck group of the Hohe Tauern range in the north, where the river crosses the border from East Tyrol to Carinthia. The town is about east of Lienz; in the west it shares a border with the Tyrolian municipality of Nikolsdorf. The municipal area includes the cadastral communities of Flaschberg and Zwickenberg. Oberdrauburg is on the Drautal-Stra√üe highway (Bundesstra√üe B 100) running from Spittal an der Drau to Lienz. Here the Pl√∂ckenpass-Stra√üe B 110 highway branches off, leading via the Gailberg Saddle mountain pass to K√∂tschach- Mauthen in the Gail Valley. Rail transport is available at the Oberdrauburg Station of the Drautalbahn (Drava Valley Railway) line. The name of the town corresponds with the town of Dravograd (Unterdrauburg) in Slovenia, where the Drava crosses the border from Carinthia to the historic Styria region. History Hohenburg Castle Archaeological findings indicate a continuous settlement of the area throughout Celtic and Roman times. Oberdrauburg Castle was first mentioned in a 1240 as a possession of the Carinthian duke Bernhard von Spanheim. During the 13th century a settlement arose beneath the castle near the branch-off of the Gailberg Saddle road. In 1292 Oberdrauburg was held by the Meinhardiner House of Gorizia at Lienz. In 1308 it appears as a fief of the Archbishopric of Salzburg. It received market rights in 1325 and further benefited from its convenient location at the crossroads. From 1385 it was held by the Counts of Ortenburg and, with the Ortenburg possessions, it was inherited by Count Hermann II of Celje in 1418. Upon the death of Hermann's grandson Count Ulrich II of Celje in 1456, it passed to the Austrian House of Habsburg. Archduke Ferdinand I of Austria granted the estates to his treasurer Gabriel von Salamanca in 1524.

The gay market is estimated to be five to ten percent of the overall adult market. Gay pornographic films trace their origins to the Athletic Model Guild, founded in Los Angeles in 1945, which produced photographs and still images later turned into films and porn loops.\\"Hub of all that's hot: San Francisco ‚Äì surprise! ‚Äì has surpassed Los Angeles as the capital of the gay adult entertainment industry\\". Wyatt Buchanan. San Francisco Chronicle. February 23, 2007. The modern roots of films can be traced to the early 1970s when movies were shown in New York theaters. Over time the \\"heterosexual adult industry blossomed in Southern California\\" and often included gay content. Several major shifts affected the gay porn industry: the advent of home video when anyone could purchase a movie to view in private; the AIDS pandemic, which compelled models to be extremely healthy-looking and caused safer sex depictions to become the standard on- screen; and the emergence of the Internet allowing live streaming, social networking and amateur pornography to change how stars are discovered, marketed and even viewed as the films do not have to be copied, packaged and delivered, although those options remain. The list includes male actors in gay pornographic films who may be notable for their gay pornography and those who may be notable for other reasons or both. The listing is alphabetic by first name. Some performers have many pseudonyms and stage names (indicated here by a.k.a.). Multiple pseudonyms are utilized for a variety of reasons including legal constraints, the appearance of having more actors working at a studio, an actor's wishing to disguise how many films he is working on or that he is doing work for another studio, etc. The men listed here are known to have appeared in a gay porn film; however, this does not necessarily mean they are gay‚Äîsee gay-for-pay. Many of these men have also appeared in other forms of pornography, such as pornographic magazines. They may have appeared in other genres of pornography, including bisexual and heterosexual porn. This list does not include performers who have appeared in other forms of pornography unless they have also appeared in a gay porn film. Many of these performers have been recognized with annual awards in various categories from \\"Best actor\\" to \\"Best top\\", \\"Best versatile performer\\" and even \\"Best non-sexual performance\\". There are also international porn awards as well as discontinued awards that apply to many of these performers and actors. With the increasing use of the Internet for live-streaming of movies and video clips, as well as the use of social-networking websites and blogs, amateur porn and niche genres have increasingly competed against the major gay pornography film companies.

Geography M√∂ll Valley with Obervellach (left) and Tauern Railway line The settlement is situated in the valley of the M√∂ll river, on the southern slope of the High Tauern mountain range, where the Tauern Railway line descends from neighbouring Mallnitz and the southern Tauern Tunnel portal. The municipal area comprises the cadastral communities of Obervellach proper, Pfaffenberg, Lassach, and S√∂briach. History The settlement of Velach was first mentioned in a 10th-century deed issued by the Bishop Abraham of Freising (d. 993/94), a Bavarian missionary among the East Alpine Slavs in the Duchy of Carinthia (former Carantania), known for the Slovene Freising manuscripts. The name is probably derived from Slavic bela (\\"white\\"). The local church was mentioned as 'Freising basilica' in 1072, it later became the seat of a deanery of the Salzburg archbishops. The traditional gold and silver mining area from the 12th century onwards was a possession of the comital House of Gorizia (G√∂rz); in 1164 their ministeriales took their residence at Falkenstein Castle high above the valley. The Counts of Gorizia also held nearby Groppenstein Castle, first mentioned in 1254. Obervellach market rights were attested in 1256. After an armed conflict over the inheritance of late Count Ulrich II of Celje, in which the Count Leonhard of Gorizia and his brother John II were defeated by the forces of Emperor Frederick III, the area of Obervellach in 1460 finally was incorporated into the Inner Austrian possessions of the ruling House of Habsburg. Mining authority building The settlement remained an important mining area; the Habsburg emperor Maximilian I himself confirmed the market rights and in 1509 decided on Obervellach as the seat of the Inner Austrian mining authority (Oberbergmeisteramt). The present-day Late Gothic church building was built around 1500, it was consecrated by Bishop Berthold of Chiemsee. A notable Renaissance altar was installed about 1520 at the behest of the Imperial captain Christoph Frankopan (Frangipani), brother-in-law of the Salzburg prince-archbishop Matth√§us Lang von Wellenburg; it includes several pieces by the Dutch painter Jan van Scorel (1495‚Äì1562). In the 17th century, gold and silver deposits were progressively depleted, they were replaced by new copper mines. When the travel writer Joseph Kyselak toured the region in 1825, he found Obervellach a still prosperous settlement. The Obervellach municipality was established in 1849, it then also comprised neighbouring Mallnitz, Flattach, and the cadastral community of Penk (part of the Rei√üeck municipality since 1973), which all became independent in 1896. The Tauern Railway line was inaugurated in 1909, with a station near the village of Kaponig high above the Obervellach centre, which was accessible by a cable car until 1975. The station was finally closed in 1999, today trains stop at the Tauernschleuse car shuttle station in Mallnitz (Mallnitz-Obervellach).

The original building, Bourn Hall, is about 400 years old. Since becoming a medical centre, it has been greatly extended.  History  Bourn Hall Clinic was founded in 1980 by IVF pioneers Mr Patrick Steptoe, embryologist Jean Purdy and Professor Robert Edwards, who were responsible for the conception of Louise Brown, the world's first IVF or test- tube baby in 1977. Since its foundation the clinic has assisted in the conception of over 10,000 babies. Following the death of Patrick Steptoe in 1988, Peter Brinsden was appointed Medical Director in March 1989. Bourn Hall Clinic is one of five fertility centres selected by the NHS East of England Specialised Commissioning Group to provide treatment to patients in the region. As of 1 May 2009, childless couples in Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire will be able to access up to three cycles of IVF, plus a further three frozen embryo transfers. A breakthrough that occurred in Bourn Hall‚Äôs early days was the application of cryobiology to IVF, allowed embryos to be frozen for transfer at a later date. The first \\"frozen babies\\" were born in 1984. Bourn Hall also led the way in offering in vitro fertilisation surrogacy. They treated the first couple in the United Kingdom in 1988 and the first IVF surrogacy child was born in 1989. The world‚Äôs first baby born as a result of directly injecting a single sperm into the centre of an oocyte was conceived at Bourn Hall. Since this birth in 1992 \\"intracytoplasmic sperm injection\\" or ICSI has been adopted by IVF clinics around the world. More recently, Bourn Hall pioneered the use of blastocyst culture, where the embryo is grown for up to five days prior to implantation. This increases the chances of IVF success. In 2009, Bourn Hall acquired the former ISIS Fertility Centre in Colchester, Essex which has enabled more convenient access to both NHS and self funded fertility treatments for patients from the Essex and Suffolk regions. In 2010 Bourn Hall Clinic celebrated the award of the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine to co-founder Professor Robert Edwards. A plaque was unveiled at the Clinic in July 2013 by Louise Brown and Alastair MacDonald - the world's first IVF baby boy - commemorating Steptoe and Edwards. The plaque missed out Jean Purdy who had been the person who chose Bourn Hall, was a co-founder of the clinic and an equal partner in developing IVF. In 2018, to mark the 40th anniversary of IVF, the clinic unveiled an additional memorial to Jean Purdy, the \\"world's first IVF nurse and embryologist. Co-founder of Bourn Hall Clinic\\". The current Science Director, appointed in January 2018, is Martyn Blayney MSc, DIP RCPathhttps://www.bournhall.co.uk/clinic/team/martyn-blayney/  Controversy  In March 2008 the British press reported the case of a woman who forged her estranged husband's signature on a consent form for IVF treatment at Bourn Hall Clinic to use frozen embryos that the couple had created together. The woman then went on to have two children without her husband's knowledge or consent. Fertility clinics, by law, must obtain written consent from the male in a relationship, but do not require him to attend the clinic in person. The man only found out that he was a father when one of the children became seriously ill and he was contacted by a relative. The husband sought legal advice concerning the matterThe Sunday Times, 2 March 2008 but Bourn Hall was not found to be liable. The law has since changed to require photographic identification as well as a signature to ensure that the man authorising the use of frozen embryos is indeed the father.

Biography His father Peter was the grandson of John of Lusignan and second wife Alice of Ibelin. Phoebus was legitimized by Pope Martin V in 1428, along with his cousin Guy de Lusignan, illegitimate son of King Janus of Cyprus. Married to an unknown woman, he was the father of one son and one daughter. His son Hugh of Lusignan (d. after 1468), Lord of Menico and Acaqui, was married firstly to ... Babin and secondly to Isabeau Placoton, with whom he had two daughters: *Isabella of Lusignan, married to Very Embriaco de Giblet, Lord of Makrassika. *Lucr√®ce of Lusignan, married to Olivier de Flatre. His daughter El√®onore, also Leonor (in Portuguese), of Lusignan (d. Lisbon, ca 1475, and buried there) also married twice.

Her second marriage was before 1459 as second wife to Vasco Gil Moniz, with whom she had one son, Febo (or Febos) Moniz de Lusignan or Febo (or Febos) Moniz. Eleonore was said to have come from Aragon as a Dame of Isabella of Urgell, Duchess of Coimbra, wife of Infante Pedro, Duke of Coimbra. She most likely met her husband when he went to Cyprus in the company of John of Portugal, who was marrying Queen Charlotte of Cyprus. Since he died at the same place and about the same time of his cousin Queen Charlotte it can be assumed that when she was deposed by her brother he chose not to endorse him and instead accompanied her to her exile and died there. His daughter went to Portugal back with her husband either when his master Charlotte's first husband was murdered or, after deciding to stay after that event, when his master's widow was deposed and at the same time Phoebus left Cyprus, returning to his country instead of going to Rome with him.

He has since become involved in a number of Pagan organisations, including the Fellowship of Isis, and has participated in the interfaith movement. He has written a number of books on the subject of Wiccan theology and history. Biography= Early Life: 1931‚Äì1956  Lamond was born an only child and when he was only two years old his parents divorced, leaving him to live with his maternal grandparents. After the start of World War II, his grandmother, who was of Jewish ethnicity, took him to live in Switzerland, which was then one of the only neutral countries in Europe. Lamond was raised in a relatively free religious environment and was not forced to follow any religion. His grandmother had repeated on numerous occasions that \\"all religious dogmas are lies!\\". However, she still sent him to Protestant catechism to learn Biblical history when he was thirteen. She believed it necessary for any educated European.Lamond 2004. p. 3-4. He would later remark that whilst he admired Jesus Christ, he did not think him any more holy than any other good men in history ‚Äì and he disliked the God that was presented in the Old Testament. Nonetheless, he received his Christian confirmation at fifteen and spent his next two years at an Anglican boarding school, in England. It was there he realised his beliefs did not agree with those of Christianity and ceased identifying as a Christian.Lamond 2004. p. 3-4. From here, Lamond went to Cambridge University, where he became involved in the cause for European federalism and joined the Progressive League. In 1954, he first partook of sexual intercourse with a local girl, Mary, with whom he had fallen in love, an experience that he said allowed him to encounter the goddess Aphrodite, who he felt as a presence near to him. The two planned to be married, but the engagement was ended after opposition from Mary's parents.Lamond 2004. p. 5-6.  Involvement with Wicca: 1957‚Äìpresent  After his experience with Aphrodite, and his lifetime belief in pantheism, Lamond became further interested in paganism, and it was through this that he read Gerald Gardner's book Witchcraft Today (1954). Lamond wrote to Gardner, who invited him to meet him at his flat in Holland Park, London. The two became friends, and Lamond was introduced to other members of the Bricket Wood coven. They invited him to join them, and he was initiated, alongside another new figure, who has remained nameless, at the Sabbat of Imbolc.Lamond 2004. p. 7. In 1959, Lamond met his future wife, Gillian, and they moved into a flat together in September of that year. In August 1960 they married, and a party was held by coven member Jack Bracelin at Fiveacres nudist club, where the marriage was blessed by Lois Bourne, the coven's High Priestess.Lamond 2004. p. 37. The historian Ronald Hutton remarked that this was the first known example of a Wiccan marriage ceremony.Hutton 1999. p. 325. From October 1961 to August 1964, the Lamonds' lived in Greater Manchester, where Frederic worked for a computer company, and they only circled with the Bricket Wood coven on occasional visits back to London.Lamond 2004. p. 37. In October 1965, Fred was posted to work in Prague to lead a technical support group, and whilst Gillian at first went with him, she returned to England in 1966 to care for their daughter, who had been diagnosed as being deaf. In April 1967 Lamond too returned home.Lamond 2004. p. 39. In 1981, Lamond met with the controversial American Wiccan Aidan Kelly in California, and seven years later Lamond once again visited Kelly, taking part in a ritual with Kelly's coven.Lamond 2004. p. 65. In July 1986, Lamond's first wife, Gillian, died.Lamond 2004. p. 39. After this, Lamond joined two different occultic groups, the Companions of the Rainbow Bridge, and the Fellowship of Isis. In winter 1993, Lamond and his new wife Hildegard visited Lamond's father in Austria. In August 1994 they moved to Austria permanently. Lamond met very few neopagans in the country, but in 2000 he started meeting a few at a monthly pub moot, and in 2003 initiated three Austrian women into the craft.Lamond 2004. p. 60.

He is best known for his minimalist figuration and use of intense, unmodulated and often dissonant palette. With the exception of his juvenile period of geometric abstraction, he remained loyal to figuration throughout his whole career. Exceptionally prolific, he worked in various techniques and was equally skilful in using high-polished metal, polychromous wood, enamel, terracotta or polyester to create his sculptures, reliefs and mobiles. Biography Vasko Lipovac was born on June 14, 1931, in ≈†kaljari, a small coastal settlement near Kotor in Montenegro. He was the youngest of five children in a very harmonious family of a prosperous merchant and a shipping agent Spasoje Lipovac and Antica Lui, the daughter of a respectable landowner Maksimilijan Lui. He attended Real Grammar School in Kotor, where his drawing teacher was Mato ƒêuranoviƒá (1895‚Äì1973), the painter who inspired his students with the bright, shiny colors of his works. After graduating from the secondary school, he moved to Zagreb, Croatia in 1950 and enrolled in the Academy of Applied Arts. He initially chose sculpture, in the class of Kosta Angeli Radovani, but during his second year (1951/1952) he switched to painting, where his mentor became ≈Ωeljko Hegedu≈°iƒá. It is worth mentioning that during this period of the early 1950s, many future prominent artists attended Zagreb Academy of Applied Arts, such as Zlatko Bourek, Jagoda Buiƒá, Ante Sony Jakiƒá, Zvonimir Lonƒçariƒá, Mladen Pejakoviƒá, Ordan Petlevski and Pavao ≈†talter. After graduation, from 1955 to 1959 he attended the Master's Workshop of professor Krsto Hegedu≈°iƒá. This postgraduate study gave many talented young visual artists much needed freedom and opportunity to explore and use their artistic sensibility. In 1959 he married Milena Matas, and they later had three sons. He spent most of the 1960 in the army, and upon returning to Zagreb he spent a year (1964‚Äì1966) as an art editor assistant in the magazine ‚ÄúChemistry in industry‚Äù, which was the only full-time job he ever had. Since 1967, Vasko Lipovac lived and worked in Split, Croatia, where the Mediterranean climate inspired him to fulfill his poetic vision, and to create numerous works. Four thematic units have been detected in the work of Lipovac, namely the Mediterranean, sports, the sacral and erotic. During the whole course of his active life he carried within himself the images of the native landscape of Boka Kotorska and the rich cultural heritage of his home town, while his education in Zagreb provided him with an access to the essential experiences of modernism and figurative autonomy, especially thanks to Kosta Angeli Radovani. So in his work, apart from the early abstract phase, he tried to affirm the contemporary anthropomorphic and associative sculpture and figurative painting, succeeding in evoking the figures and ambiances of recognizably Mediterranean descent. No matter how stylized, that figure is full of life, just like a human being who works, thinks, feels... He was intrigued by the idea of integrating art with architecture, and especially integration of art into workspace, so he collaborated with numerous architects. Among his most prominent are the collaborations with Bernardo Bernardi (hr), Julije De Luca (hr), Vjekoslav Ivani≈°eviƒá, Dinko Kovaƒçiƒá (hr), Lovro Perkoviƒá (hr), Jerko Ro≈°in (hr), and Ivan Vuliƒá. Exceptionally prolific and equally skillful in various techniques and using wide range of materials, high-polished metal, polychromous wood, enamel, terracotta or polyester to create his sculptures, reliefs and mobiles, his work encompasses many different art forms (drawing, painting, sculpture, printmaking, design, illustration as well as set and costume design). As a result, he had almost 100 solo and over 200 group, juried, problem, conceptual, and important invitational exhibitions in Croatia as well as abroad during his life. He gained a great deal of deserved popularity with the wider public and earned an equally high esteem and recognition with the professional critics and received over twenty awards and honors for his sculptures, paintings, graphics, illustrations and public monuments. In May 2006, ‚ÄúSlobodna Dalmacija‚Äù awarded him with the lifetime achievement award. Vasko Lipovac died on July 4, 2006.

William Walls (2 August 1819 ‚Äì 27 September 1893) was a Scottish lawyer, industrialist and Dean of Guild of Glasgow. The son of John Walls and Elizabeth (n√©e Flett), he was born in Kirkwall, Orkney, and trained as a lawyer in Edinburgh before founding whale oil merchants and refiners William Walls & Co in 1847, in Glasgow. Walls served as a town councilor of Glasgow from 1868‚Äì1886, latterly acting as Treasurer. He is credited as helping to secure the post of Town Clerk for his fellow Orcadian Sir James David Marwick who was to largely influence and direct the lines of Glasgow's development in the second half of the 19th century. Walls was instrumental in developing Loch Katrine as a reservoir to provide clean water for Glasgow's burgeoning population and, among other awards, was presented with a medal by the Corporation and citizens in recognition of his services in 1859. He was appointed Dean of Guild of Glasgow in 1887 and continued in this position until his retirement in 1889. His company, William Walls & Co, played an instrumental role in the substantial growth of Glasgow as one of Britain's leading industrial cities and by the 1860s was a major local employer. The Maryhill works grew exponentially and this sometimes brought Walls into conflict with early anti-pollution legislation. In 1874 he was charged with contravening the smoke section of the Glasgow Police Act, 1862, but the case was later dismissed. A caricature in The Bailie portrays Walls comforting a policeman seemingly overcome by the effects of smoke-inhalation, an image which is also strongly redolent of his power and influence as a leading industrialist and burgh councilor. Walls married Sarah Cole, daughter of Thomas Cole, in 1847, and was succeeded as senior partner of William Walls & Co in 1889 by his eldest son William Andrew Walls. Walls Street in Glasgow is named after him.

It was established in October 1945 by the Jewish Agency and operated for some ten months, until August 1946.Jewish Agency for Israel, History of the Jewish Agency for Israel Retrieved on 27 April 2012 The alliance coordinated acts of sabotage to undermine the British authority in Mandatory Palestine. The Zionist Movement had high hopes for the Labour administration elected in Britain after the Second World War. The latter, however, continued to apply the policies laid down in the White Paper of 1939 which included restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine. Negotiations began for the formation of the movement in August 1945 at the behest of Haganah leaders Moshe Sneh and Israel Galili. At the end of October of the same year, an agreement was signed forming the \\"Jewish Resistance Movement\\".Eric Silver, Begin, A Biography. 1984, . pages 62‚Äì64. The leadership of the new movement included four representatives: Two from the Haganah (Sneh and Galili), a representative of the Irgun (Menachem Begin) and a representative of Lehi (Nathan Yellin Mor). In order to coordinate the activities of the groups, a civilian committee known as \\"Committee X\\" was made up of six members, representatives of the various political stream, (including Levi Eshkol). The operations board, who approved operations plans, was made up of Yitzhak Sadeh (of the Palmach), Eitan Livni (of the Irgun) and Yaakov Eliav (1917‚Äì1985) (of the Lehi). During the movement's existence, eleven major operations were carried out, eight of them by the Palmach and Haganah, and three by the Irgun and Lehi, as well as many smaller operations. Notable among these were: * The release of 200 members of Aliyah Bet from the detention camp in Atlit * The bombing of railroads and train stations on the Night of the Trains * The bombing of dozens of bridges around the country in the Night of the Bridges * Attacks on British police stations * Bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, where 91 people were killed, including 28 British citizens, 41 Palestinian Arabs, 17 Palestinians Jews, two Armenians, a Russian, an Egyptian and a Greek. In August 1946, in the wake of the King David Hotel bombing, Chaim Weizmann, president of the WZO appealed to the movement to cease all further military activity until a decision on the issue had been reached by the Jewish Agency. The Jewish Agency backed Weizmann's recommendation to cease activities, a decision reluctantly accepted by the Haganah, but not by the Irgun and the Lehi. The JRM was dismantled and each of the founding groups continued operating according to their own policy.Horne, Edward (1982).

Biography Not Enough Rope began in 1994 over a few beers at the Kalamunda Hotel in Perth, Western Australia. The initial idea was to get together, play a few songs and tell a few yarns. The group soon grew from three to five and it was regular rehearsals in the original bass player's (Adrian Conti) orchard packing shed.Sunday Times, 1995. Soon the band were performing regular gigs, supporting Things of Stone and Wood in 1995 and even finding Jewel joining them on stage for an impromptu gig, after she had performed a major live show elsewhere that evening.Roped In, 2000. The name Not Enough Rope arose by accident, while rehearsing at Keally's garage, the band was brainstorming a name and eventually agreed on Not Enough Rope. It eventuated from a makeshift rope clothesline that had fallen down due to the end fraying and breaking, the band deciding that the name reflected their sound and style. Even likened to The Pogues in their early days, there was something in their music that, if not touching the heart, it imbued a wistful and melancholy feeling with a touch of sweetness.Sunday Times, 1996. Their debut EP was I'll Tell You When I See You in 1996, followed by their debut album Fingerpistol and My Way EP (both in 1998) and Paying Off My Radials album in 2001, which features a cover of The Triffids' \\"Wide Open Road\\".

Originally released alongside Devil May Cry and Devil May Cry 2 the novels act as preludes, with the epilogue of the novel leading into the opening scene of the game. In 2006, Tokyopop released English language editions of the novels, translated by Paul Cheng and Gemma Collinge and adapted into English by Ethan Russell. Devil May Cry Volume 1 thumb150pxrightDevil May Cry Volume 1 Pages: 206 Devil May Cry Volume 1 spans from the death of Dante's mother Eva until the beginning of the first Devil May Cry video game, though evidence suggests that the story may also take place before Devil May Cry 3 as well. Series creator Hideki Kamiya was able to work closely with Goikeda during the development of the novel, stating that his depiction of Dante and Goikeda's depiction are very similar.\\"Because I had free time, I was really able to really get on the same page as Mister Goikeda and offer my input from start to finish.\\" (p. 203); \\"Goikeda's Dante and my Dante really share the same soul.\\" (p. 205). Hideki Kamiya, Devil May Cry Volume 1 pg 203, TokyoPop, 2006  Plot  The novel begins with Dante, under the alias Tony Redgrave, confronted by the thug \\"Mad Dog\\" Denvers for the ninety-ninth time.Shinya Goikeda, Devil May Cry Volume 1, TokyoPop, 2006 Dante kills all of Denvers' men and leaves. As Denvers reminisces about how Dante's appearance two years previously caused the fall of the local underworld, he is killed by scythe- wielding devils screaming Dante's name. In Bobby's Cellar, a mercenary hideout, Dante talks with his partner Grue. He then leaves Bobby's Cellar, heading to Goldstein's Shop, run by gunsmith Nell Goldstein. Bantering with Nell, Dante mentions he wrecks guns quickly due to the rate of fire he employs. Returning to Bobby's Cellar, Dante acquires a lucrative job with Grue. During the job it becomes clear to Dante and Grue that it is too dangerous, so they retreat. Later, as both men evaluate the aftermath of the pitched battle, they are attacked by the corpses. Dante destroys them, though Grue freezes. Afterwards, Grue and Dante eat dinner with Grue's family. At Bobby's Cellar Enzo introduces a new mercenary named Gilver, a tall man swathed in bandages who wields a katana. Gilver fights Dante, proving himself equal. Deciding to settle the fight with drinking, Dante wins and Gilver is robbed by the bar patrons. After leaving, Dante is beset by demons and an undead Denvers. Dante awakens in the home of a local woman, who he spurns before leaving. He learns that killing Denvers has led to a bounty being placed on his head by the Oz Club. He leaves to confront the club directly.Entering a bank, he fights the same demons once again. Defeating them he runs into Gilver, who has slaughtered the Oz Club. Weeks later, Dante and Gilver are now being paired on numerous jobs and Grue is missing. On the way to work, Dante stops by Nell's home, giving him two handguns and warning him about Gilver. Dante runs into Grue, who has been taking assassination jobs. After leaving Dante, Grue kills a heavily in debt thug. This sparks a demonic transformation among the thug's friends and Grue's hiding place is revealed by Gilver. Grue ignites a grenade on his chest, trying to kill Gilver. Dante and Gilver continue as partners, and Enzo reveals that Grue did assassinations because of his daughter Jessica's illness. Dante goes to the hospital and finds it overrun by demons. Dante faces the demon in charge, who is feeding on Jessica's despair. He kills the demon and Jessica, shattering the connection between the human world and demon realm. Due to the hospital massacre and Grue's disappearance, Dante is publicly scorned by other mercenaries. Gilver converts the patrons of Bobby's Cellar into demons while Dante goes to Nell Goldstein's for rest. Soon after he leaves, an explosion engulfs Goldstein's Shop in flames. Dante charges in, finding Nell working on two handguns made especially for him: Ebony and Ivory. Giving him the handguns, Nell then dies. Dante ceases using the Tony Redgrave alias. Dante returns to Bobby's Cellar and confronts Gilver. Amidst a furious sword fight, Gilver shoots Dante with the shotgun purchased at Nell's shop. Fatally shooting Gilver in turn, Dante is horrified to discover that Gilver is his brother Vergil. Much later, Enzo drops by Bobby's Cellar and helps Dante leave. In the novel's epilogue, Dante sits in his shop as Devil May Cry begins. Devil May Cry Volume 2 Devil May Cry Volume 2 covers the period after the first Devil May Cry video game until the events of Devil May Cry 2. This release features a different art style than Devil May Cry Volume 1, with the artist utilizing shading and ink washes in addition to black and white. The translators of the novel deliberately chose not to translate the Beastheads' name into Cerberus due to the appearance of the Cerberus in Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening, despite the obvious resemblance. Likewise, they maintained Vergil's alias as Nelo Angelo despite feeling that Nero Angelo (lit. Black Angel) was more correct.Paul Cheng & Gemma Collinge, Devil May Cry Volume 2 pg 205, TokyoPop, 2006  Plot  The novel begins as a redheaded woman, Beryl, storms through a temple. As a priest tells her that no evil is within the temple, they are attacked. Warned by a scar, Beryl expends her anti-tank gun on her foe before it flees.Shinya Goikeda, Devil May Cry Volume 2, TokyoPop, 2006 Dante and Enzo talk about work in Dante's shop, Devil May Cry. As they discuss Dante's work habits and Trish's non-presence, Dante gets a call for work. As Enzo drops Dante off near the temple, Dante races towards the evil he feels and discovers humanoid demons, who he fights. Enzo finds Beryl on the road and agrees to take her back up the mountain. Beryl catches up with Dante as he finishes his foes, and she nearly hits him with her weapon by accident. Beryl then explains the Beastheads, a demonic statue which she has chased for years. A youth named Ducas is awakened by a demon crashing through his roof. In the demon's hands is the Beastheads statue, which Ducas takes. Chen, the boss of organized crime in the area, quickly arrives. Chen dismisses Ducas and instead focuses on the dead demon and discovers that Ducas has the statue. Meanwhile, Dante broods about the Beastheads. Beryl locates Dante's office, having tracked down the Beastheads to Ducas. Beryl persuades Dante to help her investigate. Ducas' good luck continues and he is learning to control the Beastheads, allowing him to see the future and sees Dante killing him. Moments later, Dante and Beryl crash through the window as Ducas hides. After they leave, Ducas escapes by sprouting feathered wings, which Beryl and Dante notice. Ducas lands on a building, encountering Chen. Chen offers Ducas safety, sending his demonic minions to stop Dante. Dante dispatches the foes with ease, though Beryl finds herself overwhelmed. As Dante and Beryl decide to confront Chen, Ducas finds himself alone on a yacht. He places the Beastheads in his mouth and chews it to pieces to consume its power. The Beastheads, now an enormous three-headed dog, tracks Dante and Beryl to a sea-side cliff. The despair the Beastheads causes nearly incapacitates Beryl. Seeing Dante fight reminds Beryl of the Dark Knight, Sparda, a fairy tale she was told as a child. She gets up and aids Dante, though defeating the Beastheads causes them to warp somewhere. Beryl dreams, remembering how the Beastheads corrupted her father. She awakens in a cave with Dante. Dante investigates and discovers they are in a parallel world where Mundus captured him as a child and his brother Vergil led Mundus' lieutenants against him. Dante agrees to fight Mundus a second time. The village housing the rebel demons is attacked by an army, all of whom resemble Trish. Mundus' former lieutenants give their lives to aid Dante in killing Trish, an action he regrets. Griffon leads Dante to Mundus' castle. Dante and Beryl enter and Dante defeats Mundus a second time while Beryl watches. Beryl and Dante awaken in Chen's labs, where Chen performs experiments on demons. The building vibrates as Chen acquires the Beastheads' power. They attack Chen, killing his minions and causing him to flee. Dante and Beryl follow and are caught in Chen's trap. Chen discovers that the Beastheads consumes human souls but replenishes demonic power. Dante carves his way out of the trap while Chen devours the Beastheads statue. Chen and Dante clash, both using the Sparda's sword-style. Chen gains the upper hand until Dante hurls his sword through Chen's head. Beryl uses her gun to punch through Chen's defense, allowing Dante to destroy the Beastheads. The book ends months later with a white-hilted dagger flying through Dante's front window, bearing an invitation to the museum seen in the beginning of Devil May Cry 2. Devil May Cry 4: Deadly Fortune Devil May Cry 4: Deadly Fortune is a two-volume adaptation of the fourth video game in the series, Devil May Cry 4. It was written by the game's writer, Bingo Morihashi, with assistance from Yasui Kentarou. The two novels were published by Capcom during 2009. In the afterword, Bingo wrote that these removed scenes were intended to be included in the game, but were not due to some production reasons. The novel adapts the story of Devil May Cry 4 that focuses on a young holy knight named Nero who works for the Order of the Sword. Nero is given the job of capturing Dante after he seemingly kills Sanctus, the leader of the Order of the Sword. The novel expands the story from Devil May Cry 4 such as Nero's background. It is revealed he was found as, a baby, alone in Fortuna and was adopted by the parents of Credo and Kyrie. Having decided to follow Credo's footsteps, Nero joined the Order of the Sword but he was not accepted due to his use of guns, something which the hunters did not allow. During Nero's quest he meets an unknown man in a dream when he receives the sword Yamato. Dante also takes an interest in Nero's origins after finding that he is very similar to his twin brother, Vergil. As in the game, Nero discovers that Sanctus and his soldiers have become demons and plan to use the power from Dante's father, Sparda, to open the gates from the Demon World and gain people's faith by saving them from the demons. After Nero and Dante ally to defeat Sanctus, the former starts his own demon hunting business in Fortuna after the Order of the Sword is disbanded. Devil May Cry 5 Before the Nightmare Devil May Cry 5 -Before the Nightmare- (ËßíÂ∑ù„Çπ„Éã„Éº„Ç´„ÉºÊñáÂ∫´) is a prequel novel that takes places before Devil May Cry 5 and leads up to beginning of the game. It was written by the game's writer, Bingo Morihashi. The novel was released on March 1, 2019 in Japan, days before Devil May Cry 5 is release. Taking place five years after Devil May Cry 4, Nero and Kyrie are living together in the ruins of Fortuna when the former is approached by weapon artist Nico Goldstien. While initially wary of her rude demeanor and her heritage as both the daughter of the Order of the Sword's scientist Angus, and the granddaughter of the gunsmith whose firearms Dante possesses, Nero gradually warms up to her. As the trust between them grew, Nico offers her services to refurbish Nero's van so he can make money as a traveling demon hunter. Not long after however, Nero encounters a dying demon who rips off his Devil Bringer arm with Nero losing consciousness. Meanwhile, Dante returns to Vie de Marli after ten years and helps Lucia defend the island against a fire- imbued demon named Balrog, who utilized a fragment of Vergil's sword Yamato to enter the human world. After Dante manages to defeat Balrog using the ice- imbued Cerberus Devil Arm, the demon recognizes him as Sparda's son and the one who defeated his master Argosax. He then offers himself as a new Devil Arm to replace the shattered Cerberus, until he can become strong enough to challenge Dante to a rematch. A few days later while visiting Grue's surviving daughters Tiki and Nesty, J.D. Morrison encounters a man known as \\"V\\" who requests him to take him to the Devil May Cry office so he may hire Dante, Lady, and Trish in suppressing a certain demon who gives the demon hunter a reason to fight. While Dante learns the identity of the demon, Lady is visited by Morrison as a television broadcast regarding the appearance of the demonic Qliphoth tree in Red Grave City airs, leading Lady to realize Dante is somehow connected to the city. Dante's group soon arrive at the Qliphoth tree in response to their quarry Urizen awakening ahead of schedule, with V enlisting Nero who leaves Fortuna in secret to not concern Kyrie and Nico. Shortly after as Dante's group begin their mission, Trish reflects on how Mundus kept tabs on Dante and Vergil since Eva's death. Knowing of their survival, Mundus then created both her and the Angelos to succeed in killing them where the demons in his employ failed. Thanks to her knowledge of various demons, Trish attempts to figure out who Urizen is before she and Lady are knocked out by the Demon King before Dante arrives. Dante engages in a friendly banter with Urizen before assuming Devil Trigger mode to fight him, as V and Nero arrive. But Urizen proves too much for the group as Dante holds him off so V can get Nero to safety, V telling Nero they have a month to prevent the end of the world. V chooses to remain in Red Grave City to collect intel and save as many as he can from the Qliphoth's blood-sucking roots, expressing some guilt of his former self. Nero meanwhile returns to Fortuna where he learns Nico is building his Devil Breaker prosthetic while insisting to accompany him for maintenance and to meet Dante.

Geography Lakeside in D√∂briach The town is situated in the Gegend valley (Gegendtal) of the Nock Mountains range (part of the Gurktal Alps), stretching to the eastern shore of Lake Millstatt. Radenthein borders on the municipalities of Millstatt in the west and Bad Kleinkirchheim in the east. The municipal area comprises the cadastral communities of D√∂briach, Kaning, Laufenberg, Radenthein proper, Sankt Peter, and Tweng. History The remote, densely forested valley was not colonized until about 1000. A chapel at villam Ratehtim was first mentioned in an 1177 deed, then part of the Millstatt Abbey estates within the Duchy of Carinthia; it was raised to a parish in 1262. Since the Middle Ages Radenthein had been an iron ore and garnet mining area and the site of a finery forge, even the use of reverberatory furnaces is documented since the late 18th century. When about 1908 an extensive occurrence of magnesite was discovered and the foundation of the \\"Austro-American Magnesite\\" mining company led to a large increase in population. The municipality obtained the status of a town in 1995. The mining company (now RHI AG at Vienna producing refractory materials) is still the main employer. Besides which, there is considerable hotel and tourist trade in D√∂briach on the lakeside of the Millst√§tter See. A museum (Granatium) documents the local history of garnet mining.

It acts as an umbrella organization for 14 national bobsleigh and skeleton associations . It was founded on 23 November 1923 by the delegates of Great Britain, France, Switzerland, Canada and the United States at the meeting of their first International Congress in Paris, France. In June 2015, it announced a name change from FIBT to IBSF. The federation's headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland. History of bobsleigh The world's first bobsleigh club was founded in St. Moritz, Switzerland in 1897. By 1904, competitions were taking place on natural ice courses (Olympia Bobrun St. Moritz-Celerina). This growth led to the creation of the FIBT in 1923 with inclusion into the International Olympic Committee (IOC) the following year. At the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, the four-man event took place. In 1930, the first FIBT World Championships took place with the four-man event in Caux-sur-Montreux, Switzerland with the first two-man event taking place in Oberhof, Germany the following year. At the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, the two- man competition debuted. In 1935, the Internationaler Schlittensportsverband (ISSV ‚Äì International Sled Sport Federation in ), a forerunner to the Federation Internationale de Luge de Course (FIL ‚Äì International Luge Federation in ), was absorbed into the FIBT and a Section de Luge was created. The luge section would be abolished when the FIL was split off in 1957. Because of the growing weight issue at the 1952 Winter Olympics, the first changes occurred when weight limits were introduced. Since then, configurations to the tracks and the bobsleigh itself would be regulated for both competition and safety reasons. Also, bobsleigh was not included in the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California for cost reasons in track construction. The development of artificially refrigerated tracks in the late 1960s and early 1970s would greatly enhance speeds. World Cup competitions were first developed in the 1980s while women's competitions took place in the early 1990s. The 2-woman bobsleigh event had their first World Championships in Winterberg, Germany in 2000 and debuted at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. History of skeleton Skeleton was also founded in Switzerland in 1884 as part of the Cresta Run. It remained a Swiss competition until 1906 when the first competitions outside Switzerland took place in Austria. At the 1926 FIBT World Congress in Paris, it was approved that skeleton was an official Winter Olympic sport with competition taking place at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz. 13 competitors from five nations took part. Twenty years later, skeleton reappeared on the Olympic program when the 1948 Winter Olympics returned to St. Moritz. At the 1954 IOC meeting in Athens, Greece, skeleton was replaced by luge on the official Olympic program. This caused skeleton to fall into obscurity until the development of a \\"bobsleigh skeleton\\" which could be used on any bobsleigh track in 1970. The development of artificial tracks would also help the rebirth of skeleton as a sport. The first European Championship was held in 1982 at K√∂nigsee, Germany, and the first World Championships were also staged in 1982 at St. Moritz. By 1986, the FIBT started funding skeleton and introduced training schools worldwide to grow the sport. The following year, skeleton European Championships were introduced annually. In 1989, skeleton World Championships were introduced, although the women's championships were not formed until 2000 at Igls, Austria. Skeleton was reintroduced in the Winter Olympic program when the IOC allowed competition for the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City, US.

Early years Crowley was the son of Ambrose Crowley II, a Quaker blacksmith in Stourbridge, and Mary Hall and rose Dick Whittington-style to become Sheriff of London for 1706. He was knighted according to custom the following year. Career The Crowley Iron Works at Winlaton, Winlaton Mill, and at Swalwell, all in County Durham were probably, at the time, Europe's biggest industrial location and later, as he was owed so much money by the British Government, Ambrose became a director of the South Sea Company on its formation. Today, he is still known for his enlightened management methods. His workers had an elected works committee, sickness payments, company medical team and were treated with respect. These rules are set out in the 'Rules of the Crowley Iron'. The main works at Winlaton Mill mainly used imported iron and both iron and steel were worked by the Heyford process. Technologies and skills developed at Winlaton Mill were to lead to the foundation of the Sheffield steel industry and to the ability to machine steel. British iron production was carried out at Ynyscedwyn in South Wales and in the Wealden area of Southern England. The business survived into the Victorian era and the 'Crowley Crew' were renowned for their skills with metal and their steadfast and resolute defence of their rights and freedoms in the face of government intimidation. In August 1713 he was elected Member of Parliament for Andover but died on 17 October. Family Ambrose married Mary Owen, daughter of Charles Owen. They had many children die young. His wife's memorial lists seven children who died as infants. The children that lived to adulthood were as follows: *John Crowley who married Theodosia Gascoigne *Mary who married Sir James Hallett *Lettice married Sir John Hynde Cotton, 3rd Baronet *Sarah married Humphry Parsons *Anna married Richard Fleming *Elizabeth married Lord St John of Bletsoe. British comedian and actor Alexander Armstrong is a direct descendant. Burial Sir Ambrose was buried at SS Peter and Paul's Church at Mitcham in Surrey where there is a monument with the following inscription: > NEAR THIS PLACE ARE DEPOSITED THE REMAINS OF SIR AMBROSE CROWLEY KNIGHT, > CITIZEN AND ALDERMAN OF LONDON, WHOSE NUMEROUS FAMILY AND GREAT ESTATE WERE > THE PRESENT REWARDS OF AN IDEFATIGABLE INDUSTRY AND APPLICATION TO BUSINESS, > AN UNBLEMISHED PROBITY, AND A SINCERE BELIEF AND PRACTICE OF TRUE > CHRISTIANITY, AND PARTICULARLY A BOUNDLESS LIBERALITY TOWARDS THE POOR, MANY > HUNDREDS OF WHOM HE CONTINUALLY EMPLOYED.

Geography M√∂ll valley, view from Danielsberg Situated within the valley of the M√∂ll river, a tributary to the Drava, Rei√üeck is located about northwest of the district capital Spittal an der Drau. The present-day municipality established in 1973 consists of the four cadastral communities Kolbnitz, Zandlach, Penk, and Teuchl. It was named after the Rei√üeck massif (2,965m/9,727 ft) in the north, part of the Ankogel Group of the Hohe Tauern mountain range. South of the M√∂ll Valley rises the Kreuzeck Group. Equidistant between the ski resorts of Ankogel/M√∂lltal Glacier and Lake Millstatt, facilities in Kolbnitz include a rafting centre, a riding centre, tennis courts, a small ski area and a swimming pool. Two funicular railway lines leave from the M√∂ll valley bottom: the first runs up the Rei√üeck mountain to an altitude of 2236m/7336 ft to walking trails and a hotel; the second leads to the mountain rail station of Mt. Kreuzeck at 1211m/3973 ft, which is the starting point for several alpine walks up to 2498m/8195 ft. The operation of the Rei√üeck H√∂henbahn on the Rei√üeck plateau, one of the highest-lying narrow- gauge railroads in Europe, was closed down in 2014. Rei√üeck funicular Rei√üeck has access to the Tauern Railway line, running from Spittal an der Drau through the Tauern Railway Tunnel to Schwarzach im Pongau, at the Kolbnitz and Penk stations. It also can be reached via the parallel M√∂lltal Stra√üe (B106) highway from Lurnfeld in the Drava valley up to Obervellach and Winklern. Kolbnitz The Hohe Tauern mountains are a traditional mining area, mainly for gold, silver and iron. Originally held by the Bishops of Freising, the main village Kolbnitz was first mentioned as Cholomunze in an 1124 deed. Shortly afterwards, the estates passed to the Counts of Gorizia (Meinhardiner dynasty) residing at Falkenstein Castle. About 1460 they were finally seized by the Austrian House of Habsburg ruling in the Duchy of Carinthia. In the course of a 1973 administrative reform, Kolbnitz an der Tauernbahn was merged with neighbouring Penk and M√ºhldorf into the municipality of Rei√üeck. In 1992 M√ºhldorf again separated to become a commune in its own right. Danielsberg Danielsberg A cup marked stone found on the cone shaped 966 m (3170 ft) Danielsberg mountain northwest of Kolbnitz denote a settlement since the days of the Stone Age. Further archaeological artifacts near the water well at the summit of the prominent peak indicate the existence of a Celtic sacred grove and a Roman temple dedicated to Hercules. An Early Christian chapel consecrated to prophet Daniel was probably erected at the site about 313. After Bishop Modestus had Christianized the area again in the 8th century, a new St George church was built at the summit in 1127. It was first mentioned as monte sancti Danielis in 1292 report of an unsuccessful campaign by late Count Meinhard I of Gorizia and his father-in-law Count Albert IV of Tyrol against the Carinthian duke Bernhard von Spanheim. The church was enlarged in 1515 and a steeple attached in 1750. Beneath the church is the Herkuleshof, now a hotel, erected in 1908. Hydropower Rei√üeck has two hydroelectric power plants (Kraftwerk Kolbnitz and Kraftwerk Rottau) run by the Verbund power company. The water is collected in several reservoirs in the Rei√üeck (linked with the K√∂lnbrein Dam in the upper Malta valley) and Kreuzeck mountains and lead to the plant through five penstocks with a maximum altitude difference of about 1772m/5815 ft. Seven (Kraftwerk Kolbnitz) resp. four (Kraftwerk Rottau) Pelton wheels, generating a maximum electric power of 138 to 220 Megawatt each, provide an overall annual electricity production of 1013 mio Kilowatt hours.

Before its merger it became an Arts College. The school opened in September 1992 as a replacement for Silver Royd Girls school. It was turned into a high school for both, In June 2009 the school announced it would be closing following a merger with West Leeds High School. The students had their last day on 17 July 2009. In September 2009 Students returned with both sites being Swallow Hill Community College. The site only lasted as Swallow Hill Community College for 2 years between 2009 and 2011. All students moved to the newest built Congress Mount site on 4 July 2011. Pupils A higher than average proportion of pupils were eligible for free school meals. The school accepted a number of pupils who were challenging or difficult to place in schools elsewhere in the district. Relatively few pupils were from minority ethnic groups but there was a recent increase in the number of pupils from refugee families. The number of pupils with English as an additional language was well below average. The number of pupils with learning difficulties and/or disabilities was higher than average, including the proportion of pupils who had statements of special educational need. Wortley was one of two schools in Leeds to provide a resource for pupils with complex speech and language difficulties. Organisation The school was part of a federation with a neighbouring school, with which it amalgamated in 2009 as part of the Building Schools for the Future plans in the district. Sixth form partnerships existed with neighbouring schools and were being developed to increase the range of provision for pupils aged 16 to 19. Replacement In 2006 West Leeds High School was told that it would be merging with Wortley High School to form one new school. This was said to be due to the falling birth rate in the local area. Both schools opposed the merger saying merging would create more faults than benefits. The new school is being built on the Congress Mount site. The Wortley High site will be used as an annex for the lower years until the school's admissions are reduced. In 2009 the school closed and merged with local high school West Leeds High School to form the new Swallow Hill Community College.

Early life Alfred Ferrara Jr. was born on December 22, 1939, in Brooklyn, New York to Al Ferrara Sr. and his wife Adele. Al Sr. was a New York City fireman for 20 years who later was an air conditioning technician for Chase Bank before working the gate at Jackie Gleason‚Äôs Inverrary Country Club in Florida in his retirement. Adele Ferrara, a homemaker, died when Al Jr. was 17, leaving her mother, Assunta Paulucci, in charge of Al and his twin siblings Frank and Theodora, who were 12 at the time. As a youth he was also an accomplished piano player. ‚ÄúI never wanted to play the piano, I wanted to play baseball,‚Äù Ferrara said. ‚ÄúBut a first- generation Italian woman like my grandmother didn‚Äôt know anything about baseball, so I had to play the piano, starting at age eight. I learned the classics. Mr. Morvillo insisted that I read music and play the pieces as they were written by Beethoven and Bach. I got pretty good and I learned to use piano to do what I wanted to do. I had a deal with my grandmother that after playing for an hour she would give me a quarter to go to the Bat Away at Coney Island. In those days you could hit about 25 balls for a quarter. After a while I got a reputation as a pretty good hitter and men would come around when I was hitting and put more quarters in the machine so I could hit for maybe a half-hour. Finally, I got my grandmother to agree that if I were to become Mr. Morvillo‚Äôs number one student I could give up piano and play baseball. He would have showcase recitals at Carnegie Hall, and the number one student would play last. When I was 16, I went on last as the number one student, kissed my grandmother, and never touched the piano again.‚Äù Ferrara attended Lafayette High School (New York City) where he was a high school classmate of Bob Aspromonte and played sandlot baseball with Joe Torre and Joe Pepitone. The summer of 1957 was a turning point for Ferrara. He did well enough for the amateur traveling team Dodger Rookies that Dodgers' scout Buck Lai, who was also the athletic director at Long Island University, arranged for Ferrara to get a baseball scholarship to LIU. After a successful season there, he signed a $9,000 bonus contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1958. Major league career He made his major league debut at age 23 on July 23, 1963, in a 5-1 Dodgers' loss to the New York Mets at Dodger Stadium. His first hit was in his third game, off Dick Ellsworth. His first homer the next day, off Bob Buhl, was one of three hit by the Dodgers in the fifth inning of a 5-4 loss to the Cubs. He did not play in the 1963 World Series. He came up again in 1965 for 41 games but again saw no action in the 1965 World Series. In 1966, he had one of his best seasons. He played in 63 games with 129 plate appearances, hitting .270, and playing in the 1966 World Series, in which he had one hit in one at bat. In 1967 he had his most productive season to-date. In 384 plate appearances, he hit 16 home runs (a career high) with 50 runs batted in and a .277 average.https://www.baseball- reference.com/players/f/ferraal01.shtml He was voted Dodger of the Year. ‚ÄúI was young, fun and wacky, and I had L.A. in my hands,‚Äù he said. Ferrara appeared on episodes of Gilligan‚Äôs Island and Batman through connections with fans in show business and through former teammate Lee Walls, who had become a talent agent. ‚ÄúThat all came from being a player. I wasn‚Äôt willing to put in the effort to pursue a real acting career.‚Äù He played in only two games in 1968. In the Dodgers' second game of the season, he was chasing down a line drive to the outfield by the Mets' Tommie Agee when he caught a spike in a sprinkler and broke his ankle, ending his season and his Dodgers' career. He was picked by the San Diego Padres in the 1969 expansion draft, becoming one of the original Padres in 1969. In 1969, he hit .260 with 14 home runs and 56 RBIs, and followed that up with another good season in 1970, hitting .277 with 13 home runs and 51 RBIs. In 1971, after playing 17 games with the Padres, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds, appearing in 32 games almost exclusively as a pinch-hitter. His final major league game was on September 1, 1971. After baseball In 1974 Ferrara appeared as a contestant on Match Game '74, listing his profession as a \\"freelance piano buyer.\\" Ferrara played to a zero-zero tie against defending champion Marlena Cruz; Cruz won the game 1‚Äì0 in a tiebreaker match. After leaving baseball, he spent four years as a greeter at the Martoni Marquis on Sunset Strip in Los Angeles before going into sales for various home-improvement companies, eventually starting his own company, Major League Construction. That work lasted 30 years; Ferrara sold his business and retired in 2005 at age 65. Then, the recession of 2008 occurred and Ferrara lost about a quarter of his retirement savings. ‚ÄúGoing back into sales or getting a job would have been rough at my age, so I decided to go back home . . . and called the Dodgers.‚Äù The Dodgers put Ferrara to work in their community relations department in July 2009. He visits elementary schools and reads Dr. Seuss books to the kids; he cautions teens about the evils of alcohol, tobacco and drugs; and he entertains guests at some Dodger home games. He lives with his companion of over 35 years, Kay Donno. Ferrara was previously married twice, once at age 20 and again at age 30. He has a son, Al Ferrara III of West Islip, New York, a daughter-in-law Maureen, and two grandchildren, Alfred IV and Samantha.

Life  Karl Holzamer was born in Frankfurt am Main and after the abitur in 1926 studied philosophy, pedagogy, psychology, and German at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, the Sorbonne, the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main and the University of Bonn. In 1929, he was awarded his Ph.D. from Munich. After university he applied to the Pedagogic Academy in Bonn and did his First Examination as a Volksschullehrer. His reason for becoming a teacher was, according to him: \\"If you want to educate as a Volksschule teacher, then you have to go to Volksschule yourself.\\" In 1931, Holzamer was co-publisher of the magazine \\"Stimmen der Jugend\\" (\\"Voices of Youth\\") in D√ºsseldorf. Within a short time, he became an assistant at the Psychological Institute of the University of Bonn and in November 1931 became assistant in the psychological department of the Westdeutscher Rundfunk. In politics he got involved in the \\"Reichsjugendausschuss\\" (Council of the Youth in the Reich) of the Zentrumspartei. Parallel to his occupations, an application to become a professor was started.  Third Reich  After the Machtergreifung, Holzamer had to end his political engagement. At his broadcaster, his boss and the director general were laid-off, so he had to lead the educational department on his own, then the agricultural department (without proper experience) because of no party membership to the NSDAP, the language department and confessional morning celebrations (CMC). The last post (CMC) existed still in 1937 at the previously-renamed \\"Reichsender K√∂ln\\" despite an order not to have such a department. At the beginning of World War II, Holzamer was drafted into the army. He came as an air-gunner into the Luftwaffe (Air Force) and became war reporter for audio news. At the end of WW II, he was a prisoner-of-war of the French, where he worked as a translator.  Educational life  Karl Holzamer handed in his application as professor at the Prussian Cultural Ministry ( under the direction of Adolf Grimme. The professorship expired in 1937, but despite there being vacancies, he wasn't allocated to the university service. After World War II, with his good certificates from various high- level universities, the American occupation force facilitated him in 1946 to a professorship in philosophy, psychology and pedagogy at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz. In 1952 he was appointed professor ordinarius. In 1948, he got professorship for scholastic philosophy and pedagogy. As a representative of the University of Mainz, he got into the television council of the S√ºdwestfunk Baden-Baden (precursor of the S√ºdwestrundfunk). Because Holzamer was the only one of 49 people with practical experience, he was from 1949 to 1960 the Chairman. ZDF Karl Holzamer was recommended by then- Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in 1960 as director general of the proposed private television \\"Freies Fernsehen Gesellschaft\\" (FFG). The board of directors rejected the recommendation. As a CDU candidate - where he had the overwhelming approval of the rival SPD -he was elected director general by the television council of the ZDF, the successor of the FFG. He was re-elected twice. In 1977, he retired. His successor in the post was Karl-G√ºnther von Hase. Wim Thoelke, a prominent former television host, said of the time of Holzamer at the ZDF: \\"Karl Holzamer was a man of vitalizing optimism, as well as highly intelligent and critical in a positive kind of manner. Without him, it would impossible for the ZDF to be successful.\\" Holzamer co-created the Aktion Sorgenkind, a German humanitarian organization (renamed to Aktion Mensch), by extending its cause well beyond the television show Vergi√ümeinnicht (Forget-me-not). Holzamer was an honorary member of club KStV Kurpfalz Mainz im KV.  Private life  Karl Holzamer married in 1932 his fiance Helene, with whom he had four children. Helene died in 1992.

Plot Kam Kong plays an evil Manchurian General, who desires to crush the revolutionaries who have ties to the Shaolin temple. Chen Kuan Tai is Iron, a naive young man who is unaware that his father is a leader of this underground movement. An undercover operative named Ho Yeng, who conned his way into joining the rebellion, betrays Iron's father. The entire family is captured (except for Iron) and the General schedules their executions the following day. Since the leader of the rebellion is now in his clutches, the General focuses on the capture of his enemy's son, Iron. A witness to this heinous act warns Iron and he manages to escape the village and avoid capture from the Qing army. He becomes a wild, animalistic wanderer who survives by stealing food from a nearby Shaolin temple. He also watches the hopefuls who train in the martial arts there. A group of students eventually catch him breaking into the temple, and they comment on his monkey-like agility. One student (Chi Kuan Chun) follows him into the woods and suggests that Iron become a student of the Shaolin Temple. The Abbot is more than happy to accept him as a pupil, but he notices the look of anger in the young man's eyes. Iron refuses to comment on his agenda or his identity, so the Abbott assigns him a new identity‚Äîthat of Iron Monkey. Iron Monkey soon proves himself a natural in the temple training arena. In a short time, he becomes a top student, at the expense of his peers‚Äô friendship (as they are naturally jealous). Soon, the head monks inform the students that they must select a specialized martial arts technique. Naturally, Iron Monkey selects the fearsome Monkey Fist method, which is unrivaled in the martial arts world, except for Eagle's Claw style. The Abbot sends Iron Monkey out into the wilderness where he is trained by the exiled Bitter Monk. In a year's time, Iron Monkey masters the Monkey Fist and returns to the temple with confidence and ability. The Abbott welcomes him back, but senses that Iron Monkey is still motivated by hatred and rage. The Abbot tells him that he must alleviate his inner pain, and return to the temple a wiser man cleansed of hatred. The timing is perfect as the General's guard intrude upon the Shaolin temple to recruit martial artists to the Qing cause. But the students and monks are loyal to their beliefs, and no one sells out‚Äîexcept for Iron Monkey. Like the hated betrayer of his father, Ho Yeng, Iron Monkey plans to join the Manchus and destroy their organization from within. His ultimate goal is to get close to the General, so he can assassinate the man responsible for the death of his family. But first he must prove himself. The General doesn't trust Iron Monkey and assigns him the task of hunting and killing suspected revolutionaries. Iron Monkey immerses himself in Manchu propaganda and begins beating and killing his own people! But, the Captains and the General take notice of his skills and behavior, and he is given a promotion. The Manchus still don't trust him and orders him to kill more radicals. The more people Iron Monkey kills, the higher he rises in the Qing hierarchy. Eventually he becomes equal in rank to the Captains that recruited him. But he has still not achieved his goal of meeting the General. When the Manchus order Iron Monkey to crush the Shaolin Temple itself, he realizes he must finally make his move. He confronts the entire chain of the Manchu hierarchy, starting with the traitor Ho Yeng, to the Captains, and finally the General himself. However, the General did not earn his position for nothing. He is a master of the Eagle's Claw‚Äîthe only form of martial arts that can overcome the Monkey Fist.

The picture shows significant amount of dirt and the colors have shifted severely. Also the aspect ratio is not correct and the image appears more or less stretched. This is common among all three DVDs, which suggests that they were taken from the same source. This is important as the UK DVD features a deleted scene which is in a much better condition. It has nearly no dirt, no color shift and it features the original dialogue with English subtitles.

He served as Town Clerk of Glasgow for thirty-one years, during which time the entire city was transformed. Its powers and amenities were improved by by-laws and Acts of Parliament, and Marwick directed the city of Glasgow's development for much of the second half of the 19th century. Biography The grave of James David Marwick, Warriston Cemetery A son of William Marwick, a merchant from Kirkwall, Orkney, and his wife, Margaret Garioch, James was born at 95 Kirkgate in central Leith, where his father then worked as a baker.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1826-7 James was educated in Kirkwall Grammar School and then studied Law at the University of Edinburgh. He was then apprenticed to James B Watt solicitor at 9 York Place in Edinburgh.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1842 He was admitted a procurator at Dundee in 1852, and became a solicitor before the Supreme Courts six years later. In 1855 he founded the Edinburgh legal firm of Watt & Marwick. As the address of this firm is also 9 York Place it is presumed he merged with the same James Watt under whom he was apprenticed.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1855 For some time he was a member of the Town Council of Edinburgh, and he became Town Clerk of that city in 1860. He was also clerk to the Convention of Royal Burghs from 1861 to 1876. In 1873 Marwick was offered a salary of ¬£2,500 per annum (three times his previous salary) to succeed Angus Turner as Glasgow's Town Clerk. He used his influence to promote the expansion of the city's boundaries. The City Chambers was erected between 1882 and 1888 as a symbol of municipal confidence and wealth. During those years he occupied a unique place in the municipal, literary, and social life of the city. He enjoyed the friendship of the successive Lord Provosts of Edinburgh and Glasgow. He gradually built up a reputation as the leading authority on municipal law in Scotland. His knowledge was utilised by successive Lord Advocates, and his opinion constantly sought by the Town Clerks of other burghs; and in no instance was that opinion overturned by the Courts. As a municipal organiser he had the task of framing and carrying out many of the greatest city enterprises of his time, including extension and improvements of the city, duplication of the water-works, the purification of the River Clyde, the Municipal Tramways, and municipal electricity. Marwick was also a prolific historian and writer. It was upon his initiative that the Scottish Burgh Record Society was founded, and he edited a number of the society's publications. He never lost interest in the island county from which he sprang, and many a young Orcadian, on coming south, was indebted to him for advice and help. Fellow Orcadian and town councillor William Walls was a particular friend. When in Edinburgh he took an active interest in the affairs of the Augustine Church, of which the Rev. William Lindsay Alexander was minister. In Glasgow he also took an active part in the management of Trinity Congregational Church. In 1861 he served as the first President of the Edinburgh Photographic Society.http://www.edinburghphotographicsociety.co.uk/wp/about/history/ Marwick was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1864 his proposer being Charles Piazzi Smyth. He received the degree of LL.D. from Glasgow University in 1878. The Freedom of the Burgh of Kirkwall was conferred on him later, and in 1888, on the occasion of her visit to the first Glasgow Exhibition, Queen Victoria gave him the honour of knighthood, this being the first occasion in which a municipal officer in Scotland was thus distinguished. When he left Edinburgh in 1873 the Corporation and citizens presented his wife with a full-length portrait of him painted by George Herdman, R.S.A., and on his retiral from the Town Clerkship of Glasgow in 1904 he was presented with an address and a valuable gift in testimony of the esteem in which he was held by the officials of the Corporation. Subsequently the citizens had his bust executed in duplicate by George Frampton, one of these being lodged in the art galleries, and the other presented to Sir James's family. He lived his final years at 19 Woodside Terrace in Glasgow,Glasgow Post Office Directory 1907-8 He died on 24 March 1908 and is buried in Warriston Cemetery in Edinburgh. The unusual monument lies to the north of the vaults. Family His wife, Lady Jane Marwick (1832-1919), whom he married in 1855, was a daughter of James Black Watt, a solicitor in Edinburgh, with whom he had a son James Marwick, an accountant who founded one of the predecessor firms of KPMG. His daughter Jean Watt Warwick married the architect John James Burnet. He appears to be uncle to the Edinburgh architect Thomas P. Marwick.

Geography  Katschberg pass road and Tauern Autobahn viaduct Rennweg is located in the Katsch Valley (Katschtal) between the Hohe Tauern range in the west and the Gurktal Alps (Nock Mountains) in the east, along the upper part of the Lieser River, a left tributary of the Drava. In the north runs the main chain of the Alps, with the Katschberg Pass mountain area considered one of the largest skiing resorts in Carinthia, bringing much of Rennweg's reputation. It is located on the Katschberg Stra√üe (B99) highway connecting Carinthia with the state of Salzburg, with access to the parallel Tauern Autobahn (A 10) and the Katschberg Tunnel. The municipal area consists of the cadastral communities Rennweg, St. Peter and Oberdorf. Nearby establishments Gm√ºnd, a town in the south of Rennweg, acts as a connecting point between the Lieser and Malta valleys. Spittal an der Drau, the district's centre, is located in the southeast of Gm√ºnd. The Millst√§tter See, a nearby lake acts as an attraction for tourists. By traveling further south on the Autobahn the city of Villach can be reached.  History  St. Peter, vicarage The settlement arose in the valley north of Rauchenkatsch Castle in the Duchy of Carinthia, first mentioned as castrum chaetze in an 1197 deed. The area, which initially was ceded to the Bishops of Freising by King Henry II of Germany in 1007, was then held by the Archbishops of Salzburg. Like the castle, the Katsch Valley is probably named after the Lords of Katsch in nearby Styria. It was administrated by Salzburg ministeriales in order to exercise control over the important trade route across Katschberg Pass. The present-day municipality was established in 1850 following the 1848 revolutions in the Austrian Empire. It was elevated to the status of market town in 2007.  Culture =Music The Katschtaler Trachtenkapelle, a group of Volksmusik instrumentalists, has played its share in the local concerts of the area. The music heard here is often found only in places like Rennweg, small villages that have not left behind the cultural music that has for centuries been a part of the Austrian culture. St George Church Religion The Saint George parish church can be found on the western side of the Katsch Valley. Saint Peter, another church on the eastern side of the valley has recently been renovated. It is located at the small village of St. Peter.  Katschberg  The Katschberg area is a popular ski resort at the border of Salzburg and Carinthia. It lies on a plateau directly above the Katschberg Tunnel, at an altitude of 1,641m. The upmarket ski resort consists mainly of four-star hotels and vacation apartments, most of which have access to the ski lifts. It retains a strong traditional atmosphere, as the local culture is regularly celebrated in folkloric evenings. Katschberg's 60 km of ski slopes span across two mountain tops. The resort's longest run is six kilometres, leading from the top of Aineck mountain to the village of Sankt Margarethen. The ski slopes are served by a system of 16 lifts with a capacity of 24,000 people per hour.

An English force led by George de Dunbar, 11th Earl of March and Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland attempted to take the forfeited Dunbar's Castle of Dunbar back from William Douglas, 2nd Earl of Angus, who as Warden of the Scottish Marches had invested the castle the previous summer. Percy and Dunbar came north with some 4,000 men. Angus did not want to undergo a siege, and decided to pre-empt the English by attacking them en route. An army of roughly the same force surprised the English, under Angus, Adam Hepburn of Hailes, Alexander Elphinstone of that ilk, and Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie.Ridpath pp400-1 Although an overwhelming Scots victory, there is some confusion as to casualties and prisoners taken. Ridpath states that the Scots lost 200 men including Elphinstone, with Brenan concurring about this 'trifling' amount,Brenan, Vol I, p99 whilst stating that the English fatalities were to the tune of 1,500 men, including 40 knights.Ridpath p401. Northumberland retreated to Alnwick Castle, but it was not long before he returned to Scotland to successfully relieve Roxburgh Castle, under siege by King James. Site of battle George Ridpath (Border History - 1776) states \\" The earl of Northumberland...advanced towards the Scottish marches but was met within his own territories at a place called Pepperden on Brammish not far from the mountain of Cheviot. The Breamish is the name given to the upper reaches of the River Till which arises in Cheviots \\"within the territory of the Earl of Northumberland\\". The site of the battle is probably in this area near Wooler rather than at Auld Cambus. There is no mention on the RCAHMS website of a battle site at Auld (or Old) Cambus, although the manuscripts of the Earl of Home state that it occurred near Dunglass.Home MS, p171 The Dept of Archaeology, Northumberland C.C. place the battle at Piperdean on the Pressen Burn near Wark (Grid Reference:NT8400635899).

The film stars Preity Zinta, Shiney Ahuja and Isha Koppikar in leading roles. Dharmendra appears in a supporting role as Zinta's father. The film relates the love story between two neighbours, played by Zinta and Ahuja, who are paired together on-screen for the first time.  Production  Preity Zinta and Shiney Ahuja were Jahnu Barua's first choices for the leading roles. Initially, Dipannita Sharma was supposed to play the supporting role of Zinta's roommate, but was later replaced by Isha Koppikar. Amitabh Bachchan was also supposed to make a role in the film as Zinta's father, but he later opted out due to date problems. Bachchan was subsequently replaced by Dharmendra, after Zinta, who was looking for an opportunity to work with him, had suggested his name. Dino Morea makes a special appearance in a song composed by Pritam Chakraborty. Filming began in August 2007 in Mumbai, and took place in Kolkata and Shillong, Meghalaya. The film's release was delayed for several years following rape charges which were brought on male lead Shiney Ahuja and which might have dampened the film's commercial prospects.

History The 15th century Church and Sanctuary of Nossa Senhora do Cabo lighthouse of Cabo Espichel A ruined hermitage on the cape Following the Calcholitic, human tribes began to look for elevated locations in order provide a natural defense; there are vestiges encountered in the area of Outeiro Redondo and Zambujal, that indicate this preoccupation and conflicts.M√°rio Nuno Antas and Sofia Ferreira (2011), p.9 During the Iron Age, there are documented references to the lands of Risco, farther to the west of Cabo Espichel, that was a largest undefended settlement at the time. Avieno in Orla Mar√≠tima named Cabo Espichel, Cabo C√™mpsico, and was probably because the name was associated with the peoples that lived in the vicinity. Later, the geographer Strabo called this area Promontorium Barbaricum. At a time when Roman settlement persisted in the Iberian peninsula, the Roman presence on the cape was limited. This can be explained by the symbology that the Romans conferred on the capes, which they considered sacred, where the gods met at night. Notwithstanding, there are vestiges of the Roman Imperial cult in the Lapa do Bugio, situated in Zambujal, close to Sesimbra. Until today there have not been encountered any evidence of Muslim settlement, but the local toponymy has a few markers, such as the name Az√≥ia, that derived from Al Zawiya (meaning hermitage). Some Moorish coins were also discovered in Lapa do Fumo (but minted in Silves) and some ceramics attributed to hermits from the Lapa do Forte do Cavalo and Lapa do Coelho. During the Middle Ages, various legends attracted people to the site; it was a crucible of Portuguese nationalism, when on 29 July 1180, in the square of Cabo Espichel, D. Fuas Roupinho was able to obtain the nation's first naval victory against the Moors. There are various legends associated with the cult of Nossa Senhora da Cabo, many contradictory, that situate the devotion during this time. It is possible that the cult resulted from Christianization of other cults that appeared in the pre-history and continued to Moorish occupation. The cult, though, is certainly medieval dating from the 13th century, with the first references appearing in the 14th century (specifically in 1366) from a royal letter sent by King D. Pedro I. Another medieval legend about the cape indicates that in 1215 a ship traveling to Lisbon was caught in a storm, tasking the crew. Haildebrat (the ships chaplain) decided to pray to an image, that he had in his cabin, but realized that it had disappeared. Desperate for divine intervention, they suddenly saw at the top of the cape a light, even during the height of the storm. Later, when they arrived on land, they encountered the disappeared image on the ship. Geography The cliff face of limestone and breccia Cabo Espichel is situated on the western coast of Portugal, along an extension of approximately that occupies a region called the Bacia Lusit√¢nica (BL), that occurred during the opening of the north Atlantic during Triassic.J. Oliveira et al. (2010), p.2 In tectonic terms, the BL is delimited by the Porto-Tomar fault and the Arrife-Vale fault in the eastern/lower Tagus and in the west by the Berlengas horst, corresponding to a ridge of intense tectonic subsistence along the north-northeast to south-southwest.Pena dos Reis et.al. (2008) The southern limit is located at an elevation south of Arr√°bida (at the Arr√°bida fault) and the southern limit corresponds to the watershed transition situated more to the north.Ribeiro et al. (1996) In addition to these faults, there are also faults with variable directions between east-west and northeast-southwest, that divide the basin into different tectonic-sedimentary areas, that could have influenced sediment deposition during Mesozoic. The BL is filled with sediments between the late Triassic and late Cretaceous, including alternating layers of marine carbonates, clastic carbonate coastal sediments, fluvial and estuarine siliciclastic deposits, among others. Also famous, are the several dinosaur fossil trackways exposed in some of the now tilted Jurassic strata which form the cape's cliffs. It is said that local superstition interpreted the trackways as the path taken by the Holy Virgin (\\"Nossa Senhora\\") when riding a giant mule from the ocean and up the cliffs, which led to the eventual construction of the convent at that location.http://dinosaurusblog.com/2017/02/28/giganticky-oslik-z-portugalska/ References=NotesSources * * Espichel Espichel Category:Fossil trackways Category:Geography of Set√∫bal District Category:Tourist attractions in Set√∫bal District ","title":"Cabo Espichel"},{"id":"10852491","text":":For the Nazi concentration camp, see Sachsenburg (concentration camp). Sachsenburg is a market town in the district of Spittal an der Drau in Carinthia, Austria. Geography Drava at Sachsenburg The municipal area stretches along the valley of the Drava river, where it enters the Lurnfeld plain between the Kreuzeck group of the Hohe Tauern mountain range in the north and Gailtal Alps in the south. The municipality comprises the cadastral communities of Sachsenburg and Obergottesfeld. History The origin of the name is uncertain: an affiliation with the far apart medi√¶val Duchy of Saxony has never been established; however the coat of arms probably awarded in the 16th century shows a Saxe, a kind of pan formerly used for gold prospecting within the nearby Hohe Tauern range. The strategically important narrow place of the Drava valley (Sachsenburger Klause) probably was guarded already in Roman times, when the area was part of the Noricum province. Markt Saxenburg, Johann Weikhard von Valvasor, 1681 Two fortresses blocking the passage along the river were first mentioned in a 1213 deed. Sachsenburg is documented as an administrative seat of the Archbishops of Salzburg in 1292, who held large possessions within the Duchy of Carinthia. As a Salzburg stronghold, it was a thorn in the flesh of both the Carinthian dukes and the Counts of Gorizia at Lienz, therefore often under attack by their forces. In 1252, Count Meinhard III of Gorizia allied with his father-in-law Count Albert IV of Tyrol laid siege to the fortress, though to no avail. The Salzburg archbishops granted the settlement market rights in 1326 and had further ramparts and town walls erected. Not until 1803 the Salzburg possessions were finally mediatised. The fortifications were razed in 1813, when Upper Carinthia formed the northernmost part of the French-occupied Illyrian Provinces. During the Revolutions of 1848, several citizens on March 20 proclaimed an independent \\"Republic of Sachsenburg\\", they were however immediately suppressed by the Austrian military. The Sachsenburg municipality originated in 1850, it was merged with neighbouring M√∂llbr√ºcke and Pusarnitz into the market town of Lurnfeld, but regained independence in 1992.

During this period, Wrapped acquired a finalist position in the 2006 Nedbank Art's and Culture Trust Awards, for its contribution to culture in South Africa. The magazine has been actively involved in various awareness projects, as well as charity campaigns. With the annual Sisters With Blisters walk (money donated for abused women and children) the magazine took part in walking three kilometres in high heels. Even sporty and muscular Albert \\"Al\\" Lotter participated in a pair of green- turquoise stiletto heels. When interviewed as to why he took part, he said \\"It's abusing yourself for women and kids who suffer, except this is self- inflicted. I will probably have blisters on my blisters after this.\\" The editor is a known activist and charity supporter, he has often donated money to worthy causes all over South Africa. Wrapped is headquartered in Pretoria, with international distribution points. The magazine title was bought over in May 2007. Morne Ebersohn assumed the role of publisher from Edition 12 of the magazine. Under his direction, the magazine has been repackaged to cater to the 25- to 35-year-old gay man living in metropolitan areas. The magazine became the first South African Gay Lifestyle magazine to advertise on television, radio, cinema and the internet. Wrapped became the first gay publication in South Africa to become Audit Bureau of Circulation (ABC) certified. Advertising support for the magazine has increased since the magazine was repackaged to become a truly lifestyle magazine. Wrapped TV was launched as a new brand in March 2008. The Wrapped TV Channel which is run on the YouTube platform will give viewers a behind the scene view of what happens at Wrapped Magazine. During December 2008 a decision was made give Wrapped a cover to cover redesign. Edition 20 of Wrapped went on sale during the last week of April 2009 and the feedback on the magazine was overwhelming. The new design focussed on a much cleaner and more relevant magazine for the Wrapped target audience.

They were sent out on July 17, 1865, in Chicago, Illinois. Battle of Gettysburg During the Gettysburg Campaign, the 8th Illinois Cavalry was in the division of Brig. Gen. John Buford. They deployed west of Gettysburg on June 30, 1863, under the command of Colonel William Gamble, and waited for oncoming Confederates that arrived early the following morning. The first shot of the subsequent battle was fired by Lieutenant Marcellus E. Jones of Company E, who borrowed a carbine from Sergeant Levi Shafer and fired at an unidentified officer on a gray horse over a half-mile away.

It is a large breed, with some individuals weighing over , bred for horse meat, agricultural work and leisure pursuits. Overall, members of the breed are solid and muscular in appearance. They are usually bay or bay roan in color, although some other colors are accepted by the breed registry, and are known for their power and docility. The Auxois is a direct descendant of the Bourguignon of the Middle Ages. In the 19th century, blood was added from other French draft breeds before the creation of a stud book in 1912. After the creation of the stud book, only purebred Auxois or Ardennais and Trait du Nord crosses could be registered. World War I interrupted efforts to set the breed standard, but testing resumed in 1920, and between then and World War II the Auxois was the pride of regional farmers. The breed reached its peak in the 1930s, but by the 1960s began to decline with the advent of mechanization. By the 1970s, the Auxois had almost become extinct, and the French government began pushing the breeding of all native draft horses for meat production, as opposed to agricultural usage. However, the meat of the Auxois was not considered high quality, and this, combined with a lower-than-expected market for meat, led to a continued decline in French draft horse populations. In the 1990s, the French government reversed its position on breeding for meat, and began promoting draft breeds for leisure pursuits. The Auxois continues to be rare, having the eighth-smallest population numbers of the nine native French draft breeds. An annual breed show is held in Semur-en-Auxois, and the Auxois is frequently seen at the Paris International Agricultural Show. Breed characteristics The head and neck of an Auxois at the Cluny Stud The Auxois is a horse of great size, larger than the Ardennais and almost as large as the Trait du Nord. It is massively muscular in build, built for heavy pulling. The average height is , with an ideal height of to for stallions and for mares. They weigh from to more than , depending on whether an individual horse is bred for meat, agricultural work or leisure pursuits. The head is relatively short, with a wide forehead. The neck is also relatively short and muscular, the shoulders long and sloping and the chest wide and deep. The body is solid, with a broad, short back and loins. The hindquarters are well-muscled. The legs are robust, although they can appear small in relation to the mass of the body. They usually have less feathering on the legs than other French draft horse breeds. Horses registered with the studbook may be branded on the left side of the neck with the letters \\"TX\\". This brand is generally applied during breed competitions, and only after the age of two. Auxois horses are usually bay or bay roan in color, although they can also be chestnut or red roan, similar to the Ardennais.Collective 1951, p. 151 gray and seal brown (the latter called black pangar√© by the breed registry, although these horses are genetically brown, not black with pangar√© markings) are also accepted for registration; all other colors are excluded. The Auxois is known for its power and docility, having a calm and gentle temperament. Like the Ardennais, it is an easy keeper, able to survive outdoors in all seasons, even in the harsh climatic conditions sometimes seen in Morvan and Nievre. The majority of Auxois are still bred for meat production, and in 2001, 50% of the horses bred were intended for slaughter. However, the power and gaits of the breed make them valued for competitive and leisure driving, as well as equestrian tourism. The smaller horses of the breed are used for milk production. The Auxois is used for celebrations, such as weddings, and historical reenactments. It is also used for logging, and in recent years, has been increasingly used in agriculture, being found in vineyards, gardens and farms. The use of them for the maintenance of rural roads is also in planning.Collective 2002, p. 109 History An Ardennais horse, one of the breeds used to create the Auxois The history of the Auxois is closely tied to its homeland, for which it is named. The rich pastures of the Auxois area, including the French Gold Coast, parts of Yonne, the Sa√¥ne-et-Loire and northern Ni√®vre, are conducive to the breeding of large draft horses.Bataille, p. 136Sourdillat, p. 330 The recognition of the Auxois dates back to the early 20th century, making it relatively new compared to other French draft breeds.Sourdillat, p. 332 The Auxois is a direct descendant of the Bourguignon of the Middle Ages, a small, robust, tough horse used for riding and driving. A now-discredited theory once held that the Auxois was a descendant of the even older Solutre horse, the bones of which were found in the area where the breed was developed.Collective 2002, p. 108 Originally the Morvan horse also existed in the same area, but was absorbed into the Auxois after extensive crossbreeding. During the 1840s, Percheron blood was introduced to the breed, followed by Boulonnais blood in the 1860s and Ardennais and possibly Nivernais blood in the late 19th century. Care was not taken to fix a specific breed type, though, and so the physical characteristics were variable.Sourdillat, p. 336 Breeders introduced foreign stallions before creating a stud book for the breed. The breed took its name from the \\"rich valley of Auxois\\", where the crossbreeding and selection for the new breed took place.Lizet, p. 232 The local mares created from 19th century breeding were crossed with Ardennais and Trait du Nord stallions, sought after for their large size and power, which made them valuable for agricultural work. The birthplace of the breed is around the Cluny Stud, and it was originally considered to be a sub-type of the Ardennais breed.Bataille, p. 135 The first attempts to create a breed registry in 1903 and 1904 failed. In 1912, another attempt was made, this time successful, and a stud book was created in Dijon in 1913. With the creation of the stud book, only purebred Auxois or Ardennais and Trait du Nord crosses could be registered.Collective 1951, p. 152 However, by 1917, the physical characteristics of the breed were still not fixed, and leaders of the equine community were critical, and doubtful of whether the Auxois was a breed in its own right or still merely a subtype of the Ardennais. They were also unsure whether it was a good idea to accept the recognition of another regional breed, of which France had many.Lizet, p. 233 World War I and World War II World War I interrupted the efforts to secure a breed standard, with stud book selection not resuming until 1920. Within a few years, the ideal height was set around , and its breeding spread throughout Auxois and neighboring regions. Between World War I and World War II, the Auxois was the pride of regional farmers. Before the advent of motorization, it was the preferred pulling animal, even for slow work, winning out over the local Charolais cattle breed used as oxen. The Auxois was bred solely for agricultural work, and used exclusively for this purpose.Bataille, p. 137 The strongest horses were used for multi-horse hitches in the fields and for logging. The Auxois competed in popularity with the Nivernais horse, and it was not uncommon for farmers in the region to have both the black-coated Nivernais and the red-coated Ardennais and Auxois to satisfy the color preferences of all potential buyers.Lizet, pp. 234‚Äì236 In the early 1930s the Auxois reached the peak of its physical development.Mavre, p. 38 It was described, like the Ardennais and the Trait du Nord, as a born plowhorse, with a neck naturally held so low that the nose almost touched the ground. It was developed entirely for traction, and its conformation allowed it to move huge weights over short distances.Mavre, p. 42 At the same time, it became more popular than the Nivernais, and was considered a southern representation of the Ardennais breed. Merchants visiting Burgundy horse fairs appreciated the breed, and deemed its bay coloration better able to hide dirt than that of the light gray Percheron or black Nivernais.Lizet, p. 260 The peak populations and usage of the Auxois and other French draft horses was short due to the advent of mechanization in the 1960s.Mavre, p. 43 Post-war to 1990s During World War II, fuel stocks were used by the armies, and were unavailable to farmers. This allowed horses to remain a key aspect of agriculture and transportation until the end of the war.Mavre, p. 66 After the war, farmers rapidly mechanized their operations. The Auxois and other draft breeds were quickly abandoned in favor of machines, and population numbers began to fall in the early 1950s and collapsed completely in the 1960s.Mavre, pp. 34‚Äì35 By the 1970s, the Auxois had almost disappeared, although many villages in the breed's homeland retained a small number of mares for traditional competitions. In the early 1970s, Henry Blanc was appointed as the new director of the French National Stud, and began the conversion of French draft breeds into animals bred for slaughter into horse meat. The stud encouraged farmers who could no longer find buyers for their animals to fatten them for resale to the slaughter markets. Breeding for the production of meat helped to safeguard the Auxois breed by keeping its gene pool intact, but also transformed the previously powerful breed into one bred solely for weight ‚Äî the main consideration in pricing at slaughter. In 1976, an official French decree changed the name of the category in which the Auxois fit from \\"draft horses\\" to \\"heavy horses\\" and encouraged farmers to select the heaviest breeding stallions possible, to increase the average weight of the breed. The National Stud approved this change,Mavre, p. 31 and between the 1950s and the 1980s, the average weight of the Auxois increased from to or more.Mavre, p. 150 In ridden competition at the 2011 Salon International de l'Agriculture The conversion to meat was unfavorable for the Auxois, however. The Percheron was preferred for the quality of the meat and the Ardennais and closely related Auxois were considered to have some of the lowest quality meat.Lizet, p. 263 In addition, the promised market for horse meat did not materialize, and French slaughterhouses were overwhelmed by imports of cheap horses from the Americas and Eastern Europe. Because of this lack of profitability, the population of most French breeds, including the Auxois, continued to decline until 1994. The collapse in prices then forced the National Stud to redirect its draft horse-related activities.Collective 2002, pp. 106‚Äì107 In the early 1990s, recreational riding enjoyed a revival in France, while the consumption of horse meat dropped. In 1991, the Agricultural College in Semur-en-Auxois began the production of horse milk using Auxois mares in Bierre-l√®s-Semur. In 1994, the French Official Journal published a decree restoring the name of \\"draft horse\\" from the almost 20-year use of \\"heavy horse\\". In 1996, another decree prohibited the docking of tails of all French horses. French farmers moved towards the production of animals for recreation or agricultural uses, and the National Stud began supporting this aim. In July 1998, a promotional center for the Auxois opened in Bierre-les-Semur, through regional and departmental grants and using the National Stud to promote the breed. It focuses mainly on the training of young horses for riding and driving, and showcases various performances, as well as providing shoeing services and birthing assistance. In 1999, a study was undertaken of Auxois breeders, which showed opposition to changes in the breed. The author recommended expanding the breed standard to open new markets and save the Auxois from extinction. Present A stallion being driven at the Cluny Stud As it has been since the creation of the Auxois stud book, only purebred horses and Ardennes and Trait du Nord crosses are allowed to be registered. This is to ensure selection for the desired breed characteristics, which are now a lighter and more active horse than was seen during the time of breeding for horse meat. Horses bred through artificial insemination and embryo transfer are allowed to be registered; those potentially bred through cloning are not. The Syndicat du Cheval de Trait Auxois (Auxois Draft Horse Association) is the national registry, managing the stud book, breed standard and promotion of the breed. An annual breed competition is held in September in Semur-en-Auxois. The Burgundy region continues to celebrate the breed, and there is a museum dedicated to it in Bierre-les-Semur. The Auxois is also regularly seen at the International Agriculture Show in Paris. The population of Auxois is very low, and it is one of the rarest of the nine French draft horse breeds. In 2001, it had the eighth-smallest population of the nine breeds, making the threats of inbreeding and extinction very real. In 2006, 250 active breeding mares and 32 stallions were reported, with 125 breedersBataille, p. 138 (the term breeder applying to any person owning at least one active breeding mare). The Auxois represented 1 percent of total French draft horse registrations in 2007. Burgundy is by far the main breeding area, with a few horses in the Rh√¥ne- Alpes and Auvergne regions. There are no known registered Auxois living outside France and it is almost unknown outside of its home region, even within the rest of France. Of the nine French draft horse breeds, the Auxois is the only one that is not exported. Between 1992 and 2011, between 80 and 146 foals were born each year, with numbers ranging from 105 to 128 between 2007 and 2011.

He was most often known as Neil McQueen or E. Neil McQueen. Early life and training Born at Carlton North, Victoria,McQueen Family Genealogy (accessed:04-23-2007) McQueen was the fourth son of Rev. Finlay McQueen, a minister at Skipton, near Ballarat, and his wife Emma Selina Bruton. McQueen's parents had earlier emigrated from the Scottish Highlands. McQueen was educated at his local primary school, performing so well that he received an open scholarship to the Scotch College, Melbourne. At Scotch, McQueen proved himself as a scholar, becoming dux in classics in 1906 and winning a scholarship to Ormond College at Melbourne University in classics and mathematics. He was also a talented tennis player and track and field athlete. McQueen had originally wanted to study medicine at university, but was persuaded by his father to take up arts. He was awarded a number of exhibitions and graduated first place in his final honours exam. In 1910 he won the Wyselaskie Scholarship, which enabled him to take his M.A. degree. On 13 April 1913 he married Florence Isabel Dunn of Northcote, with whom he had four children, Ewen Garth (born 1916), Patricia (born 1925), Sheila and Barry (born 1931).Dunn & Brigden Family Trees (accessed:04-23-2007) After graduating from university, McQueen went to the University of London where he studied both general and experimental psychology, taking out a first class honours degree in science. He continued his research in psychology at the Psychological Laboratory of University College London, specialising in testing and measurement, where he was supervised by Professor Charles Spearman, one of the early psychometricians. McQueen focused his work on the \\"Distribution of Attention\\" in individuals, rejecting earlier claims that there were certain individuals types who possessed general powers of an extensive attention span capable of taking on a number of tasks at the same time. The result of this study was published in the British Journal of Psychology as a monograph supplement in 1917. The time spent in London was important for McQueen as it allowed him to come into contact with the latest British educational thinking. It was at this time that were sown the seeds of his later \\"radical\\" approach to education. Career On his arrival back in Melbourne, McQueen intended on enlisting but was asked to assist at a state school in Gippsland. Three months later, in 1916, he returned to teach in Melbourne, and shortly after was appointed Vice-principal of two Sydney 'sister' schools: the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Croydon and the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Pymble. In 1920, the principal of these two schools, Dr. John Marden resigned due to ill health, and McQueen was subsequently made Principal of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Croydon (P.L.C). It was here that McQueen gained his reputation as a \\"radical\\" and innovative educator. During McQueen's first three years at P.L.C, he made only minor changes to existing policies and routines, preferring to do as Marden had before him. It is said that at this time he may have even been more conservative than Marden, for example, in 1921, he recommended to College Council that no Roman Catholic should be appointed to the staff, whereas Marden had appointed Roman Catholics. McQueen did however campaign for playing fields and a swimming pool at the school, believing that sport should play an important role in the education of young ladies, a somewhat unorthodox idea at the time. His other change in these early years was to allow the pupils a greater say in the election of the School Captain and Prefects. By 1922, McQueen seemed to be established as the principal, and the school was prospering with its highest enrolments ever seen, and he obviously thought it time to introduce changes in line with his own philosophy. The first tangible product of this philosophy was the institution of the school's own Intermediate Leaving Certificate which more accurately represented what his school stood for. He did not think that the State's Intermediate Certificate did so, concentrating as it did on exams only. As McQueen said: The school's certificate was awarded not purely on exam results but on the record of a girl throughout her whole course. It was only awarded after a girl had reached the required standard in scholarship, sport and school life. The girls had to demonstrate \\"on the playing fields and in the school life that they possess those qualities of womanhood for which the school stands,\\" These certificates became keenly sought after and were very highly prized by the girls of the college. McQueen's next change occurred in that same year, when Lindley Evans was appointed as music teacher. McQueen believed that the teachers appointed to his school should not only have great ability in their chosen field, but also have imagination and be prepared to be innovators. McQueen saw this in Evans and felt that he could lift the standard of music at the school. This did indeed happen. For many years, P.L.C won the coveted 'Dempster Shield' for choral singing. The school won it so many times in fact, that the shield became the permanent property of the school. In 1923 McQueen became more innovative still. He reorganised the school along the lines of the Dalton Plan, an educational concept created by Helen Parkhurst. This scheme originated in Massachusetts, and was based on the importance of experience and of allowing the pupil to be \\"free to continue his work upon any subject in which he is absorbed.\\" It also encouraged the \\"interaction of group life.\\" McQueen's arrangement was a modified version of the original Dalton Plan. At least one formal class lesson was given in each subject each week. During the rest of the week, about half the periods, students spent their time in practical work, reading texts and other references under the direction of a teacher who was available for individual and/or group consultation. All work was divided into monthly portions and set out in \\"Monthly Assignments\\". Charts in each subject room indicated pupils' progress in that subject and pupils kept their own progress charts as well. Girls who fell behind were required to make up their work on Thursday and Friday afternoons. The reaction of the girls was, on the whole, favourable with the senior girls \\"almost unanimously\\" in favour of it. Younger girls however found it harder to adapt as they \\"had got into the habit of depending on teachers for everything\\". Two surveys of the scheme among the girls and staff twelve months apart indicated that most were in favour, especially as time went on. The Dalton Plan was McQueen's major reform and by it he attempted to transform the whole school. He was however also greatly influenced by at least two other teaching procedures. The first of these was the project methods which was based on the ideas of W. H. Kilpatrick who in turn was influenced by John Dewey. The project method set out to \\"allow children to follow their own ways in purpose, planning and execution and judgement.\\" Many other schools at the time were also introducing similar methods based on Kilpatrick's work. The other influence on McQueen was \\"The Play Way\\" of H. Caldwell Cook which stressed the importance of \\"original thought and fancy\\" in children's activities. The outcome of these two philosophies on the school was the use of drama (often in the form of pageant's) to aid self-expression and the introduction of lectures and self- government. In 1926 McQueen introduced some peer assessment, whereby girls' estimates of each other's work and worth was taken into consideration in the allocation of prizes. As McQueen said: McQueen also introduced a house system, school camps to Mittagong, and a course in infant care that same year. Resignation A number of school pageants and open days to show the Dalton Plan at work enabled McQueen to give practical demonstration of his theories. Overall, they were enthusiastically received. However, the conservative P.L.C Council remained unimpressed. In August 1923, the Chairman of Council, Rev. John Ferguson, retired due to ill health. Up until this stage it appeared that Council was quite happy with McQueen's new ideas and organisation, however, as soon as Ferguson had retired, relations began to deteriorate between McQueen and Council. On 15 November 1923, the new Chairman of Council, Mr R. W. Gillespie, chaired his first council at Croydon. At this meeting the matter of the College's own Intermediate Certificate was raised. It was moved that: This motion was later withdrawn due to McQueen's powers of persuasion. However, McQueen's problems were not over. Council moved to reduce his authority by insisting that he produce a Principal's report for each Council meeting. This also highlighted Gillespie's lack of confidence in him as this had never before been the practice at Croydon, nor was it the case at Gillespie's other school, Knox Grammar School. This clash of personalities continued for another six years with the authority of the Principal being eaten away year by year. Despite this tension, McQueen remained undaunted. He continued to advocate and suggest ideas and plans which he wanted implemented for the good of the school and the girls. In 1926 P.L.C Croydon began to show a financial loss and enrolments began to fall. Council's concern at the \\"deteriorating\\" situation was manifest by further attacks on McQueen over the manner in which he was managing the school. As the situation worsened, so did Council's relations with McQueen. As a result, a committee was formed to investigate the management of the school. In May 1929, McQueen was given leave to travel overseas and present his paper in person about his work at P.L.C. The leave was to be for two terms. In his absence, the committee investigation laid all the school's problems at McQueen's feet. It recommended sweeping changes to the curriculum, the abandoning of the Dalton Plan, because of the unhelpful effects on discipline, and finally: McQueen was informed of this decision and cut his leave short, returning from overseas. At a meeting on 11 December 1929, Council unanimously resolved that Dr McQueen's appointment be terminated. Rev. A. M. Ogilvie, Minister at Beecroft, apologised for his absence and by letter indicated that he opposed the motion. He was McQueen's sole supporter. Subsequently, Messrs R. Vicars and F. Thompson interviewed McQueen to \\"invite his resignation\\". McQueen, gentleman to the end, advised Council to take any action that it deemed necessary. McQueen's \\"resignation\\" agreement was that he would be paid ¬£1,209 in lieu of notice and that his two daughters would be accepted at the College at the pleasure of Council, as day scholars free of ordinary school fees. When news of McQueen's \\"resignation\\" became known, a number of parents were said to be outraged by the Council's action and withdrew their daughters immediately, thereby, incidentally, worsening the enrolment situation. A number of staff resigned in protest, Lindley Evans among them. The P.L.C. Speech Day of 1929 clearly illustrated the degree of support for McQueen among parents and students. It is said that when the official party came on stage, there was no applause until McQueen appeared. Vicars, the chairman for the occasion, referred to McQueen once towards the end of the ceremony but was drowned out by cheering and clapping \\"during which Council were a peculiar greenish hue about the face, especially Gillespie and Vicars.\\" Further, after the National Anthem was sung and the officials were about to leave the stage, Rev. William Duffy, Minister at Wollongong and a parent of a P.L.C student, stood up and asked the chairman to be seated. He said that McQueen had been wronged and what was more, he was not even allowed to say good-bye. Council subsequently rushed out quickly and locked themselves in the dining room. In the Assembly Hall all was confusion with everyone cheering, stamping their feet and shouting. The stamping continued for so long that the Hall became full of dust, making it hard to see. Eventually, Mr. Duffy was able to quieten the gathering and McQueen was able to speak. He thanked those who had helped him and added: Parent and ex- student protest meetings followed, and the matter was taken up in the press, however all efforts failed. McQueen is often remembered by ex-students as a great man who made learning interesting and relevant. Later years After leaving P.L.C., McQueen returned to his first love, medicine, at the University of Sydney. After graduating, he practised successfully as a general practitioner in the Ashfield district of Sydney for many years. McQueen died in 1967. He was survived by his wife and four children.

Early life Taylor was born on 16 June 1862 in Kirton in Lindsey, Lincolnshire, England, the son of Edward Taylor and his wife, Anne Turner. The Taylors emigrated to New Zealand in 1873, arriving at Lyttelton on the Cardigan Castle on 15 November. They settled in Addington. Taylor briefly continued his education at Christchurch West School but left in 1874 for employment. For nearly 20 years, Taylor was employed by Heywood and Co (forwarding agents) and was their manager for several years. In February 1895, he became self-employed as a real estate agent and importer. Political life=Member of Parliament  Taylor stood in the City of Christchurch by-election on 13 February 1896 against Charles Lewis and Richard Molesworth Taylor. Lewis won with a majority of 402 votes, with Tommy Taylor coming second. He contested the City of Christchurch electorate at the 1896 general election in December and this time was returned as a Member of Parliament. He held this seat until 1899 and from 1902 to 1905. Taylor contested the Christchurch North electorate in the 1905 general election, but lost against Charles Gray. He contested this seat again and represented Christchurch North from 1908 to 27 July 1911. Taylor sat as an Independent Liberal-Labour MP and received endorsement from the Labour movement. His death caused a by-election, which was won by Leonard Isitt. Independent MP Taylor was an Independent MP. In 1905 he became the leader of the New Liberal Party. He opposed the Premier Richard Seddon of the Liberal Party over government corruption, and Seddon's support for the Licensed Trade (i.e., the Liquor Industry) and the Boer War in South Africa. Other Independent MPs associated with Taylor were George Laurenson, Leonard Isitt, Harry Bedford and Francis Fisher. Mayor of Christchurch Tommy Taylor grave at Addington Cemetery Taylor was an advocate of \\"Municipal Socialism\\" and was endorsed by the Labour Party in his campaign for the Christchurch mayoralty in 1911, but he never joined a labour organisation. On 27 April 1911, he was elected Mayor of Christchurch, defeating the incumbent, Charles Allison, and Henry Thacker. Taylor died shortly thereafter on 27 July 1911. His funeral was the largest ever known in Christchurch.An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand (1966) accessed 6 January 2010 Life outside politics Taylor was a successful importer and estate agent in Christchurch. He married Elizabeth Best Ellison in 1892. They had five daughters, and one son, Edward Bickmore Ellison Taylor, who was a member of the Christchurch City Council between 1968 and 1971. Taylor died of a perforated gastric ulcer at Christchurch on 27 July 1911. Such was the respect he commanded that 50,000 people lined the streets of the city for his funeral procession. James McCombs, Secretary of the Christchurch Prohibition League and later a Labour Party MP, paid tribute to his co-worker and friend: > He had a worldwide outlook. There was no country, no nation, no social > movement that did not command his interest. He had a passion for freedom, > and his whole career was inspired by the desire that men should have the > fullest opportunity for untrammelled development. His wife died in April 1941.

Located at Annaghmakerrig, Newbliss, County Monaghan, Ireland, it was founded in 1981. The house was the family home of theatrical director Sir Tyrone Guthrie, and he bequeathed it to the Irish nation in 1971, to be used as an artistic retreat. The centre is a residential workplace open to professional practitioners in all art forms. Creative residencies (or artistic retreats) are for periods of from two weeks to three to six months. History Tyrone Guthrie left, in his will: : ...my said dwelling-house, furniture, pictures and chattels and the income of my residuary estate to be used for the purpose of providing a retreat for artists and other like persons ... so as to enable them to do or facilitate them in doing creative work. The gift of the house, in 1971, was accepted by the Irish government, and it opened to guests in 1981. Facilities The retreat centre is sited within a gated wooded estate. In the main residence, the \\"Big House,\\" guests are catered for, with food partly supplied from the estate's organic gardens. Each bedroom includes a writing or work desk and chair, and has its own selection of books and paintings, and a view. Ten of the rooms have en- suite bathrooms and most have fireplaces. Linen and towels are provided. Up to seven guests can stay in the five self-catering cottages, each with a small stove. Eight well-lit and heated studio spaces are also available, along with a performance/dance space opened in 2006. Approach Residencies at the centre are by application only, and are selective. Applicants must have some track record in their field. Once granted, residences are for up to three months for those seeking and accepted for the \\"Big House\\" and up to six months for those in the self-catering \\"Farmyard Cottages.\\" Accommodation fees are modest, and there are some bursaries available to at least partly defray them for qualified candidates. Once resident, guests are welcome to work as they wish. The only stipulation, as set out in the donor's will, is that all guests must gather nightly for a communal dinner, generally held at 7 p.m., and nowadays in the kitchen of the Big House. Notable guests The centre has since hosted more than 5,000 retreats, with the list of Irish writers, composers and artists including such as Seamus Heaney, Brian Friel, Sebastian Barry, Anne Enright, John Banville, Colm T√≥ib√≠n and Colum McCann as well as Michael Harding, Oonagh Kearney, Derval Symes, Page Allen, Maurice Craig, Rory Pierce, Roisin Meaney, Anne Rigney, Nell McCafferty, Gemma Browne, Sam McAughtry, Colette Bryce, Phil Coulter, Brian Kennedy, Mary Dorcey, Nuala N√≠ Chonch√∫ir and Peter McCann. International authors have also completed residencies at the centre, assisting them to complete or polish existing writing projects. These have included Australian authors Luke Davies and Linda Jaivin and British author Bella Pollen, and Canadian musician Loreena Mckennitt. Management The first Director of the centre was Bernard Loughlin (1981-1999), who managed it with his wife, and oversaw its initial setup and the reintegration of the estate. Loughlin was succeeded by Regina Doyle in an acting capacity (1999-2001), then by Sheila Pratschke (2001-2007), Pat Donlon (2007-2010) and Robbie McDonald (since 2010). Bursaries Among the many bursaries covering the cost of accommodation at the centre are: * Noelle Vial bursary for young poets - Donegal County Council Arts Office * The Arts Office of Clare County Council * Francis Ledwidge bursary * Roe Valley Arts and Heritage Committee * The Next Generation programme from the Arts Council of Ireland * Joe Dowling Annaghmakerrig Fellowship Award Publication To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the retreat centre in 2016, a book with a selection of materials from projects connected to the facility (imagined, advanced or finished there) was published. Entitled simply \\"Annaghmakerrig,\\" it was edited by the centre's then director, Sheila Pratschke, working with two selectors, Evelyn Conlon for writing and Ruairi O Cuiv for visual art, and contains work exclusively by guests of the centre, including Colm Toibin, Joseph O'Connor, Alice Maher, Patrick Scott, Rosita Boland, John Banville, Claire Keegan, Gerald Barry, and a remembrance of Guthrie as theare director by Eugene McCabe, and a childhood memoir by Joseph Hone.

On 17 July 2000, while on approach to its first stopover in Patna, the Boeing 737-2A8 operating the route nose-dived and crashed into a residential area in Patna, killing 60 people including 5 on the ground. The final report, investigated by the Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation, concluded that the cause of the crash was due to pilot error. Initially, the Bihar Air Traffic Controller was blamed as the cause of the accident. Even after the official final report was published, most residents who lived near the crash site, along with the relatives of those who perished on the flight, believed that ATC error was the cause of the accident. Accident Flight 7412 departed Calcutta (Kolkata) at 06:51 on 17 July 2000, for a flight to Delhi, with stops at Patna and Lucknow. Patna ATC asked the aircraft at 07:17 to report for descent and also to check descent traffic with Kolkata Area Control. The aircraft soon responded that Kolkata had reported negative traffic. Flight 7412 was then cleared for descent to FL75 and asked to report 25 NM and the same was reported by the aircraft at 07:26. Flight 7412 was cleared to descend to 4000 ft. and was asked to report for approach runway 25. At 07:28, Flight 7412 reported commencing the turn and at 07:31 reported crossing the airport area and coming up on the localiser. Flight 7412 was then asked to descend to 1700 ft. The crew had been cleared to land at runway 25 at Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Airport at Patna when the pilots requested a 360-degree orbit due to the flight being high on the approach. Permission was granted and a left turn was initiated. During the left turn, the aircraft stalled. The plane then grazed a few single-storied houses in a government residential housing estate and crashed in a government residential colony behind Gardani Bagh Girls School at Anishabad, which is located about 2 km southwest of the Patna Airport. The aircraft broke into four pieces. When the aircraft struck the residential quarters and the ground, the impact was severe. The intensity of post impact fire was also severe. Initially, seven passengers were extricated alive. Of them, six were seriously injured. Miraculously, one of the passengers walked out of the wreckage without much injury even though he had a minor concussion and was treated later. Of the six injured passengers, four died subsequently. Two passengers recovered completely after treatment. The airport ambulance had proceeded to the crash site along with the CFTs. Two injured passengers were transported to the PMCH in the first instance. Subsequently, the second ambulance from the airport was also pressed into service to transport the remaining injured passengers for medical aid. Shortly after the arrival of the airport ambulance, ambulances from other assisting agencies also arrived and helped in removing all the injured for medical aid. Failures in Rescue Services The accident site was 5‚Äì6 km from the airport. The fire personnel reached the site in 5 to 6 minutes (local residents stated that the tenders reached only after 15‚Äì20 minutes). The first Crash Fire Tender (CFT) laid two hoses and began to fight the fire; however, it failed in 3 minutes. After failing in their efforts to rectify the fault, the CFT crew had to call a mechanic from the airport and the CFT was put back into operation after an hour. However, after a few minutes of operation, it went back to the airport to refill water. On the way it broke down twice. The second CFT after a few minutes of operation had to return to the airport to refill water. The crowd that collected within a short time was unmanageable and definitely hampered the rescue operations. According to witnesses, crowd tempers ran high and there was a general tendency to target anybody in uniform or position of authority with verbal abuse and physical violence. At times there were hundreds of people trying to climb on to the rescue vehicles to get a better view. It was only after the arrival of the Bihar military police jawans and the army contingent that some semblance of crowd control was achieved. Aircraft The aircraft involved in the accident was a Boeing 737-200. Boeing 737-200 is a twin-engine jet transport airplane manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplane Company, USA. It is designed to operate over short to medium ranges at cruise speeds of approximately 950 kilometres per hour (km/h). Two P&W; JT8D/17A engines power the aircraft, each developing approximately 16,000 pounds (lbf) of thrust at sea level. The aircraft involved in the accident was registered in India as VT-EGD with a serial number of MSN22280. The aircraft was manufactured in 1980 and sold to Indian Airlines. It was subsequently leased to Alliance Air in 1999. Investigation The aircraft in question, VT-EGD, had been involved in an earlier accident. On 15 January 1986, the pilot of flight 529 attempted to land at Tiruchirapalli in conditions below weather minima (reported Wx was exactly the minima). During a go-around (wave-off, just before touch down) the wing contacted the runway due to an excessive bank angle (the delay in spool- up times for both engines were more than 5 seconds apart with the right engine slow). The HIALS was not switched on at the time 529 was approaching and the ATC anemometer was unserviceable. The wing was substantially damaged, but there were no injuries among the 6 crew and 122 passengers. The pilot displayed great skill in manually flying the B737 at FL100 and diverted to Chennai and landed safely with flight controls in \\"manual reversion\\" on runway 07 The aircraft was to be phased out by the end of the year per Indian government guidelines which do not allow aircraft over 20 years old to operate in Indian airspace. Investigators ruled out terrorism as the cause of the accident. They didn't find any signs of explosion nor a fire had occurred in flight. Both pilots were not intoxicated and fully aware at the time of the crash. The flight crew consisted of Captain Manjit Singh Sohanpal and co-pilot Arvind Singh Bagga. A criminal case, filed against them based on the statement of a surviving passenger, was later withdrawn. Both Captain Sohanpal and co- pilot Bagga died in the accident. A TAESA Boeing 737 with the rudder (yellow) visible. Investigators later conducted an observation with its Rudder Power Control Unit (PCU). The Main Power Control Unit (MPCU) of the rudder has been a subject of intense debate and discussions and has undergone mandatory modifications as a result of some previous accident investigations. The PCU has responsible for several high-profile crashes, such as United Airlines Flight 585, USAir Flight 427, and Eastwind Airlines Flight 517. Flight 7412 nose-dived before the crash, as well as two previous crashes, Flight 585 and Flight 427. The rudder locked up in a particular direction, and reversal of rudder to that of the commanded position (anomalous rudder movements such as un-commanded movements). These have been attributed to the secondary slide jamming with the primary slide due to contamination or adverse buildup of tolerances during manufacture. However, investigators later dismissed it and ruled out the failure of the PCU as the cause, and concluded that it was serviceable and was in good condition. As both black boxes were found by search and rescue teams, investigators tore into both black boxes and analyzed their contents. The results showed that the engines were at idle thrust throughout the descent profile and the speed was continuously reducing. It was not clear why the engines were kept at idle thrust even after selecting Flaps 40. It was perhaps because the aircraft was higher than normal on approach. If the intention was to regain the correct glide path then classic flying technique would have required the Pilot to maintain speed by reducing the angle of attack by pushing the control column forward while allowing the aircraft to regain the correct glide path with an increased rate of descent. When it was realized that the aircraft was too high to effect a landing, a 360¬∞ orbit was requested. The landing reference speed or threshold crossing speed at this time was 119 knots, the landing speed. The procedure to carry out a 360¬∞ turn was not an authorised procedure as per the Alliance Air Operations Manual and could have caused confusion in the mind of First Officer Arvind. It was clear from the FDR recording that the aircraft was not following the ILS procedure but Patna ATC was being given the impression that the aircraft was doing so. At any busy airport, this would have been unthinkable and would have created a conflict. However, there was no other traffic for miles around Patna and ATC gave the permission after confirming that the crew had the airfield in sight. Captain Manjit tried to resolve this issue without any discussion with First Officer Arvind. The atmosphere in the cockpit was relaxed and tension free till 15 seconds before the crash. The first sign of anxiety became apparent only when Arvind called for raising the landing gear. Investigators conducted a simulation of the crash and found that at 16 seconds before the crash, the spooling up of the engine had reduced the rate of descent. However, eight seconds later when the Flap Lever was moved to 15, the rate of descent increased as seen by the steepening of the slope of the curve. This was caused by loss of lift due to the reduction in wing area as the flaps moved up from 40 to 15. Six seconds after the flap Lever was moved to 15, the rate of descent increased even further indicating that the flaps were close to 15 position and the wing no longer generated enough lift to support the aircraft. This high rate of descent together with the high Nose Up pitch attitude held by the pilot resulted in the aircraft attaining a very high angle of attack of the order of 26o. The aircraft had completely stalled by this time and even though thrust had been increased to the maximum possible on both engines, recovery was not possible. The final investigation noted pilot error as the cause of the plane crash. According to the panel, the crew had not followed the correct approach procedure, which resulted in the aircraft being high on approach. The engines had been kept at idle thrust, which allowed the airspeed to decline below the allowed minimum for approach and caused the aircraft to stall. The inquiry also pointed out that the airport had \\"several operational constraints, resulting in erosion of safety margins for the operation of Airbus 320s and Boeing 737s.\\" Controversy There were a number of aspersions cast on the maintenance of flights by Alliance Air, with the then civil aviation minister Sharad Yadav reportedly unhappy with the maintenance of the aircraft and asking for replacement of a number of additional aircraft. Some reports even claimed that one of the engines was on fire before the crash. However, the investigation clearly said the aircraft was fully airworthy and properly maintained.

Hallahan Catholic Girls' High School is an all-girls Roman Catholic high school located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States within the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. History A Roman Catholic High School for Boys had been established in 1890 at Broad and Vine streets through the philanthropy of Thomas E. Cahill, a Philadelphia merchant-entrepreneur. This school was a positive development for education in the city, but unfortunately it was only benefiting the boys at the time. Girls had yet to have a Catholic School available. ‚ÄúThere is an urgent need for the establishment in the City of Philadelphia of a Catholic High School for girls,‚Äù stated Father John W. Shanahan as found in the First Annual Report of the Superintendent of Schools for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia for the year ending June 30, 1895.2010-2011 School Profile Booklet In 1901, Father Philip R. McDevitt, who succeeded Father Shanahan, reported that High School Centres had been organized. There were five such Centres throughout the city. The religious community that served the parish school in which the Centres were located also staffed the High School Centre. There was, however, still the dream of a Catholic girls‚Äô high school. Along with the dream, there was a prayer for a ‚ÄúCatholic Philanthropist:‚Äù to meet the necessity and to endow such a school. The dream was realized in 1908, the centennial year of the diocese, when a devout Catholic lay woman, Mary E. H. McMichan, came forward to offer a gift of sufficient funds toward the establishment of such a school. The building's fa√ßade marks 1911 as the construction year. Since then, thousands of young women have attended. From the beginning of the 20th century, Catholic Girls‚Äô High School, the first Diocesan all-girls Catholic high school in the US, has welcomed ‚Äúthe daughters of the working-class families.‚Äù These girls have been given the advantages of a quality secondary education. At the request of Mary McMichan, in 1925, the school‚Äôs name was prefaced with John W. Hallahan in honor of her brother. Hallahan was granted permission in the mid-1930s to have Mickey Mouse, a registered Disney character, as a mascot. The tradition of jumping into the fountain at Logan Circle started in the 1970s and continues every year on the last day of the school year. The newly appointed Seniors, Juniors and Sophomores jump into the Swann Memorial Fountain and attract the local media in Philadelphia.  Curriculum  The curriculum aims to prepare students to meet all future challenges. Business Department The business and technology department offers several electives to the young ladies at Hallahan.

She began her public career as a singer and collector of traditional folksongs in the late 1950s. During the early 1960s she left her husband and began traveling and performing at music festivals and clubs throughout the United States. She and her five children traveled across the country as she worked to support her family and establish herself as a performer. Along the way she made many lifelong friends among the folk and beat scene. Her career of social activism, storytelling, teaching, learning, songwriting, collecting folk songs, performing, and recording spanned six decades. Accolades Rosalie's first major gig was at the Newport Folk Festival in 1966. Rosalie recorded more than 20 albums including the 2005 Grammy nominated album \\"My Last Go 'Round\\" (Best Traditional Folk Album.) She authored two books and wrote the introduction to her mother's book. In 1990 Sorrels was the recipient of the World Folk Music Association's Kate Wolf Award. In 1999 she received the National Storytelling Network Circle of Excellence Award for \\"exceptional commitment and exemplary contributions to the art of storytelling.\\" In 2000 she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts from the University of Idaho. In 2001 she was awarded the Boise Peace Quilt Award. She had been featured several times on National Public Radio and profiled on Idaho Public Television. Throughout her career, she performed and recorded with other notable folk musicians, including Utah Phillips, Dave Van Ronk, Peggy Seeger and Pete Seeger. Oscar Zeta Acosta, Hunter S. Thompson and Studs Terkel wrote introductory notes for her albums. She was strongly influenced by Malvina Reynolds and went on to record several of her songs on the album What does it mean to love? She credits Reynolds with helping turn rebelliousness from a destructive force into an artistic one. Early life Rosalie Ann Stringfellow was born on June 24, 1933, in Boise, Idaho, to Walter Pendleton Stringfellow and Nancy Ann Kelly. Her parents met while attending Idaho State University in Pocatello. Her father worked for the highway department and the family often travelled with him as he did field work. Her father's parents were Robert Stanton Stringfellow and Rosalie Cope who settled near Idaho City, Idaho, on the Grimes Creek property. Robert was an Episcopal missionary working with various tribes and rural churches in Idaho and Montana. His wife, Rosalie Cope, was a photographer and journalist. The Cope family were journalists in Salt Lake City. Rosalie developed a love of the outdoors while spending summers on Grimes Creek. Her mother's parents were James Madison Kelly and Arabel Beaire who married and settled on a farm in Twin Falls, Idaho, where Rosalie was a frequent visitor. In interviews for a biography of Rosalie, Nancy Stringfellow explained > \\"She finds something ... in a piece of poetry ... that shines out like a > precious jewel, and you can see her cupping her hands and holding it. We all > have a streak of that ... We are delighted with words. We're drunk with > words.\\" During high school Rosalie acted and sang in theatrical productions, garnering praise for her performances in the local media. During this period Rosalie became pregnant and had an illegal abortion. The experience would influence her poetry and song. She earned a scholarship to the University of Idaho, but as a result of a rape, she became pregnant and went to a home for unwed mothers in California to await the birth of her child, a daughter. Again, the experience of making the difficult choice of adoption shows in her later writings and music. Sorrels did not go to college as planned, but returned to Boise after the birth of her child. She acted in local theater and partied with her friends. She recounted that her parents loved her and did not judge her. Married life Jim Sorrels and Rosalie Stringfellow met while performing in theater in Boise, Idaho. Jim worked for the phone company as a lineman and was seven years older than Rosalie. The two married in 1952 and his job took them to Salt Lake City where they opened their home to actors, musicians, and poets living or visiting in the area. They had five children. Rosalie joked that Jim married her to get access to her collection of jazz recordings. Over time, her interest in the folk music of her childhood was piqued and she began to study at the University of Utah with noted folklorist, Wayland Hand. She learned to accompany herself on guitar during this period and attended folklore society meetings and seminars. Early recordings and performance career In 1963 Rosalie began a four-decade relationship with Manny Greenhill and Folklore Productions. She performed with Manny's son, Mitch at the 1966 Newport Folk Festival and produced an album in 1964 for Folk-Legacy Records entitled If I Could Be the Rain. This is her first album which included her original songs, as previous recordings contained her renditions of traditional songs she had collected. She and her children lived for a time with Lena Spencer in Saratoga Springs, New York where she performed at Caff√® Lena. She continued working on her craft, and was one of the performers at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. Sorrels maintained an active performance schedule throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, often touring solo or with close friend Utah Phillips. Reviewing Sorrels' 1971 Sire LP Travelin' Lady, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): \\"Though it's reminiscent of many I-gotta-move-babe male precedents, this is the most independent female persona yet to emerge, but that plaintive country quaver begins to wear after a while.\\" Sorrels was awarded the Kate Wolf Memorial Award by the World Folk Music Association in 1990. Song catching There was a strong tradition in both the Stringfellow and Kelly families to celebrate the written and spoken word. The families encouraged reading and learning for their children and this was passed to the succeeding generations. Writing; whether sermons, magazine articles, poems or Personal journaling, were all activities Rosalie experienced in her youth. She followed in the same path of expressing herself in word by journaling and writing poetry and prose. Songs and music were a natural extension of this interest in words and her love of music began early in life as she listened to her father, Walter Pendleton Stringfellow, sing.https://vimeo.com/135483883 She had access to a scrapbook of folk songs collected by her grandmother, Rosalie Cope Stringfellow. She began her music career collecting folksongs and performing them, first with her husband Jim in the late 1950s, then later on her own. It was during this time that the Smithsonian Institution's Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage recorded Rosalie and Jim performing her collection of traditional songs. Many of these have been released by Smithsonian Folkways Recordings in various compilation albums throughout the last fifty years. Sorrels was a regular in the Utah folk scene in the late 1950s and early 1960s when she and her husband taught folk guitar classes at the University of Utah. She participated in workshops and folk festivals in the area, such as the Utah Folklore Workshop and Festival (1959). In this way she met other folklorists and performers at \\"song swaps\\"; as well as formal sessions. Sorrels also was a concert promoter and brought Joan Baez to Salt Lake City the first time in 1963. Legacy, retirement and death Rosalie Sorrels was a long established figure on the national folk singer-song writer scene. She was well known for her story telling. In its announcement of her death, the Idaho Statesman proclaimed, \\"The legendary folksinger also was known for her ability to spin a yarn and hold an audience in the palm of her hand.\\" Strongly identified with her native state, she held a prominent place in Idaho cultural life. In 2005, health considerations were slowing her pace. By the end of the decade, she had mostly retired to her home on Grimes Creek outside of Boise. Sorrels died on June 11, 2017, at a daughter's home in Reno, Nevada. The Idaho Statesman closes its announcement of Sorrels' passing with her own lyrics from My Last Go Round, a 2004 album. > When my wandering soul shall rest, and my last song gets sung, I'll find the > brightest and the best; On my way back home, all my long lost friends and > lovers, once again they will be found; And I'll kiss all their shining faces > on my last go round. Discography The discography for Rosalie Sorrels includes albums where she is the principal performer as well as tribute albums, retrospective albums, and compilation albums for a theme of songs. Books * ** The Idaho Commission on the Arts asked Sorrels to travel the Idaho to collect the folk history of its people.

These grants include major overseas Otology Fellowships.  History  The TWJ Foundation (Thomas Whickham Jones) was founded in 1954 and became a registered charity on 14 March 1974 through the generosity of Mrs. Lilian Wickham Higgs and her son Thomas. Mrs Higgs herself was deaf and the Foundation was set up in memory of her father Thomas Wickham-Jones (TWJ 1847-1929). His success as a City of London wharfinger was largely instrumental in enabling it to be funded. The Higgs Charitable trust was formed with the intention that it should fund the TWJ. Its trustees have indeed acted from the start as the TWJ's largest benefactor and the TWJ continues to be most grateful to them for their generosity. Patrick Hunter Jobson, a Consultant in Otorhinolaryngology, who had married one of TWJ's granddaughters, became the Foundation's first executive Chairman. Patrick Hunter Jobson gave his time and talents unstintingly during the period to 1994 when so much was achieved. His ideals have been continued through his successor David Wright as Chairman and by the inclusion of John Evans as a Trustee. Objectives The TWJ Foundation's objectives are to benefit otology and audiology within the National Health Service by the promotion of education and research. The Foundation hopes to generate a beneficial influence on clinical otology in the United Kingdom.

She became an actress in B-movie and sci-fi motion pictures of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Her parents were Mr. and Mrs. Edward K. Goude. Her father was the manager of a steel plant in Sandviken. Her mother's name was Valdy. Film contract Goude won the 1956 Miss Sweden beauty pageant. As second runner-up in the 1956 Miss Universe, and 1st runner-up in Miss Europe contests, Goude signed a Universal Pictures film contract on July 25, 1956. The studio also offered contracts to the 1956 Miss Universe, Carol Morris, and Marina Orschel of Germany, the 1st runner-up. Universal picked up her option during Christmas 1956 and requested that she report back to the studio on January 8. Goude won the right to manage all of the earnings from her Universal contract in September 1957. The contract was paying $250 per week at the time. It called for her to invest 20% of her earnings in government bonds. A superior court judge in Los Angeles waived this proviso. He noted that Goude would turn twenty-one on May 26, 1958. Also, he noted, the contract was signed thirteen months earlier, and she had lived within her means since then. Universal started her at $150 weekly with a maturation salary of $800 a week. After eighteen months with Universal, Goude asked for and was granted, her release from her studio agreement in January 1958. Actress Neither Morris nor Orschel was successful in movies. Goude earned a role as a secretary in The Big Beat (1958). The film is studded with musicians like Harry James and Fats Domino in its cast. She played Beulah, a bride, in Once Upon a Horse... (1958). The comedy was written by Dan Rowan and Dick Martin and produced by Universal. Goude trained for this part at the Los Angeles Athletic Club. There she learned to use boxing gloves under the supervision of Duke Llewellyn, athletic director. In July 1957 Goude went to Denver, Colorado, to play hostess for Night Passage (1957), a motion picture starring James Stewart and Audie Murphy. Goude was cast with James Best in January 1959, in The Killer Shrews. A production of the Hollywood Pictures Corporation, the sci-fi movie was filmed on location in Dallas, Texas. Ken Curtis is a co-star in this cult movie, which was backed financially by Gordon and B.R. McClendon. Television In her brief career, Goude played in several television series, including Flight (1957), Steve Canyon (1959‚Äì1960), Johnny Staccato (1959), The Bob Cummings Show (syndicated as Love That Bob) and The Best of the Post (1961). Personal life Goude married Jerome K. Ohrbach ( 1990) in Palm Springs, California, in April 1962. He was president of Ohrbach's department stores. The couple made their home in Beverly Hills after a honeymoon in Europe. She was married to Arthur Ryan from 1976‚Äì1982. After her divorce, she married Fritz Ingram ( 2015).

Geography The lakeside resort is situated on the shore of the Weissensee within the Gailtal Alps mountain range. It can be reached via the Weissensee Road (B 87) leading from Greifenburg in the Drava Valley across the Kreuzberg Saddle to Gitschtal and Hermagor in the Gail Valley. The municipal area comprises the cadastral community of Techendorf.  History  In the centre of the town is a bridge across the lake, first mentioned in a 1348 deed. It was replaced by a reinforced concrete construction in 1967. Protestant church The Catholic church in the village of Gatschach was first documented in 1485. Nevertheless, Weissensee is one of the few municipalities in Austria with a Protestant majority (73.6% as of 2001). Not until the 1781 Patent of Toleration issued by the Habsburg emperor Joseph II could they confess themselves and be allowed to worship in a Bethaus (i.e. \\"pray house\\" ‚Äì explicitly not a church). The present-day Neo-Gothic church in Techendorf was erected from 1900 to 1903. The commune of Techendorf was established in 1850; the name was changed in 1968 for tourist reasons. Summer tourism around the lake is the main component of the local economy. Since 1989, an Alternative Elfstedentocht is organized there by the SWS (Stichting Winter Sporten) on the natural ice rink in winter.

He is the Manager for National League South side Chippenham Townhttps://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/sport/football/football- news/gloucester-city-name-former-coventry- In his playing career, Cook played in the Football League as a midfielder for York City and Cambridge United, after starting his career with an FA Youth Cup win with Coventry City In December 2019 he appeared in court on allegations of dangerous driving. He pleaded guilty to careless driving in February 2020 and was banned from driving due to the number of points he had accrued. Career Born in Stroud, Gloucestershire, Cook started his career in the youth team at Coventry City where he won an FA Youth Cup medal. After a brief spell on loan to York City he signed for Cambridge United on a free transfer in 1989. Cook's career at the Abbey Stadium was blighted by injury; he made only 17 appearances in two seasons. His one goal for the club was a vital one however, scoring at Aldershot to help cement a play-off place at the end of the 1989‚Äì90 season. He was also a substitute at Wembley Stadium for the 1‚Äì0 win over Chesterfield in the final. After another loan spell at York City, a spinal injury forced Cook's retirement from the professional game at the age of 22. He had spells in non-League football with Wycombe Wanderers, Corby Town, Cambridge City, and many other clubs, and worked for Cambridge United as Football in the Community officer. Cook took up a similar post at Cheltenham Town in 1999, alongside spells as assistant manager of Gloucester City and, from September 2004, as manager of Cinderford Town. After ten years with Cheltenham, Cook joined the staff of the Professional Footballers' Association in July 2009 as a regional coach educator. On 8 January 2019 Cook became the manager of Gloucester City, replacing Chris Todd as manager. He was sacked from this role in November 2019.

Name The name Afritz is ultimately derived from the Slovene prepositional phrase za brdce 'behind the small hill'. The Slovene phrase fused to yield *Zabrdce, which was borrowed into Middle High German as *Zafriz (from which, in turn, Cobrc was borrowed back into Slovene). The initial z- was misunderstood as the Middle High German preposition ze 'at', yielding the modern German decomposition Afritz. Geography Lake Afritz It is located within the Gegend Valley surrounded by the Nock Mountains, the western part of the Gurktal Alps mountain range, on the southern shore of small Afritzer See (Lake Afritz). The municipal area comprises the cadastral communities of Afritz and Berg ob Afritz. History The remote valley was not settled until the High Middle Ages. Afritz itself was first mentioned in a 1408 deed, then an estate held by the Counts of Ortenburg.

Pouching systems are most commonly associated with colostomies, ileostomies, and urostomies. Pouching systems usually consist of a collection pouch, a barrier on the skin, and connect with the stoma itself, which is the part of the body that has been diverted to the skin. The system may be a one-piece system consisting only of a bag or, in some instances involve a device placed on the skin with a collection pouch that is attached mechanically or with an adhesive in an airtight seal, known as a two-piece system. The system used varies between individuals and is often based on the medical reason, personal preference and lifestyle.  Uses  Ostomy pouching systems collect waste that is output from a stoma. The pouching system allows the stoma to drain into a sealed collection pouch, while protecting the surrounding skin from contamination. They are used to maintain independence, so that a wearer can continue to lead an active lifestyle that can include all forms of sports and recreation.  Surface barriers  Urostoma and wafer/baseplate Ostomy barriers sit on the skin and separate the ostomy pouch from the internal conduit. They are not always present. These barriers, also called flanges, wafers, or baseplates are manufactured using pectin or similar organic material and are available in a wide variety of sizes to accommodate a person's particular anatomy. The internal opening must be the correct size to accommodate the individual's stoma while protecting the skin from contact with waste. The methods for sizing this opening vary depending on the type of wafer/baseplate; some pre- cut sizes are available, some users customize the opening using scissors. Manufacturers have recently introduced moldable wafers than can be shaped by hand without the need for scissors. Skin adhesion for modern wafers/baseplates/flanges are optimized on all the five parameters required in an adhesive: *absorption *tack and adhesion *flexibility *erosion resistance *ease of removal. In addition, barriers with adhesive border can provide additional security that the system stays in place. Using a barrier film spray before applying a new flange will improve adhesion, soothe irritated skin and protect the skin from irritation. A barrier may last between one to many days before it needs to be replaced; this is highly dependent on the individual's lifestyle, ostomy type, and anatomy.  Pouches  thumb200pxrightA typical ostomy pouch, in this case a closed-end or \\"disposable\\". Note the flange ring, which uses a \\"Tupperware\\" type of seal One-piece (open-end) bags The method of attachment to the barrier varies between manufactures and includes permanent (one-piece), press-on/click (\\"Tupperware\\" type), turning locking rings and \\"sticky\\" adhesive mounts. The two-piece arrangement allows pouches to be exchanged without removing the wafer; for example, some people prefer to temporarily switch to a \\"mini-pouch\\" for swimming, intimate and other short-term activities. Mini-pouches are suitable for minimum usage only. Pouches can be divided into two basic types: open-end (drainable) and closed- end (disposable). * Open-end pouches have a resealable end that can be opened to drain the contents of the pouch into a toilet. The end is sealed with either a Velcro-type closure or a simple clip. * Closed-end pouches can be removed and replaced with a new pouch once the bag is full or the pouch can be emptied and rinsed. The flange or wafer does not need to be replaced. The use of open-end vs. closed-end pouches is dependent on the frequency in which an individual needs to empty the contents, as well as economics. Gas is created during digestion, and an airtight pouch will collect this and inflate. To prevent this some pouches are available with special charcoal filtered vents that will allow the gas to escape, and prevent ballooning at night. Some odor can be expelled through the charcoal filter especially if sufficient deodorant is not used in the pouch. Pouch covers are helpful to disguise the plastic pouch when it is exposed when reaching or other physical activity. These are usually made of cloth and can be decorative or plain to blend in with clothing. Various sources stock sizes for most manufacturers pouches. There are flexible elastic pouch belts available for extreme physical activity but some of these require the pouch to be worn sideways so it does not fill properly and the tight fit causes pancaking of the effluent. Routine care People with colostomies must wear an ostomy pouching system to collect intestinal waste. Ordinarily the pouch must be emptied or changed a couple of times a day depending on the frequency of activity; in general the further from the anus (i.e., the further 'up' the intestinal tract) the ostomy is located the greater the output and more frequent the need to empty or change the pouch. People with colostomies who have ostomies of the sigmoid colon or descending colon may have the option of irrigation, which allows for the person to not wear a pouch, but rather just a gauze cap over the stoma, and to schedule irrigation for times that are convenient. To irrigate, a catheter is placed inside the stoma, and flushed with water, which allows the feces to come out of the body into an irrigation sleeve. Most colostomates irrigate once a day or every other day, though this depends on the person, their food intake, and their health. Impact Ostomy systems often take some time for a person to adjust to, including requiring time to learn how to use them and change the pouch, as well as psychologically adjust. The time taken to adjust may last for more than a year. Because of embarrassment or stigma associated with an ostomy system, a person who has an ostomy system can experience social isolation, depression, and change in sexual function as well as physical complications such as weight change.

It was available until 1963. The 600 was the first production car after the 1920s Clyno to have a continuously variable transmission (CVT) system - the innovative DAF Variomatic. The DAF Variomatic employs engine speed, via centrifugal weights, to shift the transmission and is enhanced by an engine manifold vacuum. It was the only car ever produced which went faster by the simple expedient of gently and gradually releasing the accelerator once top speed had been reached. This increased manifold vacuum which helped the variable pulleys shift to an even higher ratio so even though the engine RPM stays the same, the transmission increases the car's speed, in the case of the DAF 600, from to nearly given enough time and level road. The Variomatic also permitted increased engine braking by operating a switch on the dashboard which reversed the action of the vacuum on the pulley's diaphragm, seeking a lower ratio with increased manifold vacuum.

History Iceland was first settled in the 9th century by Norwegians who took captive Irish slaves. At this time, the same language was spoken in both Iceland and Norway. Vocabulary was largely Norse, and significant changes did not start to occur until the 13th and 14th centuries. Around this time, Norwegian declension and inflection became considerably simplified, whereas Icelandic‚Äôs did not. This difference can be seen today by comparing the two modern languages. The introduction of Christianity to Iceland in the 11th century brought with it a need to describe new religious concepts. The majority of new words were taken from other Scandinavian languages; kirkja (‚Äòchurch‚Äô) and biskup (‚Äòbishop‚Äô), for example. The relationship between the English and Icelandic languages is made evident by such importations. Other Germanic languages, Greek, and Latin also had a lesser influence. Numerous other languages have had their influence on Icelandic, French for example brought many words related to the court and knightship; words in the semantic field of trade and commerce have been borrowed from Low German because of trade connections. Many words were also brought in from Danish and German during the language reformation as the Bible was translated into Icelandic. Nowadays, it is common practice to coin new compound words from Icelandic derivatives. Modern neologisms hlutur (‚Äòa share‚Äô, ‚Äòa part‚Äô), br√©f (‚Äòa paper‚Äô, ‚Äòa letter‚Äô) and marka√∞ur (‚Äòa market‚Äô). It is often the case in Icelandic that words for new concepts or ideas are composites of other words, ve√∞urfr√¶√∞i (‚Äòmeteorology‚Äô), is derived from ve√∞ur (‚Äòweather‚Äô) and -fr√¶√∞i (‚Äòstudies‚Äô); or simply that old disused words are revived for new concepts. Like other Germanic languages, Icelandic words have a tendency to be compounded. This means that many small component words can be connected together to create a word with a new meaning. Take the example to right, hlutabr√©famarka√∞ur (‚Äòstock market‚Äô), which is made from the words hluti (‚Äòshare‚Äô), br√©f (‚Äòpaper‚Äô) and marka√∞ur (‚Äòmarket‚Äô). However, many neologisms are coined using only the stems of existing words complying with ancient practice. Two examples are √æyrla (Helicopter) from a verb meaning twirl and √æota (Jet) from the verb √æj√≥ta (rush). All in all the neologisms are coined by compounding or using the still active ablauts or umlauts. Both provide nearly inexhaustible sources. However, there are some notable exceptions to this rule. Kaffi, for example, is an Icelandicised version of the French caf√© or Italian caff√®, both meaning ‚Äòcoffee‚Äô; that is to say that it has been adapted to the rules of Icelandic orthography. There are numerous other examples, including banani (in that case there was a proposed alternative, bj√∫galdin, literally curved fruit, but that did not gain popularity). In situations like this, it may be awkward or impossible to create words for things that simply do not exist in Iceland by nature; therefore some form of a loanword may have to be used.

Biography Popper was born in Vienna and educated at the Academy of Commerce in Prague. As a little girl she had been to Montessori nursery school in Vienna. When the Germans came in on March the thirteen's 1938 she visited the gymnasium, and suddenly most of the children yelled 'Get out of here, you Jew.' In 1938, after Germany's annexation of Austria, when she was twelve years old, her family having Czech citizenship fled to the region formerly known as Czechoslovakia to escape the Nazis. Unfortunately this move provided only temporary safety. In spring 1939 her father left for Belgium and England. They were to meet again only at the end of the summer of '46. Four years later, in October 1942, she and her mother were sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp, near Prague, and later on also aunts and grandmother. While living there she has been put twice on the list for being transported to Auschwitz and both times she managed her name to be removed from that list. In January 1943 she asked the Jewish Elder to take her out of the transport.Quoting Erna Furman: \\"I think it was Edelstein. Anyway, I went and I will always remember that there were hundreds of people, yet nobody could get in. His door was guarded, and there was no way in. I said I had to see him and walked in. He said: 'What do you want?' I said: 'I am only 16 years old and still have to live. I am not ready to go in the transport and you have to take me out. (Page 61 of Biography.) Edelstein took her out of the transport because her mother had died that morning and she'd acquired different status by her mother's death. She came to Terezin from Prague in October 1942, and left in May 1945 (when the Russians took over Terezin), from age 16 to almost 19 years, and worked the entire time as 'Betreuerin' (caregiver) in a children's home, L 318. L 318 was one of the orphan houses in the ghetto.

In 1945 Anna Freud took a small group of Terezin children to England, they were taken care of under Anna Freud's supervision.

It is the story and analysis about an Auschwitz survivor, Elisabeth, who was brought as a small child to the special asylum in England supervised by Anna Freud and run by Alice Goldberger. (Page 107 of Biography, footnote 67.) At that time Anna Freud often called Erna Furman to ask her about things that came up with the children from camp, hoping that Erna could clarify them. Erna Furman's Terezin drawings were demonstrated at the Friedl Dicker-Brandeis's exhibit series in Japan in April‚ÄìOctober 2002. They were included in the exhibit and on display for the first time, the drawings and diaries of Erna Furman, \\"a survivor of Terezin and pupil of Friedl.\\"Exhibition Tokyo Fuji Art Museum April 2002 see section Memories of Friedl Her materials were taken in a special corner of the exhibition, called 'Erna's Room'.

She emigrated to the United States with the help of Anny Katan- RosenbergAnny Katan, M.D. 1898‚Äì1993 in the 1950s. She married Robert Furman,Robert A. Furman (1924‚Äì2002) had two daughters, Lydia and Tanya, and lived in Cleveland, Ohio with her husband. Both were prominent and respected psychoanalysts. Erna Furman specialized in children and how children process grief. Of particular importance was her evidence that children as young as three essentially process grief no differently from adults and her insistence that children not be misled or deceived when a parent dies. She wrote: > In all bereavement, it is extraordinarily important that all of the > realities of the death be known and appreciated by the survivor, > particularly the cause of the death. She practiced at the Hanna Perkins Center for Child Development and also saw patients in her Cleveland Heights home. She was a prolific writer; over the years she received extensive accolades for her contributions to psychoanalysis. She was made an honorary member of the American Psychoanalytic Association in 1999.

Also known as Pi Lo Chun, it is renowned for its delicate appearance, fruity taste, floral aroma, showy white hairs and early cropping. The name Biluochun literally means \\"green snail spring\\". It is called so because it is a green tea that is rolled into a tight spiral, resembling snail meat, and is cropped in early spring. Its original name is Xia Sha Ren Xiang (; \\"scary fragrance\\"). Legend tells of its discovery by a tea picker who ran out of space in her basket and put the tea between her breasts instead. The tea, warmed by her body heat, emitted a strong aroma that surprised the girl. According to the Qing Dynasty chronicle Ye Shi Da Guan, the Kangxi Emperor visited Lake Tai in the 38th year of his rule. At that time, because of its rich aroma, local people called it \\"Scary Fragrance\\". The Kangxi Emperor decided to give it a more elegant name, \\"Green Snail Spring\\". Chinese tea experts regard it very highly. Zhen Jun (1857 to 1918), author of tea encyclopedia Cha Shuo, ranked it first among Chinese green tea. Longjing tea came second, Liu An Gua Pian came third. It is so delicate and tender that one kilogram of Dong Ting Bi Luo Chun consists of 14,000 to 15,000 tea shoots. Today, Biluochun is cultivated in Dongting Mountains near Lake Tai in Suzhou, Jiangsu. Biluochun from Dong Shan (East Mountain) or Xi Shan (West Mountain) is considered the best. Biluochun is also grown in Zhejiang and Sichuan province. Their leaves are larger and less uniform (may contain yellow leaves). They taste more nutty than fruity and smooth.

Though traditionally conservative, the UAE is one of the most liberal countries in the Gulf, with other cultures and beliefs generally tolerated. Politically it remains authoritarian, however, relations with neighbouring Iran have been tense because of an ongoing territorial dispute over Gulf islands. The UAE was one of only three countries to recognise Taliban rule in Afghanistan. Before oil was discovered in the 1950s the UAE's economy was dependent on fishing and a declining pearl industry. But since oil exports began in 1962, the country's society and economy have been transformed. The UAE has diversified and has become a regional trading and tourism hub. UAE firms have invested heavily abroad. Early history=7000 BCE ‚Äì 7th century Records of the area where the emirate and city of Dubai is situated are very rare for any period before the 18th century. During the expansion of the Sheikh Zayed Road between 1993 and 1998, remnants of a mangrove swamp were uncovered which were dated to approximately 7000 BCE. It is thought that by about 3000 BCE, the coastline had moved seaward sufficiently towards the present-day coastline and the area became covered in sand. As it became more inhabitable, nomadic cattle herders used the area to live and herd in. The date palm began to be grown locally in 2500 BCE, and was the first instance of the land being used for agricultural purposes. The herders worshipped the god Bajir and various evidence suggests links to the mysterious Magan civilisation, who it is thought controlled the copper trade of this part of the ancient world, and of which there are archaeological sites in Bahrain. For the next about 2000‚Äì2700 years there are no more details, probably because of the desertification, insignificance, and remoteness of the area, until the area came part of the \\"Maka\\" satrapy, the southernmost satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire, and followed by the Sassanian Empire, the last pre-Islamic Iranian Empire, several hundred years later in the 3rd century CE. Recent excavations of the Jumeirah area of Dubai have unearthed a 6th-century caravan station suggesting the area was sparsely inhabited during this period. 7th century‚Äì1800 Al Fahidi Fort in Dubai in the late 1950s, built in 1787. Al Fahidi Fort is the oldest existing building in Dubai. The Umayyads introduced Islam to the area in the 7th century and sparked the vitalization of the area, opening up trade routes supported by fishing and pearl diving to eastern regions such as modern-day Pakistan and India, with reports of ships travelling as far as China to trade. The earliest written mention of the area of Dubai was in 1095, by Ab≈´ 'Ubayd 'Abd AllƒÅh al-Bakrƒ´, in his Mojam Ma Ostojam men Asmae Al belaad wal Mawadhea, in which he describes many places of the world compiled from other accounts of them. It was not until 1799 that the town had its first record. However, the Venetian Gasparo Balbi, a renowned pearl merchant, mentioned \\"Dibai\\" in a list of places he noted for the exceptional quality of their pearls in the year 1590. 1800‚Äì1966 Juma Al Maktoum (left) and Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum Al Maktoum (right) of the Maktoum family 1800‚Äì1912 In the early 19th century, the Al Abu Falasa dynasty (part of the House of Al-Falasi) of the Bani Yas tribe established Dubai, which remained a dependent of Abu Dhabi until 1833. On 8 January 1820, the Sheikh of Dubai and other sheikhs in the region signed the \\"General Maritime Peace Treaty\\" with the British government, which aimed to end plundering and piracy in the region and was the first formal denunciation of the slave trade in Emirati history. However, in 1833 the Al Maktoum dynasty (also descendants of the House of Al-Falasi) of the Bani Yas tribe left the settlement of Abu Dhabi and took over Dubai from the Abu Falasa clan without resistance, led by Maktoum bin Butti, the founder of the present day al-Maktoum dynasty. In 1841 the town was hit by a devastating smallpox outbreak which forced many to relocate east to the town of Deira, Dubai. In 1853, in an attempt to further halt the endemic piracy, the British signed another truce, agreeing to stay out of administration of the region in return for a reduction in piracy. This also had the side effect of the area becoming known as the Trucial States. In 1894 a fire swept through Deira, burning down most of the homes; however, perfect geographical positioning and thriving business enabled the rebuilding of the city. The success of the area led Sheikh Maktoum to sign an exclusive business deal with the British in 1892, making Dubai a British protectorate, and in 1894 granted full tax exemption for all foreign traders. By 1903, the Sheikh had succeeded in convincing a major British steamship line to make Dubai a port of call. Merchants from Lingah looked across to the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf finally making their homes in Dubai. They continued to trade with Lingah, however, as do many of the dhows in Dubai Creek today, and they named their district Bastakiya, after the Bastak region in southern Persia. At this time, almost a quarter of the population was of non-Emirati origin. 1912‚Äì1944 After various rulers, Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum who became Ruler in 1912, was the first Ruler to rule for a substantial period of time and is regarded by many as one of the fathers of Dubai. The times of prosperity thanks to the pearl industry continued solidly through until the Great Depression of 1929. The emergence of artificial pearls had begun to hit the economy of Dubai, and coupled with the effects of the depression caused the Sheikh to explore other opportunities for expansion. In 1929, he was briefly deposed and succeeded by Sheikh Mani bin Rashid, a relative; however, three days later he was restored to the throne and ruled until his death. This resulted in the emergence of Dubai as the premier re- export business port, whereby goods are imported into a duty-free port and immediately exported to another market. Dubai has the main entrep√¥t in the Persian Gulf and the busiest trading port since 1900, with commerce being the main source of revenue for the emirate. The merchant class in Dubai played a key role in restructuring the economy and government decision-making in the pre-oil era of Dubai's development. Today merchants play a fundamental role in economic affairs and the political structure. In addition, again they have taken on roles as service suppliers, urban planners, culture mediators, and internationalists representing the region throughout the world.Martin Hvidt, \\"Public-Private Ties and Their Contribution to Development: The Case of Dubai,\\" Middle Eastern Studies 2007 43(4): 557-577 Dubai suffered economically after 1920 due to the collapse of the pearl industry, the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the loss of extensive trade networks during World War II. Until the surge of oil revenues in the late 1960s, political instability and merchant unrest existed and constituted an organized attempt to subvert British control and the ruling Al-Maktoum family. African slavery was practiced until the 1960s. The uprising of 1938 in Dubai was the culmination of a decade of grievances and minor rebellions against the autocratic rule of Shaykh Sa'id bin Maktum (ruled 1912-58). In the 1930s the Trucial Coast was characterized by great poverty resulting primarily from a decline in the pearl trade. Much of the initiative for reform sprang from an attempt to ameliorate economic conditions‚Äîthe leaders of the movement having previously been successful pearl merchants. The new government established in October 1938 lasted only a few months before Shaykh Sa'id with Bedouin support was able to overthrow it in March 1939. The collapse of the reform movement is attributable to the role played by British agents and the weakness of the political structure that was set up.Christopher M. Davidson, \\"Arab Nationalism and British Opposition in Dubai, 1920-66,\\" Middle Eastern Studies 2007 43(6): 879-892 1945‚Äì1958 A dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi regarding their border escalated into armed conflict between the two states, with Dubai attacking a number of Abu Dhabi towns in the country's interior. Arbitration by the British in 1949 resulted in the creation of a buffer frontier running south eastwards from the coast at Ras Hasian. A formal compromise was not reached until 1979, eight years after the creation of the UAE. 1958‚Äì1966 In 1958, upon the death of Saeed bin Maktoum Al Maktoum, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum became Ruler. Rashid al Maktoum is widely regarded as the driving force behind the expansion of Dubai, causing its massive expansion, with the aid of the discovery of oil. He embarked on a dredging of Dubai Creek in 1963, as the creek was too small for modern ships to dock there, which caused severe negative economic effects. He borrowed huge amounts of money to pull off the dredging, which was highly risky as the money necessary to complete it was far higher than Dubai's annual income. The dredging was a success, which enabled vessels of any size to dock at the port. This caused the gold re-export market to take off, and ensuring Rashid was able to begin the building of vital infrastructure in partnership with the British. Since the beginning, Dubai was constantly at odds with Abu Dhabi. In 1947, a border dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi on their northern border erupted into war between the two states and forced the involvement of the British and the subsequent creation of a buffer zone which resulted in a temporary ceasefire. However, border disputes between the emirates continued even after the formation of the UAE and it was only in 1979 that a formal compromise was reached that ended hostilities between the two states, by allowing Abu Dhabi the control of the rest of the UAE, while leaving Dubai to rule many of its own affairs, especially when related to trade. 1966‚Äìpresent day=Discovery of oil The major turning point in the history and fortunes of Dubai was the discovery of oil in 1966. Coupled with the joining of the newly independent country of Qatar and Dubai to create a new currency, the Riyal, after the devaluation of the Persian Gulf rupee which had been issued by the Government of India, it enabled Dubai to rapidly expand and grow. Once the first shipment of oil was made in 1969, the future of Dubai as an autonomous state was secured, and its ability to dictate policy in later years to the UAE was cemented. Formation of the UAE Britain left the Persian Gulf in the early part of 1971, having announced their intentions in 1968, causing Dubai and Abu-Dhabi, in conjunction with five other emirates to form the United Arab Emirates. Dubai and Abu-Dhabi ensured in the negotiations that between them they could control the country effectively, enabling even greater expansion as seen today. In 1973, Dubai joined the other emirates, in introducing the UAE dirham, the uniform currency of the UAE. Dubai and Abu Dhabi between them now hold the majority of control in the UAE, which was part of their conditions for joining. To enable this, Abu Dhabi and Dubai are the only emirates who have veto power over matters of national importance, whereas the other emirates only have a vote on such matters. In addition to this, Dubai is represented by eight members on the Federal National Council, of whom there are forty in total. Dubai and Ras al Khaimah are the only two states who retain their own judicial courts, whilst the others are part of the federal justice system of the UAE. The Jebel Ali Free Zone was introduced in 1979, providing companies with unrestricted import of labour and export of capital, which helped to jumpstart the influx of global companies seen today. 1990 - present day The current Emir, Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum The death of Sheikh Rashid al-Maktoum resulted in the accession of Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum to the throne. The Persian Gulf War of 1990, in which Dubai as part of the UAE provided military aid to the coalition, unsettled the economy; however, in the mid-1990s this stabilised and many foreign trading communities moved their businesses to Dubai. Dubai continued to foster political alignment with the western world and during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, they provided refueling bases to allied forces in the Jebel Ali Free Zone as they did during the Persian Gulf War. Global increases in oil prices allowed Dubai to focus on rapid development of key infrastructure. The success of the Jebel Ali free zone caused the development of clusters of new free zones, including Dubai Internet City, an internet technology area with ownership and tax related benefits, Dubai Media City, a tax-free zone to increase Dubai's presence in the worldwide media, and Dubai Maritime City, which will have many facilities, including waterfronts and harbours. In the past decades, Dubai has become known for its successful building projects, including the Burj Al Arab, the world's tallest freestanding hotel, The Palm Islands, a construction of three artificial islands in the shape of the date palm, on which residential and commercial property will be built and The World Islands, a massive man-made archipelago of 300 islands in the shape of the world, and Burj Khalifa, which is the world's tallest man-made structure. In 2006, upon the death of Sheikh Maktoum al-Maktoum, his brother, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum became Emir, having been de facto ruler for a decade and credited with helping to force Dubai's rapid expansion. The economic depression has hit Dubai extremely hard, due to its dependence on tourism and building which has led to many newspaper reports of construction slowing and in some cases stopping altogether. In an effort to combat the recession, Dubai has announced various tax cutting measures to incentivise businesses in the region. Dubai has also been in the news for its attitudes towards adultery, which are seen as harsh in the Western world, with some cases forcing the intervention of other governments on behalf of their citizens. Future Despite the international turmoil over the cost of oil, Dubai is already considered to be the Hong Kong of the Middle East. When the world's oil supply runs out, Dubai would survive in a new oil-free world unlike Riyadh. Commercial activity in the Dubai region would simply grow instead of wither because Dubai was a major trading center centuries before oil was known to even exist. The emirate's trade access with Iran is similar to Hong Kong's trade with the People's Republic of China due to Iran being ostracized by the majority of the Western world. Dubai skyline, 2010 During the 21st century, Dubai may have to implement policies that move away from globalization and toward localization to conserve their energy resources, provide local jobs to citizens of the United Arab Emirates instead of foreign citizens, and maintain their local decision-making authority. Zoning policies would be adjusted by Dubai's municipal government to promote resource conservation and eliminate sprawl.How to talk about the end of growth: Interview with Richard Heinberg While Dubai has opened its doors to tourists by permitting non-Muslims to drink alcoholic beverages, a lot of these services are being used by the foreign-born workers who take jobs away from legal residents of the UAE.After the Oil: The Future of the Middle East at Sigma Scan The last remaining oil deposits in the United Arab Emirates will run out at the end of 2029. Even when there is no more oil in the UAE, their federal government will make 90% of the income that they earned in 2013 by virtue of milking the tourism industry to the fullest. As of February 2006, Dubai (along with the rest of the United Arab Emirates) only has a reserve supply of 44 billion barrels of crude petroleum. If used properly and in conjunction with alternate fuels, the reserve fuels that will keep economy activity afloat in Dubai will last until the end of the 21st century. Disputes In addition to the long running dispute between Abu-Dhabi and Dubai, Dubai was also involved in a dispute with Sharjah with regards to their legal boundaries. Before the British left, there were no exact boundaries defined between the Trucial States; however, with the discovery of oil needing boundaries to be decided for concession reasons, Britain was required to define the boundaries. After Julian Walker, a British official (later the British political agent) had surveyed the area, Mr. Tripp, the British political agent, made declarations between 1956 and 1957 defining the boundaries. Although the rulers of both Dubai and Sharjah had agreed in 1954 to accept the rulings made, Dubai's ruler declined to accept the decision. Even after the formation of the UAE, neither state had agreed on the boundaries and hence, on 30 November 1976 they signed an arbitration compromise under the auspices of the Supreme Council of the Federation. Eventually, the Supreme Council ruled that the decisions were administrative, binding decisions as opposed to arbitral awards, the Tripp boundaries were defined as the border.  Rulers of Dubai  A simplified family tree of the al-Maktoum family The following is a list of rulers of Dubai, Al-Maktoum dynasty, going back at least to 1833. *... - 9 June 1833 Sheikh \`Ubayd ibn Said *9 June 1833 - 1852 Sheikh Maktoum I bin Bati ibn Suhayl (d. 1852) *1852 - 1859 Sheikh Said I ibn Bati (d. 1859) *1859 - 22 November 1886 Sheikh Hushur ibn Maktoum (d. 1886) *22 November 1886 - 7 April 1894 Sheikh Rashid I bin Maktoum (d. 1894) *7 April 1894 - 16 February 1906 Sheikh Maktoum II bin Hushur (b. 18.. - d. 1906) *16 February 1906 - November 1912 Sheikh Bati bin Suhayl (b. 1851 - d. 1912) *November 1912 - 15 April 1929 Sheikh Saeed II bin Maktum (1st time) (b. 1878 - d. 1958) *15 April 1929 - 18 April 1929 Sheikh Mani bin Rashid *18 April 1929 - September 1958 Sheikh Saeed II bin Maktum (2nd time) *September 1958 - 7 October 1990 Sheikh Rashid II ibn Said Al Maktoum (b. 1912 - d. 1990) *7 October 1990 ‚Äì 4 January 2006 Sheikh Maktoum III bin Rashid Al Maktoum (b. 1943 - d. 2006) *4 January 2006‚ÄìPresent Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (b. 1949) The current ruler of Dubai is Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Like his predecessor, Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, he is also the Vice President and the Prime Minister of the UAE. Having attended school in the United Kingdom, he became part of the everyday running of the country. He has two wives, Sheikha Hind bint Maktoum bin Juma Al Maktoum and Princess Haya bint Al Hussein, the daughter of the King of Jordan. He is widely known for being involved with horse-racing and his charitable donations, along with his credit for advancing Dubai's infrastructure and economy.

Portrayed by Diahann Carroll from 1984 to 1987, the character is the surprise half-sister of millionaire Blake Carrington (John Forsythe). Dominique was written out of the series at the end of its seventh season, and did not return for the 1991 miniseries Dynasty: The Reunion. In The CW's Dynasty reboot, Dominique is played by Michael Michele and is Jeff and Monica Colby‚Äôs mother. Original series=Development With Dynasty in its fourth season, Diahann Carroll saw the success of prime time soap operas, and noted that while they had covered many issues like rape and homosexuality, they had yet to tackle racial integration. She said at the time, \\"I want to be the first black bitch on television.\\" Carroll had her manager reach out to Dynasty producer Aaron Spelling, but there had been no response before she and Spelling ran into each other soon after. Barbra Streisand had asked Carroll to sing a song from Yentl at the Golden Globes ceremony, and afterwards Carroll and Spelling found themselves at the same nightclub. He said, \\"When Diahann came in, [Dynasty co- creator] Esther Shapiro and I looked at her, looked at each other and said, 'My God, she is Dynasty.'\\" Carroll told Shapiro that night, \\"If it's not me let it be someone, because it's time.\\" Spelling said, \\"We virtually closed the deal that night while having a drink at the bar.\\" Dominique was introduced as a wealthy mystery woman who believed herself to be a Carrington, and in season five she is revealed to be Blake's half-sister. Joining Dynasty made Carroll the only black actress with a continuing role on a nighttime serial at that time, and Dominique the first prominently-featured African-American character on a prime time soap opera. Carroll said, \\"I certainly wasn't researching the number of blacks on TV, but how could you fail to see they're not there?\\" Appearing in the final two episodes of the fourth season, Carroll's estimated salary was $35,000 an episode, and she was contracted for at least 17 of season five's 29 shows. Shapiro said, \\"We wanted a part where a black could be on the same social and economic level as the other characters. The one thing we wouldn't do is put on a black woman as a victim.\\" She added, \\"Our intention is to play the characters in 1984 with an emphasis on character, not color.\\" From the beginning, Dominique was intended as a foil for Alexis Colby, the villainess played by Joan Collins. Shapiro said, \\"Dominique is not out to outbitch Alexis per se.\\" Collins said, \\"I think it is wonderful to have another fabulous 'over 40' in prime time. We have had a couple of bitch-to- bitch scenes which have been very good. And of course, no one knows better than I that in playing a bitch you don't have to be one.\\" Carroll commented, \\"Joan and I are close enough in age and experience to realize that this is great for all of us. In the final analysis we will be good for each other.\\" Willis Edwards, president of the Beverly Hills/Hollywood chapter of the NAACP, said of Carroll's casting, \\"This is a major thing as far as we're concerned. We've been fighting for something like this for years.\\" Linda Evans, who played Krystle Carrington, said at the time, \\"I don't think the impact of her coming on the show will affect only blacks. I think it will be great for all the people who see her.\\" Characterization While pursuing a role on one of the nighttime soaps, Carroll said \\"I want to be wealthy and ruthless\\". She said in 2011 that Dynasty producer Elaine Rich \\"liked the idea of [Dominique] being a bitch\\", and Carroll said to her, \\"I think the most important thing for us to remember is write for a white male, and you'll have it. We'll have the character. Don't try to write for what you think I am, write for a white man who wants to be wealthy and powerful. And that's the way we found Dominique Deveraux.\\" In a 1984 interview, Carroll said \\"I've never played a role quite this unlikeable. And I like that. I like that very much because I think very often, particularly minorities, it's almost required of them that they are nice people, and I don't want to play a nice person.\\" Appearances Carroll originated the role of singer/businesswoman Dominique Deveraux in the 1984 episode \\"New Lady in Town\\". She appeared in 71 episodes of Dynasty, and seven episodes of The Colbys. The character last appeared in the 1987 Dynasty season seven finale \\"Shadow Play\\". To circumvent any chance the storyline would leak to the press, a number of scenes were filmed to introduce Dominique, including alternative lines revealing that she was the mother of Kirby Anders (Kathleen Beller) or the ex-wife of Alexis' former husband, Cecil Colby (Lloyd Bochner). Carroll was repeatedly featured rehearsing and/or performing songs in several episodes of both series. StorylinesSeason four= Successful and wealthy chanteuse Dominique Deveraux arrives in Denver in \\"New Lady in Town\\" (1984) with a flourish, asking Fallon Carrington Colby (Pamela Sue Martin) questions about her mother, Alexis Colby (Joan Collins). In the next episode, the fourth season finale, Dominique wonders, \\"Won't it just knock their socks off when they find out I'm a Carrington?\\" =Season five= Dominique's husband Brady Lloyd (Billy Dee Williams) arrives in Denver in the September 26, 1984 season premiere episode, \\"Disappearance.\\" He asks why Dominique is performing at La Mirage. Brady and Dominique fight when she will not tell him why she is choosing to remain in Denver. Dominique's hostility toward oil tycoon Blake Carrington (John Forsythe) is noticed by Blake's wife Krystle (Linda Evans). Following Fallon's memorial service in \\"The Rescue\\", Dominique makes the shocking claim that she is the daughter of Blake's father Tom Carrington and his longtime mistress, Laura Matthews, and offers proof (found in a letter in an old trunk left in the care of Laura's sister Bessie), therefore making her Blake's half-sister. A financially strapped Blake makes a business deal with the very wealthy Dominique: Forty percent of Denver-Carrington in exchange for $70 million. This subsequently makes Dominique an enemy of Alexis, who has been scheming to destroy her ex-husband Blake. When Brady learns the truth, he is furious that Dominique didn't confide in him earlier. As Blake's business partner, Dominique travels to Istanbul to meet with the shady Rashid Ahmed in order to help Blake obtain a confession from him. Despite this assistance, in episode 100, Blake tells Dominique that Tom denies that he is her father. Furious, Dominique instigates a lawsuit against Blake for misappropriation of company funds after Blake uses some of the money she invested in Denver-Carrington to prevent losing his mansion. However, episode 102, \\"The Will\\", Dominique and Blake visit their father Tom on his deathbed in Sumatra; Alexis, a favorite of Tom's, follows them. Tom meets his illegitimate daughter Dominique for the first time, and she convinces him to accept her. Tom dies, but not before including Dominique in his will, as well as making her the executor, which further infuriates Alexis (who is also a beneficiary). In episode 103, \\"The Treasure\\", Blake and Dominique discuss the matter between them and Blake finally acknowledges her as his half-sister. Dominique, in a show of gratitude, tells Blake that she has dropped her lawsuit against him. Later on, Blake summons Alexis to his office and tells her that if she persists in trying to break Tom's will, he will put his support firmly behind Dominique. Furthermore, he reiterates the fact that she is now family and that he will fight to the death for her. Alexis concedes to Blake's demands, but tells him she'll find a way to destroy Dominique regardless. Later that evening at the Carrington mansion, Blake holds a dinner gathering to formally welcome Dominique into the family. Adam goes out of his way to welcome her as well and Dominique is overcome with emotion. Later on, Amanda tells her mother Alexis about the gathering and that she is proud to have Dominique as her new aunt, much to Alexis' annoyance. Alexis then places a call to one of her associates and orders him to find out everything he can about Dominique. In episode 108, Dominique learns that Brady has filed for divorce and that Alexis is attempting to take over her company, Deveraux Group, Inc., after which she collapses. At the hospital Dominique learns that she needs heart surgery. She pulls through her illness and becomes closer to Blake and Krystle. Although the divorce goes through, Brady refuses to sell his shares in Deveraux Group, Inc. to Alexis, foiling the takeover. Noticing that famed photojournalist Lady Ashley Mitchell appears to have designs on Blake, she warns Ashley to keep away and advises Krystle to watch out. Dominique is among the family guests invited to Moldavia to celebrate the wedding of her niece, Amanda, to Prince Michael, where a military coup takes place and insurgents take over the chapel and gun down the entire wedding party. =Season six (Dynasty) / Season one (The Colbys)= Dominique survives the wedding massacre, and rejects an offer by the rebel leader to remain in Moldavia to \\"entertain the troops and improve morale\\". Back in Denver, Dominique works with Blake on a pipeline deal with Jason Colby (Charlton Heston). She encounters Jonathan Lake (Calvin Lockhart), a state department employee, who reminds Dominique that they met years ago in Paris. Romance seems to be blossoming between the pair, but then a man from her past returns: Garrett Boydston (Ken Howard), Jason Colby's lawyer. Garrett tries to rekindle their romance, but Dominique is resistant. Years earlier, Dominique and Garrett had an affair. At the time, Garrett claimed that he was married and refused to leave his wife. Dominique is torn between the two men until she learns that Jonathan has aligned himself with Bart Fallmont, a politician who is fighting the pipeline project. Dominique travels frequently to Los Angeles, and hires Monica Colby (Tracy Scoggins) to help run her L.A.-based record company. While there, she continues to see Garrett. He cannot understand her reluctance to resume their relationship. In episode 134, Dominique's daughter, Jackie (Troy Beyer) visits her mother and asks to remain in Denver instead of returning to finishing school in Lausanne, Switzerland. In episode 136, Garrett meets Jackie and is immediately convinced that he is her father. Garrett presses Dominique but she continues to deny that he is Jackie's father. Jackie, who would like to see her mother married and happy, also wonders about the true nature of their relationship. In episode 143, Jackie runs away when she learns that her father is listed as \\"unknown\\" on her birth certificate. Alexis encounters Jackie and manipulates the girl into telling her troubles. Dominique finally admits to Garrett that he is indeed Jackie's father. Jackie returns home in episode 145 and finally learns that Garrett is her father. In episode 146, Dominique and Garrett decide to marry. In the season finale, at their engagement party Alexis reveals that Garrett was never married before. He lied in order to avoid a long-term relationship. Dominique slaps Alexis and orders her to leave. She confronts Garrett with the story who admits that he lied so many years ago. Stunned, Dominique breaks off the engagement. Her guests continue to celebrate, unaware that the wedding is cancelled ‚Äî or that a fire is raging in other parts of the hotel. =Season seven (Dynasty) / Season two (The Colbys)= During the fire, Dominique panics when she cannot find Jackie. Dex Dexter manages to rescue Jackie, but she is badly burned. Jackie provides eye witness testimony to the cause of the fire, before leaving Denver for state-of-the-art burn treatment. During this time, Dominique helps Blake to fight Alexis, who has taken over Blake's company with the assistance of their estranged brother, Ben. She also attempts to revive her singing career. When a bad review appears in Alexis's newspaper, Dominique goes to confront her in episode 160 and a cat fight ensues. In episode 154, Dominique meets geologist Nick Kimball, who romantically pursues her. Dominique resists him at first, but by episode 158 she gives in to his advances and they share a passionate night together. In episode 163, Nick saves Dominique from two thugs who were sent by businessman Gary Tilden to \\"rough her up\\" after she rejected a business deal from Tilden. But Dominique is still restrained about their relationship ‚Äì and draws closer to Alexis's ex-husband Dex. Nick returns in episode 173 to whisk Dominique off for a romantic weekend in San Francisco, where he proposes. While Dominique contemplates marrying Nick, Jackie returns to Denver to tell her mother that Garrett is still in love with her. In episode 175, Jackie asks Nick to break it off with Dominique. When Dominique states that she will not get back together with Garrett, a defeated Jackie leaves Denver again. In episode 176, the season finale, Dominique and Nick attend the wedding of her nephew, Adam. After the ceremony, Dominique accepts his proposal and the two leave Denver. =Season nine= Though not physically seen after season seven, Dominique (having revived her singing career touring Europe) is mentioned in season nine as Blake investigates the murder of Roger Grimes. Blake visits Dominique's uncle Charles Matthews, brother to her mother Laura and Aunt Bessie. Charles and his wife Jane later provide Blake with some of his father's belongings, left with them by Laura and then Bessie for safekeeping. Reboot=Development A Dynasty reboot premiered on The CW on October 11, 2017. A May 2018 press release teased that the show would introduce Blake's half- sister Dominique Deveraux, Jeff and Monica Colby's mother, in season two. Executive producer Sallie Patrick said of introducing Dominique: On March 22, 2019, it was announced that Michael Michele had been cast to play Dominique for later in the second season of Dynasty. On October 11, 2019, it was confirmed that Michele had been promoted to series regular for the third season. This came after the fact that the actress had previously revealed her promotion via an Instagram comment back in July. Ahead of the third season's premiere, executive producer Josh Reims stated that Dominique would replace Alexis Carrington (previously played by Nicollette Sheridan, who had not yet been recast) as the show's new primary troublemaker, playing both sides in the Colby and Carringtons‚Äô war. Reims also confirmed that Dominique's secret family \\"[would] show up at some point.\\" StorylinesSeason one= In the 2018 season one episode \\"Trashy Little Tramp\\", Jeff and Monica's grandmother confesses that their mother, Millie, was fathered by Thomas Carrington, making her Blake's sister. =Season two= Jeff leaves a message for his mother in the season two episode \\"A Champagne Mood\\", and invites her to Atlanta for a reunion in \\"The Sight of You\\". Monica, still furious over their mother's abandonment, calls Dominique and threatens a confrontation if she gets on the plane Jeff sent. Jeff is dejected when their mother does not come, or even call. In \\"New Lady in Town\\", Dominique reappears as Jeff recovers at home. She and Monica clash over Dominique's abandonment, and though Dominique is apologetic, she asserts that Jeff and Monica were better off being raised by their grandmother. Dominique confesses that she has been lying about having a successful career, and Jeff writes his mother a check for $1 million as a trap to see if she only came back for money. Jeff and Monica catch Dominique trying to leave, but she has thrown the check in the trash. Dominique takes a secret phone call, revealing that she has been manipulating Jeff and Monica, and that she has other children in New York. In \\"Thicker Than Money\\", Dominique visits Blake, who has been paying her for years to keep secret the fact that she is his half-sister. The payments have recently stopped, and Dominique wants what she is owed. Blake says she can have her money when she gets Jeff off his back. Jeff figures out that Adam poisoned him, and enlists Dominique to help destroy Blake and Adam. In \\"Deception, Jealousy, and Lies\\" Jeff and Dominique stage a crime scene with Jeff's blood and Adam Carrington's cufflink to make it look like Adam murdered Jeff, who leaves the country. Dominique, however, removes the cufflink and calls Blake to confirm that his payments to her will resume now that Jeff is out of the way. =Season three= In \\"Guilt Trip to Alaska\\", Dominique uses the press surrounding Jeff's disappearance and the Carrington Foundation Fundraiser as her reintroduction to Atlanta society. Dominique makes an enemy out of Blake's fianc√©e Cristal, sending a journalist to investigate the Flores family as part of her plan to take control of the Carringtons' dynasty. \\"Caution Never Won a War\\" sees a power struggle between Dominique and Cristal, following Blake's arrest for murder, and Dominique's desire for fame and attention is put on hold when Cristal blackmails her into cancelling an interview, threatening to cut off Blake's monthly payments. In \\"Wild Ghost Chase\\", Monica grows impatient with the pacing of Jeff's investigation and both she and a recently returned Jeff discover Dominique sabotaged their plan for Blake. Feeling betrayed, Jeff kicks Dominique out of his home. Dominique works to earn Jeff and Monica's forgiveness in \\"Something Desperate\\", agreeing to help sabotage Blake's winery, his last remaining business since being imprisoned. Though she initially spoils the wine, she later takes credit for a gas explosion that blinds Adam. In \\"Mother? I'm at La Mirage\\", Dominique's stepdaughter Vanessa arrives in Atlanta to the former's dismay, not ready to include Vanessa in her master plan. Dominique uses the grand re-opening of the hotel La Mirage as a time to bond with Jeff as well as get Vanessa recognition as a performer. Dominique and Vanessa drug the artist Ashanti, who was scheduled to perform, and Vanessa sings in her place. Jeff also confesses his terminal illness to Dominique. In \\"A Used Up Memory\\", Dominique works on getting Vanessa signed to Fallon and Monica's record label while Vanessa develops a relationship with Michael Culhane. However, Vanessa accidentally lets it slip that Dominique is also her stepmother. Michael confronts Dominique in \\"Shoot from the Hip\\", demanding she tell Jeff and Monica the truth about Vanessa, but Dominique blackmails Michael into silence after making a deal with Blake to stop the monthly payments in exchange for information. However, Vanessa goes against Dominique's wishes and tells Monica the truth at Thanksgiving dinner. In \\"The Sensational Blake Carrington Trial\\", Dominique works to make amends with her children yet again, but while Jeff has made his peace with Dominique's continuous antics, Monica decides to take an indefinite trip to New York. She invites Vanessa to go with her, who accepts the offer, leaving their mother alone. Dominique is stunned to see Alexis Carrington return to testify at Blake's trial, now married to Jeff. Dominique warns Jeff against Alexis in \\"The Caviar, I Trust, Is Not Burned\\", but Jeff swears allegiance to his new wife. Dominique revels in Alexis' failure to get Blake convicted of murder and exaggerates a fall and neck injury when Alexis pushes her. She later announces she's going back to New York for the time being. Dominique returns to Atlanta in \\"Battle Lines\\", wanting to stay with Jeff, who turns her away. She runs into Michael at a bar where she gets him drunk and the two have sex. However, Michael later reveals that Vanessa is back in town and the two are back together, begging Dominique to keep their one night stand a secret. Dominique, meanwhile, assists Blake in breaking into Jeff's office in order to get information on the re-sale of Carrington Atlantic, demanding something big in return. Once Blake gets what he wants, Dominique moves into Carrington manor. In \\"You See Most Things in Terms of Black & White\\", Blake and Cristal are dismayed with having to live with Dominique for the next year, who later pitches a reality show - House of Deveraux - about herself and Vanessa set in the manor. The producer is more interested in the immediate Carringtons, so Dominique works to put together a sizzle reel with Cristal, leading to her discovery of Cristal potentially having an affair. Dominique confronts Cristal in \\"That Wicked Stepmother\\", agreeing to keep quiet in exchange for Vanessa also getting to live in the manor. Dominique closes the deal on the reality show by leaking a recording of her and Michael having sex, resulting in a dramatic confrontation between her and Vanessa at Fallon and Liam's engagement party. In \\"Up a Tree\\", Dominique works with Vanessa to get Michael to join House of Deveraux. He agrees to shoot a few scenes as a peace offering to Vanessa, but once officially getting him on board, the two women celebrate Vanessa manipulating him. The manipulation continues in \\"She Cancelled...\\" when Dominique insists on a huge birthday celebration for Michael at La Mirage. Anders later obtains video evidence of Dominique and Vanessa conspiring in private, which he shows to Michael. In \\"Robin Hood Rescues\\", Dominique, Vanessa, and Michael get together to discuss deals for a second season of House of Deveraux, but when Dominique receives a better offer elsewhere, she provides a long list of demands for the network. House of Deveraux is cancelled, and Dominique and Vanessa come to learn that Michael played them and that there was never a better offer. With the reality show cancelled, Vanessa fires Dominique as her manager, leaving her with nothing.

Portrayed by Stephanie Beacham, the character was introduced on Dynasty in the November 1985 two-part episode \\"The Titans\\" as the socialite wife of wealthy California CEO Jason Colby (Charlton Heston). Beacham was subsequently a series regular on The Colbys for two seasons from 1985 to 1987. She reappeared as Sable on Dynasty for its ninth and final season from 1988 to 1989. Development and casting In March 1985, ABC announced that its rumored Dynasty spin-off, The Colbys, had been greenlighted, to debut the following season. Charlton Heston was cast as patriarch Jason Colby in July 1985, and it was reported that The Colbys versions of Dynasty rivals Krystle Carrington (Linda Evans) and Alexis Colby (Joan Collins) would be named Anthea (later changed to Francesca) and Sable. Faye Dunaway, Angie Dickinson, Elizabeth Ashley, and Diana Rigg all turned down the role of Jason's wife Sable. In August 1985, producers cast British actress Stephanie Beacham, \\"a household name\\" in the UK who had starred in the title role of the ITV drama Connie. On vacation after playing a ruthless businesswoman on Connie, Beacham almost passed on the request that she return to London to screen test for The Colbys. She was compelled to return when her housesitter locked the keys in her home. Beacham tested on a Friday, was flown to Los Angeles a week later, and was in wardrobe the next day. She noted of her audition, \\"I said whatever rubbish I could remember and camped it up\\". Beacham later explained that her main reason for doing The Colbys was her pay, which was an estimated $20,000 per episode. Beacham said that she and Heston were \\"a very lovely team\\", and that \\"What was really flattering actually was that the crew always used to gather around to watch the first run-through of our scenes, not just because they had to.\\" Beacham is completely deaf in her right ear and has only 70 percent hearing in her left, and she compensates by positioning herself to the right of other actors in as many scenes as possible. Appearances Beacham debuted as Sable in the Dynasty episodes \\"The Titans: Part 1\\" and \\"The Titans: Part 2\\", which aired back-to-back on November 13, 1985. She subsequently appeared as a series regular on The Colbys, which ran for two seasons from November 20, 1985 to March 26, 1987. Beacham later played Sable in the ninth and final season of Dynasty from 1988 to 1989. Characterization Jasper Rees of The Telegraph wrote in 2016 that \\"Stephanie Beacham will forever be known as blow-dried, shoulder-padded vamp Sable Colby\\". Barbara Holsopple of The Pittsburgh Press called Sable \\"scheming\\" and \\"smarmy\\", noting that Jason's wife is ruffled by his sister Constance Colby's (Barbara Stanwyck) bestowal of her company shares on her nephew Jeff (John James) rather than to Jason and Sable's three children. David Wallace of People described Sable as \\"wily\\", and recounted how Sable deals with Constance by first trying to have her declared incompetent and then by sabotaging her horse's saddle. Dynasty co-creator Esther Shapiro said of Beacham, \\"We loved her patrician quality. Despite Sable's seamy side, you understand why a major tycoon would stay married to her.\\" Wallace dubbed Beacham \\"the show's real fire\\", and wrote that she \\"might just be the one to show Joan Collins the real meaning of she-deviltry.\\" In February 1986, Beacham said that a confrontation between Sable and her cousin Alexis (Collins) might be \\"jolly good fun.\\" Beacham commented in 2012 that she and Collins \\"felt we represented the Eighties.\\" Beacham said of Sable, \\"When she gets cross, frightful things can happen...I've allowed Sable to get more and more neurotic...she's such a terror.\\" Beacham agreed it could be a challenge playing someone with so much emotion, but called Sable \\"a nearly three-dimensional human being\\". Storylines=Dynasty season six The Colbys of Los Angeles come to Denver to celebrate a new business venture with oil tycoon Blake Carrington (John Forsythe) in the 1985 Dynasty episodes \\"The Titans: Parts 1 and 2\\". Sable is the wife of mogul Jason Colby, and the mother of his three children Miles (Maxwell Caulfield), Monica (Tracy Scoggins), and Bliss (Claire Yarlett). The Colbys season one In the series premiere, \\"The Celebration\\", the Colbys return to Los Angeles and Sable is upset that Jason's sister Constance has given her shares to her nephew Jeff rather than Sable and Jason's three children. A dismissive Jason tells Sable to stay out of it, but she makes a failed attempt to convince Constance that she has made a mistake. Sable is getting worried that no one has heard from Miles, and also tells Monica that it is unlikely Jason will ever treat her like he would a man. In \\"Conspiracy of Silence\\", the Colbys are surprised when Miles comes home married to Randall, who they now know is an amnesiac Fallon Carrington (Emma Samms). Sable is delighted that her son has married an heiress. She is reunited with her estranged sister Francesca (Katharine Ross), Jeff's mother with Jason's deceased brother Philip, but makes it clear she hopes Frankie will not stay in town long. Hoping to tie Fallon to Miles, Sable suggests to Fallon that she have a baby as soon as possible in \\"Moment of Truth\\". Sable accuses Frankie of conspiring with Constance to benefit Jeff. Frankie intends to leave town, but is convinced to stay by Jason, with whom she had an affair many years ago. Sable comes across Jason's medical report and is shocked to learn that he is dying, unaware that his doctor has told him the diagnosis was a mistake. Sable apologizes to Frankie in \\"Family Album\\", hoping she will talk Constance about the shares she gave Jeff. Sable is told that the only way to reverse Constance's decision is to have her declared incompetent. When Constance dismisses Sable a final time, Sable goes to Jason with false concern about Constance's mental state. Sable is sure that Zach's interest in her is only a means to get to Jason, but she begins to soften to him. Sable continues her plan to make Constance appear senile in \\"Shadow of the Past\\". Sable loosens Constance's saddle, but is horrified when Frankie takes the horse and is almost injured. Constance, however, starts doubting herself. In \\"A House Divided\\", Jason confides in Frankie that Sable has become very greedy and selfish, but Frankie encourages him to work on his marriage. Sable learns of Constance's secret boyfriend Hutch Corrigan (Joseph Campanella), and mistakenly comes to believe that he is a con man extorting money from her. Zach continues to pursue Sable, but she keeps him at arm's length. Sable tells a horrified Jason that she has taken the first steps to have Constance declared mentally incompetent. Sable tries to justify her actions to Jason in \\"The Reunion\\", but he does not like how she has changed and vows to fight her on Constance's behalf. Fallon has regained her memory, and Sable is unhappy when Miles offers to annul their marriage. Sable tells Constance that she can avoid a trial by simply undoing her gift to Jeff, but Constance refuses. Sable asks Frankie to take Jeff and to leave town so that she can save Miles's marriage and her own. Learning of Sable's lawsuit, Jeff goes to Constance and offers to return the shares in \\"Fallen Idol\\", but she refuses. Sable goes to Zach's apartment to view a painting and resists his advances. Sable apologizes to Frankie for her hostility, and though Jason is willing to give his marriage a second chance, he changes his mind when Sable refuses to drop her lawsuit. In \\"The Letter\\", Zach buys an expensive painting for Sable, who refuses to be bought but is drawn into a kiss. Sable accidentally hits Constance with her car, and then finds a letter Constance tried to destroy that suggests Jeff may not have been fathered by Philip. Though Constance only has a concussion, Sable is filled with remorse in \\"The Turning Point\\". She drops her lawsuit against Constance and tries to reconcile with Jason, who says it is too late. Sable rejects the painting from Zach. She is shocked when a drunken Miles mentions Jason and Frankie's attraction to each other. Sable tries to stop Jason from divorcing her by threatening to expose Frankie's indiscretions, but Jason is unmoved. Sable reveals the letter concerning Jeff's paternity in \\"Thursday's Child\\", but Frankie reassures Jeff he is Philip's son. Sable is angry that Zach has been manipulating her family, but she cannot deny her attraction to him. In \\"The Pact\\", Sable threatens to use the letter against Frankie unless Jeff gives up Fallon. Jason agrees not to divorce Sable if she stops trying to prove in court that Jeff is not a Colby. In \\"Fallon's Choice\\", Constance discovers that Sable gaslighted her to make her seem confused. When Fallon chooses Jeff over Miles, Sable gives the letter to Miles, who intends to use it against Jeff in court. Jason blames Sable for showing the letter to Miles in \\"The Trial\\", and neither he nor Constance can convince Miles to drop the case. Sable calls out Frankie as a slut in public. In \\"Burden of Proof\\", Sable is shocked to hear Jason claim to be Jeff's father in court, and vows to never forgive him. Zach comforts Sable. She and Jason agree to divorce in \\"My Father's House\\", and she rejects Frankie's attempt at a reconciliation. Sable wants the house in the divorce, and though Jason is willing, Constance refuses to sell her half to him. Despite everything that Jason has done to her, Sable cannot sleep with Zach. She spends a platonic night as his penthouse, where Miles is shocked to find her. Sable is \\"The Outcast\\" horrified by the idea of Jeff and Fallon's wedding, which Jason insists she plan. Sable explains her being at Zach's place to Miles, and then clashes with Fallon over wedding arrangements. Constance's private investigator records a conversation in which Zach professes to Sable his desire to sleep with her. Sable enrages Jason when she attacks Frankie again. In \\"The Wedding\\", Sable asks both Zach and Miles not to attend Jeff and Fallon's nuptials, but both men ignore her. Sable has hope for her marriage when it is clear Jason is still attracted to her. Sable is desperate when Miles is arrested for murder, and seeks comfort with Jason in \\"The Honeymoon\\". Knowing it will irk Sable, Constance invites Frankie to move into the pool house. Frankie, already angry with Sable, accepts. Sable is horrified when Miles tells her that he blacked out and does not know whether he committed the murder or not. Sable tells Zach in \\"Double Jeopardy\\" that she hopes to reconcile with Jason. Sable tries to mend fences with Constance, who does not believe Sable is being genuine. Sable overhears Frankie telling Constance that she is now divorced. In \\"A Family Affair\\", Sable remains unable to convince Constance of her good intentions, but manages to ingratiate herself to Jason by offering concern for Jeff, who has also been arrested for murder. Witnessing the chemistry between Jason and Frankie, Sable makes Frankie believe that she and Jason have reconciled and spent the night together, and does not admit that she is aware of Frankie's divorce. Believing Jason still loves Sable, Frankie is surprised when he proposes to her. Leaving for Greece to investigate Jeff's case, Jason and Frankie are joined by Sable, who has invited herself along for moral support. Sable tortures Frankie with details of her renewed relationship with Jason in \\"The Reckoning\\". Sable is terrified when it seems like Miles has jumped bail, and when he reappears she makes it clear she is willing to lie in court to give him an alibi. Fearful that when Jason divorces Sable she will ally with Zach against the Colbys, Constance gives Jason the tape of Sable and Zach. In \\"Anniversary Waltz\\", Miles turns down Sable's offer to perjure herself on his behalf. Faced with a surprise anniversary party planned by Sable, Jason presents the tape to her and says he loves Frankie. Jason confronts Zach, who he suspects framed Jeff and Miles, and they fight for Zach's gun. Sable arrives and is shot. In \\"Checkmate\\", Jason is overcome with guilt when he learns that a hospitalized Sable may lose her sight. Zach tells Jason that he loves Sable, but she has never been unfaithful. When the news comes that Sable will recover, a remorseful Jason tells her she will always be special to him, and gives her the tape. Sable takes this, and her belief that Jason confronted Zach over her, as a profession of Jason's love. She is distraught when he tells her he is going to the Dominican Republic to get a divorce. Sable chases after Jason to stop him but trips and falls down the stairs. Hurt and angry, she tells the district attorney that Jason attacked her. Jason is arrested. The Colbys season two In the season two premiere \\"The Gathering Storm\\", Sable refuses pleas from Frankie and Miles to drop the charges against Jason. He asks her to do so himself, and Sable says she will if he gives up his plan to divorce her. Sable's lawyer, Arthur Cates (Peter White), makes it clear that she will need Zach to testify for her. She goes to Zach and sleeps with him before asking him to back her up in court, but he refuses to lie for her. Sable is angry and humiliated in \\"No Exit\\", and seeing Jason and Frankie together ignites another tirade against Frankie. Despondent, Sable asks Monica for advice, and confesses that she lied to the police about Jason and now wants to drop the charges. Jason confronts Zach, certain he encouraged Sable's accusations, but learns that Zach refused to lie for Sable. Taking Arthur's advice, Sable drops the charges and, to avoid legal repercussions, pleads temporary mental incompetence brought on by her shooting. The family is happy with Sable's decision, but Jason is convinced that she only did it because Zach would not back her up. Frankie is appalled when Jason throws Sable out of the mansion, but she faints before she can leave. In \\"Jason's Choice\\", the doctor advises the family that Sable needs to stay in bed for a week. Sable decides that it is best for her to leave, but Miles, Monica, and Bliss ask Jason to let her remain in the mansion. Jason agrees if she does not oppose the divorce. She accepts, but Frankie is not happy about it. Jason gives the divorce papers to Sable in \\"The Matchmaker\\", while Zach gives her the Excelsior, the hotel he bought from Dominique. Zach offers to teach Sable how to wield the power she will receive by way of her divorce settlement. Sable encourages Miles to make up his mind about his new girlfriend, Channing Carter (Kim Morgan Greene), unaware that she has been sent by her uncle, ruthless publisher Lucas Carter (Kevin McCarthy), to be his spy within the Colby family. When Channing accepts Miles's proposal and tells Lucas she will no longer spy for him, he maligns her with lies to Sable, who accompanies Lucas to Las Vegas to stop the wedding. Learning of their plan, Channing convinces Miles to marry her immediately in \\"Something Old, Something New\\". Arriving too late, Sable warns Channing not to hurt Miles like Fallon did. In \\"The Gala\\", Zach advises Sable to ask for class C stock in her divorce settlement, and Arthur recommends she offer Jason a quick divorce in exchange. Sable pressures Jason to give Miles a seat on the Colby Enterprises board, but he insists that Miles first needs to prove that he is serious about his marriage. Sable encourages an unreceptive Channing to get pregnant as soon as possible, but is concerned when she learns that Miles is still attracted to Fallon. While investigating Channing's fertility in \\"Bloodlines\\", Sable inadvertently discovers that the paternity of Fallon's child is uncertain, and deduces that the father may very well be Miles. In \\"Deceptions\\", Miles is furious when Sable reveals that he may be the father of Fallon's baby. Sable follows Jason and Frankie to Brussels in \\"And Baby Makes Four\\". In \\"Bid for Freedom\\", Sable helps convince Jason to assist Bliss's Russian ballet dancer boyfriend, Kolya Rostov (Adrian Paul), in defecting to the US. In \\"Sanctuary\\", Sable learns from Zach that Scott Cassidy (Coleby Lombardo), the young son of Senator Cash Cassidy (James Houghton) and his wife Adrienne (Shanna Reed), is really Monica's son with Cash whom she gave up for adoption eight years before. Sable confirms this with Monica, and advises her not to tell Jason yet. Meanwhile, Sable encourages Miles to resolve his latest issues with Channing because he will need a wife to get custody of Fallon's baby. Angry with Arthur for keeping her in the dark about Monica's child, Sable compels him to help her fix the situation now. In \\"Power Plays\\", Sable goes behind Monica's back and tries to convince Adrienne to give up Scott as a means to give Jason his first grandchild. Adrienne refuses and lashes out at Monica, who warns an indignant Sable to stay out of her private life. With Zach's guidance, Sable creates a stir at her first Colby Enterprises board meeting, embarrassing Jason and then shocking him with the news that she co-owns with Zach an electronics company involved in Jason's satellite project. At the Excelsior, Jason reproaches Zach for weaponizing Sable against him, and Zach offers to call her off if Jason lets him into the project. With Constance presumed dead in a plane crash, in \\"The Legacy\\" Sable pretends to be affected and apologizes to Jason for all she did to Constance. Sable is triumphant when Constance's voting power is left to Miles, but she is disappointed when he will not use his new power to help her. Sable suggests that Monica tell Jason the truth about Scott in \\"The Home Wrecker\\", but Monica recognizes her mother's self-serving motives and forbids Sable from telling Jason. Sable tells Zach that his attacks on Colby Enterprises are also attacks on her, and he responds with an engagement ring. She asks for more time to decide. In \\"The Manhunt\\", Sable tries to convince Cash and Monica that Scott will be better off away from Adrienne, who has had addiction issues and made suicide attempts. Zach pressures Sable for an answer to his proposal in \\"All Fall Down\\", but she runs back to Jason when she learns that he was almost shot. She is pained to learn that Jason and Frankie are engaged. Jason tries to talk Sable out of marrying Zach, who Jason believes is dangerous. Sable assures him she is not ready to jump from one marriage to another so quickly. After Fallon falls down the stairs, her baby is in jeopardy in \\"Guilty Party\\". Sable tries to calm a distraught Miles, who is more afraid to lose Fallon than the child. Sable and Frankie find common ground in their concern for the baby. Sable and Monica finally talk about Monica's pregnancy and Scott's birth. In \\"Fallon's Baby\\", Sable continues investigating Adrienne, and witnesses Adrienne telling Cash that she is taking Scott back to Washington. Cash and Monica again refuse Sable's interference. Jason tries to convince Sable that her machinations will only alienate her children. Zach wants an answer to his proposal, but Sable is still smarting over Jason and Frankie's engagement. In \\"Answered Prayers\\", Sable is as upset as Miles that Fallon's baby is not his, and recommends that he distance himself from Fallon. Sable and Jason sign their divorce papers as friends, but Sable assures him that he will not be happy with Frankie. Frankie hopes to patch things up with Sable before her wedding to Jason, but Sable is unforgiving. Monica and Miles are worried that Sable plans to marry Zach. In Marrakech, with Zach, Sable can only think about the wedding happening in Los Angeles. In \\"Return Engagement\\", Sable and Zach are set to marry when Sable learns that presumed-dead Philip Colby (Michael Parks), Frankie's ex-husband and Jeff's father, has returned. Sable reconnects with Philip and assures him that Frankie loves Jason, but Philip is doubtful. Sable witnesses a near-kiss between Philip and Frankie. Zach, spurned again by Sable, suggests to Adrienne that they help each other with their problems. Sable rebuffs Zach in \\"Devil's Advocate\\", and commiserates with Philip about wanting to reunite with their former spouses. Sable is furious in \\"Betrayals\\" when she learns from Monica that Zach tried to blackmail Cash about Scott. Sable lashes out at Zach and returns his ring, vowing never to return to him. When Jason comes home unexpectedly, Sable tries to keep him away from the pool house where Philip is visiting Frankie, but Jason finds his fianc√©e and his brother in bed together. In \\"The Dead End\\", Sable tries to keep Jason and Philip apart, but they fight brutally. Jason remembers Sable's warning about Frankie, and thanks her for trying keep him away from the pool house to spare his feelings. Zach apologizes to Sable for his misdeeds, and though she believes he is remorseful, she is not in love with him and wants to stop the charade. Philip steals Sable's Colby Enterprises access card and steals sensitive information for Zach. In the series finale \\"Crossroads\\", Zach tells Sable that the person who tried to kill Jason is Philip, which she tells Jason. After witnessing Monica's heartbreaking goodbye to Scott, Sable picks the boy up from school without the Cassidys' consent and persuades him to come with her. Dynasty season nine Sable appears in Denver in \\"A Touch of Sable\\". She runs into her cousin Alexis Colby, who befriends Sable's wealthy friend Hamilton Stone (Christopher Neame) to aid her in recovering her ships, which are being held in the African nation of Natumbe. Sable flirts with Alexis's ex-husband Dex Dexter (Michael Nader) in \\"She's Back\\", which merely amuses him. In \\"Alexis in Blunderland\\", Stone has earned Alexis's trust, and Sable uses his new inside knowledge of Colbyco's business dealings to attempt to seize control of Alexis's oil tankers. Tasked to sell the Carlton Hotel for Alexis, Dex inadvertently sells it to Sable in \\"Every Picture Tells a Story\\". When Fallon shows her an old photo of Blake with a man recently found dead in the Carrington lake, Sable suggests that Fallon talk to her mother Alexis about his identity. Sable tells Blake he has her support if the story comes out, as the dead man is Roger Grimes (J. Eddie Peck), Alexis's lover from 25 years before. Sable's friendship with Blake's wife Krystle deepens in \\"The Wedding\\". Krystle recognizes the man whom Sable has been sending to dive in the lake, Gibson (Stan Sells), so Sable tells him to discontinue his efforts. In \\"Ginger Snaps\\", Jeff accuses Sable of trying to replace Krystle at Blake's side. Having discovered an underground passage, Gibson continues his investigation, only to be warned away from Denver by Sable in \\"Delta Woe\\". Sable and Dex flirt after they each independently follow Colbyco's comptroller, Fritz Heath (Kenneth Tigar), to a casino. In \\"Tankers, Cadavers to Chance\\", Sammy Jo Carrington (Heather Locklear) recognizes Gibson as the man Krystle described, and Gibson threatens Sable to get him out of police custody. Alexis romances Dex to get him away from Sable, but soon Sable taunts Alexis with the news that she has taken possession of Alexis's tankers. Blake confronts Gibson in \\"All Hands on Dex\\", and learns that Sable hired him. Blake accuses Sable of acting on her ex-husband Jason's behalf, but before she can explain, Alexis arrives and vows to destroy them both. Heath becomes indebted to Sable when she acquires his gambling marker, and she jubilantly throws herself in Dex's arms. In \\"Virginia Reels\\", Sable tells Blake and Dex she was searching the lake to discover what Jason was keeping hidden there. She explains that she had no idea Blake and Dex would be harmed by her investigation, and Dex is intrigued by her honesty. Jealous of Dex's interest in Sable, her assistant Joanna Sills (Kim Terry) befriends Adam Carrington (Gordon Thomson. Sable threatens to reveal that Heath is embezzling money from Colbyco unless he helps her obtain leverage against Alexis. He demands $5 million for such information, and when Sable laughs, he pulls a gun on her. Sable is able to convince Heath to lower the gun in \\"House of the Falling Son\\", and he tells her how she can ruin Colbyco. Rattled by the encounter, Sable goes to Dex and they spend the night together. Sable questions Joanna's loyalty when she confronts Sable for putting herself between Joanna and Dex, and Dex later rebuffs Joanna's advances. Sable apologizes to Dex for their night together, saying she respects his love for Alexis. But despite their mutual protestations that their encounter meant nothing, they fall into bed together again. Adam tries to charm Joanna into spying on Sable for him and Alexis in \\"The Son Also Rises\\". Sable's doubts about Joanna are confirmed when she sees Joanna go into Adam's suite. Sable asks Dex if he will choose Blake over Alexis if they go to war, and Joanna accepts Adam's offer. Sable's daughter, Monica, comes to Denver for a visit, and Sable convinces her to stay and help her with her campaign to destroy Alexis. In \\"Grimes and Punishment\\", Joanna tells Adam everything she knows about Sable. Alexis reveals to a shocked Sable that her tankers have been destroyed, and Sable vows revenge. Alexis is devastated to learn that Dex slept with Sable, and Monica tries to persuade Jeff to take Sable's side in the impending war between Alexis and Sable. In \\"Sins of the Father\\", Alexis is emotionally crushed by Dex's affair with Sable. Seeing a painting that Roger Grimes gave to Alexis, Sable deduces the secret of the lake. Blake confesses to her and Dex that hidden beneath the lake is a Nazi treasure of precious art innocently obtained by his father which the Carrington, Colby, and Dexter families have kept secret to protect their reputations. The treasure vanishes in \\"Tale of the Tape\\", and Blake tasks Sable to find out what Alexis may know about it. Jeff warns Blake not to trust Sable. Sable serves Alexis with a lawsuit with which she intends to ruin her cousin. Alexis indicates she knows a secret or two about Sable. Sable learns that Alexis is having the painting appraised in \\"No Bones About It\\", and convinces the appraiser to tell Alexis it is worthless. Sable learns she is pregnant in \\"Here Comes the Son\\", but is unable to tell Dex he is the father. An altercation between Jeff and Adam in \\"Blasts from the Past\\" prompts Alexis to reveal in front of Sable and Monica that Jason is not Miles or Monica's father. A furious Sable attacks Alexis. Sable tells Dex that he is the father of her baby, but rejects his offer to help raise the child. Sable confides in Blake that twins Miles and Monica were the products of rape. Having learned about the Nazi treasure, Alexis offers to spare Blake public scorn in \\"Catch 22\\" if Sable withdraws her lawsuit against Colbyco. Sable agrees. Later, Sable is an eyewitness to a fight between Dex and Adam at the Carlton Hotel that sends them toppling off a balcony with Alexis.

History U.S. naval officer Stephen Decatur boarding a Tripolitan gunboat during the First Barbary War, 1804 The United States' relationship with the Middle East prior to World War I was limited, although commercial ties existed even in the early 19th century. President Andrew Jackson established formal ties with the Sultan of Muscat and Oman in 1833. (The Sultan saw the U.S. as a potential balance to Britain's overwhelming regional influence.) Commercial relations opened between the U.S. and Persia in 1857, after Britain persuaded the Persian government not to ratify a similar agreement in 1851. Britain and France took control of most of the former Ottoman Empire after defeating it in World War I. They held mandates from the League of Nations. The United States refused to take any mandates in the region and was \\"popular and respected throughout the Middle East\\".Fawcett, L., (2005) The International Relations of the Middle East, UK: Oxford University Press, p. 284 Indeed, \\"Americans were seen as good people, untainted by the selfishness and duplicity associated with the Europeans.\\"Fawcett, L. (2005) The International Relations of the Middle East UK: Oxford University Press p 285 American Christian missionaries brought modern medicine and set up educational institutions all over the Middle East as an adjunct to their religious proselytizing. Moreover, the United States had provided the Middle East with highly skilled petroleum engineers.Rugh, W. A. (2005) American Encounters with Arabs: The Soft Power of U.S. Public Diplomacy in the Middle East U.S.: Praeger Publishers Inc. pp 25‚Äì26 Thus, there were some connections made between the United States and the Middle East before the Second World War. Other examples of cooperations between the U.S. and the Middle East are the Red Line Agreement signed in 1928 and the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement signed in 1944. Both of these agreements were legally binding and reflected an American interest in control of Middle Eastern energy resources, namely oil, and moreover reflected an American \\"security imperative to prevent the (re)emergence of a powerful regional rival\\".Le Billon, P., El Khatib, F. (March 2004) \\"From free oil to 'freedom oil': terrorism, war and U.S. Geopolitics in the Persian Gulf\\", Geopolitics, Volume 9, Issue 1 p. 109 The Red Line Agreement had been \\"part of a network of agreements made in the 1920s to restrict supply of petroleum and ensure that the major [mostly American] companies ... could control oil prices on world markets\\".Review (Winter 1982): \\"State Power and Industry Influence: American Foreign Oil Policy in the 1940s\\", International Organization 36, no. 1 p. 168 The Red Line agreement governed the development of Middle East oil for the next two decades. The Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement of 1944 was based on negotiations between the United States and Britain over the control of Middle Eastern oil. Below is shown what the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had in mind for to a British Ambassador in 1944: > Persian oil ... is yours. We share the oil of Iraq and Kuwait. As for Saudi > Arabian oil, it's ours.Yergin, D (1991) The Prize: The Epic quest for Oil, > Money and Power New York: Simon and Schuster p 401 King Ibn Saud converses with President Franklin D. Roosevelt on board the USS Quincy, after the Yalta Conference in 1945 On August 8, 1944, the Anglo- American Petroleum Agreement was signed, dividing Middle Eastern oil between the United States and Britain. Consequently, political scholar Fred H. Lawson remarks, that by the mid-1944, U.S. officials had buttressed their country's position on the peninsula by concluding an Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement that protected \\"all valid concession contracts and lawfully acquired rights\\" belonging to the signatories and established a principle of \\"equal opportunity\\" in those areas where no concession had yet been assigned.Lawson, F.

Princeton University Press. p. 36 By the end of the Second World War, the United States had come to consider the Middle East region as \\"the most strategically important area of the world.\\"Chomsky, Noam (January/February 2005) \\"Imperial Presidency\\", Canadian Dimension, Vol. 39, No. 1 p. 8 and \\"one of the greatest material prizes in world history,\\" argues Noam Chomsky. For that reason, it was not until around the period of World War II that America became directly involved in the Middle East region. At this time the region was going through great social, economic and political changes and as a result, internally the Middle East was in turmoil. Politically, the Middle East was experiencing an upsurge in the popularity of nationalistic politics and an increase in the number of nationalistic political groups across the region, which was causing great trouble for the English and French colonial powers.

(1981), Success in Twentieth Century World Affairs since 1919, Norwich: John Murray (Publishers) Ltd p. 295 In truth, this nationalistic political trend clashed with American interests in the Middle East, which were, as Middle East scholar Louise Fawcett argues, \\"about the Soviet Union, access to oil and the project for a Jewish state in Palestine\\".Fawcett, L. (2005), International Relations of the Middle East UK: Oxford University Press, p. 284 Hence, Arabist Ambassador Raymond Hare described the Second World War, as \\"the great divide\\" in United States' relation with the Middle East, because these three interests would later serve as a backdrop and reasoning for a great deal of American interventions in the Middle East and thus also come to be the cause of several future conflicts between the United States & the Middle East.  Formation of Israel  In 1947, the U.S. and the Truman administration, under domestic political pressure, pushed for a solution and resolution on the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, and in May 1948 the new state of Israel came into existence. This process was not without its fights and loss of lives. Nevertheless, \\"the first state to extend diplomatic recognition to Israel was the United States; the Soviet Union and several Western nations quickly followed suit. No Arab state, however, recognized Israel.\\"McWilliams, W, C, Piotrowski, H, (6th ed.)(2005) The World since 1945: A History of International Relations U.S. Lynne Rienner Publishers p 154  Syria: 1949  Syria became an independent republic in 1946, but the March 1949 Syrian coup d'√©tat, led by Army Chief of Staff Husni al-Za'im, ended the initial period of civilian rule. Za'im met at least six times with CIA operatives in the months prior to the coup to discuss his plan to seize power. Za'im requested American funding or personnel, but it is not known whether this assistance was provided. Once in power, Za'im made several key decisions that benefitted the United States. He approved the Trans-Arabian Pipeline (TAPLINE), an American project designed to transport Saudi Arabian oil to Mediterranean ports. Construction of TAPLINE had been delayed due to Syrian intransigence. Za'im also improved relations with two American allies in the region: Israel and Turkey. He signed an armistice with Israel, formally ending the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War and he renounced Syrian claims to Hatay Province, a major source of dispute between Syria and Turkey. Za'im also cracked down on local communists. However, Za'im's regime was short-lived. He was overthrown in August, just four and a half months after seizing power.  Mosaddeq and the Shah  Supporters of Mohammed Mosaddeq in 1952 Opposed to foreign intervention in Iran and a keen nationalist, Mohammed Mosaddeq became the prime minister of Iran in 1951. Thus, when Mosaddeq was elected he chose to nationalize the Iranian oil industry, where previously British holdings had generated great profits for Britain through the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Furthermore, prior to the nationalisation of Iranian oil Mosaddeq had also cut all diplomatic ties with Britain.Dionisi, D, J(2005) American Hiroshima: The reasons why and a call to strengthen America's Democracy, Canada: Trafford Publishing, , pp 30‚Äì38 The Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was opposed to the nationalisation of Iranian oil as he feared this would result in an oil embargo, which would destroy Iran's economy and thus, the Shah was very concerned with the effect of Mosaddeq's policies on Iran. Equally worried were workers in the Iranian oil industry, when they experienced the economic effect of the sanctions on Iranian oil exports which Mosaddeq's policies had resulted in, and riots were happening across Iran.Immerman, R. H., Theoharis, A. G. (2006) The Central Intelligence Agency: Security under Scrutiny U.S.: Greenwood Press, , p. 314 Thus, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi asked Mosaddeq to resign, as was the Shah's constitutional right, but Mosaddeq refused, which resulted in national uprisings. The Shah, fearing for his personal security, fled the country but nominated General Fazlollah Zahedi as new Prime Minister. Although General Fazlollah Zahedi was a nationalist, he did not agree with the Mosaddeq's lenient attitude towards the communist Tudeh party, which the United States had also become increasingly concerned with, fearing Soviet influence spreading in the Middle East. Therefore, in late 1952, the British government asked the U.S. administration for help with the removal of Mohammed Mosaddeq. President Harry S. Truman thought Mossadeq was a valuable bulwark against Soviet influence. However, Truman left office in January 1953, and the new administration of Dwight Eisenhower shared British concern over Mossadeq. Allen Dulles, the director of the CIA, approved one million dollars on April 4, 1953 to be used \\"in any way that would bring about the fall of Mossadegh\\"Dionisi, D, J(2005) American Hiroshima: The reasons why and a call to strengthen America's Democracy, Canada: Trafford Publishing, , p. 40 Consequently, after a failed attempt on August 15, \\"on August 19, 1953, General Fazlollah Zahedi succeeded [with the help of the United States and Britain] and Mossadegh was overthrown. The CIA covertly funneled five million dollars to General Zahedi's regime on August 21, 1953.\\" This CIA operation, often referred to as Operation Ajax and led by CIA officer Kermit Roosevelt, Jr., ensured the return of the Shah on August 22, 1953.  The Suez Crisis  President Eisenhower press conference about the crisis, 9 August 1956 Although accepting large sums of military aid from the United States in 1954, by 1956 Egyptian leader Nasser had grown tired of the American influence in the country. The involvement that the U.S. would take in Egyptian business and politics in return for aid, Nasser thought \\"smacked of colonialism.\\"Lesch, D, W(ed.) (2003) The Middle East and the United States: A Historical and Political Reassesment U.S.: Westview Press, p. 94 Indeed, as political scholar B.M. Bleckman argued in 1978, \\"Nasser had ambivalent feelings toward the United States. From 1952 to 1954 he was on close terms with U.S. officials and was viewed in Washington as a promising moderate Arab leader. The conclusion of an arms deal with the USSR in 1955, however, had cooled the relationship between Cairo and Washington considerably, and the Dulles-Eisenhower decision to withdraw the offer to finance the Aswan High Dam in mid-1956 was a further blow to the chances of maintaining friendly ties. Eisenhower's stand against the British, French, and Israeli attack on Egypt in October 1956 created a momentary sense of gratitude on the part of Nasser, but the subsequent development of the Eisenhower Doctrine, so clearly aimed at 'containing' Nasserism, undermined what little goodwill existed toward the United States in Cairo.\\"Bleckman B, M, Kaplan, S, S (1978) Force Without War: U.S. armed Forces As a Political Instrument U.S.: The Brookings Institution p 249 \\"The Suez Crisis of 1956 marked the demise of British power and its gradual replacement by USA as the dominant power in the Middle East.\\"Attie, C. C. (2004) Struggle in the Levant, Kings Lynn: The Centre for Lebanese Studies, Oxford p 1 The Eisenhower Doctrine became a manifestation of this process. \\"The general objective of the Eisenhower Doctrine, like that of the Truman Doctrine formulated ten years earlier, was the containment of Soviet expansion.\\"Attie, Struggle in the Levant, p. 109 Furthermore, when the Doctrine was finalised on March 9, 1957, it \\"essentially gave the president the latitude to intervene militarily in the Middle East ... without having to resort to Congress.\\"Attie, Struggle in the Levant, p. 110 indeed as, Middle East scholar Irene L. Gerdzier explains \\"that with the Eisenhower Doctrine the United States emerged \\"as the uncontested Western power ... in the Middle East.\\"Gettleman, M, E, Schaar, S (2003) The Middle East and Islamic World Reader, U.S.: Grove Press p. 248 Jordan Meanwhile, in Jordan nationalistic anti-government rioting broke out and the United States decided to send a battalion of marines to nearby Lebanon prepared to intervene in Jordan later that year. Douglas Little argues that Washington's decision to use the military resulted from a determination to support a beleaguered, conservative pro Western regime in Lebanon, repel Nasser‚Äôs pan-Arabism, and limit Soviet influence in the oil- rich region. However Little concludes that the unnecessary American action brought negative long-term consequences, notably the undermining of lebanon's fragile, multi-ethnic political coalition and the alienation of Arab nationalism throughout the region.Douglas Little, \\"His finest hour? Eisenhower, Lebanon, and the 1958 Middle East crisis.\\" Diplomatic History 20.1 (1996): 27-54. To keep the pro-American King Hussein of Jordan in power, the CIA sent millions of dollars a year of subsidies. In the mid-1950s the U.S. supported allies in Lebanon, Iraq, Turkey and Saudi Arabia and sent fleets to be near Syria.Stephen Ambrose, The Rise to Globalism: American Foreign Policy, 1938‚Äì1980 (1980) p. 463 However, 1958 was to become a difficult year in U.S. foreign policy; in 1958 Syria and Egypt were merged into the \\"United Arab Republic\\", anti-American and anti-government revolts started occurring in Lebanon, causing the Lebanese president Chamoun to ask America for help, and the very pro-American King Feisal the 2nd of Iraq was overthrown by a group of nationalistic military officers.Eisenhower, White House Years, vol. 2: Waging Peace 1956‚Äì1961 (1965) p. 268 It was quite \\"commonly believed that [Nasser] ... stirred up the unrest in Lebanon and, perhaps, had helped to plan the Iraqi revolution.\\"R. Louis Owen, A Revolutionary year: The Middle East in 1958 (2002) p. 2  The Six-Day War and Black September  In June 1967 Israel fought with Egypt, Jordan, and Syria in the Six-Day War. As a result of the war, Israel captured the West Bank, Golan Heights, and the Sinai Peninsula. The U.S. supported Israel with weapons and continued to support Israel financially throughout the 1970s. On September 17, 1970, with U.S. and Israeli help, Jordanian troops attacked PLO guerrilla camps, while Jordan's U.S.-supplied air force dropped napalm from above. The U.S. deployed the aircraft carrier Independence and six destroyers off the coast of Lebanon and readied troops in Turkey to support the assault. The American interventions in the years before the Iranian revolution have all proven to be based in part on economic considerations, but more so have been influenced and led by the international Cold War context.Watson, J. B. (1981) Success in Twentieth century World Affairs since 1919 Norwich: John Murray (Publishers) Ltd p. 301  Iran‚ÄìIraq War =Support for IraqSupport for Iran= Saudi Arabia  President Obama with King Salman of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh, 27 January 2015 Saudi Arabia and the United States are strategic allies, but relations with the U.S. became strained following September 11 attacks. In March 2015, President Barack Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a \\"Joint Planning Cell\\" with Saudi Arabia. The report by Human Rights Watch stated that US-made bombs were being used in attacks indiscriminately targeting civilians and violating the laws of war.  Afghanistan and Pakistan  Afghanistan and Pakistan, though situated in South Asia, are considered part of the Greater Middle East. U.S. intervention in both Afghanistan and Pakistan started with the Carter Administration after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The relations of the U.S. with Afghanistan and Pakistan have been closely tied to the War on terrorism that has happened there. American policy has been instrumental in coordinating the ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan. In recent times, political situations of both countries have been bracketed under a single theater of operations, denoted by the newly coined American term \\"AfPak.\\"Terry H.

Career Born in Weymouth, Dorset, Cave was studying engineering when he started his career in non-League football with hometown club Weymouth in 1966. He joined Torquay United in July 1968, soon settling into the Plainmoor side. Although not a regular goalscorer (17 goals in 114 league games), when he did score they tended to be memorable. In July 1971 a fee of ¬£15,000 took him to Bournemouth. His first season at Dean Court was a struggle, and in March 1972 he joined Plymouth Argyle on loan. However, he returned to Bournemouth and eventually played 99 league games, scoring 17 goals, before a ¬£18,000 transfer to York City in August 1974. His first season was York's first ever in the Second Division and they confounded expectations by surviving, although they were relegated the following season (with Cave winning the Clubman of the Year award). He spent the 1976 season on loan in the American Soccer League, helping the Los Angeles Skyhawks win the ASL title. In February 1977, after scoring 13 times in 96 league games for York, he returned to Bournemouth for a fee of ¬£10,000. He spent the summer of 1977 on loan to North American Soccer League side Seattle Sounders, scoring 12 goals in 22 appearances, and joined Seattle permanently the following summer after playing the last of his 42 league games for Bournemouth, in which he had scored three times. He spent the 1978 and 1979 seasons in Seattle. He then played the 1979‚Äì80 indoor season with the Pittsburgh Spirit in the Major Indoor Soccer League, scoring 24 goals in 27 games. In 1980, he began the season with the Sounders, but played only one game before being released. He finished the season with the Cleveland Cobras of the ASL. He then joined the Hartford Hellions for the 1980‚Äì81 MISL season, in which he made 38 appearances and scored 24 goals, before finishing his career with two seasons back at the Pittsburgh Spirit. Cave died in his home in Aleppo, Pennsylvania on 6 November 1984, aged 35, from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning (running his car in a garage). At the time he was assistant coach of the Pittsburgh Spirit of the MISL. He has since had the Player of the Year Award named after him in his honour at Bournemouth.

The foundation was set up to honor the memory of the more than 320 journalists from all sides who died while covering the conflicts in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia from 1945 to 1975. Its other main aim was to assist colleagues in a region that was emerging from decades of war, poverty and isolation-remembering the dead by helping the living. Two legal entities were established, one based in Bangkok, Thailand, the other in the United Kingdom. Each operated entirely independently with separate, self-generated funding. IMMF-Thailand got seed funding when members of the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Thailand passed round a hat one evening after a program with Tim Page in 1991. Over US$ 40,000 was raised in 1992 at a sellout auction in Bangkok of over a hundred photographs from Indochina - old and new, at war and at peace. All the photographs were donated by the photographers themselves or their estates. Photographs sold from the Vietnam War era included work by James Caccavo, Greg Davis, Hubert Van Es, John Everingham, Horst Faas, Sean Flynn, Henri Huet, Luong Nghia Dung, Francoise de Mulder, Roland Neveau, Nguyen Van Bao, Tim Page, Dana Stone, Tiziano Terzani and Lance Woodruff. A similar auction a few years later, also in Bangkok, raised more funds. IMMF-Thailand provided training for nearly 900 journalists from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar, conducting 23 regional training courses in Thailand and 25 workshops in the five countries from 1994 to 2009. It pioneered the concept of bringing journalists from the region together on courses as well as training media inside military-ruled Myanmar prior to 2010 and in remote areas of Laos. A number of IMMF-Thailand alumni have been promoted to senior positions in radio broadcast, television, photography and the print media. Outstanding alumni were assisted in obtaining scholarships and entry into media studies in Europe and the United States. IMMF-Thailand also commissioned, edited and published journalism training manuals in English and five of the vernaculars of mainland Southeast Asia. These continue to be widely used. In 1995, IMMF-Thailand provided a grant to the Photo Archive Group in Cambodia to preserve archival photos of the Tuol Sleng Museum of Genocide in Phnom Penh. It commissioned reports on the state of historic films held in Vietnamese and Lao film archives. IMMF-Thailand also sponsored reports on the state of journalism and the media in the five countries it served and shared this information with other development organizations. IMMF-Thailand's courses focused on basic skills and sound journalistic practices and normally revolved around specific themes including the environment, agriculture, ethnic minorities, social issues and business-economics. Experts were invited as lecturers but IMMF-Thailand's emphasis was on an \\"outdoor classroom,\\" with students spending segments of every course in the field. Trainers were all former or practicing journalists, and highly regarded in their fields. Many came through Britain's Thomson Foundation. IMMF-Thailand's regional courses, conducted in English, averaged 16 students and lasted four weeks. The shorter in-country workshops, mainly in Laos and Myanmar, were taught through interpreters. Several exhibitions of photographs from the courses were staged and a number of articles by IMMF-Thailand alumni were published in Bangkok newspapers. The organization was supported by major private organizations, government agencies and individual donors in 13 Asian, European and North American countries. Co-Presidents Dominic Faulder, a British correspondent, editor and writer, and Denis D. Gray, an Associated Press correspondent who covered the Vietnam War, headed IMMF-Thailand from 1994 to 2009 after founding president Charles Antoine de Nerciat of the news agency Agence France- Presse returned to France. Project Director Sarah McLean, a former official with the British Foreign Office, organized courses, obtained funding and handled administration. IMMF-Thailand ceased active training on March 31, 2009 and dissolved its board and administrative staff, transferring its remaining funds to the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Thailand which continues to update IMMF training manuals, oversee its web site and conduct other legacy activities. IMMF-United Kingdom has organized four workshops for photojournalists, all of them held in Vietnam. The first was held in Ho Chi Minh City in 2002 with more than 40 participants. The second was organized in Hanoi in 2005 with over 50 attendees. Others were conducted in 2007 and 2010. In 1997, two of its members, Tim Page and Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer Horst Faas, published Requiem, a collection of images by the photographers who died in Vietnam and Indochina.

The series is named after the Falmouth Packet service, which commenced operation in about 1688.  Circulation  Weekly circulation for all Packet titles was 39,350 as of 27 February 2013, 32% greater than that of their regional rival, Northcliffe Media's The West Briton, which had a circulation of 29,710 on the same date.  The Falmouth & Penryn Packet  The Falmouth & Penryn Packet is a weekly tabloid newspaper sold in and around the towns of Falmouth and Penryn on the southern coast of western Cornwall. Several newspapers have borne the title Falmouth Packet in the past. The earliest, founded in 1801, was the Cornwall Gazette & Falmouth Packet, which lasted under that title for less than two years when the proprietor, one Thomas Flindell (1767-1824), was imprisoned for debt. It was the first Cornish newspaper. In 1803 Flindell moved his operations to Truro and started the Royal Cornwall Gazette and Western Advertiser, which ultimately was absorbed into The West Briton following a bitter feud between the two publications. The second Falmouth Packet was the Falmouth Packet & Cornish Herald, founded in 1829 and published until 1848. The third, Lake's Falmouth Packet & Cornwall Advertiser, is the ancestor of the present-day Falmouth & Penryn Packet; it started publication in 1858. The current Falmouth & Penryn Packet is the lead title in a series of Packet weekly paid-for tabloids for central and western Cornwall.  The Helston Packet  The Helston Packet is a weekly tabloid newspaper sold in and around the town of Helston in southern Cornwall, including Porthleven, Mullion and The Lizard peninsula. It was first published in 1969. All Packet titles are published by Packet Newspapers from editorial offices in Falmouth.  Website  All the Packet titles, plus the closely associated Helston & District Gazette, share a common website - www.thepacket.co.uk.  Company history  Packet Newspapers used to be part of the Express Newspapers group (and, before that, its predecessor Beaverbrook Newspapers), but as of 1987 is a subsidiary of the Newsquest newspaper group's South West division. There are currently (February 2013) four Packets - The Falmouth/Penryn Packet, The Helston Packet, The West Cornwall Packet, and The Packet (covering Truro, Camborne and Redruth); in 2010 the Penwith Pirate was replaced by the West Cornwall Packet. They all come out on Wednesdays.

He is best remembered for his time at Schalke 04. He operated mostly as a defensive midfielder. Oude Kamphuis was originally a midfielder, but could also double up as a defender. He started his career at FC Twente, where he spent five years, before leaving for German side, FC Schalke 04. After Schalke, Oude Kamphuis joined Borussia M√∂nchengladbach, another German-based side. He ended his playing football career at FC Twente, because of long term injuries. Club career=FC Twente Oude Kamphuis was born in Hengelo.

Film and television career Ng has appeared in 80 films to date. He has twice been nominated for the Best Actor Award at the Hong Kong Film Awards, for his roles in Winners and Sinners and Beyond the Sunset. He has worked alongside some of the biggest names in Hong Kong action cinema including Jackie Chan, Michelle Yeoh, Andy Lau and Jet Li. 1970s, 80s and 90s Ng's first role was in the 1976 Michael Hui comedy film The Private Eyes. It was the first of many films Ng would appear in with Sammo Hung throughout the next 30 years. In 1979, Ng made his only film as director, Murder Most Foul. He also starred in the film and co-wrote it with Wong Jing. In 1983, he appeared as \\"Exhaust Pipe\\" in Hung's film Winners and Sinners, a template to the Lucky Stars series. He would go on to appear in all of the subsequent Lucky Stars films throughout the 1980s, in fundamentally the same role, though his character name in the later films was \\"Sandy\\". Ng came to the fore in all 4 of the Pom Pom series, alongside fellow Lucky Star, John Shum. The Pom Pom films were something of a spinoff from the Lucky Stars series, though more comedy than action-orientated. Sammo Hung worked as producer on the first three, and as action director on the first two, and all four films were released by Hung's production companies, Bo Ho Films and D&B; Films. The first film, Pom Pom! featured cameos from Sammo Hung, Charlie Chin and Stanley Fung as their characters from Winners and Sinners. Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao, who had also appeared in the Lucky Stars films also made cameo appearances. In the series, Ng plays \\"Ng Ah Chow\\" (or Ng Ah Chau), whilst Shum plays \\"Beethoven\\", a pair of inept and lovelorn cops. The first three Pom Pom films fared well at the domestic box office, taking between HK $17 and HK $20 million each, a sum comparable to contemporaries such as the original Lucky Stars trilogy, Chan's Project A and Hung and Biao's Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain. Ng became an established actor, and was given supporting roles in a number of popular Hong Kong action comedies including Wheels on Meals (1984), Millionaire's Express (1986) and Jackie Chan's Miracles (1989). Throughout the 1990s he appeared in at least 8 further films with Sammo Hung, including Once Upon a Time in China and America. 2000s: British TV and Father & Son films As of 1997, Richard Ng moved to live in London, England and was said to be semi-retired. However, he is clearly still very active, having made several appearances on British television since that time, and he is also continuing to work on Hong Kong films. Since it started in 2002, Ng has appeared in several episodes of the ongoing BBC Scotland soap, River City (under the name Richard Woo). His character is \\"Johnny Wu\\", the owner of the \\"Wok My World\\" takeaway. In 2003 he appeared in the second Tomb Raider film, The Cradle of Life. In 2004, he appeared in a deleted scene in an episode of Black Books. He also appeared in the commercial for the video game Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks He also appeared in an episode of The Bill in 2005, and an episode of the Nickelodeon UK series, Genie in the House in 2006. In 2009, he played in Red Dwarf: Back to Earth as Swallow the Nose Maker, a maker of prosthetics. Ng could be seen on British television, playing a shopkeeper in an advertisement for RAC, alongside Lennox Lewis, and in another advertisement for satellite television, dressed as an eskimo. He also played the emperor of China in a Channel 4 docu-drama, The Great Wall of China. It was first shown on October 1, 2007 at 9pm. In 2008, he appeared as Sifu Chien, the Shaolin master of Hong Kong policeman, Terry Phoo (Eddie Shin) in the pilot episode of the BBC Three program, Phoo Action. In 2000, Richard Ng appeared alongside his son, Carl Ng, in the film Love at First Sight a.k.a. Sausalito. The two have since appeared together several more times, including in Dante Lam's Jiang hu: The Triad Zone (2000), Lemon Crush (2002), Sammo Hung's Legend of the Dragon (2004) and the Jingle Ma film, Happy Birthday (2007). Ng and son will also appear together in three forthcoming films. The first of these is Magazine Gap Road, which is completed and due for release in 2007. This will be followed by Bodyguard: A New Beginning, which is currently filming, and in 2008, Jessica Caught on Tape. He had a cameo appearance in the 2016 film Skiptrace. Personal life Ng was educated in England and returned to live in London in 1997. He is married to his wife, Susan, a British woman who worked as Bruce Lee's hair stylist in the 1970s. Together, they have four children, event producer Alex Ng, Zoe Ng, Louise Ng and actor Carl Ng.

Building on the years of consulting experience Tobias Eigen had with African civil society, Kabissa began by providing African organizations with accessible, affordable, and secure internet services. During the next three years Kabissa showed strong growth and gained increasing recognition. In June, 2002 Kabissa won the ICT Stories Competition, an initiative of infoDev and the International Institute of Communication and Development (IICD) which sought to capture the learning process that accompanies the introduction and implementation of ICTs for development. In September, 2002 Kabissa added a part-time Program Manager, Kim Lowery, to its staff. By November, 2002 Kabissa was awarded its first major grant from the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) for the pilot phase of Kabissa‚Äôs Time To Get Online training initiative. They went on to set up an office at Dupont Circle in Washington DC where for the next five years three employees and dozens of interns and volunteers worked on its programs with funding from major foundations including the Ford Foundation, Open Society Institute Information Program, the Hurford Foundation, National Endowment for Democracy, Yahoo Employee Foundation, and Lonely Planet Foundation (now Planet Wheeler Foundation). They also trained hundreds of activists and development practitioners in end user and training of trainers workshops and distributed thousands of copies of the Time To Get Online manual. In partnership with Tanmia in Morocco, the Time To Get Online manual and training program was localized into French and Arabic. From April 2005 through March 2008, Kabissa administered the PanAfrican Localisation Project, which was funded by the International Development Research Centre of Canada. In 2007, Kabissa followed its founder, Tobias Eigen, to Bainbridge Island, WA in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and became a volunteer organization with no employees.

Because Grabone is not his real surname, sometimes his name appears as Georg Arnold- Grabon√©.  Biography =Early life Born in Munich on September 11, 1896, Arnold was the son of the Regional-President Wilheim von Arnold. He went to study at Munich Art Academy. In 1914 the young Arnold passed his Abwalt (exit examination), and volunteered as an enlistee in the German Army. While serving in World War I. he suffered a head injury from a grenade explosion. The injury left him temporarily without hearing or speech. Because of his injuries he was discharged from the army. He returned to his Schwabian homeland. Maturity Without the benefit of any additional schooling, Arnold began to paint everything he saw. Although his speech and hearing returned, he could not abandon his love of painting. He began to study formally in Stuttgart and then studied Cubism in Vienna under Professor Lippert. Here he became a member of a circle of painters known as the ‚ÄúLicht- Gruppe‚Äù. Arnold abandoned these experimental forms and returned to more traditional painting. Some years later he would write ‚ÄúIch bin kein freund der Abstracten kunst‚Äù (I am no friend of abstract art). After Vienna, Arnold returned to in Munich where studied landscape painting under Heinrich von Z√ºgel and Leo von Konig. After Munich, he traveled to Berlin where he further refined his painting style under the well-known German impressionist Max Liebermann. Arnold once wrote that Liebermann made him into a true painter. On his stylistic naturalism, Arnold once wrote: \\"Ich gebe die Stimmung der Landschaft so wieder, wie ich sie emfinde und wie sie auch der Betrachter empfinden soll\\" (I show the texture of the landscape in the way that I feel it and, as also how I want the viewer to feel it) In 1928 Arnold was awarded a gold medal in Vienna for his oil painting: Hardanger Fjord. In 1932 he moved to Zurich to teach at an art academy. He later became its Rector. In 1936 he began to use the name Grabon√© as a \\"kunstlername\\" rather than Arnold. Grabon√© was derived from Garabronn, the place which contained his family home. His painter friends included Otto Pippel and Franz Xavier Woffel. Although he was financially successful as a painter, Arnold painted because of his love of the aesthetic. Once, it is told, he traded a painting for taxi fare. Relationship with Eisenhower and Churchill In 1951 U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower was stationed in Garmisch as the commander of occupied Europe. Sir Winston Churchill encouraged Eisenhower to take up painting as a hobby. Eisenhower followed Churchill‚Äôs advice and began to take lessons from Arnold- Grabon√©. At that time Arnold-Grabon√© had his studio only a few miles from Eisenhower‚Äôs headquarters. For a period of time Eisenhower flew twice weekly from Paris to F√ºrstenfeldbruck, and then by automobile to Tutzing where he took his art lessons from the professor. They formed a friendship and one of Arnold-Grabon√©‚Äôs paintings hung in the White House. Later the former president hung one of the paintings, \\"Zugspitze\\" in his home in Gettysburg. . Arnold- Grabon√©‚Äôs circle of American friends acquired at NATO headquarters also included General Nordstrom and Robert L. Scott (author of \\"God is my copilot\\"). The artist marketed his works to the junior officers stationed at NATO headquarters and he often invited them to exhibitions his work. As a consequence, many young American officers purchased paintings and brought them back to the United States. Through Eisenhower, Arnold-Grabon√© eventually became acquainted with Sir Winston Churchill. Churchill was interested in the artist's spatula technique and asked him for some tutelage. The two of them spent several weeks one summer in the early 1950s painting together on the Isle of Man. Although he maintained his studio in Tutzing the artist exhibited throughout the world. In the 1950s and 1960s Arnold-Grabon√© had exhibitions in the United States, including New York City, Chicago, Washington DC and Sarasota, Florida. Former President Lyndon B. Johnson owned in his private collection an original Grabon√© titled \\"Arber\\". Death After a fight with cancer, Arnold-Grabon√© died on February 10, 1982 near Starnberg in Bavaria. He was survived by his wife, Sofie, their one son, Warner, his daughter Renate Arnold (Renee Dow and Renee Hubbell) from his previous marriage, and his two grandsons, Robert Dow and Thomas Dow. His great grandchildren, Patrick Cooper Dow and Jack Alexander Dow.  Artistic style  Arnold-Grabon√© became well known for his unique style of Palette knife painting. His technique used the texture of thickly applied paint to create an actual three-dimensional representation of a landscape. In Grabon√©‚Äôs works, the colors are remarkable for their brilliance, distinguishing his landscapes from those of other pallet-knife painters. The brilliance is a result of Grabon√©‚Äôs color- separation technique in knife-painting. His favorite subjects were of the Alps of Bavaria and South Tirole, the Isle of Capri, the English Garden in Munich, the lake region surrounding Starnberg, and fishing boats on the North Sea. His unusual signature is incised into the wet paint with the opposite end of the brush, almost invariably on the bottom left hand of his oil paintings (and on the bottom right for watercolors).

According to James Paul Gee, affinity spaces are locations where groups of people are drawn together because of a shared, strong interest or engagement in a common activity.Gee, 2004; Gee, 2005; Gee & Hayes, 2009 Often but not always occurring online, affinity spaces encourage the sharing of knowledge or participation in a specific area, and informal learning is a common outcome. In his coining of the term, Gee takes the notion of participatory cultures and reframes it to the idea of \\"space\\". To Gee, what is happening in these online cultures is not merely a \\"culture\\" ‚Äì and far different from a \\"community\\". In Gee's view, the word \\"community\\" conjures up images of belongingness and membership (p. 70).Situated Language and Learning: A Critique of Traditional Schooling. New York: Routledge, 2004. , Instead, he has defined these worlds as \\"spaces\\" ‚Äì a term that allows for the \\"robust characterization of the ebbs and flows and differing levels of involvement and participation exhibited by members\\" According to Gee (2004), \\"An affinity space is a place or set of places where people affiliate with others based primarily on shared activities, interests, and goals, not shared race, class culture, ethnicity, or gender\\" (p. 67). Gee (2004) refers to affinity spaces and states, \\"Learners 'apprentice' themselves to a group of people who share a certain set of practices (e.g. learning to cook in a family, learning to play video games with a guild, learning to assemble circuit boards in a workplace, learning to splice genes in a biology lab), pick up these practices through joint action with more advanced peers, and advance their abilities to engage and work with others in carrying out such practices\\" (p. 70). What Gee (2004) tries to explain about Affinity Spaces is not an attempt to label a group of people. By affinity space he means a space where people can interact and share a lot with each other. the people who are interacting in a space might find themselves as sharing a community with some others in that space, while other people might view their interactions in the space differently. Gee (2004) adds, \\" In any case, creating spaces within diverse sorts of people can interact is a leitmotif of the modern world\\" (p. 71).  Hallmarks of Affinity Spaces  Gee described twelve hallmarks of what he terms \\"nurturing\\" affinity spaces: # The affinity in these spaces is to the endeavor, not other people. People from all ages, ethnicities, educational levels, and cultures play/create together ‚Äì often anonymously or using alter-identities. # Not segregated by age; there is no assumption that older or more senior participants are the only ones with something to teach. # Not segregated by experience; newbies, masters, and everyone else share a common space. # Everyone can, if they so wish, produce and not just consume. The idea that creation can come not only from a space's designers, but also from its users, is a hallmark of these spaces. Users ‚Äì not just site designers ‚Äì can help create, shape, and reshape the site and its content. Suggestions are welcome and encouraged, and site designers often use the suggestions of users to reform site designs and configurations. # Content within the space is not fixed, but is transformed by interaction. # Both intensive and extensive knowledge are encouraged. Extensive knowledge is seen as broad, less specialized knowledge about many aspects of the space. Intensive knowledge is in-depth knowledge about certain aspects of the space. # Individual and distributed knowledge are valued. # Dispersed knowledge is encouraged. # Tacit knowledge is encouraged and honored. Members do not have to lead or design; those who wish to ‚Äújust play‚Äù are valued as much as those who wish to contribute more substantially to the site. # Many forms and routes to participation are available. # Different routes to status are inherent in the game. # Leadership is porous and leaders are resources. Educational uses Because members of an affinity space are interested in a common practice/belief/activity, they have common ground and motivation together. Gee says that because of this common interest, affinity spaces are able to bridge barriers of age, race, socio-economic status, and educational level, and thus allow each user to participate as he/she chooses, and both experts and novices are equally legitimate participants in the affinity spaceGee, 2005 While not everyone in affinity spaces is an expert, they are not places where the \\"blind are leading the blind.\\" Many spaces have unwritten rules that while sharing information, you must share only what you know, provide sources to back up what you say, and in general, leave feedback and comments only in areas you know. Examples Online fan fiction sites are examples of affinity spaces. While the goal of the sites is usually to share and read other people's fan fiction creations, informal learning takes place as people have their work read and commented on by \\"'beta readers.'\\" It is up to the author then to decide what to do with this informal feedback; often, it is used to revise and edit the work, and at the same time, it may aid the author in pinpointing his or her own overall writing flaws. Other examples come from \\"snark sites\\" or \\"rant communities.\\" The goal of these sites is typically to make fun of particular problems, such as poorly written fan fiction,FanFicRants or digital image editing mistakes.Photoshop Disasters As community members criticize other people's work, they reach new levels of sophistication in their evaluations, creating extended vocabularies of terms and categorizing mistakes. In Benjamin Bloom's taxonomy, evaluation is at the top of higher order thinking skills. Since either authors or their friends and fans are likely to come to the defense of works being criticized, rhetoric and logic are two areas where much active learning takes place.

Usually chestnut, they are a compact, muscular breed known for their calm and willing temperament. The breed was originally developed for use in agriculture, but today is more often seen in urban settings and at horse shows. Some of the best known members of the breed pull beer wagons for the Carlsberg brewery around Copenhagen, as well as at competitions and for demonstrations. Images from the 9th century show a horse similar to the Jutland being used by Viking raiders in what is now Great Britain. The first written record is from the 12th century, when they were popular as war horses. Some infusion of bloodlines from other breeds occurred in the 18th century, but the modern Jutland type only began about 1850 with the addition of blood from several other breeds, mainly draft horses. A stud book was created in the late 19th century, and the Jutland population grew to a maximum around 15,000 by 1950. Numbers subsequently declined, and as of 2011, only an estimated 1,000 horses remained. Characteristics The Jutland is typically chestnut, but may also be bay, gray, black, or roan, and frequently has white markings. In the early 1900s, most Jutlands were bay or black, but those colors are now in the minority; chestnut is now considered to be the horse's \\"national color\\" and is selectively bred. They generally stand between , and weigh between . The breed has a convex facial profile, a short, arched neck, low withers, a wide chest and straight shoulder, and a slightly sloped croup. Overall, it is a compact, muscular breed. Their temperament is calm yet energetic, and they are considered by breed enthusiasts to be willing workers. Although compact in size, the Jutland is a strong, powerful horse that was used to transport carriages and heavy goods. An 1897 publication by the United States Bureau of Foreign Commerce noted the ability of the horse to pull carriages, and stated, \\"For this class of work and for heavy draft generally there is probably no better animal than the Jutland horse‚Äîa heavy, powerful beast.\\" History Jutlands pulling a Carlsberg beer wagon in Copenhagen The origins of the breed are not fully documented, but some evidence points to the ancestors of the Jutland being used by the Vikings during the early 9th century. Images from the time show Viking raiders in what is now Great Britain riding horses similar in appearance to the modern Jutland. Some of those horses may have been left behind, contributing to the base stock from which the Suffolk Punch was eventually developed. Horses from Jutland were exported to England, Germany, and France during the Middle Ages, and were popular mounts for knights, especially for use in jousting. The first mention of the Jutland type is from the 12th century, when they are documented as war horses with many useful attributes. The Jutland horse appears in the Danish ballad \\"Svend Felding's Kamp med Risen\\", in which mythic hero Svend F√¶lling goes on a pilgrimage to Rome and on his journey encounters a giant. Other horses prove too shy or too weak to enable him to confront the giant, so Svend obtains a Jutland horse from a passing miller, who claims that it is strong enough to carry 15 skippund. Mounted on the Jutland, Svend succeeds in killing the giant. The Frederiksborg horse, another Danish breed, influenced the Jutland during the 18th century. The Frederiksborg had a significant amount of Spanish influence, and was used to give the Jutland more active gaits. Selection for the modern-day Jutland appears to have begun around 1850, when Suffolk Punch and Ardennes blood was crossbred on native bloodstock. Cleveland Bay and Yorkshire Coach Horse (a Cleveland Bay/Thoroughbred cross) horses were also added during the 19th century. The development of the breed was significantly influenced by a stallion named Oppenheim LXII, imported into Denmark in 1862. Sources disagree as to whether Oppenheim was a purebred Suffolk Punch or a Suffolk/Shire cross. Six generations from Oppenheim, his descendant, Aldrup Munkedal (spelled Oldrup Munkedal in some sources), was foaled. Aldrup Munkedal is considered the founding stallion of the modern breed. Most Jutlands alive today descend from two of his sons, Hovding and Prins af Jylland. The Jutland strongly resembles the Schleswig, another heavy draft breed with similar origins that was influenced by Oppenheim LXII and his descendants. With the exception of feathering on its lower legs, the Jutland also resembles the Suffolk Punch. The first stud book for the breed was created in 1881, and 22,000 horses were registered between then and 2007. In 1887, the first breeders' association was formed. The first stallions were evaluated according to breed standard in 1888, the same year the Cooperative Jutlandic Breeding Association was created. In 1898, the \\"Federated Funen Horse Breeding Societies\\" were established in Funen, dedicated to the development of Jutland horse breeding and other heavy draught horses. By the 1950s, Jutland population numbers exceeded 15,000, and 405 stud farms were devoted to their breeding in Denmark, but since that time, population numbers have dwindled. Though numbers dropped, a 2008 study of the 716 Jutland horses in the Danish studbook at that time concluded that little risk of the Jutland becoming extinct existed due to inbreeding or low genetic diversity. The study, which also included populations of the Knabstrupper and Fredericksborg breeds, theorized that the greatest loss to genetic diversity for horses in Denmark would be through the extinction of the Jutland breed, because of its genetic distance from the other two native breeds. The level of genetic diversity of the three Danish breeds was found to be similar to other European breeds. As of 2011, one Danish breed conservation organization estimates that about 1,000 Jutlands remained. Uses Although originally bred for use on farms, few members of the breed are used for agricultural purposes today, and are now mostly bred for horse shows and working in urban areas. However, the Carlsberg brewery has used the Jutland to pull its drays since 1928. The brewery owned 210 Jutlands at their peak, and today still uses about 20 for transporting beer around Copenhagen. The Carlsberg horses also compete and put on demonstrations at many shows, promoting the brewery and the breed.

Energy is the capability of some substances, resulting from their physico-chemical properties, to do work or produce heat. Some energy commodities, called fuels, release their energy content as heat when they burn. This heat could be used to run an internal or external combustion engine. The need to have statistics on energy commodities became obvious during the 1973 oil crisis that brought tenfold increase in petroleum prices. Before the crisis, to have accurate data on global energy supply and demand was not deemed critical. Another concern of energy statistics today is a huge gap in energy use between developed and developing countries. As the gap narrows (see picture), the pressure on energy supply increases tremendously.Global energy consumption per capita, 1950-2004 The data on energy and electricity come from three principal sources: * Energy industry * Other industries (\\"self-producers\\") * Consumers The flows of and trade in energy commodities are measured both in physical units (e.g., metric tons), and, when energy balances are calculated, in energy units (e.g., terajoules or tons of oil equivalent). What makes energy statistics specific and different from other fields of economic statistics is the fact that energy commodities undergo greater number of transformations (flows) than other commodities. In these transformations energy is conserved, as defined by and within the limitations of the first and second laws of thermodynamics.

He proceeded to Oran on board the frigate Termagant, which was placed at his disposal by Lord Nelson. Cardozo was successful in saving the lives of three Royal Navy sailors who were imprisoned at Oran and under the death sentence. A treaty was negotiated by him between the Government of Portugal and the bey of Tunis. He was one of the principal landowners of Gibraltar.

Function  Recent advances in the understanding of biomolecules enabled their application to numerous fields like medicine and materials. Synthetically modified biomolecules can have diverse functionalities, such as tracking cellular events, revealing enzyme function, determining protein biodistribution, imaging specific biomarkers, and delivering drugs to targeted cells. Bioconjugation is a crucial strategy that links these modified biomolecules with different substrates.  Synthesis  Synthesis of bioconjugates involves a variety of challenges, ranging from the simple and nonspecific use of a fluorescent dye marker to the complex design of antibody drug conjugates. As a result, various bioconjugation reactions ‚Äì chemical reactions connecting two biomolecules together ‚Äì have been developed to chemically modify proteins. Common types of bioconjugation reactions on proteins are coupling of lysine amino acid residues, coupling of cysteine residues, coupling of tyrosine residues, modification of tryptophan residues, and modification of the N- and C- terminus. However, these reactions often lack chemoselectivity and efficiency, because they depend on the presence of native amino acid residues, which are usually present in large quantities that hinder selectivity. There is an increasing need for chemical strategies that can effectively attach synthetic molecules site specifically to proteins. One strategy is to first install a unique functional group onto a protein, and then a bioorthogonal or click type reaction is used to couple a biomolecule with this unique functional group. The bioorthogonal reactions targeting non-native functional groups are widely used in bioconjugation chemistry. Some important reactions are modification of ketone and aldehydes, Staudinger ligation with azides, copper-catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition of azides, and strain promoted Huisgen cycloaddition of azides.  Common bioconjugation reactions  The most common bioconjugations are coupling of a small molecule (such as biotin or a fluorescent dye) to a protein, or protein-protein conjugations, such as the coupling of an antibody to an enzyme. Other less common molecules used in bioconjugation are oligosaccharides, nucleic acids, synthetic polymers such as polyethylene glycol, and carbon nanotubes. Antibody-drug conjugates such as Brentuximab vedotin and Gemtuzumab ozogamicin are also examples of bioconjugation, and are an active area of research in the pharmaceutical industry. Recently, bioconjugation has also gained importance in nanotechnology applications such as bioconjugated quantum dots.  Reactions of lysine residues  The nucleophilic lysine residue is commonly targeted site in protein bioconjugation, typically through amine-reactive N-hydroxysuccinimidyl (NHS) esters. To obtain optimal number of deprotonated lysine residues, the pH of the aqueous solution must be below the pKa of the lysine ammonium group, which is around 10.5, so the typical pH of the reaction is about 8 and 9. The common reagent for the coupling reaction is NHS-ester (shown in the first reaction below in Figure 1), which reacts with nucleophilic lysine through a lysine acylation mechanism. Other similar reagents are isocyanates and isothiocyanates that undergo a similar mechanism (shown in the second and third reactions in Figure 1 below). Benzoyl fluorides (shown in the last reaction below in Figure 1), which allows for lysine modification of proteins under mild conditions (low temperature, physiological pH), were recently proposed as an alternative to classically used lysine specific reagents. 409x409px  Reactions of cysteine residues  Because free cysteine rarely occurs on protein surface, it is an excellent choice for chemoselective modification. Under basic condition, the cysteine residues will be deprotonated to generate a thiolate nucleophile, which will react with soft electrophiles, such as maleimides and iodoacetamides (shown in the first two reactions in Figure 2 below). As a result, a carbon-sulfur bond is formed. Another modification of cysteine residues involves the formation of disulfide bond (shown in the third reaction in Figure 2). The reduced cysteine residues react with exogenous disulfides, generating new a disulfide bond on the protein. An excess of disulfides is often used to drive the reaction, such as 2-thiopyridone and 3-carboxy-4-nitrothiophenol. Electron-deficient alkynes were demonstrated to selectively react with cysteine residues of proteins in the presence of other nucleophilic amino acid residues. Depending on the alkyne substitution, these reactions can produce either cleavable (when alkynone derivatives are used), or hydrolytically stable bioconjugates (when 3-arylpropiolonitriles are used; the last reaction below in Figure 2). 409x409px  Reactions of tyrosine residues  Tyrosine residues are relatively unreactive; therefore they have not been a popular targets for bioconjugation. Recent development has shown that the tyrosine can be modified through electrophilic aromatic substitutions (EAS) reactions, and it is selective for the aromatic carbon adjacent to the phenolic hydroxyl group. This becomes particularly useful in the case that cysteine residues cannot be targeted. Specifically, diazonium effectively couples with tyrosine residues (diazonium salt shown as reagent in the first reaction in Figure 3 below), and an electron withdrawing substituent in the 4-position of diazonium salt can effectively increase the efficiency of the reaction. Cyclic diazodicarboxyamide derivative like 4-Phenyl-1,2,4-triazole-3,5-dione (PTAD) were reported for selective bioconjugation on tyrosine residues (the second reaction in Figure 3 below). A three-component Mannich-type reaction with aldehydes and anilines (the last reaction in Figure 3) was also described to be relatively tyrosine-selective under mild optimised reaction conditions. 409x409px  Reactions of N- and C- termini  Since natural amino acid residues are usually present in large quantities, it is often difficult to modify one single site. Strategies targeting the termini of protein have been developed, because they greatly enhanced the site selectivity of protein modification. One of the N- termini modifications involves the functionalization of the terminal amino acid. The oxidation of N-terminal serine and threonine residues are able to generate N-terminal aldehyde, which can undergo further bioorthogonal reactions (shown in the first reaction in Figure 4). Another type of modification involves the condensation of N-terminal cysteine with aldehyde, generating thiazolidine that is stable at high pH (second reaction in Figure 4). Using pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), several N-terminal amino acids can undergo transamination to yield N-terminal aldehyde, such as glycine and aspartic acid (third reaction in Figure 4). 307x307px An example of C-termini modification is the native chemical ligation (NCL), which is the coupling between a C-terminal thioester and a N-terminal cysteine (Figure 5). 527x527px Bioorthogonal reactions Modification of ketones and aldehydes = A ketone or aldehyde can be attached to a protein through the oxidation of N-terminal serine residues or transamination with PLP. Additionally, they can be introduced by incorporating unnatural amino acids via the Tirrell method or Schultz method. They will then selectively condense with an alkoxyamine and a hydrazine, producing oxime and hydrazone derivatives (shown in the first and second reactions, respectively, in Figure 6). This reaction is highly chemoselective in terms of protein bioconjugation, but the reaction rate is slow. The mechanistic studies show that the rate determining step is the dehydration of tetrahedral intermediate, so a mild acidic solution is often employed to accelerate the dehydration step. 410x410px The introduction of nucleophilic catalyst can significantly enhance reaction rate (shown in Figure 7). For example, using aniline as a nucleophilic catalyst, a less populated protonated carbonyl becomes a highly populated protonated Schiff base. In other words, it generates a high concentration of reactive electrophile. The oxime ligation can then occur readily, and it has been reported that the rate increased up to 400 times under mild acidic condition. The key of this catalyst is that it can generate a reactive electrophile without competing with desired product. 421x421px Recent developments that exploit proximal functional groups have enabled hydrazone condensations to operate at 20 M‚àí1s‚àí1 at neutral pH while oxime condensations have been discovered which proceed at 500-10000 M‚àí1s‚àí1 at neutral pH without added catalysts. = Staudinger ligation with azides = The Staudinger ligation of azides and phosphine has been used extensively in field of chemical biology. Because it is able to form a stable amide bond in living cells and animals, it has been applied to modification of cell membrane, in vivo imaging, and other bioconjugation studies. 500x500px Contrasting with the classic Staudinger reaction, Staudinger ligation is a second order reaction in which the rate-limiting step is the formation of phosphazide (specific reaction mechanism shown in Figure 9). The triphenylphosphine first reacts with the azide to yield an azaylide through a four-membered ring transition state, and then an intramolecular reaction leads to the iminophosphorane intermediate, which will then give the amide-linkage under hydrolysis. 565x565px = Huisgen cyclization of azides  Copper catalyzed Huisgen cyclization of azides  Azide has become a popular target for chemoselective protein modification, because they are small in size and has a favorable thermodynamic reaction potential. One such azide reactions is the [3+2] cycloaddition reaction with alkyne, but the reaction requires high temperature and often gives mixtures of regioisomers. 460x460px An improved reaction developed by chemist Karl Barry Sharpless involves the copper (I) catalyst, which couples azide with terminal alkyne that only give 1,4 substituted 1,2,3 triazoles in high yields (shown below in Figure 11). The mechanistic study suggests a stepwise reaction. The Cu (I) first couples with acetylenes, and then it reacts with azide to generate a six-membered intermediate. The process is very robust that it occurs at pH ranging from 4 to 12, and copper (II) sulfate is often used as a catalyst in the presence of a reducing agent. 519x519px  Strain promoted Huisgen cyclization of azides  Even though Staudinger ligation is a suitable bioconjugation in living cells without major toxicity, the phosphine's sensitivity to air oxidation and its poor solubility in water significantly hinder its efficiency. The copper (I) catalyzed azide-alkyne coupling has reasonable reaction rate and efficiency under physiological conditions, but copper poses significant toxicity and sometimes interferes with protein functions in living cells. In 2004, chemist Carolyn R. Bertozzi's lab developed a metal free [3+2] cycloaddition using strained cyclooctyne and azide. Cyclooctyne, which is the smallest stable cycloalkyne, can couple with azide through [3+2] cycloaddition, leading to two regioisomeric triazoles (Figure 12). The reaction occurs readily at room temperature and therefore can be used to effectively modify living cells without negative effects. It has also been reported that the installation of fluorine substituents on a cyclic alkyne can greatly accelerate the reaction rate. 486x486px  Examples of Applied Bioconjugation Techniques = Growth Factors  Bioconjugation of TGF-Œ≤ to iron oxide nanoparticles and its activation through magnetic hyperthermia in-vitro has been reported. This was done by using 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)ethylcarbodiimide combined with N-Hydroxysuccinimide to form primary amide bonds with the free primary amines on the growth factor. Carbon nanotubes have been successfully used in conjunction with bioconjugation to link TGF-Œ≤ followed by an activation with near-infrared light. Typically, these reactions have involved the use of a crosslinker, but some of these add molecular space between the compound of interest and base material and in turn causes higher degrees of non-specific binding and unwanted reactivity.

It derives from the Belgian Brabant heavy draft breed. It was developed in the former Soviet Union for agricultural draft work, and was recognized as a breed in 1952. It is one of several heavy draft breeds developed in the Soviet Union in the twentieth century, others being the Russian Heavy Draft ‚Äì which derived mainly from the Ardennais ‚Äì and the Vladimir Heavy Draft, which was derived principally from the Clydesdale.  History  The Russian Empire had no indigenous breeds of heavy draft horse. The origins of the Soviet Heavy Draft date to the late nineteenth century, at the Khrenovski stud farm in Voronezh Oblast. Imported Brabant draft stallions from Belgium were cross-bred with mares of various types: some were of Ardennais, Jutland, Percheron or Suffolk Punch draft type, others were riding horses. Breeding was later transferred to the Pochinki Stud Farm in Pochinki, in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, with another center at the stud farm of Gavrilov Posad, in Ivanovo Oblast, and another in Mordovia. The breeding range covered a broad area in central-southern Russia. In 1885 there were three Brabant stallions in that area; in 1895 there were fifty-eight, by 1950 almost four hundred, and nearly nine hundred in 1945. There was strong demand for powerful agricultural horses, and the area of influence of the Brabant stallions spread. They were used in the creation of the Estonian and Lithuanian Heavy Draft breeds. The Soviet Heavy Draft was named and officially recognized in 1952. In 1980 the total population was about 35 000, of which almost 4 000 were pure-bred.  Characteristics  The selective breeding that created the Soviet Heavy Draft resulted in a massively-built horse with free-moving gaits. It has a straight or convex profile, and a short neck. The torso is wide and muscular, with a wide strong back and a muscular sloping croup. The abdomen is rounded. The legs are short and sturdy with solid joints and broad rounded hooves.  Use  The Soviet Heavy Draft was created for draft work in agriculture and industry. It is also used in the production of meat and milk. Mares are moderately fertile (65‚Äì75%), and foals are fast-growing, reaching when weaned. The highest recorded milk yield per lactation is . It was among the breeds used in the development of the Bulgarian Heavy Draft in the later twentieth century.

Coach Kyle Ryan took the head strength and conditioning coach at UNC and that position left him no time to coach rugby. No replacement was found, thus UNCRFC was left without a permanent head coach. The fall went according to plan, going undefeated and winning the ERRFU Division II title for the 3rd straight year. UNCRFC also took a road trip to Las Vegas for a tournament in Sin City UNCRFC went 2-1 beating Utah Valley State, Occidental College and let a lead slip away in a loss to UCLA. As he would do in the spring, University of Wyoming head coach, Rich Cortez, graciously accompanied the club and filled in as head coach. The spring saw a drop in numbers, but also some new players. For the weekend of April 2 and 3, UNCRFC drove to Dallas, Texas for the 2004 West Rugby Football Union collegiate championships. UNC's pool contained the University of Missouri and Baylor University. On Saturday, the first game of the day was versus Mizzou and UNC squeaked by 20-14. The middle game of the day saw Baylor handily beat Mizzou 39-8. The final game of the day put UNC versus Baylor and in a bit of an upset UNC handled the Baylor Bears 43-17.

This soon changed. Dr. Mark Smith took a position in the sports pedagogy department at UNC. Coach Smith was previously the head coach at the University of Georgia and Western Carolina University. Originally from England, Coach Smith was the missing piece to the puzzle. With a full-time head coach came a sense of legitimacy and this secured commitments from players who were on the fence. With some talented new players, and some experienced upper classmen, UNC's national title run began. The fall began with the Jackalope tournament in Laramie, Wyoming. UNC opened up their season with a victory over Division 1 University of Colorado 17-14. They then lost to eventual Division 1 finalist University of Utah 32-6 and ended the weekend beating another Division 1 opponent University of New Mexico, 17-18.UW Mens Rugby  2004 Jackalope Tournament UNC waded through their ERRFU league play with little trouble.

It was released in Japan on January 17, 1997; and in Europe on October 1 of the same year. The game did not see a North American release. It is perhaps one of the least known games on the platform, as a result of its limited release.  Story  The game is set in January, 1997. Akira, a freelance occult journalist, is visited by a woman, whose daughter had left on a trip with her friends and never returned. He agrees to look for the woman's daughter, after being given the last things the woman received from her; including a photo of an old run-down mansion somewhere in Europe, and what seem to be unearthly spirits. Two weeks after this meeting, Akira and his partner Angela, find themselves in a remote European village in front of the very mansion shown in the photos. This is where the game begins.  Characters  *Akira: (Age: 23) A freelance occult journalist for the past three years, Akira is yet to write an article based on an actual paranormal experience. His work so far has been selling faked ghost photos and fabricated articles to specialist magazines. *Angela: (Age: 21) As Akira's partner, Angela accompanies him to Europe to help him find the missing teenagers. *Linda, Toshi, Dave: (Ages: 18, 17, 18) The missing senior high school students who Akira and Angela have been tasked with locating. *Paulo: (Age: 26) Akira and Angela first meet Paulo in the mansion, and he appears to be extremely knowledgeable about the occult and the mansion in particular. He may hold the key to finding the missing teenagers, though his actions are shrouded in mystery. Gameplay The gameplay is considered unique by some, with mechanics such as opening curtains to bring more light into a room in order to solve a puzzle or defeat an enemy. Aiming weapons is difficult, as there are no crosshairs or weapons on screen. The player must get enemies to center of their screen and fire. They also have the option of assigning and initiating 4 specific commands or actions to the shoulder buttons (R1, R2, L1, L2). Most time in-game is spent wandering around searching and uncovering what action to initiate. The game doesn't give a large number of hints where to go and what action to perform.

It replaces an older chapel that burned down in 1920. Designed in 1921 by Ralph Adams Cram in his signature Collegiate Gothic style, it was built by the university between 1924 and 1928 at a cost of $2.3 million. Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered a sermon there in 1960. The chapel was rededicated in an interfaith ceremony in 2002 following a major two-year restoration. Its size and design evoke a small cathedral of the English Middle Ages. The only university chapel of its size at the time it was built was King's College Chapel at the University of Cambridge. The foundation is poured concrete, and the superstructure is sandstone and limestone. The main sanctuary consists of a narthex, a gallery, a nave, two transepts joined by a crossing, and an elevated choir. The chapel's extensive iconography consists of stained glass, stonemasonry, and wood carvings. Among the stained glass are four \\"great windows\\", one facing each cardinal direction, and four \\"Christian epic\\" windows in the walls of the choir. The iconography was planned by Albert M. Friend, a faculty member in Princeton's Department of Art and Archaeology, with the goal of portraying, in one scholar's words, a \\"synthesis between Christian faith and modern thought.\\"Milliner, Primus inter pares. The chapel seats almost 2,000 people. A nondenominational chapel, it hosts weekly ecumenical Christian services and daily Catholic Masses. It also hosts several annual special events, such as baccalaureate services and commencements. History Princeton University built the chapel to replace the Marquand Chapel, which stood between where the present chapel and McCosh Hall stand until it burned to the ground in 1920. The location for the new chapel was chosen for two reasons: symbolically, the new chapel would rise from the ashes of the old one, and practically, it would locate the new chapel centrally as the campus expanded eastward.Rhinehart, p. 50. Ralph Adams Cram, the university's supervising architect, designed and oversaw construction of the new chapel. Cram sought to build a crown jewel for the Collegiate Gothic motif he had championed on the Princeton campus. The university's president, John Grier Hibben, also had a stake in the project: student hostility toward Princeton's brand of mainline Presbyterianism was on the rise. An ordained minister, Hibben hoped the new chapel's majesty would inspire students to attend services of their own volition. Cram, a convert to High Church Episcopalianism from Unitarianism, also lent support to this aim. Cram designed the chapel with the assistance of Alexander Hoyle, a member of his firm. Albert M. Friend, a faculty member in Princeton's Department of Art and Archaeology, played a central role in planning the iconography. It was built by Matthews Construction Company, which worked on several projects on Princeton's campus. Among those who contributed to the design of stained glass windows were Charles Connick, Henry Lee Willet (of the studio that would become Willet Hauser), and Philadelphia-based stained glass artist Nicola d'Ascenzo. The plans for the new chapel were made public in 1921. Hibben called replacing the Marquand Chapel \\"an immediate necessity\\";Quoted in Bush & Kemeny. nonetheless, the project encountered financial problems early on. The insurance money from the Marquand Chapel was insufficient, and fundraising for the chapel competed with an ongoing general capital campaign for the university. Ground was ultimately broken during Princeton's commencement ceremonies in June 1924, and in the following year Cram and Hibben laid the cornerstone. The construction received considerable media attention, as it promised to be the largest university chapel in the United States and the second largest in the world after King's College Chapel, Cambridge. The construction cost about $2.3 million and was completed in 1928. Hibben led the dedication ceremony on May 31 of that year, in an elaborate ceremony covered by TIME. On March 13, 1960, less than six weeks after the first of the Greensboro sit-ins, Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered a sermon at the chapel. In the sermon he called for universal brotherhood and a life of spiritual richness. A plaque on the interior south wall of the chapel's nave commemorates the occasion. The chapel underwent a two-year, $10 million restoration between 2000 and 2002. Despite the complexity of the work, the chapel remained open throughout the restoration. The project earned a New Jersey Historic Preservation Award in 2002, and the stone work won the 2004 Tucker Award for Renovation and Restoration from Stone World magazine. At the time, two experts working on the stained glass restoration called it the largest such project that had ever been undertaken in the United States; too large for a single studio, it was divided among studios in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and New York. Following the restoration, the chapel was rededicated in an interfaith ceremony in which people belonging to Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and Judaism gave prayers. Leading the ceremony, then-Dean of Religious Life Thomas Breidenthal said, \\"This edifice is unmistakably Christian, [but] this chapel is meant to belong to all of us.\\"Quoted in Description The chapel's Collegiate Gothic design evokes an English church of the Middle Ages,Bush & Kemeny.Stillwell, p. 7. although several aspects of it, including the vault and its supports, recall French churches. The chapel is cruciform and is built on the scale of a large parish church or a small cathedral. The only precedent for a university chapel of this size was King's College Chapel, and only a small part of that chapel was used regularly.Stillwell, pp. 5-7. Stillwell cites Exeter Cathedral and the Octagon tower of Ely Cathedral as precedents for the architectural detail, but notes that the Princeton chapel's detail nonetheless differs significantly from these.Stillwell, p. 9. The foundation is made of poured concrete. When the chapel was built, the rest of the structure above the grade level was masonry, and the only metal reinforcement was some structural steel in the framing of the roof. During the 2000-02 restoration, some pinnacles were reset with stainless steel anchors. The arches of the crossing were designed to support the addition of a central tower, but this option has not been exercised: in Bush and Kemeny's words, \\"Cram felt that Princeton already had enough towers.\\" Exterior The exterior, seen from the west. The chapel is approximately the size of a small medieval English cathedral. Measured on the exterior, it is long, wide at its transepts, and high.Stillwell, p. 11. The exterior is constructed largely from Pennsylvania sandstone, with Indiana limestone used for the trim. On the western end of the chapel is the narthex, which has entrances on the north, west, and south walls. An additional door on the chapel's north side opens onto the Hibben Garden, named in recognition of John Grier Hibben's role in the chapel's construction and dedication. The garden of evergreens was designed by H. Russell Butler, Jr.Rhinehart, p. 52. On the chapel's south side are an additional door at ground level to the east and an exterior pulpit, designed after one at Magdalen College, Oxford, and named Bright Pulpit, in honor of John Bright.Stillwell, p. 129. The chapel is connected on its eastern side to Dickinson Hall by the Rothschild arch, symbolizing a connection between religion and scholarship. Cram resigned as Princeton's supervising architect over the inclusion of the arch, which he disliked;Rhinehart, p. 53. nonetheless, he participated in the chapel's 1928 dedication ceremony. Nearby is the Mather Sundial, a replica of the Turnbull Sundial in the courtyard of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. A statue of a pelican, a religious symbol associated with Corpus Christi, sits atop the sundial, which was presented to Princeton in 1907 by William Mather, then the governor of Victoria University of Manchester. Each of the three narthex entrances sits below a tympanum. The model for the tympanum above the main, west entrance was designed and sculpted in clay by John Angel and stone carved by Edward Ardolino. Cram shared credit for the chapel's quality with Ardolino in particular, saying his stone carving was \\"the best of its kind.\\" Ardolino is credited as executing all of the building's stone carving. The tympanum above the west entrance depicts Jesus as described in the Book of Revelation, together with the four beasts and other relevant iconography. It resembles the tympanum of the Royal Portal of Chartres Cathedral. Beneath the figure of Christ is Princeton University's shield, illustrating the university's motto, Dei sub numine viget (\\"Under the power of God she flourishes\\"). The tympana above the north and south entrances depict the Annunciation and the Baptism of Christ, respectively. The latter was sculpted by Robert Baker. The exterior iconography includes two notable whimsical elements. A downspout on the east wall features a relief of a bulldog head; a decades-old myth relates that Cram placed it there to recognize Yale University, whose mascot is the bulldog. (Cram was not a Yale alumnus and in fact did not attend college, so it is unclear what interest he might have had promoting Yale.) A sculptor who worked on the chapel during its construction placed small carvings of his face and Cram's at the bottoms of crockets flanking the main entrance; Cram is identifiable by his glasses. Interior The interior, looking east from about halfway through the nave. The choir and the east window, titled \\"The Love of Christ\\", are in the background. Measured in the interior, the chapel is long, wide at its transepts, and high at the crossing. Most of the interior is limestone, but the aisles and the central area of the choir are Aquia Creek sandstone. Sound-absorbing tile is mounted on parts of the wall and vault. Running west to east, the main sanctuary consists of a narthex, a gallery, a nave, two transepts joined by a crossing, and an elevated choir;Stillwell, p. 8. it seats almost 2,000. The building's southeast corner houses a vestry. Inscribed on the narthex wall facing the nave is \\"A Prayer for Princeton\\",Stillwell, p. 12. which as of 2008 was still used in services at the chapel. Another inscription, from Psalm 100, refers to Westminster Choir College, which holds its commencement ceremonies in the chapel. Two staircases on the east and west of the narthex lead to an upper gallery, which looks out upon the nave. Three doorways lead from the narthex into the nave, which is high and named for Hibben.Rhinehart, p. 51. It is divided into three vertical levels: an arcade at ground level, a triforium beneath the roofs of the aisles, and a clerestory. The configuration and its proportions are typical of English churches, but the nave's vaulted ceiling and the colonnettes supporting it recall French churches. The gallery above the narthex is at the level of the triforium. The aisles are narrower than in medieval churches and are used for passage rather than seating. The south aisle features five window bays, while the north has four;Stillwell, p. 15. where the easternmost bay would be is the entrance to a side chapel called the Blessed Sacrament Chapel.Stillwell describes the iconography around the Blessed Sacrament Chapel but makes no mention of it per se. Milliner (\\"The Princeton University Chapel\\", p. 5) writes that the space was once a broom closet. The pews in the nave are constructed from wood originally intended for Civil War gun carriages; over 100 carvers spent more than a year producing the intricate carvings.Milliner, \\"The Princeton University Chapel\\", p. 5. The northern transept is named for Henry Gurdon Marquand, the benefactor of the Marquand Chapel, which burned to the ground in 1920 and which the present chapel was built to replace.Stillwell, p. 18. An American flag flown by the USS Princeton hangs from the transept's north wall. The southern transept is named for Chester Alwyn Braman, the first donor to the University Chapel Fund. A staircase leads from the Braman Transept to the Bright Pulpit.Stillwell, p. 21. The choir, named Milbank Choir for Elizabeth Milbank AndersonStillwell, pp. 15-6. is elevated by several steps. An altar stands at the far east end. The altar and the choir stalls were built and carved by Irving and Casson, A. H. Davenport Company, in Sherwood Forest oak;Stillwell, pp. 15-7. Cram speculated that the wood may have dated from the time of Robin Hood. According to Stillwell, the woodwork \\"represents an outstanding example of American craftsmanship.\\"Stillwell, p. 17. An oak made pulpit stands in front of the choir facing the nave. It originated in the north of France, probably in the mid-1500s. Its French Renaissance style suggests that it was made during the reign of Henry II. The lectern is also oak and dates from the 1600s. It had been used in a church near Avranches, France, for 200 years. A private individual purchased it shortly before the confiscation of church property during the French Revolution. It changed hands several times before Hibben obtained it for the chapel.Stillwell, pp. 17-8. The chapel's organ has 7,897 pipes in 135 ranks and 109 stops. It was designed by Ernest M. Skinner and installed in 1928. Skinner invented the contra fagotto stop for the Princeton chapel organ in response to a request by Princeton's director of music. In 1990 the organ was dismantled and shipped to England for a major restoration by Mander Organs. Thomas Trotter gave the re-opening recital on the restored organ in 1992. Iconography The interior south wall of the nave. James Madison is shown in brown and royal blue in the rightmost panel of the upper right window. The chapel's iconography consists of over of stained glass as well as stonework and wood carvings. Albert M. Friend, a faculty member in Princeton's Department of Art and Archaeology and an expert on medieval art, was the primary planner of the iconography, with the support and assistance of Hibben, Cram, and others. A devout Christian, Friend shared Hibben's goal of persuading Princeton students to choose lives of Christian observance and sought with the chapel's iconography, in Milliner's words, \\"to carefully dismantle materialist objections to Christian faith and to articulate Princeton's synthesis between Christian faith and modern thought.\\" Kessler calls the stained glass \\"a summa of the heritage of Christianity up to the early twentieth century.\\" The stained glass windows of the nave's north and south aisles represent one aspect of this synthesis. The north windows depict Biblical figures and scenes,Stillwell, pp. 24-30 while the south windows contain images associated with human knowledge. The lower of these, at the triforium level, depict the teachings of Christ, while the six upper windows at the clerestory level depict influential figures in Philosophy, Theology, Chivalry, Poetry, Law, and Science, as read from east to west.Stillwell, pp. 92-7. The Science window faces a window due to Willet on the north wall with scenes from Genesis, symbolizing harmony between the Christian story of the Creation and the modern means of understanding it. Four large stained glass windows are found in the main sanctuary. *The Great East Window, \\"The Love of Christ\\": Milbank Choir. Due to Charles Connick, it is richly decorated with scenes from the life of Christ, culminating with an image of the Crucifixion of Jesus in the great rose.Stillwell, p. 40. The process of selecting the scenes for this window was contentious, pitting the preferences of the conservative Presbyterian Hibben and his colleagues against those of the Milbank family, the window's donors and liberal Episcopalians. The final compromise paired the Works of Mercy with Gospel scenes complementing each of them. *The Great West Window, \\"The Second Coming of Christ\\": the gallery.Stillwell, pp. 97-9. Due to Nicola d'Ascenzo of Philadelphia, this window epitomizes Friend's iconographical argument. To students who would complain of the burdens of religion in daily life, the window answers with John 10:10: \\"I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly.\\" *The Great North Window, \\"Christ the Martyr\\": Marquand Transept. A verse from Mark 13:13, \\"He who shall endure to the end shall be saved\\", is carved below the window, declaring the theme. The lower part of the window shows historical Christians noted for their perseverance.Milliner (\\"The Princeton University Chapel\\", p. 5), identifies one of these, the Belgian cardinal D√©sir√©-Joseph Mercier, as \\"a chief resister to the Nazi occupation in World War II\\". In fact Mercier was a symbol of resistance against German occupation during World War I and died in 1926, 14 years before the Nazi invasion of Belgium. Stillwell, p. 32. *The Great South Window, \\"Christ the Teacher\\": Braman Transept. Here again the theme is declared by a Gospel verse, this time John 8:32, \\"And ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.\\" Noted Christian writers and teachers are depicted at the bottom with the seven liberal arts.Stillwell, p. 35. The doorway to the Blessed Sacrament Chapel on the north wall of the nave is topped by carvings of shields representing three Christian religious centers, Jerusalem, Rome, and Canterbury, and flanked by carvings representing the seven virtues and corresponding seven vices. The other door leaving the Blessed Sacrament Chapel is topped by carvings of shields representing three medieval universities, Oxford, Paris, and Salamanca, and flanked by carvings representing the seven liberal arts (the Trivium and the Quadrivium) and the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. Large stained glass windows due to Connick in the walls of the choir retell four \\"Christian epics\\": the Divine Comedy and Le Morte d'Arthur on the north wall and Paradise Lost and Pilgrim's Progress on the south wall. Milliner notes that images of historical and legendary people carved into the choir's woodwork \\"reflect the intended seating during a Chapel ceremony\\". Images of figures connected to music are carved into the front (west), where the choir would sit, and images of scholars are carved into the back (east), where faculty would sit. Behind the altar are carved images of eight religious figures: four Catholic saints to the north, and four leaders of Protestantism to the south. The epic windows reinforce the idea of a \\"Catholic north\\" and a \\"Protestant south\\": Catholics wrote the north epics and Protestants the south epics. In an ecumenical touch, the north and south are symbolically united by \\"The Love of Christ\\" in the Great East Window.Milliner, \\"The Princeton University Chapel\\", pp. 5-6. Stained glass windows telling the story of the Book of Job are set into the walls of the staircases between the narthex and the gallery.Stillwell, pp. 101-4. Friend was known for delivering popular lectures on Job, and Milliner speculates that Friend had these windows included to address the problem of evil. Connick designed the windows in consultation with Friend, but they were made by others after the former's death. The chapel's iconography pays tribute in places to the other Abrahamic religions. Abraham himself is depicted in a stained glass window on the north side of the nave, together with a Star of David, a Christian cross, and a star and crescent. Other windows show Baruch SpinozaMilliner, \\"The Princeton University Chapel\\", p. 6. and Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi;Milliner, \\"The Princeton University Chapel\\", p. 4 both images were planned before the chapel was built. In several places the chapel's iconography includes images of figures associated with Princeton University: *Jonathan Edwards, Princeton's third president: in the Theology window in the nave's south wallStillwell, p. 92. and again among the Protestant leaders carved into the woodwork in the choir behind the altar. *Joseph Henry, a professor and Trustee of Princeton: in the Science window in the nave's south wall.Stillwell, p. 95. *James Madison, a 1771 graduate of Princeton and its first graduate student: in the Law window in the nave's south wall.Stillwell, p. 94. *Adlai Stevenson II, a 1922 graduate of Princeton: in a dedicated stained glass window near the vestry. *John Witherspoon, Princeton's sixth president: in the Great South Window, among the Christian teachers. Current use The chapel operates within university's Office of Religious Life. It is overseen by the Dean of the Chapel. The current Dean of the Chapel is Alison Boden, who is also Dean of Religious Life at Princeton. The Office of Religious Life calls the chapel \\"the home of regular religious services for many of the university's faith groups, including the 264-year-old ecumenical Christian worshiping community [...] that founded Princeton in 1746.\\" Though the university was once closely associated with the Presbyterian Church, it has never been affiliated with any religious denomination. The original trustees \\"were acting in behalf of the evangelical or New Light wing of the Presbyterian Church, but the College had no legal or constitutional identification with that denomination. Its doors were to be open to all students, 'any different sentiments in religion notwithstanding.'\\" In keeping with this tradition, the chapel hosts ecumenical Christian services each Sunday. Catholic Mass is celebrated daily, Reconciliation is offered several days a week, and there is Eucharistic Adoration twice weekly. The chapel also hosts several annual special events. *Opening Exercises: The ceremony marking the beginning of the university's academic year has been held in the chapel since 1929. *Service of Remembrance: On Alumni Day, the chapel hosts a service remembering members of the Princeton University community who died during the preceding calendar year. *Westminster Choir College: The nearby conservatory holds many major performances and ceremonies each year in the chapel. These events include the annual Evening of Readings and Carols in December and the Westminster commencement ceremonies in May. *Baccalaureate: Princeton University's graduating senior class attends an interfaith baccalaureate service in the chapel on the Sunday prior to Commencement. The Princeton University Chapel Choir rehearses, provides music for the weekly service, and performs occasional concerts in the chapel. Relative size The Office of Religious Life calls the chapel the third- largest university chapel in the world. According to Milliner, Princeton's is the second-tallest by height of the nave at the crossing; the tallest is King's College Chapel at the University of Cambridge. The belltower of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart at the University of Notre Dame, the tower of the Duke University Chapel, the tower of the University of Chicago's Rockefeller Chapel, and the campanile of Valparaiso University's Chapel of the Resurrection are all taller than Princeton's chapel, which does not have a tower or other appendages.Milliner, \\"The Princeton University Chapel\\", endnote 13.

The Honourable Reginald Brabazon was born into an old Anglo-Irish family in London, the second son of William Brabazon, 11th Earl of Meath and Harriot Brooke. When his father succeeded to the Earldom in 1851, Reginald, now the heir (his elder brother, Jacques, died of diphtheria in 1844), was styled Lord Brabazon. He was educated at Eton College and in 1863 joined the Foreign Office as a clerk, and later became a diplomat. In 1868 he married Lady Mary Jane Maitland, daughter of the 11th Earl of Lauderdale. On the insistence of his in-laws, Brabazon refused to accept a posting to Athens (which they considered too remote) in 1873 and was effectively suspended without pay, finally resigning from the Diplomatic Service in 1877. He and his wife decided to devote their considerable energies to \\"the consideration of social problems and the relief of human suffering\\". Both were subsequently involved in many charitable organisations. The Earl and his wife leased Ottershaw Park from 1882 to November 1883 from Sir Edward Colebrooke.Website on Ottershaw Park In May 1887, Brabazon succeeded his father as 12th Earl of Meath. Lord Meath was also a prominent Conservative politician in the House of Lords as Baron Chaworth, and an ardent imperialist, and was responsible for the introduction in England of Empire Day, which was officially recognised by the British Government in 1916. He was a member of the London County Council, the Privy Council of Ireland and the Senate of Southern Ireland. He was also Chief Scout Commissioner for Ireland. Lord Meath was appointed Knight of the Order of St Patrick (KP) in 1902, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the 1920 civilian war honours, and Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) in the 1923 Birthday Honours. His younger daughter, Lady Violet Constance Maitland Brabazon (1886‚Äì1936), married the 4th Earl of Verulam.

Geography Bad Bleiberg is situated west of the district's capital Villach in a high valley on the northern slope of the Dobratsch (Villacher Alpe) massif, the easternmost part of the Gailtal Alps mountain range. The municipal area comprises the cadastral communities of Bleiberg proper and Kreuth. History King Henry II of Germany granted the Carinthian lands around Villach to the newly created Diocese of Bamberg at the Frankfurt synod of 1 November 1007, together with other estates like Griffen or the Canal Valley around Tarvisio. When under Emperor Frederick II Bamberg was elevated to a Prince-Bishopric, the territories became ecclesiastical exclaves within the territory of the Carinthian dukes. In 1759 the Bamberg estates were finally acquired by Empress Maria Theresa and incorporated into Habsburg Carinthia. Bad Bleiberg with Dobratsch massif, 1908 postcard The mine was first mentioned as Pleyberg in a 1333 deed issued by the Bamberg bishops; it was operated by the Swabian Fugger family from the late 15th century onwards. Georgius Agricola described the mining and smelting of lead and zinc in his 1556 book De re metallica. Mining operations ceased in 1993 for economic reasons, today a tourist mine offers guided underground tours. The current municipality was established in 1850, it received the status of a market town in 1930.

The Great Recession slowed the construction boom. The International Herald Tribune has described it as \\"planned free- market capitalism.\\" Oil production, which once accounted for 50 percent of Dubai's gross domestic product, contributes less than 1 percent to GDP today. Dubai became important ports of call for Western manufacturers. Most of the new city's banking and financial centres were headquartered in the port area. Dubai maintained its importance as a trade route through the 1970s and 1980s. The city of Dubai has a free trade in gold and until the 1990s was the hub of a \\"brisk smuggling trade\\" of gold ingots to India, where gold import was restricted. Today, Dubai has focused its economy on tourism by building hotels and developing real estate. Port Jebel Ali, constructed in the 1970s, has the largest man-made harbor in the world, but is also increasingly developing as a hub for service industries such as IT and finance, with the new Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). Emirates Airline was founded by the government in 1985 and is still state-owned; based at Dubai International Airport, it carried over 49.7 million passengers in 2015. According to Healy Consultants, Dubai is the top business gateway for the Middle East and Africa. The government has set up industry-specific free zones throughout the city in hopes of giving a boost to Dubai property. Dubai Internet City, now combined with Dubai Media City as part of TECOM (Dubai Technology, Electronic Commerce and Media Free Zone Authority) is one such enclave whose members include IT firms such as EMC Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Microsoft, Sage Software and IBM, and media organisations such as MBC, CNN, Reuters and AP. Dubai Knowledge Village (KV), an education and training hub, is also set up to complement the Free Zone's other two clusters, Dubai Internet City and Dubai Media City, by providing the facilities to train the clusters' future knowledge workers. Dubai Outsourcing Zone is for companies who are involved in outsourcing activities can set up their offices with concessions provided by Dubai Government. Internet access is restricted in most areas of Dubai with a proxy server filtering out sites deemed to be against cultural and religious values of the UAE. Real estate and property The government's decision to diversify from a trade-based but oil-reliant economy to one that is service- and tourism-oriented resulted in the property boom from 2004 to 2008. Construction on a large scale has turned Dubai into one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. The property boom is largely driven by megaprojects such as the off-shore Palm Islands and The World, and the inland Dubai Marina, Burj Khalifa complex, Dubai Waterfront, Business Bay, Dubailand and Jumeirah Village. The Palm Jumeirah, the world's largest man-made island. Dubai is home to skyscrapers such as Emirates Towers, which are the 12th and 24th tallest buildings in the world, and the Burj-al-Arab hotel, located on its own artificial island and currently the world's fifth tallest and most expensive hotel. Emaar Properties constructed world's current tallest structure, the Burj Khalifa. The height of the skyscraper is 828 m (2,717 ft) tall, with 160 floors. Adjacent to Burj Khalifa is the Dubai Mall, which at the time of construction was the world's largest shopping mall. Also under construction is what is planned to become Dubai's new central business district, named Business Bay. The project, when completed, will feature 500 skyscrapers built around an artificial extension of the existing Dubai Creek. In February 2005, the construction of Dubai Waterfront was announced, it will be 2¬Ω times the size of Washington, D.C., roughly seven times the size of the island of Manhattan. Dubai Waterfront will be a mix of canals and islands full of hotels and residential areas that will add of man-made waterfront. It will also contain Al Burj, another one of the tallest buildings in the world. Dubai has also launched Dubai Science Park (previously DuBiotech and merged with EnPark). This is a new business park to be targeted at biotechnology companies working in pharmaceuticals, medical fields, genetic research and biodefense. One of Dubai's plans in 2006 was for a 30-story, 200 apartment skyscraper that will slowly rotate at its base, making a 360-degree revolution once a week. The world's first rotating skyscraper was to be in the center of the Dubailand complex. There are over 300 stores in the Gold Souk. The International Media Production Zone is a project targeted at creating a hub for printers, publishers, media production companies, and related industry segments. Launched in 2003, the project was scheduled to be completed in 2006. In May 2006 the Bawadi was announced, with a planned 27 billion US-dollar investment intended to increase Dubai's number of hotel rooms by 29,000, doubling it from the current figure offers now. The largest complex was to be called \\"Asia, Asia\\" and was planned to be the largest hotel in the world with more than 6,500 rooms. The first villa freehold properties that were occupied by non-UAE nationals were The Meadows, The Springs, and The Lakes (high-end neighbourhoods designed by Emaar Properties, collectively called Emirates Hills). Expatriates of various nationalities brought capital into Dubai in the early 2000s. Iranian expatriates were estimated to have invested up to $200 billion in Dubai.\\"Import Bill From Dubai $28.7b\\" , Iran Daily, 4 April 2006 From 2005 to 2009, trade between Dubai and Iran tripled to $12 billion. Dubai nationals have also purchased real estate in New York City and London. Purchases in 2005 included New York's 230 Park Avenue (formerly known as the New York Central Building or the Helmsley Building) and Essex House on Central Park South. The Dubai property boom of the mid-2000s peaked in 2008 and plummeted in a wave of activity which saw large scale projects, including partially completed properties, abandoned. Many developers failed, while others, including those with government backing, entered into debt- restructuring deals with their lenders. By 2012 the market began picking up steam again. 2013 was a stellar year with prices accelerating significantly, however the government and industry players began putting in place measures that would safeguard against another bubble developing. One notable difference is the number of cash buyers compared to those in previous years that borrowed heavily. Part of the reason for the current cash surge is the influx of investment from troubled countries.\\"Gulf cash replaces debt to fuel new Dubai property boom\\" , Reuters, 9 October 2013 In September 2013, the Dubai Land Department increased property transfer fees from 2 to 4%.Developers Work Overtime As Government Increases Transfer Fee to 4% In early 2014 the government regulator imposed restrictions on outside-companies acquiring real estate in the emirate, insisting such companies had to have a presence in Dubai, and had to be owned by a natural person or persons, and not by another company. The measures were largely seen as a means to dampen speculation in property prices.\\"Dubai tightens laws on companies acquiring real estate\\", Dubai News.Net, 16 February 2014 Major real estate companies in Dubai actively attract new investors from abroad, concluding partnerships with real estate portals and investment foundations. In 2018, Ellington Properties signed a partnership with Beike, one of the major China's real estate listings portals. As per the agreement, Beike \\"will build awareness of Ellingtons premium Dubai real estate offering to Chinese investors\\"‚ÄúKhaleej Times:\\"Ellington, Beike to promote Dubai to overseas investors\\"‚Äù In July 2019, more than 500 people lost their jobs following an economic downfall observed in the second quarter of 2019, following which Jumeirah Group LLC implemented job cuts. Dubai's economy weighs in on its tourism sector. Hotel occupancy fell to 67% in the second quarter of 2019, the lowest second quarter occupancy since 2009. JLL predicted at the time that \\"further declines in performance are expected over the next 12 months, before the hotel market recovers on the back of strong visitor arrivals growth associated with Expo 2020.\\" As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, real estate prices and overall demand for property dropped in 2020. Cavendish Maxwell, a realty consultancy, found that apartment prices in Dubai fell 12% from Q1 2019 to Q1 2020. In contrast, the estate agent firm Chestertons saw the rental market perform better, with an average decrease of only 1.5% in apartment rental prices in Q1 2020. Construction Since 2000, Dubai's municipality has initiated construction phases in the city, predominantly in the Mina Seyahi area, located further from Jumeirah, towards Jebel Ali.\\"Jebel Ali Free Zone\\" , Business-Dubai.com, retrieved 20 November 2015 This has come at a cost however. Dubai ( and UAE ) construction companies employ low-wage labourers from Asia for up to 12 hours a day, six or seven days a week. These workers often have their passports withheld and are threatened if they speak to media. During the 1990s and 2000s, many workers staged protests and those who were expats were deported. In 2002 a change was made to the law allowing non-nationals of the UAE to own property (not land) in Dubai as fee simple, and 99-year leases are sold to people with ownership remaining with private companies. Property companies include Nakheel Properties, Emaar Properties and Ellington Properties. Rent rises were capped at 7% per annum up to 2007 under a directive from Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Legislation in this area is still developing as the property market for foreigners is relatively new. Property prices in Dubai have experienced a downfall since 2014. A difference of more than 25 per cent has been noted. More than two-year ago Dubai's Creek Tower construction started, but no completion date is in sight yet. A cutback on the construction project has come into the scene since, followed by realty developers postponing supplier payments. Consultancy firms like JLL cite the falling property prices to continue in 2019. Despite the economic slump and a relatively slower growth expectation, the estimated cost of Expo 2020 construction has reached AED38 billion ($10.3 billion). Diamonds Dubai has become the world's third largest diamond trading hub, with trade of rough and cut diamonds increasing since 2001. The emirate's diamond trade was virtually nonexistent at the beginning of the 2000s, but was worth nearly $35 billion in 2013 and 2014. The emirate has been able to leverage off its geographical position between major supplies of mined diamonds in Africa, to the main cutting centres in India and further east in China. There is also a perception of Dubai as a buying hub for consumers of diamonds jewellery, due to the large number of jewellers in the emirate and the tax-free business regime. The diamond trading takes on an exchange managed by the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre, with many of the industry participants housed in office space in the Almas Tower in the JLT business cluster. Facilities there include Kimberley Process Certification offices and access to secure transportation agencies such as Brinks and Transguard, in addition to networking and meeting rooms. Gold Trade in gold grew during the 1940s due to Dubai's free trade policies that encouraged entrepreneurs from India and Iran to set up stores in the Dubai Gold Souk. Despite a general slump in the global gold market, Dubai's share of value of trade in gold and diamonds to its total non-oil direct trade increased from 18% in 2003, to 24% in 2004. In 2003, the value of trade in gold in Dubai was approximately Dh. 21 billion (US$5.8 billion), while trade in diamonds was approximately Dh. 25 billion (US$7 billion) in 2005. India is Dubai's largest buyer of gold, accounting for approximately 23% of the emirate's total gold trade in 2005. Switzerland was Dubai's largest supplier of gold ingots, wastes and scrap. Similarly, India accounted for approximately 68% of all diamond- related trade in Dubai; Belgium's share in Dubai's diamond trade was about 13% (2005). A June 2019 report by The Wall Street Journal reported, the government of Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro sold 7.4 tons of gold ingots, worth $300 million through illicit channels to evade US sanctions. In March 2019, the bullions passed through African Gold Refinery (AGR) in Uganda, and were later exported to Dubai.  Industry and manufacturing  Dubai is also home to some significant industrial ventures in energy production through DEWA, although this is primarily water and power production for Dubai. In the aluminium industry Emirates Global Alumninium produces 2.4 million tonnes of aluminium per year (~$3.8B USD in revenue). Investments were made in car manufacturing with Zarooq Motors; the start of UAE car industry. Production and sales were due to begin in 2016 but seem to have run into some trouble insofar as no cars have actually been manufactured. Dubai Ports is also an example of industrialization in Dubai.

The Crusade was famously associated with Panait Istrati, world-renowned novelist and dissident communist, who added into the mix of \\"Romanianism\\" some elements of libertarian socialism. The Stelists oscillated between maverick independence and electoral alliances with more prestigious nationalist parties. The Crusade was a minor party, whose decision of publicly settling scores with the Iron Guard proved fatal. In the summer of 1936, Stelescu was murdered by an Iron Guard death squad, and his party only survived for one more year. Its caretakers during that final period were journalist Alexandru Talex and General Nicolae RƒÉdescu. History=Beginnings Iron Guard rally, 1933. Codreanu is front row, right, with Stelescu by his side Originally named \\"The White Eagles\\",Gheran, p. 439 the Crusade emerged in early 1935, as a splinter group from the Iron Guard. Stelescu's break with Codreanu was sudden and public. In 1932, Stelescu was a prominent Guard politico, tasked with political campaigning in Bucharest and the youngest Romanian Parliament member.Veiga, pp. 159, 228, 241 As documented by visitors Jean and J√©r√¥me Tharaud, Stelescu eclipsed his political boss in matters of oratory and political competence.Heinen, p. 253; Veiga, p. 241 As a consequence of this, Codreanu began handing him risky assignments, implicating him in the assassination of Premier Ion G. Duca (for which Stelescu served a term in prison).Heinen, pp. 253, 446 It is also likely that Stelescu was infuriated by Codreanu's refusal to tackle the political establishment head on: in 1934, the Guard was keeping a low profile, content with mildly criticizing the authoritarian King of Romania, Carol II.Ornea, pp. 306‚Äì307; Veiga, pp. 228‚Äì230, 241 When, in September 1934, Stelescu went public with his first denunciations of Codrenist tactics, he was promptly excluded from the Guard. The decision had a vague disclaimer: Stelescu could be welcomed back into the Guard on condition that he perform an exceptional act of self-sacrifice.Ornea (1995), p. 306 According to later Codrenist mythology, Stelescu had in fact been exposed as the would-be assassin of Codreanu.Clark, p. 122; Heinen, pp. 253, 277; Veiga, p. 241 For his part, Stelescu alleged that, by hinting at reconciliation, Codreanu had discreetly urged him to poison another one of the Iron Guard's adversaries: Foreign Minister Nicolae Titulescu.\\"Iron Guard Accused of Plotting Titulescu's Death\\", in the Jewish Telegraphic Agency News, Nr. 213/1937 Stelescu left together with some other high-ranking activists of Codreanu's movement, who helped him establish the \\"White Eagles\\" party, and possibly convinced all of the Guard's youth sections in Bucharest to join them.Veiga, pp. 229, 241 Historian Franklin L. Ford sees the schism as important, arguing that Stelescu effectively took control of the \\"Cross Brotherhood\\" network, which he had helped recruit for the Guard in the late 1920s.Ford, p. 268 Citing the Guard's supposed elitism, Stelescu hoped to rely on support from more populist Guardsmen, including Ion Mo»õa and Gheorghe Clime.Heinen, p. 253. See also Clark, p. 122 Reportedly, the splinter group soon found support among figures of the Carol regime, who financed it as a way of drawing away support from the Guard.Clark, p. 122 On November 22, 1934,Ileana-Stanca Desa, Elena Ioana MƒÉlu»ôanu, Cornelia Lumini»õa Radu, Iliana SulicƒÉ, Publica»õiile periodice rom√¢ne»ôti (ziare, gazete, reviste).

Ornea, \\"Cum a devenit Istrati scriitor\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 22/1999 Stelescu established his eponymous weekly newspaper, Cruciada Rom√¢nismului, with Alexandru Talex as editor and himself as director. Talex, who was politically independent, had been university colleagues with Stelescu. He was moved by Stelescu's marginalization, but, as he recalled in a later interview, personally disliked him. Mugur Popovici, \\" 'Panait Istrati m-a ajutat sƒÉ rƒÉm√¢n om √Æntr-o lume de lupi' \\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 48/2009 Talex and Stelescu were allegedly supplied with funds by Prince Constantin Karadja, who also contributed to the paper. Another important figure was Gheorghe Beza, an Aromanian dissident of the Iron Guard, famous for his earlier involvement in political conspiracies.Heinen, pp. 183‚Äì184, 187, 278, 477 Other men involved with Stelescu's newspaper, and probably his movement, were journalists Sergiu Lecca, Dem. Bassarabeanu and Mircea Mateescu. Victor Durnea, \\"Un avangardist uitat ‚Äì Mihail Dan\\", in Anuar de LingvisticƒÉ »ôi Istorie LiterarƒÉ, Vols.

He was a literary celebrity and long-time socialist, whose public denunciation of the Soviet Union had sparked an international controversy. It is still unclear whether Istrati was ever formally affiliated with the Crusade as a political party. Some authors suggest as much.Clark, p. 122; Ionesco, p. 184; Veiga, p. 229 In April Istrati died from tuberculosis in Bucharest. He had been unable to support himself during his last months, and relied on government handouts‚Äîan appeasement that was much ridiculed from the far left. An independent Trotskyist newspaper, Proletarul, claimed that the Stelists had supervised Istrati's funeral ceremony, driving away his leftist friends.TƒÉnase (2004), p. 53 Under Stelescu Stelescu and other Crusade members at Panait Istrati's funeral, April 1935 The Stelists were intensely courted by other far-right organizations, with which the Guard was competing for the nationalist vote. The Crusade was especially close to the National- Christian Defense League (LANC), from which the Guard had split almost a decade before, and envisaged the creation of a \\"united front\\" against democracy and \\"the radical left\\".\\"Demisia Doctorului Trifu\\", in Cruciada Rom√¢nismului, November 22, 1934, p. 6 In March 1935, a Crusade delegation attended a LANC's national congress. The state monitored such agreements, which also involved the Romanian Front, and reported that the Crusade was in the process of merging with the LANC. Radu Florian Bruja, \\"Din istoria partidului na»õional cre»ôtin √Æn Bucovina (1935-1937)\\", in the Romanian Academy (George Bari»õ Institute of History) Historica Yearbook 2010, p. 83 The LANC merger never took place. In September 1935, the Crusade of Romanianism sealed a pact with the right-wing \\"Georgist\\" Liberals and Grigore For»õu's extremist Citizens' Bloc of National Salvation.Gheorghe I. Florescu, \\"Alexandru Averescu, omul politic (VIII)\\", in Convorbiri Literare, December 2009 This three-pronged alliance aimed at involvement in national politics. The \\"Georgists\\" had also formed a cartel with the People's Party (PP), which had previously been one of the three most powerful parties in Romania. The \\"Georgist\\"-Populist alliance, or \\"Constitutional Front\\", came to include both the Stelists and the Citizen's Bloc. PP leader Alexandru Averescu was working to gather as much support as needed for prompting Carol to hand him power. His plan backfired: on one hand, the Stelists did not necessarily endorse the idea of a new Averescu government; on the other, the PP moderates protested against Averescu's cohabitation with fascist groups. By early 1936, the Constitutional Front still existed, but the PP had effectively withdrawn from it. Meanwhile, the Crusade was preparing to settle scores with the Iron Guard. Its newspapers published detailed reports about the contacts between Codreanu and King Carol, noting that the Guard enjoyed free publicity \\"in the official and semiofficial press\\", and even that government money was being spent on manufacturing Guardist insignia.Eliza Campus, \\"Despre politica externƒÉ antina»õionalƒÉ a guvernelor burghezo-mo»ôiere»ôti din Rom√¢nia, √Æn timpul politicii imperialiste de a»ôa-zisƒÉ 'neinterven»õie' \\", in Studii. RevistƒÉ de Istorie, Nr. 3/1952, p. 51 More disturbingly for Codreanu, Stelescu was publishing information regarding secret contacts between the Guard and the royal mistress, Elena Lupescu,Ornea (1995), pp. 298‚Äì299, 306‚Äì307 as well as statements implicating Codreanu in the Duca assassinationHeinen, p. 277 and questioning his Romanian ethnicity.CƒÉlinescu & Savu, p. 310; Clark, p. 122 Both Stelescu and Beza visited with Armand CƒÉlinescu, the Minister of Internal Affairs, providing him with a full record of the Guard's policy on assassinations.CƒÉlinescu & Savu, pp. 292‚Äì293 Stelescu's assassination and aftermath Stelescu himself already expected to be assassinated by the Codrenists, and repeatedly taunted his adversaries, instructing them to shoot him, but \\"not in the back\\".Ornea (1995), p. 307 In July 1936, while recovering at the Br√¢ncovenesc Hospital, where he had undergone an appendectomy, Stelescu fell victim to the Guard's revenge. A Decemviri death squad, comprising ten Theology students,Veiga, p. 229 had formally received Codreanu's blessing at the Iron Guard Congress in T√¢rgu Mure»ô that April.CƒÉlinescu & Savu, p. 310; Clark, pp. 121, 123, 134; Gheorghe & »òerbu, p. 268; Heinen, pp. 259‚Äì260, 278, 281‚Äì284, 290, 446; Ornea (1995), pp. 204, 307 Seizing its opportunity, it stormed into the hospital building and shot Stelescu to death. This murder left an enduring mark on public memory because of its ritualistic nature: Stelescu's body was not just riddled with bullets, but also bludgeoned or hacked to pieces.CƒÉlinescu & Savu, p. 310; Clark, p. 123; Gheran, p. 440; Heinen, p. 260; Ornea (1995), p. 308; Veiga, p. 229 The orphaned movement still counted among its members some relevant figures in Romanian politics. Nicolae RƒÉdescu, a Romanian Land Forces general, was an affiliate, and, according to some sources, became the Crusade's leader upon Stelescu's murder.V. Liveanu, \\"ParticularitƒÉ»õi ale strategiei politice a Partidului Comunist Rom√¢n √Æn revolu»õia popularƒÉ. RevendicƒÉrile imediate »ôi obiectivul final\\", in Studii. RevistƒÉ de Istorie, Nr. 3/1971, p. 584 He was in any case the decision-maker, and probably contributed to the movement's financing.Mitchievici, p. 94 Previously registered with Averescu's PP, RƒÉdescu was a stated enemy of the political establishment. In 1933, upon presenting his resignation from the army, he had accused \\"profiteering politicians\\" and the king's \\"camarilla\\" of commercializing military life.Gheorghe & »òerbu, p. 303 Other Crusade members were harmed by Codrenist attacks, and, within the Iron Guard, \\"Stelism\\" became a crime punishable by death.Clark, p. 123; Heinen, pp. 260, 278, 283‚Äì284, 291, 483 Nevertheless, Codreanu feared retaliation, and surrounded himself with body guards.Clark, p. 123 Cruciada Rom√¢nismului newspaper was in print until 1937, by which time some of its members had embraced other causes. Moving on from the Crusade, Sergiu Lecca was involved in arranging contacts between the mainstream National Peasants' Party (PN»ö) and communist cells.Stelian TƒÉnase, \\"N.D. Cocea, un boier amoral/N.D. Cocea, an Immoral Boyar\\" (I), in Sfera Politicii, Nr. 136/2009, p. 56 Beza was also accepted into the PN»ö,Veiga, pp. 14, 207 founding the anti-fascist Peasant Guards as its paramilitary section. Silvia Iliescu, \\"O lai Beza, o lai frate...\\", Agen»õia de presƒÉ RADOR release, February 2, 2016 At least one other Stelist had registered with the Social Democratic Party by 1946.Melania »öƒÉrƒÉu, \\"Procesul de desfiin»õare a Partidului social-democrat.

Mircea Mateescu, \\"Organizarea haosului rom√¢nesc\\", in Universul Literar, Nr. 39/1940, pp. 1, 6 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) In March 1937, the Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu government clamped down on all paramilitary movements, banning political uniforms, including the Guard's green shirts and the Crusade's carmine shirts.Clark, pp. 184‚Äì185 The group dissolved itself, but RƒÉdescu remained politically active into World War II, and was listed as one of King Carol's more potent enemies. He survived the \\"National Legionary\\" episode of Iron Guard rule, when he was reportedly marginalized as a \\"Freemason\\". According to one testimony, the general was never forgiven by the Guard for having supported Stelescu. During the putsch of January 1941, Iron Guard assassin squads were on the lookout for RƒÉdescu, who went into hiding. Alexandru »òerbƒÉnescu, \\"Nicolae RƒÉdescu 6 martie 1945\\", in Memoria. Revista G√¢ndirii Arestate, Nr. 50 Some former Crusade members were already working at undermining Romania's involvement with the Axis Powers. From 1940, Beza took to the underground, redesigning the Peasant Guards as a \\"Free Romanian Movement\\"; tried for sedition, he was forced into exile. When, under the Ion Antonescu regime, Romanian troops occupied Transnistria, RƒÉdescu issued a formal protest and spent a full year in the concentration camp. From his diplomatic post, Prince Karadja extended protection to Jews fleeing the Holocaust, coming into conflict with the SS.Tra»ôcƒÉ & Obiziuc, passim Meanwhile, Sergiu Lecca, who was the brother of Antonescu aide Radu Lecca, took part in informal negotiations between Romania and the Allied Powers.Dan Amedeo LƒÉzƒÉrescu, Andrei Goldner, \\"Op»õiuni √Æn politica externƒÉ\\", in Ion Solacolu (ed.), Tragedia Rom√¢niei: 1939‚Äì1947. Institutul Na»õional pentru Memoria Exilului Rom√¢nesc: Restituiri I, Editura Pro Historia, Bucharest, 2004, pp. 69‚Äì70. Final echoes Although still an anticommunist, RƒÉdescu was brought to high office by the Soviet occupation of Romania, and, from December 1944, served as Prime Minister. He refused to sanction Soviet abuse of power and clashed with the Romanian Communist Party, while pursuing war against Nazi Germany. Neagu Djuvara, \\"ReplicƒÉ. Din nou despre exilul rom√¢nesc\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 140, October 2002Gheorghe & »òerbu, pp. 303‚Äì304 Additionally, RƒÉdescu was also at war with the Iron Guard puppet government that was set up behind enemy lines, but it is still debated whether or not he actually protected those Guardsmen who did not defect to the Germans. The toppling of RƒÉdescu's cabinet in February 1945 was a new step toward the communization of Romania.Gheorghe & »òerbu, pp. 304‚Äì305 Indicted as a crypto-fascist by the communist authorities, he escaped to New York City, where he helped form the Romanian National Committee (RNC).Gheorghe & »òerbu, pp. 305, 307 He was endorsed by PN»ö-ist diaspora cells, but favored a rapprochement with the Iron Guard as the basis for continued armed resistance. This issue created a rift between the RNC and the Union of Romanian Jews, represented in exile by Wilhelm Filderman.Elizabeth Hazard, \\"RƒÉzboiul Rece a √Ænceput √Æn Rom√¢nia\\", in Magazin Istoric, August 1996, pp. 55‚Äì58 The surviving membership of the Crusade was also hunted down by the Romanian communist republic. According to aviator Ion Co»ôoveanu, who was for long a political prisoner, Stelists were a distinct faction among the anticommunist underground. Co»ôoveanu (quoted by writer Niculae Gheran) recalled that, once in prison, Crusade members used to bicker with Iron Guard rivals. Co»ôoveanu also notes that the Stelist faction accepted into its ranks the poet Radu Gyr, until discovering that he was informing on them for the Guardists.Gheran, pp. 439‚Äì440 Talex himself was not touched by communist persecutions and was perceived by the authorities as a fellow traveler. When Istrati was posthumously rehabilitated in the 1970s, Talex worked on publishing his manuscripts and his correspondence.Mitchievici, pp. 88‚Äì89, 94 As argued by cultural historian Zigu Ornea, Talex's work in this field makes a point of obfuscating Istrati's contribution to the Crusade, as well as Talex's own. This contrasted with the treatment of other former Crusade people: Dem. Bassarabeanu's poetry was stricken from public memory by communist censorship, due to the author's fascist beliefs. Andrei Moldovan, \\"Din coresponden»õa lui Liviu Rebreanu\\" , in Vatra, Nr. 11/2011, p. 58 Another poet, Mihu Dragomir, albeit formally aligned with communist ideology, was investigated for a supposed teenage involvement with the Crusade. Paul Cernat, \\"Anii '50 »ôi T√ÆnƒÉrul Scriitor\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 285, August 2005 Ideology=\\"Confusing the extremes\\" Political historian Stanley G. Payne describes the Crusade as distinct among the Romanian fascist groups: \\"a tiny organization which sought to target workers and to inspire socioeconomic transformation.\\"Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism 1914‚Äì45, Routledge, London, 1995, p. 284. Within the party, there was always a degree of assimilation between fascist trappings and far-left causes, indicative of Stelescu's indecision. In his first-ever editorial column, Stelescu derided all political uniforms, and implicitly all political extremes, stating: \\"one can believe in something without donning a colored shirt, just as one can wear a colored shirt without believing in anything.\\" He demanded a \\"united front\\" of \\"fearless warriors\\", entirely cut off from all preexisting ideologies.Mihai Stelescu, \\"Prefa»õƒÉ\\", in Cruciada Rom√¢nismului, November 22, 1934, p. 1 Nevertheless, Stelescu had personally selected green-colored shirts as the Iron Guard uniform, before his own movement settled on carmine.Clark, pp. 184, 185 In March 1935 Eug√®ne Ionesco, the left-leaning literary columnist, noted that Stelescu's newspaper made a habit of \\"confusing the extremes\\". Ionesco was referring to Cruciada Rom√¢nismuluis appreciation for the socialist poetry of Liviu Bratoloveanu.Ionesco, pp. 183‚Äì184 The appropriation of leftist ideas was especially apparent after the Crusade's involvement in the international Istrati scandal. When he first publicized his pact with Stelescu, Istrati specified an \\"absolute requirement that the Crusade keep itself equally distant from fascism, communism and the antisemitism of hooligans.\\" Teodor V√¢rgolici, \\"Publicistica lui Panait Istrati\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 14/2007 In one of his letters, where he paraphrases the Stelist program, Istrati reaffirms this principle, while also noting: \\"Ours is a national movement for economic change, for civic education and for social combat. We are against capitalism, oppression and violence.\\"Mermoz & Talex, p. 292 The group was entirely against the parliamentary system, but harbored two distinct currents when it came to supplanting it. Stelescu himself wrote that \\"democracy sickens us\\", since it had resulted in inept governance \\"by a mass of nitwits\\".Ornea (1995), pp. 59‚Äì60 The movement viewed liberalism and human rights with suspicion rather than hostility, since they left the door open for \\"capitalism and politicking\\".Const. Barcaroiu, \\"Incertitudinea muncii\\", in Cruciada Rom√¢nismului, November 22, 1934, p. 7 Istrati had dissenting views. In its Christmas 1934 issue, Cruciada Rom√¢nismului published his \\"Letter to... the Right\\", which called democracy \\"putrid\\" but described dictatorship as an unsound regime: \\"Dictatorship, of whatever kind, signals that the social organism has grown old. It is the system that will suppress in its adversary all his fighting means, to take them over for its own use, like an old man who ties up a robust youth and then proceeds to beat him up at his own convenience.\\"\\"Revista revistelor. Cruciada Rom√¢nismului\\", in Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, Nr. 2/1935, pp. 476‚Äì477 Beyond its anticapitalism, the Crusade had as its main characteristic a strong connection with Italian fascism, as opposed to Nazism. Historian Francisco Veiga describes this as being a necessary repositioning against \\"Codreanu's Germanophilia\\"‚Äîwhen Nazi Germany and Italy where still competing with each other in Southeastern Europe. Other historians also stress the Crusade's anti-Nazism. F. L. Ford also writes that Stelescu's \\"dramatic forecasts\\" are notable protests against the Guard's Nazification.Ford, pp. 268‚Äì269 Armin Heinen paraphrases Stelescu's message: \\"he feared [Germany] would impose upon Romania the status of a colony.\\"Heinen, p. 253 Also according to Heinen, Codreanu's celebration of Nazism as an international phenomenon had turned Stelescu's attention toward the Benito Mussolini alternative.Heinen, p. 300 Istrati's \\"spiritual movement\\" As Talex recalls, Istrati was bothered by Stelescu's homages to Mussolini, and, on one occasion, threatened to withdraw from the common enterprise. His own political preferences were veering toward libertarian socialism and anarchism.Mermoz & Talex, pp. 282, 283, 299‚Äì300; Mitchievici, pp. 82‚Äì83, 88‚Äì89; Roux, pp. 95‚Äì96, 101‚Äì104 Inspired by Gandhism, the \\"Letter to... the Right\\" advised against all forms of political violence. Liviu Borda≈ü, \\"Istrati, Rolland »ôi reprezentan»õii 'Rena»ôterii indiene' \\", in Idei √Æn Dialog, Nr. 8/2005 Istrati saw the Crusade as \\"rather a spiritual movement\\". According to Ornea, this was a naive assessment, and evidenced the degree to which Istrati was being \\"manipulated\\" by Talex. For Istrati's adversaries on the left, the Crusade involvement was proof that Istrati was a covert fascist. The allegations were publicized by two of Istrati's former colleagues in international communism, Henri Barbusse and Francis Jourdain.Mermoz & Talex, pp. 284‚Äì285, 289, 291, 301‚Äì302, 305; Roux, p. 103; TƒÉnase (2004), p. 56 According to such sources, Istrati's \\"mercenary literature\\" and his contributions to a \\"fascist newspaper\\" earned him some 50,000‚Ç£, paid for by big oil. Cayetano C√≥rdova Iturburu, \\"Panait Istrati\\", in Nueva Revista. Pol√≠tica, Arte, Econom√≠a, N¬∫ 4/1935, p. 3 Overall, Trotskyist commentators were more lenient, writing off Istrati's inconsistencies as a sign of his perennial nervous instability. Istrati made a point of responding in Stelescu's paper, under the headline \\"The Objectivity of the 'Independent' Communist Press\\" (March 21, 1935).Mermoz & Talex, p. 289 He was publicly defended by his friend, the anti-Soviet leftist Victor Serge, who described Istrati's last combat in verse: { width=\\"100%\\"  You lay upon your press clippings, like Job upon his ashes quietly spitting the last bits of your lungs, in the faces of those copy-pissers\\"The Death of Pana√Øt Istrati\\", translation by James Brook, in Richard Greeman, \\"Introduction\\" to Victor Serge, Resistance, City Lights Books, San Francisco, 1989, p. V.  } However, Istrati's connection with the Crusade was not his only contact with right-wing radicalism: he had also promised to have his political testament printed in Gringoire, a newspaper of the French far-right.Mitchievici, pp. 86, 94 Against Talex's disclaimers, several later exegetes have reanimated the debate about Istrati's possible fascist leanings. Historian Jean-Michel Palmier includes Istrati's name on a list of \\"intellectuals [who] saw for a moment in fascism the possibility of arousing a crisis-struck Europe from its lethargy.\\" He is in the company of Knut Hamsun, Ezra Pound and Wyndham Lewis.Jean-Michel Palmier, Weimar in Exile: The Antifascist Emigration in Europe and America, Verso Books, London & New York City, 2006, pp. 49‚Äì50. Philologist Tudorel Urian asks: \\"Who really is Istrati: the frantic socialist he was before his visit to the USSR [...] or the nationalist of his very last months, the emblem of a Guardist periodical? There is something that those who judge him rarely take into account: in the periods when he flirted with socialism [...] and Guardism, both movements where in their romantic, idealistic stages. Once he came face to face with the brutal realities of the Soviet regime, Istrati broke with socialism and perhaps his famous motto, je ne marche pas ['no, I won't bite'] would have come into play in relation with the Guardists, should he have lived to see their earliest crimes.\\" Tudorel Urian, \\"Cine a fost Panait Istrati?\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 10/2004 According to literary historian Angelo Mitchievici, \\"Interestingly, [the Crusade] had stated its dissidence and a distinct position within the Iron Guard movement. Perhaps it was the group's marginal, dissident status that appealed to Istrati. [...] Even if, in this very context, Panait Istrati endures as a freelancer, he could not have evaded the abusive assimilation into a direction that did not truly reflect his affinities.\\" On antisemitism and Christianity The Istrati scandal touches another controversial aspect of Stelist policies: their Iron Guard-inherited antisemitism. Stelescu sent the message in November 1934, when he criticized ethnic minorities for monopolizing the job market: \\"Factory positions for Romanian workers, our own kind first and if anything is left we would gladly share it with the foreigner, if he is indeed in need of.\\"Mihai Stelescu, \\"»òomajul\\", in Cruciada Rom√¢nismului, November 22, 1934, p. 3 According to Veiga, Istrati \\"toned down the antisemitism of Stelescu and his followers, but the [Stelist] Movement continued to be a far-right one.\\" Also, \\"the disillusionment he felt toward Soviet communism did not manage to make Istrati into a fascist; quite the contrary, he was the one to influence Stelescu, making him renounce, for instance, his antisemitism.\\"Veiga, p. 241 Among the Crusade men, Prince Karadja witnessed first-hand the application of antisemitic terror in 1930s Germany, and was already taking measures to protect the Jewish Romanian expatriates.Tra≈ücƒÉ & Obiziuc, pp. 110‚Äì113 In his papers of 1935, Istrati presents himself exclusively as an enemy of \\"the Jewish bourgeoisie\\", a class he describes as \\"corrupt, pseudo-humanitarian, pseudo-democratic\\" and accuses of stirring up scandal. Istrati's articles in Cruciada Rom√¢nismului are more adamantly philosemitic. One of them, \\"A Letter to Love\\", led to a series of articles on the subject, from Stelescu and other Crusade people. In his own articles, Talex answered for the Stelist movement: \\"Panait Istrati, do you know what it is we need? A fist... The Crusade of Romanianism will attempt to become that fist... Our antisemitism? Just the same as yours: a humane one.

The American Jewish Committee papers describe the Crusade as \\"a Fascist group which did not have anti-Jewish tendencies\\", quoting Stelescu's statement \\"that he was not a Jew-baiter and that, although his party was nationalist, it was inspired by genuine Christian principles.\\"Harry Scheiderman, Review of the Year 5697, p. 440, at the American Jewish Committee Archives; retrieved February 17, 2013 The movement resented the secularization of public affairs, and expressed admiration for Romanian Orthodoxy: \\"And if some church servants have indeed trespassed, faith itself is not to blame.

It was critical of feminism, noting that Christianity itself had liberated women, had given them status and purpose. However, it also asserted that woman was \\"the guardian angel, always in the shadow of man.\\" Feminism, meanwhile, was \\"equality in vice.\\"Icad√©, \\"Cronica femeninƒÉ. Femeia\\", in Cruciada Rom√¢nismului, November 22, 1934, p. 7 The Stelists also accused the Soviet Union and its Romanian sympathizers (for instance the staff of Cuv√¢ntul Liber newspaper) of mounting an international campaign against Christianity. Defining \\"Romanianism\\" When Stelescu founded his \\"White Eagles\\", the right-wing nativists, the centrists and the advocates of left-wing nationalism in Romania had been disputing over the concept of \\"Romanianism\\" for over a decade. The idea of a homegrown ideological current of that name was swiftly embraced by intellectual sympathizers of the Iron Guard, among them Nae Ionescu, Nichifor Crainic, Alexandru Randa, Traian BrƒÉileanu and Mihail Manoilescu.Ornea (1995), pp. 87‚Äì95, 98‚Äì102, 108, 110, 124‚Äì126, 374 An alternative Romanianism, liberal and skeptical toward nationalist rhetoric, was being promoted by the philosophers Constantin RƒÉdulescu-Motru and Mircea Eliade, who demanded the continuous Westernization of Romanian society.Ornea (1995), pp. 119‚Äì129, 134‚Äì137 Before he was won over by fascism, Eliade defined Romanianism as \\"neither fascism nor chauvinism‚Äîrather, the mere desire to realize an organic, unitary, ethnic, balanced state\\".Ornea (1995), pp. 135‚Äì136 The Crusade's version of the concept borrowed from all sides of the debate. In his \\"democracy sickens us\\" essay, Stelescu proposed: \\"Romanianism is the only credo that might invigorate this nation. Solutions for its sons, from its bosom, within its spirit, on its soil\\".Ornea (1995), p. 60 According to Talex, this brand of Romanianism was \\"noble and creative\\", Istrati being its leading exponent. When first introduced to Gandhism and the Ramakrishna Mission in 1930, Istrati himself had declared: \\"To me, the Occident is dead.\\" In 1934, Stelescu's newspaper noted with satisfaction that nationalism was even making its comeback in the Soviet Union. Reading the Soviet press, the Stelists remarked that references to the Comintern and the cause of proletarian internationalism were being discarded, and that Mother Russia was returning in force.\\"Presa de peste grani»õƒÉ\\", in Cruciada Rom√¢nismului, November 22, 1934, p. 6 Talex, who described himself as a \\"know-nothing\\" in political matters, had for a personal idol the nationalist historian Vasile P√¢rvan. He was especially inspired by P√¢rvan's Russophobia, which colored his reading of Istrati's work. His admiration for \\"Romanianism\\" pitted him against the more cosmopolitan liberals of the day, prompting the Crusade's journalistic attacks against Eugen Lovinescu, the doyen of Romanian liberalism. Lovinescu (who had been Talex's high school teacher) was called \\"a con artist\\" in Cruciada Rom√¢nismului.Ornea (1995), pp. 439‚Äì440 NotesReferences *Cruciada Rom√¢nismului, Year I, Issue 1, November 22, 1934 *Armand CƒÉlinescu (contributor: Al.

The term is most often applied to the production or creation of some type of published media.  Overview  Recent advances in technologies (mostly personal computers and the Internet) have enabled private persons to create and publish such media, usually through the Internet. Since the technology now enables new forms of expression and engagement in public discourse, participatory culture not only supports individual creation but also informal relationships that pair novices with experts.Jenkins, Henry, Puroshotma, Ravi, Clinton, Katherine, Weigel, Margaret, & Robison, Alice J. (2005). Confronting the Challenges of Participatory Culture: Media Education for the 21st Century, available at http://www.newmedialiteracies.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/NMLWhitePaper.pdf. Retrieved on 2/4/2013. This new culture as it relates to the Internet has been described as Web 2.0. In participatory culture \\"young people creatively respond to a plethora of electronic signals and cultural commodities in ways that surprise their makers, finding meanings and identities never meant to be there and defying simple nostrums that bewail the manipulation or passivity of \\"consumers.\\" The increasing access to the Internet has come to play an integral part in the expansion of participatory culture because it increasingly enables people to work collaboratively; generate and disseminate news, ideas, and creative works; and connect with people who share similar goals and interests (see affinity groups). The potential of participatory culture for civic engagement and creative expression has been investigated by media scholar Henry Jenkins. In 2006, Jenkins and co-authors Ravi Purushotma, Katie Clinton, Margaret Weigel and Alice Robison authored a white paper entitled Confronting the Challenges of Participatory Culture: Media Education for the 21st Century. This paper describes a participatory culture as one: # With relatively low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement # With strong support for creating and sharing one's creations with others # With some type of informal mentorship whereby what is known by the most experienced is passed along to novices # Where members believe that their contributions matter # Where members feel some degree of social connection with one another (at the least they care what other people think about what they have created).  History  Participatory culture has been around longer than the Internet. The emergence of the Amateur Press Association in the middle of the 19th century is an example of historical participatory culture; at that time, young people were hand typing and printing their own publications. These publications were mailed throughout a network of people and resemble what are now called social networks. The evolution from zines, radio shows, group projects, and gossips to blogs, podcasts, wikis, and social networks has impacted society greatly. With web services such as eBay, Blogger, Wikipedia, Photobucket, Facebook, and YouTube, it is no wonder that culture has become more participatory. The implications of the gradual shift from production to produsage are profound, and will affect the very core of culture, economy, society, and democracy.  Forms  Memes as expression Forms of participatory culture can be manifested in affiliations, expressions, collaborative problem solving, and circulations. Affiliations include both formal and informal memberships in online communities such as discussion boards or social media. Expression refers to the types of media that could be created. This may manifest as memes, fanfiction, or other forms of mash-ups. When individuals and groups work together on a particular form of media or media product, like a wiki, then they engage in collaborative problem solving. Finally, circulation refers to the means through which the communication may be spread. This could include blogs, vlogs, podcasts, and even some forms of social media. Some of the most popular apps that involve participation include: Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Tinder, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Fanfiction creators were one of the first communities to showcase the public could participate in pop culture. Changing, growing, and altering TV shows during their run times. As well as strengthen the series‚Äô popularity after the last episode aired. Some fan fiction creators develop theories and speculation about what will happen next. Other fan fiction authors create ‚Äònew‚Äô material, forming a life of its own outside the confines of the original content. Fans expand on the original story, putting the characters falling in love with in the series through different adventures and sexualities. These communities are composed of audiences and readers from around the world, at different ages, with different backgrounds coming together to develop theories and possibilities about current TV shows, books and films, or expand and continue the stories of TV shows, books, and movies that have come to a close.  Technology  As technology continues to enable new avenues for communication, collaboration, and circulation of ideas, it has also given rise to new opportunities for consumers to create their own content. Barriers like time and money are beginning to become less significant to large groups of consumers. For example, the creation of movies once required large amounts of expensive equipment, but now movie clips can be made with equipment that is affordable to a growing number of people. The ease with which consumers create new material has also grown. Extensive knowledge of computer programming is no longer necessary to create content on the internet. Media sharing over the Internet acts as a platform to invite users to participate and create communities that share similar interests through duplicated sources, original content, and re-purposed material.  Social media  People no longer blindly absorb and consume what large media corporations distribute. Today there are a great deal of people who are consumers who also produce their own content (referring to \\"prosumers\\". The reason participatory culture is a high interest topic is due to the fact that there are just so many different social media platforms to participate and contribute to. These happen to be some of the leaders in the social media industry, and are the reason people are able to have such an advantage to participate in media creation. Today, millions of people across the world have the ability to post, quote, film, or create whatever they want. With the aid of these platforms, the ability to reach a global audience has never been easier.  Social media and politics  Social media have become a huge factor in politics and civics in not just elections but gaining funds, spreading information, getting legislation and petition support, and other political activities. Social media make it easier for the public to make an impact and participate in politics. A study that showed the connection between Facebook messages among friends and how these messages have influenced political expression, voting and information seeking in the 2012 United States presidential election. Social media mobilize people easily and effectively and do the same for the circulation of information. These can-do things in politics like get support for legislation to get passed but social media can also greatly influence elections. The impact social media can have on elections was shown in the 2016 United States presidential election. In the 2016 election 115 pro Trump fake news stories were shared on Facebook 30 million times compared to 41 pro Clinton fake news stories shared 7.6 million times. And 62 percent of United States resident adults get news from social media but most people who see fake news takes the information as true, so many people were basing their votes on false information.  Web 2.0  Not only has hardware increased the individual's ability to submit content to the internet so that it may be reached by a wide audience, but in addition numerous internet sites have increased access. Websites like Flickr, Wikipedia, and Facebook encourage the submission of content to the Internet. They increase the ease with which a user may post content by allowing them to submit information even if they only have an Internet browser. The need for additional software is eliminated. These websites also serve to create online communities for the production of content. These communities and their web services have been labelled as part of Web 2.0. The relationship between Web 2.0 tools and participatory culture is more than just material, however. As the mindsets and skillsets of participatory practices have been increasingly taken up, people are increasingly likely to exploit new tools and technology in 2.0 ways. One example is the use of cellphone technology to engage \\"smart mobs\\" for political change worldwide. In countries where cellphone usage exceeds use of any other form of digital technology, passing information via mobile phone has helped bring about significant political and social change. Notable examples include the so-called \\"Orange Revolution\\" in Ukraine, the overthrow of Philippine President Joseph Estrada,Ellis, Eric. (2001-01-23). Asia Buzz: Revolution. How text messaging toppled Joseph Estrada. Time Asia, http://www.time.com/time/asia/asiabuzz/2001/01/23/. Retrieved on 2009-01-26. and regular political protests worldwideZuckerman, Ethan.

Retrieved on 2009-01-26.  Participatory media  There have been several ways that participatory media allows people to create, connect, and share their content or build friendships throughout the media. YouTube encourages people to create and upload their content to share it around the world, creating an environment for content creators new or old. Discord allows people, primarily gamers, to connect with each other around the world and acts as a live chatroom. Twitch is a streaming media website where content creators can \\"go live\\" for viewers all around the world. A lot of times, these participatory sites have community events such as charity events or memorial streams for someone important to the people in the Twitch community.  Relationship to the smartphone  The smartphone is one example that combines the elements of interactivity, identity, and mobility. The mobility of the smartphone demonstrates that media is no longer bound by time and space can be used in any context. Technology continues to progress in this direction as it becomes more user driven and less restricted to schedules and locations, for example, the progression of movies from theaters to private home viewing, to now the smartphone that can be watched anytime and anywhere. The smartphone also enhances the participatory culture by increased levels of interactivity. Instead of merely watching, users are actively involved in making decisions, navigating pages, contributing their own content and choosing what links to follow. This goes beyond the \\"keyboard\\" level of interactivity, where a person presses a key and the expected letter appears, and becomes rather a dynamic activity with continually new options and changing setting, without a set formula to follow. The consumer role shifts from a passive receiver to an active contributor. The smartphone epitomizes this by the endless choices and ways to get personally involved with multiple media at the same time, in a nonlinear way. The smartphone also contributes to participatory culture because of how it changes the perception of identity. A user can hide behind an avatar, false profile, or simply idealized self when interacting with others online. There is no accountability to be who one says one is. The ability to slide in and out of roles changes the effect of media on culture, and also the user himself. Now not only are people active participants in media and culture, but also their imagined selves.  Producers, consumers, and \\"produsage\\"  In Vincent Miller's Understanding Digital Culture, he makes the argument that the lines between producer and consumers have become blurry. Producers are those that create content and cultural objects, and consumers are the audience or purchasers of those objects. By referring to Axel Bruns' idea of \\"prosumer,\\" Miller argues \\"With the advent of convergent new media and the plethora of choice in sources for information, as well as the increased capacity for individuals to produce content themselves, this shift away from producer hegemony to audience or consumer power would seem to have accelerated, thus eroding the producer-consumer distinction\\" (p. 87). \\"Prosumer\\" is the ending result of a strategy that has been increasingly used which encourages feedback between producers and consumers (prosumers), \\"which allows for more consumer influence over the production of goods.\\" Bruns (2008) refers to produsage, therefore, as a community collaboration that participants can access in order to share \\"content, contributions, and tasks throughout the networked community\\" (p. 14). This is similar to how Wikipedia allows users to write, edit, and ultimately use content. Producers are active participants who are empowered by their participation as network builders. Bruns (2008) describes the empowerment for users as different from the typical \\"top-down mediated spaces of the traditional mediaspheres\\" (p. 14). Produsage occurs when the users are the producers and vice versa, essentially eliminating the need for these \\"top-down\\" interventions. The collaboration of each participant is based on a principle of inclusivity; each member contributes valuable information for another user to use, add to, or change. In a community of learners, collaboration through produsage can provide access to content for every participant, not just those with some kind of authority. Every participant has authority. This leads to Bruns' (2008) idea of \\"equipotentiality: the assumption that while the skills and abilities of all the participants in the produsage project are not equal, they have an equal ability to make a worthy contribution to the project\\" (p. 25). Because there are no more distinctions between producers and consumers, every participant has an equal chance to participate meaningfully in produsage.Reference 3 In July 2020, an academic description reported on the nature and rise of the \\"robot prosumer\\", derived from modern-day technology and related participatory culture, that, in turn, was substantially predicted earlier by science fiction writers.  Explicit and implicit participation  An important contribution has been made by media theorist Mirko Tobias Sch√§fer who distinguishes explicit and implicit participation (2011). Explicit participation describes the conscious and active engagement of users in fan communities or of developers in creative processes. Implicit participation is more subtle and unfolds often without the user's knowledge. In her book, The Culture of Connectivity, Jose Van Dijck emphasizes the importance of recognizing this distinction in order to thoroughly analyze user agency as a techno-cultural construct (2013). Dijck (2013) outlines the various ways in which explicit participation can be conceptualized. The first is the statistical conception of user demographics. Websites may ‚Äúpublish facts and figures about their user intensity (e.g., unique monthly users), their national and global user diversity, and relevant demographic facts‚Äù (p. 33). For instance, Facebook publishes user demographic data such as gender, age, income, education level and more. Explicit participation can also take place on the research end, where an experimental subject interacts with a platform for research purposes. Dijck (2013) references Leon et al. (2011), giving an example of an experimental study where ‚Äúa number of users may be selected to perform tasks so researchers can observe their ability to control privacy settings ‚Äú(p. 33). Lastly, explicit participation may inform ethnographic data through observational studies, or qualitative interview-based research concerning user habits. Implicit participation is achieved by implementing user activities into user interfaces and back-end design. Sch√§fer argues that the success of popular Web 2.0 and social media applications thrives on implicit participation. The notion of implicit participation expands theories of participatory culture as formulated by Henry Jenkins and Axel Bruns who both focus most prominently on explicit participation (p. 44). Considering implicit participation allows therefore for a more accurate analysis of the role technology in co-shaping user interactions and user generated content (pp. 51‚Äì52).  Gendered experiences  Participatory culture lacks representation of the female, which has created a misrepresentation of women online. This in turn, makes it difficult for women to represent themselves with authenticity, and deters participation of females in participatory culture. The content that is viewed on the internet in participatory situations is biased because of the overrepresentation of male generated information, and the ideologies created by the male presence in media, thus creates a submissive role for the female user, as they unconsciously accept patriarchal ideologies as reality. With males in the dominant positions \\"media industries [engage]‚Ä¶ existing technologies to break up and reformulate media texts for reasons of their own\\". Design intent from the male perspective is a main issue deterring accurate female representation. Females active in participatory culture are at a disadvantage because the content they are viewing is not designed with their participation in mind. Instead of producing male biased content, \\"feminist interaction design should seek to bring about political emancipation‚Ä¶ it should also force designers to question their own position to assert what an \\"improved society\\" is and how to achieve it\\". The current interactions and interfaces of participatory culture fails to \\"challenge the hegemonic dominance, legitimacy and appropriateness of positivist epistemologies; theorize from the margins; and problematize gender\\". Men typically are more involved in the technology industry as \\"relatively fewer women work in the industry that designs technology now... only in the areas of HCI/usability is the gender balance of workforce anything like equal\\". Since technology and design is at the crux of the creation of participatory culture \\"much can ‚Äì and should ‚Äì be said about who does what, and it is fair to raise the question of whether an industry of men can design for women\\". \\"Although the members of the group are not directly teaching or perhaps even indicating the object of‚Ä¶ representation, their activities inevitably lead to the exposure of the other individual to that object and this leads to that individual acquiring the same narrow‚Ä¶ representations as the other group members have. Social learning of this type (another, similar process is known as local enhancement) has been shown to lead to relatively stable social transmission of behavior over time\\". Local enhancement is the driving mechanism that influences the audience to embody and recreate the messages produced in media. Statistically, men are actively engaging in the production of these problematic representations, whereas, women are not contributing to the portrayal of women experiences because of local enhancement that takes place on the web. There is no exact number to determine the precise percentage for female users; in 2011 there were numerous surveys that slightly fluctuate in numbers, but none seem to surpass 15 percent. This shows a large disparity of online users in regards to gender when looking at Wikipedia content. Bias arises as the content presented in Wikipedia seems to be more male oriented.  Promise and potential = In mass media and civic engagement  Participatory culture has been hailed by some as a way to reform communication and enhance the quality of media. According to media scholar Henry Jenkins, one result of the emergence of participatory cultures is an increase in the number of media resources available, giving rise to increased competition between media outlets. Producers of media are forced to pay more attention to the needs of consumers who can turn to other sources for information. Howard Rheingold and others have argued that the emergence of participatory cultures will enable deep social change. Until as recently as the end of the 20th century, Rheingold argues, a handful of generally privileged, generally wealthy people controlled nearly all forms of mass communication‚Äînewspapers, television, magazines, books and encyclopedias. Today, however, tools for media production and dissemination are readily available and allow for what Rheingold labels \\"participatory media.\\"Rheingold, Howard. (2008) \\"Welcome to Participatory Media Literacy.\\" Participatory Media Literacy. Available at http://www.socialtext.net/medialiteracy/index.cgi/ (accessed January 2009) As participation becomes easier, the diversity of voices that can be heard also increases. At one time only a few mass media giants controlled most of the information that flowed into the homes of the public, but with the advance of technology even a single person has the ability to spread information around the world. The diversification of media has benefits because in cases where the control of media becomes concentrated it gives those who have control the ability to influence the opinions and information that flows to the public domain. Media concentration provides opportunity for corruption, but as information continues to become accessed from more and more places it becomes increasingly difficult to control the flow of information to the will of an agenda. Participatory Culture is also seen as a more democratic form of communication as it stimulates the audience to take an active part because they can help shape the flow of ideas across media formats. The democratic tendency lent to communication by participatory culture allows new models of production that are not based on a hierarchical standard. In the face of increased participation, the traditional hierarchies will not disappear, but \\"Community, collaboration, and self-organization\\" can become the foundation of corporations as powerful alternatives. Although there may be no real hierarchy evident in many collaborative websites, their ability to form large pools of collective intelligence is not compromised.  In civics  Participatory culture civics organizations mobilize participatory cultures towards political action. They build on participatory cultures and organize such communities toward civic and political goals. Examples include Harry Potter Alliance, Invisible Children, Inc., and Nerdfighters, which each leverage shared cultural interests to connect and organize members towards explicit political goals. These groups run campaigns by informing, connecting, and eventually organizing their members through new media platforms. Neta Kligler-Vilenchik identified three mechanisms used to translate cultural interests into political outcomes:Kligler-Vilenchik, N. (2013). \\"Decreasing World Suck\\": Fan Communities, Mechanisms of Translation, and Participatory Politics. # Tapping shared passion around content worlds and their communities # Creative production of content # Informal discussion spaces for conversations about salient issues  In education  Social and participatory media allow for‚Äîand, indeed, call for‚Äîa shift in how we approach teaching and learning in the classroom. The increased availability of the Internet in classrooms allows for greater access to information. For example, it is no longer necessary for relevant knowledge to be contained in some combination of the teacher and textbooks; today, knowledge can be more de- centralized and made available for all learners to access. The teacher, then, can help facilitate efficient and effective means of accessing, interpreting, and making use of that knowledge.Leander, Kevin M. (2002) \\"'You Won't Be Needing Your Laptops Today': Wired Bodies in the Wireless Classroom.\\" In Michele Knobel and Colin Lankshear (eds.). A New Literacies Sampler. Available at  Challenges = In online platforms  Rachael Sullivan talks about how some online platforms can be a challenge. According to Rachael Sullivan book review, she emphasizes on Reddit, and the content that is used can be offensive and inappropriate. Memes, GIFs, and other content that users create are negative, and is used for trolling through the web. Reddit has a platform where anybody can come and use it. So, the challenge of the use of Reddit is to allow who can contribute to the platform. Other challenges include that other users in the community can post without restrictions or barriers. So, if a user wants to post something that is racist online, they can do it. It's a challenge because anybody can post anything online whether it's positive or negative. Also, if users are posting content that is unsuitable, then the online platforms can get a lot of backlash, and it could possibly lead to the online platforms being shut down for good. Based on the example of the book review, people can post whatever they want, and putting negative information on platforms can cause great damage on the internet such as getting backlash or becoming non-existent. = YouTube and Participatory Culture= YouTube has been the start up for many up and coming pop stars. Both Justin Bieber and One Direction shared their daily lives and interviews on YouTube thus launching their careers. Some users showed the world how simple it was to become a popular Youtuber. Charlie ‚ÄúHow to Get Featured on YouTube,‚Äù is basically calling out how simple it is to gain fame on YouTube. He doesn't even need to create a video to start up his career just a how to start up a career. YouTube offers the younger generation to test out their content while gaining feedback on so many levels. Content creators and receive likes dislikes and comments to find out where they need to improve.  For consumers  All people want to be a consumer in some and an active contributor in other situations. Being a consumer or active contributor is not an attribute of a person, but of a context. The important criteria that needs to be taken into account is personally meaningful activities. Participatory cultures empower humans to be active contributors in personally meaningful activities. The drawback of such cultures is that they may force humans to cope with the burden of being an active contributor in personally irrelevant activities. This trade-off can be illustrated with the potential and drawbacks of \\"Do-It-Yourself Societies\\": starting with self- service restaurants and self-service gas stations a few decades ago, and this trend has been greatly accelerated over the last 10 years. Through modern tools (including electronic commerce supported by the Web), humans are empowered to do many tasks themselves that were done previously by skilled domain workers serving as agents and intermediaries. While this shift provides power, freedom, and control to customers (e.g., banking can be done at any time of the day with ATMs, and from any location with the Web), it has led also to some less desirable consequences. People may consider some of these tasks not very meaningful personally and therefore would be more than content with a consumer role. Aside from simple tasks that require a small or no learning effort, customers lack the experience the professionals have acquired and maintained through daily use of systems, and the broad background knowledge to do these tasks efficiently and effectively. The tools used to do these tasks ‚Äî banking, travel reservations, buying airline tickets, checking out groceries at the supermarket ‚Äî are core technologies for the professionals, but occasional technologies for the customers. This will put a new, substantial burden on customers rather than having skilled domain workers doing these tasks. Significantly, too, as businesses increasingly recruit participatory practices and resources to market goods and services, consumers who are comfortable working within participatory media are at a distinct advantage over those who are less comfortable. Not only do consumers who are resistant to making use of the affordances of participatory culture have decreased access to knowledge, goods, and services, but they are less likely to take advantage of the increased leverage inherent in engaging with businesses as a prosumer.  In education  Participation gap = This category is linked to the issue of the digital divide, the concern with providing access to technology for all learners. The movement to break down the digital divide has included efforts to bring computers into classrooms, libraries, and other public places. These efforts have been largely successful, but as Jenkins et al. argue, the concern is now with the quality access to available technologies. They explain: > What a person can accomplish with an outdated machine in a public library > with mandatory filtering software and no opportunity for storage or > transmission pales in comparison to what [a] person can accomplish with a > home computer with unfettered Internet access, high band-width, and > continuous connectivity.(Current legislation to block access to social > networking software in schools and public libraries will further widen the > participation gap.) The school system's inability to close this > participation gap has negative consequences for everyone involved. On the > one hand,those youth who are most advanced in media literacies are often > stripped of their technologies and robbed of their best techniques for > learning in an effort to ensure a uniform experience for all in the > classroom. On the other hand, many youth who have had no exposure to these > new kinds of participatory cultures outside school find themselves > struggling to keep up with their peers. (Jenkins et al. pg. 15) Passing out the technology free of charge is not enough to ensure youth and adults learn how to use the tools effectively. Most American youths now have at least minimal access to networked computers, be it at school or in public libraries, but \\"children who have access to home computers demonstrate more positive attitudes towards computers, show more enthusiasm, and report more enthusiast and ease when using computer than those who do not (Page 8 Wartella, O'Keefe, and Scantlin (2000)). As the children with more access to computers gain more comfort in using them, the less tech-savvy students get pushed aside. It is important to note that it is more than a simple binary at work here, as working-class youths may still have access so some technologies (e.g. gaming consoles) while other forms remain unattainable. This inequality would allow certain skills to develop in some children, such as play, while others remain unavailable, such as the ability to produce and distribute self- created media. In a participatory culture, one of the key challenges that is encountered is participatory gap. This comes into play with the integration of media and society. Some of the largest challenges we face in regards to the participation gap is in education, learning, accessibility, and privacy. All of these factors are huge setbacks when it comes to the relatively new integration of youth participating in today's popular forms of media. Education is one realm where the participatory gap is very prominent. In today's society, our education system heavily focuses on integrating media into its curriculum. More and more our classrooms are utilizing computers and technology as learning aides. While this is beneficial for students and teachers to enhance learning environments and allow them to access a plethora of information, it also presents many problems. The participation gap leaves many schools as well as its teachers and students at a disadvantage as they struggle to utilize current technology in their curriculum. Many schools do not have to funding to invest in computers or new technologies for their academic programs. They are unable to afford computers, cameras, and interactive learning tools, which prevents students from accessing the tools that other, wealthier schools have. Another challenge is that as we integrate new technology into schools and academics, we need to be able to teach people how to use these instruments. Teaching both student and adults how to use new media technologies is essential so that they can actively participate as their peers do. Additionally, teaching children how to navigate the information available on new media technologies is very important as there is so much content available on the internet these days. For beginners this can be overwhelming and teaching kids as well as adults how to access what is pertinent, reliable and viable information will help them improve how they utilize media technologies. One huge aspect of the participation gap is access. Access to the Internet and computers is a luxury in some households, and in the today's society, access to a computer and the Internet is often overlooked by both the education system and many other entities. In today's society, almost everything we do is based online, from banking to shopping to homework and ordering food, we spend all of our time doing everyday tasks online. For those who are unable to access these things, they are automatically put at a severe disadvantage. They cannot participate in activities that their peers do and may suffer both academically and socially. The last feature of the participation gap is privacy concerns. We put everything on the Internet these days, from pictures to personal information. It is important to question how this content will be used. Who owns this content? Where does it go or where is it stored? For example, the controversy of Facebook and its ownership and rights of user's content has been a hot button issue over the past few years. It is disconcerting to a lot of people to find out that their content they have posted to a particular website is no longer under their control, but may be retained and used by the website in the future. All of the above-mentioned issued are key factors in the participation gap. They play a large role is the challenges we face as we incorporate new media technology into everyday life. These challenges affect how many populations interact with the changing media in society and unfortunately leave many at a disadvantage. This divide between users of new media and those who are unable to access these technologies is also referred to as the digital divide. It leaves low-income families and children at a severe disadvantage that affects them in the present as well as the future. Students for example are largely affected because without access to the Internet or a computer they are unable to do homework and projects and will moreover be unsuccessful in school. These poor grades can lead to frustration with academia and furthermore may lead to delinquent behavior, low income jobs, decreased chanced of pursuing higher educations, and poor job skills. = Transparency problem = Increased facility with technology does not necessarily lead to increased ability to interpret how technology exerts its own pressure on us. Indeed, with increased access to information, the ability to interpret the viability of that information becomes increasingly difficult. It is crucial, then, to find ways to help young learners develop tactics for engaging critically with the tools and resources they use. = Ethics challenge = This is identified as a \\"breakdown of traditional forms of professional training and socialization that might prepare young people for their increasingly public roles as media makers and community participants\\" (Jenkins et al. pg. 5). For example, throughout most of the last half of the 20th century learners who wanted to become journalists would generally engage in a formal apprenticeship through journalism classes and work on a high school newspaper. This work would be guided by a teacher who was an expert in the rules and norms of journalism and who would confer that knowledge to student- apprentices. With increasing access to Web 2.0 tools, however, anybody can be a journalist of sorts, with or without an apprenticeship to the discipline. A key goal in media education, then, must be to find ways to help learners develop techniques for active reflection on the choices they make‚Äîand contributions they offer‚Äîas members of a participatory culture. = Issues for educators and educational policy-makers = As teachers, administrators, and policymakers consider the role of new media and participatory practices in the school environment, they will need to find ways to address the multiple challenges. Challenges include finding ways to work with the decentralization of knowledge inherent in online spaces; developing policies with respect to filtering software that protects learners and schools without limiting students' access to sites that enable participation; and considering the role of assessment in classrooms that embrace participatory practices. Cultures are substantially defined by their media and their tools for thinking, working, learning, and collaborating. Unfortunately a large number of new media are designed to see humans only as consumers; and people, particularly young people in educational institutions, form mindsets based on their exposure to specific media. The current mindset about learning, teaching, and education is dominated by a view in which teaching is often fitted \\"into a mold in which a single, presumably omniscient teacher explicitly tells or shows presumably unknowing learners something they presumably know nothing about\\". A critical challenge is a reformulation and reconceptualization of this impoverished and misleading conception. Learning should not take place in a separate phase and in a separate place, but should be integrated into people's lives allowing them to construct solutions to their own problems. As they experience breakdowns in doing so, they should be able to learn on demand by gaining access to directly relevant information. The direct usefulness of new knowledge for actual problem situations greatly improves the motivation to learn the new material because the time and effort invested in learning are immediately worthwhile for the task at hand ‚Äî not merely for some putative long-term gain. In order to create active contributor mindsets serving as the foundation of participatory cultures, learning cannot be restricted to finding knowledge that is \\"out there\\". Rather than serving as the \\"reproductive organ of a consumer society\\"Illich, I. (1971) Deschooling Society, Harper and Row, New York, educational institutions must cultivate the development of an active contributor mindset by creating habits, tools and skills that help people become empowered and willing to actively contribute to the design of their lives and communities. Beyond supporting contributions from individual designers, educational institutions need to build a culture and mindset of sharing, supported by effective technologies and sustained by personal motivation to occasionally work for the benefit of groups and communities. This includes finding ways for people to see work done for the benefits of others being \\"on-task\\", rather than as extra work for which there is no recognition and no reward.  A new form of literacy  Jenkins et al. believes that conversation surrounding the digital divide should focus on opportunities to participate and to develop the cultural competencies and social skills required to take part rather than get stuck on the question of technological access. As institutions, schools have been slow on the uptake of participatory culture. Instead, afterschool programs currently devote more attention to the development of new media literacies, or, a set of cultural competencies and social skills that young people need in the new media landscape. Participatory culture shifts this literacy from the individual level to community involvement. Networking and collaboration develop social skills that are vital to the new literacies. Although new, these skills build on an existing foundation of traditional literacy, research skills, technical skills, and critical analysis skills taught in the classroom.  Meta-design: a design methodology supporting participatory cultures  Metadesign is \\"design for designers\\" It represents an emerging conceptual framework aimed at defining and creating social and technical infrastructures in which participatory cultures can come alive and new forms of collaborative design can take place. It extends the traditional notion of system design beyond the original development of a system to allow users become co-designers and co- developers. It is grounded in the basic assumption that future uses and problems cannot be completely anticipated at design time, when a system is developed. Users, at use time, will discover mismatches between their needs and the support that an existing system can provide for them. These mismatches will lead to breakdowns that serve as potential sources of new insights, new knowledge, and new understanding. Meta-design supports participatory cultures as follows: # Making changes must seem possible: Contributors should not be intimidated and should not have the impression that they are incapable of making changes; the more users become convinced that changes are not as difficult as they think they are, the more they may be willing to participate. # Changes must be technically feasible: If a system is closed, then contributors cannot make any changes; as a necessary prerequisite, there needs to be possibilities and mechanisms for extension. # Benefits must be perceived: Contributors have to believe that what they get in return justifies the investment they make. The benefits perceived may vary and can include professional benefits (helping for one's own work), social benefits (increased status in a community, possibilities for jobs), and personal benefits (engaging in fun activities). # The environments must support tasks that people engage in: The best environments will not succeed if they are focused on activities that people do rarely or consider of marginal value. # Low barriers must exist to sharing changes: Evolutionary growth is greatly accelerated in systems in which participants can share changes and keep track of multiple versions easily. If sharing is difficult, it creates an unnecessary burden that participants are unwilling to overcome.

At that time it was replaced with the DAF 66. All 55s featured the unique Variomatic belt-driven continuously variable transmission, with no manual transmission available. This feature of all DAF cars was very unusual for its class at the time. The 55 was available as a 2-door saloon, a 3-door estate and a 2-door coupe. In total 164,231 DAF 55s were built. Origins The 55 was developed to be a more powerful version of the 1966 DAF 44. The redesign was extensive, and featured the following major changes: *Powertrain **Because the 44's two-cylinder DAF-designed boxer engine was at the end of its development, DAF partnered with Renault to build a version of their 1108 cc water-cooled inline 4 C-series engine, dubbed the B110. *Suspension **The front suspension was changed from the 44's transverse leaf spring setup to longitudinally mounted torsion bars. At the rear the 44's swing axle Variomatic layout was retained. *Braking **For added safety a dual circuit brake system was fitted. All models also featured front disc brakes as opposed to the 44's drum brakes. *Bodywork **The front panel was changed to provide room and airflow to the radiator. The rest of the car featured detail trim changes to set it apart from the lesser 44. All this heightened performance to a 136 km/h top speed, and made for a more practical car. Model chronology The saloon was launched at the end of 1967, with the coupe version launched three months later, in March 1968. The coupe was overall more elegant than the saloon, featuring a lower and gently sloping roof line, pillarless doors and a more upscale interior featuring reclining seats, carpet instead of the saloon's rubber mats and fake wood on the dashboard. Although the roof line turned it from a 4-seater into a 2+2, the coupe was a very successful model; 1 in 8 sold DAF 55s was a coupe. In September 1968 the estate version became available. In August 1969 there was a minor facelift of the whole model range and a delivery version became available, essentially a 55 estate without a rear seat. After the success of the DAF 55 in the London-Sydney Marathon, the dealer option 'Marathon' package was introduced. The multi-tier package meant that the dealer could fit an optical package with alloy wheels and interior parts, an uprated suspension, parts to upgrade the B110 engine to , or all of the above. In 1971 the factory version of this package was introduced, simply called the 55 Marathon. This did not feature an upgraded suspension, and had a 1108 cc engine, the BR110. This raised the top speed to 145 km/h. The 55 Marathon featured wider steel wheels, exterior striping and a brake booster was added for safety and comfort. The Marathon was available as a saloon or a coupe. In 1971 the coupe received normal doors with pillars, since the earlier pillarless design proved to be leaky and noisy at speed. Motorsport The DAF factory was very involved in motorsport, to show the world that the Variomatic transmission was reliable as well as sporty. The 55 relieved the 44 in the works rally program, and had various successes. A 55 won the 1968 Alpine Rally, and in late 1968 Rob Slotemaker finished 17th out of 100 contestants in the grueling 16500 km London-Sydney Marathon. This remarkable success inspired the later 'Marathon' range offered by DAF. Because of the Variomatic and its function as a limited slip differential it was also popular with many privateers in the rally world. Jan de Rooy, of Paris Dakar fame, built his own 4-wheel drive version, with a mid mounted Ford BDA engine coupled to a special Variomatic and campaigned it with great success on the international rallycross theatre throughout the early 1970s.

Volcanic activity has been detected there since 1869. Since then it has undergone more eruptions, the most powerful of which resulted in the appearance and disappearance of a small island. The name My≈çjin-sh≈ç derives from a fishing boat, No.11 My≈çjin-Maru of Yaizu City, Shizuoka Prefecture, the crew of which first witnessed the major volcanic eruption of 1952. Eruption of 1952-1953 A mysterious reef raised a volcanic plume and \\"Chihuri-class patrol vessel\\" sailors looked at it (1952) The volcanic eruption from 1952 to 1953 was one of its biggest eruptions on record, with the repetitious appearance and disappearance of an island, which at one point reached over ten metres above sea level, before sinking after a major volcanic eruption in September 1953. On September 24, 1952, a survey vessel, Kaiyo Maru No. 5 of the Hydrographic Department of the Maritime Safety Agency, was destroyed by the volcano, with the loss of its crew of 31 (including the nine scientists studying the eruption). Consequently, the Department developed Manbou (Sunfish), an unmanned radio operating survey boat, and has used it for the research of dangerous sea areas such as submarine volcanoes. This was the first time that volcanic activity had been detected using the SOFAR channel. \\"Transpacific detection of Myojin volcanic explosions by underwater sound\\" Survey of 1998-1999 In 1998 and 1999, the Hydrography Department conducted comprehensive sea bottom surveys around My≈çjin-sh≈ç, using the state-of-the-art survey vessel Shoyo and Manbou II, the second generation Manbou. As a result of these surveys, a detailed picture of the seabed topography around My≈çjin-sh≈ç was made for the first time. Manbou II conducted the survey of the sea area within a radius of 3 nautical miles (about 5.4 kilometers) of My≈çjin-sh≈ç. Shoyo conducted the survey of the sea area within a radius of about 10 nautical miles (about 18.5 kilometers) but farther than the area of the radius of . Manbou II works by the order of preprogrammed instructions and measures depth and water temperature. Bathymetric survey of Manbou II was carried out by using the \\"PRD-601\\" echo sounder at intervals of 0.2 nautical miles (about 370 meters). Shoyo conducted a comprehensive survey including the geological and geophysical surveys of sea bottom. Bathymetric survey of Shoyo was carried out by using a \\"Seabeam 2112\\" echo sounder at intervals of 0.5 nautical miles (about 930 meters). Structure Previously, My≈çjin-sh≈ç was considered to be the central cone of a double volcano with the Bayonnaise Rocks (rocks of 9.9 meters in height above the sea level) as a portion of the somma (Mita, 1949). As a result of the survey, however, the authors found that both My≈çjin-sh≈ç and the Bayonnaise Rocks are cones on the somma of a double volcano. The foot of this double volcano lies 1,400 to 1,500 meters in depth and the size is about 30 by 25 kilometers east-west, north-south. The somma is almost a circle in the diameter of 7 by 9 kilometers and the height is 1,000 ‚Äì 1,400meters. The diameter of the caldera floor is 5.6 kilometers and about 1,100 meters in depth. The central cone is a high formerly known as Takane-sh≈ç, 328 metres below sea level. My≈çjin-sh≈ç is a post caldera cone formed in the northeastern part of the somma of the double volcano. It is a single conical cone and its height is 550 meters with the shallowest depth 50 meters. A record that suggests a gushing of bubbles near the summit was obtained and micro- earthquakes were observed near My≈çjin-sh≈ç, showing that the volcano is still active, although at a low level.

In his professional career, he competed on the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) tour. He is a two-time PBR World Champion (2005 and 2007), has a record 32 career wins, and was the first professional bull rider to earn more than $5 million in the course of his career. McBride is to be inducted into the Class of 2020 in the Bull Riding Hall of Fame in August. He is a country music singer and is also one of the color commentators for the PBR's Unleash the Beast Series telecasts on CBS Sports Network.  Early and personal life  Justin McBride was born in Texas and lived in Belton, Texas until he later moved to Mullen, Nebraska with his parents and older brother. His father, who worked on a ranch, rode bulls; his maternal grandfather was killed in a bull- riding event the year before McBride was born. McBride excelled at bareback horse and bull riding, played eight-man football and wrestled. He attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas on a rodeo scholarship; he left after a year to go pro at 19. McBride currently lives in Whitesboro, Texas with his wife and two children. Career McBride recalls his debut in the PBR's rookie league, the Challenger Tour, as 'rough'. When he qualified for the main PBR tour in 1999 (then known as the Bud Light Cup Series), he finishied fourth in his first-ever premier series event, which was held in Bakersfield, California. He claimed his first win in his next event, which was in Odessa, Texas. Coupled with two more third-place finishes (one in Albuquerque, New Mexico and one in Reno, Nevada), he qualified for his first PBR World Finals and finished fourteenth in the world in his rookie year of 1999, with $89,007 in earnings. In 2000, McBride had several top finishes, but no wins. His big success of that year came when he won the Mossy Oak shootout twice - once in Greensboro, North Carolina for $15,000, and again in Houston, Texas for $30,000. He finished ninth in the world in 2000, with $144,764 in earnings, and was named the Mossy Oak Shootout Champion that year. In 2001, McBride stepped up his game and won 5 events that year, putting himself into a three- man race for the PBR World Championship title against Adriano Moraes and Ty Murray. Unfortunately for McBride, he faltered at the finals (as did Murray) and the Brazilian, Moraes, ended up winning his second world title that year. McBride finished third in the world that year, winning $302,217 for his efforts. In 2002, McBride did not get to match the success he had in 2001, but he still won the Bud Light Cup event in Nashville, Tennessee and finished fifth in the world overall that year. He made $181,546 that year. 2003 saw a whole new Justin McBride. He put himself into a tight two-man race between himself and Chris Shivers for the world title that year, winning two Built Ford Tough Series events in the process (Anaheim, California and St. Louis, Missouri). McBride was in the lead for the world title going into the Grand Rapids, Michigan Built Ford Tough series, but unfortunately, disaster struck. He was stepped on by a bull named Mission Pack in the short-go of that event, breaking two ribs and puncturing a lung. Many thought McBride would not make it to the finals, but he did go. He won the first go-round and very nearly took the title away from Shivers, but when McBride bucked off of Mossy Oak Mudslinger in the short-go of the finals, Shivers was awarded the PBR World title and the first ever million-dollar bonus that was awarded to a world champion. McBride finished 2nd overall in 2003 with $281,606 in earnings. In 2004, McBride picked up where he left off and won 4 events that year. His main rivals for the world title that year were Adriano Moraes and Mike Lee. He stayed in 2nd place for most of the year, but due to a new points system implemented for the Finals that year, it would be possible for him to catch the leader (who at that point was Adriano, who had a 1,800-point lead heading into the finals). However, for the second year in a row, disaster struck again for McBride in Grand Rapids. This time, in that event's Mossy Oak Shootout, the bull named Lefty stepped on his right ankle as he was bucked off, breaking it. McBride would need surgery and again, people thought he would not make it to the finals. He did, three weeks later, and turned in some heroic performances early on. Unfortunately, he bucked off his last few bulls and ended up 4th in the world overall that year. He made $303,928 in 2004. Lee would go on to win the PBR world championship that year in a historic come- from-behind performance. In 2005, McBride would not be denied. He won 6 Built Ford Tough series events, tying a record originally set by Cody Hart in 1999 (the same year Hart won his PBR world title). In the middle of the year he found himself in a heated race for the PBR World Title with Brazilian rider Guilherme Marchi. The two battled it out at the PBR World Finals, and the short-go actually came down to Marchi and McBride. The pressure was on McBride after Marchi successfully made the whistle on the bull Kid Rock. McBride answered by hanging for dear life to the bull Camo, off the side for much of the ride, but nevertheless rode the bull successfully. McBride had overcome adversity and finally won his first-ever PBR World Title in 2005, with over $1.5 million in earnings for the year, a PBR record. His final ride was on a bull named Camo (oddly, McBride would win the title in 2007 on that same bull), and the ride was notable for the fact that McBride spent most of the needed eight seconds literally hanging off the side of the bull. With the monkey off his back, McBride decided he'd have fun in 2006. He maintained a consistent riding average and had several top finishes. In the middle of the year he took time off to spend with his wife, Jill, who gave birth to their new daughter, Addisen Claire McBride. McBride took six events off, but when he came back, he was still in the mix for a world title. He won 3 BFTS events upon his return (and in 2 events rode 2 previously-unridden bulls in the short-go rounds), but the Finals did not go as well as he had hoped. He still earned $232,757 that year and finished 6th overall. In 2007, McBride chased a second world title. He won a record 8 events on the BFTS that year, and battled it out with 2nd-year pro J.B. Mauney for the world title. At the BFTS event in Chihuahua, Mexico, McBride hung up to the bull named Gnash and suffered a serious left shoulder injury that was first meant to put him out for the year, but he then came back two events later in Greensboro, North Carolina, to win his eighth event of the year, which is the new PBR record for most events won in a single season. He was also named the Alphatrade National Champion of 2007 and chose to ride the bull, Scene of the Crash, for 200,000 dollars, making it the richest ride in PBR history. He finished this season by winning his second PBR title in three years. As in 2005, he did it riding a bull named Camo in the final round; unlike in 2005, McBride stayed on top of the bull without hanging on the side. His total season earnings in 2007 was $1,836,002. Due to the shoulder injury, though, McBride elected to have surgery after the Finals, and was out of competition for about 6 months after the surgery. McBride came back to the Built Ford Tough Series at the 2008 Dickies American Worker of the Year Invitational in Dallas, Texas, and, finishing 7th overall at the event, seemed to pick up where he left off. He showed the world he was back for sure when he won the very next event, which was the Express Classic in Tulsa, Oklahoma, pocketing over $30,000 in that one weekend. He later went on to win the Jack Daniels Invitational in Nashville, Tennessee, and in doing so, secured himself yet another qualification for the PBR World Finals. A few events later, McBride achieved another milestone, breaking the $5 million mark in PBR career earnings, the first rider to ever do so. However, shortly before the finals, having qualified 15th in the standings, McBride announced that he would retire at the end of the season to concentrate on his second career in country music, saying, \\"I don't wanna do it anymore.\\"Steve Silver, \\"Ex-UNLV star McBride retires from pro bull riding,\\" Las Vegas Sun October 21, 2008. He put on a show at the 2008 PBR Finals, riding 5 out of 8 bulls (including two go-round wins) to finish 6th overall at the event. His final ride saw him bucked off Voodoo Child, the bull that he rode in Tulsa for the event win earlier in the year, ending his final season ranked 21st in the world with $221,090 in earnings. McBride acknowledged the crowd and walked away happy that he would not have to ride again. However, McBride did come out of retirement for two more special bull rides. In 2014, at a special event known as RFD-TV's \\"The American\\", which was held at AT&T; Stadium in Arlington, Texas, he faced off against NFL defensive end Jared Allen's bull, Air Time, in a bonus ride, but was bucked off in less than 2 seconds. Then, on May 30, 2015, he competed in a special event called \\"Unfinished Business\\" (which took place during the J.W. Hart Challenge at the Wise County Sheriff's Posse Arena in Decatur, Texas), which featured McBride and other PBR legends coming back to attempt one more bull; there, he was bucked off a bull called Oyster Creek in just over 3 seconds. In 2009, McBride was honored with the Heroes and Legends Celebration: Ring of Honor, the PBR's equivalent of a hall of fame award. In 2016, he was inducted into the Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame.

He played representative level rugby union (RU) for England, and at club level for Orrell R.U.F.C. (two spells), and Liverpool St Helens F.C. as a Wing, and club level rugby league (RL) for Oldham, at the time of his move to Oldham, he was employed by Merseyside Police. Background Nigel Heslop was born in West Hartlepool, England. International honours Nigel Heslop represented England on ten occasions between 1990-1992, playing in two of the matches of the 1991 Rugby World Cup, including a very physical encounter with France. He was a member of England's 1991 5 Nations Grand Slam winning side, scoring a try against the Scots at Twickenham in the Calcutta Cup match of that year. He was surprisingly dropped for the first two matches of the World Cup, in favour of Chris Oti: marked his return with a try in the third and final group-stage match against the USA: but emerged from the quarter-final against France considerably battered and bruised. Although he completed the match he was not judged fit to start in either the semi-final or final, and with Oti also injured, Heslop's place on the wing was taken by the squad's utility-back replacement, Simon Halliday - who more usually played centre. Heslop took a place on the bench for both matches but was not called on to play. England kept the World Cup Final back line in place throughout the 1992 season, keeping Heslop on the bench: his final international appearance was in the last match of that season, coming on as a replacement for Carling in the final few minutes. Thus the match, and his career, finished with the brief and incongruous situation of Heslop (a specialist winger) playing in the centre, while Halliday (a specialist centre) played on the wing in Heslop's usual position. Heslop subsequently switched codes to play Rugby League for Oldham, bringing an end to his chances of international selection for the Rugby Union team. He returned to Rugby Union - and his old club Orrell RFC - in 1995, but did not challenge for international selection again.

Originally considered a subtype of the Ardennes, it was recognized as an individual breed with the opening of a studbook in 1903. Developed in the fertile Flemish grasslands, it was bred for size and pulling power for agricultural work. By 1855, the horses bred near Hainaut were considered by some veterinarians to be superior to other Flemish draft breeds. The Trait du Nord was used extensively in mining from the late 19th century through 1920, with lesser use continuing through the 1960s. The Trait du Nord continued to be used extensively for agriculture through World War II, but after the war this usage, and the breed population, declined significantly as farming became increasingly mechanized. During the mid-20th century, the breed was in demand for the production of horse meat, and due to this was bred to be larger and heavier. In the early 1970s, the market for horse meat began to decline, and the Trait du Nord, like many European draft breeds, was in danger of extinction. It was not until the 1990s that the breed experienced a slight revival through an increased interest in recreational riding and driving. The Trait du Nord is large, with stallions weighing upwards of , and is bred for traction ability and pulling power. The breed is found in many solid colors, although bay and roan are the most common, and is known to be gentle and easy to handle. Two slightly different types of Trait du Nord are found ‚Äì a larger type used for heavier pulling and a lighter type used for faster work. The breed is considered to be endangered by the French government, with fewer than 100 new foal births a year. The national breed registry in France is working with local groups in an attempt to promote this breed and bring population numbers back up. The breed currently has a high risk of inbreeding, due to the low number of breeding stallions, and is at risk of extinction. Naming and registration According to the French National Stud, the current official name of the breed is Trait du Nord. The name has changed several times during its history. In the mid-19th century it is mentioned as the \\"large horse of Hainaut\\",Moll, et al., p. 531 but before 1903 it was not considered a separate breed and was often thought to be the same as the Ardennes.Mavr√©, p. 44 Beginning in 1913, it was known as the Trait Ardennes North, and from 1945Bernard, et al., pp. 122‚Äì123 to 1965 was known as the Northern Ardennes Draft. The name of Trait du Nord became commonly used around 1961. Until August 5, 1903, the Trait du Nord's studbook was merged with that of the Ardennes, with the former being considered a subtype of the latter and called the Northern type Ardennes. The studbook was under the responsibility of the combined group \\"Studbook of Northern Workhorses\\". In 1913, the name of Trait du Nord was used for the first time and French mares began to be registered as their own breed, although Belgian horses continued to be used for breeding, with the resulting progeny able to be registered as Trait du Nords. In 1919, the northern type was separated from the Ardennes, although the studbooks remained tied, and the horse was given the name \\"Northern Ardennes\\". A centralized breeding union for the Northern Ardennes was created in 1945. In France, the (Union of Trait du Nord Horse Breeders) is the national breed association recognized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Its mission is to promote the breed and assist in its recovery, as well as creating and executing a policy of genetic improvement through selective breeding. The association works with the French National Stud and the Center for Genetic Resources to develop breeding programs and represents the Trait du Nord on French breed committees. It also organizes and contributes to contests and events that help to promote and develop the breed. Breed characteristics Head of a mare In the early 1930s, the breed reached the peak of its physical structure.Mavr√©, p. 38 It was then described as a born laborer, built for traction and with a conformation that allowed it to move huge weights over short distances.Mavr√©, p. 42 Although some breeds of draft horses have declined in weight in modern times, the Trait du Nord has remained relatively large. The average size in the breed is for mares and for stallions, weighing for mares and for stallions. Foals of 30 months who are candidates to become registered must be at least . Bay and roan are the most frequent colors seen in the breed. Chestnut (including liver chestnut, although this color is quite rare) is also allowed, as are black, brown and gray, although the latter is extremely rare. In France, the National Stud regulates the physical standards of the Trait du Nord and eight other French breeds. The eligibility criteria have changed several times since the opening of the studbook in 1913, and now describe the ideal Trait du Nord as large, well built, short and powerful, with a large frame and well-developed muscles, energetic, with easygoing and beautiful gaits. Members of the breed are described by the breed association as courageous and observant, as well as gentle and easy to handle. The head is generally small in proportion to the mass of the horse, and often snub, with a flat profile (neither concave nor convex). The neck is of medium length and strong, often slightly arched. The withers are prominent and the shoulder long and slightly oblique. The back is short and straight and the body compact, solid and very muscular. The chest is deep, with a broad, muscular breast. The croup is wide and powerfully muscled. The hooves are hard and strong. There are two main types of Trait du Nord. One is a heavier type bred for pulling heavy loads, while the other is a lighter type bred for slightly faster work, generally at the trot. Auxois, Ardennes, Brabant and some Dutch draft breeds may be admitted to the Trait du Nord studbook after being inspected and approved by a review panel. Registered horses are marked with a stylized \\"N\\" brand on the left side of the neck, signifying conformity to the breed standard. History The ancestors of the breed lived in the northern river valleys of the Sambre and the Scheldt, near Valenciennes. Although it is a popular myth that many French draft breeds, including the Trait du Nord, are descendants of the prehistoric horses found at Solutr√©, this is not true. Two or possibly three subspecies of now-extinct equines have been found at Solutr√©, but there is no evidence that they migrated to the area that later produced the Trait du Nord. Like Dutch and Belgian draft breeds such as the Brabant, the origin of the Trait du Nord is found in the large, fertile Flemish grasslands that cover the southern portion of the Netherlands, northern France and all of Belgium. The Hainaut region is the true birthplace of the breed in France. The Belgian draft breeds, the Ardennes and the Trait du Nord share the same ancestry, and the Trait du Nord has a history that is very similar to the Ardennes, due to the influence of the latter breed on the former. The Ardennes, Belgian, Dutch Heavy Draft, Trait du Nord and Auxois are all considered to come from the same group of breeds, due to their heritage, physical characteristics and selection for draft work. Until relatively recently, the breeds were not differentiated, and were frequently crossbred. A Boulonnais horse, used to add elegance to the Trait du Nord in the late 19th century The region of Flanders is particularly conducive to agriculture, and in the 19th century the draining of the swamps and improved farming techniques led to a major expansion in cultivated areas and farm sizes. As there were no existing horses in the area that were suitable for plowing, the farmers found it necessary to create a breed of draft horse specifically for their use. From the 1850s on, farmers selected horses that eventually became the Trait du Nord. The farmers combined large Belgian breeds adapted to swampy ground with the Ardennes and Dutch breeds for size, weight and strength. The result was a muscular, powerful, and tough breed with long legs that facilitated movement. The Trait du Nord was unique in being selected specifically for farming, as many draft breeds were also bred for use in transport. The Trait du Nord proved a successful breed for the farmers that developed it, and quickly spread throughout the Netherlands, Belgium and northern France. It was given different names depending on the country, and was often confused with and crossbred with draft breeds from the Netherlands, Brabants and the Ardennes. Breed associations began to organize in the late 19th century, and at this point blood from the Boulonnais was introduced to bring more elegance to the breed. The Trait du Nord gradually began to differ from the Ardennes as they gained size and volume and improved their gaits, and the breed became popular in the north and east of France. In 1855, even before the breed had been differentiated from the Ardennes, veterinarians described the heavy horses bred near Hainaut as superior to Flemish breeds.Journal des V√©t√©rinaires du Midi, p. 558 20th century During World War I, Trait du Nord horses were among those confiscated by Germans from Belgium and France for use in the war. In 1919, these horses were returned to their homeland, allowing the reconstruction of the breed.Dal'Secco, p. 32 During World War II, the armed forces used all stocks of fuel, and the draft horse was used to continue agricultural production in France.Mavr√©, p. 66 After the war, farmers quickly equipped themselves with mechanized equipment. The decline in the breeding of the Trait du Nord became noticeable in the early 1950s, and by 1960 breed numbers had collapsed completely. By the early 1970s, breeding had slowed so much that the Trait du Nord, along with other French draft breeds, was in danger of extinction.Mavr√©, p. 31 As horses were replaced by tractors, the production of horse meat became the main viable market for the Trait du Nord and other French breeds. As the horses were sought for meat, the larger, heavier animals became more in demand, and these horses lost much of their power and pulling ability. A French decree on August 24, 1976, published in the Official Journal, encouraged farmers to select the biggest, heaviest stallions for breeding. The French National Stud backed this decree, and encouraged the breeding of foals that would fatten rapidly, to be butchered at the age of eighteen months. Between the mid-20th century and the 1980s, the average weight of the Trait du Nord increased from between to over .Mavr√©, p. 150 Since the early 1970s, the use of the Trait du Nord for meat has declined, contributing to a further reduction in breeding. In the early 1990s, recreational riding experienced a revival, and the consumption of horse meat continued to decrease. On March 11, 1994, the Trait du Nord was officially declared to be a workhorse again, and in 1996 another decree prohibited docking of tails in horses. Members of the breed are occasionally exported from France, with some going to Italy, Belgium and Germany, mainly for work in logging and pulling brewery wagons. A few are sent to Sicily and Guadeloupe, but this is quite rare. Uses The \\"large horse of Hainaut\\" circa 1861 The Trait du Nord was originally used mainly for agriculture and mining. They also towed barges on waterways, although this use ended quickly with the increased use of the engine at the beginning of the 20th century. The peak use of the breed for agriculture was quite short, running from 1880 to around 1960 (ending due to increased use of mechanized equipment), but it allowed significant progress in agriculture in northern France.Mavr√©, p. 43 The stamina and energy of the breed allows them to perform well in the heavy and compact soils in the region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais and recover quickly after exercise. The nature of soils in Hainaut required a horse weighing more than for effective plowing. Since the 1950s, the Trait du Nord has been the preferred breed for farmers who practiced intensive cropping of cereals and beets in the Northern Great Plains of France. The pulling power of the Trait du Nord made it popular for use during the Industrial Revolution of the late 19th century in heavy industry, including mining. In mines, steam engines and internal combustion engines could not be used due to the possibility of a gas explosion. The first horses were used in the mines in 1821 and the Trait du Nord quickly became a favorite for hauling carts in the mines and operating the pulleys used to lift coal to the surface.Dumont and Debrabant, p. 14 Breeders worked to adapt the breed to mining requirements, and the breed became larger as more power was needed to pull heavier loads. Good horses were able to pull , usually around twelve cars worth, along a railway. As early as 1920, the usage of horses in mines began to decline as electric locomotives came into use, and in 1969 the last horse was removed from the mines. 1990s and today Today, the breed is used mainly for meat and logging forested areas inaccessible to machinery. Since the mid-1990s, colts not intended for breeding, recreational riding, or harness work are heavily fed and sent out to slaughter before the age of eighteen months. Fillies are generally used for breeding. The breed association and its breeders are trying to secure the future of the Trait du Nord by finding new markets, especially in the areas of recreational riding, agricultural work, recreational and competitive driving. The breed is involved in several reenactments and folk villages which attract good crowds. The breed is promoted for its use in logging in forests and fragile areas, with professional foresters using them to preserve the value and biodiversity of forested areas. The revival of team driving has prompted farmers who use the Trait du Nord to attend competitions and improve the quality of their horses. The qualities of the breed make it a popular horse for leaders in the areas of recreational and competition team driving, and the breed has the advantage of being able to be immediately returned to work even after a period of inactivity for several months. When being driven, a traditional \\"Flemish collar\\" is generally used. The horses are trained to be driven with only one rein, leaving the driver's hands free for other work. When shown in hand, Trait du Nord horses are often presented in groups, generally between four and eight to a string. Each year, the Trait du Nord is honored at an agricultural show and horse show in Paris. In 1995, the breed won the International Workhorse Trophy at the Paris show and in 2010, a Trait du Nord took the first place prize for weight pulling at the show. Trait du Nord teams participate in the Route du Poisson, a relay race commemorating the route that teams took to bring fresh fish from Boulogne to Paris until the 19th century. The race takes place every two or three years and is the biggest equine relay race in Europe. Breed preservation A horse under saddle at a show in 2009 The Trait du Nord is an endangered breed; the Haras de Compi√®gne (Compiegne Stud), a national stud in France, had a major influence in saving the breed, until it was closed in October 2009. The national breed registry for the Trait du Nord is supported by other local initiatives. However, breed numbers were already low when these initiatives began to be implemented, and media attention on the Trait du Nord is insufficient to maintain economically viable interest. The breed is bred mainly by enthusiasts returning to family farms, but even the number of farms has been decreasing as many young farmers prefer more to breed cattle, which are more lucrative. Although breed associations and the French National Stud are making efforts to protect the breed, very low numbers persist, and these organizations consider the breed very close to extinction. It is one of the most threatened French horse breeds. The production of horse meat has declined due to a decrease in consumption, and most male foals are neither selected for reproduction nor work. One author says that more alternatives to slaughter are needed and that the steady decline in breed numbers is proof that the breed is slowly disappearing. Beginning in 2011, the Trait du Nord association is working with the North Pas-de-Calais regional council and other groups to increase the number of births by 20 percent by December 2014, and double the number by 2020. The main breeding areas are located around the former Compiegne Stud and include the departments of Nord, the Pas-de-Calais, the Oise, the Aisne and Somme. A few are found in the central region of Normandy and the Paris area. This breed is found mainly in France and is rarely exported abroad, or only very sporadically with related Belgian and Dutch breeds. A survey of mares in 2008 gave 121 mares in the region of North Pas-de-Calais, 46 in Picardy, 6 in Normandy and one to three mares in the other regions. Despite efforts to revive interest in the breed, numbers steadily declined in the years before 1988.Bongianni, p. 93 In 1995, there were 33 stallions in service; in 1996 this number remained the same and by 1998 it had declined to 30. In 2004, there were 111 breeders and 119 Trait du Nord foals were registered. By 2007 and 2008 there were only 17 stallions registered, a number which is exposing the breed to a dangerous increase in inbreeding. To combat this danger, farmers are cross breeding the Trait du Nord with approved Belgian and Dutch horses. The number of farmers breeding the Trait du Nord decreased from 150 to 125 in 2002, then to 92 in 2007 and 86 in 2008. After birth rates remained relatively steady in the 1990s, they began to drop in the 2000s, declining from 176 in 2000 to 100 in 2005 and just 75 in 2007.

The most popular cultural activity in the town is called the \\"Kufenstechen\\", which is a customary church parish festival among the Alpine farming community. This annual event, held on Whit Monday, is celebrated in the month of May and marks the participation of unmarried men riding bareback on Noriker horses, wearing traditional costumes. The event involves horse riders striking a wooden barrel with an iron club till the last wooden splinter is felled; this involves several rounds of horse riding around the barrel till it is broken fully. The winner is given a flower wreath, which he wears on his wrist. This festival is said to be observed since 1630 AD. After the horse ride, a traditional dance festival is held under a lime tree (called the \\"Linde Dance\\") with the winner of the horse event getting the first dance. Unmarried girls participate in the dance dressed in traditional \\"Gailtaler\\" costumes. The dance is accompanied by traditional songs, some in Slovenian. The Feistritz Festival is an important event for the parish. Boys and girls practice the event's dances weeks before it starts. The dances performed are the Linde dance, polka and waltz. The boys also practice horse riding and the girls flaunt their colourful hand made costumes. The parish also holds the annual \\"Maypole celebration\\" on the occasion of the Austrian independence day on 10 October.

It lies approximately equidistant between the burghs of Moffat and Selkirk, and defended the north eastern end of St Mary's Loch. The site itself was protected on two sides, to the east by the Dryhope Burn and to the west by the Kirkstead Burn. Construction Built of local stone, Dryhope Tower was originally a four storey building, with the first two storeys of vaulted construction. The tower rests within the remains of a barmkin which also contained other buildings. History The tower was likely to have been raised according to a statute of the Parliament of Scotland in 1535, that required large landholders in the Borderlands to build barmkins of stone and lime, sixty square feet in area and with walls of one ell thickness and six ells in height for the resett and defense of him, his tennents, and his gudis in troublous tyme.https://archive.org/stream/castellateddomes03macguoft#page/406/mode/2up The castle belonged to the Scotts of Dryhope, and a daughter of the House, Mary Scott was known as the \\"Flower of Yarrow\\" and was also an ancestor of Sir Walter Scott. Mary was given in marriage to Wat Scott of Kirkhope, a notorious Border Reiver. The property passed to Wat Scott's family, the Scotts of Harden, and Scott took possession of Dryhope following his marriage. However, in 1592, Wat Scott fell out of favour with King James VI due to his association with Francis Stewart, 1st Earl of Bothwell, and involvement in an attack on Falkland Palace. King James levied an army and proceeded through the forest and slighted many houses of his opponents. Wat Scott did not get off lightly and Dryhope was amongst Scott of Harden's fortalices that were slighted.Register of the Privy Council, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1881), p. 769. The tower seems to have been rebuilt by 1613. The castle fell into terminal decay in the latter part of the 17th century and was acquired by the senior branch of the Scotts, the Dukes of Buccleuch. Dryhope Tower today belongs to the Philiphaugh Estate, and has recently been undergoing stabilisation work. It has been designated a scheduled monument by Historic Environment Scotland.

History Protestant church The hidden Gegend was not populated until the High Middle Ages, when about 1300 its sunny northern side was stubbed and the name of the valley was first mentioned in a 1308 deed. While large estates were held by the Carinthian Counts of Ortenburg, the village called Rauth (from , root out) was the most important settlement in the whole area for a long time. The settlement of Feld am See itself arose with the construction of a Protestant parish church in 1787. The remote Gegend valley had long been a centre of Crypto-protestantism, until the 1781 Patent of Toleration issued by Emperor Joseph II ended the Counter-Reformation persecutions. The lake called Brennsee was named after a local tavern and distillery (Brenn) which was founded in 1632. The present-day municipality was established in 1850; an elementary school was founded one year later. In the late 19th century summer tourism around the lake started.

Their name derives from a diminutive of hou, a Norman/Guern√©siais word meaning islets. They are tidal islands. Among the islets are Houmet Benest/Houmet Ben√™t, Houmet Paradis and Houmet Hommetol (Omptolle). Although Victor Hugo suggests that they were heavily eroded by quarrying (which was certainly true in the case of Crevichon off Herm), Victor Coysh disagrees saying: Victor Hugo Victor Hugo who wrote about many of the Channel Islands in his books, described Les Houmets, in his work The Toilers of the Sea (Les Travailleurs de la mer). Gilliat, the main character lives on Houmet Paradis: :\\"This house was called the B√ª de la Rue. It was situated on the point of a tongue of land, or rather of rock, that made a little separate harbour in the creek of Houmet Paradis. The water was very deep here. This house was all alone on the point, almost off the land, with just enough land for a small garden. The high tides sometimes inundated the garden. Between the port of St. Sampson and the creek of Houmet Paradis rises a steep hill, surmounted by the block of towers covered with ivy, and known as Vale Castle, or the Ch√¢teau de l‚ÄôArchange; so that, at St. Sampson, the B√ª de la Rue was shut out from sight...\\" Moreover, this house had some very nasty inhabitants besides Gilliat, :\\"The country people told how, towards the close of the great Revolution, a woman, bringing with her a little child, came to live in Guernsey. She was an Englishwoman; at least, she was not French. She had a name which the Guernsey pronunciation and the country folks‚Äô bad spelling had finally converted into 'Gilliatt.'...the house of the B√ª de la Rue was haunted at this period. For more than thirty years no one had inhabited it. It was falling into ruins. The garden, so often invaded by the sea, could produce nothing. Besides noises and lights seen there at night- time, the house had this mysterious peculiarity: any one who should leave there in the evening, upon the mantelpiece, a ball of worsted, a few needles, and a plate filled with soup, would assuredly find in the morning the soup consumed, the plate empty, and a pair of mittens ready knitted. The house, demon included, was offered for sale for a few pounds sterling. The stranger woman became the purchaser, evidently tempted by the devil, or by the advantageous bargain. :\\"She did more than purchase the house; she took up her abode there with the child; and from that moment peace reigned within its walls. The B√ª de la Rue has found a fit tenant, said the country people. The haunting ceased. There was no longer any light seen there save that of the tallow candle of the newcomer. 'Witch‚Äôs candle is as good as devil‚Äôs torch.' The proverb satisfied the gossips of the neighbourhood... :\\"Today it would be useless to look for the cove of Houmet Paradis, for Gilliat's house and for the creek where he sheltered the boat. The B√ª de la Rue no longer exists. The little peninsula where this house stood has fallen under the pick-axe of the destroyers of the sea-cliffs and has been loaded, cart-load, by cart-load, on the vessels belonging to the dealers in rocks and granite... All this ridge of rock has been long ago taken to London.\\" The novel was written in the 1860s and set in the 1820s when the islands were still inhabited. The islets Houmet Benest/Ben√™t is about from the shore, preceded by a small rock called \\"Hommet\\" from the same root. It is triangular, and 80 √ó 50 yards (73 √ó 45 m). There is an 18th-century gun battery here, to defend against the French. The German occupation added their own, and the British another after the Germans left. The steamer Clarrie sank off Houmet Ben√™t in 1921, in the Great Roussel. Heathery Brae in 1952 tried to salvage it, but ended up being wrecked itself, and there are also the wrecks of Vixen (a brig), Rescue (a tug) and Romp (a cutter) went ashore here. It is covered in grass and brambles. Houmet Paradis, the fictional Gilliat's home, was originally known as Houmet de l'Eperquerie, as it was used for fish gutting, and drying on stands known as perques (perches). It was formerly owned by the Collas family, whose estate at Paradis, gave the islet its new name. In the 1920s, it was used for quarrying, and it was also used for grazing cattle, and has a lot of grass. In 1951 it was sold to James Watson of Newcastle upon Tyne for the sum of ¬£500 who placed the island under the stewardship of the National Trust of Guernsey. It remained within the family until 2004 when it was sold at auction by James Watson's grandson (also called James Watson) to a local consortium with the intention of maintaining the island as a nature reserve. Hommetol, more commonly called Omptolle by the Ordnance Survey etc., is used for gathering ormer. It is mostly covered in thrift.

It was the first airline to operate a regular international flight (between London and Paris). History On 5 October 1916, Aircraft Transport and Travel (AT&T;) was formed by George Holt Thomas. Using a fleet of former military Airco DH.4A biplanes, it operated relief flights between Folkestone and Ghent. On 15 July 1919, the company flew a proving flight across the English Channel, despite a lack of support from the British government. Flown by Lt. H. Shaw in an Airco DH.9 between RAF Hendon and Paris‚ÄìLe Bourget Airport, the flight took 2 hours and 30 minutes, and cost ¬£21 per passenger. On 25 August 1919, the company used DH.16s to start a regular service from Hounslow Heath Aerodrome to Le Bourget, the first regular (daily) international service in the world. The airline soon gained a reputation for reliability, despite problems with bad weather. In November 1919, it won the first British civil airmail contract. Six Royal Air Force Airco DH.9A aircraft, modified with Napier Lion engines were lent to the company from October 1919, to operate the airmail service between Hawkinge and Cologne, which Aircraft Transport and Travel took over from the RAF on 15 August 1919. In 1920, they were returned to the Royal Air Force. In February 1920, with its parent Aircraft Manufacturing Company Limited (Airco), AT&T;, also known as Airco Air Express, became part of the BSA Group. It continued operations, under the control of Frank Searle of Daimler Hire. As well as the London (Hounslow) to Paris service, AT&T; also operated a Croydon Airport to Amsterdam service on behalf of KLM. On 17 May 1920, a DH.16 (G-EALU) of AT&T; operated the first KLM service between London and Amsterdam. AT&T; continued to operate, but Daimler-BSA withdrew support, and overcome with debt in November 1920 it was placed in liquidation, and on 17 December 1920, it ran its last service.The Putnam Aeronautical Review edited by John Motum, p170 Volume one 1990 Naval Institute Press Early in 1921, its assets were purchased by Daimler and rolled with Daimler Air Hire Limited into a new company called Daimler Airway Limited which continued the services. By 1921, six companies operated a London to Paris service, three French and three British. The French airlines were receiving subsidies from the French government, and in protest the three British airlines stopped services on 28 February 1921. Legacy Through a series of takeovers and mergers, the modern-day British Airways can trace part of its legacy back to Aircraft Transport and Travel.

Ethnic breakdown Approximately 85% of the expatriate population (and 71% of the emirate's total population) was Asian (chiefly Indian, Pakistani, Filipino, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan). About 25% of the population have Iranian origin. About 3% of the total population of Dubai was categorized as \\"Western\\". In addition, 16% of the population (or 288,000 people) lived in collective labour accommodation were not identified by ethnicity or nationality, but were thought to be primarily Asian.The Changing Demographics of the UAE The median age in the emirate was about 27 years. In 2014, there were estimated to be 15.54 births and 1.99 deaths per 1,000 people. Culture Dubai has a culture that is Arabian, Emirati, and Islamic. Languages spoken Dubai's official language is Arabic, but English is the lingua franca and is more commonly used than Arabic in the daily communications between the city's residents. Malayalam, Sindhi, Sinhala, Hindi, Gujarati, Tamil, Balochi, Tagalog, Persian, Urdu, Bengali and Kurdish are also widely spoken. Religion Article 7 of the UAE's Provisional Constitution declares Islam the official state religion of the Union. The Government funds or subsidizes almost 95 percent of Sunni mosques and employs all Sunni imams; approximately 5 percent of Sunni mosques are entirely private, and several large mosques have large private endowments. The government distributes guidance on religious sermons to mosques and imams, whether Sunni or Shi'a, and monitors all sermons for political content. Shias are 15% of UAE's native population. The Shi'a minority is free to worship and maintain its own mosques. Within the UAE, Shi'a imams are government-appointed only in Dubai. Shi'a Muslims in Dubai may pursue Shi'a family law cases through a special Shi'a council rather than the Shari'a courts. Dubai has large expatriate communities of Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, Sikhs and others. Non-Muslim groups can own their own houses of worship, wherein they can practice their religion freely, by requesting a land grant and permission to build a compound. Groups that do not have their own buildings must use the facilities of other religious organizations or worship in private homes. While the UAE does not offer any federal-level method of granting official status to religious groups, the individual emirates may exercise autonomy in officially recognizing a particular religious denomination. For instance, Dubai granted legal status to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1993. Dubai is also the only emirate that has Hindu temples and a Sikh Gurdwara. In early 2001, ground was broken for the construction of several additional churches on a parcel of land in Jebel Ali donated by the government of Dubai to four Protestant congregations and a Roman Catholic congregation. Construction on the first Greek Orthodox Church in Dubai (to be called St. Mary's) began at the end of 2005. The land for the construction of the church was also donated by the government to the Greek Orthodox community of Dubai. Financial support to non-Muslim groups from the Dubai government is limited to donated land for the construction of churches and other religious facilities, including cemeteries. They are permitted to raise money from among their congregates and to receive financial support from abroad. Non-Muslim religious groups are permitted to openly advertise group functions, but proselytizing or distributing religious literature is strictly prohibited under penalty of criminal prosecution, imprisonment, and deportation for engaging in behavior offensive to Islam.

Geography Located west of Villach, the municipal area stretches along the lower Gail valley in southern Carinthia at the foot of the Villacher Alpe (Dobratsch) massif, the eastern extension of the Gailtal Alps. It comprises the cadastral communities of Kerschdorf (ƒåre≈°nje), Saak (ƒåaƒçe), and Sankt Georgen (≈†entjurij). N√∂tsch can be reached from Villach and S√ºd Autobahn (A2) via the Gailtal Stra√üe (B111) highway. In the north, a mountain roads leads up to the high valley of Bad Bleiberg. N√∂tsch station is a stop on the Gailtalbahn railway line from Arnoldstein to K√∂tschach-Mauthen. History Wasserleonburg Castle The settlement in the Duchy of Carinthia was first mentioned in a 1253 deed together with Lewenburg castle, present-day Wasserleonburg, then a fief of the Prince-Bishops of Bamberg. The area was devastated in the 1348 Friuli earthquake, which caused a massive landslide at Mt. Dobratsch and a flood of the Gail river. Wasserleonburg Castle, located high above the village of Saak, was rebuilt in the 14th century. During a series of ownership of several Villach merchant families, it was significantly enlarged in the 16th and 17th centuries, including a Renaissance courtyard with an open loggia, a Mannerist facade, and a castle chapel. Up to today, the complex is privately owned and used as a hotel; after his abdication, Edward VIII, Duke of Windsor, and his wife Wallis Simpson spent their honeymoon here from 5 June to 7 September 1937. From the early 20th century onwards, N√∂tsch temporarily was home of a group of Expressionist painters around Anton Kolig (1886‚Äì1950). The \\"N√∂tsch Circle\\" was in touch with the Hagenbund group of artists around Oskar Kokoschka, Anton Faistauer, and Egon Schiele.

Geography The municipal area lies within the Nock Mountains (Mirnock massif) north of the Drava Valley. In the southwest, the Drava River forms the boundary with the market town of Paternion. It comprises the cadastral communities of Fresach, Moosach and Tragenwinkl. Fresach has achieved the status of a Luftkurort (air spa). Diocese museum About two-thirds of the local population profess Protestantism. A former prayer house erected in 1784 and preserved in its original condition is today the seat of a museum of the Lutheran diocese in Carinthia. History Archaeological artifacts indicate a permanent settlement of the area since the Bronze Age. The Mirnock slopes were colonized by Alpine Slavs about 590, followed by Bavarian settlers in the 8th century. Part of the Imperial Duchy of Carinthia from 976, the estates were held by the local Counts of Ortenburg. A first Catholic church was erected in the 12th century, rebuilt after an Ottoman raid in 1478. The present-day Late Gothic building was finished in 1523. While the Ortenburg heritage had passed to the Austrian House of Habsburg, the majority of the local population turned Protestant in the early 16th century. Though subjected to the stern measures of the Counter-Reformation under the rule of the Inner Austrian archduke (and later emperor) Ferdinand II (1590‚Äì1637), Fresach remained a centre of Crypto-protestantism. Not until the 1781 Patent of Toleration issued by Emperor Joseph II a Protestant parish was established. The Protestant church was built in 1949‚Äì51. The community of Fresach was founded in 1849, it merged with neighbouring Moosach in 1963 to form the present-day municipality.

He quits his job at the pizzeria, sulks around the house, and makes suicidal comments. Tony and Carmela do not know how to help him. On his father's orders, A.J. goes to a party at the Bada Bing with \\"the two Jasons\\" - Jason Gervasi and Jason Parisi. As he accompanies them from one party to another, he begins to associate with a profitable sports betting business they are running at school. At one frat party, they use A.J.'s SUV to take a kid who owes them money into the woods. They pour sulfuric acid on his toes while A.J. helps hold him down. Carmela and Tony are pleased; they think A.J. is becoming more outgoing. Tony tells Dr. Melfi he was going to quit therapy for good but, \\"My son is talking suicide. So now I'm trapped here forever.\\" He becomes teary as he speaks of his children: \\"My rotten fucking putrid genes have infected my kid's soul. That's my gift to my son.\\" Tony speaks to FBI Agents Harris and Goddard about Ahmed and Muhammad, who have stopped visiting the Bada Bing, and gives them the cellphone number one of them had used. \\"That's a real prize,\\" Goddard says. Christopher and Paulie are selling stolen power tools through Chris's father-in-law's hardware store and dividing the take. However, Chris is seeing the others in the crew less than before. At a barbecue that he and Kelli host, Tony tells him that his absence from Soprano family gatherings could be seen as a lack of commitment. Chris reminds him that he is avoiding such meetings to keep his sobriety: there is always drink around. Paulie sends Little Paulie and Jason Molinaro to break into the hardware store and steal some items, which they sell to Paulie's Cuban contacts in Miami. Chris confronts Paulie and demands compensation; Paulie crudely rebuffs him. Tony brushes off his complaints. Chris finds himself increasingly sidelined in the family, with Bobby apparently taking his position in Tony's inner circle. When Little Paulie steals again from the hardware store, Chris tracks him down and throws him out of a third-floor window. He survives, but with six broken vertebrae. Paulie vandalizes Chris's landscaped front garden with his Cadillac CTS. Tony makes peace between Chris and Paulie, and the money situation is worked out. The two reconcile their differences at the Bing, where Chris drinks with Paulie to mark the occasion. Chris gets drunk and rambles about his daughter, causing Paulie to make some off-color jokes. Chris thinks everyone is laughing at him, Tony most of all, and abruptly leaves. He goes straight to J.T.'s place. But J.T. cannot help him much: he is no longer Chris's sponsor, he has work to do, and it is dangerous for him to hear the things Chris is starting to tell him. Rebuffing him, he says, \\"You're in the Mafia.\\" After a few seconds, Chris says quietly, \\"Fine\\", and begins to walk away, then he turns around and kills him with a single shot. First appearances *Jason Parisi: son of Patsy Parisi and a friend of A.J. Soprano and Jason Gervasi. He attends Rutgers University and is part of a small-time crew that runs sports book operations at his college. He and Jason Gervasi are known as \\"The Jasons\\". *Walden Belfiore: soldier in the Gervasi crew, seen at the Bada Bing! with the other mobsters. *Dr. Richard Vogel: A.J.'s psychotherapist. Deceased * \\"J.T.\\" Dolan: shot dead in the head by Christopher Moltisanti, after refusing to hear his story about the Mafia. Title reference * The episode's title refers to the song \\"Walk Like a Man\\" by Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, which is about a father telling his son to get over a woman who left him. Tony tries to pull A.J. out of his depression over the breakup with Blanca. Frankie Valli himself formerly had a role in the series as New York capo Rusty Millio, and an earlier episode (\\"Big Girls Don't Cry\\") was also named after a Valli song. * The phrase alludes to the belief that a man should be tough. A.J. should get over Blanca, Chris should get over his weaknesses for drink and drugs. In the previous episode, both Phil and Tony told Vito Jr. to be the man in his family. Production * Carl Capotorto (Little Paulie Germani) is promoted to the main cast and billed in the opening credits but only for this episode. * \\"Walk Like a Man\\" is the directorial debut of Terence Winter, a Sopranos writer and producer since the second season, who also wrote this episode. Winter, along with creator David Chase is one of only two screenwriters on the show to have both written and directed a single episode at the same time. * Georgie the bartender of Bada Bing! returns in this episode for a brief final appearance, despite having been severely abused by Tony in \\"Cold Cuts\\", which led to Georgie's resignation, and his insistence for Tony to stay away from him. He was apparently later reasoned with and convinced to come back after a pay-off from Tony. * The scene where Christopher observes mobsters laughing in slow-motion and looks for Tony's reaction in particular is similar to the scene from \\"All Happy Families...\\" where Tony observes the slowly laughing Mafiosi and gives most attention to Feech La Manna's reaction. Both Tony and Christopher seem to look for how these important people genuinely value them in the difficult-to- fake situation of immediate laughter. Connections to prior episodes * Christopher and Paulie have feuded many times in the past, most notably in episodes \\"Fortunate Son\\" when Christopher became made, \\"Second Opinion\\" when Paulie harassed Christopher and sniffed Adriana's panties, \\"Pine Barrens\\" when they got lost in the woods, \\"The Strong, Silent Type\\" when Christopher's drug intervention took place, and \\"Two Tonys\\" when Christopher had to pay for Paulie's outrageous restaurant bills. * Tony turns down Dr. Melfi's offer to recommend a therapist for A.J., saying her previous referral for Meadow was \\"incompetent,\\" referring to the psychotherapist who encouraged her to take a gap year in college and go on a trip to Europe in \\"No Show\\". Other cultural and historical references * At the start of this episode, A.J. is in the living room, watching a Tom and Jerry short, \\"Yankee Doodle Mouse\\" on TV. * Carmela quotes to AJ from In Memoriam by Alfred, Lord Tennyson: \\"better to have loved and lost\\". * A.J. is watching the movie Annapolis, when Tony comes downstairs at night. * While A.J. is switching channels, Tony spots the John Wayne movie Hellfighters. * Tony says A.J. could have died in Iraq (meaning he would have been old enough to be enlisted) when Carm protests about him going to a strip club. * Before Christopher murders J.T. Dolan, Dolan is writing a script for Law & Order. Michael Imperioli starred in five episodes of that show in a recurring role as Detective Nick Falco. * After Tony and A.J. arrive home to find Carmela and Meadow up, snacking, Carmela mentions that they stayed up to see Rachael Ray on Leno. Music * Tony sings a few lines from \\"Comfortably Numb\\" by Pink Floyd as he descends the stairs at the start of the episode. * \\"White Flag\\" by Dido is playing at the pizza parlor when A.J. watches a couple kissing and breaks down in tears. * The song playing while Tony is flirting with a stripper at the Bada Bing! is \\"Emma\\" by Hot Chocolate. * While Jason Parisi is talking to Tony at the Bada Bing!, \\"Body Burn\\" by Cubanate and \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" by Muse are played. * The song played at the first frat party is \\"Hand On the Pump\\" by Cypress Hill. * The song playing in the VIP room of the Bing when Christopher reconciles with Paulie is \\"Mood Indigo\\" by Keely Smith. * The song played at the second frat party is \\"Salt Shaker\\" by Ying Yang Twins featuring Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz. * As Christopher exits the bar, El Michel's Affair's version of Isaac Hayes' cover of \\"Walk On By\\" can be heard playing. * Tony is listening to \\"Tom Sawyer\\", by Rush, on his way home from the bar. * The song played over the end credits is \\"The Valley\\" by Los Lobos.

In 1996, the station added Howard Stern to the morning lineup. By 1999, the station had tweaked into Alternative and became known as The Rock@94.5 KLQ.

Phil discovers that the construction/demolition waste that Tony has been sending to Barone Sanitation contains asbestos. At a meeting in New York he says that he will not accept any more unless he receives a 25% cut; Tony refuses. As Christopher drives him back to Newark, Tony admits he may have to yield, but the waste is eventually dumped into a lake. Chris is restless; Tony begins to look at him carefully. Their car drifts into the opposite lane, then swerves sharply to avoid an approaching car. They go off the road in a severe rollover crash. Tony exits the wreckage in pain but with only minor injuries. Chris, who was not wearing a seatbelt, is seriously injured, with internal bleeding. He manages to tell Tony to call a taxi as he would not pass a drug test. Tony begins to call for help, but desists after noticing the baby seat in Chris's car. He pinches Chris's nose shut so that he cannot breathe, and he chokes to death on his own blood. Tony dreams that he tells Dr. Melfi that he killed Chris, Pussy, and Tony B. During his actual session, he recalls Chris as a liability and an embarrassment, and says he resents having to feign remorse in front of his family. At the wake, he is disgusted by the display of sorrow. He and Carmela also make an appearance at the wake of Paulie's adoptive mother Nucci, who has died of a stroke; Paulie is angered by the poor attendance. Tony decides to get away to Las Vegas. He meets Sonya, a stripper who was Chris's mistress. They have sex, smoke marijuana, and take peyote. Playing roulette, he has a winning streak. He mumbles, \\"He's dead,\\" and collapses on the casino floor laughing. With Sonya he watches the sunrise over the Red Rock Canyon.

References to prior episodes * Tony and Phil mention the Barone Sanitation sale, which happened in \\"The Fleshy Part of the Thigh.\\" * Tony has been involved in a number of car accidents in the past, and, as in this episode, was not harmed seriously in any of them. He crashed his truck when escaping hitmen in \\"Isabella,\\" crashed it when passing out from a panic attack in \\"Guy Walks into a Psychiatrist's Office...,\\" and, in \\"Irregular Around the Margins\\", when a wild animal runs in front of an Escalade during a nighttime ride, Tony and Adriana flip the truck and it is totalled. * In the pilot episode, when Christopher is first introduced, he is wearing a baseball cap and driving Tony to New York City. Right before he dies, he is wearing a baseball cap and driving Tony back from New York. According to an article in TV Guide, Michael Imperioli states that he does not know if this is intentional or a coincidence. * Christopher dies in large part due to his drug addiction (it both contributed to him crashing the truck, as he was intoxicated, and as one of the motives for his murder by Tony). Christopher struggled with his drug addiction for many years, most notably since the trip to Naples, Italy, seen in the Season 2 episode \\"Commendatori\\", where he picked up the habit of injecting heroin from the Italian gangster Tanno. Following the drug intervention in \\"The Strong, Silent Type\\" (Season 4) and his stay in rehab, Christopher's life was marked with periods of being clean and relapses after particularly stressful experiences. Additionally, in \\"The Strong, Silent Type,\\" Tony asks Junior for advice on how he should deal with Christopher, after having learned of his addiction. Junior tells him that he should be \\"put out of his misery,\\" as it used to be done by the mob in the old days. * In \\"The Strong, Silent Type\\", when Tony discovers during the intervention that Christopher accidentally sat on and suffocated Adriana's dog Cosette, he remarks that he \\"ought to suffocate\\" Christopher. Coincidentally, Christopher dies suffocating on his own blood as Tony smothers him. * In \\"Long Term Parking,\\" in one of his rants about Tony to Adriana, Christopher says: \\"That‚Äôs the guy, Adriana. My uncle Tony. The guy I‚Äôm going to hell for.\\" In \\"From Where to Eternity\\" (Season 2) he believed that he went to hell when clinically dead. * Right after the scene when Christopher's death is confirmed to Carmela, Tony awakes suddenly from a dream of Kelli hearing the news to the sound of a crow cawing, just prior to Silvio and Paulie's entering Tony's room to offer condolences. Christopher saw a crow at his making ceremony initiating him into the mafia in \\"Fortunate Son\\", which he interpreted as a bad omen. * Carmela tells Tony that it was Christopher who comforted her in the hospital when Tony got shot by Junior (\\"Join the Club\\"). * At the end of the episode, Tony sees a flash of light over the canyon with the sunrise, and shouts, \\"I get it!\\" This may be the same flash of light he sees (but looks away from) in his hotel room during his coma at the end of \\"Join the Club\\". * In \\"Chasing It\\", Carlo relates to Tony the Twilight Zone episode, \\"A Nice Place to Visit\\", in which a dead gangster, Rocky Valentine, finds himself unable to lose when gambling and able to have any woman or any other pleasure he desires. Originally, he believes himself in Heaven, until it is revealed he is actually in Hell. In this episode, Tony finds himself in a similar situation while in Las Vegas, winning at roulette and having sex while high on peyote. Also, at one point during this trip, he encounters a flashing red devil logo on a slot machine.

Geography The municipal area is situated in a valley of the Gailtal Alps, stretching from the Drava River up to Lake Weissensee. It comprises the cadastral communities Stockenboi, Tragail, Wiederschwing, and Ziebl. History About 600 the valley was settled by Romanised Celts backing away from the migration of Alpine Slavs moving up the Drava Valley. Part of the Upper Carinthian Lurngau, the estates from about 1135 were held by the local Counts of Ortenburg. After the extinction of the Ortenburg dynasty in 1418, their inheritance passed to the Counts of Celje and finally to the Habsburg dukes of Carinthia in 1456. In 1518, at the behest of the Habsburg ruler Maximilian I, Stockenboi and its extended forests were merged with neighbouring Paternion into an autonomous lordship (Herrschaft), originally held by the House of Dietrichstein. In 1599 it was acquired by the Khevenh√ºller noble family which however had to emigrate in the course of the Counter-Reformation in 1629. After the Revolutions of 1848, the communities of Stockenboi, Wiederschwing and Ziebl emerged from the former lordship. The present-day municipality was established in 1865.

They supplied luxury items: local goods in short supply and in particular foreign goods. The Tuzex vouchers were effectively an unofficial parallel currency. History The Czechoslovak koruna (crown) was a soft currency, that is, not exchangeable for other currencies outside the country. In 1948 shops were established under the name Darex to sell goods to foreigners for foreign (hard) currency only (based on the earlier Torgsin shops in the Soviet Union). Later, these became open to ordinary citizens, but not for crowns. In 1950, to speed up transactions and limit fraud, foreign currency was first converted into Darex vouchers in values of crowns. In 1957 the PZO (Foreign Trade Enterprise) Tuzex (a contraction of tuzemsk√Ω export [domestic export]) was founded in order to get convertible foreign currency into the country. This currency came directly from foreigners visiting the country, but also from relatives or citizens working abroad, who could send currency to friends and family to buy items in Tuzex, with Tuzex vouchers instead of Darex ones. The vouchers could not be re-exchanged for foreign currency and were valid for a limited time. (The state would convert unused vouchers back to normal currency at a rate of 2 crowns per Tuzex crown, a fraction of their effective purchasing power.) The first shop was established in Prague on Ryt√≠≈ôsk√° street, and the next in Bratislava. In 1961 there were 14 shops, rising to 170 in 1988. However, the fact that otherwise unavailable luxuries could be purchased led to an unofficial or grey market (technically illegal but tolerated) buying Tuzex vouchers with Czechoslovak currency at a high premium, typically 5 to 1. The Darex and Tuzex vouchers were colloquially known as bony. The hustlers or spivs who would offer sell them on the street (close to Tuxex shop) were known as veksl√°ci (from german wechsel - exchange) A 1987 film with title: Bony a klid (vouchers and tranquility as a reference to Bonnie and Clyde) reflects the daily lives of petty criminals dealing with the vouchers. Following the Velvet Revolution in 1989 and the reformation of the country, citizens were able to travel abroad more freely and to legally deal with other currencies. In addition, improved domestic economy and more imports meant that Tuzex sales declined. The sale of Tuzex vouchers ceased on 30 June 1992. As well as running the shops, the Tuzex corporation had activities in various countries in order to trade Czechoslovak goods and obtain supplies for the shops. This continued for a while after the closure of the shops in 1992 to complete contracts and for liquidation of the assets. Tuzex vouchers Tuzex voucher for 5 crowns Tuzex vouchers were originally issued in values of 0.50, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 crowns and later 500 crowns. However, from 1958 there was a voucher of 71.50 crowns, being issued in exchange for US$10. Tuzex also issued vouchers to foreigners to buy motor fuel. In 1988 the first payment card in Czechoslovakia was introduced to allow cashless purchases at Tuzex stores. Goods Display of a Tuzex counter in the Museum of Communism, Czech Republic Initially Tuzex stocked export-quality Czechoslovak products (e.g. fine chocolate, alcohol) at what would be a good price for foreigners, and Western products such as cigarettes. Better quality/style clothing became important, with Tuzex clothes becoming an indicator of success for some people. The clothes selection eventually included jeans (the first being the Italian brand Rifle in 1968) as the epitome of western or \\"Texas\\" clothing, white goods, and motor cars. The advantage in many cases was that such goods were available immediately instead of a long wait of possibly years. In 1988 Tuzex had 170 shops which sold $250 million worth of goods, two-thirds western imports, and one-third export- quality items from Czechoslovakia.

The Harding Band Building, the first dedicated building for a University Band Department, was named for him. His full-length portrait painted by Earl Bradbury in 1950 hangs in the Harding Band Building. Early life Albert Austin Harding was born February 10, 1880 in Georgetown, Illinois, the son of Conway A. and Jennie Stewart Harding. Unfortunately, Jennie died shortly after his birth, and Conway moved his son to Paris, Illinois, to live with his maternal grandparents, Vincent and Mary Stewart. He lived with them until the age of 10.Sousa Archives and Center for American Music. A. Austin Harding Papers, 1895-1958 After their deaths in February 1890 he went to live with his paternal grandmother, Mrs. Adelia Austin Harding, and her brother Wallace Austin in the Austin house in Paris. He lived there until he was 21.Burford, Cary Clive (1952) We‚Ä≤re Loyal to You, Illinois Danville, Ill.: The Interstate, pp.51‚àí 57 In 1894 at age 14 Harding bought his first cornet, a French Jaubert for only nine or ten dollars. This cornet was probably the cheapest type of cornet available at that time and was nicknamed \\"Jawbreakers\\". Recognizing beauty in the instrument, he quickly mastered it and moved on to the fife. By the age of 16, he had also learned the piccolo. He began his musical career as the bugler for the Boys Brigade in Paris. Since Paris High School did not yet have a band, he became bugler for the Paris High School Cadets. Also, he and some of his school mates formed a band called the \\"Bum Notes Band\\". Each member of the band played an unfamiliar instrument so Harding chose the baritone, a larger brass instrument having the same valve fingering as the cornet. While still in high school he joined and eventually led the Paris Beacon Drum and Bugle Corps, named after the local newspaper the Paris Beacon. In this group he played the fife and the bugle. The corps traveled by train to Canton, Ohio in 1896 to play at a political campaign rally for presidential candidate William McKinley. At the age of 17, he joined the Paris Concert Band. Before graduating from high school in 1899 he became the leader of the band, and later succeeded W. D. Wooley as band director. Meanwhile, his career as an independent musician was thriving, and he was invited to participate in many area musical groups including marching bands, dance bands, and orchestras. After high school, he joined the Illinois National Guard, where he was company bugler, battalion bugler, and regimental bugler. For the most part, he was stationed at Camp Lincoln in Springfield, Illinois. Career as a student In 1902, Harding began attending the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. Almost immediately, he joined the University Military Band playing cornet and the University Orchestra playing bassoon. He was outranked in seniority by two musicians in the cornet section of the band: Carl Ginzel and E.J. Piggot. In 1904 he joined the newly formed chapter of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity where he roomed with DeLoss Funk of Funk's Grove in McLean County, Illinois. DeLoss had an automobile and was in great demand on campus because of it.Burford 1952, pp.50, 103, 105 In the spring of 1905 Harding was offered a position as Teacher of Band Instruments and Assistant Director of the band by Professor Frederick Locke Lawrence, head of the School of Music. At the time, he was a junior in the College of Engineering planning to become a municipal and sanitary engineer. He considered the band position only temporary. He didn't finish his engineering degree, but he did receive a Bachelor of Music degree in 1916. Since the School of Music was growing rapidly, Professor Lawrence had less time available to spend with the band. Thus, Harding's responsibilities in the band gradually increased and beginning in September 1905 Professor Lawrence never raised a baton over the band again. Harding led all rehearsals, provided all band instruction, and did all individual instruction on band instruments after the fall tryouts. On 3 March 1906, he conducted his first concert in the Armory (now the Kenney Gym Annex) on Springfield Avenue, appearing on the concert program as Conductor.Sixteenth Annual Concert of the University of Illinois Military Band at the Armory Saturday March 3rd, 1906, 8:00 P.M.

Items in the student newspaper announcing the upcoming concert. Director of bands In 1907 Harding was appointed Director of Bands after two years of conducting the band. With this appointment the University of Illinois became the \\"first university to create a distinct band department under a director of bands\\".Library Gateway: University Archives. Harding, Albert Austin (1880-1958), He was listed as both conductor and director of the Military Band for the first time in the program for the 1908 annual spring concert. Later he earned a full professorship in music, becoming the first band director to do this on an American campus. On the evening of 26 April 1911 the Military Band played the first Twilight Concert on the quadrangle in front of the University Auditorium (now Foellinger Auditorium).‚Ä≥Initial Twilight Concert on Campus Grounds Tonight‚Ä≥. Daily Illini (University of Illinois) 26 April 1911, p.1. These popular concerts were started by Director Harding following a request by the university president Edmund J. James that the band do something more for the cultural life of the university. The spring series of Twilight Concerts in April and May continued through 1984. Summer session Twilight Concerts in June and July played by the Summer Band on the Illini Union terrace continue to the present. On Commencement Day, 11 June 1913, Harding married Margaret Rogers, a high school friend from Paris. He was 33 and she was 32. They had one daughter, Jane Austin Harding. As a student Harding had played in several off- campus organizations to earn money. He played at the Walker Opera House and joined the Knights of Pythias Band, eventually becoming its conductor. In 1910 he became director of the Urbana Commercial Club Band for its summer concert series. Because many players, including some of Harding's own university students, played in both these bands, he merged the two into an Associated Musicians Band in 1913 to play concerts and local events. Harding conducted this band for several years. From 1918 to 1931 he conducted the University Orchestra in addition to his duties as Director of Bands. Frederic B. Stiven, director of the School of Music, replaced him as the University Orchestra conductor in 1931. By 1919, following World War I, the bands had expanded to three organizations. The first band was designated the Concert Band and was increased to 100 members from every college in the university plus a few faculty members who qualified and wanted to play. Military duties were taken over by the First and Second Regiment Bands conducted by the band assistants. These two bands also functioned as concert groups. From 1926 onward the band assistants also took over drills and performances of the football band, the Marching Illini. In July 1922 there was sufficient interest among students, faculty and townspeople that a Summer Band was organized at the university to play Twilight Concerts similar to those given in the spring.‚Ä≥Summer Bandsmen Practice Tomorrow‚Ä≥. Daily Illini 2 July 1922, p.3; ‚Ä≥Join the Band... The summer band... will see its second season this year‚Ä≥. 22 June 1923 This band has continued relatively unchanged since that time. When Harding became conductor there was very little original music written for band by outstanding composers. Published concert music consisted mainly of transcriptions of orchestral music for small bands of limited ability and instrumentation, so he began to transcribe brilliant, colorful orchestral compositions to fit the instrumentation and ability of his band. These transcriptions were done under an agreement with publishers that they be used exclusively by the University of Illinois bands and not be copied or loaned out to other bands. The list grew to more than 150 handwritten manuscripts by the time he retired in 1948.‚Ä≥Harding, UI's First Band Leader, Was Self-Taught‚Ä≥. The News-Gazette (Champaign, Ill.) 14 April 1967 He continued to increase the dimensions of the band program by adding concert band music and his own transcriptions of symphonic and chamber pieces to performances at ceremonies and sporting events. He also enforced professionalism within the bands. The Concert Band became unique, especially because of his interest in unusual instruments. Not only did he utilize typical band instruments but in 1924 he added many unusual instruments such as the basset horn, saxonet, B-flat bass sarrusophone, E-flat bass sarrusophone, CC contra-bass sarrusophone, terz flute, A-flat flute, musette, valve trombone, tenor antoniophone, bass antoniophone, bellstedtromba, bass cornophone and ophicleide. John Philip Sousa called the Concert Band \\"the world's greatest college band.\\" The Concert Band became well known away from the campus through annual spring tours and weekly radio broadcasts that were well established by 1927. Band concerts in the University Auditorium were popular and well attended by students, faculty and townspeople. The Concert Band always played a formal concert for the June graduation festivities in addition to playing for the Commencement ceremonies. Harding emphasized the importance of sight reading in his bands. In addition to the dozen or so selections prepared for the spring concert the Concert Band would read and maintain a large repertoire of music to be taken on tour. In 1931 tour audiences could select encores from a list of 87 compositions that the band members carried with them for tour concerts.University of Illinois Concert Band Repertoire‚ÄîSpring, 1931.

On 29 October 1933 the Concert Band made an all expenses paid trip to Chicago to play at the Century of Progress International Exposition, the World‚Ä≤s Fair. The band played a one-hour concert in the Hall of States and another in the Hall of Science. They returned home the same day.‚Ä≥University Concert Band plays at Century of Progress‚Ä≥. Daily Illini 31 October 1933, p. 1 While Harding was director, the Concert Band had many guest conductors. The most legendary was John Philip Sousa, also known as the \\"March King\\".Library of Congress. John Philip Sousa On March 20, 1930, the band performed a \\"Complimentary Concert\\". Harding conducted the first half of the concert, and Sousa conducted the second half. Among the works Harding conducted were those composed by Saint-Sa√´ns, Respighi, Haydn Wood, Glazunov, and Rimsky-Korsakov. Sousa then conducted various works including a \\"Symposium of Marches by the March King\\" which consisted of \\"The University of Illinois\\", \\"Semper Fidelis\\", and \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\". Other guest conductors at various times were Edwin Franko Goldman, Henry Fillmore, Frank Simon, Harold Bachman, Guy Holmes, and Victor Grabel. Harding also started the Illinois Band Clinic. According to John Grashel, Ph.D., the Illinois Band Clinic was a precursor to the Midwest Clinic, now the Mid-West International Band and Orchestra Clinic held annually in Chicago, Illinois.Grashel, John. Illinois Music Educator, THE MIDWEST CLINIC (1946-2007): Sixty Years of Participation by Illinois School bands, Orchestras, and Jazz Ensembles., Spring 2009, Vol. 69 Issue 3 p:77-80, http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=3&hid;=107&sid;=4956f996-7a4a-4bb9-b48d-5798bd1b12c4%40sessionmgr115 In 1929 the idea of a clinic for high school band directors grew out of the annual High School Teachers Conference held at the university. Harding and his assistants organized the first clinic held on 9‚Äì10 January 1930. Along with demonstrations of contest music played by the university bands there were meetings and discussions of band topics.Burford 1952, pp. 529‚Äì550 The clinics were discontinued in the 1950s. In 1955 they were replaced with the Festival of Concert Band Music, a two‚Äìday series of formal concerts by the three university bands. In January 1945 Margaret Harding was bedridden. The 16th annual band clinic was in session at the time, so Clarence Sawhill, Assistant Director of Bands, conducted the band clinic. On January 16, 1945, Margaret died. She was survived by her husband and their only child Jane Austin Harding. After 41 years of being the director of bands, Harding retired in 1948 at the age of 68. His assistant Mark Hindsley became Interim Director and was appointed Director in 1950, a position he held until his retirement in 1970. Relationship with Sousa Harding and Sousa shared a \\"very close personal and professional relationship\\". According to archivist Phyllis W. Danner, the Sousa band was performing in Champaign, Illinois, in 1906 when they met at a reception. A \\"mentoring relationship developed between the two‚Ä¶ and the friendship between the two lasted until Sousa's death nearly three decades later\\".Gill, Michael. Humanities. A Nation on the March, November/December 1997, Volume 18, Number 6 Sousa planned on giving the university the materials from his band library as a \\"gesture of his high esteem\\" for Harding and his band. However, this was not written in Sousa‚Ä≤s will when he died in 1932. In order to obtain the collection, Harding wrote letters to the Sousa family and their attorneys. After a few months the family agreed, and Ray Dvorak, the band assistant at the time, traveled to New York City to retrieve the collection. Dvorak sorted through the materials in Sousa's band library and \\"oversaw the packing and shipping of 39 trunks and two boxes containing 9,700 pounds of music and other materials\\". These materials are now housed at the Sousa Archives and Center for American Music, which is open to the public. Death and accomplishments Harding had been plagued with an illness after his retirement. On December 3, 1958 Albert Austin Harding died in Champaign, Illinois. The Band Building had been dedicated in March of that year. Harding served as the treasurer of the American Bandmasters Association for several years. From 1937-1938, he was the ABA's President. In 1956, he succeeded John Philip Sousa and Edwin Franko Goldman as Honorary Life President. For the College Band Directors National Association, he became an Honorary Life President, and he was also a founding member of the Alpha Xi chapter of the Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia. He received Honorary Doctor of Music degrees from Phillips University, Enid, Oklahoma and Davidson College, Davidson, North Carolina, in 1936. The \\"A.A. Harding March\\" composed by Carl Mader and F.M. Bierow in Harding's honor was published by the Columbia Band Instruments Company in Chicago. Harding was uncomfortable playing a march with his name as the title so he cut the titles off the band parts and always referred to it as \\"March number 20\\". When the Summer Band played the march on the 27 June 2019 Twilight Concert the band parts for number 20 still had no titles.Untitled band part with library stamp \\"CONCERT BAND 20\\" published by Columbia Band Instruments Co., 1217 W. Monroe St., Chicago As Director of Bands Harding transcribed more than 150 orchestral compositions for his concert bands. Most of these remain unpublished.

Also, the band library utilizes five rooms; the Sousa Archives and Center for American Music and the Carl Busch Instrument Collection occupy five more rooms.

The Reef is 46 cm thick and bounded by thin chromite seams or stringers. The composition consists predominantly of cumulate rocks, including leuconorite, anorthosite, chromitite, and melanorite.  Composition  The UG2 Reef, the composition of which is relatively consistent throughout the BIC, is rich in chromite. However, the UG2 Reef lacks the Merensky's gold, copper and nickel by-products, though its reserves may be almost twice those of the Merensky Reef. Overall, the Merensky Reef is observed to be a lower layer composed of anorthosite or norite with a thin layer of chromitite over top. In addition, there is commonly a layer overlying both composed of feldspathic pyroxenite. Chromitite layers occur commonly in large mafic layered intrusions. A current theory suggests chromitites form as a result of introduction and mixing of chemically primitive magma with a more evolved magma, which results in supersaturation of chromite in the mixture and the formation of a nearly monomineralic layer on the magma chamber floor. The leading theory regarding the formation of the Merensky reef is that of crystals originating from a main magma source accumulated and cooled as the magma rose resulting in crystallization.Mathez, E,A. (1995). MagmaUc metasomaUsm and formation of the Merensky reef, Bushveld Complex. Contrib Mineral Petrol 119, 277-286. Yet the nature of crystallization is complex.  Layers  The Merensky Reef is constructed by 5 different layers. The first layer is mottled anorthosite which is pyroxene oikocrysts and is described as dark colored bands. The mottled anorthosite is composed of traces of quartz, titanite and apatite minerals. The second layer is Merensky chromitites which are highly irregular grains of basal chromitite. The third layer is similar to the second layer with Merensky chromitites, however the basal chromitite is compact and smaller in size. The fourth layer is Merensky pegmatite and is composed of coarse- grained silicate with an approximate thickness of 2.6 cm thick. In the fourth layer, chromite is sparse and sulfides are present. The fifth layer is Merensky melanorite and is a fine-grained chalcopyrite, quartz and feldspar rich matrix.  Whole-rock chemistry  Sulfidic chromitite from Merensky Reef (sample size: 45 mm) The Merensky Reef has a high concentration of chromitites. However, the chromitites differ from one another in their levels of iridium, ruthenium, rhodium and platinum present. There is reported trace element enrichment shown by arsenic, cadmium, tin and tellurium. The Merensky Reef is similar to the Platreef because of the presence of primitive mantle, layered intrusions and levels of nickel and copper. The Merensky-type reef has been separated into two categories, the orthomagmatic and the hydromagmatic. The orthomagmatic group is composed of platinum group element mineralization. The hydromagmatic group is composed of platinum group element mineralization to volatile-rich fluids separating from a solid cumulate pile.  Crystallization  There are several theories that suggest how the crystallization on the Merensky Reef occurred. The first accepted hypothesis of the Merensky Reef suggests the chromite crystallization originated from hybrid melts and significant lateral mixing of new and resident magma. In detail, the first hypothesis suggests the high of PGE concentrations were a result from the sulfide and silicate melt. The sulfide melt plays an important role in this hypothesis because the sulfide melt is dense and the settling of the melt through the magma column to the floor of the chamber allowed such mixing to occur. One theory suggests the chromite crystallization originated from hybrid melts and lateral mixing. There is another theory that suggests the crystallization originated from chromite and sulfide droplets. However, there is another theory the crystallization originated from emplaced magma merging with roof-rock melts. In detail of the theory of roof-rock melts, there was contaminated between the new magma and silica-rich resident melt. The contaminated resulted in chromite and PGM crystallization because the chromite grains attracted the PGM crystals. After crystallization, the crystals were carried in the collapsing margins and formed the layers of chromitite and PGE.  History  The Bushveld Complex chromitites were first detected by Hall and Humphrey. The initial recovery of platinum in South Africa took place on several of the large East Rand gold mines and the first separate platinum mine was a short lived venture near Naboomspruit that worked very patchy quartz reefs. The discovery of the Bushveld Igneous Complex deposits was made in 1924 by a Lydenburg district farmer, A F Lombaard. It was recorded to be approximately 80 kilometers in length.[Geology for South African Students. CNA Ltd South Africa]Platinum Group Metal Mines In South Africa 2007, S A Dept of Minerals and energy This was an alluvial deposit but its importance was recognized by Hans Merensky whose prospecting work discovered the primary source in the Bushveld Igneous Complex and traced it for several hundred kilometres by 1930. Extensive mining of the Reef didn't take place until an upsurge in the demand for platinum group metals used in exhaust pollution control in the 1950s, made exploitation economically feasible. Extraction of metals from the UG2 chromitite could only take place in the 1970s with major advances in metallurgy. The first mine concentrated on the extraction of chrome-rich UG2 platinum on the reef and was named the Lonmin mine.

Ashton MBE (1917‚Äì2008) was an English writer, lecturer, local historian and educationist active in Sweden. He was the former chairman of the British Factory. He resided in Gothenburg, Sweden, with his Swedish wife Torborg. Biography John Rowland Ashton was born in Manchester, England, in 1917. In his early life he studied law in London. He was employed by the Gothenburg Education Authority as English language teaching consultant in 1952, a post he held until 1982. During this time he co-authored several English language teaching series, published in Sweden and Norway. He also edited English texts for older students in Sweden, Germany and Holland. In 1957 he pioneered an English language teaching series on local television which he wrote and presented. He has also been active in the social life of the British community in Gothenburg being the vice-chairman of the English school (1960‚Äì1979) and a member of the English Church (St. Andrew‚Äôs) Council (1974‚Äì1998).

The book tells the fascinating story of why the Scots and English settled in Gothenburg and how a number of Scottish and English merchant families have contributed to the economic and cultural development of the city. Trade across the North Sea, especially in iron-bars and timber, has for nearly three hundred years been of vast importance in the growth of the port of Gothenburg. The influence of this trade on the commercial and social life of Gothenburg is reflected in that the city is sometimes called Little London. The story of the lives and livelihoods of members of the Barclays, David Carnegie, Chalmers, Sir William Chambers, Chapman, James Dickson, John Hall, Gibson and Keiller families ‚Äì to name but a few ‚Äì is told against a backdrop of major historical events in Europe. And that the influence of these families was positive and strong is indicated by the naming of streets in the city after them. In the 17th century, the supplying of hemp, tar, masts, deals and iron to the Royal Navy was a profitable trade for the Scottish merchants in the port of Gothenburg. In 1731, the Swedish East India Company was founded and owed its initial success to the experience in the China trade of Colin Campbell. Events overseas involved Gothenburg in Jacobite politics and in the Napoleonic Wars. The Scottish and English influence in the city was strong and beneficial in the 19th century.

It has distinctive ears, long and with a distinctive fold. It hunts above woodland, often by day, and mostly for moths. In captivity, it has also been recorded to eat small lizards. It is extremely similar to the more common brown long-eared bat, and was only distinguished in the 1960s, but has a paler belly.  Biology and ecology  Its main foraging habitats are lowland meadows and marshes. It locates its insect prey via echolocation. The frequencies used by this bat species for echolocation lie between 18‚Äì45 kHz, have most energy at 28 kHz and have an average duration of 5.8 ms.  Distribution  Europe (without the Scandinavian Peninsula), Asia Minor, the Caucasus, Iran, Afghanistan, Kashmir and South Africa. Plecotus austriacus - Science for Nature Foundation  Conservation  It is currently listed as near-threatened by the IUCN. It has a large geographic range and it is considered relatively common. In most of the countries where it is found, it is protected from intentional harm by legislation. While Continental European distributions are not threatened, a 2013 study found this species was close to extinction in the United Kingdom. One possible reason for its decline in the UK is the loss of foraging habitat. It is currently a focus within the Back from the Brink conservation project which aims to increase foraging habitat around known roost sites.https://naturebftb.co.uk/the-projects/grey-long- eared-bat/ This species may also be threatened by climate change in Southern Europe. One researcher noted, \\"long-lived, slow-reproducing species with smaller population sizes are not likely to be able to adapt to future climate change fast enough through the spread of new mutations arising in the population.\\" In the future, it may be necessary for humans to relocate bats to suitable areas as climate changes.

The waterfalls, formed by the recycle station water, are located northeast of Antalya. They end where the waters of the Lower D√ºden Falls drop off a rocky cliff directly into the Mediterranean Sea. A group of D√ºden Waterfalls consists of two waterfalls, Upper D√ºden Waterfalls and Lower D√ºden Waterfalls.

The waterfalls is located in D√ºden Park.  D√ºdenba≈üƒ± Waterfall karstic system  At the 28th and 30th kilometre markers () of the old route from Antalya-Burdur (which goes through D√∂≈üemealtƒ± town), two big karstic sources appear. These sources, Kƒ±rkg√∂zler and Pƒ±narba≈üƒ±, merge after a short flow and disappear into Bƒ±yƒ±klƒ± Sinkhole. Some of the sinkholes can swallow a river or lake. In this region, the Suƒüla (Konya) big sinkhole and the Bƒ±yƒ±klƒ± sinkhole output . This quantity is the output of Kƒ±rkg√∂z and Pƒ±narba≈üƒ± springs at inundation. The water, which disappears at Bƒ±yƒ±klƒ± Sinkhole, travels underground and comes out again at Varsak pit. After a very short fall, it disappears again from the other end. The water which disappears at Varsak goes underground for 2 km (1.2 mi) and comes out again at D√ºdenbasi, by pressure made by a syphon. The water which falls from D√ºdenbasi is the water coming from Kepez Hydroelectrical Complex. A regulator built in front of the Bƒ±yƒ±klƒ± Sinkhole directs the waters of Kƒ±rkg√∂zler and Pƒ±narba≈üƒ± into a canal to the Kepez Hydroelectric Plant, where a pressure pipe carries it to a balancing funnel and drops it over the plant's turbines. The water from the plant's discharge unit is brought to D√ºdenba≈üƒ± again by a long canal, where it forms artificial cascades. From there the amount of water is that of a large river. Seven irrigation trenches distribute the water to land north-east of Antalya. After D√ºdenbasi, the waters of D√ºden√ßay separate into a number of streams and finally, east of Antalya, cascade from a platform into the Mediterranean. A park surrounds these waterfalls.

He offers a compromise about the asbestos removal, but Phil rejects it out of hand. In response Tony takes Phil's men Coco and Butchie off the payroll from another construction project. They viciously beat up the foreman and steal his wallet when he tells them. A drunken Coco notices Meadow in a restaurant. He touches her cheek and makes some lewd comments. She reluctantly tells her father. Enraged, Tony finds Coco and pistol-whips and curb stomps him. This assault opens a deep rift between the Soprano and Lupertazzi families. Little Carmine tells Tony that he will once again broker a truce meeting with Phil, who has shut down one of their joint construction projects. Tony admits, \\"I lost it, bad timing.\\" But Phil refuses to meet with them when they arrive at his home; from behind a second-floor window he spews profanities as they walk away. FBI Agents Harris and Goddard visit Satriale's and ask Tony to look at some photos. Tony identifies Ahmed and Muhammad. When Dr. Melfi sees Dr. Kupferberg, he shares with her the results of a recent study which has shown that sociopaths are not helped by talk therapy but rather only further enabled by it, perhaps even \\"sharpening their skills as con men\\" in the process. Meadow reveals that her new boyfriend is Patrick Parisi, Patsy's eldest son, and that, inspired by him, she has decided to enter law school. A.J. remains depressed; moved by W. B. Yeats' apocalyptic poem ‚ÄúThe Second Coming‚Äù, he prepares to kill himself. He sits on the edge of the swimming-pool with a cinder-block tied by a rope to one leg. He pulls a plastic bag over his head and jumps in. But the rope is too long to keep him submerged. He struggles: he can neither drown nor save himself. Tony happens to come home. Hearing shouts, he goes out. He runs and jumps, wearing suit and tie, into the pool. He saves A.J. and hauls up the cinder-block. At first he is shocked and furious, but A.J. is sobbing; he cradles his son in his lap, saying \\"Come on, baby, you're all right, baby.\\" A.J. is put on Valium and admitted to a psychiatric ward. At a session with his therapist and his parents, he speaks of resentments going back to 2nd grade, and quotes his grandmother at the end of her life: \\"It's all a big nothing.\\" This session occurs just after Tony's assault on Coco; as he listens, he notices one of Coco's bloody teeth in the cuff of his pant leg. Tony and Carmela both feel guilty about the attempted suicide, and each blames the other. Tony scornfully rejects Dr. Melfi's suggestion that A.J. was calling for help and, at some level, knew the rope was too long. \\"He could just be a fucking idiot. Historically, that's been the case.\\" He tells her about his insight on peyote: \\"I saw ‚Ä¶ that this and everything we experience is not all there is ‚Äì there's something else.\\" Production * Arthur Nascarella (Carlo Gervasi) is promoted to the main cast and billed in the opening credits but only for this episode. References to prior episodes * During their fight, Carmela angrily mentions the incident when Tony's father accidentally shot his mother through her beehive hairdo, as told to her by Janice in \\"Soprano Home Movies\\"; Tony hates the anecdote because it makes the Soprano family look \\"dysfunctional.\\" * A.J. recalls being deeply affected by Livia's comments that life is a \\"big nothing\\" and, \\"in the end . . . you die in your own arms\\" when he visited her in the Season 2 episode \\"D-Girl\\". A.J. also recalls Carmela calling him an \\"animal\\" for smoking marijuana at his confirmation, which occurred in the same episode. It is notable that in the season finale of Season 2, Tony, after waking up from the dream that he burns himself alive, says \\"It's all a big nothing... Life.\\" to Carmela. * Tony appeals to Phil to negotiate and work together, in front of all the mobsters referring to the peace-making conversation they had in the hospital after he had suffered a heart attack, which happened in \\"Kaisha.\\" * Dr. Melfi had previously quoted from Yeats' The Second Coming in \\"Cold Cuts\\", reciting two lines of the poem not heard in this episode: \\"The centre cannot hold\\" and \\"The falcon cannot hear the falconer\\". Other cultural and historical references * Tony gives Carmela an engraved Baume et Mercier watch, as a present from his trip to Vegas. The jeweler FedExed the watch after engraving it. * When Agent Harris asks Tony to look at some photos, Tony jokingly asks him if any of them are of Angelina Jolie. * Dr. Vogel mentions the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. A.J. says he watches CNN and is later seen reading the Al Jazeera website; he also mentions Indonesian mujahideen. * Meadow mentions to A.J. how funny Borat is. * As one reason to explain his constant interest in Dr. Melfi's mobster patient, Dr. Kupferberg says his father was a big Untouchables fan. * After A.J. makes disparaging remarks about the cattle industry during a family dinner, Tony exclaims, \\"Twenty years he won't crack a book; all of a sudden he's the world's foremost authority!\\"‚Äîpossibly an ironic reference to the comedian Professor Irwin Corey. * The psychiatric study Dr. Kupferberg refers to is The Criminal Personality by Drs. Stanton Samenow and Samuel Yochelson. Although a real study, it was first published in 1977, 30 years before this episode takes place, so both Dr. Kupferberg and Dr. Melfi would likely have heard of it before this episode. * Describing his peyote trip, Tony refers to \\"Roger Corman shit\\".

It closed in 1986.Hardesty, \\"Nova Studios, Part One: The Pre-Sound Years,\\" Manshots, July 1997. Genesis of the studio In 1969, Masters (then using the pseudonym \\"Robert Walters\\") began producing hardcore gay male nude magazines. By the end of the year, he was producing as many as six magazines a month.Douglas, \\"Behind the Camera: Scott Masters, Part 1,\\" Manshots, November 1997.In all, Masters produced more than 500 softcore and hardcore gay pornographic magazines, including 24 issues of In Touch for Men, from 1969 to 1977. See: Hardesty, \\"Nova Studios, Part One: The Pre-Sound Years,\\" Manshots, July 1997. In 1970, Masters produced his first film, Drilled Deep. It was a \\"loop\\" (an 8mm short film, roughly 200 feet in length, designed to run over and over in peep shows), and starred Jim Cassidy‚Äîat the time a popular underground hardcore gay porn star. To distribute his films, Masters established his first adult film business, The Stephens Agency. While Masters directed and produced films on a contract basis for distributors, he retained the right to sell the loops via direct mail. The Stephens Agency was his direct mail operation. Masters closed the distribution business in 1972 because it was unprofitable. However, he continued to direct loops, working alongside former Hollywood lighting technician and cinematographer Jim Randall. Despite a conviction in Texas in 1970 for obscenity, by 1976 Masters had directed more than 100 loops. In 1973, Masters directed his first feature- length hardcore gay adult film. The film was Greek Lightning, produced for Jaguar Productions and starring gay porn star Jimmy Hughes.Douglas, Jerry. \\"Gay Film Heritage: Jaguar Productions, Part 1,\\" Manshots, June 1996. In late 1973, Masters founded In Touch (now known as In Touch for Men), a softcore gay porn magazine. But after two years, Masters turned over management of the magazine to a third party (while retaining ownership). Nova Studios In 1976, Masters (still using the name Robert Walters) founded Nova Studios. The inspiration for the company came from a competitor's success. In 1972, Falcon Studios had opened its doors in San Francisco. Distributing its films through direct mail as well as adult bookstores, the studio was able to charge high prices. This improved the budget for Falcon's loops, leading to higher-quality films. Realizing that direct mail might be profitable again, Masters spent most of 1976 raising capital to form Nova Studios. Nova Studios' first production was Tubtricks (1976). Masters had decided to produce loops which ran to more than 400 feet, extending the film's running time to nearly 20 minutes. Tubtricks was shot in a San Francisco gay bathhouse, and featured a complex orgy at its conclusion. The film co-starred Lee Marlin and Ken Carter, both of whom would later become notable sex performers and work for important directors such as Tom DeSimone, Jack Deveau, William Higgins and Mark Reynolds. Tubtricks was a major success. Masters followed up the film with a series of wildly popular long loops: Kept After School, Beached, Tricking, Hot Lunch, Jocks, That Boy Next Door and Down on the Farm. The \\"West Coast Look\\" Under Masters, Nova Studios developed the \\"West Coast Look\\" of gay pornography. As noted in a published history of Nova Studios, the West Coast Look was a very stylized and highly planned filmmaking style. Films were like staged plays, and contained extremely linear story-telling. \\"Tight transitions\\" were inserted between each scene to add continuity and establish setting, mood, and theme. Each scene sequenced almost formulaically \\"from master shot to medium shot to close-up, with frequent returns to the master shot. (By re-establishing the overall shot so often, Walters made viewers feel that they were viewing the action from the best seat in the house, not from within the circle of action itself.)\\" The lighting was strong, and tended to eliminate shadows and expose flaws in the performers' skin. Models' hair was carefully groomed, make-up was used, and cleanliness emphasized.Hardesty, \\"Nova Studios, Part One: The Pre-Sound Years,\\" Manshots, July 1997, p. 11. Establishing gay porn tropes Nova Studios established a number of tropes now common to gay adult film: * Heavy emphasis on sexual fantasy - Nova Studios productions often featured sex in settings not generally considered \\"gay\\" at that time, such as factories, garages, locker rooms or barns. The studio focused on the fantasy of \\"sex with a straight man\\" or \\"sex between straight men,\\" and played heavily on the idea that \\"gay sex can happen where you least expect it.\\" * Gay-for-pay performers - Nova Studios films did not depict characters as gay. The personality or sexual identity of each character was left ambiguous at best, and more often decidedly heterosexual. \\"The point, above all, was to show 'hot guys having gay sex,' not gay guys having hot sex'.\\"Hardesty, \\"Nova Studios, Part One: The Pre-Sound Years,\\" Manshots, July 1997, p. 12. * Partially clothed sex - Nova Studios pioneered the idea of leaving one piece of clothing on the performers during the sex act. This usually was a pair of white athletic socks with colorful stripes on the top, a visual which became nearly ubiquitous in gay pornography until the late 1980s. Athletic shoes, work boots, cleats and even complete uniforms (such as a policeman's shirt and pants, or a football player's pads, jersey and jockstrap) would remain on the model. The concept was to continually remind the viewer of the fantasy setting in which the sex occurred. * An emphasis on youth - Although most of the models cast in Nova Studios productions were in their late 20s and early 30s, the setting and story used in the films emphasized the youth of the models. In some cases, the films implied through the use of dialogue, setting or behavior that some of the characters were under the age of 18. * Incest themes - Beginning with the film His Little Brother (produced in 1978), Nova Studios often included incest in its films. Although none of the models were, in fact, siblings, Nova Studios often gave them the same last name as their stage name to heighten the impression that the models were brothers. Other aspects of the films‚Äîthe performers occupy the same house, or appear to have the same parents, or seem to have a brotherly relationship in school or at home‚Äîalso contribute to the impression that incest is occurring. * \\"The natural look\\" - Except for its last films, Nova Studios productions featured performers who were \\"not some Olympus of demi- gods, all gym-buffed, parlor-tanned, and blow-dried. Instead, Nova, offered a down-to-earth collection of real individuals, each with his own sex appeal and identity. The 'typical' Nova model has a lean, natural build which looked even heftier (as did the cock) if the model was short but well proportioned.\\" Expressive eyes and wide, friendly smiles were also very common.Hardesty, \\"Nova Studios, Part One: The Pre-Sound Years,\\" Manshots, July 1997, p. 14.Hardesty, \\"Nova Studios, Part Two: The Final Years,\\" Manshots, August 1997. * Sexual chemistry - Nova Studios performers were often sexually ambivalent individuals who were strongly aroused (rather than turned off) by same-gender sex. Nova Studios sought out thrill-seekers who would be excited by the prospect of sex on film or sex for money, or escorts who wanted to have sex with men their own age for once. * Structured story lines - \\"The majority of Nova's releases had a story to tell, with clear transitions and an element of dramatic conflict. And Walters liked to end his little tales with a comical or O. Henry-esque twist: a signature of his Nova work.\\"Hardesty, \\"Nova Studios, Part One: The Pre-Sound Years,\\" Manshots, July 1997, p. 15. * Structured sexual performances - The nature of Nova Studios' guerrilla filmmaking required that the studio plan to the last detail the shots producers wanted in films. Time was of the essence while shooting, which required rigorous planning. While this occasionally drained the scenes of spontaneity, more often than not they created richly layered sexual performances lacking in the jerky, heavily edited performances rife with jump cuts which characterize most gay adult film in the 2000s. Marketing innovation Nova Studios also pioneered a new marketing technique, the glossy brochure. To help sell films, which were nearly triple the cost of most loops, Nova Studios produced 16-page, full-color, glossy brochures. Each brochure contained nearly 70 small photographs of the film's action. Theft and embezzlement Nova Studios began licensing many of Scott Masters' pre-Nova loops and early Nova Studios material on video in 1980. Unbeknownst to Nova, however, Masters' lover (who had acted as the studio's chief of production and financial manager) had been licensing much of the same material over and over to a wide variety of customers without permission. As this material began to flood the marketplace (much of it in degraded quality), the studio's financial situation deteriorated significantly. Masters attempted to keep Nova Studios afloat by finally producing sound films. Masters had refused to make films with synchronous sound until 1983‚Äîlong after most other gay pornographic studios had not only begun using dialogue synched to the actor's lip movements but also had moved from film to video. Masters' friend, William Higgins, had been recording sound for his films (but not using it) since 1978, and Falcon Studios released their first sound film in 1979. \\"I hated sound at this time. Because of my experience with Greek Lightning, partially, and I said, 'What will sound do for these films except make them ludicrous?' Because the kind of people we use in these films can't talk, can't act, have no background‚Äîthey can't do any of these things, and it's just going to be absurd to make them say things when they aren't going to say them well.\\"Douglas, \\"Behind the Camera: Scott Masters, Part 1,\\" Manshots, November 1997, p. 14. In 1981, Nova Studios bowed to public demand and financial pressures and produced It's the Life. The film was a disaster. Star Giorgio Canali's English was so poor that he mangled his lines. Struggling to recite dialogue in an unfamiliar language, Canali could not maintain an erection. Masters eventually gave up and shot the rest of the scene without sound. Nova Studios would not produce a sound film again until 1983. That film would be Brian's Boys, starring Brian Hawks. But in the intervening two years, Nova Studios lost critical market share. The same year, Nova Studio began dubbing older silent loops. The company added music, limited narration, and asynchronous sexual sounds to the older films and began re-releasing these to make money. Nova Studios also continued to find bright young performers. During 1983, the studio would discover and cast such notable adult film performers as Rick Donovan, Jim Bentley, Tim Kramer and Danny Connors. In 1984, Nova Studios hired Chet Thomas. Thomas was an editor, and he worked on several of Nova's final films. They also released their final two sync-sound productions, Heroes (which featured the debut of Cole Taylor) and Something Wild, with the above stars as well as Scott Avery, Bobby Madison/Brian Michaels, and Randy Page. But that same year, Masters' partner embezzled the company's bank account and fled with the master print of the latest Nova Studio release, Boys Town. The company subsequently discovered that the company's taxes had also not been paid for several years. Faced with a large tax bill and $60,000 in debt, Nova Studios licensed the remainder of the company's products to a third party. Nova Studios ceased to make gay adult films in late 1986. Post-Nova Studios In 1987, Masters was hired by Catalina Video. Catalina Video had been distributing Nova Studios' films to adult bookstores and video stores since about 1982. With Nova Studios in financial distress, Catalina and Nova Studios struck a deal: Catalina would purchase the rights to the unreleased Boys Town. Masters would be free to sell the rights to all other Nova Studios films to another vendor. Catalina would also hire Masters as its head of production, where he would be free to write and direct films on an occasional basis. Masters sold the rights to nearly all of Nova Studios' films to L.A. Video. L.A. Video entered bankruptcy a few years later, leaving the rights to all of Nova Studios' products in legal limbo. Given the transition in his life, Masters stopped using the name \\"Robert Walters\\" and adopted a new stage name, Scott Masters. Once at Catalina, Masters also hired Chet Thomas, his former editor at Nova Studios, to be a full-time director. Thomas subsequently became a notable gay adult film director in his own right.

It is native to the islands of the western Indian Ocean where it occurs on Madagascar, the Aldabra Group and the Glorioso Islands. Description The souimanga sunbird is 10 cm long with a wingspan of 13 cm.Skerrett et al. (2001) The black bill is long, thin and curved. Males of the nominate subspecies have a metallic green head, back and throat. The breast is blackish with a more or less continuous red band while the belly is yellow and the wings and tail are brown. There are yellow tufts at the sides of the breast which become visible when the birds lift their wings in courtship display. Males presumably moult into a duller eclipse plumage by March‚ÄìApril,Benson et al. (1975) losing most of the metallic and red feathering for a few months. Females have grey-brown upperparts, a dull yellow belly and a grey throat and breast with darker markings. Juveniles are similar to the adult females but the chin and throat are sometimes black and the upperparts may be more olive. Abbott's sunbirds (see below) are larger - 11 cm long with a 14 cm wingspan. The males have a broader red breastband and there is no yellow on the underparts which are dark brown (ssp. abbotti) or blackish (ssp. buchenorum). Male birds of the nominate group have wings of c.50‚Äì58 mm, tails of c.31‚Äì41 mm and 20‚Äì25 mm long bills. Females measure 10% less. This bird has a chirruping flight call and a loud, hoarse alarm call. Only the male sings; a fast and scratchy song with frequently repeated phrases. Taxonomy There are five subspecies. The nominate subspecies C. s. sovimanga is found across most of Madagascar and on the Glorioso Islands.Present and rather common on both \\"major\\" islands: Benson et al. (1975). In south-western Madagascar it is replaced by C. s. apolis with C. s. aldabrensis on Aldabra atoll, C. s. abbotti on Assumption Island and C. s. buchenorum on CosmoledoOn most major islands, and overspilling and perhaps stable populations on several minor ones: Rocamora et al. (2003). and Astove. The forms abbotti and buchenorum are sometimes considered to be a separate species, Abbott's sunbird, and would then be called Cinnyris abbotti. This sunbird is one of those separated from the former catch-all genus Nectarinia in Cinnyris. File:Souimanga_Sunbird_(Cinnyris_souimanga).jpgC. s. sovimanga Souimanga sunbird (Cinnyris sovimanga sovimanga) roosting at night Ranomafana.jpgC. s. sovimanga roosting at night, Ranomafana National Park Ecology Together with the Malagasy white-eye and the Madagascan cisticola, souimanga sunbirds are the most common small landbirds across much of their range;For details, see Benson et al. (1975), Rocamora et al. (2003). ample stocks of the present species and the white-eye exist in the maybe 4 square km of habitat in the Glorioso Islands. The IUCN considers it a species of least concern. The souimanga sunbird can be found in a variety of habitats from mountain forests to mangroves and scrubland as well as in parks, gardens and other human- modified ecosystems. They use their curved bill to probe flowers for nectar and also feed on insects and spiders. They have few natural enemies and their nests are inaccessible to most predators. Reproduction The long breeding season lasts from August to March on Aldabra at least. The nest is dome-shaped and has an entrance hole on the side. It is made of plant material such as grass stems, coconut fibre and leaves. It is usually suspended from a branch about 1 to 2 metres above the ground but may be built on a building or in a sinkhole within eroded coral. Two eggs are laid and are incubated for 13 to 14 days; they are whitish with reddish mottling. The young birds fledge after 16 to 18 days. Nest-building and incubation of the eggs are done by the female who also plays a greater role than the male in feeding the chicks.

It is the scientific exploration of the relationships between human biology and culture. \\"Instead of looking for the underlying biological roots of human behavior, biocultural anthropology attempts to understand how culture affects our biological capacities and limitations.\\"  History  Physical anthropologists throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a racial perspective; that is, from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead to cultural differences. After World War II the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology. The shift towards understanding the role of culture to human biology led to the development of Dual inheritance theory in the 1960s. In relation to, and following the development of Dual-inheritance theory, biocultural evolution was introduced and first used in the 1970s.  Key research  * Biocultural approaches to human biology have been utilized since at least 1958 when American Biological Anthropologist Frank B. Livingstone contributed early research explaining the linkages among population growth, subsistence strategy, and the distribution of the sickle cell gene in Liberia. * Human adaptability research in the 1960s focused on two biocultural approaches to fatigue: functional differentiation of skeletal muscles associated with various movements, and human adaptability to modern living involving different work types. * \\"What's Cultural about Biocultural Research,\\" Written by William W. Dressler, connects the cultural perspective of biocultural anthropology to \\"cultural consonance\\" which is defined as \\"a model to assess the approximation of an individuals behavior compared to the guiding awareness of his or her culture. This research has been used to examine outcomes in blood pressure, depressive symptoms, body composition, and dietary habits. * Dr. Romendro Khongsdier's approach to the study of human variation and evolution. * \\"Building a New Biocultural Synthesis\\" by Alan H. Goodman and Thomas L. Leatherman. * \\"New Directions in Biocultural Anthropology\\" edited by Molly Zuckerman and Debra Martin uses various case studies from around the world to understand how biocultural anthropology can be used to understand the relationship between biology and culture in both past and present populations.  Contemporary biocultural anthropology  Biocultural methods focus on the interactions between humans and their environment to understand human biological adaptation and variation. Contemporary biocultural anthropologists view culture as having several key roles in human biological variation: * Culture is a major human adaptation, permitting individuals and populations to adapt to widely varying local ecologies. * Characteristic human biological or biobehavioral features, such as a large frontal cortex and intensive parenting compared to other primates, are viewed in part as an adaptation to the complex social relations created by culture. * Culture shapes the political economy, thereby influencing what resources are available to individuals to feed and shelter themselves, protect themselves from disease, and otherwise maintain their health. * Culture shapes the way people think about the world, altering their biology by influencing their behavior (e.g., food choice) or more directly through psychosomatic effects (e.g., the biological effects of psychological stress). While biocultural anthropologists are found in many academic anthropology departments, usually as a minority of the faculty, certain departments have placed considerable emphasis on the \\"biocultural synthesis\\". Historically, this has included Emory University, the University of Alabama, UMass Amherst (especially in biocultural bioarchaeology) , and the University of Washington , each of which built Ph.D. programs around biocultural anthropology; Binghamton University, which has a M.S. program in biomedical anthropology; Oregon State University, University of Kentucky and others. Paul Baker, an anthropologist at Penn State whose work focused upon human adaptation to environmental variations, is credited with having popularized the concept of \\"biocultural\\" anthropology as a distinct subcategory of anthropology in general. Khongsdier argues that biocultural anthropology is the future of anthropology because it serves as a guiding force towards greater integration of the subdisciplines.  Controversy  Other anthropologists, both biological and cultural, have criticized the biocultural synthesis, generally as part of a broader critique of \\"four-field holism\\" in U.S. anthropology (see anthropology main article). Typically such criticisms rest on the belief that biocultural anthropology imposes holism upon the biological and cultural subfields without adding value, or even destructively. For instance, contributors in the edited volume Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle: Reflections on the Disciplining of Anthropology introduction: reviews: argued that the biocultural synthesis, and anthropological holism more generally, are artifacts from 19th century social evolutionary thought that inappropriately impose scientific positivism upon cultural anthropology. Some departments of anthropology have fully split, usually dividing scientific from humanistic anthropologists, such as Stanford's highly publicized 1998 division into departments of \\"Cultural and Social Anthropology\\" and \\"Anthropological Sciences\\". Underscoring the continuing controversy, this split is now being reversed over the objections of some faculty.Anthropology departments instructed to form combined unit Other departments, such as at Harvard, have distinct biological and sociocultural anthropology \\"wings\\" not designed to foster cross subdisciplinary interchange. Biocultural research has shown to contain a few challenges to the researcher. \\"In general we are much more experienced in measuring the biological than the cultural. It is also difficult to precisely define what is meant by constructs such as socioeconomic status, poverty, rural, and urban. Operationalizing key variables so that they can be measured in ways that are enthnographically valid as well as replicable.

He played college football for the University of Maryland. Early years Growing up in West Natrona, Pennsylvania as one of six children, he was a three-sport athlete at Har-Brack High School (now Highlands High School). He accepted a scholarship from the University of Maryland, where he became a three-year starter. As a sophomore, he contributed to the team having a 9-1 record. In 1951, he was a part of an undefeated team (10-0 record), that outscored its opponents, 381‚Äì74. Maryland also secured its first berth in a major postseason bowl game, the 1952 Sugar Bowl, where it upset the first-ranked University of Tennessee, with him playing a key role after rushing for 153 yards and being named the game's outstanding player. He finished the year with 825 yards and averaging 7.3 yards a carry. Professional career=Pittsburgh Steelers Modzelewski was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the first round (6th overall) of the 1952 NFL Draft. After his rookie season, he served two years in the Air Force. Upon his discharge and return in 1955, he hurt his back in training camp and was traded to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for future hall of famer Marion Motley. Cleveland Browns In 1955, he registered 619 rushing yards (ninth in the league) and 6 touchdowns, playing a key role in the Cleveland Browns repeating as NFL champions. He was a starter for two years until the arrival of future hall of famer Jim Brown in 1957. Modzelewski was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the 1960 NFL Expansion Draft, but he opted to retire instead of reporting to the team. Personal life After football, he chose to set up a high-end restaurant named Mo and Juniors instead. The family owned the place. Oldest brother Joe was a chef and Ed managed it. Dick worked the room during the off season when he lived in Cleveland despite playing for the New York Giants. Ed later became the president of Beef Corral Inc, which had 11 outlets in the Cleveland area. The franchise business was a huge success among the fans and the local community. Modzelewski's parents, Joe and Martha had a big family. Ed's siblings included Joe, Gene, Dick, Betty Lou, and Florence Nowicki. Ed was married to Mary Modzelewski and later, Joanne Modzelewski. Ed Modzelewski's children included Scott Alan Modzelewski; Michael Modzelewski, Bruce Modzelewski and Nancy Giacobbe. Ed had three grandchildren, Lance Modzelewski, Anthony Giacobbe, and Jenny Modzelewski. He died of congestive heart failure in 2015 at the age of 86 at his home in West Sedona, Arizona. His brother Dick Modzelewski also played in the National Football League.

He had considerable influence on the content and standing of graphology worldwide. He also published numerous articles in many languages in periodicals as diverse as The Listener, Zeitschrift f√ºr Menschenkenntnis and the Journal of Social Psychology. He also founded the professional graphology society in the Netherlands. He also started two academic periodicals: one in Dutch and the other in English. Many graphologists worldwide today use Saudek‚Äôs work without knowing the origin. He published Experimental Graphology in 1929. Saudek examined the speed in handwriting. He quantified handwriting by use of a microscope, caliper, pressure board, ruler, protractor and slow-motion pictures. Saudek also attempted to deal with graphological phenomena in terms acceptable to the experimental psychologists. Life Robert Saudek was born in Kol√≠n, Austria- Hungary, now Czech Republic, on 21 April 1880 (some sources say 1881), the son of a manufacturer of feather beds; Robert had a brother and two sisters. He was a polyglot: by the end of his life he had mastered Czech, German, Dutch, French and English. He studied a correspondence course produced by the well known German graphologist Hans Busse (who incidentally translated Crepieux- Jamin‚Äôs work into German) and was very familiar with the work of Ludwig Klages. Around 1900 he studied at the Universities of Prague, Leipzig and the Sorbonne. From 1903 to 1909 he authored plays, essays, epigrams and novels. It is reported that he ran an intelligence bureau in The Hague during World War I, from 1914 to 1918. In 1918 Saudek entered the diplomatic service for the Czechoslovakian Government, in the Netherlands and in England. The family settled in The Hague that year. They moved away from the Hague in 1922, living in Berlin until 1924. In 1924 Saudek moved to London, where he was correspondent to the Prager Presse newspaper and established a profitable graphological practice. Works In 1918 he authored a novel with a graphological plot, Diplomats, which was published in German, Czech, Dutch, French and Italian (1921). In the 1920s he began the Bulletin of the Dutch Association for Scientific Graphology (Nederlands Tijdschrift Voor Graphologie. Orgaan Van De Vereeniging Voor Wetenschappelijke Grafologie). In 1963 this became Acta Graphologica. In 1925 Unwin published Psychology of Handwriting; it also appeared in Dutch, German, Danish, and Swedish. Saudek supplemented his income by drawing rents from two large properties in Berlin. He also gave lectures, notably one to the British Psychological Society, Medical section on 21 October 1926, which became an article (see Saudek 1927). He also made radio broadcasts with the BBC; one such broadcast took place on 7 September 1927. His next book was Experimental Graphology, which appeared in German, Czech and Dutch in 1926. Saudek lectured on experimental graphology at Berlin, Amsterdam, Brussels and Prague from 1926 to 1928. The book Experiments in Handwriting was published in London in 1928. Possibly related to the book and his lecture tour initiatives, Saudek was awarded a PhD in Brussels, Belgium in the same year. This now meant that he was able to use the title Dr Saudek. Another book followed in 1932, What Your Handwriting Shows‚Äîa shorter, more popular-style book than the others. Then in 1933 Anonymous Letters was published; this concentrated on the criminological aspects of handwriting analysis work. Death The Times of 16 April 1935 carried his obituary: \\"Robert Saudek at the age of 55 years died on 15 April 1935. Born in Bohemia and having lived for some years in London, where he had numerous friends in scientific and journalistic circles.\\" This obituary, though, was slightly inaccurate as Saudek died six days before his 55th birthday. His death certificate shows that he died at 20 Devonshire Place in London, which was probably a private hospital in 1935. The cause of death was shown as: (a) Septicaemia; (b) Haemorhage (c) Chronic duodenal Ulcer. His papers are in the Senate House Library, University of London.

It is the seventh volume of The Edge Chronicles and the third of the Rook Saga trilogy; within the stories' own chronology it is the ninth novel, following the Quint Saga and Twig Saga trilogies. Plot summary Freeglader starts in the capital of the Edge, Undertown. The city is slowly being destroyed by a dark maelstrom, triggered by Vox Verlix. The Undertowners begin a mass exodus, fleeing to a new life in a vast, beautiful area of justice and equality, the Free Glades. The exodus is led by Rook Barkwater, the hero of the story, and the others in a breakaway group of academics known as the librarian knights. On the journey to the Free Glades Rook gets caught up in a storm near the Twilight Woods, causing him to lose his memory. Upon reaching the Deepwoods the exodus is attacked by the recently hatched battle flocks of Shrykes. Only through the timely arrival of the Freeglade Lancers are the Librarians and Undertowners saved (combined with Xanth killing the Roost mother). Meanwhile, Amberfuce has reached the Foundry Glade. There he presents his partner with plans for Glade Eaters, special weapons designed by Vox Verlix. The two along with the Goblin Nations begin plans for an attack on the Free Glades. Rook, meanwhile having regained his memory, joins the Free Lancers. Xanth, his name cleared, joins the Librarian Knights. Everything is peaceful for several months until the attack comes. The massive Glade Eaters, backed by the armies of the Goblin Nations, destroy most of the Free Glades before being destroyed. The Sky Pirates, the Librarian Knights, the Freeglade Lancers and the Ghosts of Screetown fight determinedly but are outnumbered. Even the arrival of the banderbears fails to turn the tide. However, at the last minute large numbers of peaceful goblins revolt, killing the Goblin Chieftains. The war ends, and everyone sets about rebuilding the Free Glades.

After discharge, they continue seeing each other. Jennifer Melfi is at a dinner party with colleagues, including Elliot Kupferberg. The conversation turns to the recent study claiming sociopaths take advantage of talk therapy. Kupferberg angers and shocks her by revealing that Tony Soprano is her patient. However, she reads the study at home and is convinced of its findings. At his next session, Tony is relaxed; her responses become sarcastic and aggressive. When she says she intends to cease treating him, he is taken aback and hurt: \\"We're making progress! It's been seven years!\\" She says, \\"You don't give a shit about commitments, about what I do.\\" She waits for him to go, then closes the door on him. Janice tells Tony that, as far as they can tell, Junior's money has run out, and she asks him to contribute, together with her and Bobby, so that he does not have to go into a state institution. Tony scornfully refuses. Silvio garrotes Soprano soldier Burt Gervasi, who has been negotiating with the New York family. Phil speaks contemptuously to Albie and Butchie about \\"this pygmy thing over in Jersey\\". \\"We decapitate, and do business with whatever's left,\\" he says. \\"Make it happen.\\" Butchie and Albie meet with their own subordinates and order the murders of Tony, Silvio, and Bobby, to be done swiftly in one 24-hour period. The police learn that something is going on, and Agent Harris warns Tony that his life may be in danger. Tony decides to act first and kill Phil, using the \\"cousins\\", the Italian hitmen who performed the hit on Rusty Millio. The order is eventually passed down to Corky Caporale, who makes contact with them. But they kill the wrong man, the father of Phil's comare ‚Äî and kill his comare, too. Tony realizes the urgent danger, and orders Silvio to tell everyone in the family to go to their safe house. But it is too late. Almost simultaneously, Bobby is killed in a model railway store in Long Island; and, leaving the Bada Bing together, Silvio and Patsy are intercepted by two Lupertazzi hit men, Ray-Ray and Petey B. Silvio is shot several times and severely wounded; the doctors say he may never regain consciousness. Patsy escapes unhurt. Tony goes home and breaks the news to Carmela. He is going to a safe house; she must go to some other safe place. He goes upstairs to A.J.'s bedroom, where he now spends most of his time. He is in bed. Tony tries to explain things gently. When A.J. starts whimpering, he pulls him out of bed and throws him onto the floor. At night, Tony, Paulie, Carlo, Walden Belfiore and Dante Greco drive to an old suburban safe house. Tony goes upstairs to get some sleep, clutching the AR-10 assault rifle that Bobby gave him for his birthday. Deceased * Burt Gervasi: garotted to death by Silvio Dante for betraying his crime family and working with the Lupertazzis. * Alec Kastropovic (Ukrainian mistress's father): shot dead in the head by Italo, the Italian hitman, who mistook him for Phil Leotardo, who he was supposed to murder on orders from Tony Soprano to eliminate the Lupertazzi threat to his crime family. * Yaryna Kastropovic (Phil Leotardo's Ukrainian mistress): shot in the abdomen and then shot dead in the head by Italo, murdered for being present at the failed Leotardo hit. *Bobby Baccalieri: shot dead by two Lupertazzi hitmen on orders from Phil Leotardo, as part of Phil's move to quickly wipe out the DiMeo family's management after continued long arguments and fights between the two families. Final appearances \\"The Blue Comet\\" marks the final appearances in The Sopranos of these main or longtime recurring characters: * Jennifer Melfi: Tony Soprano's on-and-off psychotherapist ever since 1999. Originally contacted to help treat his panic attacks, Tony has also used his talk therapy sessions to deal with stresses in his life and gain advice on how to act in his personal and criminal life. Also, Melfi was, at times, Tony's romantic interest, though his advances were rebuffed. * Arthur \\"Artie\\" Bucco: a restaurateur, owner of Nuovo Vesuvio, a common mobster hangout, and Tony's close friend from childhood. After the fall-out with Davey Scatino in 2000, essentially, Tony's only civilian friend left. * Charmaine Bucco: the wife of Artie Bucco and a childhood friend of Carmela and Tony Soprano. Throughout the series, she would urge Artie not to deal with the mobsters in his career and life, but eventually started to seemingly tolerate their gatherings in their restaurant. * Elliot Kupferberg: Melfi's own psychotherapist and mentor who would often urge her to drop Tony Soprano as a patient. Also, an enthusiast of the Mafia. Title reference * The Blue Comet was a passenger train operated by the Central Railroad of New Jersey which ran between Atlantic City and Jersey City from 1929 to 1941. The train's locomotive and passenger cars, as well as its interior were stylized in blue color. Bobby is buying a Blue Comet train model when he is murdered. Production=Writing The episode's general plot outline was developed collectively by the writing staff of The Sopranos, which for the second part of the sixth season consisted of showrunner and head writer David Chase, executive producer and co-showrunner Terence Winter, executive producer Matthew Weiner and supervising producers and writing team Diane Frolov and Andrew Schneider. After the main story had been outlined, the script for \\"The Blue Comet\\" was written by Chase and Weiner. It is Chase's 29th writing credit for the series (including story credits) and Weiner's 12th and final. The penultimate episode marks the fifth time Chase and Weiner have collaborated on a The Sopranos script, following \\"The Test Dream\\" of season five and \\"Kaisha\\" (also with Winter), \\"Soprano Home Movies\\" (also with Frolov and Schneider) and \\"Kennedy and Heidi\\" of season six. The research study that Elliot Kupferberg introduces to Jennifer Melfi, which she later carefully reads and which makes her decide to finally drop Tony Soprano as her patient, is an actual three-volume study called The Criminal Personality, written by Dr. Samuel Yochelson and Dr. Stanton Samenow, published between 1977 and 1986. David Chase discovered the study when he and some Sopranos writers attended a psychiatric conference. Chase further asked forensic psychologist Nancy Duggan to analyze Tony Soprano's mental state and the progress of his psychotherapy with Melfi; Duggan also opined that talk therapy was enabling Melfi's patient to commit crime and justify his actions for himself. The Criminal Personality greatly impressed Chase after he read it and he decided that its introduction in the show would spell the end of Tony and Melfi's psychotherapy story arc in the series. After the airing of the episode, psychotherapists reported an outpouring of questions and concern from their clientele about the ethics of dropping patients unilaterally. Chase also commented about the seeming lack of finality in Tony Soprano's therapy, stating that its depiction was most realistic as psychotherapy most often is marked with moments of progress but is essentially an endless process until one party decides he or she has had enough of it. The cardboard cutout of the character Silvio Dante that appears near the end of the episode in the safehouse was added by the writers as a way to give the character some sort of presence in the scene. The writers created the safehouse as an unoccupied house the family keep for emergencies and where various items, such as the promotional cutout of Silvio for the Bada Bing!, are stored. Casting Peter Bucossi, the stunt coordinator for the show for all of its six seasons, ever since the pilot episode, plays the role of Petey B. in this episode (a character also named after him), one of the Lupertazzi crime family hoodlums. Petey is the driver of \\"Ray Ray\\" D'Abaldo's car that attacks Silvio and Patsy when they attempt to flee the Bada Bing!. Filming Interior scenes set at the Soprano residence, back room of the strip club Bada Bing!, Italian restaurant Nuovo Vesuvio and Melfi's psychiatrist's office were filmed at Silvercup Studios. \\"The Blue Comet\\" was directed by Alan Taylor and photographed by Phil Abraham. Both had worked intermittently on the show in the same capacities since the first season. The penultimate episode marks Taylor's ninth credit as director and Abraham's 47th credit as director of photography; it is the final credit of the series for both. Before filming commenced, David Chase and Taylor held a pre-production director's meeting‚Äîcalled a \\"tone meeting\\" by the crew‚Äîin which Chase explained how he envisioned the filming of the episode's scenes in great detail and provided directions for Taylor to follow during principal photography. \\"The Blue Comet\\" was filmed in January and February 2007, primarily at the show's usual filming locations: exterior and some interior scenes were filmed on location in New Jersey and New York while the majority of the interior scenes were shot at Silvercup Studios, New York City. The Soprano residence, meat market Satriale's, strip club Bada Bing! and Italian restaurant Nuovo Vesuvio‚Äîfour of the most frequently recurring and recognizable backdrops of the series‚Äîare all featured prominently in the episode. Some scenes were set in environments not typically featured in the series. The gunfire scene that takes place in a model railroading store was filmed on location at a store called Trainland in Lynbrook, New York. Scenes set at the Averna Social Club, a meeting place for the Lupertazzi family in the context of the series, were filmed at a bar on Manhattan's Mulberry Street, New York City. Janice and Bobby's residence, formerly owned by Johnny Sack, appears briefly in the episode; the scene was shot on location in North Caldwell, New Jersey. Post-production The editing of \\"The Blue Comet\\" was done by William B. Stich in close consultation with Chase. During post- production, Chase selected the music for the episode, using previously recorded and released songs he saw fit for particular scenes and rearranged the filmed scenes into their final order. Some filmed scenes were cut during editing. One such involved the character Burt Gervasi telling Silvio Dante that he has begun cooperating with the Lupertazzi family, a scene that was meant as a setup for the murder that ended up as the episode's opening. References to prior episodes * When Phil Leotardo starts listing his grievances about the DiMeo family, they include the beating of \\"Coco\\" in \\"The Second Coming,\\" \\"Fat Dom\\" Gamiello's disappearance (murder) in \\"Cold Stones\\" and his brother Billy's murder (\\"Long Term Parking\\"). * Tony quit psychotherapy by his own will two times before: In \\"I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano,\\" he did so after he told Melfi to go into hiding as he was at war with Junior and, in \\"Calling All Cars,\\" he quit it after citing a lack of progress in curbing his impulses. Also, in \\"Walk Like a Man,\\" he seriously considered quitting it yet again. However, Melfi herself never dropped him, as happened in this episode, although she did for a time refuse to accept him back in the beginning of Season 2, angry at Tony because she believed her forced move out of town allowed a patient of hers to commit suicide. * In the pilot episode, when Tony first comes to therapy, Jennifer Melfi opens the door to her office and shows him in. In this episode, after dropping him, she opens the doors and shows him out. * Tony tells Carmela he \\"quit therapy\\" at an Italian Restaurant (Nuovo Vesuvio) over red wine. She says it was actually a good idea. In the pilot episode, Tony also first tells Carmela he is starting therapy in an Italian restaurant over glasses of red wine and Carmela thinks it is a wonderful idea. * A flashback scene from \\"Soprano Home Movies\\" is used at the end of the episode before Tony goes to sleep‚ÄîBobby and Tony are on a boat on a lake, where Bobby comments \\"you probably don't even hear it when it happens, right?\\" Additionally, Tony brings the assault rifle, which Bobby gave him as a birthday present in the same episode, to the hideout safehouse. * Bobby's interest in model trains was first shown in the Season 6 premiere episode, \\"Members Only.\\" Other cultural and historical references * In the mental-health ward, A.J. and other patients watch Metalocalypse. * Also in the mental-health ward, A.J. can be heard playing the video game Halo 2. * When Cavalleria rusticana starts playing on the radio during their meeting at Nuovo Vesuvio, Tony and Silvio begin mimicking boxing in slow motion. The intermezzo from Cavalleria rusticana was used as the main theme of Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull, a biographical film about the boxer Jake LaMotta. * Tony's comment to Jennifer Melfi, \\"You don't need a gynecologist to know the way the wind blows\\" references lyrics from Bob Dylan's Subterranean Homesick Blues: \\"You don't need a weatherman to know the way the wind blows.\\" * Paulie's line, \\"I lived through the '70s by the skin of my nuts when the Colombos were going at it\\", alludes to a mob war in the 1970s that involved the Colombo crime family and in particular to the battles between Mafia factions led by Joseph Colombo and Crazy Joe Gallo. Tony Sirico, who plays Paulie, was also an alleged associate of the crime family during this time. * Tony calls Bobby an \\"Exile on Main Street\\" after Janice informs him he still cares about Junior. Music * The Doors' \\"When the Music's Over\\" is playing in Bada Bing! when Bobby summons Paulie to the backroom to discuss the hit on Phil. * When Patsy and Silvio are packing up to leave the Bada Bing, \\"Antisaint\\" by Chevelle can be heard muffled in the background. * During the shootout at the Bada Bing's parking lot, Nat King Cole's \\"Ramblin' Rose\\" is playing on Patsy's car radio. * The song played in the final scene and over the end credits is an extended instrumental version of Tindersticks' song \\"Running Wild.\\" Another one of Tindersticks' songs, \\"Tiny Tears,\\" was previously prominently featured in the Season 1 episode \\"Isabella\\" during scenes of Tony's lethargic state prior to his assassination attempt. Reception=Ratings According to Nielsen ratings, \\"The Blue Comet\\" attracted an average of eight million American viewers when first broadcast in the United States on HBO on Sunday June 3, 2007. This was the show's second best ratings for the second part of the sixth season. Only the following week's series finale, which drew 11.9 million viewers, received higher numbers. Critical response \\"The Blue Comet\\" received very positive critical reviews following its original broadcast and has since then frequently been named by critics as one of the best episodes of the series. Much praise was directed at the episode's pacing and efficient build-up of suspense as well as the execution of the gunfire scenes toward the end of the episode. The episode was also praised for story elements concerning the escalation of the conflict between the rivaling Mafia families of the show and for the conclusion it brought to the professional and personal relationship between the characters Tony Soprano and Jennifer Melfi. Tom Biro of television webblog TV Squad was impressed with the episode because of \\"the way we're beginning to close the door on the lives of some people and get an idea on who will be around at the end and who won't\\" and because \\"we're treated to something thrilling not only in story, but visually as well.\\" Biro awarded \\"The Blue Comet\\" the site's highest score of 7. Geoffrey Dunn of Metro Silicon Valley stated that \\"Chase orchestrated the tension to a full crescendo.\\" Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote \\"In this penultimate episode (which David Chase co-wrote), you can see the veil of surprise, of artistic feints, red herrings, theory-bating and any other cool narrative device totally vanish. It's as if things snuck up on us. Time is not just running out, it's almost all gone. Action needed to step forth and be counted. And so, true to form historically, the second to last episode had more than it's fair share of Big Moments.\\" Goodman also called Bobby's death scene \\"priceless\\" and \\"Really well done.\\" Heather Havrilesky of Salon wrote \\"No sad music, no slow motion, no teary funeral, no time for condolences. When the blood-dimmed tide finally rolled in during last night's penultimate Sopranos episode, an eerie quiet settled in.\\" Matt Roush of TV Guide gave the episode a favorable review, writing \\"TV's landmark family crime drama went on a bloody rampage this week, just as we expected might happen in the next-to- last episode. [...] It was a sensational way to get us primed for Sunday's series finale.\\" Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune wrote that \\"[The] second- to-last episode was certainly a classic\\" and praised it for its suspenseful storytelling. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly offered \\"The Blue Comet\\" a favorable estimation, writing \\"Every moment in this bloody, bullet- riddled penultimate episode is about regular, familiar old ways that have now gone terribly, irreversibly awry. [...] In the last hours of this epic drama, every detail glitters with bitter meaning\\". Matt Zoller Seitz of Slant Magazine described the episode as \\"the most atypically typical whack-fest the show has served up in quite some time\\" and \\"an orgy of Mafia mayhem\\". Zoller Seitz also praised the final therapy scene between Tony Soprano and Jennifer Melfi for its depth. Alan Sepinwall of The Star Ledger called the penultimate episode \\"one of the best‚Äîand certainly one of the busiest‚Äîepisodes in the history of The Sopranos,\\" further describing it as \\"a superb, scary, thrilling episode.\\" He also characterized Bobby's death scene as \\"a little masterpiece of editing\\". Brian Tallerico of UGO called the episode \\"mind-blowing\\" and \\"intense\\", wrote that \\"[he] really didn't expect David Chase to take his show out with this much gunfire\\" and gave it an \\"A\\", the site's second-highest score.

It is Grade II listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Originally part of the defences of the castle, it was converted into a garden in the late 18th century, and purchased by the city council in 1912. Boundaries The gardens are bounded on the north-west by the city wall with Northernhay Gardens beyond, and on the north-east by the castle wall with Athelstan's Tower at the junction of the two walls. The eastern boundary is at Castle Street with the early Norman gatehouse of the castle at the top and Rougemont House below. On the south the boundary is formed by Exeter City Central Library and on the south-east by the Phoenix Arts Centre and the Royal Albert Memorial Museum. History The site was originally part of William the Conqueror's defences for Rougemont Castle during the Norman Conquest of England. When William ordered the construction of Rougemont Castle in 1068 a defensive ringwork was included which characterises the shape of gardens today. It has been noted that the ditch in the gardens seems to be much larger than the apparent need for defence; this could be because it may have been the site of the Roman quarry which provided the stone from which the original city walls were built. The approximate area of Rougemont Gardens is shown as the regions marked \\"D\\" to the east of the road that leads to the castle in this plan by John Norden, dated 1617. In around 1768, John Patch, a local surgeon, built Rougemont House just below the Norman gatehouse. He also set out gardens behind the house. Successive occupiers of the house made alterations to the house and gardens and by Victorian times the garden was being referred to as \\"a perfect sylvan retreat\\". Exeter City Council purchased Rougemont House in 1911 and the grounds of the house in the following year. For many years during the 20th century, Rougemont House‚Äîa Grade II* listed building‚Äîwas open to the public as a museum, though it has since closed. (pdf file) The whole of the gardens, including the castle and city walls, Athelstan's Tower and the gatehouse are scheduled as a nationally important archaeological site, and are maintained as a public open space by the city council.

After completing primary and secondary education in Fatih Military Junior High School, he entered to Military School of Medicine in 1899. He went on a training course at G√ºlhane as of graduating with the rank of doctor captain on 4 November 1905. He was assigned as a doctor at Maltepe Military Hospital and Feshane Factory between the years 1907-1910 and improved his expertise in military camps and hospitals by being sent to Germany in 1910. He was a medic in the Ottoman Army during the dissolution of the empire. He created a medicine to cure typhus, which was used largely by the Central Powers. Saydam was one of the key people of the Independence War. He landed at Samsun with Mustafa Kemal (later named: Atat√ºrk) in 1919 to start the resistance in Anatolia. He was known as a reformist while he was the Prime Minister. Just four years after his death, the single party period came to an end in Turkey. Political life Refik Saydam in the 1920s Saydam became the vice-president of the Department of Health of the Ministry of War on 1 December 1913 and was promoted to the rank of major on 1 June 1915. Meanwhile, he established the Institute of Bacteriology and his vaccines against epidemics and especially typhus had been effective. After the truce, he assigned to the order of 9th Army Inspectorship and passed to Anatolia along with Mustafa Kemal as the health inspector of the army, soon named as the 3rd Army Inspectorship, on 15 May 1919. He attended to Erzurum and Sivas Congresses, came to Ankara with the delegation committee and joined to the opening ceremony of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey with the elections held for the first term as the deputy of Bayazƒ±t on 23 April 1920. He was elected as the Minister of Health in the Council of Ministers under the presidency of Fevzi Pasha, as the Minister of Health and Social Relief upon the resignation of Adnan, and resigned from ministry suggesting his sickness on 14 December 1921. Being elected as ƒ∞stanbul deputy, he officiated as the Minister of Health under the cabinet of ƒ∞smet Pasha in 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th sessions. After the death of Atat√ºrk, at the Second Bayar Government formed on 11 November 1938, Saydam performed as the Minister of Interior and was assigned as the general secretary of the Republican People's Party. He was appointed to Prime Ministry of the 11th and 12th government of Turkey by President ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º as ƒ∞stanbul Deputy at the 6th session elections on 25 January 1939. During this duty, he died in ƒ∞stanbul on 8 July 1942 and was buried in Ankara. Endeavoring to extend the health services and establishing health facilities, especially the Hƒ±fzƒ±ssƒ±ha Foundation which is today known with his name, at the period of his health ministry, he also tried to protect the nation from the negative impacts of World War II during the period of prime ministry.

Biography  Page from Babies, Grosset & Dunlap, 1963. Gyo Fujikawa was born in Berkeley, California, to Japanese parents, Hikoz≈ç and Y≈´ko Fujikawa (Ëó§Â∑ùÂπΩÂ≠ê). The masculine name Gyo (pronounced \\"gyoh\\") is after a Chinese emperor her father admired. Gyo Fujikawa moved to Los Angeles to attend Chouinard Art Institute in 1926, having received a scholarship, and befriended Japanese dancer Michio Ito and many fellow Nisei writers and artists. After graduating and spending a year in Japan, she was on the Chouinard faculty from 1933-37.\\"Gyo Fujikawa.\\" St. James Guide to Children's Writers, 5th ed. (St. James Press, 1999). She worked for the Walt Disney Company in California as a promotional artist, before moving to New York in 1941. Fujikawa avoided the forced internment of West Coast Japanese and Japanese Americans during World War II as she was living in New York at the time. Her family, however, spent the war in the internment camp at Rohwer, Arkansas. From 1943-51 she worked for pharmaceutical advertising agency William Douglas McAdams. In 1951 Fujikawa became a full-time freelancer, producing a dozen front-cover illustrations for Children's Digest and other periodicals, and about five years later was approached by juvenile editor Debra Dorfman at Grosset & Dunlap to illustrate Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"A Child's Garden of Verses\\". This was her first published children's book, in 1957. Babies, the first book both written and illustrated by Fujikawa in 1963, was also one of the earliest children's books to use multi-racial characters, a consistent feature across her body of work. After the success of \\"A Child's Garden of Verses,\\" Fujikawa became one of the first artists to contract for Royalty payment, refusing to perform work unless her publisher agreed to pay her royalties. Fujikawa's books have been reprinted for mass-market and published worldwide. Her most popular books, Babies, Baby Animals, A to Z Picture Book and Oh!, What A Busy Day!, unfailingly represent a happy, detailed version of childhood. Her joyous illustrations remain sweet and nostalgic, without ever becoming overly saccharine. Her paintings of children are recognizable for round happy faces, rosy cheeks and simple dot eyes. Discussing her respect for her audience, she said: > \\"In illustrating for children, what I relish most is trying to satisfy the > constant question in the back of my mind--will this picture capture a > child's imagination? What can I do to enhance it further? Does it help to > tell a story? I am far from being successful (whatever that means), but I am > ever so grateful to small readers who find 'something' in any book of mine.\\" Fujikawa died on November 26, 1998, in New York Hospital. Although she had been engaged at the age of 19, she never married.  Other work  Fujikawa's notable commercial clients included Upjohn Company vitamins, Beech-Nut baby food and Eskimo Pie, creating the round-faced child icon for the ice cream treat. She created six stamps for the United States Post Office, including the 1997 32¬¢ \\"yellow rose\\" self-adhesive stamp and the United States-Japan Treaty ratification centenary stamp of 1960.

This form of companion planting can save the main crop from decimation by pests without the use of pesticides. While many trap crops have successfully diverted pests off of focal crops in small scale greenhouse, garden and field experiments, only a small portion of these plants have been shown to reduce pest damage at larger commercial scales. A common explanation for reported trap cropping failures, is that attractive trap plants only protect nearby plants if the insects do not move back into the main crop. In a review of 100 trap cropping examples in 2006, only 10 trap crops were classified as successful at a commercial scale, and in all successful cases, trap cropping was supplemented with management practices that specifically limited insect dispersal from the trap crop back into the main crop. Usage Trap crops, when used on an industrial scale, are generally planted at a key time in the pest's life-cycle, and then destroyed before that life-cycle finishes and the pest might have transferred from the trap plants to the main crop. Examples of trap crops include: * Alfalfa planted in strips among cotton, to draw away lygus bugs, while castor beans surround the field, or tobacco planted in strips among it, to protect from the budworm Heliothis. * Rose enthusiasts often plant Pelargonium geraniums among their rosebushes because Japanese beetles are drawn to the geraniums, which are toxic to them. * Chervil is used by gardeners to protect vegetable plants from slugs. * Rye, sesbania, and sicklepod are used to protect soybeans from corn seeding maggots, stink bugs, and velvet green caterpillars, respectively. * Mustard and alfalfa planted near strawberries to attract lygus bugs, [7] a method pioneered by Jim Cochran. * Blue Hubbard squash is planted near cucurbit crops to attract squash vine borer, squash bugs, and both spotted and striped Cucumber beetle. Trap crops can be planted around the circumference of the field to be protected, which is assumed to act as a barrier for entry by pests, or they can be interspersed among the focul crop, for example being planted every ninth row. Planting crops in rows helps facilitate supplemental management practices that prevent insect pest dispersal back into the main field, such as driving a vehicle above the trap crop which then removes insect pests by vacuuming them off of the trap crop row or targeted insecticides, which are only deployed on the trap crop. Even if pesticides are used to control insects on the trap crop, total pesticides are greatly reduced in this scenario over conventional agricultural pesticide applications because they are only deployed on a small portion of the farm (the trap crop). Other strategies that prevent dispersal of insect pests back into the main crop include cutting the trap plants, applying predators to the trap plant that eat the pest, and planting a high ratio of trap plants to other plants. Operation Recent studies on host-plant finding have shown that flying pests are far less successful if their host-plants are surrounded by any other plant, or even \\"decoy-plants\\" made of green plastic, cardboard or any other green material. The host-plant finding process occurs in three phases. The first phase is stimulation by odours characteristic to the host-plant. This induces the insect to try to land on the plant it seeks. But insects avoid landing on brown (bare) soil. So if only the host-plant is present, the insects will quasi-systematically find it by landing on the only green thing around. This is called an \\"appropriate landing\\". When it does an \\"inappropriate landing\\", it flies off to any other nearby patch of green. It eventually leaves the area if there are too many \\"inappropriate\\" landings. The second phase of host-plant finding is for the insect to make short flights from leaf to leaf to assess the plant's overall suitability. The number of leaf-to-leaf flights varies according to the insect species and to the host- plant stimulus received from each leaf. But the insect must accumulate sufficient stimuli from the host-plant to lay eggs; so it must make a certain number of consecutive \\"appropriate\\" landings. Hence if it makes an \\"inappropriate landing\\", the assessment of that plant is negative and the insect must start the process anew.Finch, S. and Collier, R. (2000), Host‚Äêplant selection by insects ‚Äì a theory based on ‚Äòappropriate/inappropriate landings‚Äô by pest insects of cruciferous plants. Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata, 96: 91-102. doi:10.1046/j.1570-7458.2000.00684.x Thus it was shown that clover used as a ground cover had the same disruptive effect on eight pest species from four insect orders. An experiment showed that 36% of cabbage root flies laid eggs beside cabbages growing in bare soil (which resulted in no crop), compared with only 7% beside cabbages growing in clover (which allowed a good crop). Also that simple decoys made of green card disrupted appropriate landings just as well as did the live ground cover.

His five-decade-long association with the team has led to him being regarded as one of the most iconic figures within Cork football. Born in Cork, Morgan was introduced to Gaelic games by his father, a native of Galway who had played hurling at junior level with the county. He came to prominence with Col√°iste Chr√≠ost R√≠ before later winning back-to-back Sigerson Cup medals with University College Cork. A two-time All- Ireland medallist with the Nemo Rangers senior team, Morgan also won four Leinster medals and seven championship medals. Morgan made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of eighteen when he first linked up with the Cork minor team. He enjoyed an unsuccessful tenure in this grade, and was later an All-Ireland runner-up with the under-21 team. Morgan made his senior debut during the 1966 championship. He went on to play a key role for Cork as a goalkeeper during a successful era, and won one All-Ireland medal, five Munster medals and one National Football League medal. An All-Ireland runner- up on one occasion, Morgan captained the team to All-Ireland victory in 1973. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team, Morgan won four Railway Cup medals. Throughout his inter-county career he made 40 championship appearances. Morgan retired from inter-county football following the conclusion of the 1981 championship. Morgan has enjoyed success at all grades as a coach and selector with Nemo Rangers and University College Cork, however, it was as manager of the Cork senior team that he enjoyed his greatest triumphs. As manager on three separate occasions he guided Cork through a period of unprecedented provincial and national dominance, winning fourteen major honours. These include two All-Ireland Championships, the first time Cork claimed back-to-back titles, eight Munster Championships, two National Leagues, including one league-championship double, and two McGrath Cups. Biography Billy Morgan was born in Douglas on the south side of Cork city in 1945. He was born into a household that, ironically, had a strong hurling tradition. Both his parents were from Galway and, from an early age, Morgan's dream was to play hurling for Cork. Over time, however, he became interested in Gaelic football. Morgan was educated at the Col√°iste Chr√≠ost R√≠ school and later attended University College Cork. Here Morgan made a name for himself as a goalkeeper and became a key member of the university's football team. In 1966 he won a Sigerson Cup winners' medal as UCC defeated University College Galway (UCG) in the inter-varsities tournament. A second consecutive defeat of UCG in 1967 gave Morgan a second Sigerson Cup title. Morgan later worked as a secondary school teacher, before travelling to New York University in the early 1980s to complete a master's degree in physical education. He also ran a pub in the centre of Cork city for a period and he currently works as a financial adviserBilly Morgan Financial services Cork with his son Brian Morgan and with his nephew William Morgan. Both of these younger Morgan's have followed in Billy's football footsteps and have had successes with Nemo Rangers. Morgan's second son, Alan Morgan, also plays football with the club and regularly comes off the bench. Playing career=Club Morgan played his club football with Nemo Rangers club. He lined out in his first senior county championship final in 1970, however, Muskerry defeated Nemo in their first final appearance. Two years later in 1972 Morgan was captain of the team when he captured that elusive county winners' medal when Nemo Rangers defeated UCC. Nemo's march to success continued later in the year as the club captured the Munster club title before Morgan lined out in the All-Ireland final. St. Vincent's of Dublin provided the opposition, however, a late Jimmy Keaveney point forced a draw and a replay. First-half goals in the replay by Jimmy Barrett and Billy Cogan were followed by two more Liam Goode and S√©amus Coughlan goals in the second-half. The final score of 4‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì10 gave Morgan a first All-Ireland club winners' medal and the honour of collecting the cup on behalf of his club. Two years later in 1974 Morgan added a second county championship winners' medal to his collection. A second Munster club title followed, before Nemo booked their place in another All-Ireland final. UCD provided the opposition on that occasion, however, Morgan's side were defeated by 1‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì12.The GAA Book of Lists p. 417 1975 saw Morgan capture a third county title. A third Munster club winners' medal soon followed, however, Nemo were beaten in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final. After surrendering their county title in 1976, Nemo were back the following year with Morgan picking up a fourth county winners' medal. A fifth county championship of the decade followed in 1978 before Morgan collected a fourth Munster club title. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Nemo against Scotstown of Monaghan. Snow hampered the game, however, Cogan proved the hero as Nemo won the game by 2‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì3.The GAA Book of Lists pp. 418‚Äì419 It was his second All-Ireland club winners' medal and his last major victory with Nemo. Morgan remained as a non- playing substitute with Nemo Rangers, as the club secured further county and provincial titles throughout the 1980s. Inter-county By the early 1960s Morgan was a key part of Cork's inter-county set-up and was playing on the county's minor team as an outfield player. He lined out at centre-forward on the Cork team that was beaten by Kerry in the 1963 Munster minor final. Morgan later joined the county's under-21 team, where he was installed in his favoured position of goalkeeper. He won a Munster title in this grade in 1965, however, Cork were later shocked by Kildare in the All-Ireland final. A 2‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì7 win for the 'Lilywhites' resulted in Morgan ending up on the losing side. Following the county under-21 campaign in 1965 Morgan was invited to join the Cork senior football panel. He was the sub-goalie for the 1965‚Äì1966 National Football League and made his senior debut in the Munster Championship in 1966. He won his first senior Munster title that year as Cork defeated a Kerry team attempting to capture a record-breaking ninth consecutive provincial title. Cork were subsequently defeated in the All-Ireland semi- final by eventual champions Galway. In 1967 Morgan secured a second Munster winners' medal as Kerry were defeated by a single point in the provincial decider. Cork went one step further this year and reached the All-Ireland final. Meath were the opponents on that occasion. Cork led by 0‚Äì3 to 0‚Äì1 after a terrible first half of football; however, Meath's Terry Kearns scored a key goal after the interval. At the final whistle Meath were the champions by 1‚Äì9 to 0‚Äì9.The GAA Book of Lists p. 401 After losing their provincial title over the course of the next few years Cork were back in 1971. A 0‚Äì25 to 0‚Äì14 trouncing of back-to-back All-Ireland champions Kerry gave Morgan a third Munster winners' medal. Cork, however, were later defeated by eventual champions Offaly in the All-Ireland semi-final. Two years later Morgan became the first Nemo Rangers man to captain the Cork senior football team. That year he secured his fourth and final Munster winners' medal. The 5‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì15 defeat of arch-rivals Kerry showed the traditional football powers that Cork were coming. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Cork against Galway. Teenager Jimmy Barry-Murphy scored the first of his two goals after just two minutes before scored a third for Cork after switching to left wing-forward. At full-time Cork were the champions by 3‚Äì17 to 2‚Äì13. This victory gave Morgan an All-Ireland winners' medal while he also became the first Cork man since 1945 yo lift the Sam Maguire Cup. He was later presented with the Texaco Footballer of the Year award. Morgan remains the only goalkeeper to be presented with that award. In 1974 Cork proved that their success was not a flash in the pan. A 1‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì7 defeat gave the county a second consecutive Munster title. It was Morgan's fifth provincial winners' medal in all. A certain amount of over-confidence crept into the side as Cork were subsequently defeated by eventual champions Dublin in the All-Ireland semi- final. The next seven years saw Morgan's side lose every Munster final to a Kerry team widely regarded as the greatest of all-time. There was some consolation towards the end of his career as Cork won a National League title in 1980.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 177 Morgan retired from inter-county football in 1981. Inter-provincial Morgan also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial football competition and enjoyed much success over the course of a decade. He first lined out with his province in 1967, however, Munster were defeated by Connacht on that occasion. It was the first of four consecutive years of defeats for Morgan and for Munster. After losing his place on the team to Kerry's Johnny Culloty in 1971, Morgan was back the following year. That year he won his first Railway Cup winners' medal as Leinster were accounted for after a replay. After defeat in 1973 and the loss of his place on the team in 1974, Morgan returned to win a second Railway Cup title in 1975. He was a non-playing substitute as Munster when Munster made it two-in-a-row in 1976. Morgan was back as the first-choice goalkeeper for two more Railway Cup wins on 1977 ad 1978. Managerial career=Cork: 1986‚Äì1996 Morgan first got a taste of inter-county managerial experience in his last championship season when he was player-manager with Cork. His period in charge ended with defeat in the Munster final of 1981. Five year later in the autumn of 1986 Morgan was appointed Cork manager for a second time. The task ahead was enormous as Cork's nearest neighbours, Kerry, had won eleven of the last twelve Munster titles and had put Cork to the sword on most of those occasions. In his first year in charge Morgan worked the oracle. The traditional Munster final between Cork and Kerry ended in a draw, however, Cork triumphed over the four-in-a-row hopefuls by 0‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì5. Cork subsequently qualified for the All-Ireland final with Meath providing the opposition. Midway through the first-half Cork had a goal chance blocked by Mick Lyons when Jimmy Kerrigan looked to be through for a seven-point lead. Instead, it was Meath who led by 1‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì8 at half-time, courtesy of a Colm O'Rourke goal. Cork's Larry Tompkins's radar was also off course as he missed six out of eight free-kicks. At the full-time whistle Meath were the winners by 1‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì11.The GAA Book of Lists p. 407 In 1988 Morgan's team retained their Munster title before a second All-Ireland final appearance beckoned. Meath provided the opposition once again as Cork got off to a good start with a Teddy McCarthy goal. By the end of the game Cork led by a point, however, Brian Stafford scored the equaliser. The replay was a controversial affair. Meath's Gerry McEntee was sent-off after just seven minutes. In spite of being reduced to fourteen men, Meath hung on for a narrow 0‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì12 victory. It was Morgan's second consecutive defeat as manager. A third consecutive Munster title was secured in 1989 and, once again, Cork qualified for a third consecutive All-Ireland final. Mayo were the opponents on this occasion and the game was a close affair for much of the opening half. An Anthony Finnerty goal after thirty-eight minutes gave Mayo a brief lead, however, the Connacht champs failed to score for the last nineteen minutes. Teddy McCarthy took control and Cork secured victory by 0‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì11.The GAA Book of Lists pp. 407‚Äì408 It was Morgan's first All-Ireland title as manager and Cork's first since 1973, when Morgan was captain. In 1990, while still under Morgan's guidance, Cork made it a remarkable four Munster titles on the trot. A fourth consecutive All-Ireland final appearance quickly followed, with old rivals Meath providing the opposition. Cork suffered a blow in the first-half when Colm O'Neill was sent off; however, Shay Fahy was playing a blinder at midfield. In spite of only having fourteen men Cork won the game by 0‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì9.The GAA Book of Lists p. 408 It was a second consecutive All-Ireland title for Morgan, the first time that Cork had achieved the feat. This victory was all the more special as the Cork hurling team had already won their respective All-Ireland title a fortnight earlier. It was the first time in the modern era that a county had won the hurling and football 'double'. In 1991 Cork lost their provincial crown to Kerry and Morgan faced a year of difficulties with the Cork County Board. For a period it looked as if he might resign, however, he stayed on only to face defeat again in 1992. Once again the knives were out for him, however, Cork won back to Munster title in 1993. Cork subsequently qualified for the All-Ireland final, with Derry providing the opposition. Things did not go to plan as 'the Rebels' were reduced to fourteen men when Tony Davis was harshly red-carded. S√©amus Downey scored the winning goal as Derry secured their first All-Ireland with a 1‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì8 victory.The GAA Book of Lists pp. 408‚Äì409 In 1994 Morgan managed Cork to a second consecutive Munster winners' medal following another convincing victory over Tipperary. Cork, however, were later defeated by eventual champions Down in the All- Ireland semi-final. In 1995 Morgan's Cork won a third consecutive Munster title, a record-breaking seventh in nine seasons, as Kerry fell in the provincial decider. Once again Cork were subsequently defeated by eventual All-Ireland champions Dublin in the All-Ireland semi-final. In 1996 the old order in Munster was restored. Kerry defeated Cork by 0‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì11 in the Munster final, taking their first provincial title since 1991 in the process. This defeat saw Cork exit the championship and effectively brought Morgan's ten-season tenure as manager to an end. Nemo Rangers: 2000‚Äì2003 Morgan has been involved in coaching various Nemo Rangers teams at all levels; however, in the late 1990s he took charge of the club‚Äôs senior football team. In 2000 Nemo Rangers broke back after a six-year absence and won the county senior championship following a ten-point defeat of divisional side Carbery. Nemo later represented Cork in the provincial club championship and even reached the final of that competition. A 0‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì7 defeat of Glenflesk gave the club another Munster club winners' medal. Morgan subsequently guided his team to a foot-and-mouth delayed All-Ireland club final, with Mayo's Crossmolina providing the opposition. Nemo looked to be in the driving seat, however, a second-half comeback, inspired by Kieran McDonald, saw the momentum switch to the Mayo side. A late Colin Corkery goal narrowed the deficit to one point, however, Morgan's side were eventually and narrowly defeated by 0‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì12.The GAA Book of Lists p. 425 In 2001 Morgan coached Nemo to a second county championship title as the club trounced Bantry Blues in the final. A second Munster club winners' medal was quickly captured, after a 1‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì10 defeat of Fethard. Morgan's side subsequently lined out in his second All- Ireland club final, this time with Ballinderry providing the opposition. The championship decider was switched to Semple Stadium because of the reconstruction of Croke Park, however, a change of venue did not suit Nemo. Goals by Gerard Cassidy and Declan Bateson gave the Derry side a comfortable 2‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì9 victory. It was a second consecutive All-Ireland defeat for Nemo. 2002 saw Nemo becoming the first team in nearly sixty years to win three county championship titles in-a-row. A third consecutive Munster club title quickly followed for Morgan's team, as Nemo trounced Monaleen of Limerick by 4‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì6. For the third successive year Rangers subsequently lined out in the All-Ireland club final, however, the club faced the unpalatable prospect of becoming three-in-a-row losers. Crossmolina provided the opposition for the second time in three years and the game was a close affair. It was played in Croke Park on St.Patrick's day. Colin Corkery scored six points to give Nemo a merited 0‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì9 victory. At the third time of asking Morgan had finally guided his club to an All-Ireland club winners' medal. Cork: 2003‚Äì2007 In late 2003 Morgan was coaxed back to managing the Cork senior football team, however, his third time in charge saw Cork enjoy some mixed results. Beginning with his first season back, Cork were disappointing in the championship. After exiting the Munster championship at the hands of Kerry, Cork were unceremoniously dumped out of the championship by Fermanagh in the third-round of the All-Ireland qualifiers. In 2005 Morgan guided his young, new Cork team to a first Munster final appearance under his tenure. Reigning All-Ireland champions Kerry provided the opposition, however, Cork were still off the mark. The 1‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì10 defeat was not the end of the road as Cork still had another chance to claim the All-Ireland title. Because of the structure of the championship Cork and Kerry met for a second time in the All-Ireland semi- final. That game turned into a rout as Kerry trounced their greatest rivals by 1‚Äì19 to 0‚Äì9. In 2006 Morgan's side lined out against Kerry in the Munster final once again. That game ended in a 0‚Äì10 apiece draw. The replay saw a much fresher Cork team defeat Kerry by 1‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì9. James Masters proved the hero of the day, as he scored 1‚Äì7. Morgan had finally secured a Munster winners' medal with his new team. The quirks of the championship saw Cork face Kerry again in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final for the second year in-a-row. In a similar pattern to the two previous encounters Cork failed to beat Kerry at Croke Park. A 0‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì10 resulted in Morgan's side being dumped out of the championship. In 2007 Morgan's Cork narrowly lost their Munster crown to Kerry. In spite of the 1‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì13 defeat Cork still had another chance to claim the All-Ireland title. Cork later did well in the All-Ireland series and finally qualified for the championship decider. It was the seventh time that Morgan was aiding a Cork team in an All-Ireland final, either as a player or as a manager. Kerry, however, were the opponents. While the first half was played on an even keel, 'the Kingdom' ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued. At the full-time whistle Cork were trounced by 3‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì9. Morgan subsequently stepped down as Cork football manager.

He served as the first Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey during 1920‚Äì1921.Biography on biyografi.net  Biography = Early career  Bekir Sami Kunduh, unknown date Bekir Sami was born in Saniba, Ossetia. He was a son of Musa Kunduh Pasha (Musa Kundukhov; (1818‚Äì1889)), a Tagaur Ossetian chieftain and major-general in the Russian Imperial Army, who then defected to the Ottoman Empire. He earned his Baccalaureate from Galatasaray High School and went to Paris to study political science. He worked at the Turkish embassy at St. Petersburg and then was appointed as Mutasarrƒ±f of Amasya. Later in his career he served successively as governor of Van, Trabzon, Bursa, Beirut and Aleppo. His last appointment before the 30 October 1918 Armistice of Mudros that ended the war between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies was as governor of Beirut.  Post- World War I  Prominent nationalists at the Sivas Congress. Left to right: Muzaffer Kƒ±lƒ±√ß, Rauf (Orbay), Bekir Sami (Kunduh), Mustafa Kemal (Atat√ºrk), Ru≈üen E≈üref (√únaydƒ±n), Cemil Cahit (Toydemir), Cevat Abbas (G√ºrer) Shortly after the armistice, Bekir Sami became a leading member of the Karakol society, alongside other former influential members of the Committee of Union and Progress. Karakol was a secret Turkish nationalist organization formed in October or November 1918 to continue various aspects of the CUP's covert work, such as resistance to the Allied occupation, resistance to partition of Anatolia, and concealment of former CUP members accused of participation in the Armenian genocide. Summoned to Anatolia by Mustafa Kemal, Bekir Sami attended the Erzurum and Sivas congresses (JulySeptember 1919), after which he joined the ranks of Turkish revolutionaries negotiating a united position with the Ottoman imperial government. Bekir Sami's name therefore appears as one of the signatories to the 22 October 1919 Amasya Protocol. One provision of the protocol was to hold fresh parliamentary elections, and in these Bekir Sami was elected to represent Amasya in the final Ottoman Chamber of Deputies which was seated in Istanbul on 12 January 1920. In the event, the new chamber only lasted barely two months. Allied forces occupied Istanbul on 16 March and the chamber went into recess. Three days later, Mustafa Kemal announced the establishment of the Ankara-based Grand National Assembly of Turkey. Bekir Sami was one of 70 nationalist deputies who moved to Ankara and took a seat as a deputy at the new assembly's first meeting on 23 April 1920. When Mustafa Kemal formed his first cabinet on 3 May 1920, Bekir Sami was named as the minister of foreign affairs. (After the 1923 founding of the Republic of Turkey, this cabinet was retrospectively designated as the republic's first, and Bekir Sami thereby became its first foreign minister). Representing Turkey, he led the nationalist government's delegation to the Soviet Union. Between 21 February and 12 March 1921 he led the Turkish delegation to the Conference of London. By this point in the post-war negotiations, a major sticking point was the trial and punishment of Turkish prisoners held by the British on the island of Malta. Previous post-war Ottoman governments, aiming to stave off aggressive territorial ambitions by the victorious allies, had felt a need to acquiesce to the Allies' pressure for an international court or foreign power to try Turks accused of wartime crimes. Nationalist opinion in Turkey rejected this trade-off and Bekir Sami communicated to the Allies that Turkey would not accept foreign trials for the prisoners in Malta. As reported by the British Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon, Bekir Sami: > contrasted the situation of the German war crimes suspects with that of the > Turkish suspects. ... He tried to reassure me that they are ready to punish > those [responsible for the] crimes ... then he said this task must be left > to his government. Despite Bekir Sami's advocacy, the version of the London Agreement drafted by the British required Turkey to release all British prisoners, while Britain retained the right to detain and try anyone involved in massacres of Armenians or who had attacked British soldiers. The nationalist assembly viewed the London Agreement as a violation of Turkish sovereignty and Bekir Sami as having acted beyond the authority that the government had given him. After his return to Ankara, he resigned his office as foreign minister on 8 May 1921. On 17 September 1924 he was one of the founders of the Progressive Republican Party of Turkey, at the request of Mustafa Kemal. The party only lasted nine months until it was ordered dissolved on 5 June 1925 following the Sheikh Said rebellion. When there was an attempt on Mustafa Kemal's life in Izmir in 1926, Bekir Sami was among many who were arrested. He was acquitted at trial. Bekir Sami died in Istanbul on 16 January 1933. Although he did not have a surname during his lifetime, the Surname Law was adopted the year after his death, and his family adopted the surname Kunduh.

He served as Minister of Foreign Affairs between 1960‚Äì1962. Early years Selim Sarper was born on June 14, 1899 in Constantinople. He spent his youth years in Germany, where he finished the high school in 1918, and attended University of Berlin to study Law. At the age of 24, The Turkish Republic was proclaimed in his home country. Returned home, he studied at Ankara University, Law School. He then served as a teacher of French language in a high school at Adana in 1923 before he worked as a clerk at the Independence Tribunal in the early years of the Republican era. In 1927, he entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a translator. Diplomatic career Selim Sarper (second from right at the desk) during a meeting of United Nations Security Council in New York City ca. 1951 In 1928, he was appointed as vice-consul in Odessa, Soviet Union, in 1929 third secretary at the Turkish Embassy in Moscow and two years later he was promoted to the post of second secretary at the same office. His further assignments were, Consul in Komotini, Greece in 1933, Consul in Odessa in 1935, Consul in Berlin, Germany in 1937 and Ambassador in Bucharest, Romania in 1939. In the 1940s, Sarper served as the Director of the governmental Press and Information Agency. During the World War II years, he was responsible for the administration of the official propaganda and information. In 1944, Selim Sarper was appointed Turkey's Ambassador to Moscow, an important mission during the last years of World War II and the early years of the Cold War (1947-1991). According to President ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º's judgement relating to a conversation between Sarper and Stalin's Minister of Foreign Affairs Molotov on June 7, 1945, Turkey, even remained neutral in the war, might have been under a territorial claim threat from the Soviet Union. Due to this context, Turkey subsequently positioned itself alongside the United States. After the related official documents in the U.S. archives were made available to the public, it became clear that Sarper reported the subject of his conversation to the U.S. Ambassador W. Averell Harriman, even before he notified his government. However, his report to Harriman does not mention any threat by the Soviet Union, and the memoirs of Molotov deny such an allegation. In 1946, Sarper became Ambassador to Italy in Rome, in 1947 United Nations Permanent Representative and in 1957 Permanent Representative of Turkey to NATO. Politics On May 28, the next day of the 1960 Turkish coup d'√©tat, Selim Sarper, took United States Ambassador in Ankara Fletcher Warren to the coup leader General Cemal G√ºrsel for a visit. Sarper was appointed the same day Minister of Foreign Affairs replacing Fahri Korut√ºrk in the draft cabinet list. Sarper entered later the Republican People's Party (CHP) running for a seat in the parliament at the 1961 general elections. He continued to serve at his post as Minister of Foreign Affairs until February 16, 1962. Revealed U.S. diplomatic documents show that during his term in the ƒ∞n√∂n√º's coalition cabinet, Sarper made assessments to the U.S. Government and told high words about his own head of state like \\"That G√ºrsel was not a great brain\\". In the 1965 general elections, Sarper was re-elected into the parliament as a deputy from Istanbul Province. Illness and death On May 14, 1968, Selim Sarper underwent a lung surgery the second time.

Development=Origins The origins of the KT-1 can be found within the KTX programme, which had been launched during 1988 on behalf of the Republic of Korea Air Force (RKAF). The programme, which sought to develop an indigenously designed trainer aircraft, was a joint effort between aircraft manufacturer Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI) and government body Agency for Defence Development (ADD); the latter was responsible for overseeing the project, while the former performed the detailed design work as well as the majority of manufacturing activity.Doyle, Andrew. \\"State body to lead South Korean helicopter effort.\\" Flight International, 13 August 2002. Unusually, CATIA computer aided design (CAD) software was used to produce the design, being the first use of such techniques for an aircraft in its class. A series of nine prototypes were constructed, the first being complete during June 1991. During November 1991, the maiden flight of the KT-1 took place, after which the flight testing programme formally commenced. During 1995, the aircraft was officially named 'Woongbi'. In 1998, it was announced that the final test flight had been performed. During the following year, an initial production contract was signed for eighty-five aircraft, with provisions for an additional twenty, between manufacturer Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) and the RKAF. Further development During 2002, KAI revealed that they were working on the production of an upgraded and armed version of the KT-1 basic trainer. This variant, designated KO-1, was intended to be used in the forward air control and counter-insurgency (COIN) roles. Development was conducted in cooperation with the Agency for Defence Development (ADD) and had been undertaken in response to an existing RKAF requirement for 20-40 aircraft.\\"KAI arms trainer for new role.\\" Flight International, 5 March 2002.

They recorded meetings of Parliament and Acts of Parliament. Until 1483 the rolls recorded parliamentary proceedings (petitions, bills and answers, both public and private) which formed the basis of Acts of Parliament, but seldom the statutes themselves. From 1483 to 1534 both public and private acts were enrolled in the rolls; after 1535 only those private acts for which an enrolment fee was paid appear, and from 1593 only the titles of private acts are mentioned in the rolls. By 1629 all proceedings other than the acts themselves disappeared from the rolls and from 1759 the titles of private acts disappeared too. Enrolment of Public Acts on manuscript parchment rolls continued until 1850. The longest Act of Parliament in the form of a scroll is an act regarding taxation passed in 1821. It is nearly a quarter of a mile (348 metres) long, and used to take two men a whole day to rewind. Until 1850, a paper draft was brought into the House in which the Bill started; after the committee stage there the Bill was inscribed on a parchment roll and this parchment was then passed to the other House which could introduce amendments. The original Bill was never re-written and knives were used to scrape away the script from the top surface of the rolls, before new text was added. Since 1850 two copies of each Act have been printed on vellum, one for preservation in the House of Lords (now the Parliamentary Archives), and the other for transmission to the Public Record Office (now The National Archives). The rolls for 1272‚Äì1503 were first published in the eighteenth century, as Rotuli Parliamentorum; ut et Petitiones, et Placita in Parliamento (London, 1767‚Äì77), under the general editorship of John Strachey. A modern CD-ROM edition has been supported by the Leverhulme Trust, as The Parliament Rolls of Medieval England. References to Rolls of Parliament are often abbreviated to Rot. Parl.

Some of the city's most important streets and avenues meet at Pla√ßa Catalunya: Passeig de Gr√†cia, Rambla de Catalunya, La Rambla, and Portal de l'√Ängel, in addition to Ronda de Sant Pere, Carrer de Vergara, and Carrer de Pelai. The plaza occupies an area of about 50,000 square metres. It is especially known for its fountains and statues, its proximity to some of Barcelona's most popular attractions, and the flocks of pigeons that gather in the centre. Pla√ßa de Catalunya History After the medieval city walls were demolished in the 19th century, ambitious designs for the city's public spaces were conceived under the guidance of notable urban planners. Pla√ßa Catalunya was conceived as part of pla Rovira in 1859, but no official permission from the government was given until the 1888 Universal Exposition. It was urbanised for the first time in 1902 and was further modified in 1929, on the occasion of the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition, which also included the construction of a metro station. Architect Francisco Nebot designed the changes made in 1929. In May 2011 Pla√ßa Catalunya was the main location where anti-government protests and sit ins were held in Barcelona, mirroring the events in other Spanish cities.

Military career=First World War and Interwar In 1918, as an officer in the 1st Regiment of Guides, Victor van Strydonck commanded the last cavalry charge in western Europe, the successful Charge of Burkel. For his role in the charge, van Strydonck was made a baron and given the title \\"de Burkel\\" in 1937 after the location of the battle. A cavalry officer, van Strydonck de Burkel commanded the Cavalry School (1920‚Äì1923) and the 1st Cavalry Division (1928‚Äì1933), served as the inspector-general of the Belgian Gendarmerie (1933‚Äì1939), and was the commander of the Cavalry Corps (1933‚Äì1939) prior to World War II. In 1938, Van Strydonck announced his retirement from the army but was re-activated in late 1939 when war between Britain, France and Germany broke out although Belgium remained neutral. Second World War During the invasion of Belgium by Germany in May 1940, van Strydonck de Burkel commanded the 1st Military Zone. At his own initiative, Van Strydonck created a camp in Tenby, Wales where he established a Camp militaire belge de Regroupment (CMBR) for Belgian soldiers who had escaped to Britain after the surrender. Initially, morale among the several hundred soldiers was extremely low among the troops in Tenby and drunkenness and insubordination presented a major problem. Van Strydonck lobbied the British to improve the conditions and, to keep the soldiers busy, organized a major parade on Belgian National Day (21 July) 1941. He succeeded in affiliating the Belgian contingent with the local Home Guard which improved morale. With the arrival of the Belgian government in exile and the formal creation of the Free Belgian Forces, he became the Commander in Chief and presided over the gradual organization of the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade, a unit that later fought in the campaign in northwestern Europe. In 1941 he became the Inspector-General of the Belgian ground forces in Great Britain. After the Allies re-entered northwestern Europe in 1944, van Strydonck de Burkel became the Chief of the Belgian Military Mission to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF).

His father was a railroad conductor, and Ocala represented the midpoint of his train route. Perry was happy to discover that he could swim in the clean, clear water at Silver Springs, and he would walk the six miles from Ocala to the springs. In order to earn pocket change, he started teaching local residents to swim for twenty-five cents per lesson. In 1924, Perry became Ocala High School's swim coach and star swimmer; he was only 16 years old at the time. He once swam 25 miles in seven hours, 28 minutes. Perry attended the University of Florida in nearby Gainesville, and was a member of the Florida Gators swimming and diving team in 1933 and 1934.

Career Newton Perry riding a bicycle underwater with Edith Allen Landt at Silver Springs. Perry learned all he could about swimming, diving and life-guarding. When the American Red Cross published their aquatics safety manual during the 1920s, they selected Silver Springs to shoot the underwater photographs for their manuals. Perry served as the model in many of the Red Cross manual photographs. Silver Springs in the 1920s and 1930s was not that well known and the attraction owners, Carl G. Ray, Sr. and W. M. \\"Shorty\\" Davidson, would invite journalists from all over the country to come visit their attraction. Perry and his sisters would put on swimming exhibitions both the water's surface and under it. Some of those snapshots would appear in newspapers in Atlanta, Washington, D.C., New York, Jacksonville, Tampa, and other large cities. Life magazine published several articles on Silver Springs and the Perry family. Ray and Davidson invited American sportswriter and short movie producer, Grantland Rice, to vacation in the Ocala area and to be their guest on a tour of Silver Springs. While Rice was visiting the springs, he witnessed the aquatic abilities of Perry and was interested in what he saw. Rice set up his motion picture cameras to record the interesting footage of the swimmer both on the surface and under the surface of the water. Perry demonstrated his powerful freestyle up stream and then dove underwater to perform swimming backwards, somersaults, eating a banana, drinking a soda and other unusual underwater skills. He had stayed underwater for three minutes and 45 seconds. Over the next thirty years, Perry helped produce over 150 of Grantland Rice's \\"Sportlight\\" series short films. These films were human interest stories about fifteen minutes in length, which were shown before the featured movies at theaters across the country. The subjects included different themes like picnics, weddings, school rooms, track meets, night clubs with bands, and bartenders among other story lines. Rice once did a reel called \\"The Human Fish\\" featuring Perry, and proclaimed him as the \\"best swimmer in America.\\"Ray Washington, \\" Ocala's Newt Perry: The Human Fish,\\" Ocala Star-Banner, p. 10C (April 11, 1982). Retrieved July 12, 2012. Perry became a go-to consultant for Hollywood movies that involved on-location water scenes, and Florida's crystal-clear spring waters provided nearly ideal underwater filming locations. He played a significant role in the production of MGM's Tarzan Finds a Son! (1939) at Silver Springs and Tarzan's Secret Treasure (1941) at Wakulla Springs through his relationship with actor-swimmer Johnny Weissmuller who played Tarzan. He also influenced Universal Studio's decision to film the Creature from the Black Lagoon and its sequels at Wakulla Springs and Silver Springs, as well as the hiring of Florida swimmer Ricou Browning to play the Creature in the movie's underwater sequences. He worked with several noted actors including Weissmuller, W.C. Fields, Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, Jayne Mansfield, Ann Blyth, Lloyd Bridges. In 1948, Perry spearheaded the development of the Weeki Wachee Springs attraction, and is credited with performing the first underwater shows there. His daughter Margaret Eileen Perry performed as one of the youngest mermaids ever at the springs in 1948 at age 13. It was later that year that Perry met his future wife Dot. Perry was president of the Florida Attraction Association and attending a convention at Miami Beach. Dot was training for the 1948 U.S. Olympic diving team in one- meter and tower diving. A mutual friend and former Olympic diver, Kathryn Rawls, introduced the two. An instant connection began when Perry climbed to the top of a 10-meter diving platform and started diving, dive for dive, with Dot. Dot found that Perry could do almost anything in the water and that led to a year-long, long-distance romance. Dot had signed with the \\"Water Follies,\\" a local synchronized swimming act, after failing to qualify for the Olympic diving team. She toured Cuba, Mexico, Central and South America as their star diver. Later life After Perry and Dot's wedding in the fall of 1950, they moved to San Marcos, Texas to develop Aquerena Springs, an underwater attraction similar to Weeki Wachee. After completing the development of Aquarena, Perry and his wife returned to Ocala. They founded an instructional swimming school in Ocala that remains in operation today. Perry's most successful swimming student was his nephew, Don Schollander, a five-time Olympic gold medalist at the 1964 and 1968 Summer Olympics.Susan Smiley-Height, \\" The Perry legacy lives on,\\" Ocala Star-Banner (July 5, 2006).

Kveldulf is described as an ulfh√©√∞inn, a shape-shifter (hamrammr), or a berserker.Egils saga, ch. 1. Family Kveldulf was the son of Bjalfi and Hallbera Ulfsd√≥ttir, daughter of Ulf the Brave and sister of Hallbjorn Halftroll. He was thus first cousin to Ketil Trout of Halogaland and a kinsman of the latter's descendant, Ketil Trout of Namdalen.Landnamabok 5:3. Kveldulf married Salbjorg Karadottir, the daughter of the Viking chieftain Berle-Kari; he was thus the brother-in-law of the Viking Eyvind Lambi and the skald Olvir Hnufa. Kveldulf and Salbjorg had two sons, Thorolf and Grim (who was better known as Skalla-Gr√≠mr or \\"Bald Grim\\"). Opposition to King Harald Kveldulf opposed the rising power of Harald Fairhair, king of Vestfold, but refused to join the coalition against Harald led by King Kjotve the Rich of Agder, and would not fight in the army of the kings of Sogn.

The student and the instructor sit in tandem. Production ceased in 1991 after 7 years but restarted briefly in 1998. Design and development Prior to the eighties Chile possessed a decrepit fleet of military trainers obtained under the Mutual Defense Assistance Act. However, these trainers had become exceedingly difficult to repair following passage of a US arms embargo in 1976.John R. Bawden,\\"Cutting Off the Dictator: the United States Arms Embargo of the Pinochet Regime, 1974‚Äì1988\\", Journal of Latin American Studies, 45:3 (August 2013): 513‚Äì43. The PA-28R-300 Pill√°n was developed by Piper Aircraft in the United States as a two-seat military trainer for assembly in Chile, based on a PA-32R fuselage with a new center-section and wing stressed for aerobatics. The first prototype designated XBT first flew at Lakeland on 6 March 1981 and was followed by a second prototype, designated YBT. The second prototype first flew on 31 August 1981 and was then delivered to Chile. The prototype XBT was delivered to Chile in January 1982 but was written off on 10 March 1982. Production of kits at Vero Beach Municipal Airport commenced with three pre- production kits which were delivered for assembly in Chile in 1982, Vero Beach then produced 120 kits for assembly in Chile for the Chilean and Spanish Air Force. The first production aircraft was delivered by ENAER to the Chilean Air Force Air Academy in August 1985. The Spanish aircraft were assembled in Spain by CASA. Apart from a few turbine powered aircraft, all Pill√°ns were powered by a 300 hp (224 kW) Textron Lycoming AEIO-540-K1K5 six cylinder horizontally opposed piston engine. In 1985 a turboprop variant was developed by ENAER as the T-35A Aucan. In early 1986 one of the piston-engined pre-production aircraft was sent to Soloy Aviation Solutions in the United States for modification to install a 420 shp Allison 250B-17D engine.

As a composer mainly of songs and as administrator of Dutch musical life, his influence during his lifetime was considerable. Life As a boy, Verhulst sang in a Catholic choir; here he distinguished himself by his gift for music. In his teens, he succeeded in becoming a first violinist in the court chapel of King William I. In 1836, Felix Mendelssohn, who was on holiday in Scheveningen, was shown an overture written by Verhulst, and took him as a pupil; he began studying with Mendelssohn in 1838.Grove, George; Fuller- Maitland, John Alexander; Pratt, Waldo Selden; Boyd, Charles Newell (1910). . The Macmillan Company. page 261. In Leipzig, Verhulst was appointed as conductor of the Euterpe orchestra, for which he wrote his Symphony in E minor. King William II urged him to return to The Hague in 1842, where he dedicated himself to the writing of Dutch songs for some time. Six years later, he became the chief conductor of the Rotterdam Music Society (Maatschappij tot Bevordering der Toonkunst). For the celebration of its fifty-year anniversary in 1854, he succeeded in engaging many prominent musicians, such as Franz Liszt. The following years would bring a number of other appointments: 1860 as conductor of concerts at the scientific society Diligentia Society in The Hague, and 1864 at both the orchestral society Caecilia and the Felix Meritis Society in Amsterdam. By accepting these positions, Verhulst had acquired a great amount of power and influence on Dutch music life. However, his conservative taste led to an increasing amount of criticism, particularly his refusal to endorse or execute performances of the music of Berlioz, Franz Liszt, and most of all Wagner. If orchestra directors wished to see works by these composers performed, they had to handle the organisation themselves and engage a guest conductor - and risk the wrath of Verhulst, which could be considerable. This led to a public backlash, and in 1883 Diligentia imposed Richard Hol as a substitute conductor for performances of Wagner. In 1886, Verhulst was appointed an honorary member of Diligentia on the occasion of his seventieth birthday, but the membership was revoked after less than three months.http://www.classical- composers.org/comp/verhulst Hereupon he withdrew from his other positions and from public life.Baker, Theodore; Slonimsky, Nicolas (1900). .

Work Verhulst wrote dozens of songs in the tradition of Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann, usually on texts provided by the Dutch author J. P. Heije. The textual quality of these songs is doubtful, but no-one can question the appropriateness of Verhulst's music. Key features of his works are a typical use of chromaticism and long preludes and epilogues. His best songs approach the level of his idol, Robert Schumann. He also wrote sacred music (e.g. the (at least) 3 Masses, Opus 20, 50 and 55Opus 20 recorded on a Chandos Records CD; Opus 50 vocal score at IMSLP; opus 55 material at a library in Brussels according to RISM), chamber works including three string quartetsat least the third has been broadcast. The first two were published by Hofmeister of Leipzig as his opus 6 around 1839, according to Hofmeisters Monatsberichte, HMB 1839 p. 147 and HMB 1840 p. 19 - early 1840 receipt, so probably published 1839. The third, his opus 21 in E-flat, was published by 1845 (HMB 1845, p.82.) IMSLP has material for quartets 1 and 3. and orchestral music (several overtures, among which the Gijsbrecht van Aemstel overture, and a Symphony in E minor, Opus 46). Most of his compositions stem from the time before his activities as a conductor and organiser. Robert Schumann's Overture, Scherzo and Finale is dedicated to Verhulst.
