The album was originally issued with the title Pharaoh and was later re-released with the titles Pharoah, Pharaoh Sanders Quintet, Pharoah Sanders Quintet, and Pharaoh's First, and was also included in its entirety in the 2012 4-CD compilation In The Beginning 1963-1964. and later that year Sanders reconnected with John Coltrane, whom he had met previously while Coltrane was in California with Miles Davis's group. He also formed his own group which included John Hicks, Wilbur Ware, and Billy Higgins. and also joined Sun Ra's group, substituting for John Gilmore, who had taken a leave of absence to play with Art Blakey. (Recordings of Sanders with Sun Ra were released in 1976 on Sun Ra Featuring Pharoah Sanders & Black Harold as well as on In The Beginning 1963-1964. In September of that year, Sanders entered a studio as a band leader for the first time, and recorded two extended tracks at the loft of audio engineer Jerry Newman using a group featuring bebop-oriented musicians, including trumpeter Stan Foster, pianist Jane Getz, bassist William Bennett, and drummer Marvin Pattillo. The tracks were released by ESP-Disk in 1965 as the third item in their catalog (number 1003) under the title Pharaoh. Bernard Stollman, founder of ESP-Disk, recalled having met Sanders at the recording session: \\"He was extremely shy. Unless you knew him well, he was not garrulous... Pharoah didn't greet me; he just approached the engineer regarding the placement of the microphones. When it was over, I paid the group.\\" Reception Reviews of the recording have been mixed, with a number of writers expressing puzzlement over the juxtaposition of Sanders, who \\"wastes no time blowing his horn apart,\\", playing \\"some trademark wail and spasmodic multiphonic roar,\\" with the competent but relatively conservative side musicians selected for the session. Al Campbell, writing for AllMusic, stated that Sanders' sidemen \\"play bebop, Sanders doesn't. You can hear that Sanders is ready to go out, but restrains himself due to this mismatching of musicians... It sounds as if this date was set up for someone like Dexter Gordon, who didn't show up, so they got Sanders at the last minute. Sanders really has no purpose on this conventional date besides initial name exposure as a leader. What a shame.\\" AllAboutJazz reviewer Trevor MacLaren wrote: \\"This record has always been a thorn in the discography of saxophonist Pharoah Sanders. The playing is solid, but his legendary ripping chops are extremely subdued, making this disc seem out of place. Not to mention the fact that the musicians that Sanders is playing with are bebop players, slapping out bop riffs. At no other time did Sanders ever seek out that sound. Nowhere during his Coltrane apprenticeship did he even hint at bop.\\" JazzTimes reviewer Scott Verrastro stated: \\"This album truly protrudes in the tenor's early catalogue... The overall demeanor of the two sidelong cuts... is purely hard bop, energetic but largely nondescript... There's an undeniably palpable sensation that this session was a result of an open date on the studio calendar and Sanders just happened to be the most recognizable name, thusly earning the 'leader' title. Overall, it's not a particularly memorable debut but nevertheless an intriguing document.\\" Other writers were more positive. AllAboutJazz reviewer Clifford Allen wrote that the disc \\"though somewhat of an aesthetic anomaly in the ESP catalog and, at the time, given more 'could- have-been' status than it probably deserved, is a crucial workshop puzzle- piece that gives historians of improvised music one very important look at Pharoah Sanders and his young, big ideas.\\" A Forced Exposure review stated: \\"With one foot in mainstream jazz... and the other, tentatively at times, in the avant-garde, this is a fascinating glimpse of Sanders's style before he wielded the unremitting fierceness of his playing with Coltrane and the modal mysticism of his later solo albums on Impulse.\\" Regardless of its reception, the album is historically important in that it \\"caught the ear of John Coltrane\\" and Sanders became a member of the group in September 1965.

Following her capture she was commissioned into the Royal Navy as a convoy escort for merchant vessels sailing between England and Quebec. Paid off in 1783, she was retained for harbour service in England until 1797 when she was sold into private hands. French service Danae was laid down in September 1762 at the naval foundry in Indret, later known as Nantes. Her design followed a standard architectural plan for 8-pounder frigates pioneered by shipwright Antoine Groignard, including increased stowage and a strengthened frame for longer service at sea. Despite being intended for use during the Seven Years' War against England, delays in construction meant she was not ready for launch until October 1763 eight months after the war itself had concluded with the Treaty of Paris.Winfield, p.216 As built, Danae was long with a keel, a beam of , and a hold depth of . Her armament comprised 32 8-pounder guns located along her gun deck, quarterdeck and forecastle. Her crew numbered 250 men. Placed back in active service for the Anglo-French War in 1779, she was selected to lead the naval escort for 1500 French troops in an attempted invasion of Jersey. Clowes, p.25 For this purpose she was put to sea in late April 1779, in the company of the 26-gun frigate Diane and four smaller gunships. On 1 May a landing at Saint Ouen, Jersey was thwarted by local militia and a detachment of Seaforth Highlanders, and the decision was made to return the fleet to Saint-Malo. However, word of the French landing had reached Portsmouth and a small British fleet was put to sea to cut off its withdrawal. The French and British fleets met at Coutances on 13 May. The French vessels had anchored under the protection of a small artillery battery on the coast, but chose not to give battle as the British approached. The frigate Diane raised sail escaped into the port but Danae and the four small craft were run aground, with their crews then fleeing overland. The British, commanded by Sir James Wallace in the 50-gun Royal Navy vessel HMS Experiment, silenced the battery and then went ashore to refloat Danae and three other craft. The captured vessels were all brought to Portsmouth Dockyard as prizes. British service Danae remained at anchor for the next six months while Admiralty contemplated her potential reuse. There were obstacles to returning her to service. First, her 8-pounder guns were considered a relic of previous wars in an era where 12- and 18-pounder naval cannons were common. Second, recent advances in frigate design had left Danae slower and less seaworthy than her contemporaries in British service, being more than 100 tons burthen larger than similar vessels without notable improvements in durability. Eventually she was recommissioned for convoy escort duties to British Quebec, making her first voyage as a Royal Navy vessel in May 1780 and remaining in active convoy service between England, Newfoundland and the West Indies, until the end of the war three years later. In late 1780 she overhauled and captured The Jack, a 14-gun American privateer which was brought into port in Quebec as a prize. Paid off in February 1783, Danae returned to England via Woolwich Dockyard to undergo minor repairs. There she was left at anchor with a skeleton crew as part of a nominal harbour service fleet. Never refitted for sea, the ageing vessel was finally decommissioned and sold at auction in October 1797.

She was well-known for her effective lobbying, close monitoring of lawmakers' voting habits, and her commanding presence. She died at the age of 66 from respiratory failure after hip surgery.  Early life  Simmons was born in Shreveport, Louisiana to M.M. Simmons and B.E. Simmons. and as a teen, she lived with her family in Winnsboro, Louisiana. She attended college at Southern University, a historically Black university in Baton Rouge, and earned a law degree from Howard University. Simmons also earned a marketing degree from the University of Illinois.  Career  Simmons joined the NAACP in the mid-1950s and worked in various capacities. She joined NAACP's West Coast division in 1961 and worked on issues related to voter registration.Jet (1986-09-15). Althea Simmons Moves to Disqualify Rehnquist. Vol. 70, no. 26.

As chief lobbyist for the NAACP in Washington D.C. from 1979 to 1990, Simmons exerted her influence on federal civil rights legislation. She helped to pass the 1982 extension and amendment of the Voting Rights Act, worked to make Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a holiday, and also advocated for legislation imposing sanctions on South Africa due to apartheid. Simmons noted that the observance of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday was an opportunity for white people to learn about race relations, as the history books provided scant information about civil rights. Simmons also argued against the appointment of William Rehnquist as Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, as she alleged that Rehnquist engaged in activities aimed at thwarting voter participation by African Americans and Latinos in the 1960s in Arizona. She also stated Rehnquist's subsequent record as an attorney and judge reflected a very narrow interpretation of the scope of the 14th Amendment and consistent opposition to civil rights laws. In her Senate testimony against Rehnquist's confirmation as chief justice, Simmons noted that \\"even though a person is a genius, if he lacks compassion, it distorts reality and cripples objectivity.\\" Simmons closely monitored the voting records of lawmakers, as she observed that \\"[i]t's not enough to just listen to the politicians at election time. Start monitoring how they vote. Often they will say something on the floor of the House or Senate just to get into the Congressional Record, but they vote just the opposite.\\" While hospitalized prior to her death, Simmons continued her work and helped lobby for the Civil Rights Act of 1990, which was passed by the United States Congress. It was vetoed by then-President of the United States George H. W. Bush about one month after her death. On September 17, 1990, four days after her death, U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy read a tribute to Simmons into the Senate's Congressional Record, where he referred to her as the \\"101st Senator on civil rights\\" and a \\"great champion in the continuing struggle to fulfill the constitutional promises of equal justice for all\\"  Personal  Simmons was an active member of the Asbury United Methodist Church in Washington D.C.

During the 12th century, its workshops were noted for their magnificent illuminated manuscripts. Soon after that, its monks were removed and the monastery became the home of a community of nuns. They occupied the site until the abolition of religious orders in Portugal during the 19th century. At the start of the 20th century, the buildings were converted into a psychiatric hospital, at the same time being declared a National Monument of the country. The hospital lasted a century and the government is currently developing the property into a museum of the sacred arts under the supervision of the architect Jo√£o Mendes Ribeiro. Early history The region became Muslim-held soon after the Muslim invasion of the Iberian peninsula in 711. Under the leadership of King Alfonso III of Asturias and his Castellan, Hermenegildo Guti√©rrez, they were driven out of the region of Coimbra in 878, when Guti√©rrez was made Count of Portugal. The monastery was dedicated to the Saints Mammes of Caesarea and Pelagius the Hermit. The community initially prospered as a major point of trade between the Christian inhabitants to its north and the Muslim kingdoms to its south. The monastery fell upon hard times when Muslim forces retook the territory in the following century. This lasted until the permanent retaking of the land in 1064 by King Ferdinand I of Le√≥n. At that point, the monastery was entrusted to the Benedictine monks of Cluny Abbey in France, who were made responsible for the agrarian development of the surrounding region. During the second half of the 12th century, major renovations of the monastery were undertaken by King Alfonso I. A new cloister and a larger church, with three naves, were erected. Under the leadership of Abbot Jo√£o (1162-1192) the scriptorium of the abbey became noted for their magnificent illuminated manuscripts. This abbey and the nearby Abbey of Santa Cruz, a community of canon regulars, became the preeminent producers of manuscripts in the young kingdom, in answer to a growing demand. Two major examples of this handicraft still survive, both illuminated by a monk named Egeas. One, known as the Book of Birds, a bestiary, is the illustration of a manuscript by the contemporary canon regular Hugues de Fouilloy and dated 1184. The other, known as the Apocalypse of Lorv√£o, is an illumination of the Commentary on the Apocalypse by Beatus of Li√©bana, an 8th century monk, dated 1189. Cistercian nuns In 1206, the marriage of King Alfonso IX of Le√≥n to Teresa of Portugal, daughter of King Sancho I of Portugal, was annulled by the Holy See due to consanguinity. She returned to her home, where her father gave her Lorv√£o Abbey. She chose to have the monks removed and established a community of 300 nuns, who were to live under the Cistercian Rule, with herself as abbess, though she herself was unable to take religious vows until after the death of her husband in 1230. The abbey was rededicated to Our Lady of Life. She died there in 1250 and was buried there, as had been her sister Sancha of Portugal (+1229), who had experienced a similar life story and had died as the Abbess of Celas. Major renovations of the abbey were undertaken on an ongoing basis during the 16-17th centuries, giving it a Baroque style. The new church (1748-1761) was designed by Mateus Vicente de Oliveira. Suppression A civil war broke out in Portugal 1828-1834. At its conclusion, the victorious Liberal government made the decision to end state sponsorship of religious communities. They were inspired by the Suppression of the Society of Jesus during the previous century. Thus in May 1834 King Pedro IV declared the Dissolution of the monasteries in Portugal, intending to sell the seized properties to provide for the poor. The first stage of the government action was applied only to communities of men, which were immediately suppressed. In 1862, the law was applied to communities of women, who were barred from accepting new members, and their assets became subject to seizure. The abbey library was seized in the early 1880's, when the above-noted manuscripts were transferred to the National Library. The last nun of the community died in 1887, ending the monastic life of the abbey. Legacy In the 20th century, the abbey was made into a psychiatric hospital. In 1910 the properties were declared a National Monument. The hospital was closed in 2012. It has been developed into a museum focusing on the sacred arts. 300px  References  Category:Christian monasteries established in the 9th century Category:Benedictine monasteries in Portugal Category:Roman Catholic churches in Coimbra Category:Tourist attractions in Coimbra Category:Cistercian monasteries in Portugal Category:1880s disestablishments in Portugal Category:National monuments in Coimbra District ","title":"Lorv√£o Abbey"},{"id":"64317087","text":"\\"Sonnet Written in the Church Yard at Middleton in Sussex,\\" also known as Charlotte Turner Smith's \\"Sonnet XLIV,\\" is Smith's most widely read and anthologized sonnet. The poem first appeared in the fifth edition of Smith's Elegiac Sonnets in 1789. Background The poem describes the sight of a thirteenth-century church in what is now known as Middleton-on-Sea in West Sussex. The churchyard of the poem's title was the church's cemetery. The area had been subject to substantial erosion since at least 1341, and preventative measures were employed in 1570 and 1779. In 1606 the church was approximately 170 yards from the high tide mark, but in 1724 the sea had encroached so much that the church was 20 yards from the edge. Smith visited the church in 1789, at which time the church was only a few feet from the shore, and the surrounding wall and many of the graves had eroded into the sea. Nonetheless, the church continued to be used until the building collapsed in 1838. In 1840, all that was visible was a two-foot fragment of wall, and by 1847 the church was entirely gone. A new church was consecrated nearby in 1849. The gradual collapse of the church was considered picturesque, and made the church into a minor tourist attraction. Several illustrations of the church appeared in The Gentleman's Magazine. Guidebooks and letters of tourists often referenced Smith's sonnet. Poem Pressed by the Moon, mute arbitress of tides, While the loud equinox its power combines, The sea no more its swelling surge confines, But o‚Äôer the shrinking land sublimely rides. The wild blast, rising from the western cave, Drives the huge billows from their heaving bed; Tears from their grassy tombs the village dead, And breaks the silent sabbath of the grave! With shells and sea-weed mingled, on the shore, Lo! their bones whiten in the frequent wave; But vain to them the winds and waters rave; They hear the warring elements no more: While I am doomed, by life‚Äôs long storm oppressed, To gaze with envy on their gloomy rest. Style The sonnet's rhyme scheme combines the octave and sestet structure of a Petrarchan sonnet with the concluding rhyming couplet of a Shakespearean sonnet. This gives it a first volta after line 8, where the poem's speaker turns from observing the destruction of the waves to the skeletons of the village dead, and a second volta after line 12, when the poem turns \\"inwards\\" to the speaker's own emotional experience. Reception William Wordsworth singled out Sonnet XLIV in his personal 1789 copy of Elegiac Sonnets. Wordsworth's own later sonnets were influenced by Smith, and he privately described her as \\"a lady to whom English verse is under greater obligations than are likely to be either acknowledged or remembered,\\" although he never discussed her works publicly. Wordsworth wrote on his copy to change the final line of Smith's poem from \\"To gaze with envy on their gloomy rest\\" to \\"To envy their insensible unrest.\\" NotesCitationsReferences  Category:Poems about death Category:18th-century poems Category:Sonnets ","title":"Sonnet Written in the Church Yard at Middleton"},{"id":"64317096","text":"Sherin Rai'd Kheiraldeen Al-Shalabe (born 3 June 1994) is a Jordanian footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for local Women's League club Shabab Al- Ordon and the Jordan women's national team.

He retired in May 2014. He is currently a Law Representative for Pillsbury Global in Iraq and the chief of the Nasrallah family.  Early life and education  Nasrallah was born on May 17, 1951, to Muhammad-Ali Nasrallah and Monira Tumah. Both of his parents hail from the noble Al Faiz family, and claim agnatic descent from Muhammad's daughter Fatimah and her husband, Ali, the first Shia Imam. Nasrallah was born in Karbala, and grew up there. He is the eldest of six children. His ancestors on some occasions ruled the city, and held custodianship of its holy sites. His brother, Haidar was executed by the Baathist regime in 1989.  Education  He moved to Baghdad in the late 1960s, and graduated with a bachelors in Law and Politics in 1972 from the University of Baghdad. He was conscripted into the military after he graduated from university, and appointed as a legal soldier, serving for just under two years. Nasrallah then worked as a judicial investigator in 1973, until he joined the Judicial Institute of Iraq in 1977 to become a judge. He graduated as a judge from the institute in 1979. He also graduated in supreme specialised studies from the same institute in 2000. Nasrallah was awarded with a certificate from the United Nations during a Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide course in 2003. Under a grant from the British Department for International Development, Nasrallah travelled, along with 139 other Iraqi judges, to Prague, to attend the Judging in a Democratic State course at the CEELI Institute. He attained a diploma from the institute in 2004. He also holds a diploma in Law Enforcement attained in Verbania, in 2005.  Career  He started his career as a judge in 1979, and worked in different courts across Iraq. Nasrallah participated in the 1991 uprising by supporting the rebels, and was eventually suspected by the Baathists and so was sent away from his hometown to work in cities in the north and south of Iraq.  Mayorship and Custodianship  Shortly after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a governance committee was formed to run Karbala, and so the members nominated Nasrallah as the new mayor that would replace Tali al-Douri. However Nasrallah turned down the city's request as he was focused on his career. Nasrallah was then assigned as a custodian of the Imam Husayn shrine, until a secretary general was appointed by Ayatollah Sistani, as part of the constitutional transition of the shrines' management from the sidana to the Shi'i Endowment Office. However, Nasrallah remained on the shrine's management board until January 14, 2014.  Court of Appeal  The Court of Appeal is the highest judicial and administrative body in Iraq. The head of the court is considered to be the head of justice in the province and a member of the Supreme Judicial Council. On October 20, 2003, Nasrallah was assigned as vice president of the Court of Appeal of Babil. A year later he became the president of the Court of Appeal of Wasit, and a member of the Supreme Judicial Council. In 2005, he established the Court of Appeal in Karbala and was assigned as its president. Two years later, he became the president of the Court of Appeal of al-Muthanna, until 2011.  Judicial Supervisory Authority  In 2011, he became a member of the Judicial Supervisory Authority of the Supreme Judicial Council. Nasrallah was responsible for monitoring the conduct of the judges and the staff in the courts of Babil, Wasit, Najaf and al- Qadissiyah. He remained a member of the commission, until he retired on May 27, 2014.  Technocratic Nomination  In 2016, Muqtada al-Sadr attempted to form a technocratic government along with Haider al-Abadi. For this campaign, Nasrallah was nominated as Minister of Justice, considering his political independence, and honourable reputation. However, due to the political chaos in Iraq, the plans for the government were not followed through.  Works  Nasrallah has produced three law studies: * The Obligatory Will: In Law and Jurispuridence (1987) * Laws of Absence (1993) * Protesting and Appealing Laws in Absentia (1999) The result of the first two studies caused amendments in the Iraqi Law of Personal Status.  Personal life  Nasrallah is married and has four children. His son Ali, teaches Computer Science at the University of Karbala.

Sheahan is formerly served as Sheriff of Cook County, Illinois and as a Chicago alderman. Early life Sheahan was born in 1944 or 1945. He received a Master of Education from Governors State University and a bachelor's degree from Saint Joseph's College. Early career Sheahan worked as a high school teacher and coach from 1967 through 1971. From 1971 through 1979, he worked as an officer for the Chicago Police Department. Chicago alderman In 1979, Sheahan was elected alderman from Chicago's 19th Ward, taking office in the Chicago City Council on April 16, 1979. He was reelected in 1983 and 1987. During the Council Wars of the mayoralty of Harold Washington, Sheahan was a member of the Vrdolyak 29, a bloc of alderman, led by Edward Vrdolyak, which stood in opposition to Washington. Amid the Washington mayoralty, Sheahan even spoke of possibly switching to the Republican Party. During the period in which Eugene Sawyer was mayor, he was considered supportive of the mayor. He was also considered a political ally of mayor Richard M. Daley. Cook County Sheriff=1990 election Corruption allegations had taken a toll on incumbent Republican James E. O'Grady's prospects for reelection. O'Grady ultimately had failed to live up to his 1986 campaign promises of disposing of politics and corruption in the Cook County Sheriff's Office, and had become unpopular among his constituents. Amid the 1990 campaign, a Cook County correctional officer was shot and critically wounded while hanging signs for Sheahan outside of the South Side bar. Three men, including a correctional officer who supported O'Grady, were arrested for this. This led to a decline of O'Grady's support in the polls. Additionally, an incident soon after occurred where Sheahan had a campaign office shot at. In 1990, Sheahan defeated O'Grady by a broad margin. O'Grady suffered one of biggest defeats that a Republican Party nominee had experienced in a countywide Cook County election in years. Sheahan had managed to beat O'Grady in 24 of the county's 30 suburban townships and in every ward of Chicago. Sheahan had even managed to carry many of the county's Republican strongholds. Tenure Sheahan was reelected in 1994, 1998, and 2002. Early into his tenure, he received praise for running what appeared to be a much less corrupt Sheriff's Office than his predecessors had. To \\"clean up\\" the office, he ended the practice of soliciting sheriff's workers for political contributions, and he fired dozens of \\"ghost workers\\" who were paid for no-show jobs. He also ended the long-corrupt part-time deputy program. Sheahan received praise for programs such as a boot camp for first-time offenders. He also received criticism over abuse of inmates by jail guards. Sheahan regularly butted heads with members of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. In November 2005, he announced that he would not be seeking reelection the following year. His term would end in December 2006. Personal life Shehan and his wife Nancy have six children, Katie, Michael, Terrence, Timothy, Patrick, and Ryan. His brother James \\"Skinny\\" Sheahan is a civic leader on Chicago's Southwest Side. Richard M. Daley appointed him as Chicago's Director of Special Events in 1993. He would long serve as a Daley aid. James sits on the board of Special Olympics Chicago.

Early life Sissoko was born in Bafoulab√©, a rural commune in Mali, where he grew up without electricity, running water, cars or radios. He worked by hand on his family's farm, as his village did not have modern farming equipment. At age 15, Sissoko's basketball potential drew the attention of Michael Clayton, administrator of the Utah Valley Eye Center, who was making an annual trip to Africa with doctors performing free cataract surgeries on villagers. Sissoko's brother, a member of the doctors' armed security personnel, had asked Clayton about the possibility of Sissoko attending school and playing basketball in the United States.

He played most of his career as a left back or midfielder, although he was capable of playing as a winger if needed. With over 120 caps, he has achieved cult status at Guaratinguet√°. He is also the fifth most capped player in S√£o Bernardo FC history, featuring in 125 matches and being the team captain in the club's first ever championship win.  Club career  Renato started his career at the youth ranks of Botafogo, playing as a midfielder, but he made his senior debut for Bragantino, playing in the 1999 Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie B. After leaving the Bragan√ßa Paulista club, he signed for Campeonato Potiguar side S√£o Gon√ßalo in 2000. Under head coach Paulo Moroni, he ended up scoring three goals during the tournament and helping the club finish second overall. His play caught the attention of Am√©rica de Natal, which promptly signed Renato Peixe to play in the Copa Jo√£o Havelange Group Yellow. He returned to S√£o Gon√ßalo the next year, finishing the 2001 Campeonato Potiguar as the club's top scorer, netting five goals. Nevertheless, Renato Peixe's offensive style of play got him a move to Figueirense in the S√©rie B. He became a starting midfielder under Gilmar da Costa, but lost his starting spot after suffering a groin injury. He was part of the roster that finished second and achieved promotion back to the first division. On 17 July 2002, he was released by Figueirense. He then signed for Fortaleza for the remainder of the year. He scored two goals in his Campeonato Cearense debut, leading his new club to a 3‚Äì1 win over Boa Viagem on 18 July. He would score again on 29 July, in a 3‚Äì1 victory over bitter rivals Cear√°. Renato Peixe played in 12 of the 29 games in the Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie B as the Le√£o do Pici won promotion to the 2003 S√©rie A. After brief spells with Cor√≠ntians de Caic√≥, ABC and Campinense, on 29 June 2004 he joined S√©rie C club Treze. Renato Peixe was signed by Joinville on 8 November 2004, helping the club to a fourth place on the 2005 Campeonato Catarinense. He renewed his contract for the S√©rie A2 later that year, in which Joinville were crowned champions. After a stint with Juventus, he joined Botafogo de Ribeir√£o Preto in 2006.  Ferrovi√°ria  On 4 January 2007, Renato Peixe was signed by Ferrovi√°ria, reuniting him with head coach Edison S√≥, with whom he had won the Paulista A3 with Botafogo de Ribeir√£o Preto. The one-year-deal saw him play in the Campeonato Paulista S√©rie A3 and the Copa do Brasil, as well as in the Copa FPF. On 28 January, he made his debut away to Flamengo de Guarulhos as a late game substitute. He made his first start on February 17, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1‚Äì0 win at the Fonte Luminosa against Catanduvense. Peixe would be named again in the starting lineup on 4 March in a 1‚Äì0 home win over XV de Piracicaba and on April 15 in a 3‚Äì3 away draw against Votoraty, as Ferrovi√°ria finished the first stage at the top of the table. On 2 May, he was once again named among the starters for the match against Linense, relegating then first-choice left back Fernando Lu√≠s to the bench. He was the in the starting lineup in all games for the remainder of the second stage, in which Ferrinha achieved promotion but didn't advance to the finals. For the 2007 Copa FPF, Renato Peixe was moved to the midfield and given the number 10 shirt. On 1 August, he scored his lone goal for Ferrovi√°ria in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Botafogo de Ribeir√£o Preto at Santa Cruz. He was later moved back to defence by manager Edison S√≥ for the remainder of the competition, failing to be constantly figured in the starting XI.  S√£o Bernardo  S√©rie A3 side S√£o Bernardo FC signed Renato Peixe from Ferrovi√°ria for the 2008 season. He scored his first goal for the club on his Serie A3 debut against Independente de Limeira in a 1‚Äì1 away tie on 27 January 2008. On 8 March, Renato Peixe scored his first hat-trick for S√£o Bernardo in a 4‚Äì1 win against Votoraty. Peixe became a valuable player for the club during the season, being played as a left winger by manager Lelo. He scored eight goals during the first stage and helped the club finish fourth, advancing to the second stage. On 17 May, Renato Peixe opened the scoring for Bern√¥ in a 3‚Äì1 home victory against Linense. Eight days later, he would score again against the same opponent, improving his goal tally to 10 on the year as his team won 4‚Äì1 at Gilbert√£o. S√£o Bernardo took first place in a group that also featured Linense, Votoraty and Oeste Paulista, achieving promotion for the S√©rie A2 for the first time and qualifying for the finals against Flamengo de Guarulhos. In the first leg of the S√©rie A3 finals, on 8 June, Renato Peixe scored from a free kick in the 39th minute to tie the game 1‚Äì1 at 1¬∫ de Maio. He would score again in the second leg, opening the scoring in the 24th minute, converting a penalty suffered by Raul. Flamengo would tie the game sixteen minutes later, giving the Guarulhos team the trophy, as they had the better overall record after the two legs ended in a tie. Renato finished the S√©rie A3 as the club's top goalscorer, finding the back of the net 12 times during the tournament. During the second half of the year, S√£o Bernardo played in the Copa Paulista. The club's performance was not very positive, being eliminated in the first stage, having accumulated seven defeats in 14 games. Renato would go on to score five more goals during the competition, bringing his season totals to 17. Renato Peixe stayed with the S√£o Bernardo do Campo club for the 2009 Campeonato Paulista S√©rie A2. He was a starter in the first game of the year, a 1‚Äì2 home defeat to Rio Branco on 24 January 2009. He had an eventful game a week later against Ferrovi√°ria: he netted an own goal in the 28th minute, only to score from the penalty spot seven minutes later to tie the game, which would end 2‚Äì1, giving S√£o Bernardo their first ever S√©rie A2 win. He continued to be featured on the left wing after the departure of Lelo, only missing one S√©rie A2 match after picking up three yellow cards. However, his offensive production ended up being considerably smaller than previous season's, as he would only score again on 25 March in a 2‚Äì1 come- from-behind victory over Atl√©tico Sorocaba. Under Luciano Dias, Renato Peixe was given the number 10 shirt and was an undisputed starter for the beginning of the Copa Paulista later that year. But as the year went on, he fell out of favor with the new manager and was deemed surplus by the end of the year, prompting a move out of Tigre. He finished the season with 38 games played and 4 goals scored in all competitions.  Guaratinguet√°  Renato joined newly promoted S√©rie B side Guaratinguet√° for the 2010 season. In his new club, he made the switch back to defence under coach Nedo Xavier and later Lu√≠s Carlos Martins. On 13 January 2010, he scored his first goal for Guar√° in his S√©rie A2 debut for the club, in a 1‚Äì1 away draw to Votoraty. His display in that game put him in the Team of the Week. On 21 January he had an assist and scored a late game-winning goal to help his team overcome a one-goal deficit and defeat S√£o Bento at Walter Ribeiro, earning him his second appearance in the Team of The Week. On 24 January, he led Guar√° to a 3‚Äì1 home win over Taquaritinga with two assists in the game, but was sent off before the final whistle, making him miss the next match. He made the Team of the Week for the third time on 13 February, following a 1‚Äì1 home draw against Linense. On 21 February, he had an assist and scored the third goal as Guaratinguet√° beat Noroeste 3‚Äì0, winning him a fourth Team of the Week spot. On 17 April, Peixe scored in the 75th minute to secure an away draw in a derby against S√£o Jos√©. He would later acknowledge that as one of the most important matches he scored on. His play helped Guaratinguet√° win promotion to the state league first division after just one year in the second tier. Renato's seven goals during the tournament put him as the club's second top goalscorer, and he was voted by journalists as the best left-back of the tournament. Peixe would be a mainstay for Guar√° during the 2010 S√©rie B as well. He scored twice in his first national match for the club on 8 May, helping Guaratinguet√° to a 3‚Äì1 home win against Duque de Caxias, the first three points ever won by the Gar√ßa in S√©rie B history. On 29 May he put on a decisive performance against Santo Andr√©, netting the first goal of the match and assisting Nen√™ on the second as his team won 3‚Äì1 at Dario Rodrigues Leite. He made 33 appearances for the club during the league, all of them as a starter on the left side of the defense, netting seven goals as Guaratinguet√° avoided relegation by just one point.  Mirassol  In December 2010, it was announced Renato Peixe signed a short deal with Mirassol to play for the club during the Paulist√£o. On 16 January 2011, he made his debut against Ponte Preta, a game Mirassol went on to win 2‚Äì1. He played 74 minutes before being replaced by Diego. Although he was chosen as the starting left back for the first two games, Peixe was subbed out in both matches and was later relegated to the bench in favor of Diego. After 14 games, head coach Ivan Baitello put him in the starting lineup on April 3, as he played 72 minutes before being replaced by Marcelinho in a 0‚Äì1 loss to S√£o Paulo at Arena Barueri. On 17 April, he played the full 90 minutes for the only time during his tenure with Mirassol, in a 0‚Äì3 away loss to Botafogo de Ribeir√£o Preto.  Return to S√£o Bernardo  His return to Tigre was announced on 31 May 2011, as he signed a one-year contract with the club, reuniting him with manager Luis Carlos Martins. Peixe made his Copa Paulista return for S√£o Bernardo in a 1‚Äì2 defeat away to Juventus, playing the full 90 minutes as a left back. He scored his first two goals in his second spell at 1¬∫ de Maio on 7 August, leading Bern√¥ to a 2‚Äì1 away win against S√£o Jos√©. On 9 November 2011, Renato made his 100th S√£o Bernardo appearance in a 0‚Äì2 loss to Comercial at Santa Cruz. Renato started in 25 games and scored a total three goals, as S√£o Bernardo was eliminated by Comercial in the Copa Paulista semifinals. Renato Peixe was S√£o Bernardo's team captain for the 2012 Paulista S√©rie A2. He was a starter in their first game of the season, a 0‚Äì1 defeat against S√£o Carlos. His first goal of the year was scored on 4 February, as he converted a penalty kick suffered by Danielzinho in a 1‚Äì2 home loss to Atl√©tico Sorocaba. On 11 February, he helped Bern√¥ win their first game of the season after five consecutive losses, scoring the third goal in a 4‚Äì2 victory against Uni√£o S√£o Jo√£o. A week later, he scored from the penalty spot to secure a 1‚Äì0 win over Santacruzense. He scored again the following match, against Penapolense. On 5 May, after missing a penalty shot earlier in the first leg of the S√©rie A2 finals against Uni√£o Barbarense, Renato Peixe converted an injury time penalty kick to tie the game at 1‚Äì1. After another draw in the second leg, S√£o Bernardo won their first title in club history, as Renato Peixe lifted the Paulista S√©rie A2 trophy as team captain. He finished the tournament with six goals in 24 appearances.  Return to Guaratinguet√°  In June 2012, Renato Peixe left S√£o Bernardo for a second stint with Guaratinguet√° in the Brasileir√£o S√©rie B. He was named team captain on his return. He made his return for Guar√° on 16 June after coming on as a 67th- minute substitute in a 1‚Äì0 away defeat against Bragantino. Under new manager Pintado, Renato Peixe started for the first time in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Ava√≠, on 23 June. His first goal came on 28 August against Crici√∫ma, opening the scoring in a 2‚Äì1 home win. On 17 November, he set up the first goal and scored the second as Guaratinguet√° beat Ipatinga 3‚Äì2 at Ipating√£o. On 24 November, Renato Peixe played a crucial part in helping Guaratinguet√° escape relegation, as he scored a header against Barueri, ensuring a 2‚Äì1 win in the last matchday, which moved the team out of the relegation zone. He ended his first season back with Guaratinguet√° with four goals and one assist in 26 S√©rie B appearances. He was a regular starter for the 2013 Paulista S√©rie A2. On 23 January, Renato Peixe scored Guaratinguet√°'s opening goal of the season and assisted Wellington Pimenta as their team started the year with a 3‚Äì1 away win against S√£o Carlos. On 31 March 2013, Renato Peixe made his 100th appearance with Guaratinguet√° in a 0‚Äì0 home draw against Rio Claro, in the final matchday of the S√©rie A2 first stage. He made 24 appearances and scored eight goals in Paulista S√©rie A2, finishing as the club's joint-top goalscoarer alongside strikers Jonatas Belusso and Douglas Tanque. Renato Peixe played 29 matches in the 2013 Brasileir√£o S√©rie B, having scored five goals and provided a single assist during the league. He was Guaratinguet√°'s second most capped player in the competition, behind goalkeeper Saulo and was the club's top goalscorer alongside Jonatas Belusso. Unlike in the previous season, Guaratinguet√° didn't avoid relegation to S√©rie C, finishing 17th on the table.  Santo Andr√©  On 2 December 2013, Renato Peixe became Santo Andr√©'s third signing for the 2014 season. He made his first start for Ramalh√£o on 25 January in a 2‚Äì0 home win over his former team Guaratinguet√°, being replaced in the 77th minute by Ramalho. On 12 April, Renato Peixe scored for the first time for Santo Andr√© in a derby against bitter rivals S√£o Caetano, netting the third goal in a 3‚Äì1 win. He was a regular starter for the club in the S√©rie A2, having made 18 appearances and recording two assists as the club finished a respectable 6th place. = S√£o Caetano (loan) = As his wages were deemed too high for Copa Paulista standards, Renato Peixe was loaned together with three more players to S√£o Caetano for the 2014 Brasileir√£o S√©rie C. At Anacleto Campanella, he was reunited with former Santo Andr√© manager Vilson Taddei. He made his Azul√£o debut on 27 April against Guarani. Renato Peixe's only goal for S√£o Caetano came on 24 August, as he scored from the penalty spot in a 2‚Äì0 home win over Caxias. He returned to Santo Andr√© at the end of the year. Renato Peixe was a starter in 14 games for Ramalh√£o's 2015 S√©rie A2 campaign, but failing to score a single goal.  S√£o Jos√©  On 25 June 2015, Renato Peixe signed a six-month deal with S√£o Jos√©. He made his Copa Paulista debut for the club on 18 July, playing the full 90 minutes in a goalless draw against Juventus. He made four more appearances as the √Åguia do Vale lost the following seven games and finished the cup with the worst record overall.  Monte Azul  Renato Peixe joined Monte Azul for the 2016 Paulista S√©rie A2. He was reunited once again with Edison S√≥, his former manager at Botafogo and Ferrovi√°ria. On 20 February, Renato Peixe made his debut in a 2‚Äì0 away defeat to Atl√©tico Sorocaba. On 9 March, he scored from the penalty spot in a 2‚Äì1 win over Batatais, which was his only goal for Monte Azul. He made 13 appearances during the competition as Monte Azul finished 16th and was demoted to S√©rie A3 the next season.  S√£o Jos√© dos Campos  In January 2017, aged 37, he signed for Paulista S√©rie A3 club S√£o Jos√© dos Campos, looking to provide veteran leadership to a group of youngsters. Renato Peixe was named the club captain for the competition and was given the number 8 shirt. He made his debut on 29 January, playing the full 90 minutes and appearing as a playmaking midfielder in a 0‚Äì1 defeat to his former club Monte Azul. On 8 February Renato Peixe scored his first S√£o Jos√© dos Campos goal in a last-minute penalty kick to secure a 1‚Äì0 away win over Matonense. He was sent off in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Nacional on 20 February for insulting match official Jos√© Roberto Marques following a yellow card. After serving a one-game suspension, he was back in the starting lineup for the 5 March clash against Portuguesa Santista, scoring a penalty kick for the team's lone goal in a 1‚Äì3 loss. Renato Peixe netted his third league goal for S√£o Jos√© dos Campos on 19 March, scoring a last-minute equalizer from the penalty spot in a 1‚Äì1 home draw against Desportivo Brasil, helping his team move up one spot on the standings. He picked up a third yellow card during a 0‚Äì1 away defeat to Comercial on 26 March, which got him out of the next match against Inter de Limeira. He would go on to score twice in a 5‚Äì0 thrashing of Mar√≠lia at Martins Pereira, netting the Tigre do Vale's third goal from a Michael pass into the 6-yard box in the 72nd minute, and the closing goal from a penalty kick, eight minutes later. He left S√£o Jos√© dos Campos at the end of the 2017 Paulista S√©rie A3, featuring in 17 league matches and scoring five goals, the second most in the team. The club, however, ended up being relegated, falling victim to the new S√©rie A3 rules which were created to reduce the number of teams in the division. S√£o Jos√© dos Campos finished 16th with 24 points in 19 games.  Style of play  Renato Peixe played most of his career as a left‚Äìsided full-back or wing-back. He was a very offensive-minded player, constantly making runs down the field and cutting inside to shoot. In spite of being a defender, he was a prolific goal scorer for both Treze and S√£o Bernardo.  Managerial career = S√£o Bernardo FC  In May 2017, Renato Peixe became assistant coach of S√£o Bernardo, working alongside his former S√£o Bernardo teammate Wilson J√∫nior. Renato and Wilson also worked together at Monte Azul, as the former was head coach of the club and the latter was a player. S√£o Bernardo played in the 2017 Brasileir√£o S√©rie D, achieving a respectable 9th place in the final standings, after being eliminated by S√£o Jos√©-RS in a penalty shootout in the third stage of the league. The team also did well the following season, narrowly missing promotion in the 2018 Campeonato Paulista S√©rie A2 but not going past the second stage in the 2018 Copa Paulista. In October 2018, Wilson, Renato and fitness coach Deivid Marques signed with fellow S√©rie A2 side Nacional, but after two months and no official matches, the trio returned to Tigre. On 10 February 2019, they were fired from S√£o Bernardo, following a six-game winless streak to start the 2019 Paulist√£o S√©rie A2.  EC S√£o Bernardo  Shortly after his dismissal from S√£o Bernardo, he was signed by their crosstown rivals, EC S√£o Bernardo. Initially, Renato Peixe served as assistant coach under Oliveira and R√©gis Angeli. When Angeli resigned on 2 July 2019, Renato Peixe took over as caretaker manager. His first game in charge was a 0‚Äì1 defeat against Gr√™mio Osasco in the Copa Paulista. On 12 July, he was named as the new manager of Esporte Clube S√£o Bernardo. Under Renato Peixe, the Cachorr√£o achieved their best ever Copa Paulista finish, reaching the semifinals before being eliminated by fellow ABC Region side and eventual champions S√£o Caetano. Before the 2020 Campeonato Paulista S√©rie A3 was stopped by the COVID-19 pandemic, EC S√£o Bernardo were second on the league table, six points behind league leaders Noroeste.  Personal life  Renato got his nickname Peixe during his years at Bragantino. As the club had another player with the same name as him, he got nicknamed Peixe (Fish, in Portuguese) due to being from Rio de Janeiro, where Peixe is a slang term meaning mate or pal. He was a Flamengo supporter during his childhood, and his footballing idol was Zico.

The House of Sacadura Botte as it exists today originated from the marriage in 1686 of Jo√£o Baptista de Aguiar e Azevedo, son and heir of Mateus Gomes de Aguiar, and D. Maria de Proen√ßa de Azevedo Pacheco de Sacadura Botte, sister and heir of Manuel Pacheco de Sacadura Botte, 8th Lord of Alameda and head of Spanish House of Sacadura Botte. Upon the latter's death without issue, the members of the Portuguese House of Sacadura Botte matrilineally inherited the surnames, arms, and patrimonial possessions of the extinct Spanish House of Sacadura Botte. The Spanish House of Sacadura Botte, in turn, had originated from the 16th century marriage of a member of the House of Botte, which took its name from El Botte, a dehesa on which its seat of Castle of Belv√≠s de Monroy is built; and the female heir of a cadet branch of the House of Alvarado, which was originally called House of Sacadura after the village of Secadura in which its seat, the Tower of Alvarado, was located.  The House of Gomes de Aguiar  Mateus Gomes de Aguiar was born in 1628, and at age 20 he sailed to Bahia, Brazil, under the orders of the 2nd Count of Castelo Melhor, who was Governor of Brazil from 1650 to 1654. During his stay in Bahia, he took part in the Dutch‚ÄìPortuguese War and rose to prominence in a naval battle against the Dutch in 1651. As a result, and at the Count of Castelo Melhor's behest, he was elevated to the nobility in 1653.ANTT, Matr√≠cula dos Moradores da Casa Real, Liv. 5, f. 674 v.¬∫ e 675 His eldest son, Jo√£o Baptista de Aguiar e Azevedo, married thrice, to three heiresses from different families. Although he had male issue from all three wives, the heirs from each of his marriages adopted their mother's surnames in order to succeed in the patrimonial possessions of their corresponding mothers' families. In doing so, they created three cadet branches of the House of Gomes de Aguiar: Pereira de Azevedo e Vasconcelos, Macedo Sottomayor e Castro, and Sacadura Botte. Upon the extinction in the male line of both the remaining Gomes de Aguiar lines and the Pereira de Azevedo e Vasconcelos and Macedo Sottomayor e Castro cadet branches, the Sacadura Botte branch became the main agnatic line, and the name Gomes de Aguiar fell into disuse in its favor. In an anecdotal testament to the Portuguese Empire's longevity and extent, Mateus Gomes de Aguiar and his agnatic descendants served Portugal across four centuries in three continents. Notably: * His grandson Jos√© Pereira de Vasconcelos, Captain-at-Sea, served and died in the Portuguese State of India; * His great- grandson Dom Jos√© de Macedo Sottomayor e Castro, Captain of Dragoons, served and died in S√£o Paulo, Brazil; and * His patrilineal descendant Theodorico de Sacadura Botte was a colonial administrator in Mozambique.  Legacy  A few roads in the Beira Region are named after the House of Sacadura Botte or its members, such as the \\"Rua Sacadura Botte\\" and \\"Beco Sacadura Botte\\" (both located in the village of Aguieira), the \\"Rua Dr. Jos√© Maria de Sacadura Botte\\" (located in the village of Santa Comba), the \\"Ponte Sacadura Botte\\" and \\"Avenida Jos√© de Sacadura Botte\\" (both in the village of Arrifana), or another \\"Rua Sacadura Botte\\" (this one located in the village of Tramaga). The 16th century Quinta de S√£o Sim√£o da Aguieira, seat of the House of Sacadura Botte for the better part of three centuries, was sold at the end of the 20th century and is now a monument bearing the name \\"Sacadura Botte Manor\\". Main gate of Quinta da Bica Likewise, the Quinta da Bica, seat of the cadet branch of the House of Sacadura Botte known as the Viscounts of Sardoal, is a Grade 2 Listed Building (Im√≥vel de Interesse P√∫blico), and is the only residential listed building in the Seia region which remains in the hands of the original family.http://www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt/pt/patrimonio/patrimonio- imovel/pesquisa-do-patrimonio/classificado-ou-em-vias-de- classificacao/geral/view/73388 In Coimbra, the Sacadura Botte name is still present in the eponymous palace, which was inhabited by members of the family until 1972, when it was ceded to the University of Coimbra.

She works as a commercial litigator in Melbourne and is a regular media commentator. Early life and education Nyuon was born in the Itang refugee camp in Ethiopia in 1987, where she lived until the age of four. The family was forced to leave the camp due to conflict in Ethiopia, taking 40 days to walk back to an area then in southern Sudan (since 2011, part of South Sudan). Not long after arrival, Nyuon was separated from her mother. She rarely saw her father, Commander William Nyuon Bany, one of the founders of the Sudan People‚Äôs Liberation Army, as he was away fighting, and died in 1996. She was raised by various step-mothers in Nairobi, Lodwar and at the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya, where she did her primary and secondary schooling. It was also at Kakuma where she was inspired by the work of UNHCR lawyers and decided that she too wanted to be a lawyer. Her mother came and found her after her father's death and when she was about 14 years old, and brought her other siblings to Kakuma. Eight of them lived in a mud house. In 2005 the family was accepted as migrants to Australia, and Nyuon was 18 years old when they arrived in Melbourne, penniless. After attaining her Victorian Certificate of Education, she earned a Bachelor of Arts at Victoria University before being accepted into Melbourne Law School at the University of Melbourne, where she achieved Juris Doctor. She was helped to achieve a scholarship by one of her professors, and was later given $10,000 by a woman she met by chance at a dinner, who was touched by her story. The generous donor was a retired graphic designer Juliet Tootell, who later became a close friend and godmother to her daughter. Career Nyuon works as a commercial litigator for law firm Arnold Bloch Leibler. She was drawn into fighting for the rights of African Australians after a number of racist incidents targeting her, her friends and others. She was trolled mercilessly after speaking out about Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton's allegation in 2018 that Victorians were ‚Äúscared to go out in restaurants‚Äù because of ‚ÄúAfrican gang violence‚Äù. She is determined to create a fairer Australia, pointing out the serious effects of racism on the victim's health. Nyuon is also a writer, a regular media commentator on programs such as ABC‚Äôs The Drum and Q + A , a volunteer and a keynote speaker. She has written for The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Saturday Paper, The Guardian the Australasian Review of African Studies, Australian Mosaic (quarterly magazine published by the Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia) and Offset (Victoria University‚Äôs annual literary magazine). After an appearance on Q+A on 15 June 2020, Nyuon was sent abusive messages on Facebook which were later found to have come from a serving police officer in South Australia Police. After this had come to light, the officer was put onto administrative duties and became the subject of an internal investigation. She said that she was regularly sent abusive messages after appearing on television, and would be taking some time off. In September 2020 Nyuon was appointed chair of Harmony Alliance: Migrant and Refugee Women for Change, a national coalition of migrant and refugee women in Australia.

The two expectations are: # Since the disease would have otherwise caused some deaths, there should be fewer deaths if the disease is cured than in the world where the disease is not cured # Since everyone dies eventually, there must in the long run be the same number of deaths, and the deaths will be redistributed among the remaining causes. The paradox was named after Conrad Taeuber, a sociologist and demographer  Resolution  The paradox is resolved by noting that the life expectancy of the population will increase when the disease is cured, leading to a temporary decrease in the overall death rate before deaths are reapportioned among other causes. Thus, curing a disease will not cause an overall decrease in population mortality, but can improve mortality in certain groups (e.g. at certain ages) within a population, or even across all groups (e.g. all ages) within the populations. Comparing two populations with the same overall mortality while one has lower mortality in each subgroup is an example of Simpson's paradox. In the special case where the force of mortality is reduced by a constant fraction X, then the increase in life expectancy can be roughly estimated as X * H * e, where e is the life expectancy before the reduction in mortality and H is estimated as (2 - e / a), where a is the stationary age of the population. As an example, if cancer is responsible for 10% of all deaths at all ages and were suddenly cured, in a population with an expected lifespan of 75 years and an average age of 50 (giving an estimated H of 1/2), we'd estimate life expectancy to increase by only 3.75 years (5% of the original life expectancy, rather than the larger 10% increase you might expect intuitively). As of 2005, H was estimated to be around 0.2 and 0.15 for men and women respectively in European and American countries with life expectancy of around 70, a significant decrease from estimates of 0.3 to 0.4 from 30 years earlier, which indicates that now more people live to near their life expectancy, and that a decrease in mortality would now result in a smaller increase in life expectancy. Based on US government estimates using 1989 life table data, eliminating death from all malignant neoplasms would increase US life expectancy at birth by 3.36 years, while eliminating deaths from all major cardiovascular diseases would increase life expectancy at birth by 6.73 years.

In 2018, Morrison was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship for research on the Jewish scholarly intermediaries between the Ottoman Empire and Renaissance Italy. In 2019, Morrison was a Distinguished Visitor at UC Berkeley. His recent book, The Light of the World: Astronomy in al-Andalus studied scientific theories which were produced in Andalusia in 1400, and traveled first to the Ottoman court and then to the University of Padua, Italy. His research has also been supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities and by fellowships at the Stanford Humanities Center and the National Humanities Center.  Research on aspects of the history of Islamic science  Morrison's doctoral research uncovered the scientific contributions of Nisaburi. Nisaburi was a scholar of religious sciences and astronomy and was influenced by influential scholars Nasir al-Din al-Tusi and Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi. His doctoral research addressed the historical interactions between Islam and science. The main thrust of Morrison's research has been the connection between the scientific culture of the Ottoman Empire and the science of the Renaissance. His work elucidates the connections between Islamic astronomy and Copernican astronomy. In a 2018 interview, he stated \\"what I‚Äôm doing is finding organic connections between the two worlds.\\" Morrison's research has discovered a network of Jewish scholars who traveled between the Turkish Ottoman Empire and the V√®neto in northeastern Italy. A key figure in his research is a Jewish scholar named Moses Galeano. Galeano brought Islamic astronomy to Venice and Padua. His current book project An Economy of Knowledge in the Eastern Mediterranean addresses the question of intellectual exchange between Islamic societies and the West in the 1400s and early 1500s.

Ingalls Peak is the highest point in the Teanaway area of the Wenatchee Mountains. It is situated west of Mount Stuart, and immediately west of Lake Ingalls, on land managed by Wenatchee National Forest. Its subpeaks are the South Peak (7,640-ft, 2,329-m) and the East Peak (7,480-ft, 2,280-m). Precipitation runoff from the peak drains north into Jack Creek, a tributary of Icicle Creek; west into Fortune Creek; or east into Ingalls Creek, a tributary of the Wenatchee River. This peak, the lake, creek, and pass are named for Captain Benjamin Ingalls of the United States Cavalry who led an 1855 survey of this area and is credited with discovering gold in the region.Barnes, Nathan and Jeremy, Alpine Lakes Wilderness: The Complete Hiking Guide, Mountaineers Books. 2019. Climbing Ingalls Peak is a popular climbing destination because of its generally sound peridotite rock and relatively easy access. The North Peak is the highest, and its easiest climbing route is rated by either the Southwest Face or East Ridge. The first ascent was made in 1925 by a party of The Mountaineers. The South Ridge is a popular route, class 5.4 rating. This route was first climbed by Keith Lankin and Ken Solberg on May 30, 1941. The Southeast Face was first climbed in June 1956 by Lex Maxwell and Bob McCall. The South Peak is the easiest ascent, involving only class 3 scrambling. The East Peak is a classic horn shape, and the most difficult to reach the top, minimum class 5 climbing. This summit was first climbed by Gene Prater, Bill Prater, and Stan Butcharc in November 1952. There are established routes on the South Face, Southwest Face, and Dike Chimney - East Ridge. Climate Lying east of the Cascade crest, the area around Ingalls Peak is a bit drier than areas to the west. Summers can bring warm temperatures and occasional thunderstorms. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the western slopes of the Cascades experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

III, p. 1171 (\\"Trebonia Gens\\"). Origin The nomen Trebonius belongs to a large class of gentilicia formed using the suffix ', originally applied to cognomina ending in ', but later used as a regular gentile-forming suffix, and applied in cases for which there was no morphological justification. These gentes were largely plebeian, and the form Terebonius strongly hints at an Oscan origin.Chase, pp. 119, 120. Branches and cognomina The Trebonii of the Republic bore no hereditary surnames, but a few had personal cognomina, such as Asper, bestowed upon Lucius Trebonius, the plebeian tribune of 448 BC. Translating \\"rough, harsh, rude\\", or \\"annoying\\", this surname alluded to Trebonius' determined pursuit of reforms favouring the plebeians.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s.v. asper. Members * Lucius Trebonius, surnamed Asper, as tribune of the plebs in 448 BC, carried a law, the lex Trebonia, requiring that the comitia should not be dismissed until the full complement of ten plebeian tribunes had been elected. Prior to this, vacancies were filled by co-optation, leaving the office open to political influence, which had resulted in two patricians being chosen as tribunes of the plebs in the previous year.Livy, iii. 65, v. 10.Broughton, vol. I, p. 50. * Gnaeus Trebonius, tribune of the plebs in 401 BC, opposed the co-optation of two of his colleagues, in violation of the lex Trebonia. Though unsuccessful in this regard, the plebeian tribunes of this year did pass an agrarian law.Livy, v. 11.Broughton, vol.

He became a trusted lieutenant of Caesar, by whose favour he became consul suffectus in October of 45. He was one of the chief conspirators against Caesar in the following year, for which he was highly praised by Cicero.

It was translated from a German-language book, Kombinatorische Geometrie in der Ebene, which its authors Hugo Hadwiger and Hans Debrunner published through the University of Geneva in 1960, expanding a 1955 survey paper that Hadwiger had published in L'Enseignement math√©matique. Victor Klee translated it into English, and added a chapter of new material. It was published in 1964 by Holt, Rinehart and Winston, and republished in 1966 by Dover Publications.

Jaglom and including a summary of the new material by Klee, was published by Nauka in 1965. The Basic Library List Committee of the Mathematical Association of America has recommended its inclusion in undergraduate mathematics libraries. Topics The first half of the book provides the statements of nearly 100 propositions in the discrete geometry of the Euclidean plane, and the second half sketches their proofs. Klee's added chapter, lying between the two halves, provides another 10 propositions, including some generalizations to higher dimensions, and the book concludes with a detailed bibliography of its topics. Results in discrete geometry covered by this book include: *Carath√©odory's theorem that every point in the convex hull of a planar set belongs to a triangle determined by three points of the set, and Steinitz's theorem that every point interior to the convex hull is interior to the convex hull of four points of the set. *The Erd≈ës‚ÄìAnning theorem, that if an infinite set of points in the plane has an integer distance between every two points, then the given points must all lie on a single line. *Helly's theorem, that if a family of compact convex sets has a non-empty intersection for every triple of sets, then the whole family has a non-empty intersection. *A Helly-like property of visibility related to the art gallery theorem: if every three points of a polygon are visible from some common point within the polygon, then there is a point from which the entire polygon is visible. In this case the polygon must be a star-shaped polygon. *The impossibility of covering a closed parallelogram by three translated copies of its interior, and the fact that every other compact convex set can be covered in this way. *Jung's theorem, that (for sets in the plane) the radius of the smallest enclosing circle is at most 1/\\\\sqrt{3} times the diameter. This bound is tight for the equilateral triangle. *Paradoxes of set decomposition into smaller sets, related to the Banach‚ÄìTarski paradox. *Radon's theorem that every four points in the plane can be partitioned into two subsets with intersecting convex hulls. *Sperner's lemma on colorings of triangulations. *The Sylvester‚ÄìGallai theorem, in the form that if a finite set of points in the plane has the property that every line through two of the points contains a third point from the set, then the given points must all lie on a single line. *Tarski's plank problem, in the form that whenever two infinite strips together cover a compact convex set, their total width is at least as large as the width of the narrowest strip that covers the set by itself. *Whenever a line is covered by two closed subsets, then at least one of the two subsets has pairs of points at all possible distances. It also includes some topics that belong to combinatorics but are not inherently geometric, including: *Hall's marriage theorem characterizing the bipartite graphs that have a perfect matching. *Ramsey's theorem that, if the k-tuples of points from an infinite set of points are assigned finitely many colors, then an infinite subset has k-tuples of only one color. Audience and reception The book is written at a level appropriate for undergraduate students in mathematics, and assumes a background knowledge in real analysis and undergraduate-level geometry. One goal of the book is to expose students at this level to research-level problems in mathematics whose statement is readily accessible.

It was sung in pubs in the 1970s and 1980s and has since been linked with far-right organisations including the National Front and the British National Party. It was sung by Rangers F.C. supporters, many of whom have strong unionist beliefs. It may have been adopted by English fans who switched to following Scottish clubs during the five-year period that English clubs were banned from competing in European cups following the Heysel Stadium disaster. In the 21st century the song is controversial and many supporters refuse to sing it. The English Football Association emailed supporters asking them to refrain from singing it ahead of a May 2013 game against the Republic of Ireland, but it continues to be sung.  History  The \\"No Surrender\\" slogan derives from the 1689 Siege of Derry. The song is associated with unionism and particularly Northern Irish unionism. It expresses opposition to the various iterations of the Irish Republican Army, which carried out hundreds of bombings and killings targeting British security personnel and civilians, especially during the Troubles (1960s‚Äì1998). The origins of the song are unknown but it was chanted in pubs in the 1970s and 1980s and has been associated with the National Front and the British National Party. The song came to be sung by fans of Rangers F.C. some of whom have strong unionist beliefs, in contrast with the Catholic republicans of many supporters of Celtic F.C., their Old Firm rivals. The song may have been popularised among English supporters after the Heysel Stadium disaster in Brussels in 1985, which resulted in a five-year ban on English clubs competing in European competition. Some English fans chose to follow Scottish clubs instead and Rangers, one of the more successful, attracted a sizeable English following. The chant is not taken up by all supporters but has become associated with England fans in the late 20th and the 21st century, being particularly noticeable at away matches. A 2013 BBC report said that the chanting seemed to originate within sections occupied by members of the official supporter's club. The chant's popularity has lasted long after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement resolved most of the violence associated with the Troubles. The chant has also been used by the far-right English Defence League and, since the war on terror, has been modified in some cases to refer to al- Qaeda and the Taliban instead of the IRA. Other variants have referred to the eurozone crisis with \\"IRA\\" being replaced with \\"IMF\\" (International Monetary Fund), \\"EU\\" (European Union) or \\"ECB\\" (European Central Bank). While some fans consider the song controversial, sectarian and associated with the far right and refuse to sing the chant, others consider it only as an anti-terrorist statement and continue to participate. It is not a criminal offence to sing \\"No Surrender\\" but in some circumstances it could be considered by some people to contravene article three of FIFA's statutes: \\"Discrimination of any kind against a country, private person or group of people on account of ethnic origin, gender, language, religion, politics or any other reason is strictly prohibited and punishable by suspension or expulsion\\". In addition to the song some fans insert a shout of \\"no surrender\\" into the musical bridge before the line \\"send her victorious\\" in the British national anthem. The Football Association (FA) has, on a number of occasions, attempted to drown this out by increasing the volume of the music.  Recent history  In May 2013 England faced the Republic of Ireland for the first time since the February 1995 friendly which had descended into the Lansdowne Road football riot after just 27 minutes. Hoping to avoid any provocations the FA sent an email to attendees, signed by England manager Roy Hodgson asking them to refrain from singing \\"No Surrender\\". England fans accused the FA of increasing the risk of unrest by drawing attention to the song. A supporters' club spokesman said: \\"The FA have never made an issue of it in the past but they have made no attempt to explain why it's so offensive. I've never understood why some fans chant that because you don't go to England games to talk about political debate ‚Äì and a lot of the people who chant it weren't even born when the IRA carried out their bombings on mainland Britain.\\" The song was sung during that match. The issue was brought to the fore again ahead of the November 2014 match against Scotland at Celtic Park, Glasgow. Given the host ground the FA was mindful of causing unrest and again requested that the song not be sung. This time it was not, but the fans instead chanted \\"fuck the IRA\\" in time with the drums of the supporters' band for ten minutes at a time. At half time in the match an FA representative requested that the drummers stop playing. In recent years the song has continued to be sung by England supporters including at the June 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals in Portugal and during unrest in Prague 2019 associated with a UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying match.  Lyrics  The song is sung to the tune of the hymn \\"Oil in My Lamp\\" (also known as \\"Give Me Joy in My Heart\\"). > Verse: With St George in my heart, Keep me English, With St George in my > heart I pray, With St George in my heart, Keep me English, Keep me English > Till my dying day.

On various occasions, he participated in the Exposiciones Nacionales de Bellas Artes in Madrid and was a member of the (Museum Board) as well as teaching at the Escola. In 1900, he was one of the co-founders of the \\"Societat Art√≠stica i Liter√†ria de Catalunya\\". He continued to contribute to various periodicals throughout his life. His works may be seen at the MNAC, the and the Biblioteca Museu V√≠ctor Balaguer in Vilanova i la Geltr√∫, among others.

It is an extension of the notion of vertex cover in a graph. An equivalent term is a hitting set: given a collection of sets, a set which intersects all sets in the collection in at least one element is called a hitting set. The equivalence can be seen by mapping the sets in the collection onto hyperedges. Another equivalent term, used more in a combinatorial context, is transversal. The notions of hitting set and set cover are equivalent too.  Definition  Recall that a hypergraph H is a pair (V, E), where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of subsets of V called hyperedges. Each hyperedge may contain one or more vertices. A vertex-cover (aka hitting set or transversal) in H is set T ‚äÜ V such that, for all hyperedges e ‚àà E, it holds that T ‚à© e ‚â† ‚àÖ. The vertex-cover number (aka transversal number) of a hypergraph H is the smallest size of a vertex cover in H. It is often denoted by \\\\tau(H). For example, if H is this 3-uniform hypergraph: : { {1,2,3}, {1,4,5}, {4,5,6}, {2,3,6} } then H has admits several vertex-covers of size 2, for example: : {1, 6} However, no subset of size 1 hits all the hyperedges of H. Hence the vertex-cover number of H is 2. Note that we get back the case of vertex covers for simple graphs if the maximum size of the hyperedges is 2.  Algorithms  The computational problems minimum hitting set and hitting set are defined as in the case of graphs. If the maximum size of a hyperedge is restricted to d, then the problem of finding a minimum d-hitting set permits a d-approximation algorithm. Assuming the unique games conjecture, this is the best constant-factor algorithm that is possible and otherwise there is the possibility of improving the approximation to d ‚àí 1. For the hitting set problem, different parametrizations make sense. The hitting set problem is W[2]-complete for the parameter OPT, that is, it is unlikely that there is an algorithm that runs in time f(OPT)nO(1) where OPT is the cardinality of the smallest hitting set. The hitting set problem is fixed-parameter tractable for the parameter OPT + d, where d is the size of the largest edge of the hypergraph. More specifically, there is an algorithm for hitting set that runs in time dOPTnO(1).  Hitting set and set cover  The hitting set problem is equivalent to the set cover problem: An instance of set cover can be viewed as an arbitrary bipartite graph, with sets represented by vertices on the left, elements of the universe represented by vertices on the right, and edges representing the inclusion of elements in sets. The task is then to find a minimum cardinality subset of left-vertices which covers all of the right- vertices. In the hitting set problem, the objective is to cover the left- vertices using a minimum subset of the right vertices. Converting from one problem to the other is therefore achieved by interchanging the two sets of vertices.  Applications  An example of a practical application involving the hitting set problem arises in efficient dynamic detection of race condition. In this case, each time global memory is written, the current thread and set of locks held by that thread are stored. Under lockset-based detection, if later another thread writes to that location and there is not a race, it must be because it holds at least one lock in common with each of the previous writes. Thus the size of the hitting set represents the minimum lock set size to be race-free. This is useful in eliminating redundant write events, since large lock sets are considered unlikely in practice.  Fractional vertex cover  A fractional vertex-cover is a function assigning a weight to each vertex in V, such that for every hyperedge e in E, the sum of fractions of vertices in e is at least 1. A vertex cover is a special case of a fractional vertex cover in which all weights are either 0 or 1. The size of a fractional vertex-cover is the sum of fractions of all vertices. The fractional vertex-cover number of a hypergraph H is the smallest size of a fractional vertex-cover in H. It is often denoted by \\\\tau^*(H). Since a vertex-cover is a special case of a fractional vertex-cover, for every hypergraph H: > fractional-vertex-cover-number(H) ‚â§ vertex-cover-number (H); In symbols: > \\\\tau^*(H) \\\\leq \\\\tau(H). The fractional-vertex-cover-number of a hypergraph is, in general, smaller than its vertex-cover-number. A theorem of L√°szl√≥ Lov√°sz provides an upper bound on the ratio between them: * If each vertex is contained in at most d hyperedges (i.e., the degree of the hypergraph is at most d), then \\\\tau(H) / \\\\tau^*(H) \\\\leq 1 + \\\\ln(d).  Transversals in finite projective planes  A finite projective plane is a hypergraph in which every two hyperedges intersect. Every finite projective plane is r-uniform for some integer r. Denote by Hr the r-uniform projective plane. The following projective planes are known to exist: * H2: it is simply a triangle graph. * H3: it is the Fano plane. * Hp+1 exists whenever p is the power of a prime number. When Hr exists, it has the following properties: * It has r2-r+1 vertices and r2-r+1 hyperedges. * It is r-uniform - each hyperedge contains exactly r vertices. * It is r-regular - each vertex is contained in exactly r hyperedges. *\\\\tau(H_r) = r: the r vertices in each hyperedge e are a vertex-cover of Hr (since every other hyperedge intersects e). *The only transversals of size r are the hyperedges; all other transversals have size at least r+2. *\\\\tau^*(H_r) = u^*(H) = r-1+1/r. * u(H_r) = 1: every matching in Hr contains at most a single hyperedge.  Minimal transversals  A vertex-cover (transversal) T is called minimal if no proper subset of T is a transversal. The transversal hypergraph of H is the hypergraph (X, F) whose hyperedge set F consists of all minimal-transversals of H. Computing the transversal hypergraph has applications in combinatorial optimization, in game theory, and in several fields of computer science such as machine learning, indexing of databases, the satisfiability problem, data mining, and computer program optimization.

Life and career  Born in Zwickau, Heisig studied piano and composition at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Carl Maria von Weber in Dresden between 1972 and 1978. Since 1980 he has composed short aphoristic piano pieces, which form the collection Klaviert√∂ne. He also worked for the , on whose debut album he participated in 1989. Furthermore, he was involved in the composition of the film music for the feature film '. Since 1990, Heisig has been intensively engaged with the music of the composer Conlon Nancarrow, who often punched his compositions into paper rolls that were played with player pianos. Since Nancarrow was hardly interested in the duplication and distribution of these rolls, Heisig not only acquired a to interpret the works through nuanced pedalling and actuation of dynamic and tempo levers. He also had a PC-controlled punching machine built to produce and perform Nancarrow's compositions on a music roll. In the meantime, this has resulted in the world's only music roll edition of Nancarrow's works. Heisig also duplicates his own compositions with the roll technique. In his concerts he interprets Nancarrow as well as his own and other contemporary works. In 2011 he published an album with contemporary phonola music with the Musikproduktion Dabringhaus und Grimm; he also wrote a volume of poetry which was published by in 2018.

Fenton (born c. 1990) is an American Pediatrician and Adolescent Health Advocate. Fenton is an Adolescent Medicine Fellow in The Potocsnak Family Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine at Lurie Children's Hospital at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois. Fenton's clinical work is centered around providing healthcare for marginalized youth populations with a focus on cultural humility and health equity. After the police killing of George Floyd, Fenton provided medical care to protestors and has created virtual grieving spaces for Black and brown people in her medical community. As an avid writer, Fenton uses writing as a platform for advocacy to communicate topics such as public health, adolescent medicine, and diversity in medicine.  Early life and education  Fenton grew up in Sacramento, California with her sister Elisabeth Lucien, her brother Michael Lucien, and her mother and father. Fenton's parents both worked in healthcare, so from a young age, she was aware of her desire to work in healthcare and help others. Fenton attended St. Francis High School, an all-women's high school, in Sacramento, California. In high school, Fenton's sister was diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma. The experience of seeing her sister face a life-threatening disease as an adolescent inspired Fenton's future work with adolescents. In 2008, Fenton pursued her undergraduate degree at Stanford University. She majored in Human Biology and concentrated in Development from Girl to Women, a concentration she created. In 2010, Fenton joined forces with her friend, Michael Tubbs, to create a program at Stanford to help underrepresented high school students apply to college and become the first in their families to post secondary education. The non-profit they founded was called The Phoenix Scholars. Fenton became the Director of Mentor Development for the program for three years and also mentored three students directly. The program continues to exist at Stanford University, led by Stanford students, with a 100% success rate of college admission and matriculation among the students in the program. In addition to her non-profit, Fenton volunteered with the Stanford Hospital's Teen Health Van to provide healthcare services to uninsured teens. After graduating from Stanford in 2012, Fenton moved to the East Coast to attend medical school at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. In medical school, Fenton discovered that she wanted to practice adolescent medicine where she could listen to patients‚Äô stories and diagnose them in a holistic way that did not focus on just one organ system. During medical school, Fenton also found out about the return of her sister's cancer. Fenton became a bone marrow donor for her sister, which led to the successful treatment of her sister's cancer. Following her medical degree in 2016, Fenton moved back to the West Coast to pursue her residency training in Pediatrics at the Seattle Children's Hospital at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington.  Career and advocacy  In 2019, Fenton became an Adolescent Medicine Fellow in the Potocsnak Family Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine at the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois. Fenton specializes in Adolescent Medicine with a focus on treating and educating marginalized youth populations such as homeless and gender- nonconforming youth. She has conducted research on the use of hospital sponsored blogs as an platform for transgender teens and their families to seek anonymous medical advice and expertise. Fenton also continues to advocate for supporting minorities in medicine. She organizes group mentoring sessions for medical students from racially underrepresented backgrounds to help them prepare their applications for pediatric residency programs. She uses her own story as an example of the lack of confidence and support given to minority students, and then she created a supportive mentorship community to make sure that every student has a chance to excel and continue their careers in medicine.  Writing and advocacy  Fenton is an avid writer and has written for Medium since 2018 about topics in medicine, public health, and advocacy. As an advocate for health equity with a focus on providing care for marginalized youth, Fenton uses writing as a platform to educate and raise awareness of these topics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Fenton explored the racial disparities in health outcomes across patients in America. In her article, she highlighted that Black patients are often denied testing due to a lack of travel history, they are more at risk of dying due to existing chronic health conditions, and Black people make up the majority of deaths due to COVID in many states though they only make up less than 14% of the population. She advocates for improved tracking of race and ethnicity data to better understand and dissect the inequities that exist in healthcare, especially in times of crisis. In 2018, Fenton communicated the critical need to address gun violence as a public health threat. Since Fenton provided healthcare to underserved and marginalized adolescents, this gun violence disproportionately affects her patient population. Fenton walked with her students during the #MarchForOurLives in 2018. After the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, Fenton wrote about her experience providing care for Black Lives Matter protesters. Fenton also worked with her colleagues to create a grieving space for Black and brown healthcare workers and students. In addition to organizing and participating in marches alongside fellow physicians, Fenton advocates for the need for physicians and healthcare workers to acknowledge racism in their day-to-day work in order to provide the best care for their patients.

Candlelight protests is a symbolic collective gathering of political dissent in South Korea to combat injustice peacefully. This method of protesting began in 1992 for opposing the charging of online service. After that in 2002, as a result of the Yangju highway incident, was utilized in the rallies against the impeachment of Roh Moo-hyun in 2004, re-used again in the 2008 U.S. beef protests, and emerged in the 2016-18 President Park Geun-hye protests.  1990's = Opposing the charging of online service  September 26 1992, It was the first candlelight rally in South Korea in 1992 when online users gathered to oppose the charging of the online service of Kotel. Until then, KETEL, a large PC communication network owned by the Korea Economic Daily, provided the service for free of charge. However, with the acquisition of Ketel by Korea PC Telecom, the company will announce the payment on February 18, 1992. Although PC communication service providers did not oppose charging, they opposed charging method. 100% of the charges and prepayment of credit cards were the same as asking Ketel users, who were mostly students at the time, to leave Ketel and close the club. In response, some 60 club acquaintances in Ketel gather to form a standing committee and propose opposition to advance payment, payment of land, student discounts and postponement of the deadline. However, when Korea's PC news agency unilaterally implemented the policy, the club's acquaintances fight back by shutting down the club's bulletin board. Also, Hitel users resisted by holding a candlelight vigil in front of the Korea PC Telecom building from Feb. 24. Of course, such protests do not translate paid services free of charge, but it is meaningful that it is the first event to show that online users can influence the real world by showing that netizens can protest against corporate unilateral policies. Afterwards, after forming the \\"club council,\\" the opinions of the correspondents were reflected in various negotiations for three months through negotiations with the Korea PC News Agency, and the paid- in under the name of \\"Kotel\\" will begin on May 1. After the first candlelight rally, netizens began to influence society by going beyond online and offline on important issues through PC communications and the Internet.  2000's = The Yangju highway incident  Background A large candlelight rally was held in Gwanghwamun, Seoul, in memory of female students who were run over and killed by a U.S. armored vehicle in 2002. It was kind of U.S. Army's Assassination of a Korean Female Middle School Student. At that time, this candlelight vigil was initiated by a user with the ID \\"Angma\\" on the bulletin board of Ohmy News on November 28, 2002. The rally later turned into an anti- American rally when the assailant, the U.S. military, was found not guilty. Demonstrations On November 20, 2002, the U.S. military court made its first verdict of not guilty for the soldiers involved in the incident, triggering the re-emergence of the girls' crushed bodies being spread online after initially taking them down to respect their deaths. News of this incident and the trial's outcome was circulated through a TV documentary, which amassed an online community that viewed this incident as a \\"National Tragedy\\", resulting in nationwide candlelight vigils being held at the suggestion of a netizen in an internet cafe to collectively mourn the death of the girls. On November 30, about 30,000 Koreans gathered in Gwanghwamun for the first mass candlelight vigil to commemorate the girls and protest their injustice death as people sang the national anthem and voiced their demands. The mishandling of this case by the U.S. and the Korean government mobilized the vigils to gain momentum as they began to be held every weekend from November 2002 up until late January 2003. Following the protests, on November 27 President Bush issued a statement of apology through an American ambassador, but it was met with discontent from netizens as they sought for a direct apology from Bush and for the soldiers involved in the incident to be held accountable for their crimes. Following these events, the protesters had three demands they attempted to achieve, which outlined the following: (1) that the jurisdiction of the case be handed over to the South Korean court, (2) That an amendment should be made onto The Status of Forces Agreement to eliminate the autonomy U.S. servicemen have in evading the South Korean government and punishment, and (3) that President Bush, issue a statement of apology for death of the middle school girls. The vigils that continued to take place were labeled by some Korean media sources as \\"anti-Americanist\\" while others viewed it as a platform for self-expression for the younger generation. On December 7, the netizens who were participating in one of the 43 city-wide candlelight protests in Gwanghwamun broke through the police blockade and made their way to the U.S. embassy where they persistently tried to persuade them to apologize and seek appropriate justice. The last mass vigil took place on December 14, with about 100,000 people from over 60 cities and 15 countries gathering at Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul. Revisions were made to The Status of Forces Agreement as a result of these demonstrations. Since the incident, candlelight vigils have become a staple protest culture in South Korea.  A protest against the Roh Moo-hyun president's impeachment  BackgroundRoh and Bush meet in October 2003 On a national televised news conference in 2004, President Roh displayed no remorse over his brother's bribe scandal and instead, blamed the construction company executive involved for exploiting a \\"lesser educated man\\". The following day, Roh also expressed his support for the Uri party and refused to publicly apologize, defiantly going against the parliament's demand for one, which caused the last traces of parliament support for Roh to cease. On March 12, members of the conservative oppositional party impeached Roh on the grounds of him violating \\"political neutrality\\" when he asked the nation to support the newly established Uri party for the April 15 elections. The National Assembly stripped Roh from his role as the head of state and chief commander soon after the voting session had ended, with Prime Minister Goh Kun stepping up as the interim President of South Korea. Despite Prime Minister Goh's assurance to the public that he would maintain Roh's policies with North Korea and the United States as well as protect South Korea's economy from going into chaos, Roh's supporters met the news of impeachment with hostility, rage, and as an embarrassment to their country due to Roh being the first democratically elected leader to be impeached. Demonstrations Roh Moo-hyun was president who wanted to fight authoritarianism and regionalism is president. His capital relocation plan and the announcement of a grand coalition have been altered and criticized, and his stagnant economic growth has also led to the worst approval rating ever for a president of 5 percent. And he became the first president to be impeached in the history of the Republic of Korea's constitutional history for violating the election law, which calls for his support of the Uri Party. But the anger is not people, Roh Moo-hyun. Many citizens gathered at the National Assembly and poured into the streets shouting \\"impeachment\\" for the impeached president, holding candles. Candles filled the streets of Gwanghwamun in Seoul to Daehanmun Gate in Deoksugung Palace, and such rallies continued throughout the country until the Constitutional Court rejected the impeachment motion.  A gang rape of a middle school girl in Miryang  In 2004, a rape case occurred in Miryang, Gyeongsangnam-do. Forty-four high school students in Miryang lured a victim from Ulsan to an online chat and raped her for a year. Candlelight rally to protest the Miryang Girls' Middle School incident A candlelight rally was also voluntarily gathered by the internet masses who were angry at the incident. On the 11th, at 7 pm, in front of Kyobo Book Center in Jongno-gu, Seoul, and Lotte Department Store in Seomyeon, Busan, voices condemned the victims of the ‚ÄúMild Middle School Girls Sexual Assault‚Äù case and the police's insufficient investigation. Beginning on the 10th, internet users proposed to hold a candlelight protest under the motto of urging the police for thorough investigation and investigation, strengthening punishment for sexual assaults, and improving the social atmosphere that treats victims of sexual assault. Accordingly, the people gathered at the candlelight protests voluntarily held free speech and picket protests. They were known as voluntary gatherers through Internet communities such as DC Inside and Funny University.(a name of web communities)  Opposition to U.S. Beef Imports  BackgroundAgainst US beef agreement Candlelight vigils protesting U.S. beef imports were different from before. A group of teenage girls, named Candlelight Girl, gathered in Cheonggye Plaza on May 2, 2008 to hold candles on the outcome of the negotiations, which included more than 30 months of beef imports and a ban on imports of mad cow disease in the United States. The protests, sparked by middle and high school students, who were not college students, spread across the country for more than 100 days, with a million couples participating, including food-conscious housewives. Spontaneous demonstrations spread widely through the Internet and cell phone finally made Lee Myung-bak drew the president of the apology. The rally was called the Candlelight Cultural Festival, which was held in the form of a cultural festival in order to avoid violating the provisions of the Act on Assembly and Demonstration, which prohibits outdoor rallies or demonstrations after sunset. The biggest feature is that unlike before, voluntary individuals without the so-called \\"leading forces,\\" or middle and high school students, and college students, office workers, and strollers, participated in the event to express their opinions nonviolently. DemonstrationsA candlelight vigil being held in Busan against the importation of U.S. beef On May 2, 2008, the streets of Seoul were filled with hundreds of secondary and college students that orchestrated a candlelight vigil via text messages and the internet in protest of the agreement. Thereafter, the candlelight protests became a daily occurrence, with 100,000 people gathering to rally against the agreement and calling for the impeachment of President Lee, which had garnered 1.2 million signatures online on May 6. On May 22, the Korean government announced that they would attempt to exclude certain parts of U.S. beef that may be more receptive to mad cow disease as the President offered an apology for disregarding the public's health concerns, but this did not quell their grievances. Protests erupted in Busan, Chuncheon, Daegu, and Gwangju, with the end of May ushering 211 arrests on protestors for displaying political slogans and signs that the Korean government had warned against utilizing. During the third week of June, President Lee's cabinet stepped down from their position due to the enormous amount of pressure they received from the protestors. On June 25, another agreement was discussed wherein President Lee lifted the ban on U.S. beef from cattle that were less than 30 months old. In response, a protest was organized by the People's Association Against Mad Cow Disease, leading to 91 arrests. Other protesters attempted to make their way to the president's office but were detained by police. On June 30, a wave of a new march was headed by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) with hundreds of its members coming out to protest. The candlelight protests lasted from May 2008 until August 2008 and is remembered as a mass movement that emerged from the South Korean government's failure to hold the trust of the people.  2010's  Operation to rescue Ferry Sewol  Sinking of MV Sewol On April 16, 2014, 304 out of 476 passengers (about 250 students from Danwon High School) were killed or missing when the Incheon-Jeju Port regular passenger ship Ferry Sewol operated by Cheonghae Shipping Co. capsized and sank in waters near Gwanmae Island, Jindo-gun, Jeollanam-do. On May 31, rallies and marches were held in Seoul and other major cities, including Ansan and Busan, to pay tribute to the victims of the Ferry Sewol accident and to urge them to find out the truth. The \\"People's Countermeasure Meeting for the Ferry Sewol Disaster,\\" consisting of 800 civic groups, held a candlelight vigil in memory of Ferry Sewol at 6 p.m. at Cheonggye Plaza in Seoul, with 20,000 people gathered. The candlelight vigils continued until the 23rd session until 2017.  Request for Park Geun-hye president's impeachment  Background In September 2016, the so-called 'Park Geun-hye Choi Soon-sil Gate', which was alleged that President Park Geun-hye's secretary Choi Soon- sil intervened in the national administration, demanded the investigation of the truth about the government's farms and the resignation of President Park Geun-hye on October 29 of the same year. A candlelight rally was held. On November 12, the '2016 People's Citizens' Convention' hosted by the 'Park Geun-hye regime retirement emergency action', which was held by over 1500 civil society organizations, opened in Seoul's Gwanghwamun area, the largest of its kind, one million people (estimated by the organizers, police) The estimate was 260,000). On November 26, 1.9 million people (330,000 police officers) from all over the country participated to record the largest demonstration in the Korean constitutional history. On December 3, the prosecution of President Park Geun-hye was proposed and passed on December 9 As a result, the presidency was suspended. However, the candlelight rally demanding President Park Geun-hye's resignation continued until the following year, and the cumulative number of participants exceeded 15 million from the 9th of March to the 20th candlelight rally. And on March 10, the Constitutional Court's impeachment trial unanimously cited the impeachment prosecution, so President Park Geun-hye was dismissed from the presidency and became the first president of the constitution to be retired from impeachment during his tenure. The candlelight vigil attracted the attention of the world by awakening a large number of violent citizens to conduct peaceful protests without violence, judging and driving unfair power without shedding blood. Demonstrations Main articles: Impeachment of Park Geun-hye and 2016‚Äì17 South Korean protests Candlelight Protest around Sejong Center at Gwanghwamun The candlelight protests initially started in October 2016 and lasted until March 2017. The first candlelight vigil was held on October 29, shortly after the corruption scandal was disseminated through the media. The protests that were held came to be known as the Candlelight Revolution and amassed over 2 million protestors in Gwanghwamun Square in early December. The Candlelight Revolution pressured the National Assembly into processing the impeachment of Park, with the Constitutional Court approving the motion on March 11, 2017 as the rallies continued throughout the months with fervor. On February 13, 2018, Choi was sentenced to 20 years in prison for corruption and on April 6 of the same year, Park was found guilty of corruption, coercion, abuse of power, and leaking classified information, which amounted to her final sentence being a total of 24 years in prison.  Support the reform of the prosecution  September-October 2019, Prosecution Reform Candlelight Culture Festival, which was initiated by the National Citizens' Solidarity for Judicial Abolition, began on September 16, and until September 20 (1st ~ 5th) in front of the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, September 21st (6th) rally, 6th, 7th, moved the location to the Seocho-dong Supreme Prosecutors' Office. On the 28th of September, the rally was filled with citizens about 600m from the silkworm bridge at the prosecutor's office to the intersection of Seocho Station. October 5th (8th) 8th, October 12th (9th) 9th, Seoul Seocho-dong Seocho Station Intersection, Seoul Arts Center direction, Gyodae Station direction, Prosecutor's Office direction (Main Stage), Surreypool Tunnel direction Screens were installed in four directions. At the 8th and 9th rallies, in the direction of Seoul Arts Center (about 1km), Gyodae Station (about 500m), Surrey Full Tunnel (about 300m), and Prosecutors' Office (about 600m), about 2.4km in length, Seocho-daero and Banpo-daero Citizens are full. Citizens who participated in the cultural festival shouted for protection of the country, prosecution reform, establishment of airborne offices, and media reform. From October 19 to December 14, 2019, the Candlelight Culture Festival of the Prosecution Reform moved from Seocho-dong to Yeouido after the resignation of the former Minister of Justice of the Fatherland. On October 19th (10th), 10th, screens were installed in the direction of Sogang Bridge and Yeouido Station (main stage). Participating citizens shouted for prosecution reform and establishment of airborne offices. From this time, through December 14th (15th), they went through the Republic of Korea Parliament House and marched to the Liberal Party. On October 26th (11th), the 11th moved to Yeouido-daero (near Yeouido Park), and a request for special prosecutorial documents was issued along with requests for the establishment of a prosecutor's reform airlift. The same was done on the 2nd of November 2nd (12th). Then, after resting for about 4 weeks, on the 30th of November 30th (13th), they held a rally under the title of the Prosecution Reform National Assembly. The location has changed slightly. And on the 7th of December (the 14th), the 14th political prosecutor dismantled and a picket called fast track investigation also appeared. The seat was moved to the 11th and 12th locations. On December 15th (15th), the 15th moved to the 10th venue and held the last rally. It was only an act of citizens who gathered opinions by holding candles, but without much progress or remuneration, many people participated in the rally. It was an ambassador with a historical significance in the world in that it made the move, prosecuted the impeachment of the president, dismissed after approval, and even elected a new president.

Palimpsest marks the band's first studio record since 2013's Volition, and their first new material since 2016's Pacific Myth EP. This is the first studio album (and second overall release) of the band to feature session member Cam McLellan on bass and full-time member Mike Ieradi on drums. Background Talking about the recording process of Palimpsest, Guitarist Luke Hoskin explained, \\"'Palimpsest' is by far the most challenging record we have worked on. The writing and recording process saw so many delays, it's honestly hard to keep them straight. We are very proud of how each hurdle was handled though, and the end result is a record that we believe is deserving of such an endeavor.\\" Vocalist Rody Walker stated, \\"This record was extremely difficult for me personally. With my first child on the way, I built a studio in my basement to ensure I wasn't leaving my wife alone with a new child for weeks on end. I haven't left my house since.\\" He blew his voice during touring in 2018 which caused him to take a break for a year to recover. Recording was completed in November 2019. Concept Walker described the concept of the album in an interview with Loudwire, \\"Well, it was being written like three years ago. Trump had just taken office and all this stuff was happening; all the MAGA hats were out in full force and all sorts of stuff like that. And I started thinking about the definition of greatness. And I have a feeling people are going to view this as though it's talking negatively about the United States, and that is not entirely it, because the greatness that Donald Trump and all his cronies want to return to is only great for the old, white, male, rich elite\\". \\"That is the greatness of America that the rest of the world views as its tragic flaw. And I wanted to discuss that aspect of things, but I also wanted to discuss the greatness that we actually view as America's greatness. Because there is greatness, there's beauty, there's all sorts of stuff. There's innovation, there‚Äôs an incredible history. And I wanted to discuss both the negative and the positive and identify what I personally find the greatness to be.\\" This album uses various lyrical subjects including Amelia Earhart, Florence Owens Thompson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the Hindenburg disaster, the Lakota, and the Great Depression. Critical reception At Sputnikmusic, Channing Freeman stated, \\"Though the title of Palimpsest is intended to describe the way Americans rewrite their history in favorable ways, it can be applied to the history of Protest the Hero as well. They have consistently reinvented themselves from seemingly blank slates on which the past is faintly visible. The breakneck leads and spastic riffing of Kezia and Fortress have been refined and molded to better suit an older, wiser band. Whatever comes next, traces of Palimpsest will hopefully remain.\\" Reviewer Andy Synn of No Clean Singing said in an unrated review, \\"In simple terms, Palimpsest is the sound of a band renewed and reinvigorated, combining the epic vibe of Fortress (still, for many, the band's magnum opus), with the more lithe and limber, shoot-for-the-moon, approach of their debut album, Kezia\\". Synn concluded, \\"That being said, don't go thinking that this new record is simply a throwback to the group's early years (both musically and thematically nothing could be further from the truth), as it definitely incorporates all the lessons which they learned making Scurrilous and Volition too, as well as some unexpected new tricks and twists.\\" Track listingPersonnel=Band members *Rody Walker ‚Äî vocals *Luke Hoskin ‚Äî guitar *Tim Millar ‚Äî guitar, piano *Mike Ieradi ‚Äî drums *Cam McLellan ‚Äî bass Other personnel *Derya Nagle ‚Äî production *Milen Petzelt-Sorace ‚Äî production, orchestral arrangement *Todd Kowalski ‚Äî bass on track 2 *Anthony Kalabretta ‚Äî vocal production, engineering *Dean Hadjichristou ‚Äî drum production, engineering, editing *Darren ‚ÄúJeter‚Äù Magierowski ‚Äî additional engineering, editing *Jill Zimmermann ‚Äî additional engineering, editing *Simon Grove ‚Äî assistant engineering, mixing *Ermin Hamidovic ‚Äî mastering *Martin Wittfooth ‚Äî album artwork References Category:2020 albums Category:Protest the Hero albums ","title":"Palimpsest (album)"},{"id":"64318407","text":"Wen Chean Lim (born 30 July 1988) is a Malaysian rhythmic gymnast.

Biography  Gemma Donati's life is relatively undocumented. Throughout his life, Dante never mentioned Donati, instead he wrote prolifically about his love-interest and muse Beatrice Portinari, whom he met when he was nine. Donati was born to Manetto and Maria Donati in around 1267, two years after her future husband, Dante Alighieri. The Donati family was a wealthy family in medieval Florence. She was betrothed to Dante in 1277 when he was either 11 or 12 years old. Her dowry was only 200 florins, which suggests that Dante's family had no substantial assets by the mid-1270s. Nevertheless, an alliance with the Donati family through marriage was socially prestigious. Since the Donati family owned a lot of land in Florence and made money through renting, it is very likely that the Donatis were the landlords of the Alighieri home. The couple were married sometime around 1285 while they were in their early 20s. Accounts vary as to how many children and Donati and Dante had, but they had at least four children: * Pietro (c. 1286) * Giovanni (c. 1288) * Jacapo (c. 1300) * Antonia (c. 1300) There has been discussion among scholars of whether or not the marriage between Donati and Dante was a happy one. In Boccaccio's Trattatello in laude di Dante, Boccaccio writes that Dante's relationship with Donati only brought him trouble and pain. Despite this claim, there is no firm evidence that the marriage wasn't a happy one. There is evidence that Dante was on good terms with Donati's family, as in the 1290s Manetto Donati gave Dante several loans.

She is the founder and chair of Association of War Affected Women and Parents of Servicemen Missing in Action.  Education  Dharmadasa holds a degree in negotiations and mediation skills from the United States Institute for Peace, Washington, and in women and security from Harvard University and Cambridge, USA.  Activism  During Sri Lanka's civil war ,Visaka's sons joined the military. To stop war and prevent death of her sons, Visaka started the Kandy- based Association for War Affected Families. This association spreads information about \\"how we have to do something to stop the war ripping our country apart\\". On September 27, 1998 the LTTE attacked the Sri Lankan military base in Kilinochchi. Her son Achintha Senarath went missing as well as 608 other soldiers. After the attack Association of Parents of Servicemen Missing in Action (PSMIA) was found by Dharmadasa. The members of PSMIA are dedicated to uncovering the fate of soldiers missing in action, advocating for the release of detainees, and promoting peace in Sri Lanka. The Association helped solve several issues, including the issue of identification tags to all soldiers and the expedited registration and tracing process of the International Committee of the Red Cross. As the PSMIA advocated for change within the Sri Lankan military, Dharmadasa took her passion for peace directly to the Tamil rebels. Dharmadasa believes that contact and communication are essential in the peacebuilding process between the rebels and the government. She initiated talks between opposing sides in the conflict and designed the Track II dialogue process that helped broker a ceasefire and ultimate end to the civil war. The PSMIA established the Association of War Affected Women. It and the Parents of Servicemen Missing in Action continue to work for peace. They bring communities together, provide conflict resolution trainings for women, and assist those affected by the 2004 tsunami. In 2009 Association of War Affected Women initiated a campaign to make the promise of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 a reality. As Dharmadasa says, \\"You can't just say, 'Include women, include women.' You have to show the capacities of women.\\" With this in mind, AWAW prepare women to campaign for government office and become effective leaders. So far, they have trained 500 women and have begun workshops with 750 more women from across Sri Lanka. She is also the gender focal point for GPPAC in Sri Lanka, as well as Director of the board of National Peace Council and PAFFREL of Sri Lanka.  Awards  Dharmadasa was awarded the Humanitarian award for 2006 by the Inter-Action of Washington DC. Inter-Action is an NGO consortium comprising 160 non governmental organisations. In coordination with the ‚Äú1000 Peace women across the globe‚Äù movement, she was nominated for a collective Nobel Peace Prize in 2005.  Personal life  Dharmadasa lives in Kandy. She is a Buddhist. She is married to an Indian. She has two other sons apart from the one missing in action, one of whom still serves with the army.

A member of the African National Congress, she served as the Member of the Executive Council (MEC) for Cooperative Governance, Traditional Affairs and Human Settlements from February 2012 to August 2016. Early life and career Mlamleli was born in 1957 in Viljoenskroon in the Orange Free State Province. She studied at the Mphohadi College where she obtained a teaching degree in 1976. She proceeded to work as a teacher and was later appointed a school principal. She obtained a Bachelor of Arts, a Bachelors in Education and a master's degree in education focusing on the education models of the United States and Japan. In 1996, she was employed as a manager in the Free State Department of Education. She was selected as a director in the Office on the Status of Women in 2001. Premier Beatrice Marshoff appointed her as a coordinator of the Municipal Infrastructure Grants. Political career Mlamleli was elected a Member of the Free State Provincial Legislature in 2009. The legislature designated her as the chairperson of the corporate governance, traditional affairs and human settlements portfolio committee. In 2012, premier Ace Magashule appointed her as the MEC for that specific portfolio, succeeding Mamiki Qabathe. She remained in the position following the 2014 general election. Mlamleli has served as the African National Congress Women's League provincial chairperson. She is described as someone who is aligned to ANC secretary-general and former premier Magashule. Mayoralty Mlamleli was selected as the ANC's mayoral candidate for the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality. The ANC retained their majority in council in the August 2016 municipal election. Consequently, she was elected mayor when the council reconvened on 18 August. She became the city's first female mayor. An inauguration ceremony was held for her in September. Mlamleli was appointed SALGA provincial chairperson in November 2016. During her mayoralty, the rating agency Moody's downgraded the municipality to B3 in August 2019, citing that the municipality's service delivery could collapse if there was no immediate intervention. It was downgraded again to Caa1 in January 2020 over concerns of poor liquidity. The regional ANC called for removal, yet the provincial structure defended her. The provincial government placed the municipality under administration in December 2019. Mlamleli had survived two motions of no-confidence. On 7 August 2020, a third one was held, wherein opposition parties claimed that she had been removed. The result was initially delayed due to a lack of quorum. The speaker Mxolisi Ashford announced on 14 August that 31 councillors voted for the motion, 28 against, while 9 spoilt their ballots, effectively removing Mlamleli as mayor. Lebohang Masoetsa is now the acting mayor until the council meets to elect new leadership.

Biography  Olivero is the youngest of nine brothers. He was born in Pandola, a village in the Province of Salerno, where his family moved for work. His father was originally from Boves (CN) and his mother from Avellino. He went to school first in Campania and then in Chieri, where he moved when he was 12 years old. He workerd in some factories in area and later in a branch of San Paolo bank, until he decided to resign and to dedicate his life to fighting poverty.  Sermig  On his 24th birthday, on 24 May 1964, he founded Sermig (Servizio Missionario Giovani) together with his wife Maria Cerrato, whom he had met organizing the ‚ÄúGiornate Mossionarie Mondiali‚Äù, and with some friends that he was meeting weekly at home. This group, gathering young people, couples, monks and nuns, began to take care of poor and marginalized people in Turin following the Gospel teachings. The goal of the organisation is to eliminate hunger and big injustices in the world, to build peace, to help young people to find an ideal in life, raise public awareness about the problems of the poor in the third world.E. Olivero, Dio non guarda l'orologio, pag. 31 e seguenti. Very soon the number of people engaged in the project increased. The seat of the group at the beginning was in the office of ‚ÄúPontificie Opere Missionarie‚Äù and then, starting from 1969, in the church of Arcivescovado street. The first years of the group overlapped with the protests of 1968. Even though the cultural climate pushed many Catholics at the time to support Gospel with Marx‚Äôs writings, Sermig volunteers wanted to position themselves as ‚Äúsimple Christians‚Äù without any political affiliation. In that period, the group raised founds and organized exhibitions, markets and benefit concerts with Nomadi, Al Bano and Romina Power, Adriano Celentano and others, with sometimes a big public response. In particular, on February 23, 1969, Olivero and the other Sermig activists managed to fill the urin for a concert by Celentaro, when, at that time, Celentano never had had a bigger audience than 3.000.SermigErnesto Olivero, Dio non guarda l'orologio  Peace Arsenal  Entrance to the Peace Arsenal On 2 August 1983 Olivero took over the management, after years of requests to the municipality of Turin, of a part of the structures of the old military arsenal located in the district of Borgo Dora, one of the infamous neighborhoods in town. Sermig together with the help of thousands of young volunteers coming from all over Italy restored completely the building, which then was in a bad state. The building was turned into \\"Peace Arsenal\\" (\\"Arsenale della Pace\\"), a structure extended over about 40.000 m¬≤.Gianmario Ricciardi, Ernesto Olivero, il personaggio e la profezia, SEI 1996. From that time, the Arsenal defined itself as a ‚Äúmetropolitan monastery‚Äú and gave assistance to immigrants, drug addicts, alcoholics, AIDS patients and homeless. In the 1990s, young people of the Arsenal started the movement Giovani della Pace. In 1996, Olivero opened Arsenal of Hope in S√£o Paulo in Brazil and in 2003, Arsenal of Meeting in Madaba in Jordan. In 2006, Olivero and his fellows took over four kids for social care, who were famous for bullying a handicapped person.SuperAbile, Scuola, da bulli a bravi ragazzi: ‚ÄúQuei quattro giovani sono cambiati‚Äù  Activities  Many people (prisoners, young people in difficulty, abandoned mothers, and others) were reintegrated into society thanks to Ernesto Olivero and his movement: among them also some famous ex-prisoners and former prisoners who had life sentences, such as the crime boss Pietro Cavallero, personally known by Olivero in the 1970s.Messaggero di sant'Antonio - Dicembre 1999 - Ges√π accoglie chi ha peccato e lo abilita alla comunione fraterna. A mensa con i peccatori Meetings like these made him come up with the idea to implement, first in Italy, a cooperative between prisoners and free people during the Years of Lead. Due to his reputation as a mediator and neutral person, he could also be, for example, one of the few civilians allowed into Lebanon for a peace mission in 1988 after many years in civil war. He was sent there by the Maronite patriarch Nasrallah Pierre Sfeir.http://www.giovanipace.org/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=984&Itemid;=26 He was also officially appointed a mediator by the Minister of Justice Giuliano Vassalli during the revolt in the prison of Porto Azzurro, on Elba island, in 1987.

I suoi incontri con questi personaggi, a volte rocamboleschi, sono raccontati da Olivero, nell'autobiografia Dio non guarda l'orologio. Among many young people who dedicate their life to the cause of his organisations, several opt for celibacy and choose the Arsenal as their home. This is why the Arsenal is recognized as an Institute of consecrated life by the Archdiocese of Turin. Starting from 1976 Olivero published several books.

Plot  The story starts in the nineteenth century in Bengal Presidency. Bulbbul is married off to Indranil, the Bado Thakur (Elder Lord), when she is barely five years old. She is close with Satya, Indranil's youngest brother, who is closer to her age. Bulbbul and Satya grow up together, playing and telling each other stories of a demon woman (\\"chudail\\"). Indranil's mentally challenged twin brother Mahender shows a strange appeal toward Bulbbul. Twenty years later, Satya returns home from London. In that time, Mahender was killed in what is believed to be a chudail's attack. His widow Binodini now lives in an outhouse. Indranil has left the village and Bulbbul has taken over his responsibilities. The village doctor, Sudip, regularly visits to check Bulbbul's feet. Their closeness causes jealousy in Satya. While on a hunt, a man is killed, which is attributed to the chudail. Satya, however, suspects Sudip. In flashbacks, it is revealed that Binodini had been jealous of Indranil and Bulbbul‚Äôs marriage, and hinted to Indranil that Bulbbul had feelings for Satya. In response, Indranil sent Satya to London to separate the two. Bulbbul and Satya had been working on a story together, the manuscript of which Satya handed over to her before leaving for London. Heartbroken, she had thrown the manuscript into the fireplace. With his mind poisoned by Binodini, Indranil takes out the remaining burning pages and reads them, becoming convinced of Bulbbul's feelings for Satya. Enraged, he beats and mutilates her feet. While she is bedridden, Mahender rapes her and apparently causes her death. However, the event actually causes a supernatural change in Bulbbul ‚Äî she comes back with a mission to help the females in the village fight back against injustice. She goes through a symbolic transformation that is defined by a blood red moon, which indicates that the goddess Kali has given her soul a chance to return to her mortal body. She starts punishing the men who abuse and murder their wives or take advantage of girls by killing them but the villagers think it is a chudail, distinguished by her backward feet. Satya escorts Sudip to Calcutta on the charge of being the murderer. On the way, the driver of the carriage is killed by the chudail, making Satya realize Sudip is innocent. He shoots the chudail, mortally wounding her. During a brawl with Sudip, he unintentionally sets the forest on fire. Soon he realises that Bulbbul is the chudail when Sudip shouts for her. Upon realizing this, Satya cries in agony, while Bulbbul (who had taken refuge from the fire in a tree) watches him and is shown to be slowly engulfed by the flames. A year later, Indranil returns to an empty house as Satya has departed, as Satya had felt he, too, was becoming like his brothers. One night, Indranil is awoken from his sleep by Bulbbul, who presumably kills Indranil to take revenge.  Cast  * Tripti Dimri as Bulbbul * Avinash Tiwary as Satya * Paoli Dam as Binodini * Rahul Bose as Indranil and Mahendra * Parambrata Chattopadhyay as Dr. Sudip Production The story was written by Anvita Dutt, who has been a commissioned writer for films. She wrote the first two pages of the story after awaking from her sleep one night and outlined the chudail and the myth and idea behind her in this first draft. She completed the rest of the story after returning from a trip from Kolkata, after seeing a bulbul make a nest outside her house and after some encouragement from her colleagues. She intended the story to resemble a fairy tale and set it in the neoclassical era of Bengal to fulfill that. She was also inspired by Rabindranath Tagore's portrayal of women; Binodini is the name of one of the characters in his work. The premise has similarites with Tagore's novella Nastanirh, which was adapted by Satyajit Ray as the 1964 film Charulata. Dutt describes, \\"Now in reality what happens to women is much worse. The emotional, the physical and the psychological abuse is much, much worse. In telling of the story, I chose to tell it this way. I wanted the cold rage of women to find an outlet... It's a tragedy. The story is set 200 years ago but it's still relevant.\\" The film was shot over a period of thirty-three days in locations near Kolkata and Mumbai. Siddharth Diwan led the cinematography. With inputs from Dutt, the artwork of Raja Ravi Varma and Caravaggio were used as inspiration, in addition to influences from Expressionism and Surrealism. Diwan also took inspiration from photographers like Man Ray and Raja Deen Dayal. Satyajit Ray's poster of the film Devi was an inspiration for the lighting. Some examples of symbolism used include the grass, kaash phool, the bird and flower motifs, all significant to the goddess Durga. The mansion used in the film is Bawali Rajbari, located from Kolkata in the village of Nodakhali. The mansion has previously featured in the film Chokher Bali by Rituparno Ghosh. Themes Set in the late 19th century in Bengal, the film delves into the idea of aristocratic Bengali women embracing Western ideologies of freedom. Aruna Chakravarti's Jorasanko described Tagore's relationship with his child-bride sister-in-law, Kadambari, which Shreya Paul of Firstpost noted as the foundation behind the relationship between Bulbbul and Satya. Chakravarti described how Kadambari was devastated when she was separated from Tagore (due to his marriage). Further, Tagore's older brother, Birendranath, suffered from a mental illness but was still married off and abused his wife, similar to Binodini being married off to Mahender. Aditya Mani Jha of Firstpost noted that the film is \\"a postmodern example of the Gothic genre\\", the most common example of which is Bram Stoker's Dracula. Satya is similar to Jonathan Harker, the protagonist of Dracula, in that they have the same \\"cold, unemotional logic\\" that leads them to investigate the case (much like Sherlock Holmes) and eventually decide to kill the monster themselves. The supernatural element (chudail in this case) embodying repressed emotions or desires is a trope of the Gothic genre. Bulbbul's reveal as the chudail frames her like a goddess, specifically like Kali. Binodini subtly planting the idea of Bulbbul and Satya in Indranil's head makes her like Iago.  Reception  Bulbbul opened up to generally positive reception from the critics and the audience with a particular praise for its stand on feminism, visual effects, background music, and performance of the leads, especially Tripti Dimri. However, it was criticized for short length and predictable plot. Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express stated: \\"Bulbbul is very much its own film, the mix of classic pre-Renaissance Bengal and desi horror gothic making for gripping viewing... It is a powerfully feminist, revisionist tale of a woman wronged, and it is told with economy, precision and feeling...Dutt uses the ancient trope of a bloodthirsty 'chudail with ultey pair', a familiar creature tale in our scary 'kisse-kahaani', to create dread and fear. The writing is skilful and stays on point, and the performances are all solid.\\" Namrata Joshi of The Hindu applauded the rebellious idea of Dutt and stated: \\"Anvita Dutt mixes the feudal with the supernatural, the spooky, the mythological and the fablesque in a thoughtful, moving and engaging manner....She mixes the feudal with the supernatural and the spooky, the mythological and the fablesque to strike at the putrid core of patriarchy in a thoughtful, moving, engaging and powerful manner.\\" Shubhram Kulkarni of Koimoi gave it 3.5 stars and stated \\"As much as I am in love with Anvita Dutt as the writer, her direction is point one below. As observed, while the script tries to keep the big reveal hidden, the direction and dialogue make it predictable. Thus making the climax less hitting.\\" Stutee Ghosh of The Quint gave it 3 stars and mentioned \\"One of the questions that the film throws up and doesn't answer is if the binary between being a devi or a chudail is the only recourse that feminine power has to navigate in this patriarchal set up.\\" Kritika Vaid of India.com mentioned the universally positive reaction of the audience in social media. Veteran Director Anurag Kashyap tweeted and called the film one of the best he had seen in this millennium and also praised the performance by the lead actors and Anvita Dutt. Sameer Sulunkhe of Cineblitz rated it as 2.5 stars and observed \\"The film is a celebration of colors ‚Äì red hues symbolizing anger, celebration, menstruation and above all womanhood, stark blue representing the grim past. Adding to this visual spectacle is Amit Trivedi‚Äôs hauntingly beautiful score, dominated by violin. It‚Äôs a great combination of audio-visual storytelling. What hurts Bulbbul is its writing. Writer-director Anvita Dutt has tremendous command over the language, and the dialogues have a literary touch (no surprise as it is set in Tagore‚Äôs Bengal), but the overall narrative lacks novelty and doesn‚Äôt have much impact either. \\"  References  External links  * Category:2020 films Category:Hindi-language Netflix original films Category:Indian direct-to-video films Category:Hindi-language horror films Category:Films set in West Bengal Category:Films set in 1881 Category:Films set in 1901 Category:Indian films Category:2020 direct-to-video films Category:Indian supernatural thriller films Category:Indian ghost films ","title":"Bulbbul"},{"id":"64319118","text":"The Maiden and the Nightingale (Spanish: Quejas, o la Maja y el Ruise√±or) is a piano piece by the Spanish composer Enrique Granados. The piece, which lasts about six minutes, is part of his suite Goyescas which was inspired by the work of the painter Goya. While the girls known as majas are a frequent subject of Goya, the piece has not been associated with a particular painting. The piece starts with the queja (in English, plaint or sad cry) of the maiden. Near the end there are glittering bird-like trills representing the nightingale. Discography The composer recorded the piece on piano roll. Other 20th-century pianists who played the work included: *Arthur Rubinstein: an example of a pianist who programmed The maiden and the nightingale as a self-standing piece, Rubinstein's recordings available on CD include various versions, for example one from 1930. *Alicia de Larrocha: noted for her performances of Goyescas, Larrocha was a winner at the 34th Annual Grammy Awards with one of her recordings of the suite. An earlier recording is also available. Related works=Goyescas (opera) In 1915 Granados adapted the music to form a soprano aria for the third scene of his opera Goyescas. His librettist Fernando Periquet y Zuaznabar provided a metrically suitable Spanish text which begins \\"¬øPor qu√© entre sombras el ruise√±or?\\" While the piano version is a standard part of the repertoire for that instrument, the opera is not often performed, perhaps because of the deficiencies of the libretto.

Historical background  The PKWN Manifesto, officially issued on 22 July 1944. One of the deciding points in post World War II history was the Yalta Conference where decisions regarding postwar Europe were taken and the continent became divided with the Iron Curtain. As a result, Poland remained under the Soviet Union's dominance. Formally was a separate country, in reality it couldn't make independent decisions without Moscow's approval. The power was held by Polish United Worker's Party (Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza, PZPR). The party stayed in power not because of the social support but because of suppressing society and military support from Moscow. The ties with the Soviet Union were declared through the PKWN Manifesto where the legitimacy of the coming State National Council, a Soviet-backed administration was announced. A citizen reads the PKWN Manifesto (of the Polish Committee of National Liberation), July 22, 1944 - a symbolic photo of the communist propaganda, copied in numerous books. During that time many citizens were working in government-owned companies, managed by people approved by the authorities, often as a result of political decisions.Hajdasz E., Kiewel G., ≈Åukaszka E., Mazur P., Tucznio H., Lekcje o wsp√≥≈Çczesne Polsce, Polski O≈õrodek Naukowy Uniwersytetu Jagiello≈Ñskiego w Londynie (3 February 2014) Their influence of a communistic rule was far beyond that. The economy was centrally planned, with all the prices and amount of the goods on the market regulated by the government officials. That time standing in the queues to purchase basic goods were part of daily life for all the residents. The government also interfered in people's personal life. There was no place for fundamental rights. People could gather to assembly or create their party, the PZPR was the only legal one. Censorship was imposed, atheism was strongly promoted, surveillance and invigilation were widely spread by eavesdropping on telephone conversations, violating the confidentiality of the correspondence, and spying. The Ministry of Public Security (Ministerstwo Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa Publicznego) with Security Services (S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecz≈Ñstwa, SB) is a representation of such actions that aimed to espy and eradicate anti- communist structures. The example of the repressions towards anti-communist activists can be a history of Polish general Leopold Okulicki and the Trial of the Sixteen. It's hard to estimate those hurt or killed by the actions directed by the communistic government. The changes in the Constitution of Poland were introduced and the Constitution of the Polish People's Republic passed in 1952. The changes included the new name of the country, the Polish People's Republic (Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa, PRL), the Polish Council of State replaced the office of the President of Poland, the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) became constitutionally a source of highest power, and other. Changes started to appear in the fifties due to the growing public resistance and some following circumstances. In 1953 Joseph Stalin died, his death initiated a 'thaw‚Äô period in Soviet Union and other dependent, communistic countries. The cult of personality started to be condemned and terror lessened. Another factor influencing the situation in Poland was a mysterious death of its president Boles≈Çaw Bierut in 1956.  Beginnings of the dissident movements  Imposed political system and constant suppression influenced people's lives. Million people were arrested, thousands became fatal victims of the terror, Security Service (SB) investigated millions of people. Citizens, including workers started to rise their voices regarding constantly violated human rights and overall discontent. People called for reforms. In June 1956 the worker's strike in Pozna≈Ñ took place and gathered over 100 000 people. The strike met a brutal response from the government, resulting in up to hundred deaths. It was a beginning of the changes that were about to happen. At the beginning, even though the W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka became a new communistic leader in the Polish People's Republic. He had a support of the society as none person before. the country didn't manage to gain the political and economic independence from SSSR. After W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka took power, the community hoped for the lessening restrictions. However, the restrictions didn't stop, including the censorship of the culture what resulted in students' protest in 1968. Further protests escalated, in December 1970 workers in northern Poland are protesting because of the increase in meat prices. The protests of 1970 were bloodily suppressed by the militia and the army resulting in deaths of 45 people, approximately 1165 casualties and around 146 people being arrested. Due to further incidents, people didn't want a reformation of the system, they started calling for changing the system. Because of the social disapprove, the authorities in Poland changed, though the communistic system still remained. Seventies were the years when quality of the life has improved and on the market you could find more and more foreign goods. Due to credits development was possible but the result wasn't the one expected. Factories and public services began to be modernized, stores equipped with local goods. The government managed by Edward Gierek (leader of Poland between 1970 and 1980) run into severe debt. In 1978 Bank of England they warned that PRL would not be able to repay the loans. However, the decade ended with the recession, development backed up by the loans was only effective for a short period of time. The loans that the government then took, were paid back in 2012. The decade ensured how the communistic system is inefficient and the following recession caused a series of strikes (described in the currents of dissidence paragraph).  Influence of the religion on the dissident movements  Main article: Polish anti-religious campaign Important role in fighting communism had a common religion of the Polish society. Over 90% of the society defined themselves as Catholics. Religion is thought to be something that brought people together giving hope and a feeling of participation. After World War II authorities continuously run Polish anti- religious campaign aimed at (inter alia) the Catholic Church in Poland. In 1956 the limitations were eased and the Church leaders became more active in the society with cardinal Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski in the lead. 1966 was an important year for Polish citizens, country celebrated the Millennium of the Polish State and at the same 1000 years of the Christianization of Poland. The anniversary was used by both the church and the ruling party for the propaganda purposes. Communistic government wanted to focus on the celebration without the religious context presenting it as the Millennium of the Polish State. On the other hand, the Catholic Church wanted to underline the relationship between Catholicism and the Polish State and their common origins since establishment of the Polish State started from the baptism. Not only Catholic Church in Poland was confronted. The communistic government aimed their actions towards other religions including Jewish Community in Poland, resulting in migration of thousands of them.  Groups of dissidence  * The Workers' Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Robotnik√≥w, KOR) * Movement of Young Poland (Ruch M≈Çodej Polski) * Students' Solidarity Committees (Studenckie Komitety Solidarno≈õci) * Movement for Defense of Human and Civil Rights (Ruch Obrony Praw Cz≈Çowieka i Obywatela, ROBCiO) * Free Trade Unions of the Coast (Wolne ZwiƒÖzki Zawodowe Wybrze≈ºa, WZZW)  Currents of dissidence = Strikes  In June 1976 the plan for raising goods' prices was revealed. The decision was motivated by the worsening economic situation in the Polish People's Republic. The raise would include basic commodities and influence significantly budget of the Polish households. It resulted in a social dissatisfaction and a series of large-scale social demonstrations, named June 1976 protests. As a part of the preparation, the government trained Motorized Reserves of the Citizens' Militia (Zmotoryzowane Odwody Milicji Obywatelskiej, ZOMO) - elite units of Citizens' Militia (MO) to quell demonstrations. The information about the increase resulted in protests starting the next day on 25 June 1976. The government expected the riots to be focused in bigger cities such as Warsaw, Krakow, Szczecin, Gdansk, or Upper Silesia. However, the protests centers were Radom, Warsaw's suburb of Ursus, and P≈Çock. After a few days of riots, the government decided to take back the decision and the news regarding riots were suppressed. However, the participants faced big repressions with legal charges, years in prison, or being beaten including those in need of hospitalization. Because of the continuing economic crisis, the government introduced ration stamps (Kartki). From 1976 \\"kartki\\" were necessary for everyone to buy even basic products.  Formation of a dissidence  After World War II, the communist system allowed trade unions (after 1939, under German occupation those were prohibited). Originally planned as an instrument of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) to prevent for instance solidarity movements, later met with resistance of the participants, resulting in many further confrontations and strikes. In September 1976 group of intellectuals founded the Workers' Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Robotnik√≥w, KOR). Its main goal was to provide financial, legal, and medical support to those repressed by the government after demonstrations or another form of dissidence. The group was also gathering signatures to release people from detention and was raising funds for the affected families by the disciplinary dismissals. Hunger-strikes became their common form of pressuring the authorities. = Murder of Stanis≈Çaw Pyjas = Stanis≈Çaw Pyjas, a student cooperating with KOR was murdered in May 197. His death agitated the society and caused a series of protests resulting in furthers arrests. In many cities students' KOR committees started appearing. In the end, the government ceased persecution and declared an amnesty for the participants the riots. = KOR reorganization and ROBCiO creation = In 1977 the Workers' Defence Committee was reorganized into the Committee for Social Self-defence (Komitet Samoobrony Spo≈Çecznej KOR). Further development of the committee was motivated by the lack of support for repressed people from the national organizations designated for that. The goal of the committee was to put an initiative for different forms of defense. Their aim was also to provide information about the persecutions as they have perceived revealing the actions of the authorities to the public the only effective way of defense where Zofia Romaszewska and her husband Zbigniew Romaszewski held significant actions. They coordinated and registered the cases of humans rights violations in Poland and spread the information to the world. On 25 March 1977 the Movement for Defense of Human and Civic Rights (Ruch Obrony Praw Cz≈Çowieka i Obywatela, ROPCiO) was established. Both of those organizations supported creating independent workers' unions. Members of the ROBCiO co-organized the underground press called another circulation (Polish: drugi obieg) and published several magazines, books, leaflets. Created by students Independent Publishing House NOWA (Polish: Niezale≈ºna Oficyna Wydawnicza NOWA) became the largest publisher in Communist Poland. In 1979 Leszek Moczulski created Confederation of Independent Poland (Konfederacja Polski Niepodleg≈Çej KPN). It was the first one anti-communistic party in the Easter Communist Bloc. = Winter of 1978/1979 = The winter of 1978/1978 really sudden and showed how inefficient the government can be even when dealing with natural occurrences. Besides big amount of snow, the temperatures went down to -30 Celsius degrees. For almost a month the factories weren't able to operate. The government was calling citizens for help. Although they tried to introduce some solutions, their efforts were unsuccessful. = Pope John Paul II = On the 16th of October 1978 Polish cardinal Karol Wojty≈Ça was elected pope. He got the name Pope John Paul II. Since most of the society was catholic, the election of a Pole as pope raised hope in the Polish community. The Pope also supported anti-communist narrative which caused concern among communists. The authorities of the USSR expressed opposition to the Pope's visit to Poland, however, Edward Gierek allowed the Pope to make a pilgrimage to Poland in June 1979. About 6 million people took part in the visit. Joint prayers made Poles to see how much strength they create together.

USA Network (1981‚Äì1983) Beginning in the 1981‚Äì82 season, the USA Network would broadcast a Friday night Game of the Week. USA employed Al Trautwig and Kyle Rote Jr. as their primary broadcasting crew. Despite the great exposure during its two-year deal with USA, MISL officials were continuously inquiring about how much they were paying them. USA told the MISL's television committee that they weren't getting any big ratings and couldn't pay them. To put things into perspective, the USA Network during its infancy, only had about 1.3 million subscribers. And an even smaller percentage of those subscribers watched sports programming, much less indoor soccer. CBS (1983‚Äì1985) On May 7, 1983, the MISL made its network television debut on CBS, who carried the playoff game between the Baltimore Blast and Cleveland Crunch in Cleveland. CBS used this particular game as counter-programming against the Kentucky Derby on ABC. Ultimately however, CBS only got a 2.4 rating and 6 share. John Tesh and Al Trautwig called this very first broadcast for CBS. The following year on June 2, CBS broadcast Baltimore-St. Louis Steamers championship series game from St. Louis. This time, the ratings sunk to a 1.5 rating and 6 share. On May 25, 1985, CBS showed Game 4 of the championship series between the San Diego Sockers and the Baltimore Blast. This would be the final year the MISL would have games aired on network television. For this final game, CBS used Gary Bender and Kyle Rote Jr. on commentary. ESPN (1985‚Äì1987) The MISL landed a steady national TV contract for the first time since 1983 when they were on USA, as ESPN would televise 15 regular-season games on Sunday afternoons, the All-Star Game and assorted playoff games. beginning in the 1985‚Äì86 season. The MISL received no broadcast revenues from ESPN. In other words, the agreement with ESPN to had the league pay the cable network to televise its games. Bill Kentling, director and general manager of the Wichita Wings, was vehemently against the ESPN deal, thinking that was ridiculous to go against the National Football League without having any time to set up sponsorship. Commissioner Frank Dale however, disagreed with Kentling's assessment saying: ‚ÄúIf I held out waiting for money for the rights for something that has traditionally not done well in the ratings, we‚Äôd still be off the air.‚Äù Ultimately, the MISL got only three sponsors for the weekly telecasts on ESPN. For the 1986‚Äì87 season, ESPN actually paid the MISL a fee instead of the league paying the network, as it had done the previous season. This time, ESPN would broadcast 18 games, including the All-Star Game from Los Angeles, as well as four playoff games. The San Diego Sockers were scheduled be on four delayed telecasts during the regular season. On commentary, ESPN employed JP Dellacamera, Bob Kurtz, Bob Ley, and Bob Carpenter on play-by-play with Ty Keough, Seamus Malin, and Shep Messing as analysts. FNN/Score (1987‚Äì1989) The MISL marked the 1987‚Äì88 by signing a two-year TV agreement with FNN/Score. This package included a Friday game of the week, as well as the all-star game, the entire championship series and a weekly highlight show. In San Diego (home of the Sockers), the games were not seen locally because FNN went off the air in San Diego before the games began. JP Dellacamera and Ty Keough were the primary broadcast team for FNN/Score. ESPN (1989‚Äì1990) The MISL would return to ESPN in time for the 1989‚Äì90 season, when they reached agreement with ESPN for a nine game TV schedule. ESPN would also televise MISL playoff games on May 2, 17, 24, 27 and June 9. The last game was expected to be broadcast live. The others tape- delayed, but shown the same day. SportsChannel America (1990‚Äì1992) As previously mentioned, the Major Indoor Soccer League, was known in its final two seasons as the Major Soccer League. At this time, commissioner Don Foreman had hoped to escalate the MSL's nine-game tape-delay ESPN contract into a live contract come the 1990‚Äì91 season. But a deal never came off, and Foreman had to settle for a 15-game live contract with SportsChannel America. The first year of what would be a two-year deal included 10 regular-season Sunday afternoon games billed and marketed as a \\"game of the week\\", the All-Star Game from Kansas City's Kemper Arena and four playoff games. The only game that was not broadcast live was a March 10, 1991 game between the Baltimore Blast and San Diego Sockers in San Diego. The game was played Saturday night and then shown on tape delay the next day at 4:05 p.m., Baltimore time. SportsChannel's coverage began February 3, 1991 with the Wichita Wings playing at the Kansas City Comets. The rest of the regular-season schedule included: February 10 -- Cleveland at Tacoma; February 17 -- Wichita at Dallas; February 24 -- Kansas City at Cleveland; March 3 -- Tacoma at St. Louis; March 10 -- Baltimore at San Diego; March 17 -- Cleveland at Dallas; March 24 -- Wichita at Cleveland; March 31 -- St. Louis at San Diego; April 7 -- St. Louis at Wichita. John Griffin, MSL director of communications who put the TV schedule together, said Baltimore's inability to start its Sunday home games at 4:05 p.m. prevented the Blast from being televised more often on SportsChannel. In the middle of what would be MSL's final season, 1991‚Äì92, commissioner Earl Foreman held preliminary talks with SportsChannel concerning added MSL coverage should the National Hockey League's strike continue. At the time, SportsChannel also held the American broadcasting rights to the NHL. Ultimately however, the NHL strike would only last for ten days. Come playoff time, SportsChannel would televise six playoff games. Earl Foreman said that owners decided to use all six telecasts on the championship series. JP Dellacamera and Ty Keough served as the primary broadcast crew for SportsChannel.

The case made headlines in both Singapore and Australia. Initially convicted twice for the deaths of Tan and Tay, Tiwary was acquitted upon his second appeal and freed nine years after the murders. The murders remain unsolved. Murder On 15 September 2003, two Singaporeans ‚Äì 26-year-old Tay Chow Lyang and 27-year-old Tony Tan Poh Chuan ‚Äì were found murdered in their flat in Sydney, Australia. Tay had been bludgeoned to death and Tan was murdered when he returned from a university lecture. The victims' 24-year-old flatmate and fellow Singaporean, Ram Puneet Tiwary, who happened to be asleep in his room at the time of the murders, was awakened by sounds of violence. He locked himself in his room and called the ambulance and police upon seeing his flatmates' bodies. Tiwary, together with both Tay and Tan, attended the same class at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) at that time for an engineering course on an army scholarship. Trials, appeals and acquittal Initially a police witness, Ram Puneet Tiwary was charged with murder 9 months later on 28 May 2004. The prosecution alleged that Tiwary may have possible motives to commit the crime. They claimed Tiwary owed Tay Chow Lyang an outstanding amount of in rent. Tiwary also owed UNSW school fees, and his poor grades may potentially jeopardise his scholarship which would have required him to repay his sponsoring organisation. A scene of a dispute had erupted between Tiwary and Tay in that morning resulting in the death of Tay, and subsequently the death of Tony Tan Poh Chuan as well to cover up the earlier act. At the trial, a 12-member jury found Tiwary, who maintained his innocence throughout, guilty of the double murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment without parole in 2006. In his memoir, Tiwary posited a possibility that racism could have been behind his guilty verdict. During his period of imprisonment, he had been a target of several other inmates in prison for assault. These attacks left him with a partial loss of sensation in his right thumb and a scarred left shoulder. Tiwary filed an appeal, and in 2008, the Court of Appeal ordered a re-trial for Tiwary, based on the review of evidence, in which some of them did not amount to a murder conviction. A year later, at the re-trial, the jury returned again with a guilty verdict, sentencing Tiwary to 48 years' imprisonment. Tiwary made a second appeal against his conviction and sentence. The second appeal was focused on Tiwary's tone in his phone call to the ambulance, the victims' unusual behaviour on the day of the murder as witnessed by several people and the forensic evidence. The Court of Appeal decided that the evidence against Tiwary was not satisfactory, therefore they found him not guilty of the murders of both Tay and Tan, and acquitted Tiwary of the double murder charges on 26 July 2012. Aftermath After his acquittal, Tiwary was detained for a while before he was allowed to return to Singapore. On 19 September 2012, Tiwary once again stepped onto Singaporean soil. He declined speaking to reporters out of respect for the bereaved families of his two dead flatmates. When told of the news of Tiwary's acquittal, Tony Tan's family expressed shock over the news, and were said to be once again at a loss over the events. The family of Tay Chow Lyang could not be contacted. Back in Australia, the prosecution confirmed they will not appeal against the decision of the appellate court. After returning to Singapore, Tiwary penned down a memoir, titled 99 Months: The Case Of The Sydney Double Murders, which covers the case, as well as Tiwary's two trials, his experiences in prison, appeals and his eventual acquittal. It was published in September 2014. At the time of publication, Tiwary was 35 years old. It is also mentioned in an article that Tiwary had made a trip around the world after his return to Singapore, and did not complete the mechanical engineering degree from Sydney. Other than that, Tiwary did not make any further comments about his private life. Even till then, he still struggles with his trauma from the events that occurred these past 8 years. The case was made into a documentary by Channel NewsAsia (CNA), in which Tiwary or his family declined to appear on screen. Tony Tan's parents Mr Tan Wee Sea and Mdm Chiew Lee Hua, and his sister Tan Poh Lin, were approached to talk about their feelings regarding the case, while Tay's family remains uncontactable. The murderer(s) of Tay and Tan were not found.

It is set in Leningrad in 1952, ten years after the Siege of Leningrad, and takes place during political repression in the Soviet Union and the plot against doctors in the Stalin era. The book was longlisted for the 2010 Man Booker Prize, and shortlisted for the 2011 Commonwealth Writer's Prize and the Orwell Prize. The Betrayal is the second of a two-book series. The first, The Siege was published in 2001 and is set in Leningrad during the siege. Synopsis Anna, Andrei and Kolya have survived the siege of Leningrad. Anna and Andrei marry and live in the city where she is a nursery-school teacher and he is a paediatrician at the local hospital. It is 1952 and they live in Joseph Stalin's repressive regime where it is prudent not to draw attention to yourself. Andrei unwittingly takes on the case of a young boy, Gorya, who has a cancerous tumour in his leg. The child is the son of Volkov, a Commissar of State Security, and while Andrei knows the dangers if things go wrong, he is determined to give the boy the best possible care. Andrei tells Volkov the only course of action to prevent the cancer spreading is to amputate Gorya's leg. Volkov is unhappy with this decision, particularly because Brodskaya, the surgeon who will perform the operation, is Jewish. Andrei insists that she is an excellent surgeon and Volkov reluctantly agrees to the amputation. The operation is successful, and after intensive physiotherapy, Gorya is discharged. Several months later Gorya returns. The cancer was not contained and has spread to his lungs. Volkov accuses Andrei of butchering Gorya for no reason and of being part of a conspiracy by doctors to murder Soviet leaders. Andrei is arrested and taken to Lubyanka prison in Moscow. Anna tries to elicit help from some of Andrei's colleagues, but they all shun her for fear of being implicated themselves. She sends Andrei money, but has no way of knowing whether it gets through to him. Andrei is subjected to brutal interrogation, which includes prolonged sleep deprivation. After several weeks he is interviewed by Volkov, who tells Andrei that Brodskaya was also arrested, but \\"suffered a heart attack\\". He promises to spare Andrei if he signs a document admitting \\"insufficient vigilance\\". Andrei signs the \\"confession\\" and is exiled to Siberia for 10 years. When news arrives that Stalin has died, an uneasy calm descends over the country. The Doctor's plot is ruled to have been a fabrication, and all sentenced doctors are freed. Andrei slowly makes his way back home, while Anna wonders if she will see him again. Reception In a review in BookBrowse, Sarah Sacha Dollacker called The Betrayal \\"[a] powerful novel\\" with \\"expertly drawn\\" characters, convincing dialogue and believable conflicts. Unlike some historical fiction that places the emphasis on setting rather than characters, Dollacker opined that Dunmore uses her characters to \\"paint\\" the setting for her. British poet Carol Rumens wrote in The Independent that Dunmore's dialogue is \\"powerful\\" and \\"subtle\\", and connects the book's two adversaries, Volkov and Andrei \\"in a way that shocks, surprises and moves us\\". She praised the author's depiction of children, adding that Gorya \\"is hauntingly portrayed\\". Reviewing The Betrayal in The Guardian, Susanna Rustin described the novel as \\"an absorbing and thoughtful tale of good people in hard times\\". She praised the author's \\"meticulous\\" research into Soviet bureaucracy, hospitals and Leningrad at the time. Rustin remarked that while The Betrayal \\"falls far short\\" of other historical works, like Pat Barker's Regeneration trilogy, Dunmore's \\"intelligence and gift for narrative\\" makes her books something to look forward to. Jane Shilling wrote in The Telegraph that The Betrayal is a \\"lovely, thoughtful novel\\". She said the book's \\"impalpable apprehension\\", Andrei's conflict between his doctor's instinct to heal and his \\"panic- stricken desire\\" to protect his family, \\"is chillingly described\\". But Shilling felt that once apprehension turns to horror, Dunmore's \\"power to disturb weaken[s]\\". What happens to Andrei \\"has become so familiar that it is hard to find original ways to write about it\\".

It was part of unidivided Medak district of Telangana state.The rulers of this Samsthanam had marital relations with famous Gadwal Samsthanam. Popular rulers of Samsthanam were Rai Bagan Maharani Shankaramma and Raja Sadashiva Reddy. History Erstwhile Papannapet Samsthanam covered almost entire undivided Medak district. In the history it was said as part of Andhol Rajyam with 24 paraganas and was ruled by the princess Rai Bagan Maharani Shankaramma, daughter of Sanga Reddy and Rajamma. She was born in 1702 at Gaudicherla Village. The ruler of Papannapet Samsthanam Ramadurga Venkata Narasimha Reddy (1720-1760) married her for her bravery. After the demise of Raja Narasimha Reddy in 1760, the power of Samsthanam went to in to the hands of Rani Lingayamma II (1760-64) with the prevailing political situations. When Peshwa of Maratha Empire invaded Nizam's territory, Rani Shankaramma countered them, for which she was honoured with Rai Bagan (Royal Tigress) title and was restored to power as Rani of Samsthanam in 1764. She then built Sangareddi, named after her father Sanga Reddy Rajampet, named after her mother Rajamma. She was also credited with the building of Shankarampet after her name and Papannapet named after Merelli Papanna. She adopted Sadashiva Reddy who married Parvathi Devi, daughter of Gadwal Samsthanam ruler Somanatha Bhupala. Sadashivapet was named after her adopted son Raja Sadashiva Reddy. Rani Shankaramma died in 1774. Papannapet Samsthanam, which was already in legal disputes by the early 20th century after the death of Raja Durga Reddy was merged into Hyderabad State in 1948, during the rule of Raja Ramachandra Reddy Bahadur. In the history Rani Shankaramma was compared with Rani Ahilya Bhai and Rani Rudrama Devi by historians for her administrative skills and valour. She was credited with agricultural development such as constructing ponds and was regarded as a social reformer for her acts of making Neerudi Papanna, a dalit as commander. Many folkloric stories were sung describing her valour. Historians such as B.N.Shastri said that Papannapet Samsthanam history is clearly recorded from the rule of Rani Shankaramma. Suravaram Prathapa Reddy mentioned Rani Shankaramma and Raja Sadashiva Reddy in \\"Golconda Patrika\\". Chidire Lakshmana Shastri who was the Raja purohit of Samsthanam published the history of Samsthanam titled \\"Medak Rajula Charitra\\" (1979-80) by gathering information from the books such as \\"Maa Poorva Vamshavali\\" by Rani Lingayamma, \\"Maa Vamsha Charitra\\" written in Urdu by Raja Venkata Narasimha Reddy, \\"Maa Samsthana Charitra\\", \\"Lingayamma Charitra\\" by Venkatadwari, Tirumalacharya's \\"Shaurya Rajya Vamshavali\\", \\"Shrimajjoginatha Charitra\\" by Mudigonda Ramakrishna Kavi.

Co-founded by Sergio Marqu√©s and Jose Macarro in Barcelona, Dani L√≥pez joined them in 1995 and they are still in charge of the magazine. By 2019, Mondo Sonoro had a circulation of 125.000 monthly copies and over two million visits to its website every year. Mondo Sonoro is distributed every month in clothes shops, discos, pubs and music venues for free, in eight regional divisions of Spain (Madrid, Catalonia- Balearic Islands, Valencian Community, Basque Country, Asturias-Cantabria, Galicia-Castille and Le√≥n, Arag√≥n, and Andalusia-Murcia-Extremadura), having a local edition for each area. The magazine organises the yearly events Fiesta Demosc√≥pica and Plaza Sonora, both serving as springboards for emerging bands.  History  Mondo Sonoro was founded in 1994 by Sergio Marqu√©s and Jose Macarro, two university students from Barcelona. The magazine evolved from their previous fanzine entitled BUM (Bolet√≠n Universitario Musical, translated as University's Music Bulletin). The magazine's first issue was published in October 1994, including reviews of shows by Red Hot Chili Peppers and Mano Negra. Using a rotary press, within the first year they distributed between 15.000 and 20.000 monthly copies of Mondo Sonoro in Barcelona, being the second independent magazine to reach that number after ABarna. The following year they were joined by commercial director Dani L√≥pez. In 1996, the magazine expanded its coverage to Madrid and by 1998 it had seven regional editions across the country. In 1997, it was launched a website for the magazine and in March 2000 they began collaborating with Terra Networks. As of that year, Mondo Sonoro had around 30.000 and 40.000 monthly visits to its website. Since 1999, Mondo Sonoro has organised the yearly Fiestas Demosc√≥picas free tour, where a group of emerging bands without any album are chosen to perform after they sent their demos to the magazine. In 2018, the magazine partnered with Matadero Madrid to launch Plaza Sonora, a 12-hour free show realised each year at the venue, and also including workshops, exhibitions and talks. To mark the 20th anniverssary of Mondo Sonoro in October 2014, the bands Sidonie, Love of Lesbian, Dorian and Standstill, all linked to the magazine from their beginnings, performed at Razzmatazz in Barcelona. Celebrating the magazine's 25th anniversary in 2019, there was a special show in Madrid in addition to the release of a compilation album featuring bands who appeared in the magazine during their formative years. In April 2020, Mondo Sonoro published its first online issue due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and started a podcast series on this issue as well.

The carefully planned operation made it seem at first as if a courier had been mugged on 2 May, yet City of London police soon realised that it was a sophisticated global venture which ended up involving participants such as the New York mafia, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), and Colombian drug barons. The robbery took advantage of the existence of a messenger system which moved vast sums of money around the City of London in order to ensure liquidity in the UK financial system. The money was in the form of certificates of deposit and HM Treasury bills. These bearer bonds were recovered in different places including Glasgow, New York, Miami (on their way to Peru), and Z√ºrich. In a wide-ranging investigation, the police eventually recovered all but two of the 301 certificates, with some of those arrested allegedly turning informant, such as Mark Osborne, who was later found murdered. Patrick Thomas, who allegedly carried out the original theft, was also shot dead. Keith Cheeseman, an extravagant fraudster, was arrested in the UK but skipped bail to Tenerife, claiming his life was in danger. He was briefly thought to have been the Bolney Torso and then was located and arrested in Spain. Cheeseman was extradited to the US to stand charges of money laundering and received a six and a half year sentence. John Traynor was arrested for a mortgage fraud using the stolen bonds as collateral; he was sentenced to seven years for handling stolen goods. He escaped after a year and a half but was arrested in the Netherlands in 2010 and extradited back to the UK to serve the rest of his sentence. The robbery was one of the largest in world history.  Planning  The idea for the robbery was generated by media reports in January 1990 that a courier had accidentally dropped ¬£4 million (equivalent to ¬£ million in ) worth of bearer bonds on their way to the Bank of England. A twenty-three year-old surveyor had picked up the four certificates of deposit on Throgmorton Street outside the Stock Exchange, after they had fallen out of the briefcase of a courier working for Rowe & Pitman, a subsidiary of S. G. Warburg & Co.. When he gave them back, he was rewarded with a magnum of Laurent-Perrier champagne. Upon hearing this story, an organised crime syndicate realised that if a courier was mugged, they could reap a massive haul, since bearer bonds entitle whoever is carrying them to the money denoted on them. The certificates were issued every week by the Bank of England as a means to manage short term spending needs, ensuring that there was always liquidity in the system. The bills matured after one to six months and were freely traded, until the system became electronic in the mid-2000s. Care was taken to make the theft appear to be an opportunistic mugging, since the bonds would be cancelled if it was suspected to have been a heist ordered by an organised crime group. The syndicate planned to quickly launder the bonds as quickly as possible in Z√ºrich.  Robbery  alt=Narrow street in City of London On the morning of 2 May 1990, 58-year-old John Goddard, an employee of financial brokers Sheppards (a subsidiary of Cater Allen) was walking along Nicholas Lane, an alleyway in the City of London. He was carrying 301 certificates worth ¬£291.9 million (equivalent to ¬£ million in ) in bearer bonds in a briefcase, of which ¬£121.9 million were certificates of deposit and ¬£170 million were HM Treasury bills. Suddenly a young man in his twenties appeared and mugged Goddard at knifepoint; the robber is widely believed to have been Patrick Thomas. At first, it seemed the operation had gone according to plan, despite reports the next day in The Times which declared the heist had gathered a \\"worthless haul\\" and that \\"the perpetrator stands to make not a penny from the crime\\". The Bank of England was supplying false information to the media on purpose; whilst it had informed financial institutions worldwide of the serial numbers, the bonds could still be cashed. The Swiss connection which was supposed to launder the money did not work out, therefore the syndicate was forced to seek other options in the criminal underworld. The New York mafia became interested, since they were already involved in a scheme to launder US bonds in London. The contact man in the UK was Keith Cheeseman, who had previously made false loan applications to support a lavish lifestyle which included becoming chairperson of Dunstable Town FC. Back in 1975, he had been charged with extorting ¬£287,000 and remanded for a week, after arriving at court in a silver chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce; he later received a six- year sentence for conspiracy to defraud the Beneficial Finance and Loan Society with 318 fictitious loan applications. Told about the heist, Cheeseman went to work, liaising with associates such as Raymond Ketteridge. He sent some of the stolen bonds to Mark Osborne in the US, who then met up with mafioso Tony Dipiono in a New York bar and delivered ten bonds, each worth ¬£1 million. However, Dipiono was an FBI agent and Osborne was arrested, subsequently deciding to betray his associates. The FBI allegedly recorded the conversations between Osborne and Cheeseman until Osborne disappeared in August 1990 and was later found murdered.  Recovery  The syndicate in London came to realise that it was also infiltrated by an informer, since the City of London police swiftly began to recover the bonds. The police had initially hoped the mugging was no more than an accident and the certificates would be found discarded, yet the evidence built up that it was a sophisticated plan and thus Operation Starling was set up. Soon they had reports of a bond turning up in Northern Ireland and someone tried to deposit a bond at a Natwest bank in Glasgow. In summer 1990, 80 certificates worth ¬£77 million were recovered during an allegedly routine check at Heathrow Airport on a flight arriving from Dublin. Three Irish men were arrested and customs stated \\"We did not know the bonds were coming in. We found them by pure chance\\". In fact the men had been under surveillance, since one of them was Thomas Coyle, a known fence. Coyle had quickly acquired 80 of the stolen bonds and realising their enormous value had recruited John Gilligan and Jim \\"Danger\\" Beirne to help sell them. Not being able to shift them in Ireland, they devised a plan to sell them to mafia connections in the US via John Francis Conlon, who had connections to various security agencies and arms dealers such as Monzer al-Kassar and Oliver North. The plan was sabotaged at the first stage when Coyle, Anthony Rooney and Edward Dunne were all arrested at Heathrow. The bonds were discovered in Rooney's luggage and all three men maintained their innocence. When the case came to trial at Knightsbridge Crown Court, all three were released on technicalities. Coyle later bought a racehorse which he named 77 Mill. Operation Starling retrieved ¬£80 million worth of bonds in Cyprus and other raids occurred in the Netherlands, Scotland, Singapore and West Germany. A link to the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) was revealed in September 1990, when a man left a package at the Aeroper√∫ offices in Miami to be delivered to Lima in Peru. A search by US Customs revealed that the package contained ¬£71 million in stolen bonds, which the IRA was attempting to trade with Colombian drug barons in exchange for money and narcotics. The smugglers had hidden the bonds in two Miami phonebooks. Raymond Ketteridge was arrested with another man and charged with handling ¬£70 million in stolen bonds, only to see his prosecution dropped in London in July 1991. He later won his battle against extradition from Cyprus to the US in 1994. He had been facing charges of money laundering based on the heist. The police also foiled a mortgage scam which aimed to use stolen bonds as collateral, arresting John Traynor in 1990.  Death of Patrick Thomas  Thomas lived on the Turnham Road council estate in Brockley, south London, with his step-sister and her family. He presented himself as merely being an ordinary person on the estate, whilst being involved in criminal enterprises such as drug-dealing and robbery. When he and David Summerville were caught red-handed cutting up a kilo of cocaine in March 1991, they were remanded to Belmarsh Prison, then he managed to convince the jury that his co- defendant was responsible for the ¬£30,000 haul of cocaine and thus was acquitted, whilst Summerville received a seven-year sentence. Career criminal Jimmy Tippett Junior writes in his autobiography Born Gangster that Patrick Thomas showed him the bonds in a toilet cubicle soon after robbing Goddard. Tippett was arrested in relation to the robbery and had his charges dropped before court. According to Tippett, he had been drinking with Thomas earlier in the evening of 28 December and then became separated from him when Thomas refused to be searched by a bouncer because he was carrying a gun. In the early morning of 29 December 1991, after hearing a scuffle and a bang at the front door Thomas' step-sister found him lying on the ground with a gunshot wound to the head. He died from his injuries as she called for an ambulance. At first, police believed that Thomas had been killed by friends of Summerville, but it soon became clear that Thomas was involved in other crimes since he had assorted building society accounts with over ¬£150,000 in them and he was eventually connected to the bonds robbery as the suspected mugger.  Arrest of Keith Cheeseman  Keith Cheeseman was arrested in the UK after an investigation by City of London police and the FBI. He was sentenced to six and a half year term but had managed to flee the country whilst on bail. The Today newspaper ran a story 26 October 1991 entitled \\"¬£290m clue to headless corpse\\" which stated Cheeseman had been found decapitated in Bolney, Sussex. However, the Bolney Torso was not Cheeseman, who was actually on the run in Tenerife. A man who stopped to urinate on his way home found the body in a wooded area, wrapped up in a carpet with neither head nor hands. The body was laid to rest in 1994, then dug up again in 2009 for extended forensic testing, which suggested the man was from Bavaria in Germany and had spent about a year in the UK before his murder. A German fraudster was identified as living nearby in Haywards Heath at the time, but police investigations have never linked him to the crime in any way. the corpse is still unidentified. After his arrest in Spain, Cheeseman was extradited to the US, where he faced charges related to a conspiracy to launder ¬£392 million in stolen bonds, including the ¬£292 million obtained in London. Cheeseman claimed he had skipped bail in fear for his life and pled guilty, admitting he had processed ¬£16 million in bonds. Judge Robert W. Sweet sentenced him to the maximum available term of six and a half years because he had attempted to evade justice and because of his criminal past. Cheeseman had also been involved in another fraud scheme, in which he had seduced a supervisor at a financial services company. He rented her a luxury apartment and they conspired to transfer ¬£8 million into an offshore account, before the two were arrested by the City Fraud Squad. Arrest of John Traynor John Traynor escaped a dispute with criminal associate Martin Cahill in Ireland by moving to England in the late 1980s. He then reacquainted himself with old friend James \\"Danger\\" Beirne who was involved in various fraudulent schemes. The two men joined with John Francis Conlon to set up a new venture in which they would attempt to use some of the stolen bonds as collateral investment for a mortgage from a Swiss bank. Conlon had connections to Miami and presented plans for a fictitious ¬£100 million holiday resort on a Caribbean island. Using bonds with altered numbers, they managed to gain a ¬£200,000 advance in Geneva, although the bank sent warnings to City of London police and the Serious Fraud Office. When the courier returned to pick up the rest of the mortgage, the bank told him to wait so he called Traynor, who was sitting on a street near Bayswater Road in London. As they spoke, police swooped in both England and Switzerland, and they were both arrested. Traynor was charged with handling stolen goods and received a seven-year sentence. Traynor went to jail in July 1990 and quickly began planning his escape. As a reward for good behaviour he was transferred from HM Prison Wandsworth to HM Prison Highpoint in Suffolk. He then requested a temporary home leave to see his family and when that was granted in November 1992, he immediately took a flight to Dublin and escaped, secure in the knowledge that his offence would not lead to extradition from Ireland. However, Traynor was eventually arrested in the Netherlands in 2010, as part of a combined operation by British and Dutch police investigating organised crime across borders. He was then extradited back to the UK to serve the rest of his sentence.  Legacy  The City bonds robbery is seen as one of the largest heists in history in terms of the amount taken, dwarfing other UK crimes such as the Brink's-Mat robbery, the Great Train Robbery, the Knightsbridge Security Deposit robbery, the Northern Bank robbery and the Securitas depot robbery. Globally, it is insignificant compared to the 2003 robbery of almost $1 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) from the Central Bank of Iraq by Qusay Hussein, son of Saddam Hussein. The police ultimately recovered all but two of the 301 certificates that were stolen in the City bonds robbery. The Bank of England continues to use the bonds system to protect financial liquidity, but the last paper bills were produced in September 2003, when the entire process became electronic.

History The building, initially built according to the canons of Venetian- Byzantine architecture, was then renovated by adding Gothic elements during the 15th century. In 1894, famous Italian actress Eleonora Duse lived on the top floor of the building, being a guest of Russian count Alexander Wolkoff Mouronzov. Architecture Made almost entirely of red brick, the highly asymmetrical fa√ßade stands out for its extraordinary vertical development and a mix of details: it is divided into the ground floor, mezzanine, main floor, and two upper floors. The arrangement of the decorative elements apparently lacks any order and makes it difficult to analyze the ensemble. The structure is dominated by the polifora of the noble floor, decorated by pointed frames. The top levels have monofora, bifora, trifora, and quadrifora, all placed asymmetrically.

It is a long tradition that goes back to 1924 when anarchist young people from Frisia organized this meeting for the first time. In 1933, the campground in Appelscha was bought by anti-militarist workers, and it is here that the festival has taken place ever since, every year during the Pentecost on the anarchist, alcohol-free camping site Tot Vrijbezzinnen.  History  Appelscha The Frisian town of Appelscha has a long tradition of radical revolutionary socialism and anarchism, which started on March 30, 1889 when the anarchist Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis gave a speech to the village's dissatisfied workers. Since then, the village has had a reputation as a stronghold of socialism and anarchism. Here the combative agricultural workers formed the basis for the activities of Nieuwenhuis, workers strikes often took place in the village and around 1900 there was a large wave of strikes. The local anarchist youth organized a Pinksterlanddagen event for the first time in 1924 on the \\"Ter Vrijheidsbezinning\\" site (literally: \\"For Freedom of Mind\\"). A.J.

The initiative participants assume that all event participants feel jointly responsible as users of the site and have set up some rules for this: There are various containers for paper, glass and chemical waste in the village that should be used. There is also a container for normal waste in front of the site and a container for organic waste. No open fires on or around the campsite as there is a forest nearby. The site is accessible day and night, so make no noise at night. The terrain Ter Vrijheidsbezinning is antimilitaristic, alcohol and other drugs are not allowed. Energy saving measures should be observed. Other libertarian groups are also welcome. A large building is available for readings, events, workshops, meetings and more.

Contestants navigate an obstacle course in a room filled with 80,000 gallons of bright red goop that simulates hot lava. Winners receive 10,000 U.S. dollars and a trophy in the form of a lava lamp.  Production  The show is shot at an old disused Ikea in Burbank, California. Prior to finding the location, multiple Hollywood studios turned down the opportunity to host the show due to concern about its messiness. The actual formulation of the lava is a closely guarded secret which only a few crew members know. Showrunner Anthony Carbone has cited Panda Express's Orange Chicken as a close approximation. At one point, a proposal to add chemicals to make the lava glow in the dark was scrapped after the crew discovered that the formulation would render the lava toxic. In order not to break immersion, individual players do not use safety equipment. Instead, \\"every single object in the game is built and designed from scratch to be able to not only hold up to punishment but protect the contestants. Inspiration for the show includes the Indiana Jones and Night at the Museum film series. To the latter point, the setting was initially going to be a natural history museum before being changed to a mansion. Video games also were an influence in designing the levels, with the crew specifically citing Uncharted as an example.

He was one of the preeminent leaders of the Islamic Action Organisation. He is currently the director of Ayatollah Shirazi's public relations office in Iraq and has been holding this position since the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Nasrallah is the founder of the al-Wala' wa al-Fida' wa al-Fateh Association for religious conquests, an organisation that helps revive religious Shia sites that are affected by war or terrorism, as well as hold functions to commemorate the memory of the Ahl al-Bayt.  Early life  Nasrallah was born on June 17, 1958, to Muhammad Nasrallah, a merchant and servant at the al-Abbas shrine. Both of his parents hail from the noble Al Faiz family, and claim agnatic descent from Muhammad's daughter Fatimah and her husband, Ali, the first Shia Imam. His ancestors on some occasions ruled the city, and held custodianship of its holy sites. Nasrallah grew up in Karbala, and spent his childhood serving with his father. Nasrallah's life took a turn when his father died in 1969, and he was taken under the care of his brother-in-law, Ridha Al Talib. Nasrallah quickly came to realise the injustice the Baathist regime was projecting towards the Shia of Iraq and decided to join the risali movement, known as the Islamic Action Organisation (IOA)‚Äìfounded by Muhammad-Taqi al-Modarresi‚Äìin 1973. By 1976, he was wanted by the regime, because he was both, not enrolled in the army, which was obligatory at that time, and had been reported to the authorities as a member of al-Modarresi's illegal movement. In 1979, he was sentenced to death in absentia, whilst he was still in Karbala.  Combat History  Straight after his sentence, he fled to Kuwait, and remained there for just under a year. He then went to Iran, upon the start of the Iran-Iraq war, and carried on with the IAO, which was fully functional and operational in Iran. The IAO was also working with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and so the IRGC were impressed with Arif's capabilities, and decided to train him and send him out for combat missions abroad. He carried out numerous missions in Kurdistan in 1981. He fought alongside the Peshmerga in the Kurdish mountains until 1987, and then became the manager of the IOA's office in Kurdistan and settled there for ten years. In the nineties, the IOA began to disintegrate, and the leadership was divided into a number of factions. Because of this, Nasrallah began to gradually withdraw himself. He left Kurdistan for Iran, and settled in Qom. By November, 1996, two sons of Muhammad al-Shirazi (Murtadha and Mahdi) were imprisoned in Iran due to ongoing disputes between the government and the Shirazis promotion of the shura al-fuqaha (leadership of a council of jurists) ideology. When they were released three years later, al-Shirazi turned to Nasrallah for help‚Äìwho at that time had grown close to the Shirazis‚Äìto smuggle them out of Iran and go to Syria. After Nasrallah successfully transported both of al-Shirazi's sons, he returned to Iran. A little while after his arrival, he was imprisoned. A year later in prison, he was sentenced to death, but was then saved, following a decision by Mohammad Khatami to pardon a number of political prisoners, in an easing of the Islamic Republic's strict security policies. After he was let out, he remained in Qom, near al-Shirazi‚Äìwho was now pretty much alone, with most of his children and students abroad or in prison‚Äìfor approximately six months, until al-Shirazi insisted that he leave Iran, as it was not safe anymore. Nasrallah fled to Kurdistan and then left for Damascus. He set foot in the Syrian capital in February 1999.  Return to Iraq  In March 2003, just before Baghdad fell, Nasrallah returned to Iraq. Upon his return, he was assigned as the director for the public relations office of Sadiq al-Shirazi, which operates in the Ibn Fahad seminary, in Karbala.  Samarra expedition  Three days after the 2006 bombing, Nasrallah organised a protest in Karbala condemning the bombing of the al-Askari shrine. Three thousand people joined in the protest, and from there they decided to go to Samarra. However upon reaching Latifiya, they were stopped by troops from both the US and Iraqi army. As much as Nasrallah insisted they let them through, they were denied. In the end, he was connected to Nouri al-Maliki's personal assistant, who made it clear to Nasrallah that it was impossible for the troops to allow them to proceed for a number of reasons. Despite Nasrallah's countless attempts at convincing al-Maliki's assistant that all they wanted to do was go and protect the shrine from any further potential danger, they were denied. These sentiments were shared by the vast majority of Iraqis, who wanted their country to remain whole and free of ethnic conflict. After that, Samarra remained untouched, with very little development to return it to its old state. It was slowly fading away and considered a bygone by the majority of the Shias. This was because many of them were either scared of going, or simply avoiding to even think about it since they feared to go. However, Nasrallah was uncomfortable with this and felt he needed to revive the case. He organised another protest in Bayn al- Haramayn, this time demanding the reconstruction of the al-Askari shrine. The protest lasted for three days, however the response was relatively weak. So he consulted al-Shirazi‚Äìhis spiritual leader‚Äìand was granted religious permission to go to Samarra, adding that this will be considered a \\"religious crusade\\" and their deaths will be considered martyrdom. Nasrallah took heed of this, and announced that on eve of the martyrdom anniversary of Hasan al-Askari, i.e. March 16, 2008, they will be heading to Balad, as the closest point to Samarra, and hold a mourning procession there. At first, he struggled to find any coaches with drivers that we're willing to take them. So he reached out to some friends of his in Shatra, who were able to provide him with two coaches. He then contacted a friend of his in the special operations forces, Col. Sadiq al-Fatlawi, to help and escort them throughout the way, however al-Fatlawi strongly advised against the trip, and described it as a 'death-wish', and that they would be 'finished' at the first checkpoint. Nasrallah explained that they were only going to Balad (which was 45 kilometres away from Samarra), and not Samarra, but this still did not convince al-Fatlawi, and he remained in disagreement. Despite this, the next morning, Nasrallah called al- Fatlawi, and informed him that they were coming regardless, and this caused al-Fatlawi to eventually agree on escorting them to Balad. Nasrallah reached Balad in the evening of March 16, and was welcomed greatly by its people and heads, who were overwhelmed, since they had not seen any visitors for more than two years, i.e. since the bombings of the shrine. Nasrallah and his convoy spent the night in Balad mourning the martyrdom anniversary of al- Askari in the Sayid Muhammad shrine. After the procession, Nasrallah decided to unveil his true intentions to his group, which was he was planning to make his way to Samarra. To his joy, everyone was more than willing to join him. The following morning, the heads of Balad approached Nasrallah, and wanted to show their gratitude by asking him for any request. Nasrallah responded with a call pf support for his trip to Samarra, as they were more familiar with the way and situation. The people were shocked, and refused, saying that they would not want to thank them by sending them to their deaths. However, Nasrallah had no interest in backing down, so he remained persistent. He sent a first batch in front to test the way and see if the route was safe until the first checkpoint. When that batch returned, it reported that it was turned away by the first checkpoint, where they met the governor of Saladin, Hamad al-Qaysi, who explained that it was too dangerous. Nasrallah did not care for this and decided to set off, and before he left Balad, he made a call to one of the leaders of the city, and pleaded for their support, yet they declined. Ten minutes later, he made one last call, this time using a more shaming tone, and uttered \\"remember this very well, remember that the Imams called for your aid, and you refused them, remember how you betrayed and shamed your religion, and this will follow for your coming generations, and I will stand and call you out on the day of Judgement.\\" It seemed that this speech of his had moved them, and so they decided to follow. They came with forty cars, civilian and military. They spent the way receiving random gunfire coming from undisclosed locations, until they safely reached the al-Askari shrine. It was overwhelming and an emotional scene for them all, as they saw the dome of one of their most adhered figures, demolished, along with all of the debris. Nasrallah and the convoy performed a mourning procession there, and then later spoke to the military men, who uncovered that the al-Maliki had planned to contract a Turkish company to lift all the debris in three years, and a reconstruct the shrine in fifteen years. Nasrallah was very unhappy with the plans and progress, so he contacted the higher religious authority in Najaf, i.e. Ayatollah Sistani's office, demanding a better plan, so al-Sistani sent Muhammad-Ali al-Shahristani to liaise. Nasrallah made five demands to the government, that needed to be addressed if they wanted them to leave, they were: # Samarra is to be released from the political sphere and made a religious case only. # The contract between the Iraqi government and Turkish company be terminated, and new one be formed strictly with an Iraqi company. # UNESCO's involvement be limited to only observation, and no interference in the al-Askari shrine. # The significant increase of military presence placed in order to protect the shrines. # The way to Samarra be secured enough, so that pilgrims can comfortably make visitation at any time during the year. Nasrallah wanted to do some work to deal with the debris, but he was not allowed, and the special operations forces commander said that letting them in itself was going to get them in a lot of trouble, and that they can not let them do anything else. Nasrallah also introduced the idea of dedicating the last Friday of Ramadan as the national day to support al-Askariyayn (Hasan al- Askari and Ali al-Hadi). Inspired by Mirza Shirazi and his revitalisation and re-centralisation of Samarra, Nasrallah aims to return the city to its prior academic status and become a centre for teaching and training those seeking Islamic sciences and knowledge taught by the Ahl al-Bayt, especially since it took a halt after the death of Shirazi. He plans to do so by working on establishing religious and cultural centres. This includes Husayniyat al- Rasool al-Adam, which he is personally funding and supervising.  Activism  Nasrallah hosts an annual protest, in Arar, near the Iraqi-Saudi border, condemning the demolition of the al-Baqi' cemetery, and demanding the Saudi government to rebuild the graves of the prominent Islamic figures buried there. He also called for the legislation of a vatican-like vicinity to be made for the city of Karbala, with its own holy laws that will prevent the violation of the sanctity of the city. In Syria, after the civil war set off, he took the first mourning delegation to visit the Sayeda Zainab shrine, and helped many Afghans that lived in Damascus, relocate to Karbala.  Philanthropy  Nasrallah sponsors a number of charitable initiatives in Iraq, some of them include: * The Fatima al-Zahra Charitable Foundation in Iraq, which distributes financial aid to newly weds that are struggling financially in Karbala. * The Grand Hussaini Project, which annually provides multiple services (such as accommodation, food and drink, etc.) for free to the public, during the Arbaeen pilgrimage. * Al-Rahiq al-Makhtoom campaign that saw the distribution of food bags to underwhelmed families in face of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Personal life  Nasrallah is married and has seven children. His son Muhammad-Mehdi was killed in an explosion on June 6, 2016, in Karbala. The attack was claimed by ISIS, and was initially targeting Nasrallah. An annual football tournament was set up in honour of Muhammad-Mehdi by the Youth and Sport Welfare Authority in the Imam Husayn Shrine. Karbala's city council also renamed the road in which the explosion took place in to al-Shahid Muhammad Aref Nasrallah () Road. Nasrallah is a close friend of Kuwaiti MP, Saleh Ashour.

Biography Jackson was born in 1947 and grew up in central Kingston. His uncle was a well-known musician, Luther Williams, whose sister Mavis gave Jackson piano lessons. He attended a music school, and started playing bass after seeing Lloyd Brevett play with the Skatalites. He was also influenced by Motown records, particularly the bass playing of James Jamerson. He joined his first band, Ty and the Titans, after the existing bassist left. After two years with the band, he joined the Cavaliers, led by Lester Sterling. When the Skatalites broke up, Jackson was approached by saxophonist Tommy McCook, who was forming a new band, the Supersonics. Jackson joined McCook's band, and remained with them for five years.

The record's success meant that Jackson became in great demand for sessions at Reid's Treasure Isle recording studio, directed by McCook and often playing alongside guitarists Lynn Taitt and Hux Brown, keyboard players Gladstone Anderson and Winston Wright, and drummer Winston Grennan. Jackson was a mainstay of rocksteady music, and started working with other producers including Leslie Kong, Joe Gibbs, and Lloyd Daley, but after a short break also continued working for Reid, where the band was known as the Supersonics. \\"The Giants: Jackie Jackson\\", Jamaica Observer, 6 August 2016.

What is Virtual Reality?: Everything You Wanted to Know Featuring Exclusive Interviews With the Leaders of the VR Industry. (pages 46-50) Amazon/Kindle. Williams co-developed the concept of PRE-ality while working with emergency room doctors and physical therapists. PRE-ality (a portmanteau combining ‚Äúprepare‚Äù and ‚Äúreality‚Äù) uses virtual reality cinema to evoke an erroneous sense of d√©j√† vu in the viewer to better prepare them for a reality they have yet to visit. This discovery led to the implementation of a first-of-its-kind virtual reality training experience for healthcare education. Williams' narrative research emphasizes collaboration between storytellers and their audience. Williams developed two unique concepts ‚Äì the triangle of knowledge and the screenwriters taxonomy ‚Äì over the course of ten years, publishing books about both in 2017. The following year, Williams co-wrote and co- directed a feature-length narrative virtual reality project. The project has since been proven to increase cultural self-efficacy in the audience. Williams subsequently co-wrote a book explaining ways to use virtual reality cinema (cine-VR) to engage and influence the audience.  Education and Career  Williams earned his MFA in Film from Columbia University, directing the feature film Snakes and Arrows as his thesis. He later wrote a Columbo made- for-TV movie for Universal Studios and developed a pilot program for American Movie Classics called Don‚Äôt Try This At Home.

It was affiliated with the African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.) Church. In its final years, the early 1960s, it enrolled three hundred students. Founded in Vicksburg in 1890, it moved to Jackson in 1898. Perry W. Howard served as its president from 1899 until 1900. M. M. Ponton became president of the college in 1907. On April 8, 1960, Black civil rights activist Medgar Evers announced the Easter boycott of downtown Jackson merchants from a press conference at the college. Charles A. Jones, Campbell College's dean of religion, led the boycott campaign. Robert M. Stevens was then president of the college. In October 1961, students from Burglund High School marched through downtown McComb in solidarity with Brenda Travis, a fifteen-year-old student who had been arrested and sentenced for participating in a voter registration drive and sit-ins. Around 1600 students were arrested as they prayed on the steps of City Hall. Berglund's principal required students to sign a pledge to avoid participation in further protests in order to attend school. In response, Campbell College offered Berglund students who refused an opportunity to enroll. The Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission monitored Campbell College's civil rights activities, placing its president Robert Stevens and dean of religion Charles Jones on its \\"trouble-makers list.\\" In February 1962, conservative members of the college's Board of Trustees and the AME Church filed for injunction to remove Stevens, Jones, and other administrators from their duties. The Chancery Court allowed the Board of Trustees to be reconstituted, but the new board reinstated Steven and Jones four months later. Civil rights activism continued on campus after 1962, but the college and its sponsor the Eighth Episcopal District lost money in the process, as well as in a separate land transaction. In 1964, the state of Mississippi seized the college by eminent domain. Scholar Jay Ann Williamson wrote that, \\"Legislators never called it an act of retribution, but Campbell's place in the Jackson movement clearly influenced the decision.\\" Williamson stated that \\"The demise of Campbell College provides an extreme example of private HBCU Historically Black Colleges and Universities vulnerability to state attempts to quash the Civil Rights Movement.\\" References External links  * A 1908 ‚Äì 1909 college catalogue is available online from Emory University.

Samuel Laing Williams (January 10, 1857 ‚Äì December 21, 1921) was the first African American to graduate from the Law School of the George Washington University, then called Columbian University, in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1821 as Columbian College, Columbian University briefly admitted African Americans to its law program some time between 1865 and about 1890. Williams may have been the first African American admitted to any GW program when he applied in 1882; he experienced discrimination from his white peers but was said to have eventually won their respect, along with that of the faculty, who awarded him a top law thesis prize. He earned his LL.B. from Columbian University in 1884 while also working at the United States Pension office. He was admitted to the District of Columbia Bar on June 18, 1885, then went on to earn his LL.M. from Columbian University's graduate law program in 1885. Out of a student body of just over 180 law students, only three other African Americans are known to have attended Columbian University Law School during this time: Robert Bruce Bagby from Indiana, Theodore H. Greene from Mississippi, and George Langhorne Pryor from Virginia, who were all enrolled as seniors in 1886. At least one other African American, William Henry Harrison Hart, is known to have been rejected admission in 1885. This window of admissions of African Americans soon closed, and George Washington University did not drop its racial exclusion policies until 1954, after George Washington University Law School merged with National University Law School, which had already desegregated. Biography Williams was born in Savannah, Georgia, between 1854 and 1859, the child of an African-American woman known only as Nancy, and an unknown white Englishman. One obituary gives his birth date as January 10, 1857. Little is known of his early life, but by 1870, he was living in Chicago with David and Ann Laing, both from England; listed on the census as \\"Samuel Williams\\" (he included the name \\"Laing\\" later), he moved with them to Columbiaville, Michigan, where David Laing opened an iron foundry. Williams enrolled in the University of Michigan in 1877 and graduated in 1881 with an A.B. degree. For a short time, he moved to Greensboro, Alabama, to teach in the Tullibody Academy, a private school for African-American boys. He then moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked as an adjudicator in the United States Pension Office, and soon after, entered Columbian University Law School. While in law school, he met Frances \\"Fannie\\" Barrier (1855‚Äì1944), an African-American teacher then in Washington, D.C., who went on to work as a social activist, clubwoman, lecturer, and journalist working for social justice, civil liberties, education, and employment opportunities, especially for black women. Williams moved back to Chicago in 1885, but continued to visit Barrier in Washington. The two were married at her parents' home in Brockport, New York, on April 20, 1887, celebrated with receptions in Washington, and then moved to Chicago, where they became leaders in the African-American community. They were friends and associates of black activists representing a range of ideologies, including Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington, and with white reformers, including Jane Addams, Mary McDowell, and Philip D. Armour, whom they convinced to fund the founding of Provident Hospital, which had a bi-racial staff and clientele and a nursing school for African Americans. Williams worked as a lawyer for the Chicago NAACP and served as its Vice President in 1914. He served as Assistant U.S. District Attorney in Chicago during the Roosevelt and Taft administrations, and was one of the best known African-American lawyers in the country and regarded by many as a brilliant orator.

About 100 Dalit houses have been burned down by a mob of 200 villagers and Dalits who attempted to escape were attacked, including the reports of sexual assaults against Dalit women. The attacks lasted for 2 hours and 14 people were seriously injured in the violence including a man's arm reportedly hacked off. Tensions reportedly started after Dalits in the village boycotted the 2004 Lok Sabha election as a protest because some of their grievances remained unattended. This is said to have angered the upper caste villagers and also the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers when the dalits remained unconcerned during the BJP general secretary's visit to the village. Other incidents include an attack against a Dalit youth who was pasting posters to celebrate Dr. Ambedkar's birthday and an altercation between Dalit youths and the upper- caste men in an auto-rickshaw. The attacks started after the loss of BJP's state general secretary in the polls. The United states Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor reported that the attackers blamed the loss of their candidate on the Dalits. Several Dalit leaders and political parties blamed the BJP for the violence.  Background  The village of Kalapatti is situated in the district of Coimbatore, the village comprised 2,000 families of the Gounder caste, the politically and economically powerful caste in the village. The Dalit settlement comprised 250 families belonging to the Arunthathiyar caste, 10 families of the Parayar caste and 150 families of the Boyar caste.  Caste discrimination  The World Organisation Against Torture reported the members of the Dalit community in the village were not allowed to walk in the streets belonging to the upper caste members, not allowed entry inside the village Mariamman temple and were not allowed to walk in the streets talking among themselves. Casteist slurs and intimidation were often used against the Dalits and they were forced to lower their heads in public to punctuate their lower status. Dalit women were often subjected to sexual assaults and harassment. Dalits also had to use separate glasses in tea shops.  Election boycott  During the 2004 Indian general election, the Dalits in the village announced that they would boycott the elections as a protest because many of their problems remained unconsidered. One of their key demands of the Dalit community is their entry into the common village temple which had been opposed by caste-Hindus for years. Nothing could be done about it by the State Government or Sangh Parivar, which exerted significant influence over the Dalits in the region. However, the Dalits were resistant on their resolution to boycott the polls. It is reported that when the Bharatiya Janata Party's state president visited the village, the Dalits remained unconcerned which angered the BJP cadres. The local upper caste members were also opposed to the boycott decision of the Dalit community. The BJP candidate C.P Radhakrishnan lost the polls to K Subbarayan of the Communist party of India.  Incidents preceding the violence  A Dalit youth was attacked on 14 May by some men from the Gounder caste when he was pasting posters to celebrate the birthday of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar. On 15 May, a group of Dalit youth who traveled with a group of Gounder men in an auto rickshaw were allegedly verbally abused them in derogatory words because the Dalit youth were enjoying themselves in front of the upper caste men and slapped one of them after getting out of the rickshaw. The Dalit youth who went to the Kovilpalayam Police to complaint about the incident but the police men took no action and allegedly told the youth to leave out statements mentioning the use of derogatory language by the attackers but when the Dalit youth included everything in the complaint, the police did not register the complaint. Although, this incident was believed to be the immediate cause for the assault, the underlying cause is assumed to be the growing fear of the development of Dalits in the village due to the active position played by certain Dalit organisations.  Attacks  The attack occurred on 16 May 2004 within the fortnight of the elections in the Dalit localities of New Colony and Shastri Nagar in the Kalapatti village by 200 upper-caste villagers, armed with swords, iron rods and other weapons. They ransacked about 100 homes and damaged the household items and television sets. When the Dalits ran for their safety, they were attacked with sickles, iron rods, long sticks and knives. The attacks lasted for two hours and 14 people including a 75 year old man were seriously injured and were hospitalized. Several women were allegedly sexually assaulted and the attackers used derogatory language against them during the attacks. The attackers also set fire to cattle sheds, bikes and the Dalit temples, a man's hand was cut off during the attack. It is reported that 100 homes were completely burned and were razed to the ground, some of the attackers molested the Dalit women and also looted jewelry and money from the houses. As per the 2005 annual report of United Nations special rapporteur on Racism, the upper caste villagers forced the Dalits to the ground and stomped on them using derogatory caste terms against them. The saris of the Dalit women were stripped off. In other cases, an 8-month-old infant was thrown against a wall, a 75-year-old man was assaulted, and a middle-aged woman was struck in her head while she attempted to defend her son. Almost 100 homes were burned down and cattle belonging to the Dalits were also killed. The offices of the Adhi Thamizhar Viduthalai Munnani were among the places attacked. A photo of the B.R. Ambedkar is reported to have been burned down. University and School certificates and land pattas have been burnt according to the reports of a number of fact-finding committees, such as the People's Watch-Tamil Nadu, the Tamil Nadu Division of the People's Congress for Civil Liberties and the Dalit Human Rights Monitoring. As per the reports of these teams, the attackers had not even spared the cattle belonging to the Dalit people. Many Dalits of the village of Kalapatti escaped to neighboring villages out of fear. The Government allotted ‚Çπ 20 lakh for relief work to the Dalits, but only ‚Çπ 2,42,000 was granted as immediate remuneration. Despite this, there were reports that the Dalits have been forced by the police to conceal the burning items and are trying to mitigate the extent of the atrocities.  Arrests  The cops detained 54 people and filed cases on them under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act on Atrocities and Indian Penal Code. The research teams, argued that the police appeared on the scene only after 2.5 hours after the attack, while the closest police station is inside 7 kilo-meters of the village but some Dalit youths had made complaints to the police when the mob was on the attack.  Investigations  The United states Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor reported that the violence was because the Upper caste members blamed the Dalits for the loss of their candidate. The local villagers alleged that C.P Radhakrishnan, the then general secretary of the BJP threatened to \\"deal with them later\\" for boycotting the elections. Dalit leader, Thol. Thirumavalavan, who visited the village after the violence, accused the Bharatiya Janata Party for the violence. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Communist Party of India (CPI) members also accused the BJP and called for the arrest of all those implicated in the crime and the payment of compensations to those affected in the attacks. Hindutva factions have been using Arunthathiyar youngsters to commit violent activities in and outside of Coimbatore until the attacks. Dalit leaders said the tragedy only demonstrates that the Sangh Parivar, which is evidently continuing to lose its grip on the Arunthathiyars, as indicated by the choice of the Dalits to boycott the polls in which the BJP tried to preserve its seat.

In December 2017 Rev. Anselm I. Nwaorgu, the pastor of Blessed Sacrament, cited the low enrollment and asked the Newark Archdiocese to allow him to close Blessed Sacrament School. The school was to close in June of that year. A charter school was scheduled to occupy its space; charter schools had been asking the church for information on its school space prior to the closure. Former Academic director Alice Terrell stated that the drop in enrollment and closure resulted from an increase in charter schools. * Our Lady of Good Counsel School - Closed in 2005. * Queen of Angels School - It was in the Central Ward and belonged to a church, established in 1930, that was the city's first church catering to African-Americans.

By 1998 the St. Patrick building served as the upper school, another building was used as a lower school, and a separate building was used for the office of its director. Elizabethport Catholic's initial projected enrollment was 500; the combined enrollment meant that the school could have classes for high-level students, athletic programs, and after school programs, things lacking in the predecessor schools.

The ride occurred on the night of April 18, 1775, immediately before the battles of Lexington and Concord, the first engagements of the American Revolutionary War. In the preceding weeks, British Army activity indicated a planned crackdown on the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, then based in Concord. Paul Revere and William Dawes prepared the alert, which began when Robert Newman, sexton of Boston's North Church, used a lantern signal to alert colonists in Charlestown to the Army's advance by way of the Charles River. Revere and Dawes then rode to meet John Hancock and Samuel Adams in Lexington, alerting up to 40 other riders along the way. Revere and Dawes then headed towards Concord with Samuel Prescott. The three were captured by British troops in Lincoln. Prescott and Dawes escaped but Revere was returned to Lexington and freed after questioning. By giving the Colonists advance warning of the British Army's actions, the ride played a crucial role in the Colonists' victory in the subsequent battles. The ride has been commemorated in a range of cultural depictions, most notably Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 1861 poem, \\"Paul Revere's Ride\\", which has shaped popular memory of the event. Background When British Army activity on April 7, 1775, suggested the possibility of troop movements, Joseph Warren sent Revere to warn the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, then sitting in Concord, the site of one of the larger caches of Patriot military supplies. After receiving the warning, Concord residents began moving the military supplies away from the town. One week later, on April 14, General Gage received instructions from Secretary of State William Legge, Earl of Dartmouth (dispatched on January 27), to disarm the rebels, who were known to have hidden weapons in Concord, among other locations, and to imprison the rebellion's leaders, especially Samuel Adams and John Hancock. Dartmouth gave Gage considerable discretion in his commands. Gage issued orders to Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith to proceed from Boston \\"with utmost expedition and secrecy to Concord, where you will seize and destroy... all Military stores.... But you will take care that the soldiers do not plunder the inhabitants or hurt private property.\\" Gage did not issue written orders for the arrest of rebel leaders, as he feared doing so might spark an uprising. Paul Revere landing site marker, Charlestown waterfront Between 9 and 10 p.m. on the night of April 18, 1775, Joseph Warren told Revere and William Dawes that the king's troops were about to embark in boats from Boston bound for Cambridge and the road to Lexington and Concord. Warren's intelligence suggested that the most likely objectives of the regulars' movements later that night would be the capture of Adams and Hancock. They did not worry about the possibility of regulars marching to Concord, since the supplies at Concord were safe, but they did think their leaders in Lexington were unaware of the potential danger that night. Revere and Dawes were sent out to warn them and to alert colonial militias in nearby towns. Events=Preparation In the days before April 18, Revere had instructed Robert Newman, the sexton of the North Church, to send a signal by lantern to alert colonists in Charlestown as to the movements of the troops when the information became known. In what is well known today by the phrase \\"one if by land, two if by sea\\", one lantern in the steeple would signal the army's choice of the land route while two lanterns would signal the route \\"by water\\" across the Charles River (the movements would ultimately take the water route, and therefore two lanterns were placed in the steeple). Revere first gave instructions to send the signal to Charlestown. He then crossed the Charles River by rowboat, slipping past the British warship HMS Somerset at anchor. Crossings were banned at that hour, but Revere safely landed in Charlestown and rode to Lexington, avoiding a British patrol and later warning almost every house along the route. The Charlestown colonists dispatched additional riders to the north. Ride Riding through present-day Somerville, Medford, and Arlington, Revere warned patriots along his route, many of whom set out on horseback to deliver warnings of their own. By the end of the night there were probably as many as 40 riders throughout Middlesex County carrying the news of the army's advance. Revere did not shout the phrase later attributed to him (\\"The British are coming!\\"): his mission depended on secrecy, the countryside was filled with British army patrols, and most of the Massachusetts colonists (who were predominantly English in ethnic origin)According to the 1790 census, Massachusetts was 89% English, Scots, and Northern Irish. still considered themselves British. Revere's warning, according to eyewitness accounts of the ride and Revere's own descriptions, was \\"The Regulars are coming out.\\" Revere arrived in Lexington around midnight, with Dawes arriving about a half-hour later. They met with Samuel Adams and John Hancock, who were spending the night with Hancock's relatives (in what is now called the Hancock‚ÄìClarke House), and they spent a great deal of time discussing plans of action upon receiving the news. They believed that the forces leaving the city were too large for the sole task of arresting two men and that Concord was the main target. The Lexington men dispatched riders to the surrounding towns, and Revere and Dawes continued along the road to Concord accompanied by Samuel Prescott, a doctor who happened to be in Lexington \\"returning from a lady friend's house at the awkward hour of 1 a.m.\\" The ride of the three men triggered a flexible system of \\"alarm and muster\\" that had been carefully developed months before, in reaction to the colonists' impotent response to the Powder Alarm of September 1774. This system was an improved version of an old network of widespread notification and fast deployment of local militia forces in times of emergency. The colonists had periodically used this system all the way back to the early years of Indian wars in the colony, before it fell into disuse in the French and Indian War. In addition to other express riders delivering messages, bells, drums, alarm guns, bonfires, and a trumpet were used for rapid communication from town to town, notifying the rebels in dozens of eastern Massachusetts villages that they should muster their militias because the regulars in numbers greater than 500 were leaving Boston with possible hostile intentions. This system was so effective that people in towns from Boston were aware of the army's movements while they were still unloading boats in Cambridge. Unlike in the Powder Alarm, the alarm raised by the three riders successfully allowed the militia to confront the British troops in Concord, and then harry them all the way back to Boston. Capture Revere, Dawes, and Prescott were detained by a British Army patrol in Lincoln at a roadblock on the way to Concord. Prescott jumped his horse over a wall and escaped into the woods; he eventually reached Concord. Dawes also escaped, though he fell off his horse not long after and did not complete the ride. The equestrian statue of Paul Revere in North End, Boston by Cyrus Dallin was unveiled on September 22, 1940. Revere was captured and questioned by the British soldiers at gunpoint. He told them of the army's movement from Boston, and that British army troops would be in some danger if they approached Lexington, because of the large number of hostile militia gathered there. He and other captives taken by the patrol were still escorted east toward Lexington, until about a half mile from Lexington they heard a gunshot. The British major demanded Revere explain the gunfire, and Revere replied it was a signal to \\"alarm the country\\". As the group drew closer to Lexington, the town bell began to clang rapidly, upon which one of the captives proclaimed to the British soldiers: \\"The bell's a'ringing! The town's alarmed, and you're all dead men!\\" The British soldiers gathered and decided not to press further towards Lexington but instead to free the prisoners and head back to warn their commanders. The British confiscated Revere's horse and rode off to warn the approaching army column. Revere walked to Rev. Jonas Clarke's house, where Hancock and Adams were staying. As the battle on Lexington Green unfolded, Revere assisted Hancock and his family in their escape from Lexington, helping to carry a trunk of Hancock's papers. Legacy=Longfellow's poem Revere on 1958 U.S. stamp. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow popularized Paul Revere in \\"Paul Revere's Ride\\", a poem first published in 1861, over 40 years after Revere's death, and reprinted in 1863 as part of Tales of a Wayside Inn. The poem opens: Longfellow's poem is not historically accurate, but the inaccuracies were deliberate. Longfellow had researched the historical event, using such works as George Bancroft's History of the United States, but he changed the facts for poetic effect. The poem was one of a series in which he sought to create American legends; earlier examples include The Song of Hiawatha (1855) and The Courtship of Miles Standish (1858). Longfellow was successful in creating a legend: Revere's stature rose significantly in the years following the poem's publication. Parts of the ride route in Massachusetts are now posted with signs marked \\"Revere's Ride\\". The route follows Main Street in Charlestown, Broadway and Main Street in Somerville, Main Street and High Street in Medford, Medford Street to Arlington center, and Massachusetts Avenue the rest of the way through Lexington and into Lincoln. Revere's ride is reenacted annually. Contrary to popular belief, Revere and Dawes were not the only riders; however, they were the only two to be noted in the poem. Samuel Prescott and Israel Bissell were also tasked to undertake the mission, Bissell being the person to ride the farthest distance of all. Music The rock group Paul Revere and the Raiders had considerable popularity from the mid-1960s through the early-1970s. The band's namesake and organist was born Paul Revere Dick, named after Revere. The song \\"Me and Paul Revere\\", written by musician Steve Martin and performed with his bluegrass group Steve Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers, was inspired by the tale of Paul Revere's ride and told from the point of view of Revere's horse, Brown Beauty. ReferencesBibliography  This work is extensively footnoted, and contains a voluminous list of primary resources concerning all aspects of the Revere's ride and the battles at Lexington and Concord.

Jaroslav fought at the Battle of France. Later, he operated as a member of Platinum- Pewter, a military-intelligence parachute platoon, across the Nazi-occupied Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, today's Czech Republic. One of his platoon colleagues was Jaroslav Klemes, one of the longest-living and best- known Czechoslovakian World War II veterans.  Youth  Jaroslav was born on January 28, 1912 in Kl√°≈°ter Hradi≈°tƒõ nad Jizerou. His father Emil was a shoemaker and farmer by occupation. His mother Gabriela, born as Macharovsk√°, was a homemaker. Jaroslav had seven siblings. Jaroslav attended a vocational brewer training. Subsequently, he worked as a brewer up until the beginning of his military service in 1933. Although he started military service in Mlad√° Boleslav, he reallocated to Prague's infantry regiment after completing basic training. As Jaroslav finished the military service, he returned to his brewing occupation. In 1938 Jaroslav shifted to a sommelier position.  In Exile  In October 1939, Jaroslav headed to France. However, to be able to do so, Jaroslav had to walk across Slovakia, Hungary, the rest of the Balkans, Turkey, and Syria. From Syria, he sailed to France. When finally in France, Jaroslav reported to the foreign section of the Czechoslovakian Army. On January 4, 1940, in Agde, he was assigned to the 1. infantry regiment of the Czechoslovakian Army. While Jaroslav was part of this regiment, he fought in the Battle of France. After the fall of France, Jaroslav evacuated to the United Kingdom. In the UK, Jaroslav joined the 1. infantry battalion. On December 1, 1940, he passed driving tests and was promoted to Gefreiter, a second rank. Between February 21 and March 27, 1942, Jaroslav passed sabotage and parachuting courses. From October 26 to July 1942, Jaroslav completed courses focused on industrial sabotage, receipt of aircraft, civilian employment, conspiracy, and further aspects of parachuting. During this period, Jaroslav was promoted to a corporal rank and became a member of the platoon Pewter and later the Platinum-Pewter. In August 1944, Jaroslav moved to a station in Bari, Italy, where he was waiting for further orders.  Deployment  Jaroslav was deployed as a paratrooper in the area of Nasavrky on February 17, 1945. Along with his partners from Platinum-Pewter, Jaroslav begun executing orders related to military intelligence and also the organization and receipts of secret air shipments. He executed most of these actions in the area of the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands.  After WWII  On May 8, 1945, Jaroslav was promoted to a second lieutenant. During the same year, he married and had two children. Continuously, Jaroslav worked his way up to the rank of senior lieutenant of infantry. During this period, Jaroslav worked across various military positions, including the commander of the 71st parachute battalion's paratrooper school or at the Grande Prague's headquarters. On October 23, 1948, Jaroslav was promoted to the captain of infantry. He served as the chief of a military garrison at Mimo≈à. Soon, he was promoted to the staff captain rank. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia seized power during 1948. For political purposes, numerous World War II veterans were dismissed from the military service. Jaroslav was dismissed on August 31, 1951. He was not given any justification for the dismissal. Contrariwise, the party banned Jaroslav from obtaining any employment other than in the heavy industry, mining, or agriculture. Additionally, Jaroslav and his family, including his two young children, were given 24 hours to abandon their home. The government took their property without offering any compensation. Later on, Jaroslav was able to obtain employment as a construction worker and then as a driver. After eight years, in 1959, Jaroslav was permitted to start working within the Veterinary Research Institute in Brno. Jaroslav died on August 11, 1972. In 1992, the Czech government recognized Jaroslav's contribution to anti-Nazi resistance. In memoriam, Jaroslav was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel of infantry and received several awards and recognitions. In 1995, he was also given a memorial plate publicly displayed in a proximity of the brewery in Hradi≈°tƒõ nad Jizero. His son is Jaroslav Pe≈°√°n,a veterinary and politician. The son was a member of the Parliament's lower house, the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic. He represented the ODS.

It measures in height and depicts a shaman kneeling with a gourd rattle in one hand and a snake or snakeskin wrapped around his neck.

It affiliated to the General German Trade Union Confederation (ADGB), and by 1920 had 363,521 members. On 29 May 1921, the Workers' Union of the Book and Newspaper Industry also joined the ZdA, while the German Union of Lawyers and Notaries joined in 1922. In 1921, the ZdA became a founding constituent of the General Federation of Free Employees, leaving the AGDB, but remaining aligned with it through the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). In the same year, it was a founding affiliate of the International Federation of Commercial, Clerical, Professional and Technical Employees (FIET), and its joint leader became the first leader of FIET. The union published Der freie Angestellte, initially edited by Paul Lange, and from 1930 by Georg Ucko. In its early years, the union was divided between the leadership, generally SPD supporters, and the \\"Berlin Opposition\\", an alliance of Communist Party of Germany and Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany supporters.

Design and development Renault 100 hp engine, side view Renault 100 hp engine, front view The Renault 100 hp V-12 engine was development from an earlier 90 hp Renault V-12. The main change was the increased bore size of 96 mm instead of 90 mm in the 90 hp engine. Otherwise the general design of the engine was left relatively unchanged, and like its predecessor its general construction was derivative of the air-cooled Renault V-8 engines of the time, such as the 60 hp V-8 type. The V-12 engine had its two rows of cylinders angled at 60 degree to each other and had a cylinder bore of 96 mm and a stroke of 140 mm. The cylinders and cylinder heads were separate cast-iron pieces with cast fins for air-cooling. The cylinder head was tightened to the cylinder with a copper- asbestos washer, and then secured by a cross-shaped clamp which was bolted to the crankcase with four long studs.Angle 1921, p. 414 Airflow for cooling the cylinders was generated with a fan driven from the rear end of the crankshaft. The fan was blowing air into the sheet metal enclosed chamber between the two rows of cylinders, which then left the enclosure through the narrow spaces between the cylinders, passing through the cylinder's cooling-fins. A single camshaft was situated between the two rows of cylinders and operates the inlet and exhaust valves of both cylinder rows, with each valve operated by a separate cam on the camshaft. The inlet and exhaust valves sat vertically opposed in a lateral pocket of the cylinder head on the side of the combustion chamber, with the inlet valve situated below the exhaust valve. The inlet valve was operated directly from the camshaft via a tappet, whereas the exhaust valve was operated via a push rod and a rocker lever. The propeller was mounted directly on the camshaft, which was driven from the crankshaft via reduction gearing consisting of spur gears. The lower part of the crankcase served as an oil reservoir. A pressurized oil lubrication system was fed by a gear pump located on the lowest point of the crankcase. The oil pump was driven over a vertical shaft from the camshaft via helical gears.Vorreiter 1914, p. 82 The crankshaft was supported by five plain intermediate bearings and two outer ball bearings. Contrary to their V-8 predecessors, the V-12 engines had master-and-slave connecting rods instead of the side-by-side placement of the connecting rods on the same crank journal.L'Aviation et l'automobilisme militaires : revue mensuelle des progr√®s scientifiques appliqu√©s √† la D√©fense nationale, March 1914, pp. 71-73 This design feature was kept on the later Renault 80 hp V-8 and Renault 130 hp V-12 aircraft engines. The pistons were made of steel and were fitted with three cast iron rings. A dual carburetor was fitted on one side of the crankcase, with each barrel of the carburetor feeding one cylinder row. Ignition was supplied by two Bosch magnetos, with each magneto separately serving one cylinder row. The two magnetos were mounted transversely on the top of camshaft on the propeller end. The drive shafts of the magnetos were joined together and driven from the camshaft via helical gears. The engine was said to produce up to 110 hp at 1800 rpm.

Popularly known as \\"Priest of the Sinhala Cinema\\", Poruthota rendered a yeoman service to Sri Lanka's cinema industry and was the founder of Sri Lanka OCIC organization. Early life and education Poruthota was born on 31 August 1931 in Marawila, Puttalam as the eldest of the family. His father Poruthotage Jokinu Fernando from Boralessa was a teacher at the Government Teachers‚Äô College in Maggona before being transferred to Marawila. His father has also published several books such as Kayika Vidyawa, Saddharma Rathnavali Deepika, Sinhala Mosthara Nirmana and Iganweeme Mooladharma. He was also a painter. His mother Mary Margaret Peiris was from Seeduwa. Ernest has 3 younger sisters - Stella, Marilyn, Cristobal - and one younger brother, Earl. He received his primary education at the Marawila Roman Catholic School and then went to Francis Xavier English School in the village. Then he attended St. Aloysius Junior Church in Borella and St. Bernard's Church in Borella in 1942. He was later inducted into the National Diocese of Our Lady of Ampitiya, Kandy. On 2 February 1957, he was ordained by the Most Reverend Thomas Cardinal Cooray at St. Lucia Cathedral, Kotahena. From 1957 to 1959, he worked as a Pisces Father at St. Lucia Cathedral, Kotahena. Then he worked as a Pisces Father at St. Sebastian's College, Moratuwa from 1959‚Äì60 and later at St. Joseph of Pamunugama in 1960 and finally at Dehiwala St Mary's Church from 1960‚Äì62. Rev. Fr. Poruthota then became the pastor of several parishes including Dehiyagatha (1962‚Äì66), Kelaniya (1967‚Äì74), Kalutara Kalmulla (1974‚Äì82), Kotte (1982‚Äì87), Wattala (1991‚Äì97) and Dehiwala (1997-2004). In 1987, Poruthota was appointed as the Archbishop of Colombo until 1991. He was twice elected to the office of Archbishop of Colombo. He died on 16 June 2020 at the age of 88 while receiving treatment at a private hospital in Colombo. His body was kept at the Archbishop's House until 6:30 pm on Wednesday. His remains were then brought to St. Philip Mary Church, Katukurunda on 18 June 2020. The funeral took place at Roman Catholic Cemetery, Kalutara. Religious Services The Second Vatican Council, founded by Pope John XXIII in Vatican City in 1962, issued 16 ordinances in 1965, following the 1963, '64 and '65-year conferences. Father Poruthota was involved in conducting pilgrimages of Sri Lanka in Sinhala language instead of Latin. Therefore, he played an important role in instilling this new revolution into the Sri Lankan Catholic Church as well as the lay people. In 1963, he published the book Gihiya. It broadly commented on the Catholic lay, glory and power. Then he wrote the book Kithunu Peraliya, which analyzed in detail how the views of the Second Vatican discourse affect Sri Lanka. In 1958, while serving in the Kotahena Parish, he wrote the book Wurthiya samithi Viplawaya emphasizing the importance of the absence of trade union politics. In 1964, he wrote the social book Suraawa and then wrote Bhawyawadaya Saha Lankawa. The latter explained the impact of Jean-Paul Sartre's influence on the literature of the sixties. In 1965, Poruthota wrote two more books, Cardinal Cooray and Kri.Sha. Kramaya. In 1970, Pope Paul VI visited Sri Lanka and government asked Father Poruthota to write a book on Pope's visit. As a result, along with the Hon. Jayalath Balagalla, Poruthota launched 456-pages and 404-pages books with two-volumes titled Katholika Samaaja Dharshanaya. It is said that Father Poruthota was the first to bring Gokkola and wedding drums to the church in 1967 for a wedding reception which was held at the Bolawalana Church in Negombo. The Most Venerable Mapalagamagama Vipulasara Thero was a close friend of his, where Poruthota contributed to the Buddhism as well. Work on Cinema Since the early stages, Poruthota had a keen interest in cinema. He left the National Cathedral in 1957 with a broad knowledge of cinema by referring to the English textbook on cinema. He also brought \\"Sarasaviya\\" and \\"Visithura\\" cinema papers in every week. At the end of each year, he conserved them in his library using a thick wall. In 1965, he had published his book titled Chithrapati Gena. The Ceylon Film Critics and Writers Association was founded in 1967, with the guidance of Poruthota. He was also a member of the Arts Forum called Ape Kattiya. In 1970, Father Poruthota pioneered the establishment of the Sri Lankan branch of International Catholic Film Organization (OCIC) when he was a Kelaniya staff member. OCIC first meeting was held at St. Mary's Cathedral in Peliyagoda. He was appointed as the first National Director of the OCIC (later known as SIGNIS). Father Poruthota's objective was to establish a system of appreciating the talents of the artists representing the various sectors of local cinema which contributed to the development of good cinema. As a first step, a special ceremony was held to honor the Catholics who contributed to cinema from 1947 to 1972. The ceremony was held on 21 December 1971 with the participation of Cardinal Thomas Cooray, Archbishop of Colombo. In 1973, Ceylon Film and Critics and Writers Association began awarding critical awards to local cinema. On April 3, 1975, The National Catholic Cinema Cluster, which utilized the same platform, was awarded the Dharmasena Pathiraja's Ahas Gauwa award. With the guidance of Father Poruthota, a jury of films for the 1976 screening of the National Film Cinema Cluster at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute commenced on February 5, 1977, where Father Poruthota presided over this first jury. Since 1981, Father Poruthota took the initiative to present the awards for Sri Lankan Tamil films and short and semi-narratives. Then, the OCIC award was given to the best performers of the film industry in the year 1985 and the Jayavilal Wilegoda Memorial Award was held from 1986 onwards. He released the book 26 Weni Chithrapati Waarshikaya about the films of the year 1973. This was followed by separate books for the period 1947-1951 and period 1978‚Äì1982. However, The Catholic Cinema Cluster stopped publishing books with the 34th-35th film anniversary. At the request of the Catholic Church by the Rev.

The couple did not have children. He was for many years from 1698 until his death, a dean of the Guild. He bought off the obligation to perform the duties of the dean because he was very busy with his work. He paid the favour by paying money, offering wine and painting a portrait of Jan Karel Nicolaas van Hove, the mayor of Antwerp and headman of the painter's chamber of the Guild. He was very sought after as a teacher as evidenced by the fact that throughout his career he had a total of 35 pupils registered at the Guild. This also points to a large workshop. His pupils included Josephus Franciscus Brouwne, Frans Casteels (III), Cornelis van Dalen, Jan Baptist van Doren, Jan Carel Henry, Cornelis Joseph d'Heur, Adriaen van Os, Jacques Ignatius de Roore, Philip van de Santvoort, Philippus le Tombe and Karel Wuchters.

The city administration ordered a portrait of King Charles III in 1707. He was buried on 12 January 1717 in the Cathedral of Antwerp. His wife died on 17 March 1721. She left a large estate of which Karel Wuchters, her godson and nephew and pupil of her husband, inherited 500 guilders. Work Gaspar Jacob van Opstal is known for his paintings of portraits and biblical scenes. His father had been a copyist of the works of Rubens and had instilled in Gaspar an admiration for that Flemish artist which influenced his style and subject matter. He was known as a good colorist and had a free brush technique. He drew his figures very accurately and was able to depict their emotional state very well.

Shortly after its release, the Sudanese authorities confiscated and banned his books. In 2012, Baraka Sakin left Sudan, seeking exile in Austria, where he has lived since 2012. In 2016, his novel The Messiah of Darfur was published in a French translation, followed by Les Jango in 2020. In France, he also published children's books as a multilingual edition in Arabic, English and French. Several of his short stories have been published also in German translations. In September 2016, he was invited to the German capital Berlin as participant of its International Festival of Literature and in 2019 to the Festival of African Literature Crossing Borders in Cologne, Germany. Baraka Sakin has written for several Arabic-language magazines: Al Arabi Magazine (Kuweit), Al Naqid (London), Nazwa magazine (Oman), Journal of Palestinian Studies (Paris, in French), Doha Magazine (UAE), Banipal (London), or Dastoor Newspaper (London).

Her repertoire included Austrian and German composers but in particular Schumann, Brahms, Arnold Schoenberg and her own father.  Life  Stefan and Ola - Katherina Wolpe's parents in 1927 Wolpe was born in Grinzing within Vienna in 1931. Her parents were both Jews. They had married in 1927 but by the time Katherina was born they were living separately. Her father Stefan Wolpe was a composer, and her mother Ola (n√©e Okuniewska) was a painter born in Czechoslovakia. In 1938 she and her mother were trapped in Vienna but they managed to leave and then they walked to Serbia. Her father was long gone having left for Israel when Katherina was young. Her mother left her in Switzerland while she went to England to become an art teacher to make a living. Katherina found herself a de facto orphan in Berne during the war. By the time she arrived in London she was sixteen and a skilled pianist. She gave her first concert soon after her arrival. Her repertoire included Austrian and German composers like Haydn, Mozart, Schoenberg and Beethoven but in particular Schumann and Brahms. In 1951 her father wrote \\"Form for Piano\\" which he dedicated to his daughter. In 1991 she spent many hours recording all the music composed by Arnold Schoenberg. In 1997 she recorded an her performance of works by her father including \\"Piece of Embittered Music\\" from his Zemach Suite (1939), \\"Studies, Part 1\\" (1944-51) and \\"Form for Piano\\". It was called \\"Thinking Twice\\" after a series of lectures her had given. Her mother taught but she was a lifelong artist. She was religious and modest and she never exhibited her work. The work was linked to music and the house she and her mother shared would be visited by composers. There she would teach pianists and her mother taught painters. Wolpe died in Hampstead in 2013.

It was published in the US under the title The Rendezvous and Other Stories. Background The collection consists of 27 stories which, according to the book's first edition dust jacket, represent \\"all the stories which O'Brian wishes to preserve\\". All had previously appeared in one of his earlier collections The Last Pool (1950), The Walker (1953), Lying in the Sun (1956) and The Chian Wine (1974), and some had also been published individually. Dean King's 2000 biography includes comments on many of the stories, as do the two volumes of biography (2004 and 2019) by O'Brian's step- son Nikolai Tolstoy. Stories=\\"The Return\\" A man returns for a day's fishing to a favourite spot where, over the years, he had spent happy times with several female companions. He catches a handsome trout but as he looks down at its fine flesh and feels it bound and then lie still at his gentle touch, he feels a symbolism and cannot find it in his heart to kill it. Tolstoy notes that this story, completed in November 1939, was O'Brian's first venture into the description of man's relationship with nature. He praised the \\"delicate attention to detail and brilliant evocation of atmosphere.\\" \\"The Happy Despatch\\" A fisherman discovers a pot of gold during a fishing expedition, and meets his doom at the very moment of his escape with it. Tolstoy considered this story to be \\"unmistakably autobiographical\\", the protagonist being a man who, after failing in the British Army, has moved to a remote corner of Ireland where he finds himself unable to maintain a small farm; his poor judgement and lack of guile leads to a life of wretchedness which culminates in disaster. Tolstoy detects influences from Liam O'Flaherty's 1932 novel Skerrett. \\"The Dawn Flighting\\" A lone man has a poor morning's wildfowl shooting over the marsh. Depressed, he turns to start the long walk back, his mood changing to exhilaration as he appreciates the beauty of three wild swans flying high over his head. King noted that this story, written in 1940, \\"brilliantly evokes the sport of hunting\\". Tolstoy considered that its opening sentences demonstrate the atmospheric sense of place which became one of O'Brian's greatest strengths.  \\"Not Liking to Pass the Road Again\\"  The narrator recalls from his childhood a sinister roadside experience and his youthful attempts to make sense of what he had seen. The story was first published in the magazine Irish Writing in March 1952 during the period when O'Brian was allowing readers and reviewers to assume that he had Irish roots.  \\"The Slope of the High Mountain\\"  The story relates the events of a day's hunting with the Ynysfor hunt in which O'Brian had himself participated. Initially entitled \\"The Slope of Gallt y Wenallt\\" the tale was first published in Harper's Bazaar in January 1954.  \\"The Little Death\\"  A former fighter pilot struggles to come to terms with his wartime experiences. While at a pigeon-shoot, he re-lives shooting down a Messerschmitt, watching fearfully while the plane plummets and waiting in vain for a parachute to open. He has an epiphany: he will never kill again. O'Brian dedicated the story to Armand Go√´au-Brissoinni√®re, a French resistance leader who had been his colleague and friend during the war. He sent him a copy of his book The Last Pool, in which the story appears, along with a note hoping that the recipient would understand his description of the state of mind of a man who was fed up with killing.  \\"The Passeur\\"  A man passes through a remote wood on an unexplained journey. He senses a presence, and hears a voice urging him to come back again at the dark of the moon.  \\"The Tunnel at the Frontier\\"  A man finds himself in a dark tunnel, as if awaking from a dream. He recalls unhappily getting off the train with crowds of other people, all of whom are moving towards the bright sea that can be seen at the tunnel's mouth. He realises that he has been reading and is still holding the book. It is about a man whose wife has died, who has no comfort because he does not believe in a future life, and who ultimately perishes himself. The man asks himself whether it is the book which has made him unhappy. He turns away from the tunnel's mouth, and walks in the opposite direction, into the gloom.  \\"The Path\\"  The narrator finds himself following a narrow winding track across the mountainside. He carries a burdensome pack which he finds intolerable, and which he is forced to carry in his arms like a baby. At the frontier the pack is thoroughly searched, and in spite of its bad revelations he is allowed to pass. He continues along the path, knowing that however quickly he walks he will never be able to catch up with her.  \\"The Walker\\"  The narrator has taken lodgings in a small village by the sea, spending much of his time on long country walks. As he walks, his mind returns repeatedly to religious themes, especially to the Passion. The couple with whom he is lodging are tense, and appear to be constantly in fear of their lives, several people they know having recently died in suspicious circumstances. One night, the narrator cannot sleep and, leaving his bedroom, comes across the couple who are in a far room, listening. He flies at them and murders both in his religious ecstasy. The story was first published in Harper's Bazaar in October 1953. An editorial note of the time commented that it was \\"a haunting narrative of strange retribution\\" that was \\"construed differently by every editor.\\"  \\"The Soul\\"  A very short tale, of little over a page. A soul leaves the cemetery and moves out over the sea towards a distant light.  \\"Lying in the Sun\\"  A man lies on the beach under the blazing sun, cradling his head in the crook of his elbow to block out from sight everything around him. Lying next to him is a woman he met at the hotel, and whom he has due to force of circumstance and cowardice already agreed to marry. He knows he hates her, and that he will have to kill her to make her go away. Time passes and she does not move. He realises that an hour ago she died by his side of a heart attack. He raises his head. There is nobody there: only a hollow in the sand.  \\"Billabillian\\"  \\"Billabillian\\" is a tale of the mutual incomprehension between Cornelius O'Leary, the young Irish Catholic purser of an East Indies merchantman, and his captain, a severe and devout Protestant. O'Leary has unexpectedly been promoted to purser of Trade's Increase after illness on board kills his direct superiors. He is well prepared for his new position (though he has not sailed with this captain before) and has meticulously studied the trading customs of the Spice Islands. He has with him a detailed treatise on local trading practices written by his hugely experienced uncle, and he has learned the relevant sections by heart. At Sumbawa, their next port, trade is allowed subject to Billabillian, a custom under which the king's officials must be allowed access to the cargo before the ship docks, and given the opportunity to purchase anything they desire for half the price that will be requested on land. But O'Leary knows well that Billabillian can be avoided by means of a suitable payment to the officials who will provide a receipt for a higher amount, the difference representing the usual opportunity for valuable personal trades by the captain and his purser. When O'Leary proudly shows his careful preparations and calculations to the captain, he is quite unprepared for the captain's cold and ferocious response, \\"false thief\\". 'Billa-billian' was a real trading custom in the Javanese port of Bantam in 1603‚Äì1605, as reported by the Scottish surgeon Robert Kerr in volume 8 (1813) of his historical study A General History and Collection of Voyages and Travels, Arranged in Systematic Order. O'Brian quotes extensive passages from the book, including the definition of Billabillian which he incorporates into the fictional uncle's treatise.  \\"The Rendezvous\\"  A story of the frustrating and eventually dangerous experiences encountered by a man travelling by train from Paris to England, trying and failing to catch up with a woman he had arranged to meet. Richard Ollard, O'Brian's editor at William Collins, described the tale in his 1973 pre-publication assessment as being \\"disquieting and faintly eerie\\". Tolstoy speculated that the feeling of loss may have derived from the author's occasional and quite irrational concerns that he might lose his wife or her affections.  \\"The Stag at Bay\\"  Edwin is a self-righteous and priggish author who writes with ponderous difficulty about marriage, an institution that he barely understands. His young wife leaves him in order to find some pleasure before it is too late. He is unsure whether she will ever return, but then receives from her an unexpected gift in the shape of a mounted stag's head. He takes it as a token of her esteem.  \\"Samphire\\"  Molly, a young wife, is provoked beyond endurance by her condescending, bullying and overpowering husband and his cold indifference to her feelings. After he forces her in spite of her vertigo to look over the edge of a high sea cliff to see the samphire growing there, she snaps and makes a feeble effort to push him over the edge. He cannot believe what she has done, and tries to get her to say it was an accident. She turns from him without a word and walks back down the path. The story was first published in Harper's Bazaar in March 1954. Tolstoy noted that the couple described are \\"unmistakably\\" his own parents ‚Äì his mother Mary (O'Brian's second wife) and her first husband Dimitri. Mary was only 18 when she married Dimitri, and Tolstoy reads the story as emphasising that their marriage was doomed from the outset.  \\"The Clockmender\\"  The Clockmender has reached such a peak of excellence in his craft that all of the many clocks in his house have been honed to perfection. As he lives for his clocks and has nothing else to absorb his mind and time, the lack of worthwhile tasks makes the hours and days stretch out before him as a depressing and horrifying blank. At last, among the clamour of his clocks striking the hour he realises that one has missed a stroke, and a pale smile comes to his face. In a 1955 review of the first US publication, William Dunlea in Commonweal called the story a \\"strikingly original nightmare.\\" Donald Barr for The New York Times, also writing in 1955, called it \\"a psychological history of a man's hellish constriction of his soul into madness.\\"  \\"The Chian Wine\\"  A nightmarish tale about the dark side of human nature, recounting the violent anti-Semitism in a small village in the south of France. Richard Ollard described this tale in his 1973 assessment for William Collins as \\"exciting and terrifying\\". Tolstoy noted that the opening description provides a lyrical evocation of the largely unaltered Collioure of O'Brian's early days in the town.  \\"The Virtuous Peleg\\"  A comic tale, quite different from the others in the collection, recounting the fantastic adventures of Peleg, a junior monk, with some help from an obliging angel. Reviewing the story for the its 1955 US publication, Donald Barr for The New York Times said that it \\"laughingly arrays the Seven Deadly Sins and the cardinal virtues in the guise of a medieval saint's legend.\\" In his 1973 assessment, Richard Ollard called this story \\"enchantingly funny.\\" King considered it to stand out from his other stories \\"like a glorious speckled trout in a goldfish pond.\\"  \\"A Passage of the Frontier\\"  A fugitive escapes on foot south across the Pyrenees from a military threat emanating the north (the Nazis during World War II in Tolstoy's reading). He eventually reaches the safety of a shepherd's hut, and is asked if he is the Christ. On being told he is not, the shepherd replies that in that case he will not have to kill the lamb. An \\"exciting and terrifying\\" tale according to Ollard's 1973 assessment. Tolstoy considered the story to be a paradigm of the Passion of Christ, \\"although its cryptic ending leaves one guessing at some of the symbolism.\\"  \\"The Voluntary Patient\\"  Mr Philips, a patient in a mental institution, is most insistent that he is only there on a voluntary basis. The staff viciously tease and make fun of him. In a 1955 review of the first US publication, William Dunlea in Commonweal called the story \\"a smart fantasy- satire of auto-suggestive psychotherapy.\\" Donald Barr for The New York Times, also writing in 1955, said that the story \\"shaking with macabre laughter, shows hell itself under the aspect of a madhouse.\\"  \\"The Long Day Running\\"  Another hunting story, based again upon O'Brian's own experiences with the Ynysfor hunt. The hunter is an outsider, new to the sport, who feels he must appear worthy to the regulars. The author casts himself as the black outsider, Kirk, who teeters on the brink of exhaustion, danger and self-discovery. In his assessment of 1973, Richard Ollard considered the tale to be notably good in setting the scene and in evoking the emotions kindled by the sport.  \\"On the Bog\\"  Boyle and Meagher have been friends for many years, although with a rather strained relationship. Boyle has always been leader, and is frequently overbearing and insensitive to Meagher's feelings. When Meagher is invited to join Boyle on a wildfowling expedition and is then treated with disdain, his anger at the humiliation gradually rises to such a pitch of rage that he turns his gun on Boyle. Godfrey Hodgson in The Independent wrote that the author \\"paces to perfection ... the idea that what the narrator feels for his ostensible friend is in fact murderous hatred.\\"  \\"The Lemon\\"  The narrator has lived a solitary life for some years, long enough \\"to grow strange\\". One morning, while reading, he finds his thoughts becoming unmanageable. Trying to puzzle out the cause, he focuses on \\"a sort of dream\\" that he had had the night before: the noise from the ground floor restaurant beneath his flat had become intolerable and he had crept downstairs and removed the main fuse in the lobby, plunging the restaurant into darkness; he threw in a small hand grenade, and retreated back upstairs. He recalls that before his unruly thoughts had interrupted his morning reading he had looked out of the window and seen plate glass still heaped in the gutter. Examining his motivations, the narrator concludes that ‚Äì whether dream or reality ‚Äì since he did not consciously know where the fuse box was, his mind must be guilty of unconscious criminal intent, and that it must logically follow that he is a psychopath who cannot morally continue to live. Tolstoy suggests that this story illustrates the author's propensity, at least in his early days, to use his fiction as a \\"weapon of psychic attack\\". In her 1951 diary, O'Brian's wife had recorded \\"an infernal racket\\" which went on until 6 am, emanating from a restaurant below the flat in Collioure where they lived at the time. Later, she recorded that O'Brian stayed up most of the night writing The Lemon: \\"In the story he (for I fear the nameless protagonist is he) creeps downstairs ... and hurls a hand grenade ('the lemon') into the darkness.\\" \\"Ah, if only ...\\"  \\"The Last Pool\\"  A fisherman spends the day fishing the waters of an Irish mountain stream. He has little success, and continually tells himself as he moves up the rapids that \\"this is the last pool\\". When he reaches the final pool at the head of the cascades a magnificent salmon takes the fly, and after a long struggle the fisherman slips into the dark racing water while attempting to land it. Returning to consciousness, he hears people around him quietly discussing where a priest is to be found.  \\"The Handmaiden\\"  Edward and Paula are expatriates living in Spain. Paula is unable to have a child, and the couple agree that they will ask their poor but attractive Spanish maid, Conchita, whether she would be prepared to bear Edward a child for them. As Paula walks back from the maid's home after putting the question to her family, she has a view from afar into her own garden, and there she sees the girl being amorously chased through the bushes by an unseen man. Incandescent with rage at Edward's apparent deceit, her mind fills with tales she has heard of duplicity within marriage. But as she arrives back, she sees a youth slip out of the garden: it is he not Edward who has been pursuing Conchita.  \\"On the Wolfsberg\\"  An unnamed woman finds herself walking along a road through the mountains. Realising that she does not know who she is, why she is there, nor where she is going, she keeps steadily on, feeling only a bruising around her heart. She sees a sheet of paper on the road, which she hopes will not be symbolic: it contains incomprehensible diagrams, perhaps for solving a puzzle. Then she is joined by a large wolf that follows her at a distance; she hopes again that the wolf is not symbolic. Picking up a stone, she flings it at the animal, suddenly realising who she is and that Hugh Lupus was an empty selfish man, false through and through. In his 1973 assessment Richard Ollard noted this story as being \\"disquieting and faintly eerie.\\" Publication The back cover of the book included a quotation from A. S. Byatt listing a number of authors to whom she returned regularly for \\"cheer or consolation\\". The inclusion of Georgette Heyer in the list offended O'Brian, who considered the book \\"utterly ruined\\" by the comparison. Literary significance and criticism Reviews of the 1994 collection were respectful, in line with O'Brian's reputation. Writing in The Independent, Godfrey Hodgson called the quality \\"unmistakeable\\", and speculated that the tales may have been overlooked when first published because readers \\"cannot bear too much reality.\\" Jane Shilling in The Sunday Telegraph was impressed, too, with the author's \\"perfect cadences\\" and his precise, fluent, economical prose.

It is one of seven educational institutions in the ministry. History The almost century-old history of its formation dates back to 11 June 1921, when local police courses of the Kharkiv militia were established. This date is considered the birthday of the current academy. A year later, on the basis of the former Courses, the School of the Senior Command of the Workers 'and Peasants' Militia of the USSR was established. On 25 December 1922, the zchool was reorganized with state support. After taking the necessary organizational measures, on 23 October 1923, the institution was renamed the All-Ukrainian School of Police and Criminal Investigation. The newly created institution acquired the status of a republican one and began to train senior command staff for police bodies throughout the Ukrainian SSR. In 1925, the All-Ukrainian School was relocated from Kharkiv to Kyiv, where in 1936 the school was renamed the Vsevolod Balitsky School of Senior Chiefs of the Workers 'and Peasants' Militia. At the end of World War II, the school resumed its work and subsequently underwent a number of reorganizations and renamings. In 1960, the Higher School of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR merged with the Kyiv Special Police High School (since 1968 the school was called the Kyiv College of Ministry of Interior. After the proclamation of Ukraine's independence, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine on 27 January 1992 established the Academy of Internal Affairs with its recognition as the main scientific and educational center.

Born in Berlin, Urban completed an apprenticeship as a commercial assistant. He then became an accountant, before moving to become an agent. In 1896, he joined the Free Union of Merchants of Berlin, and moved to work for Albrecht & Meister. In 1903, he became his union's first member of staff, with particular responsibility for its finances. From 1904, he represented the union on the Berlin Trades Council, and in 1908, he was elected as its treasurer. This experience led him to start campaigns in his own union, against on Sundays or after 20:00, and for the rights of women workers. The union became the Central Union of Commercial Employees, and in 1912, it moved its headquarters to Berlin. Urban was elected as its new president, defeating Paul Richter, the executive's preferred candidate. The majority of the executive opposed World War I, and although Urban supported the Socialist Party of Germany's (SPD) pro-war line, he tried to maintain a conciliatory position, supporting his union's vote against the Auxiliary Services Act. As soon as the war ended, Urban looked to re-establish international links, and this led in 1921 to the formation of the International Federation of Commercial, Clerical, Professional and Technical Employees, with Urban becoming its president. In 1919, Urban led the union into a merger with the Union of Office Employees of Germany, which formed the Central Union of Employees (ZdA), Urban becoming joint president. He argued that the union should be linked with the General German Trade Union Federation through its own secretariat, and this was established in 1921 as the AfA-Bund, Urban becoming a vice-president. Urban retained his union positions until the Nazi government banned trade unions in 1933. He was then arrested, along with the ZdA's newspaper editor Georg Ucko, and charged with obscuring the union's balance sheets. He spent several weeks in Pl√∂tzensee Prison, then lived quietly while maintaining links with the international trade union movement, personally visiting individuals in several countries. After World War II, Urban immediately joined the refounded SPD, and was a founding member of the Free German Trade Union Federation (FGDB).

History=Early history (1888‚Äì1930) John Franklin Crowell, Duke football's first head coach The Duke Blue Devils, then known as the Trinity Blue and White, first fielded a football team in 1888, coached by John Franklin Crowell. The first game against North Carolina was the first \\"scientific\\" game in the state. Trinity finished the first two seasons in their football history with records of 2‚Äì1 in 1888 and 1‚Äì1 in 1889. From 1890‚Äì1895, Trinity competed without a head coach.http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/guide/ The 1891 team went undefeated. Trinity did not compete in football from 1895 to 1919. The Trinity Blue and White resumed football competition in 1920 under head coach Floyd J. Egan, compiling a record of 4‚Äì0‚Äì1 that season. In 1921, they finished 6‚Äì1‚Äì2 were led by James A. Baldwin, previously the head coach at Maine.http://www.goduke.com/fls/4200/2012_FB_MediaGuide/DukeFB- MG_87-157_History.pdf In February 1922, Herman Steiner was selected as the head coach of the Trinity College football team for the 1922 season. During the 1922 football season, Steiner coached the Trinity football team to a 7‚Äì2‚Äì1 record as the team outscored its opponents 156‚Äì57. E. L. Alexander took over the reins of the Trinity Blue Devils in 1923 and led the team to a 5‚Äì4 record. In their first season competing as Duke University, Howard Jones took over in 1924 and led the Blue Devils to a 4‚Äì5 record before leaving for USC. Former Indiana head coach James Herron led the Blue Devils to another 4‚Äì5 record in 1925. From 1926 to 1930, the program was led by head coach James DeHart who compiled a 24‚Äì23‚Äì2 record during his tenure. DeHart led the Blue Devils, an independent for all of its history up to that point, into the Southern Conference in 1928. Wallace Wade era (1931‚Äì1950) Wade at Vanderbilt, c. 1921 In late 1930, Wallace Wade shocked the college football world by leaving national powerhouse Alabama for Duke. He had been at Alabama since 1923, after assisting Dan McGugin's Vanderbilt Commodores during two undefeated southern championships. An upset by the Florida Gators in 1923 is all that stopped Alabama from a conference title in Wade's first year. In 1924 he won the SoCon title, and in 1925 and 1926 won national championships. His 1925 team was the first Southern team to win a Rose Bowl. Wade was under fire at Alabama after lackluster seasons in 1928 and 1929, which included narrow losses to Robert Neyland's Tennessee Volunteers. Wade submitted his resignation on April 30, with the caveat that he coach next season. John Suther described the feeling before the Tennessee game that year, which Alabama won 18‚Äì6. \\"Coach Wade was boiling mad. He was like a blood-thirsty drill sergeant anyway, and those critics made him more fiery ... He challenged us to help him shut up the loudmouths that were making his life miserable.\\" In his final year at Alabama, Wade won his third national championship. Though Wade refused to answer questions regarding his decision to leave Alabama for Duke until late in his life, he eventually told a sports historian he believed his philosophy regarding sports and athletics fit perfectly with the philosophy of the Duke administration and that he felt being at a private institution would allow him greater freedom. Wade's success at Alabama translated well to Duke's program. He sent former Alabama players and future Duke assistants Herschel Caldwell and Ellis Hagler to the school a year early to prepare a team. Duke won 7 Southern Conference championships in the 16 years that Wade was coach. He also led the team to 2 Rose Bowls. Wade served a stint in the military in World War II, leaving the team after the 1941 season and returning before the start of the 1946 season. Wade's achievements placed him in the College Football Hall of Fame. In 1933, Duke, led by North Carolina's first first-team All-American Fred Crawford, upset Neyland's Tennessee Volunteers by a score of 10‚Äì2. It was Tennessee's first loss in over two and a half seasons. It caused Neyland to say of Crawford: \\"He gave the finest exhibition of tackle play I have ever seen.\\" The most famous Duke football season came in 1938, when the \\"Iron Dukes\\" went unscored upon for the entire regular season. Duke reached their first Rose Bowl appearance, where they lost 7‚Äì3 when USC scored a touchdown in the final minute of the game on a pass from a second-string quarterback to a third string tight end. While Wallace Wade was serving in the military, Duke football assistant coach Eddie Cameron was promoted to head coach to fill in for Wade until his return from service. Cameron's Blue Devils teams were successful, going 25‚Äì11‚Äì1 in Cameron's four seasons as head coach, highlighted by an 8‚Äì1 1943 season. Cameron's 1944 team won the Sugar Bowl, beating Alabama 29‚Äì26. Cameron would go on to serve as Duke's athletic director from 1951‚Äì1972, and for his service to the athletics program and the university as a whole, Duke named their basketball arena after him, Cameron Indoor Stadium, where the Blue Devils basketball teams still play their home games today. Duke would be invited again to make the trip to Pasadena, California for the 1942 Rose Bowl, this time to play Oregon State. Due to fears of additional west coast attacks by the Japanese in the wake of Pearl Harbor, the decision was made to move the game to Durham. As Duke's stadium was significantly smaller than the regular venue, bleachers were borrowed from North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina, which boosted capacity from 35,000 to 55,000. Despite being 3 to 1 favorites, the Iron Dukes would lose the game 20‚Äì16. Wade retired after the 1950 season and, for his great achievements, Duke named their football stadium after him. The Blue Devils still play their home games at Wallace Wade Stadium. Wade's final record at Duke is 110‚Äì36‚Äì7. Bill Murray era (1951‚Äì1965) Delaware head coach Bill Murray was chosen to replace Wallace Wade as Duke's head coach in 1951.http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/CFHSN/CFHSNv03/CFHSNv03n2a.pdf The football program proved successful under Murray's tutelage, winning six of the first ten ACC football championships from 1953 to 1962.Duke Blue Devils.

Bill Murray would be the last Duke head football coach to leave the Blue Devils with a winning record until Steve Spurrier, and the last to leave Duke after having won multiple conference championships. After Murray's retirement following the 1965 season, Duke's football program would steadily decline into becoming the ACC's \\"cellar-dweller\\". Murray led Duke to its last bowl appearance and conference championships, shared or outright, until 1989. Murray's final record at Duke was 91‚Äì51‚Äì9 in 15 seasons.

The following week, Duke upset #11 West Virginia and followed that with wins over NC Statehttp://www.goduke.com/fls/4200/web-docs/Duke_FB_All- America.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=4200 and Clemson. After losing their next two to Georgia Tech and Wake Forest the Blue Devils defeated South Carolina and lost to North Carolina. Mike McGee era (1971‚Äì1978) Mike McGee returned to his alma mater from East Carolina to serve as head football coach in late 1970. Duke continued in the mediocrity and sub-par on-the-field performances that had been seen under Harp, going 37‚Äì47‚Äì4 overall. McGee's two best years were 1971 and 1974, in which his Duke teams went a mediocre 6‚Äì5. McGee was dismissed after the 1978 season. McGee led the Blue Devils to a 6‚Äì5 record in his first season. Duke began the season strong, winning its first four and five of its first six. Future NFL offensive linesman Ed Newman played as an offensive lineman and defensive lineman, and was a Football All-American in 1971 and a Football All-ACC in 1971 and 1972. However, Duke would lose to Navy and Georgia Tech in consecutive weeks before getting what would be its final win of the season against West Virginia. McGee's Blue Devils lost its last two games of the season to Wake Forest and North Carolina. In 1972, Duke finished 5‚Äì6.

After defeating Georgia Tech and South Carolina to begin the campaign, the Blue Devils traveled to Ann Arbor, Michigan for another game against #4 Michigan, and lost to the Wolverines by a score of 52‚Äì0. The next week, Duke beat Virginia but then lost their next four. After defeating Wake Forest, Duke lost its last two to NC State and North Carolina. Shirley Wilson era (1979‚Äì1982) Coach Wilson Elon head coach Shirley \\"Red\\" Wilson replaced McGee and went 16‚Äì27‚Äì1 as Duke's head football coach. Wilson's teams only won two games in his first two seasons, then had back-to-back 6‚Äì5 records. Wilson's teams became known for their innovative passing attack under offensive coordinator Steve Spurrier, whose 1982 offense featuring quarterback Ben Bennett set a school record for yardage before Wilson retired and Spurrier left to become the head coach of the USFL's Tampa Bay Bandits. Wilson led the Blue Devils to a 2‚Äì8‚Äì1 record in his first season. Duke began the season with a victory over East Carolina. That was followed by a loss to South Carolina, a loss to Virginia, a tie against Army, a win over Richmond, and losses to Clemson, Maryland Georgia Tech, #20 Wake Forest, NC State and North Carolina.

After losing to #6 Clemson and Maryland, the Blue Devils won three straight before losing to North Carolina in the regular season finale. Wilson's last season in 1982 was a 6‚Äì5 campaign. The Blue Devils started the season with three straight wins before losing to four straight. The Blue Devils then beat Georgia Tech and Wake Forest before losing to NC State and defeating North Carolina. Duke's 1982 team, with Steve Spurrier serving as offensive coordinator, was the first in Atlantic Coast Conference history to average more than 300 passing yards per game. Steve Sloan era (1983‚Äì1986) There was hope when Steve Sloan was hired that the Duke football program would finally return to its glory days under Wallace Wade. Sloan played quarterback for Bear Bryant at Alabama in the 1960s and had winning records as the head football coach at both Vanderbilt and Texas Tech, two programs that had struggled prior to his arrival, and also served as head coach at Ole Miss. However, Sloan could not translate his successes from those places to Duke. Sloan's Blue Devils teams had a 13‚Äì31 overall record in the four seasons he was there, failing to win more than four games in a single season. Sloan resigned after four seasons as Duke head coach to become athletics director at the University of Alabama. Sloan led the Blue Devils to a 3‚Äì8 record in his first season. The season began with seven consecutive losses before the Dukies won their first game of the season over Georgia Tech, which was the first in a three-game winning streak. The Blue Devils defeated Wake Forest the following week and followed that with a 27‚Äì26 win over NC State. The Blue Devils lost by a score of 34‚Äì27 to North Carolina in the last game of the 1983 season. The 1984 season was a 2‚Äì9 struggle. After defeating Indiana in the season opener, the Blue Devils lost their next eight. Duke finally broke through with their second win of the season in the season's next-to-last game over NC State by a score of 16‚Äì13. Duke lost in their annual regular season finale bout against North Carolina by a score of 17‚Äì15. In 1985, Duke slightly improved to a 4‚Äì7 record. Sloan's Blue Devils began the season with a victory over Northwestern, then lost to West Virginia and beat Ohio. After losing six straight, the Blue Devils won their last two, defeating NC State and North Carolina. Duke duplicated their 4‚Äì7 mark in 1986, Sloan's last season in Durham. The Blue Devils defeated Northwestern for the second straight year in the season opener, Duke lost to Georgia by a score of 31‚Äì7. The Blue Devils then won their next two, defeating Ohio and Virginia. After losing their next four, Sloan's squad defeated Wake Forest. Duke lost its last two of the season to NC State and North Carolina. Steve Spurrier era (1987‚Äì1989) Coach Spurrier The Duke Blue Devils football program had a string of successful years in the late 1980s when the team's head coach was Steve Spurrier. Spurrier won the Heisman Trophy as a quarterback at Florida in 1966 and had served as an assistant with the Gators, Georgia Tech and Duke as well as head coach of the United States Football League's Tampa Bay Bandits. Duke was Spurrier's first college head coaching position. When Spurrier arrived as Duke's 17th head football coach in program history, he inherited a Duke program that was commonly viewed as the worst football program in the ACC. The Duke football program had not been to a bowl game in more than a quarter-century, since 1960. Unlike most of his predecessors since Wallace Wade, Spurrier was able to have success as Duke's head football coach. He hired coaches Ian Goodall, Joe Jeb, and Patrick Cooke to serve as assistant coaches. Spurrier led the Blue Devils to a share of the ACC title in 1989, its first ACC football title of any kind, shared or outright, since the Bill Murray era. Spurrier won ACC Coach of the Year honors in 1988 and 1989 for his achievements. He led Duke to the 1989 All-American Bowl, a game they lost 49‚Äì21 to Texas Tech. That bowl appearance was the program's first bowl appearance since the 1960 Cotton Bowl. Spurrier's first season in 1987 resulted in a 5‚Äì6 record. The Blue Devils began the season with three wins; defeating Colgate, Northwestern and Vanderbilt. Spurrier's squad then suffered through a four-game losing streak. After defeating Georgia Tech on Halloween, Duke lost its next two before defeating North Carolina in the season finale. Spurrier's squad began the 1988 season by defeating Northwestern, Tennessee, The Citadel, Virginia and Vanderbilt. After losing to #11 Clemson and Maryland, the Blue Devils defeated Georgia Tech, tied NC State and defeated North Carolina. Spurrier's last season in 1989 was an 8‚Äì4 mark. Duke began their season by losing to South Carolina, defeating Northwestern, losing to #17 Tennessee and losing to Virginia. The following week, Spurrier's Blue Devils stunned #7 Clemson by a score of 21‚Äì17 that would begin a seven-game winning streak. The win is Duke's last win over a top 10 ranked opponent to date. Duke followed up the Clemson win with wins over Army, Maryland, Georgia Tech, Wake Forest, #22 NC State and North Carolina (by a score of 41‚Äì0). The Blue Devils then made their first bowl appearance since 1960 in the All- American Bowl, losing to Texas Tech by a score of 49‚Äì21. In what would become a recurring trend at most of his coaching stops, Spurrier's teams regularly beat their biggest rivals while he brashly \\"needled\\" them with jokes and \\"zingers\\" that were amusing to his fans but infuriating to opponents. Spurrier's Duke squads went 3‚Äì0 against archrival North Carolina, including a 41‚Äì0 victory in Chapel Hill that clinched a share of the 1989 ACC title. At Spurrier's suggestion, that win was followed by a joyful team picture taken in front of the Kenan Memorial Stadium scoreboard, a photo that still rankles some Tar Heel supporters. After three seasons and a 20‚Äì13‚Äì1 overall record, and leading the Blue Devils to seemingly unheard of football success, Spurrier left Duke after the 1989 season to accept the head football coaching position at his alma mater Florida, where he would cement his legacy as one of college football's greatest head coaches. Spurrier is the last head football coach to date to leave Duke with a winning record. The 1989 ACC co-championship was the last title, shared or outright, by any school in the state of North Carolina in the pre-championship game era, and would be the last title for a North Carolina-based team until Wake Forest won their second ACC Title in 2006. Barry Wilson era (1990‚Äì1993) Barry Wilson was promoted from assistant coach and took over the Blue Devils football program after the departure of Steve Spurrier, but struggled with a 13‚Äì30‚Äì1 record in four seasons despite inheriting a team that had shared an ACC championship the season before he became the head coach. Unable to duplicate or build upon the successes of his predecessor, Wilson resigned as head coach after the 1993 season. In 1990, the Blue Devils finished with a 4‚Äì7 record. Duke began the season with a loss to South Carolina and a victory over Northwestern. After consecutive losses to #10 Virginia and #19 Clemson,http://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1210&context;=fball_prgms Wilson's Dukies defeated Army and Western Carolina. Duke then lost to Maryland and #16 Georgia Tech before defeating Wake Forest. The Blue Devils finished the season with losses to NC State and North Carolina. In 1991, Duke finished 4‚Äì6‚Äì1. They began the season with a tie to South Carolina. The Blue Devils then won their next two, defeating Rutgershttp://www.goduke.com/fls/4200/media- guides/football/2008-09/fb-2008-19-pp-156-163-timeline.pdf and Colgate. They then lost to Virginia by a score of 34‚Äì3. After defeating Vanderbilt and Maryland in consecutive weeks by a score of 17‚Äì13, the Blue Devils lost their last five to close the season. In 1992, Duke went 2‚Äì9. Duke began the season with a 48‚Äì21 loss to ACC newcomer Florida State. Duke then went 2‚Äì2 over the next four games, losing to Vanderbilt, beating Rice, losing to #14 Virginia, and beating East Carolina. Duke lost its last five games of the season to close out the 1992 campaign. Wilson's last season in 1993 was a 3‚Äì8 mark. Duke kicked off the season against #1 Florida State, losing 45‚Äì7. After losing to Rutgers the next week, Duke defeated Army to win its first game of the season. Duke next lost its next four, starting with #22 Virginia and #11 Tennessee. Duke dropped games to Clemson and Maryland during the latter half of the four- game losing streak. Duke closed the season with two wins and two losses, defeating Wake Forest, losing to Georgia Tech, defeating #22 NC State, and losing to #13 North Carolina. Fred Goldsmith era (1994‚Äì1998) On December 16, 1993, Rice head coach Fred Goldsmith was named Wilson's replacement, becoming the Blue Devils' 19th head football coach. Goldsmith arrived in Durham as a 20-year coaching veteran who had served nine years as defensive coordinator/associate head coach under Ken Hatfield; four years at Air Force and five years at Arkansas. In addition to the five-year head coaching stint at Rice, Goldsmith had served one year as the head coach at Slippery Rock University, an NCAA Division II school located in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania. Under Goldsmith, the Blue Devils compiled a 17‚Äì39 record in five seasons. The Blue Devils rose to prominence again in 1994. The team raced out to an 8‚Äì1 record, and was briefly ranked as high as #13 in the country before losing the last two heart-breaking games of the season 24‚Äì23 to NC State and 41‚Äì40 to arch-rival North Carolina by missing two extra-point attempts. The 1994 team played in the program's first New Years Day Bowl game since 1961, falling to Wisconsin 34‚Äì21 in the 1995 Hall of Fame Bowl, later known as the Outback Bowl. After 1994, however, Duke's football program continued to decline, with the team lacking a winning season the remainder of Goldsmith's tenure. Goldsmith's teams struggled after that 1994 season, failing to win more than four games in a single season. In 1995, the Blue Devils finished 3‚Äì8. They began their season with a loss to #1 Florida State by a score of 70‚Äì26. After defeating Rutgers and Army, Duke lost its next five before defeating Wake Forest. This would be the last conference win until the Blue Devils beat Wake Forest again three seasons later. They then lost their last two to #24 Clemson and North Carolina. Goldsmith's 1996 Duke team went 0‚Äì11, the school's first winless record in the modern era and only the second winless season in school history. In 1997, the Blue Devils went 2‚Äì9. The Blue Devils lost to NC State and Northwestern to start the season, then they broke their losing streak, defeating Army and Navy in consecutive weeks for their only wins of the season. Duke lost to Maryland, #4 Florida State, Virginia, Wake Forest, Clemson, Georgia Tech and #8 North Carolina to close the season. The Blue Devils compiled a 4‚Äì7 record in 1998. Duke won its first two out of the gate, rolling over Western Carolina and Northwestern. Goldsmith's squad lost then lost three in a row, dropping contests to #11 Florida State, #11 Virginia and Georgia Tech. The Blue Devils broke the ACC losing streak with a win against Wake Forest. They managed one more conference win against Clemson and finished the season with losses to Maryland and North Carolina. Goldsmith was fired after the 1998 season with a 17‚Äì39 overall record as head coach of the Blue Devils. Carl Franks era (1999‚Äì2003) On December 1, 1998, his 38th birthday, Carl Franks, offensive coordinator at Florida under former Blue Devils head coach Steve Spurrier, was hired to replace Fred Goldsmith and tasked with turning around the Duke football program. A Duke alum, Franks had also served as running backs coach at Duke under Spurrier from 1987‚Äì1989 and had played running back and tight end for the Blue Devils under Shirley Wilson from 1980‚Äì1982. The hiring was well-received and applauded, as Franks had overseen one of college football's most potent and explosive offenses that helped the Gators win the national championship in 1996, coached a Heisman Trophy winner in Danny Wuerffel and had many players drafted into the National Football League. Franks led the Blue Devils to a 3‚Äì8 record in 1999. The Franks era began with losses to East Carolina, Northwestern, Vanderbilt and #1 Florida State. The Blue Devils won their first game of the season in their fifth game of the season against Virginia. After consecutive losses to #8 Georgia Tech and NC State, Duke went 2‚Äì2 in the last four games; beating Maryland, losing to Clemson, beating Wake Forest, and losing to North Carolina. From 2000 to 2001 Duke suffered a 22-game losing streak, with both the 2000 and 2001 seasons being winless 0‚Äì11 campaigns, with only four of the 22 losses coming by eight points or fewer. During the streak, Franks, when asked what the team's problems were, was quoted as saying \\"Winning football games has certainly been harder than I anticipated.\\" Duke finished 2‚Äì10 in 2002. The Blue Devils ended their long losing streak spanning two full seasons in the season opener against East Carolina by a score of 23‚Äì16. Duke then dropped its next three to Louisville, Northwestern, and #5 Florida State before defeating Navy by a score of 43‚Äì17. It would prove to be Duke's last win of the season, as the Blue Devils lost its last seven to finish the year. Duke went 4‚Äì8 in 2003. #18 Virginia defeated the Blue Devils in the season opener by a score of 27‚Äì0. After defeating Western Carolina and Rice the next two weeks, Duke lost its next six games, prompting the athletics administration to dismiss Franks as head coach after losing to Wake Forest. Defensive coordinator Ted Roof was appointed interim head coach. The Blue Devils' 1999‚Äì2001 teams were ranked 7th in a list on the 10 worst college football teams of all time by ESPN's Page 2. After going 7‚Äì45 in four full seasons and a partial fifth, Franks was fired and replaced by his defensive coordinator Ted Roof. Despite the poor record, Franks was lauded for the academic success of his players, evidenced by his program winning the Academic Achievement Award from the American Football Coaches Association in 2003. Ted Roof era (2004‚Äì2007) Coach Roof Ted Roof was elevated from defensive coordinator and named interim Duke head coach for the final five games of the 2003 season. The Blue Devils won two of their last three games of the season, Roof's interim tag was removed, and he was named the program's 21st head football coach in 2004. Roof's good times did not last, as he also struggled mightily as Duke's head coach, compiling a dismal 6‚Äì45 record before his firing after four seasons and a partial fifth. One positive aspect, however, from Roof's tenure was that Duke defenses consistently ranked in the top 30 in tackles for loss for the first time in years. Roof would go on to win a national championship as Auburn's defensive coordinator in 2010 under head coach Gene Chizik. Roof led the Blue Devils to a 2‚Äì9 record in 2004. Roof's squad began the season with four straight losses to Navy, UConn, Virginia Tech and #23 Maryland. The Blue Devils earned their first win of the season in their fifth game of the season against FCS opponent The Citadel. Duke then suffered through another four-game losing streak; losing to Georgia Tech, #14 Virginia, Wake Forest and #13 Florida State. Duke then beat Clemson and lost to North Carolina to cap the season. In 2005, the Blue Devils finished 1‚Äì10 The Blue Devils started with losses to East Carolina and #7 Virginia Tech before winning their only contest of the season over FCS opponent VMI. Duke finished the season with losses to #23 Virginia, Navy, #9 Miami, Georgia Tech #11 Florida State, Wake Forest, Clemson and North Carolina. After a winless 0‚Äì12 campaign in 2006, the 2007 team finished 1‚Äì11. Roof led his squad to a 1‚Äì11 record in his final season. Duke began the season with losses to UConn and Virginia. After defeating Northwestern to snap a 22-game losing streak, Duke dropped its last nine games to Navy, Miami, Wake Forest, #12 Virginia Tech, Florida State, Clemson, Georgia Tech, Notre Dame and North Carolina. David Cutcliffe era (2008‚Äìpresent) Coach Cutcliffe In December 2007, Tennessee offensive coordinator and former Ole Miss head coach David Cutcliffe was hired as Duke's 22nd head football coach. Cutcliffe had a reputation for being an outstanding offensive mind and quarterbacks coach, as he had helped develop both Peyton and Eli Manning. As offensive coordinator under head coach Phillip Fulmer with the Tennessee Volunteers, he oversaw an explosive offense that helped the Volunteers win the 1998 national championship. In 2008, a judge ruled in favor of Duke after they pulled out of a four-game contract with the University of Louisville; the judge stated that it was up to Louisville to find a suitable replacement as, he wrote in the ruling, Duke's lawyers had persuasively argued that any Division I team would be equivalent or better. Duke went 4‚Äì8 in 2008 and Duke's 2009 season was a 5‚Äì7 record, the closest the school had come to bowl eligibility since 1994.Duke looks to rebound In January 2010, following Lane Kiffin's abrupt departure for USC after one season as head coach at Tennessee, Cutcliffe, an assistant coach for the Volunteers for twenty years, quickly emerged as a leading candidate to replace Kiffin. Cutcliffe, however, ultimately rebuffed Tennessee's overtures, remaining at Duke and stating, \\"After much thought and consideration, Karen and I reached the decision that Duke is the place for our family. We have both family members and lifetime friends in the Knoxville community and share a deep respect for the University of Tennessee. Our ties to the school and the eastern Tennessee area are obvious. But before Tennessee's hiring process comes to a conclusion, I know that Duke University is where I want to coach.\\" The position eventually went to Derek Dooley. Cutcliffe's decision was widely lauded as a rare example of commitment and integrity among prominent college football coaches. Cutcliffe's Duke teams had back-to-back 3‚Äì9 seasons in 2010 and 2011. Duke's 2012 team, despite low preseason expectations, after a 33‚Äì30 win against rival North Carolina became bowl eligible for the first time since 1994. Extending its season to December 27, 2012, Duke fell to Cincinnati 48‚Äì34 in a close contest in the 2012 Belk Bowl, finishing the season with a 6‚Äì7 record. On November 21, 2012, Duke extended Cutcliffe's contract through June 2019. Cutcliffe meeting with players, 2012 Duke's 2013 season was a break-out year, as the Blue Devils have continued to cross off many of their infamous losing streaks. On October 26, 2013, Duke achieved its first win over a ranked team since 1994 with a 13‚Äì10 victory over #14 Virginia Tech at Lane Stadium in Blacksburg, Virginia, a rarity for the Duke football program. That win over Virginia Tech was also Duke's first road win over a ranked team since 1971. Following a bye week, on November 9, 2013 the Blue Devils achieved their first winning season since 1994 with a 38‚Äì20 home victory over in-state rival NC State, their seventh of the season. Extending its winning streak to 6 straight by defeating #24 Miami 48‚Äì30 on November 16, Duke appeared in the AP Poll for the first time since 1994, listed at #25 with a record of 8‚Äì2. With a win at Wake Forest on November 23, 2013, Duke claimed its ninth victory in a regular season for the first time since 1941, the season in which the Blue Devils hosted the Rose Bowl. The win also gave Duke at least a share of the Coastal Division title and a #24 AP Poll ranking. With a 27‚Äì25 win over North Carolina on November 30, 2013, Duke locked up their first 10-win season in school history, the Coastal Division title, and a spot in the 2013 ACC Championship Game against Florida State, during which time Duke was ranked #20. The Blue Devils lost that game to the Seminoles, the eventual national champions, by a score of 45‚Äì7. David Cutcliffe received the Walter Camp Coach of the Year award in 2013. The Blue Devils were invited to the Chick-fil-A Bowl, where they lost another close, hard-fought game 52‚Äì48 to Texas A&M; to finish the season with a record of 10‚Äì4. After the 2013 season, offensive coordinator Kurt Roper left Duke to accept the same position on Will Muschamp's staff at Florida. With Scottie Montgomery in his first season as offensive coordinator, Duke finished 9‚Äì4 in 2014. The Blue Devils began the season with four wins; defeating Elon, Troy, Kansas and Tulane. Cutcliffe's squad suffered its first defeat in the season's fifth game against Miami. Duke then won its next four; defeating #22 Georgia Tech (the team's first victory over the Yellow Jackets in a decade), Virginia, Pittsburgh and Syracuse. After dropping consecutive games to Virginia Tech and North Carolina, The Blue Devils closed the regular season with a win over Wake Forest. Duke was offered and accepted a berth in the Sun Bowl, a game they lost to #15 Arizona State by a score of 36‚Äì31. Wide receiver Jamison Crowder was the team's star player and would be drafted in the fourth round in the 2015 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins. Crowder finished his career tied for the most receptions in ACC football history with 283 for 3,641 yards and 23 touchdowns. He also returned a school-record four punt returns for touchdowns. Cutcliffe's success at Duke placed him as a candidate in several head coaching searches, including at Michigan (a job that eventually went to Jim Harbaugh) and Louisville (a job that eventually went to Bobby Petrino). 2015 would see the Blue Devils finish 8‚Äì5. Duke began the season with wins over Tulane and NC Central. After losing to #23 Northwestern, the Blue Devils won their next four; defeating #20 Georgia Tech, Boston College, Army and Virginia Tech (in a four-overtime thriller). Cutcliffe's team then embarked upon a four-game losing streak; beginning with a controversial loss to Miami. The Hurricanes used eight laterals (reminiscent of the 1982 Cal-Stanford ending) on a kickoff return with no time remaining to score the game-winning touchdown and stun the Blue Devils by a score of 30‚Äì27. However, video evidence showed the play should have been blown dead and not counted as a touchdown, as Miami players who possessed the ball on that play's knee were shown to be on the ground more than once. Although the outcome of the game couldn't be changed, the Atlantic Coast Conference subsequently suspended the game and replay officials for failing to catch the errors and make the correct call. Duke then lost games to #21 North Carolina by a score of 66‚Äì31, Pittsburgh by a score of 31‚Äì13 and Virginia by a score of 42‚Äì34. Duke concluded the regular season by snapping its four-game losing streak in a 27‚Äì21 win over Wake Forest. Duke finished the season by winning its first bowl game since 1961, defeating Indiana in overtime by a score of 44‚Äì41 in the Pinstripe Bowl. After the 2015 season, offensive coordinator Scottie Montgomery left the Blue Devils to accept the head coaching position at East Carolina. To replace Montgomery, Cutcliffe promoted Zac Roper to offensive coordinator. 2015 also marked the beginning of a $100 million renovation project to Wallace Wade Stadium. These renovations were initiated in an attempt to attract higher rated recruiting prospects and improve the overall fan experience. These renovations include, a new press box, new increased seating capacity, as well as new concourse and public area modifications. These changes began with the first phase in 2015 with the conclusion on the last home game. These initial changes consisted of dropping the field itself several feet down. This allowed the new stadium seats to be built into the newly created area cleared out by the field being dropped by over 6 feet. The second part of phase 1 was to clear the old existing press box. After this was concluded, there was a temporary press box built to house all media and stadium personnel during the 2015 season. After the conclusion of the 2015‚Äì2016 season phase 2 began. This phase consisted of building the new press box as well as a new scoreboard. This phase was concluded by the beginning of the 2016 season. Phase 3, which is the final phase in the project, will be concluded during the beginning of the 2016‚Äì2017 football season. This final phase consisted of finishing the renovation to the concourse area's as well as the entrances to the stadium itself. This construction, which is being carried out by The Beck Group is still underway and is expected to be concluded before the start of the 2016‚Äì2017 season. Cutcliffe's Blue Devils struggled to a 4‚Äì8 record in 2016. Duke kicked off the season with a 49‚Äì6 win over NC Central. After losing to Wake Forest and Northwestern the next two weeks, the Blue Devils upset Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana in the season's fourth game by a score of 38‚Äì35. The win was big for the Blue Devils. The Irish, one of college football's most consistent and storied national powers, came into the contest as 21-point favorites at home and suffered one of the worst defeats in their history. Duke then lost to Virginia and beat Army in messy conditions due to Hurricane Matthew. Next, the Blue Devils lost their next three to #7 Louisville, Georgia Tech and #23 Virginia Tech. After upsetting archrival #15 North Carolina, the Blue Devils closed the season with losses to Pittsburgh and Miami. On May 1, 2017, Duke again extended Cutcliffe's contract, keeping their head coach in Durham through June 30, 2021. Duke finished 7‚Äì6 in 2017. They started the season on September 2 with a 60‚Äì7 victory over in-state Football Championship Subdivision opponent NC Central. In the season's second game, the Blue Devils defeated Northwestern by a margin of 41‚Äì17. Duke then defeated Baylor by a score of 34‚Äì20 to pick up their third victory of the season. Cutcliffe's squad improved to 4‚Äì0 after a 27‚Äì17 victory over archrival North Carolina on September 23. Then, the Blue Devils embarked upon a six-game losing streak, beginning with a 31‚Äì6 loss to #14 Miami. On October 7, Duke lost to Virginia by a margin of 28‚Äì21. The next week, they lost to Pittsburgh by a score of 24‚Äì17. The Blue Devils' fifth straight loss came on October 28 in the form of a 24‚Äì3 defeat at the hands of #13 Virginia Tech. After a 21‚Äì16 loss to Army, Cutcliffe's Blue Devils snapped their skid with a 43‚Äì20 win over Georgia Tech. In the regular season finale, the Blue Devils picked up their sixth win and attained bowl eligibility with a 31‚Äì23 win over rival Wake Forest. Duke accepted a berth in the 2017 Quick Lane Bowl, where they defeated Northern Illinois by a score of 36‚Äì14.

She is most famous for her work desegregating living spaces in Falls Church, working to build better facilities for black students in Falls Church, Virginia and starting the CCPL (Colored Citizens Protective League), the first rural branch of the NAACP.  Early life and family  Mary Ellen Henderson (n√©e Meriwether) was born in Washington, D.C., on September 18th, 1885, to Mary Louise Meriwether and James Henry Meriwether. Both of her parents had a college education. Her mother, Mary Louise, graduated from Oberlin College in Ohio, went on to teach at the first high school for black students in Washington, D.C., and worked as a social activist. Mary Ellen's father, James, graduated from Howard University. He later practiced law in Washington D.C. and served on the Board of Trustees at Howard until his death in 1906. Her sister, Sarah Meriwether Nutter, was also an educator and activist.  Career and activism  Mary Ellen, nicknamed \\"Miss Nellie\\" by her students, originally taught grades four through seven at James E. Lee Elementary School, a segregated two-room schoolhouse for black children. She accepted the job to prevent the school from being closed down due to a lack of adequately trained teachers. The school had no running water or custodial staff, so Henderson brought water from a neighbor‚Äôs well and cleaned the classroom daily. The building also did not have a central heating system or indoor sanitary facilities, resources that the white school did have. Henderson fought for a better school for African-American children, conducting a study on the funding inequalities between black and white schools in Fairfax County, Our Disgrace and Shame: School Facilities for Negro Children in Fairfax County. Henderson was persuasive, and in 1948, Fairfax opened the new James E. Lee Elementary School, a six-room school, complete with the additions of an auditorium, library, clinic, and cafeteria. Henderson was appointed as principal of the new school, a position she held for thirty years. The students Mary Ellen Henderson taught were known for their high achievements, and received praise from their high school teachers. The students she taught would later on become important members of the community, or even teachers themselves. Henderson and her husband, E. B. Henderson, founded the Colored Citizens‚Äô Protective League (CCPL), alongside Joseph Tinner, to protest segregated neighborhoods. In 1915, a law was passed by white qualified voters in Falls Church that would force the African American population to live in their own section of town; 32% of the population had to live in less than 5% of the land. The CCPL filed a lawsuit that prevented the ordinance from being enforced. The ordinance was nullified in 1917 by the Supreme Court, and officially removed in 1999. The CCPL eventually, in 1918, formed the basis of the Fairfax County Branch of the NAACP, the first rural branch of the NAACP. Both of the Hendersons were honored in 1960 by the Fairfax County Council on Human Relations for their battle against racial bias. They were also honored by the United States House of Representatives in 2006, when they were recognized in the Congressional Record by Representative Jim Moran, \\"For every person of national recognition there is a local leader that accomplishes much under the shadow of their more recognized peers. Two of these people are Dr. Edwin and Mrs. Mary Ellen Henderson, civil rights pioneers from Northern Virginia that worked for social justice for nearly 50 years.\\"  Our Disgrace and Shame: School Facilities for Negro Children in Fairfax County In 1945, Mary Ellen Henderson composed a study, Our Disgrace and Shame: School Facilities for Negro Children in Fairfax County, on the inequalities between black and white schools in Fairfax County to promote the allocation of more resources for her school. Children at the white schools rode in heated buses to and from school, while students at the black schools took decrepit, non-heated buses, if they lived close enough to take buses at all (some children walked for about five miles every day). The budget for every school in the Fairfax area in 1935 was $340,050. 97.4% of that money ($330,750) was spent on white schools, while only 2.6% ($9,000) was spent on black schools. There was a similar monetary disparity in the 1945-46 school year; the capital outlay budget for white schools was $745,000 about ($13 million today) while the budget for black schools was just a fraction of that, $45,000. Many segregated schools didn't get funding for additions like cafeterias. Five white schools, on the other hand, were funded with anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 to make additions. Henderson was able to use the disparities outlined in the report to convince the Fairfax County School Board to build the new 6-room schoolhouse and divide funds equally in the future.  Personal Life  Mary Ellen Henderson attended the Normal School (now known as The D.C. Teachers College), where she met her lifetime partner, Dr. Edwin Bancroft \\"E.B.\\" Henderson. He would later become the first black physical education director in a city school system [4] and the president of the Virginia Chapter of the NAACP. They both graduated at the top of their classes, Mary Ellen in 1905 and Edwin in 1904. The two were married on Christmas Eve, 1910. Nikki, the Hendersons' granddaughter-in-law, recounted: \\"The year 1910 was a big year for the Hendersons. They married on Christmas Eve day at the 15th Street Presbyterian Church, with E.B. promising his bride he would not play basketball after they were married. The bride and groom headed to New York City to spend their honeymoon weekend, where the groom played his last basketball game, winning the 1910 Colored World Basketball Championship on their wedding night!\\" Mary Ellen and E.B. moved to Falls Church in 1911 in what would later be designated an ‚Äúall-white district.‚Äù They had two children together while living in Falls Church, Edwin Meriwether Henderson in 1912 and James Henry Meriwether Henderson in 1917. As a member of the NAACP, Girl Scouts, League of Women Voters, Falls Church Women's Democratic Club, Virginia Education Association, and National Education Association, Henderson was an active member of her community. She was also a lifetime member of the 15th Street Presbyterian Church, although she also taught Sunday school and played the organ at Second Baptist Church in Falls Church City. In 1965, the Hendersons moved to Tuskegee, Alabama to be closer to their son James, who was the director of the Carver Research Foundation of Tuskegee University. Even after they moved, the Hendersons visited their summer home at Highland Beach near Annapolis, Maryland, where Mary Ellen was an active member in local civic affairs.  Death and Legacy  Toward the end of her life, Mary Ellen Henderson moved to the Wisconsin Avenue Nursing Home, where she passed away on February 4, 1976, at the age of ninety. Her funeral was held on February 7, 1976 at the McGuire Funeral Home. Henderson was cremated and interred at the Meriwether family plot in Woodlawn Cemetery, in Washington, D.C. Mary Ellen Henderson is memorialized by the school that bears her name: Mary Ellen Henderson Middle School in Falls Church City, Virginia. The school was dedicated to her on September 18, 2005, the 120th anniversary of her birth.

Biography Originally from London, Burgess studied at Cardiff University, where he wrote an undergraduate dissertation on bronze-age metalwork from the Thames. For most of his career, he worked at Newcastle University, where he focused on the archaeology of north east of England, and formed relationships with both amateur archaeologists and international scholars. Sometime in or after the 1980s, Burgess moved to France, having grown \\"disillusioned\\" with trends in British archaeology. (This disillusionment is expressed most forcefully in a note published in the 2001 reissue of his textbook, The Age of Stonehenge.) In this period he was particularly interested in the archaeology of Sardinia. He returned to England for medical treatment towards the end of his life. Contributions In the 1960s, Burgess developed a scheme for Bronze Age chronology that is still in use today. He established the Bronze Age Studies Group, and international group of scholars that first met in 1976, and continued to meet as late as 2016. Building on his undergraduate dissertation, his 1988 work, written with I. A. Colquhoun, The swords of Britain, catalogs over 800 examples of Bronze Age swords. Burgess and Colquhoun use methods from experimental archaeology to suggest that it took three weeks to manufacture a sword, with Bronze Age technology.See the abstract of The swords of Britain at the Archaeology Data Service. Burgess published on archaeological topics for a full five decades; his last publication appeared in 2012.

Los Llanos Formation over the years has been controversially described as ranging from Late Cretaceous to Miocene, but the Miocene succession was assigned to Las Mulitas Formation in 2019. The formation rests on top of the Early Permian Los Sauces and Patqu√≠a Formations and in parts on Ordovician crystalline basement. The maximum thickness is estimated at . The sandstones and conglomerates of the formation were deposited ij a fluvial environment. The formation crops out in the , where more than 90 titanosaurid nesting sites were discovered in Los Llanos Formation. The sites were encountered on top of areas characterized by hydrothermal activity as geysers and other vents, suggesting a preferred location for the incubation of the dinosaur eggs. Apart from fossil eggs, the formation has provided fossil flora and ostracods. The crocodyliform Llanosuchus, described in 2016 from the formation, was named after Los Llanos Formation.  Description  Paleogeography of the Late Cretaceous with distribution of titanosaur nesting sites The Los Llanos Formation was first formally described by Bodenbender in 1911.Bodenbender, 2011 The formation crops out in very localized patches in the south of La Rioja Province.Hechenleitner, 2017, p.23 Los Llanos Formation is found on the western and eastern slopes of the eponymous Sierra de Los Llanos, in the Sierra de Chepes, Sierra Ulapes, Sierra de Velasco and Sierra Brava.Hechenleitner, 2017, p.24 Between the original definition of \\"Los Estratos de Los Llanos\\" (Los Llanos Beds) by Bodenbender and later analysis during the twentieth century, a number of controversies arose. Rusconi (1936), Bordas (1941), Pascual (1954), Gui√±az√∫ (1962) and Zuzek (1978) assigned a Miocene age to the formation, based on mammal fossils found in the strata.Hechenleitner, 2017, p.25 This unit is presently known as the Las Mulitas Formation.Chiesa et al., 2019, p.292 The occurrence of typical Cretaceous charophytes confirms the assigned age for Los Llanos Formation. Los Llanos Formation unconformably overlies the Permian Los Sauces Formation in the Sierra de Velasco and the Permian Patqu√≠a Formation or Ordovician granitic basement in other places. The maximum recorded thickness in the Sanagasta Geologic Park is ,Hechenleitner, 2017, p.26 while in the region of Tama the formation reaches an estimated thickness of .Hechenleitner, 2017, p.29 It comprises lightgrey and orange sandstones with basal conglomerate beds, deposited in a fluvial environment, which in the Sanagasta park is associated with hydrothermal activity. Hechenleitner, 2017, p.34 The more than 90 sauropod nests were found in direct association with these hydrothermal vents, suggesting a preferred incubation location of the mother dinosaurs.Hechenleitner, 2017, p.35  Paleontological significance  Interpretation of nest excavation and egg laying by a titanosaur The formation has provided fossilized nesting sites attributed to a titanosaurid dinosaur. Research conducted in 2015 by Hechenleitner et al. include a comparison with the Cretaceous Sanpetru Formation of Ha»õeg paleo-island in Romania, the Tremp Formation of the Spanish Pre-Pyrenees and the Boseong Formation of the Gyeongsang Basin in South Korea.Hechenleitner et al., 2015, p.6  Fossil content  The following fossils were reported from the formation:Los Llanos Formation at Fossilworks.org * Reptiles ** Crocodyliforms *** Llanosuchus tamaensisFiorelli et al., 2016 * Oofossils ** Faveoloolithidae indet.Grellet- Tinner & Fiorelli, 2010 * Invertebrates ** Ostracods *** Ilyocypris triebeliCarignano et al., 2013 *** Wolburgiopsis neocretacea * Flora ** Gobichara (Pseudoharrisichara) groeberiDe Sosa et al., 2017, p.34 ** Lychnothamnus (Pseudoharrisichara) tenuis ** Lychnothamnus (Pseudoharrisichara) walpurgica  See also  * List of dinosaur-bearing rock formations * Allen Formation, Campanian to Maastrichtian fossiliferous formation of the Neuqu√©n Basin * Anacleto Formation, Campanian ooliferous formation of the Neuqu√©n Basin * Angostura Colorada Formation, Campanian to Maastrichtian fossiliferous formation of the North Patagonian Massif * La Colonia Formation, Campanian to Maastrichtian formation of the Ca√±ad√≥n Asfalto Basin * Colorado Formation, Campanian to Maastrichtian fossiliferous formation of the Colorado Basin * Lago Colhu√© Huap√≠ Formation, Campanian to Maastrichtian fossiliferous formation of the Golfo San Jorge Basin  References = Bibliography     Category:Geologic formations of Argentina Category:Upper Cretaceous Series of South America Category:Cretaceous Argentina Category:Campanian Stage Category:Sandstone formations Category:Conglomerate formations Category:Fluvial deposits Category:Ooliferous formations Category:Fossiliferous stratigraphic units of South America Category:Paleontology in Argentina Category:Geology of La Rioja Province, Argentina ","title":"Los Llanos Formation"},{"id":"64322277","text":"This is a list of Filipino Canadians who have made significant contributions to Canadian culture, politics, or society.

It is one of the earliest attempts to use Gaussian processes in high-dimensional settings. It has since been extensively generalized giving rise to many contemporary approximations.  Intuition  A joint probability distribution for events A, B, and C, denoted P(A,B,C), can be expressed as : P(A,B,C) = P(A) P(B  A) P(C  A,B) Vecchia's approximation takes the form, for example, : P(A,B,C) \\\\approx P(A) P(B  A) P(C  A ) and is accurate when events B and C are close to conditionally independent given knowledge of A. Of course one could have alternatively chosen the approximation : P(A,B,C) \\\\approx P(A) P(BA) P(C  B) and so use of the approximation requires some knowledge of which events are close to conditionally independent given others. Moreover, we could have chosen a different ordering, for example : P(A,B,C) \\\\approx P(C) P(CA) P(BA). Fortunately, in many cases there are good heuristics making decisions about how to construct the approximation. More technically, general versions of the approximation lead to a sparse Cholesky factor of the precision matrix. Using the standard Cholesky factorization produces entries which can be interpreted as conditional correlations with zeros indicating no independence (since the model is Gaussian). These independence relations can be alternatively expressed using graphical models and there exist theorems linking graph structure and vertex ordering with zeros in the Cholesky factor. In particular, it is known that independencies that are encoded in a moral graph lead to Cholesky factors of the precision matrix that have no fill-in.  Formal description = The problem  Let x be a Gaussian process indexed by \\\\mathcal{S} with mean function \\\\mu and covariance function K. Assume that S = {s_1, \\\\dots, s_n} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{S} is a finite subset of \\\\mathcal{S} and \\\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \\\\dots, x_n)) is a vector of values of x evaluated at S, i.e. x_i = x(s_i) for i=1, \\\\dots, n. Assume further, that one observes \\\\mathbf{y} = (y_1, \\\\dots, y_n) where y_i = x_i + \\\\varepsilon_i with \\\\varepsilon_i \\\\overset{\\\\text{i.i.d.}}{\\\\sim} \\\\mathcal{N}(0, \\\\sigma^2). In this context the two most common inference tasks include evaluating the likelihood : \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathbf{y}) = \\\\int f(\\\\mathbf{y}, \\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\, d\\\\mathbf{x}, or making predictions of values of x for s^* \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} and s ot\\\\in S, i.e. calculating : f(x(s^*)\\\\mid y_1, \\\\dots, y_n).  Original formulation  The original Vecchia method starts with the observation that the joint density of observations f(\\\\mathbf{y}) = \\\\left(y_1, \\\\dots, y_n\\\\right) can be written as a product of conditional distributions : f(\\\\mathbf{y}) = f(y_1)\\\\prod_{i=2}^n f(y_i\\\\mid y_{i-1}, \\\\dots, y_1). Vecchia approximation assumes instead that for some k \\\\ll n : \\\\hat{f}(\\\\mathbf{y}) = f(y_1)\\\\prod_{i=2}^n f(y_i\\\\mid y_{i-1}, \\\\dots, y_{\\\\max(i-k,1)} ). Vecchia also suggested that the above approximation be applied to observations that are reordered lexicographically using their spatial coordinates. While his simple method has many weaknesses, it reduced the computational complexity to \\\\mathcal{O}(nk^3). Many of its deficiencies were addressed by the subsequent generalizations.  General formulation  While conceptually simple, the assumption of the Vecchia approximation often proves to be fairly restrictive and inaccurate. This inspired important generalizations and improvements introduced in the basic version over the years: the inclusion of latent variables, more sophisticated conditioning and better ordering. Different special cases of the general Vecchia approximation can be described in terms of how these three elements are selected .  Latent variables  To describe extensions of the Vecchia method in its most general form, define z_i = (x_i, y_i) and notice that for \\\\mathbf{z} = (z_1, \\\\dots, z_n) it holds that like in the previous section : f(\\\\mathbf{z}) = f(x_1, y_1) \\\\left( \\\\prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i\\\\mid z_{1:i-1}) \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\prod_{i=1}^n f(y_i\\\\mid x_i) \\\\right) because given x_i all other variables are independent of y_i.  Ordering  It has been widely noted that the original lexicographic ordering based on coordinates when \\\\mathcal{S} is two- dimensional produces poor results . More recently another orderings have been proposed, some of which ensure that points are ordered in a quasi-random fashion. Highly scalable, they have been shown to also drastically improve accuracy .  Conditioning  Similar to the basic version described above, for a given ordering a general Vecchia approximation can be defined as : \\\\hat{f}(\\\\mathbf{z}) = f(x_1, y_1) \\\\left( \\\\prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i\\\\mid z_{q(i)}) \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\prod_{i=1}^n f(y_i\\\\mid x_i) \\\\right), where q(i) \\\\subset \\\\left{1, \\\\dots, i-1\\\\right}. Since y_i \\\\perp x_{-i}, y_{-i} \\\\mid x_i it follows that f(x_i\\\\mid z_{q(i)}) = f(x_i\\\\mid x_q(i), y_q(i)) = f(x_i\\\\mid x_q(i)) since suggesting that the terms f(x_i\\\\mid z_{q(i)}) be replaced with f(x_i\\\\mid x_{q(i)}). It turns out, however, that sometimes conditioning on some of the observations z_i increases sparsity of the Cholesky factor of the precision matrix of (\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}). Therefore, one might instead consider sets q_y(i) and q_x(i) such that q(i) = q_y(i) \\\\cup q_x(i) and express \\\\hat{f} as : \\\\hat{f}(\\\\mathbf{z}) = f(x_1, y_1) \\\\left( \\\\prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i\\\\mid x_{q_x(i)}, y_{q_y(i)}) \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\prod_{i=1}^n f(y_i\\\\mid x_i) \\\\right). Multiple methods of choosing q_y(i) and q_x(i) have been proposed, most notably the nearest-neighbour Gaussian process (NNGP) and multi- resolution approximation (MRA) approaches using q(i) = q_x(i), standard Vecchia using q(i) = q_y(i) and Sparse General Vecchia where both q_y(i) and q_x(i) are non-empty .

Like approximations of other models, they can often be expressed as additional assumptions imposed on the model, which do not correspond to any actual feature, but which retain its key properties while simplifying calculations. Many of these approximation methods can be expressed in purely linear algebraic or functional analytic terms as matrix or function approximations. Others are purely algorithmic and cannot easily be rephrased as a modification of a statistical model.  Basic ideas  In statistical modeling, it is often convenient to assume that y \\\\in \\\\mathcal{Y}, the phenomenon under investigation is a Gaussian process indexed by X \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X} = \\\\mathcal{X}_1 \\\\times \\\\mathcal{X}_2 \\\\dots \\\\mathcal{X}_d which has mean function \\\\mu: \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{Y} and covariance function K: \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}. One can also assume that data \\\\mathbf{y} = (y_1, \\\\dots, y_n) are values of a particular realization of this process for indices \\\\mathbf{X} = X_1, \\\\dots, X_n. Consequently, the joint distribution of the data can be expressed as : \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\mathbf{\\\\mu}, \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}), where \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma} = \\\\left[ K(X_i, X_j) \\\\right]_{i,j=1}^n and \\\\mathbf{\\\\mu} = \\\\left(\\\\mu(X_1), \\\\mu(X_2), \\\\dots, \\\\mu(X_d)\\\\right)^{\\\\top}, i.e. respectively a vector a matrix with the covariance function values and a vector with the mean function values at corresponding (pairs of) indices. The negative log- likelihood of the data then takes the form : -\\\\log\\\\ell(\\\\mathbf{y}) = \\\\frac{d}{2\\\\pi} + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\log\\\\det(\\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}) + \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{y}-\\\\mathbf{\\\\mu}\\\\right)^\\\\top\\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{y}-\\\\mathbf{\\\\mu}\\\\right) Similarly, the best predictor of \\\\mathbf{y}^*, the values of y for indices \\\\mathbf{X}^* = \\\\left(X_1^*, X_2^*, \\\\dots, X_d^*\\\\right), given data \\\\mathbf{y} has the form : \\\\mathbf{\\\\mu}^*_\\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left[\\\\mathbf{y}^*\\\\mathbf{y}\\\\right] = \\\\mathbf{\\\\mu}^* - \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}_{\\\\mathbf{y}^*\\\\mathbf{y}} \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{y} - \\\\mathbf{\\\\mu}\\\\right) In the context of Gaussian models, especially in geostatistics, prediction using the best predictor, i.e. mean conditional on the data, is also known as kriging. The most computationally expensive component of the best predictor formula is inverting the covariance matrix \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}, which has cubic complexity \\\\mathcal{O}(n^3). Similarly, evaluating likelihood involves both calculating \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^{-1} and the determinant \\\\det(\\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}) which has the same cubic complexity. Gaussian process approximations can often be expressed in terms of assumptions on y under which \\\\log\\\\ell(\\\\mathbf{y}) and \\\\mathbf{\\\\mu}^*_\\\\mathbf{y} can be calculated with much lower complexity. Since these assumptions are generally not believed to reflect reality, the likelihood and the best predictor obtained in this way are not exact, but they are meant to be close to their original values.  Model-based methods  This class of approximations is expressed through a set of assumptions which are imposed on the original process and which, typically, imply some special structure of the covariance matrix. Although most of these methods were developed independently, most of them can be expressed as special cases of the sparse general Vecchia approximation.  Sparse covariance methods  These methods approximate the true model in a way the covariance matrix is sparse. Typically, each method proposes its own algorithm that takes the full advantage of the sparsity pattern in the covariance matrix. Two prominent members of this class of approaches are covariance tapering and domain partitioning. The first method generally requires a metric d over \\\\mathcal{X} and assumes that for X, \\\\tilde{X} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X} we have Cov(y(X), y(\\\\tilde{X}))=0 only if d(X, \\\\tilde{X}) for some radius r. The second method assumes that there exist \\\\mathcal{X}^{(1)}, \\\\dots, \\\\mathcal{X}^{(K)} such that \\\\bigcup_{k=1}^K\\\\mathcal{X}^{(k)}. Then with appropriate distribution of indices among partition elements and ordering of elements of X the covariance matrix is block diagonal.  Sparse precision methods  This family of methods assumes that the precision matrix \\\\mathbf{\\\\Lambda} = \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^{-1} is sparse and generally specifies which of its elements are non-zero. This leads to fast inversion because only those elements need to be calculated. Some of the prominent approximations in this category include the approach based on the equivalence between Gaussian processes with Matern covariance function and stochastic PDEs, periodic embedding, and Nearest Neighbour Gaussian processes. The first method applies to the case of d=2 and when \\\\mathcal{X} has a defined metric and takes advantage of the fact, that the Markov property holds which makes \\\\mathbf{\\\\Lambda} very sparse. The second extends the domain and uses Discrete Fourier Transform to decorrelate the data, which results in a diagonal precision matrix. The third one requires a metric on \\\\mathcal{X} and takes advantage of the so-called screening effect assuming that \\\\mathbf{\\\\Lambda}_{i,j} eq 0 only if d(x_i, x_j) < r, for some r>0.  Sparse Cholesky factor methods  In many practical applications, calculating \\\\mathbf{\\\\Lambda} is replaced with computing first \\\\mathbf{L}, the Cholesky factor of \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}, and second its inverse \\\\mathbf{L}^{-1}. This is known to be more stable than a plain inversion. For this reason, some authors focus on constructing a sparse approximation of the Cholesky factor of the precision or covariance matrices. One of the most established methods in this class is the Vecchia approximation and its generalization. These approaches determine the optimal ordering of indices and, consequently, the elements of \\\\mathbf{x} and then assume a dependency structure which minimizes in-fill in the Cholesky factor. Several other methods can be expressed in this framework, the Multi-resolution Approximation (MRA), Nearest Neighbour Gaussian Process, Modified Predictive Process and Full-scale approximation.  Low-rank methods  While this approach encompasses many methods, the common assumption underlying them all is the assumption, that y, the Gaussian process of interest, is effectively low-rank. More precisely, it is assumed, that there exists a set of indices \\\\bar{X} = {\\\\bar{x}_1, \\\\dots, \\\\bar{x}_p} such that every other set of indices X = {x_1, \\\\dots, x_n} y(X) \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A}_X\\\\bar{\\\\mathbf{\\\\mu}}, \\\\mathbf{A}_X^{\\\\top}\\\\bar{\\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}}\\\\mathbf{A}_X + \\\\mathbf{D}\\\\right) where \\\\mathbf{A}_X is an p \\\\times k matrix, \\\\bar{\\\\mathbf{\\\\mu}} = \\\\mu\\\\left(y\\\\left(\\\\bar{X}\\\\right)\\\\right) and \\\\bar{\\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}} = K\\\\left(\\\\bar{X}, \\\\bar{X}\\\\right) and \\\\mathbf{D} is a diagonal matrix. Depending on the method and application various ways of selecting \\\\bar{X} have been proposed. Typically, p is selected to be much smaller than n which means that the computational cost of inverting \\\\bar{\\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}} is manageable (\\\\mathcal{O}(p^3) instead of \\\\mathcal{O}(n^3)). More generally, on top of selecting \\\\bar{X}, one may also find an n \\\\times p matrix \\\\mathbf{A} and assume that X = \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{\\\\eta}, where \\\\mathbf{\\\\eta} are p values of a Gaussian process possibly independent of x. Many machine learning methods fall into this category, such as subset-of-regressors (SoR), relevance vector machine, sparse spectrum Gaussian Process and others and they generally differ in the way they derive \\\\mathbf{A} and \\\\mathbf{\\\\eta}.  Hierarchical methods  The general principle of hierarchical approximations consists of a repeated application of some other method, such that each consecutive application refines the quality of the approximation. Even though they can be expressed as a set of statistical assumptions, they are often described in terms of a hierarchical matrix approximation (HODLR) or basis function expansion (LatticeKrig, MRA, wavelets). The hierarchical matrix approach can often be represented as a repeated application of a low-rank approximation to successively smaller subsets of the index set X. Basis function expansion relies on using functions with compact support. These features can then be exploited by an algorithm who steps through consecutive layers of the approximation. In the most favourable settings some of these methods can achieve quasi-linear (\\\\mathcal{O}(n\\\\log n)) complexity.  Unified framework  Probabilistic graphical models provide a convenient framework for comparing model-based approximations. In this context, value of the process at index x_k \\\\in X can then be represented by a vertex in a directed graph and edges correspond to the terms in the factorization of the joint density of y(X). In general, when no independece relations are assumed, the joint probability distribution can be represented by an arbitrary directed acyclic graph. Using a particular approximation can then be expressed as a certain way of ordering the vertices and adding or removing specific edges.  Methods without a statistical model  This class of methods does not specify a statistical model or impose assumptions on an existing one. Three major members of this group are the meta-kriging algorithm, the gapfill algorithm and Local Approximate Gaussian Process approach. The first one partitions the set of indices into K components \\\\mathcal{X}^{(1)}, \\\\dots, \\\\mathcal{X}^{(k)}, calculates the conditional distribution for each those components separately and then uses geometric median of the conditional PDFs to combine them. The second is based on quantile regression using values of the process which are close to the value one is trying to predict, where distance is measured in terms of a metric on the set of indices. Local Approximate Gaussian Process uses a similar logic but constructs a valid stochastic process based on these neighboring values.

Dedicated to social welfare projects, as her mother had been, she opened a furniture manufacturing business to preserve the local hand-crafted canvases made in Romagna. In 1918, she met openly-lesbian writer and suffragist, Lina Poletti. The two women would share their lives for the next 40 years, traveling throughout Europe and Asia and studying philosophy and theosophy. Early life Eugenia Rasponi Murat was born on 18 September 1873 in Ravenna, in the Romagna region of the Kingdom of Italy to Princess Costanza (Constan»õa) Ghica and . She was the youngest of four surviving children. Her paternal grandparents were Count and Princess Luisa Giulia Murat and her paternal great-grandparents were Joachim Murat, King of Naples and Caroline Bonaparte, sister of Napoleon. Her maternal grandparents were Maria VƒÉcƒÉrescu and Costache Ghica of Wallachia, and her great grandfather was the poet . Within a month of her birth, her parents moved from Ravenna to Palermo, where her father assumed the post of prefect. He died when she was four years old. After her husband's death, Rasponi's mother returned to Ravenna and participated in social welfare programs. She was president of the Societ√† Operaia Femminile (Female Worker's Society), which she helped found in 1880. In 1894, she led the drive for the creation of a committee of the Red Cross in Ravenna and became first president of the organization. She died the following year, having impressed upon her daughter the importance of humanitarian service. Career In 1903, Rasponi purchased the castle fortress, known locally as the Castello Malatestiano, of Santarcangelo di Romagna, where she managed a furniture manufacturing facility. Interested in the local craft which produced hand-printed canvases, she purchased them as adornments for the castle and for use as the featured upholstery on her furniture. Rasponi became a prominent suffragist in Ravenna, and participated in the 1908 convention in Rome of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Donne Italiane (National Council of Italian Women, CNDI) led by her cousin, Gabriella Rasponi Spalletti. Around 1918, Rasponi met Cordula Poletti known as \\"Lina\\". Poletti was both a suffragist and openly lesbian. Sharing their hometown, their political views, and an appreciation of the arts, the two women became a couple. They lived in the Palazzo Rasponi Murat in Ravenna and in 1921 hosted the CNDI congress at the palace. The openness of Rasponi and Poletti's relationship was not accepted by the community and after the conference, the women decided to close the factory and move together to Rome. In 1922, Poletti gave a large portion of the family heirlooms from the Napoleonic era to her cousin Count Gian Battista Spelletti. After a 30-year closure, she reopened the rooms in the Palazzo in Ravenna which housed the remainder of the museum- quality artifacts, which included portraits of King Murat and Caroline Bonaparte by Fran√ßois G√©rard and numerous landscape paintings. She continued her activism in striving for equal rights of individuals, living with a group of similarly minded friends at her various residences. When in Rome, Rasponi and Poletti lived on Via Giovanni Battista Morgagni and became involved in several intellectual salons. They attended theosophical and philosophical meetings, which brought them to the attention of authorities. As a result, their home was repeatedly raided by the police. In one incident from 1937, they organized seminars for Jiddu Krishnamurti, an anti-fascist philosopher. He gave a series of presentations in February and March at Rasponi's home on spiritual matters and the police interrupted the meeting, accusing Krishnamurti of preparing political initiatives. Supporters of Krishnamurti wrote letters to the government expressing that Potetti and Rasponi fully supported the government and that Krishnamurti was apolitical. Eventually the charges were dropped. The couple traveled widely throughout Europe and Asia, making long study trips to gather anthropological and esoteric answers to existential dilemmas. Death and legacy Rasponi died in 1958, having partnered with Poletti for 40 years. She is widely credited with rescuing the hand-painted canvas craft in Romagna from extinction. Having no children, Rasponi left her estate to her cousin, Count Gian \\"Giovanni\\" Battista Spalletti Trivelli, son of Gabriella. In turn the Rocca Malatestiana Santarcangelo was inherited by Princess Marina Colonna di Paliano, who restored and reopened it to the public in 2019. Her apartment in the Palazzo Rasponi Murat was preserved after her death as a museum and could be viewed by the public on appointment through 2012.

It is native to southeastern Asia but has spread to other parts of the world, including Australia, South America, southern Europe and the United States. Description Barbronia weberi grows to a body length of about , with individuals becoming sexually mature from a length of about . The body is about wide and the rear suction cup has a diameter of approximately . The body surface is covered with tiny papillae and is a uniform red to dark reddish- brown colour, sometimes almost black. There are always three pairs of eyespots on the head. The segments are not externally recognizable, and the seventeen body segments each comprise five outer annulations. In the pharynx, there are one or two retractile stylets on each of the three jaws. Between the male and female sex opening of the hermaphrodite animals there are five or fewer annulations. On the ventral surface, there is a central accessory copulation pore next to the gonopores, but this is absent in young animals. Distribution and habitat The species is native to India, southeastern Asia, the Philippines and Indonesia. From here it has spread to Australia, Europe and South America. It is a freshwater species. In 2018 it was reported from two widely separated locations in North Carolina, but it is unclear whether these are as a result of two different introductions, or mean that the leech has become widely distributed but has previously been overlooked. Ecology As is the case with all leeches, B. weberi is a hermaphrodite; sperm is passed from one individual to another by traumatic insemination. The eggs are fertilised and a cocoon is secreted by the clitellum and receives the from one to five eggs as it passes over the female gonopore. The eggs hatch in about one month and the juvenile leeches that emerge become mature in about four months. The adult can produce weekly cocoons for about three months before becoming senescent. Adults are often found attached to water plants, and the cocoons containing eggs are attached to rocks, submerged objects or aquatic vegetation at the base of leaf whorls; it seems likely that the transport of aquatic plants by the aquarium trade is the means by which the leech has dispersed to new locations. This leech can be successfully reared egg to egg in the laboratory, and may be of use as a model organism in developmental studies.

Background A foal of 1944, Miss Disco was bred by Alfred Vanderbilt Jr. at his Sagamore Farm in Reisterstown, Maryland. Miss Disco's dam was stakes winner Outdone, a daughter of the 1925 Belmont Futurity winner, Pompey. As a result of her breeding, she is a full sister to Loser Weeper, whose wins include the 1949 Metropolitan and 1950 Suburban Handicaps. During World War II Alfred Vanderbilt was serving with the United States Navy and as such it was necessary for him to sell off some of his yearlings. Among those sold was Miss Disco who was purchased by Sydney Schupper for $2,100 from a 1945 New York auction. Racing career Like her brother Loser Weeper, Miss Disco was a durable horse and while not uncommon in that era, she made 54 starts. First raced as a two-year-old, in stakes events Miss Disco ran third in the four and one-half furlong Fashion Stakes won by First Flight and third to winner Royal Governor in the six-furlong Babylon Handicap. As a three-year- old, she began to develop into a legitimate competitor at Sprint race distances, winning the six-furlong Can't Wait Stakes and the Test Stakes at seven furlongs. At age four, Miss Disco won the Interborough and New Rochelle Handicaps at six furlongs and the American Legion Handicap at seven. Miss Disco's owner, Sydney Schupper, kept her racing at ages five and six. During this time, her full brother Loser Weeper was winning a good deal of top races, which enhanced her value as a prospective broodmare. Broodmare With her pending retirement from racing, Claiborne Farm owner Bull Hancock advised his client Gladys Phipps to purchase Miss Disco for breeding. Hancock believed the mare would be an ideal mate for Nasrullah, the Irish-bred stallion he and his partners had recently imported. Nasrullah, who went to lead the North American sire list five times, was the son of the great Italian-bred Nearco, who was undefeated in all fourteen starts. In turn, Nearco sired Nearctic, the 1958 Canadian Horse of the Year whose son Northern Dancer was the 20th century's greatest sire. Miss Disco was first bred to Rosemont. This mating produced the 1951 filly Hill Rose. who was bred in 1965 to Northern Dancer in his first season at stud. From this match came the very good gelded runner True North, whose wins for owner Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney included the rich 1971 Widener Handicap. The following year, Miss Disco was bred to Nasrullah. The resulting foal was a colt named Independence, who had success in steeplechase racing, including a win in the prestigious American Grand National. Bred again to Nasrullah, Miss Disco produced a 1953 filly named Explorer who won six minor races from nineteen starts. Her offspring met with modest success in racing and at stud. Miss Disco's fourth foal, and third by Nasrullah, was a son who not only earned American Horse of the Year honors and was inducted into the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame but became a stallion that ranks among the upper echelon of successful sires in all of Thoroughbred racing. An eight-time leading sire in North America, Bold Ruler was the sire of eleven National Champions including U.S. Triple Crown winner Secretariat. Bold Ruler was also a sire of sires whose lineage counts Ruffian and numerous other racing greats. Seven further foals were born to Miss Disco between 1955 and 1965, of which four were unraced. Her daughter Foolish One (1957) produced Funny Fellow (1965), a good stayer noted for having only one eye that won multiple top- level races including the Lawrence Realization Stakes and the Roamer, Gallant Fox, and Donn Handicaps. Foolish One was also the dam of Protanto (1967), a multiple stakes winner from age two through four and the sire of San Juan Capistrano Stakes winner Properantes. The remainder of Miss Disco's foals did not enhance the bloodline.

Early life  Kelly is originally from the Chicago area and is a 1997 graduate of Saint Xavier University as well as a 1998 graduate of Boston University.  Career  Kelly began her career at the Daily Herald and subsequently the Chicago Reporter. While in Illinois, Kelly hosted a public-affairs show on WFLD -Channel 32 and a weekly radio show on Chicago Public Media WBEZ 91.5-FM. Kelly then worked in Washington, DC as an investigative reporter at the Washington Post, where she became an expert in public records requests and Freedom of Information Act requests. In 2019, Kelly left the Post to become the deputy editor for Enterprise and Investigations in the Washington Bureau of the Los Angeles Times. In that role, Kelly leads a team of five reporters focused on policy and issues of public record. Kelly is also a visiting lecturer in the Humanities Council and Ferris professor of journalism at Princeton University.  Fatal Force project  While at the Post, Kelly worked on the \\"Fatal Force\\" project, a database that tracked 990 police shootings in 2015. At the time, neither the federal government nor state governments had comprehensive, nationwide data on police killings. Drawing on databases put together by nonprofit groups as well as local newspaper reports, law enforcement websites and social media, Lowery and colleagues built out the Post's Fatal Force database. Kelly was one of 70 staffers from multiple departments assembled the database and compiled stories, photos, data, graphics, and videos about trends revealed by the information. The Post has continued to update its database since its founding.  Pulitzer Prize  The Fatal Force project, on which Kelly was one of the lead authors (also see Wesley Lowery), won the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting in 2016, and the Justice Department announced a pilot program to begin collecting a more comprehensive set of use-of-force statistics in 2017. Kelly found out about the 2016 win when she was on her honeymoon in Aruba. She coauthored the first story in the series and did the necessary data analysis of two decades of police prosecutions. Kelly explained that the project \\"raised greater accountability in how statistics nationally are kept and prompted an overhaul of those efforts. I‚Äôm proud that I got to be a part of something that makes a difference.\\" Kelly was also nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 2019 for her work at the Los Angeles Times.

The 40-year-old was a mother of five. The Forsyth County Sheriff department initially ruled the death an accident, stating that the \\"multiple blunt force injuries\\" were related to Horsford likely falling from the balcony due to \\"acute ethanol intoxication\\". A second autopsy requested by her family, however, revealed further abrasions to her body. The family's attorney also stated that lack of evidence, types of injuries discovered, and mismatched witness accounts strongly suggested homicide. On February 20, 2019, Major Joe Perkins of the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office announced that the case would be closed and that there was no evidence of foul play. The case did not receive public recognition until 2 months after her death, when one of the witnesses was fired from his county court officer job for internally accessing the incident report. The case, along with the hashtag #tamlahorsford, quickly spread around the internet, along with suspicion of foul play. In the summer of 2020, the nationwide protests against racism and police brutality sparked by George Floyd's murder renewed public interest and advocacy of the case. Under the pressure of public outcry, including posts from celebrities such as T.I. and 50 Cent, the Forsyth County Sheriff requested that the case be reopened and investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.  Death  Horsford arrived at the slumber party at 10p.m. on November 3, 2018. Attendees drank, watched football, and played Cards Against Humanity. There were also three men at the house. According to witnesses, Horsford got up at 2a.m. to go smoke a cigarette on the back porch. The next morning at 7:30a.m., the homeowner's aunt found Horsford lying facedown and motionless under the porch. At 8:59a.m., Jose Barrera, the homeowner's boyfriend, called 9-1-1. In the 9-1-1 call, Barrera described Horsford as lying facedown and not breathing. He brought attention to a small cut on her wrist, suggesting that it may be self-inflicted. A woman's voice can also be heard on the call speculating that Horsford might have fallen from the balcony. The police arrived at 9:07 am.  Initial investigation  The initial autopsy ordered by the Forsyth Sheriff's Office discovered \\"multiple blunt force injuries\\" and a high blood alcohol level. Officials speculated that the latter caused her to fall from the porch and that the injuries were just a result of the 14 foot fall. Horsford's family and friends, however, were not convinced and called for a second independent autopsy, which was then carried out by the Georgia Bureau of Investigations (GBI). According to the GBI medical examiners report, Horsford sustained severe injuries to her head, neck, and torso. They discovered cuts on her face, wrist, hand, and lower legs and well as a \\"laceration to the right ventricle\\" of her heart. The GBI toxicology screening found a blood alcohol level of .238 and traces of THC and Alprazolam (an anxiety drug) at the time of her death. Even before the results of the autopsy, speculation of foul play had begun to spread online. This was prompted, two months after Horsford's death, by Forsyth County Court firing Barrera, then a court officer, for accessing the incident report internally on multiple occasions. Hundreds of people shared the hashtag #tamlahorsford, questioning different angles of the case and calling for justice. The case was officially closed on February 20, 2019 ruled as an accidental death. Major Joe Perkins of the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office stated that none of Horsford's injuries aligned with foul play, saying, \\"It was a party. They were drinking. She was drinking. Most of the partygoers had gone to bed at that time, and she was on the deck alone.\\" He had interviewed 30 people, including family, friends, and other partygoers.  Renewed public interest  After fading from the public eye, Horsford's death became a topic of advocacy again during the George Floyd anti-police brutality protests of 2020. On June 5, 2020, Ralph E. Fernandez, the Horsford family attorney, wrote a letter to Horsford's husband, Leander Horsford, claiming that his team's investigation into the details of the case strongly suggested homicide. It said, in part: \\"Witness statements are in conflict. A potential subject handled the body as well as the evidence prior to law enforcement arriving. Evidence was disposed of and no inquiry followed. The scene was not preserved.\\" He also stated that Horsford's injuries were \\"consistent\\" with those of a physical struggle, but that the absence of photos from the initial autopsy prevented a definite conclusion. An Atlanta journalist published the letter a few days later. Horsford's name and case spread across the internet, starting with protestors in Cumming, GA who included her name on their signs alongside the names of Black Americans murdered by the police in recent years. A Change.org petition calling for the case to be reopened amassed more than 586,000 signatures and rappers T.I. and 50 Cent shared posts about the case, asking for a second investigation.  Second investigation  On June 12, 2020 Forsyth County Sheriff Ron Freeman sent a letter requesting that the case be re-opened and investigated by the GBI. He stated that the investigation was best undertaken by an independent law enforcement agency. The GBI agreed to reopen the case on June 18, 2020, but did not specify when the investigation would begin.

It was his last complete piano duet sonata for one piano, four hands. This sonata consists of three movements: Allegro, Andante and Allegretto. Dedication and context In Mozart's thematic catalog, the piece was dated May 29, 1787. On that same day, he also received word of his father's death. Mozart then shared the sad news with his close friend Gottfried von Jacquin, a Viennese court official and amateur musician, and subsequently dedicated the piece to Gottfried's sister, Franziska von Jacquin. In Mozart's letter to Gottfried, he noted that the piece is \\"rather difficult\\" and therefore instructed Franziska to \\"tackle it at once\\". This piece was published at the turn of the year 1787/1788 by music publisher Franz Anton Hoffmeister. Instead of Mozart's original intention to dedicate it to Franziska von Jacquin, one of his most talented pupils, it was dedicated to Nanette and Barbette Natrop, daughters of Viennese businessman Franz Wilhelm Natorp, also in the Jacquin circle. Movements=I. Allegro (C major)  Opening measures of Primo The first movement begins with the Primo and Secondo parts playing in unison, presenting the main theme with both vigor and delicacy. After the initial phrase, follows an tasteful and refined dialog between Primo and Secondo. A gracious second theme comes after the sixteenth note descending scales and a slight pause at the end of the first theme. II. Andante (F major) This slow and melancholic second movement takes a ternary form of A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA. The outer sections (A sections) bear a lyrical and gentle quality, while the middle section (B section) has difficult triplets runs that give a rather tense feeling. III. Allegretto (C major) The third movement is a rondo. Its main theme begins with a relaxed \\"music-box naivety\\" full of glamour and humor.

It contains 30 tracks, containing remastered versions of Guaraldi's complete recorded output for Warner Bros.-Seven Arts (Oh Good Grief!, The Eclectic Vince Guaraldi, Alma-Ville), plus four bonus tracks. Background Vince Guaraldi's final three albums released during his lifetime were recorded for Warner Bros.-Seven Arts after spending considerable time struggling to extricate himself from Fantasy Records. Warner signed Guaraldi to a three-record deal, and insisted that his inaugural release consist of his Peanuts songs. This was done in part to help fill the void left by a lack of soundtrack albums to accompany the successful television specials, Charlie Brown's All Stars!, It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, You're in Love, Charlie Brown and He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown. Guaraldi responded with new renditions of eight of his most popular scores from those programs on his first release, Oh Good Grief!. Guaraldi was then given complete artistic control over his sophomore, self-produced Warner effort, The Eclectic Vince Guaraldi, resulting in an unfocused and overindulgent album that was not well received by both critics and consumers. At Warner's insistence, arranger Shorty Rogers was recruiter to produce Guaraldi's final album, Alma-Ville. Though deemed a focused improvement over the previous album, Warner lost interest in Guaraldi and did not promote the album. Both The Eclectic Vince Guaraldi and Alma-Ville fell into obscurity, with Oh Good Grief! remaining in print and a steady seller due to the perpetual popularity of the Peanuts franchise. Production The Complete Warner Bros.‚ÄìSeven Arts Recordings was compiled by prestige label Omnivore Recordings and produced by Grammy Award-winning Cheryl Pawelski. Pawelski recruited audio archivist Michael Graves (who worked on previous Guaraldi remastering efforts) to perform a high-definition 24-bit mix.

She was the first African American school principal in Honolulu. Lai, an African American from New York, worked as a teacher and educational leader at a time when these occupations were largely closed to African Americans on the U. S. mainland, and she achieved professional success at a time when African Americans represented only 0.2 percent of the population of Hawaii.  Early life  1907 photo of (from left to right) Carlotta Stewart Lai's brother, McCants Stewart, along with his daughter Mary Katherine Stewart, Carlotta Stewart Lai (standing), McCants Stewart's wife Mayme Delia Weir (seated), and McCants Stewart's sister-in-law Harriett Anna Weir. Lai was born in 1881 in Brooklyn, New York to Thomas McCants Stewart and Charlotte L. Harris Stewart. She was the third child and the only daughter, and she attended public school in Brooklyn. Her brothers, McCants Stewart and Gilchrist Stewart, both became attorneys. Her father, Thomas McCants Stewart, was an attorney and writer in New York, who was also involved in party politics in the field of voting rights. Her mother was a graduate of Wilberforce University. Lai's maternal aunt was Verina Morton-Jones, an physician, charter founder of the Brooklyn NAACP, and co-founder of the Urban League. When she was 18 years old in 1898, she moved to Hawai'i with her father and stepmother. Her father decided to move the family to Hawai'i in hopes of furthering his legal career. He was able to develop his legal practice advocating for \\"all varieties of people in diverse Honolulu,‚Äù and helped draft Honolulu's City Charter. Carlotta Stewart Lai, ca. 1900 When her father left Hawaii in 1905, Lai remained and never again returned to the U.S. mainland. Despite not having her family with her in Hawai'i, Lai had a vibrant social life with close friends and involvement in activities such as dances, parties, baseball games, and vacations. Scholars postulate that this social involvement, along with her professional progress and ability to \\"reside openly in an integrated community,\\" may have been some reasons why Lai decided to remain in Hawai'i.  Education  Lai attended Oahu College (now Punahou School) for one year where she participated in the school's literary society and played on the girls' basketball team. In 1902, she earned a Normal School teaching certification, which qualified her to teach in Hawai'i's public schools.  Career  Lai began her teaching career at Sacred Hearts Convent.Hornsby, Alton, editor. Black America: A State-by- State Historical Encyclopedia, vol. 1, Greenwood, 2011. ABC-CLIO, publisher.abc-clio.com/EGR4112, p. 222. In 1909, when she was 28 years old, Lai was principal of Ko'olau Elementary School in Kauai, where she taught children from many different races and ethnic backgrounds. This achievement has been described as \\"striking for a Black woman in a society where Blacks had no political influence... or where few Blacks resided.\\" In 1933, Lai became principal of Hanamaulu School, now the site of King Kaumualii Elementary School in Kauai. At Hanamaulu School, Lai was not only the principal, but she also supervised the library and cafeteria, and taught English. Lai attended professional conferences of the Hawai'i Education Association and the Kaua'i Education Association. She retired from teaching in 1944, after 41 years of service with the Hawaii Department of Education.  Personal  In 1916, Lai married Yun Tim Lai, a car salesman of Chinese descent who was born in 1886 in Kauai. Lai was close friends with her sister- in-law, Ruth Aki Ching, who was later named as the executor and a benefactor of her will. Lai's husband died unexpectedly in 1935 during a visit to Hong Kong. They had no children, and she did not remarry. Lai died at the Manoa Convalescent Home on July 6, 1952. Correspondence and other papers related to Lai's family history is archived at Howard University, pursuant to a donation by Katherine Stewart Flippin, Lai's niece and longtime special education teacher in San Francisco, California.

Lizzie Bowser lived in Philadelphia's Twelfth Ward with her husband David Bustill Bowser, with whom she ran a successful business. The couple manufactured memorabilia, regalia, and decorative objects for the many voluntary associations in the area. Their clients included African-American fraternal organizations like the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows, volunteer fire brigades, and American Civil War relief organizations.

The couple held a prominent position in Philadelphia's African-American society, and were known for their philanthropic contributions to charitable organizations. Their giving served an activist purpose; many of the groups they supported were meant to advance the social position of African-Americans, and compensate for the frequent exclusion of Black communities from public disaster relief. Bowser was a member of the Household of Ruth, the women's branch of the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows. She was also an active member of the Ladies' Union Association of Philadelphia, a charitable organization founded during the Civil War by free Black women. The Ladies' Union Association raised money to provide relief for formerly enslaved people and support for Black soldiers returning from war. Through her work with these organizations, Bowser became friends with diarist Emilie Frances Davis, with whom she socialized and attended Bible study classes. Bowser would often arrange sales of her husband's artworks to benefit the fundraising efforts of relief organizations. In May 1865, she raised $1200 in sales to benefit the Ladies' Union Association.  Personal life  Bowser and her husband had three children: Mary, Raphael, and Ida. Raphael Bowser followed his father's path and became a painter; Ida Elizabeth Bowser Asbury became a violinist and music teacher, and was the first African American woman to earn a degree from the University of Pennsylvania Elizabeth Harriet Stevens Gray Bowser is buried in Eden Cemetery, in Collingdale, Pennsylvania.

It is a song sung by women on the festival of Deepawali. Sua means 'parrot'. Sua is a bird that speaks rote things. In this folklore, women sing songs conveying messages through parrots. Through this song, women express their heart's feelings with the belief that Sua (the parrot) will convey the agony of their heart to their lover. Therefore, it is sometimes called the 'Viyog' song.This folk song is sung with great enthusiasm at the time of paddy harvesting. In this, the marriage of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati is celebrated, making earthen Gaura-Gauri and moving around it and singing sua songs and making sua dance. In some places, this song is sung by making earthen Sua (parrot). It starts a few days before Divali and ends with the marriage of Shiva-Parvati (Gaura-Gauri) on Diwali. This is considered to be the adherent song. This song, sung for years, is oral. In the song Sua, women place a sua, that is, a parrot statue, over a paddy filled with bamboo baskets and dance around them in a circular position. There are two idols of parrot in a basket filled with paddy. Women sing the Sua song by addressing them. The girl holding the basket on her head is called Suggi. Sua dance is usually initiated in the evening. Women gather at a certain place in the village where this basket is covered with red cloth. After lifting the basket in the head, one of the women of the party walks and puts it in the middle of the courtyard of the farmers' house. The women of the party are round about him. The cloth is removed from the basket and the lamp is lit and danced. In Chhattisgarh, no musical instrument is used in this song dance. The song is sung by women in applause.

The song ends with dialogue from former KKK leader Jeff Berry's speech during a rally, which was featured in the 1998 documentary The Ku Klux Klan: A Secret History: \\"We see, I see, death before the children / White guys and white girls hanging from the buildings\\". The original song sampled more of the speech. Music video The track was featured in the music video for X's 2015 track \\"Look at Me\\".

Privacy settings allow a person to control what information is shared on these platforms. Many social networking services (SNS) such as Facebook, have default privacy settings that leave users more prone to sharing personal information. Privacy settings are contributed to by users, companies, and external forces. Contributing factors that influence user activity in privacy settings include the privacy paradox and the third person effect. The third person effect explains why privacy settings can remain unchanged throughout time. Companies can enforce a Principle of Reciprocity (PoR) where users have to decide what information they are willing to share in exchange for others‚Äô information. With the growing focus on internet privacy, there are technologies and programs designed to enhance and encourage more privacy setting activity. Applications such as the Personal Data Manager (PDM) are used to improve the efficiency of privacy setting management. Privacy by design can enhance privacy settings through incorporating privacy notifications or prompting users to occasionally manage their privacy settings.  Significance  See also: Internet privacy & Information privacy SNS are designed to connect people together online. Users share information and build relationships online. Privacy leaks can still occur even with privacy settings intact. Users‚Äô connections on SNS can reveal personal information such as having friends from the same university can lead to an inference that a person attends that university. Furthermore, even if a person has strict privacy settings enabled, their privacy can still be leaked through their connections who may not have as many privacy settings in place. This calls for enhanced privacy settings that can tolerate different privacy settings while allowing online connections. The ability to control who views their content influences users‚Äô decision to share or not share images on SNS such as WeChat or Qzone. Different communities call for different levels of privacy. For example, an individual is more likely to share a photo of themselves and a close friend with their close friend circle and family than strangers. This reveals a need for fine privacy settings that allow users more flexibility in their SNS sharing ability. Hu Xiaoxu et al. suggests privacy settings should encourage social networking on SNS while simultaneously protecting user privacy.  Default settings  Main article: Default effect alt= Privacy settings for SNS have default settings that set up users to automatically share personal information the user has inputted. For example, Twitter users are automatically prone to a public profile when an account is first made. Furthermore, SNS privacy policies have shown to be too complex for consumers to fully understand, leading to personal information being shared regardless of user awareness. Even after a user deletes their Facebook profile, Facebook can still use and sell user information according to their privacy policy.Facebook's default settings allow friends to view a person's profile and anyone to search for one's profile. Default settings can be chosen due to their convenience; users do not have to exert as much effort to choose default settings compared to personalizing privacy settings.  Users' role in privacy settings = Theories  Privacy settings are situated in the framework of the communication privacy management theory. This theory states that privacy management involves setting boundaries and agreements with individuals, highlighting that once information is shared, it is now their information as well. In a study about teenagers and their privacy, it was revealed that privacy concerns was the biggest contributor to management both personal and interpersonal privacy (see Privacy concerns with social networking services). Privacy settings can be inaccessible or effortful to implement. Teenagers that feel fatalistic toward their personal privacy are more likely to depend on interpersonal privacy techniques. De Wolf's study revealed that teenagers used more personal privacy techniques than interpersonal privacy management, which emphasizes the need for accessible, clear privacy settings. Voluntary servitude is an idea that states people knowingly give their support to authoritative figures by subjecting themselves to servitude. In the sense of social media, voluntary servitude is how users expose their information to companies and perpetuate data collection and monetization. Romele et al. offers a possible explanation to voluntary servitude through the System Justification Theory. This theory states that people learn to internalize societal hierarchies and perpetuate their existence. Users are complying to the power hierarchy by allowing their information to be extracted from these companies, through methods such as sharing personal information with close family and friends which can be harvested by companies and third parties. The theory of planned behavior aligns beliefs, attitudes, norms and behavior together. In a study that surveyed undergraduate students on their Facebook use, a majority responded that when their close friends think privacy protection is important or engage in privacy protection activity, they are more likely to have intentions to also engage in privacy protection behavior.  Privacy paradox  See also: Privacy paradox By accepting privacy policies and therefore, agreeing to default settings set in place by companies, users are prone to oversharing information. However, users usually do not change their privacy settings unless they personally experience a privacy invasion or unintentionally share information. In a study exploring the connection between Facebook attitudes and behaviors, having a friend experience a privacy invasion (e.g. someone hacking into their profile) did not lead to one implementing privacy changes. A possible explanation for this is the third-person effect, which is the belief that one has a less chance of a privacy invasion than someone else, thinking they are safer than others. This protective mindset is flawed because anyone is susceptible to privacy invasions, and managing privacy settings can help decrease that risk. The privacy paradox is an idea that states individuals' privacy attitudes and beliefs do not match their privacy behavior. This concept offers an explanation to why individuals may be complacent in privacy setting management. The privacy paradox intertwines with the third-person effect because individuals believe privacy is important but do not believe a privacy-related incident will happen to them over others. Recognizing personal privacy as important is a low-cost effort, but actually taking measures to protect one‚Äôs privacy may be too high-cost for individuals, explaining the privacy paradox. An extension of the privacy paradox is the discrepancy between the nothing to hide claim and the use of privacy settings. In a study of Canadian teenage use of SNS, a majority of participants that claimed they had nothing to hide still utilized privacy settings such as blocking other users. Different selves were also portrayed across different SNS such as Facebook and Snapchat, which is a form of privacy in itself.  Influences  Another reason users do not alter their privacy settings is a lack of knowing these settings exist. Facebook users that know privacy settings exist are more likely to change them compared to users who do not know privacy settings exist. Furthermore, with Facebook, users explain their lack of privacy setting alteration because the choice to choose who is a Facebook friend is already a form of privacy. However, Debatin et al. emphasizes that the criteria individuals use to decide who is a Facebook friend is typically relaxed, posing privacy risks for users. In a different study, it was shown that the number of friends who had a private profile increased the likelihood that a user would adopt a private profile. Furthermore, the amount of time a person spent on Facebook and women were more likely to have a private profile. A private Facebook profile was defined as changing the default settings so non-friends cannot search for their profile. If the data is valuable, privacy is prevalent on the app, and implementing privacy settings is easy, users say they are more likely to engage in privacy behavior.  Updated privacy settings  In May 2020, Facebook began implementing the option to give users to delete or archive past posts from a certain time or from certain people. This \\"Manage Activity\\" option allows more security and privacy control for users. This tool is only accessible through the mobile app and has yet to be adapted to the web version of Facebook.  Companies' role in privacy settings = Policy design  Users are not the sole party involved in privacy. Companies are also responsible for implementing default privacy settings and creating options. Romele et al. acknowledges that social media companies often play a significant role in perpetuating the voluntary servitude of users. Social media privacy policies can be complex and default settings are set up to collect beneficial, profitable data to companies. In a study that examined Facebook's privacy policy from 2005 to 2015, Shore et al. found that the policy became increasingly unclear and unaccountable. A specific portion regarding the use of user personal data and third party involvement was found to be increasingly confusing. In addition to companies portraying their privacy protection as clear and beneficial for users, they also do not do anything to heighten awareness of constant data collection. An example of this is shown through Facebook ad preferences. Facebook users can have personalized ads on their feeds which Facebook portrays as a specialized, beneficial option for users but does not explicitly state that these ads largely benefit the companies and third parties involved.  Principle of reciprocity  Default settings put users on a specific trajectory regarding their privacy. The principle of reciprocity (PoR) is played out in terms of privacy and sociability on these networks. PoR is the concept that users who give their privacy receive application utility in return. In a WhatsApp study testing user privacy choices (see Reception and criticism of WhatsApp security and privacy features), users were interviewed regarding the Last Seen Online (LSO) and Read Receipt (RR) option. Participants revealed a higher preference for keeping the RR on than the LSO option. Individuals were more likely to share if they have read a message in exchange for their recipients' read status, an example of the principle of reciprocity. LSO was not as practical as RR because being online was not a direct translation to reading their messages. In the study, younger participants had LSO turned off, indicating that older participants were less likely to have restrictive privacy settings. This could be because older users have closer circle of contacts and/or they do not place as much emphasis on what they share. Designing privacy settings to be reciprocal force users to make a decision on what private information they are willing to exchange for others' private information.  Profit  SNS companies who want to increase revenue from advertisements can achieve this by increasing the number of users and retention rate. Lin et al. revealed that both informational and territorial privacy are user concerns with SNS. Territory coordination, the access to an individual‚Äôs virtual territory which can be a Facebook profile or a Twitter page, influences user privacy management more than informational disclosure. More fine-grain privacy settings are recommended by Lin et al. to better suit a wide collection of territorial and informational privacy preferences. By targeting user preferences and needs, companies can increase the number of users on their platforms and increase their revenue. This serves as a monetary motivation for companies to adjust their privacy settings to better support users.  External contributors in privacy settings = Culture  Cultural differences such as being in a collectivistic versus an individualistic society can influence the general privacy settings chosen by users. In a study that analyzed varying Twitter privacy behaviors across the globe, there appeared a cultural difference between countries. In this study, culture was measured through individualism and uncertainty avoidance. According to Hofstede's cultural dimensions, individualism is a heavy focus on the person while collectivism is more based on group effort. Uncertainty avoidance is how uncomfortable an individual is with the unknown. Collectivistic societies tend to be less individualistic and less avoidant of uncertainty while individualistic societies tend to be more individualistic and more avoidant of uncertainty. The results of this study show collectivistic cultural values support more permissiveness, as measured by sharing geographic location on a person‚Äôs profile. Privacy settings in collectivist communities supported more information sharing than in an individualistic community. The cultural differences between in group versus out group could also play a role in this relationship. Collectivistic societies, such as Japan or China, distinguish more between in group versus out group than their individualistic counterparts. Users in collectivistic countries typically keep a smaller inner circle, which fosters a more intimate, trusting environment for sharing personal information. On the other hand, individualistic societies such as the U.S. or Europe, typically keep a bigger social circle and in group and out group do not differ much. Internet penetration, the measure of how many people use to how many do not use the Internet in a country, predicted user privacy. In areas that had low internet penetration, users likely had private accounts but also did not conceal their location. This study reveals how cultural values and access to Internet can affect a person's privacy settings.  Societal norms  Societal norms can also contribute to privacy setting behavior. Close friends‚Äô own privacy behavior can influence a person's intentions to also participate in similar behavior. However, intentions may not always lead to action which was seen in Saeri et al.‚Äôs study. Two weeks after indicating intentions to engage in privacy protection behavior on a survey, most participants did nothing. An explanation lies in the habitual nature of using Facebook, making it difficult for some to change their behavior. Facebook also encourages users to share information which shapes norms that influence behavior. Norms serve a role in influencing privacy behavior.  Enhancements = Design  With the growing prevalence of social media, the risk for privacy leaks becomes more and more possible. Privacy settings can help protect users if designed and used in specific ways. Privacy settings could be re-designed with the intention of protecting the user as much as possible. This is called privacy by design. Privacy by design aims to limit the risks of information sharing while maintaining or possibly increasing the benefits. Privacy policies can be complex and unclear which serves as an obstacle to users understanding their privacy. Potential changes in privacy settings include simpler privacy policies that are concise, clear, and understood by the user. Incorporating reminders for users to check, and possibly update their privacy settings occasionally may increase privacy awareness. With default settings designed for users to keep an open profile, Watson et al. offered a different default setting design. Facebook default privacy settings could be altered to be more conservative (e.g. not being searchable by anyone on Facebook) to possibly prevent unintentional information sharing. However, utility needs to be balanced with default privacy settings. If default privacy settings were too strict and closed off, the functionality of social media apps could decrease. A balance between default privacy settings that protect the user from unwanted privacy leaks but also allow users to socialize and interact online should be considered. When first choosing privacy settings, it may be useful to choose from pre-made profiles that have varying levels of privacy in them. Sanchez et al.‚Äôs study revealed that profile examples accurately reflect user privacy preferences and beliefs; this limits the discrepancy between privacy beliefs and privacy behavior. Along with the profile examples, users could also manually change and adjust their privacy settings accordingly after. This keeps the privacy setting process flexible and more convenient than manually choosing each privacy setting option. Furthermore, a simulation tool that informs users about posts and comments‚Äô visibility can encourage users to use privacy settings more. Sayin et al. created a Facebook simulation tool that showed users how a post‚Äôs audience setting was going to affect comment owners and their privacy. For example, if a user commented on a post that was initially only viewable by friends but later changed to public, the user‚Äôs privacy is risked because Facebook does not notify users of this audience change. 95% of participants that used the simulation tool believed that this tool would help increase Facebook privacy awareness.  Software  Anytime a new connection is made on a social media app, users could be prompted to set privacy settings for that specific individual. This may be tedious and too effortful for some users to use effectively. However, this can be balanced with the assistance of software tools such as a personal data manager. These softwares can be used to take into account user's privacy wants, and apply appropriate privacy settings that match these preferences to an individual's accounts. However, more research needs to be conducted to make sure these softwares can accurately apply privacy preferences to privacy settings. Personal data managers have the potential to help users become more involved in their privacy and lessen the effort for setting privacy controls. Another software, AID-S (Adaptive Inference Discovery Service) personalizes each user‚Äôs privacy preferences since what is considered private information varies from each individual. Torre et al. found that AID-S can be used to find a user‚Äôs preferred privacy settings and help users make more informed decisions regarding privacy including third party inclusion. Furthermore, a framework was created for smart home information processing that includes a two layer security that improves user privacy. This framework incorporates user privacy preferences, similar to the personal data manager, and uses Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Top Three Most Significant Bit (TTMSB) to safely transmit data from smart home devices. TTMSB takes into account user privacy desires and conceals sensitive information during data transmission. Data science is a field that has been used to extract inferred information from databases of collected SNS user information. However, the ability to infer information from data science can be used to better inform users on how their information can be used and increase informed privacy decisions. Control over one‚Äôs privacy and transparency on how their information will be used can help facilitate a relationship between data science and privacy.  Trust-based negotiations  Trust-based negotiations are based on a contingency of acceptance or rejection from the user. In respect to privacy, trust-based negotiations have been offered as a diversion from the binary of accepting or rejecting privacy policies in full, and allow acceptance and rejection of specific parts of the privacy policies. This allows users to have more control over their privacy and allow interaction between the two parties. The general data protection regulation (GDPR) ensures that third parties (TPs) are using concise, clear language in their privacy policies while the user also gives a clear response of acceptance or rejection to them. There must be a consensual agreement between the user and the TPs. If either side is unsatisfied with the privacy terms, they can negotiate. PDM plays a major role in this by mediating between the user and the TP. PDM applies the user‚Äôs privacy preferences to the TP‚Äôs privacy statements and either accepts or rejects it based on the user‚Äôs preferences. If there is a rejection, both parties can enter negotiation. The advancement of an interactive privacy model attempts to make privacy settings a one-time action that will be applied to all Internet of things (IoT).  Interactive educational games  See also: Educational game The privacy paradox is contributed by lack of privacy knowledge, fatigue, and feeling distant from a privacy invasion. Education and increasing intrinsic motivation can help alleviate the effect of these contributors, and in turn, the privacy paradox. However, in a study that tested the effectiveness of an interactive privacy smartwatch game, game players were more likely to engage in privacy behavior such as enabling a lock screen. The game was personalized where users could create their own avatar and had to complete time-sensitive tasks. The time restraint encouraged users to continue engaging with the game more, and the personalization connected with them. These tasks were split up into levels according to difficulty. For example, tasks included checking app permissions, enabling screen lock, disabling GPS, and turning off SMS permissions. Alongside the tasks, individuals also had to answer questions regarding privacy settings such as How can you stop your contacts from being used by apps? A person‚Äôs digital character had health that was determined by performance regarding the task and answering questions correctly.

Councilmembers Nick Licata and Kshama Sawant criticized the move. Haglund subsequently promised to waive a month's rent for the building's tenants and not to raise rent until the building passed city inspection. Haglund claimed that his building at 6511 Rainier Ave S was immune from the city's relocation-assistance requirements due to its below-market rents and tenants breaching the terms of their leases. Haglund later faced fines of $165,000 for failing to comply with tenant relocation assistance rules at a different property. Councilmember Sawant, referring to Haglund as a \\"notorious slumlord,\\" proposed a \\"Carl Haglund law\\" in 2015 which would ban landlords from raising rents on housing units that do not meet basic maintenance standards. In 2016, the Seattle City Council passed the bill into law. Several tenants' rights advocates referred to the bill as the \\"Carl Haglund bill\\" during public comment. In 2017, Haglund filed a lawsuit against the City of Seattle for defamation, seeking $25 million in damages, a retraction of \\"derogatory comments,\\" and a resolution apologizing to him. Haglund subsequently filed suit against Sawant personally. After a judge dismissed four of Haglund's nine claims, Haglund dropped the remaining ones. The City of Seattle spent about $250,000 defending against the lawsuits. In 2015 Haglund sued Sherrard Ewing, a tenant in one of Haglund's buildings who left a negative review of the property on Yelp. A King County Superior Court Judge dismissed the lawsuit as \\"frivolous\\" and ordered Haglund to pay Ewing‚Äôs legal bills, which likely amounted to tens of thousands of dollars. Haglund proposed a 150-unit condominium building with retail space in Columbia City, Seattle in 2016. The city's Southeast Design Review Board subsequently approved the building, subject to conditions, in 2018.Project Number 3018722‚ÄêLU Southeast Design Review Board report In 2017, Haglund was fined $1.1 million by a Pierce County, Washington Superior Court judge for vandalizing a building in Tacoma that he intended to buy. The plaintiffs contended that Haglund cut holes in drywall ceilings and cut wiring in the building to cause the building's value to decrease in value or enter foreclosure. In 2019 Haglund let Weld Seattle, a local charity, use a bungalow that he owns near Mount Baker station as transitional housing for former prisoners and formerly homeless persons. In 2020, Haglund formed the Carl Haglund Foundation which provides grants for education about homelessness and opioid addiction.

This is the first Novel by Jeong to have an official English translation; the author created three novels prior to this one. Hachette India published the book in English in that country. The book is about a murder; G. Sampath of The Hindu stated that the book centers on the \\"interiority\\" of the person who murders. Anuradha Varma of Indian Express wrote that the book \\"also touches upon complicated family dynamics and how death changes relationships.\\" Contents The main character is Han Yu- jin, 25 years old in the story, who has an adopted brother, Kim Hae-jin. Yu- jin finds his mother dead in his Incheon apartment and realizes that he is a murderer. He resented his mother for forbidding him from doing swimming and for giving preferential treatment to his adopted brother. Yu-jin decides what to do, and later has a confrontation with Hae-jin. Walter Sim of the Straits Times stated that since the book reveals the identity of the murderer relatively early, The Good Son \\"evolves into a chilling psychological look down the rabbit hole into a seriously unhinged mind.\\" Much of the novel includes Yu-jin having self-dialogs.

He pled guilty to charges of human smuggling, communication fraud, fraud and other charges in June 2020. His actions violated a compact between the United States and the Marshall Islands, which bans Marshallese people from traveling to the United States for adoptions unless they have a specific visa.  Criminal actions  Petersen charged couples $35,000 to adopt children from the Islands, and hired individuals to recruit pregnant women to give birth in the United States, then give their children up for adoption. In compensation the women received $10,000 and the cost of their travel was covered. Some adoptive families denied being made aware that Petersen was paying the women involved, and many of the women claim that the only medical care they received was during labor pains or while they were giving birth. Petersen illegally accessed state funded medical benefits to aid the women to have medical care, reportedly about $814,000 in Arizona Medicaid funds. One adoptive couple who worked with Petersen went to a home that housed some of the women involved in the scheme. They later told investigators they believed the home to be a part of a \\"baby mill\\" and they saw many women sleeping on mattresses on the floor. After the adoptions occurred, the birth mothers either moved to Arkansas or returned to the Marshall Islands.  Legal action  Investigation into Petersen began in December 2018 after a state trooper was tipped off about concerns surrounding the legitimacy of the adoption process, by a friend who was considering to adopt with Petersen. Utah officials began investigating into Petersen after a hospital staffer Utah called an attorney general tip line in October 2017, with concerns about a possible illegal adoption involving a Marshallese women at the hospital. Investigators in Utah, found an influx of Marshallese women giving birth and placing their babies up for adoption while listing the same house owned by Petersen as their place of residence. Petersen was charged by officials from Utah, Arizona, and Arkansas in October 2019 in relation to allegedly smuggling pregnant women from the Marshall Islands into the United States for the adoption of their children. In Arizona, Petersen was charged with twenty-nine counts of fraudulent schemes and three counts of conspiracy, theft and forgery, along with eleven other felonies including communications fraud, human smuggling and sale of a child in Utah, and nineteen federal charges of relating to the illegal entry of individuals to Arkansas.  Plea deals  Petersen entered guilty pleas in three courts in June 2020. He pled guilty in Arizona on June 18; in Utah‚Äôs Third District Court on June 19; and in U.S. District Court in Fayetteville, Arkansas on June 24. As part of his plea agreement with the state of Arizona, Petersen paid $650,000 to the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (the states Medicaid agency); $11,000 to an unnamed victim; and $18,000 to the Arizona attorney general's office to cover investigative costs. As part of his plea deal in federal court, some federal charges will be dropped after he is sentenced. His federal sentences may be served concurrently with his state sentences.  Personal life  Prior to his conviction, Petersen was the Maricopa County Assessor and an adoption lawyer licensed in Utah, Arizona, and Arkansas. He is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and served his church mission trip to the Marshall Islands.

The poem was first published by Mondadori. in 2005. On the occasion of the tragedy's 70th anniversary, a second edition was published in 2013 by Marsilio Editori.  Plot  The dialogue takes place between two characters, Ettore B., an Italian soldier who officially died in combat on September 17 (but was perhaps executed), and Hans D., a German businessman. The relationships tying the two characters to the events that occurred on the island are very different: those of Ettore B. are real and final and those of Hans D., conceivably surreptitious. Their presence acquires meaning only on a symbolic level. Ettore B. is a direct victim of the war; Hans D. is an indirect executioner who cannot escape from the suspicion that executioners‚Äîdirect or indirect‚Äîcannot be absolved by invoking a duty to obey or, least of all, a state of ignorance.  Historical background  On the evening of September 8, 1943, the commander of the Italian Division Acqui, General Antonio Gandin, received orders to offer resistance to any request to disarm that might come from the Italians' former allies, the Germans. Already present on the island of Cephalonia and numerically inferior, the Germans were certain of receiving reinforcements and of being able to count on aerial support. They gave the Italians the following ultimatum: continue to battle beside the Germans, turn over their heavy arms (with a promise of repatriation), and take up arms against us. \\"General Hubert Lanz wrote / on the leaflets: Lay down your arms, almost as if it were a matter of the deposito barbae of surreptitiously gowned children: We do not want this battle. / And he added, as enticement: You will be annihilated by overwhelming forces\\". After numerous requests for specific orders, to which the Badoglio government did not give any response, and after several failed attempts to placate the new enemies, including turning over to them key posts for control of the island, such as the pass of Kardakata, the third option was chosen, one desired more by the division's high command than by the commanding officer. Cut down by the German stukas, 1,250 soldiers fell in combat<.ref name=\\"pietredellememoria\\"> After the surrender, Hitler in person, on September 18, issued the order that no man be taken as prisoner. 5,000 soldiers were summarily gunned down: one of the most violent massacres of prisoners an all of the Second World War. Another 3,000 perished at sea as a result of the sinking of the ships that were transporting them to Germany. In 2001, Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi officially declared that Cephalonia massacre marked the first episode of the Italian Resistance against the Nazi-fascist forces. On the occasion of his visit to the site of the massacre, he went as far as asking Germany for an official apology but lost an opportunity to point out the Italian military command's profound irresponsibility in abandoning an entire division of infantry under aerial machine gun attack, and he decided to work on the poem. This grave omission was the instigation behind the writing of the poem which then developed along lines not planned kin advance.  Freud and historical truth  Ballerini imagines that beneath the material truth of the facts lies what, in psychoanalysis, Freud defined as historical truth. In the specific case of Cephalonia, this can be understood by keeping in mind the contempt that German soldier harbored toward the Italian. As Marcello Venturi observes in his Bandiera bianca a Cefalonia [White Flag at Cephalonia], the uniform worn by the German soldier constituted a guarantee of belonging in which he felt fully realized, whereas that worn by the Italian solder was experienced as if it were a weight, a straitjacket that officials and soldiers could not wait to remove to return to their civilian clothing This substantive cultural difference finds its tragic result in the fighting on Cephalonia. Those who reject the uniform's symbolic representation of the values of courage and discipline agree to fight, knowing that they will be defeated by an enemy whose values have been accepted as a necessary and exhilarating duty. The comedic actor becomes more tragic than the tragic hero; it is an intolerable game of chess that triggers savage ferocity. > ...most disredemptive illusions, the collapsing of senses that would > excplain the umistakable taste filling the mouth when the shrill of the / > massacre deserts it ... not as precaution, but from insolvency. For / trhe > feeling of disdain could not be reciprocal  Genre, language, and style  Ballerini previously experimented with two- person monologues in Uno monta la luna (2001), in which Heine speaks with his character Doctor Faust, and Greta Garbo with the figure of the spy Mata Hari, as portrayed by her on the screen. The exchange between Ettore B. and Hans D. unfolds as a desperate attempt to find a rational explanation for events that are revoltingly absurd and, after a journey interwoven with philosophical reflections, literary allusions, historical references, and anecdotes taken from everyday life, end with a chorus in which the motivations of injustice and reason give way to the neo-epic theme of nostos, the return to which every human being aspires but that proves impossible for all. > ...he who spends his life returning and finds / delights in the yearning of > not returning, his life is the same as // passing from exasperated sense to > sounds inducing laughter: / will it do, for laughter, to hide the gap that > leads to a game of roles, // to the hassle of holding back? This shift of meaning from a known starting point to an unexpected end is rendered possible by an unconventional use of language that, attenuating its referential and contextual functions, puts into play syntagms supported by a fresh network of signifiers. > queen of hearts is different from queen / premature, from the high prices > that cannot and will not endure, apart / by nature, from the disdain I love, > from which, with care, I must forbear The tone of the speech and the narrative framework are markedly sarcastic. This rhetoricl device has been adopted to inject facts with the venom of a disturbing quality. Against all principles of compatibility between inventio and elocutio, the clash between German and Italian troops at Cephalonia is incongruously cast a soccer match that lasts from the moment of the massacre to 2001 (the year of the Ciampi's official visit). The resounding victory of the Italian team (final score 4 to 1) is explained in terms of > Here it is the abandonments and betrayals victimizing the Italian soldiers > that count as goals and determine Italy's victory with a score of 4 to 1.  Critical reception  Upon its publication, in 2005, reviews of Cefalonia appeared in nearly all literary supplements of national Italian newspapers. Particularly relevant are those by Roberto Galaverni (La morale inquietudine lombarda di Ballerini, Alias - il Manifesto, May 14 2005) Stefano Colangelo (Il tempo matto, nei versi di Ballerini, Liberazione, May 18 2005), Laura Lilli (La rabbia dei versi racconta Cefalonia, La Repubblica, June 11 2005) and Felice Piemontese (Cefalonia tra calcio e guerra, Il Mattino, July 30 2005). Cefalonia also attracted the critical attention of noted poet Elio Pagliarani (La tragedia di Cefalonia narrata in versi da Ballerini, Il caff√® illustrato, 2005, pp. 22-26) who praised the work remarking on how the tension running through the dialogued poem is activated by facts that are purposely kept at bay, as it is the case in classical Greek tragedies. Returning to this factual absence, in his introduction to the second edition of Cefalonia 1943-2001 (Venezia, Marsilio, 2013, pp. 9-16) Cesare De Michelis wrote: If the poet, no matter how epic his poetry, is forced to renounce storytelling, he can hardly avoid the task of interpreting and judging. The words he conjures up after the events are to identify the reasons of their having occurred, which implies, in turn, analysing the presence they have established through time [...] He will cease to be a storyteller to become a philosopher and a moralist; he shall have to measure himself against the fragility of words, of all e words, his own included ... In his introduction to Ballerini's Collected poems (Mondadori, 2016), Cavatorta had also underlined the conjunction of linguistic invention and political commitment that characterize Cefalonia: In Ballerini, the writing of poetry is a very special type of liturgy, 'a service undertaken on behalf of the people,' a modality enwrapping readers in an unhinging and effervescent language, leading them from the initial theme of war and pain to an unsettling reflection on the necessity of an impossible return. A number of essays dedicated to Cefalonia are also contained in Balleriniana, a collection of critical contributions and biographical sketches edited by Beppe Cavatorta and Elena Coda, published by Danilo Montanari Editore in Ravenna in 2010, to mark the author's seventieth birthday. Cefalonia has received fresh critical attention in La p√¢t√© allegra del pesce, a collection of essays ion Ballerini's poetry and poetics, edited by Ugo Perolino (Lanciano, Carabba, 2020). In 2005 Cefalonia was awarded the Lorenzo Montano Prize (established in Verona in 1986, it is an Italian literary prize conceived and promoted by the literary magazine Anterem) and the Brancati Prize assigned annually in September at Zafferana-Etnea, Catania (the award was established in 1967 on the initiative of some Sicilian writers in memory of Vitaliano Brancati).  Translations  Cefalonia 1943-2001 has been translated into English and Spanish. Before its complete publication by Mondadori, the poem was published in English in issues 5 through 9 of the journal Or, a publication of Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles, edited by Paul Vangelisti. Vaso Roto of Madrid published a Spanish translation in 2013 by Lino Gonz√°lez Veiguela. In 2016, it was issued in the United States by The Brooklyn Rail, translated by Evgenia Matt.

It was written over a period of three and a half years by Aleksy \\"Alex\\" Ucha≈Ñski, Piotr \\"Gawron\\" Gawrysiak and Piotr \\"Micz\\" Ma≈Ñkowski, who were prominent Polish video game journalists at the time. It had its premiere at the Gambleriada computer exposition, held in October 23-25, 1998. It is considered to be the first Polish book about the history of computer games.  Contents  Each chapter of the book is devoted to a different game genre and begins with a short definition of the genre. The bulk of each chapter consists of descriptions of individual games, considered by the authors to be the most important examples of the given genre, arranged in chronological order. In addition, the authors occasionally discuss at length a specific trend or sub-genre. Each chapter also contains a list of the \\"top ten games of all time\\" of the genre, as judged by the authors. For example, the list of \\"top ten shooter games\\" is as follows: Commando, Defender, River Raid, Green Beret, Ghosts 'n Goblins, Super Zaxxon, Maggotmania (a clone of Centipede), Tapper, Gyruss and Star Wars: Rebel Assault. The book includes the following genres: shooter games, platform games, arcade adventure games, fighting games (including beat 'em up games), sports games, racing games, vehicle simulators, adventure games, role-playing games, strategy games (divided into \\"wargames\\" and \\"economic games\\"), and three-dimensional shooters (including first- and third-person shooters).  Reception  At the time of publication, Biblia komputerowego gracza attracted attention as the first publication in Poland that thoroughly discussed the history of computer games. The reviewer in the Gambler magazine recommended the book to every gamer eager to learn more about his hobby, and the reviewer in the Secret Service magazine admired the wealth of information contained in the book. Micha≈Ç Zacharzewski, a reviewer at the website Imperium Gier (part of the Wirtualna Polska portal), considered the book \\"amazing\\" and rated it as follows: \\"for people who remember ¬´those¬ª times 9/10, for youngsters 7/10\\". However, the book was criticized for having very few illustrations, and for the brief and vague game descriptions; according to the reviewers, these aspects made the book less useful for readers unfamiliar with the presented games. The book was also noted to contain erroneous and incomplete information (for example, many entries for older games include the note \\"developer unknown\\"). In addition, reviewers criticized the writing style as humorless and sloppy.

Evans, Jr. (May 17, 1943 ‚Äì March 24, 2001) was an American chemist and professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He was a leading researcher into organophosphorus chemistry. His research led to a greater understanding of the functions of organophosphate compounds and innovations in methods to produce chemical compounds for pharmaceutical drugs. Early life and education Slayton Alvin Evans, Jr. was born on May 17, 1943 in Chicago, Illinois to Corine M. Thompson Evans and Slayton A. Evans, Sr. Months later, his father was called to serve in World War II. When Slayton was three years old, the family moved to Meridian, Mississippi, where they lived in a segregated public housing project and his father worked at a J. C. Penney store. Slayton's interest in chemistry began early, when he was given a chemistry set. In addition, a small microscope allowed him to study various plant specimens and insects. Evans and his two younger siblings enrolled at a segregated primary school run by the Roman Catholic Church, and later he attended St. Joseph's High School. In 1957, when Evans was in the ninth grade, news of the artificial satellite Sputnik inspired him to learn about rocketry and attempt to build his own. While he was given permission by the nuns at his school to buy chemicals to make rocket fuel, he had to make his own powdered charcoal. He built six rockets, two of them achieving liftoff. Evans helped pay for his school tuition by mowing lawns and during eighth grade he was a junior assistant janitor at his elementary school. Later he worked in the high school cafeteria. In his third year of high school, he considered going into the Air Force, but was too tall for flight training. However, he took several competitive examinations and was the recipient of an academic scholarship to Tougaloo College where he also received an athletic scholarship for basketball. He enrolled at Tougaloo in 1961. By the end of his first year, Evans had top marks in chemistry in his class. He got a summer job working for the pharmaceutical company Abbott Laboratories in Chicago where he was tasked first with creating chemical compounds from raw materials, and later with identifying the stages of chemical reactions. Evans graduated from Tougaloo with a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry in 1965. Evans was encouraged to attend graduate school, though he didn't know how to pay for it. He briefly attended the Illinois Institute of Technology before transferring to Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, where he was offered a research assistant position in the chemistry department. In his first year, he received a draft notice to go to the Vietnam War. University officials contacted the draft board and explained that Evans' research was crucial to the war effort. He was researching a medicine to treat schistosomiasis, a disease caused by parasitic flatworms that are common in Southeast Asia. He completed his coursework in 1969 and received his Ph.D in Chemistry in early 1970. Research and academic career Evans took a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Texas at Arlington for the 1970‚Äì1971 academic year, followed by second fellowship at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, where he worked with the organic chemist Ernest L. Eliel studying stereochemistry. Upon the completion of the fellowship, he was invited to be a research instructor at Dartmouth College in 1972, though they did not have the laboratory equipment he required to continue his research. Evans then joined the faculty of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as an Assistant Professor of Chemistry in 1974. He was the first African-American chemistry professor at the university. After 10 years at Chapel Hill, Evans became a full professor, and in 1992 was honored with a Kenan Professor chair. Evans was a leading researcher in the field of organophosphorus chemistry, authoring more than 85 scientific articles on organosulfur and organophosphorus chemistry. His research led to a deeper understanding of the functions of organophosphate compounds and innovations in methods to produce chemical compounds for pharmaceutical drugs. Evans was inspired by William Standish Knowles, who in 1968 developed a method of asymmetric hydrogenation, which Evans used to develop alternative asymmetric synthesis methods as a way to produce single stereoisomers. Evans started experimenting with organophosphorus chemistry in 1970, developing a process using phosphorus atoms of organophosphate compounds as agents to produce specific stereoisomers. He also devised a method of asymmetric synthesis to synthesize alpha-amino phosphonic acids by adding phosphorus to sulfimides. At the University of North Carolina Evans assembled a research team of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows from around the world. In the 1980s, a Ford Foundation Fellowship allowed him to create ties between his research team and a research group at the Paul Sabatier University in France, where he spent a full sabbatical year. Later, with the help of a Fulbright Fellowship, he built ties with groups in Mexico, Poland, Germany, Greece, and Russia. Evans championed recruiting minority applicants to UNC-Chapel Hill, while on the national front, he served on committees of the American Chemical Society, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and was chair of the U.S. National Committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. He also served on a council that advised the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.

All justices of the Court agreed with the reasons of Martin J.  Background, facts, and procedural history  The Criminal Code defines a number of offences known as administration of justice offences. Such offences concern an accused's behaviour while he or she is involved in the criminal justice system, as opposed to conduct that results in criminal charges in the first instance. Zora concerns the administration of justice offence of breaching bail conditions: failing to comply with rules the court has set to govern an accused's conduct while the accused is out on bail pending trial. Chaycen Zora had been charged with drug possession under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and was released on bail with several conditions.Zora SCC at para 8. One of these conditions was that he would answer the door when the police came to check on him.Zora SCC at para 3. Due to his failure to comply with this condition, Zora was charged with an offence under section 145(3) of the Criminal Code. Zora was convicted at trial and his appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal was dismissed.Zora CA at para 69. The Court of Appeal held that the statute required an objective, not a subjective, standard of mens rea, and that Zora failed to meet the standard. That is, the statute required the Crown to prove that Zora's failure to comply with his bail condition represented a \\"marked departure from what a reasonable person in the same situation would do,\\"Zora CA at para 2. not that Zora either intended to breach his bail condition, knew that he was breaching it, or was reckless as to whether he breached it or not. Before the Supreme Court's decision in Zora, Canadian law was not consistent as to whether breach of bail conditions required subjective or objective mens rea. Courts in some provinces adopted one standard, while those in other provinces came to the opposite conclusion.Zora SCC at para 31. Because criminal law in Canada is defined by federal statute but interpreted and enforced by provincial courts and administrators, breach of bail conditions had become a different offence in different provinces.  Reasons of the Court  Justice Sheilah Martin, writing for a unanimous court, held that the Court of Appeal erred in finding that the statute only required proof of objective mens rea. Rather, s 145(3) requires a subjective standard. She held, following the Court's jurisprudence in R v Sault Ste-Marie (City of) and subsequent cases including R v ADH, 2013 SCC 28, that s 145(3) should be presumed to involve a subjective standard of fault and that the presumption was not displaced.Zora SCC at para 4. Justice Martin acknowledged that the Criminal Code had been amended after Zora's trial, creating two new offences‚Äîat sections 145(4) and 145(5), respectively‚Äîto cover the offence for which Zora had originally been convicted, but noted that the substance of the offence of failing to comply with bail conditions had not been significantly changed.Zora SCC at para 18. Thus, although Zora nominally concerns the interpretation of a now-defunct statute, its holding likely applies to 145(4) and 145(5). In the result, Justice Martin ordered a new trial.Zora SCC at para 123.  Commentary  Criminal defence lawyers spoke in favour of the decision, noting that it addressed broader issues in the Canadian bail system beyond the standard of fault in administration of justice offences.

It was never discussed in official Chinese public statements, but external concerns have been raised over its possible continued existence or revival. An article in a provisional mouthpiece magazine of the Chinese Communist Party verified the existence of this policy in the aftermath of the 2017 China‚ÄìIndia border standoff. Background Imperial China claimed suzerainty over Nepal, Sikkim, and Bhutan as an extension of its claim over Tibet. These claims were asserted by the Chinese imperial resident in Tibet in 1908, who wrote to the Nepalese authorities that Nepal and Tibet, \\"being united like brothers under the auspices of China, should work in harmony for mutual good.\\" He suggested the \\"blending of five colours\\" representing China, Tibet, Nepal, Sikkim, and Bhutan as part of his program to assert the Chinese claim in the face of British opposition. In 1939, the founding chairman of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Mao Zedong termed Bhutan and Nepal as China's tributary states. Origin The \\"Five Fingers of Tibet\\" policy has been widely attributed to Mao's speeches in the 1940s, but has never been discussed in official Chinese public statements. This construct considered Tibet to be the palm of China's right hand, with Ladakh, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan, and North-East Frontier Agency (now known as Arunachal Pradesh) being its five fingers. In 1954, Chinese officers in Tibet claimed that they would \\"liberate Sikkim, Bhutan, Ladakh, and the NEFA, which were wrongfully being held by the Indian imperialists.\\" In the same year, the Chinese government published a book called \\"A Brief History of Modern China\\" for school students, which included a map showing the territories allegedly taken by \\"imperialist powers\\" between 1840 and 1919, terming them as \\"portions of China that must be reclaimed.\\" This map included Ladakh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim, and the entire Northeast India. This was also noted in the memoirs of Indian diplomat Triloki Nath Kaul who was serving in Peking (now known as Beijing) at that time. Scholar B. S. K. Grover said that this map was a \\"serious reflection of Peking's ambitions\\" and not mere propaganda or \\"idle-boasting\\". The claims over the \\"five fingers\\" were asserted \\"emphatically and frequently\\" from 1958 to 1961 over the Peking and Lhasa radio systems. During a mass meeting in Lhasa in July 1959, Chinese lieutenant general Zhang Guohua said: \\"Bhutanese, Sikkimese and Ladakhis form a united family in Tibet. They have always been subject to Tibet and to the great motherland of China. They must once again be united and taught the communist doctrine.\\" Relevance to 21st century policy The policy, which was never discussed in Chinese public statements, is officially dormant now and the Chinese claims remain only on the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh and the Aksai Chin region India claims as part of Ladakh which is administered by China mostly as part of Hotan Prefecture, Xinjiang with a small portion administered as part of Ngari Prefecture, Tibet. However, fears have been expressed regarding its revival. After the 2017 China‚ÄìIndia border standoff at Doklam, an article in Qunzhong (mouthpiece magazine of CCP's Jiangsu provincial party standing committee) invoked the \\"five fingers\\" construct. The article, which was written by Nanjing University researcher Liu Litao, alleged that India's covert support to the Tibetan independence movement stems from Tibet's cultural and economic importance in the region and that despite the fact that India has \\"taken away the five fingers\\", it is impossible to fully control the region without the \\"palm\\" because of Tibetan culture's \\"centripetal force\\" on the \\"five fingers\\". The article added that as China's investments, trade, and economic relations with these regions increase, the Chinese influence in these regions will overtake that of India and will eliminate it to a \\"great extent\\". Lobsang Sangay, the leader of the Central Tibetan Administration, linked the policy with the Doklam standoff. It has also been cited as the reason behind the 2020 China‚ÄìIndia skirmishes by Sangay, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury (leader of the Indian National Congress in the Lok Sabha), Seshadri Chari (former foreign affairs cell head of the Bharatiya Janata party), and M. M. Khajuria (former Director General of Police of the former Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir). According to commentator Saurav Jha, the \\"five fingers\\" policy arises from the historical geography of the Himalayas which allows bi-directional territorial claims between Tibet and the southern regions. This leads to tensions between the trans-Himalayan powers which is \\"ultimately tempered by a balance of military capability,\\" and is the reason behind the longstanding Sino-Indian border dispute.

It could carry up to 11 passengers. Only one was completed. Design and development The Albatross in 1930 with Axelson engines The Zenith Albtross Z-12 was designed and built by the Zenith Aircraft Company of Santa Ana, California and first flew there in January 1930. By October 1929 Schofield Inc had bought the rights to build it at their Los Angeles factory and by January 1930 the prototype had been re-engined there. When the Albatross first flew in January 1928 it was described as the largest aircraft built on the West Coast. It was a three-engined, high wing monoplane with a span of and a large passenger cabin, designed for long haul routes including those from coast to coast. Its two spar wing was rectangular in plan out to rounded tips and braced on each side by a parallel pair of streamlined struts from the lower fuselage longerons to the spars. The Albatross was initially powered by three Siemens-Halske Sh 14 engines but in 1930 Schofield replaced them with Axelson A-7Rs. Both were 7 cylinder radial engines and were similarly mounted. The outer pair were attached to the forward wing strut, with triplets of upward struts to the forward spar and horizontal struts to the fuselage, and the central engine was mounted on the slender nose of the forward fuselage. Behind the central engine the fuselage expanded rapidly to the pilots' enclosed cabin, ahead of the wing leading edge, which seated the two pilots. In the original Zenith cabin there was also a bunk to allow one of the pilots to sleep on a long flight, but the Schofield layout seated a navigator instead. Immediately behind and below the crew a windowed cabin had individual seats for 9 passengers and a two or three-seater couch. Passengers entered their cabin via a port side door at the rear. There was a toilet behind the cabin together with a baggage compartment, though there was another baggage hold below the pilots' cabin. The tail was conventional, with tailplane and elevators set at mid-fuselage. The fin was triangular and carried a near rectangular, balanced rudder. The Albatross had fixed, split axle, tailwheel landing gear. The main wheels were on V-struts from the lower fuselage longrons, with vertical shock-absorbing landing legs joining the forward wing struts at the engine mountings. At some date between March 1928 and February 1930 the struts and legs were enclosed in aircraft fairings and the wheels semi-enclosed. Operational history After its first flight in January 1928, preparations began for an attempt on the world endurance record. In March it had flown carrying of fuel at a loaded wight of . With that quantity of fuel the calculated range was . At a cruising speed of the flight would have lasted just over 70 hrs but no reports of a record attempt are known. Also unknown is the date of the first flight with Axelson engines but by January 1930 it was reported as flying satisfactorily with them. Though Schofield had originally intended to put the Albatross into production there is no evidence of further examples.

Gurley 25 December 1868, died c. 1935) was once one of the wealthiest Black men and a founder of the Greenwood district in Tulsa, Oklahoma, known as \\"Black Wall Street\\".  Early life  Gurley was born in Huntsville, Alabama to John and Rosanna Gurley, formerly enslaved persons, and grew up in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. After attending public schools and self-educating, he worked as a teacher and in the postal service. . In 1889, he came to what was then known as Indian Territory to participate in the Oklahoma Land Rush, staking a claim in what would be known as Perry, Oklahoma. The young entrepreneur had just resigned from an appointment under president Grover Cleveland in order to strike out on his own.\\"Lori Latrice Sykes, Making the System Work for You: The Alexander Norton Story, M&B; Visionaries (2008) In Perry he rose quickly, running unsuccessfully for treasurer of Noble County at first, but later becoming principal at the town‚Äôs school and eventually starting and operating a general store for 10 years.  Greenwood District  In 1905, Gurley sold his store and land in Perry and moved with his wife, Emma, to the oil boomtown of Tulsa, where he purchased 40 acres of land which was \\"only to be sold to colored.\\" The first law passed in the new State of Oklahoma, 33 days after statehood, set in place a Jim Crow system of legally enforced segregation, and required blacks and whites to live in separate areas. However, Oklahoma was considered a significant economic and social opportunity by Gurley, politician Edward P. McCabe and others, leading to the establishment of 50 all-black towns and settlements, among the highest of any state or territory. Among Gurley's first businesses was a rooming house which was located on a dusty trail near the railroad tracks. This road was given the name Greenwood Avenue, named for a city in Mississippi. The area became very popular among black migrants fleeing the oppression in Mississippi. They would find refuge in Gurley's building, as the racial persecution from the south was non-existent on Greenwood Avenue. On the contrary, Greenwood was later dubbed Black Wall Street as it became increasingly self-sustained and catered to upwardly mobile Black people. Gurley also provided monetary loans to Black people wanting to start their own businesses. In addition to his rooming house, Gurley built three two-story buildings and five residences and bought an farm in Rogers County. Gurley also founded what is today Vernon AME Church.James S. Hirsch, Riot and Remembrance: The Tulsa Race War and Its Legacy, Houghton Mifflin (2002) He also helped build a black Masonic lodge and an employment agency. This implementation of \\"colored\\" segregation set the Greenwood boundaries of separation that still exist: Pine Street to the north, Archer Street and the Frisco tracks to the south, Cincinnati Street on the west, and Lansing Street on the east. Gurley formed an informal partnership with another Black American entrepreneur, J.B. Stradford, who arrived in Tulsa in 1899, and they developed Greenwood in concert. In 1914, Gurley's net worth was reported to be $150,000 (about $3 million in 2018 dollars). And he was made a sheriff's deputy by the city of Tulsa to police Greenwood's residents, which resulted in some viewing him with suspicion. By 1921, Gurley owned more than one hundred properties in Greenwood and had an estimated net worth between $500,000 and $1 million (between $6.8 million and $13.6 million in 2018 dollars). Gurley's prominence and wealth were short lived, and his position as a sheriff's deputy did not protect him during the race massacre. In a matter of moments, he lost everything. During the race massacre, The Gurley Hotel at 112 N. Greenwood, the street's first commercial enterprise as well as the Gurley family home, valued at $55,000, was lost, and with it Brunswick Billiard Parlor and Dock Eastmand & Hughes Cafe. Gurley also owned a two-story building at 119 N. Greenwood. It housed Carter's Barbershop, Hardy Rooms, a pool hall, and cigar store. All were reduced to ruins. By his account and court records, he lost nearly $200,000 in the 1921 race massacre.  Later Life  Because of his leadership role in creating this self-sustaining exclusive black \\"enclave,\\" it has been rumored that Gurley was lynched by a white mob and buried in an unmarked grave. However, according to the memoirs of Greenwood pioneer, B.C. Franklin,John Hope Franklin and John Whittington Franklin, eds., My Life and an Era, the Autobiography of Buck Colbert Franklin, Louisiana State University Press (1998) Gurley left Greenwood for Los Angeles, California. Gurley and his wife, Emma, moved to a 4-bedroom home in South Los Angeles and ran a small hotel. He was honored in a 2009 documentary film called, Before They Die!

He was a student of BSc Chemistry. He was murdered by Campus Front of India, the students wing of Islamist organisation Popular Front of India. Abhimanyu was the youngest son of Manoharan and Bhoopathy two Tamil peasants from an Adivasi community in Vattavada. He was born on 23 July 1997. Parijith and Kowsalya are his siblings. His sister Kowsalya married Madhusudanan in a wedding attended by hundreds of students from Maharajas College. Abhimanyu was the Idukki District Committee member of the Students' Federation of India.  Death  Abhimanyu was murdered by a 16-member gang involving the activists of the Campus Front of India (CFI), Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and the Popular Front of India (PFI). He was just 20 year old at the time of his killing. According to the police reports, the murder was triggered after an argument between Students' Federation of India activists and Campus Front of India (CFI) over sticking posters within the Maharajas campus. The space for painting the college walls was first booked by SFI activists. This led to the issues with CFI members. Abhimanyu painted graffiti on the campus walls to welcome the new batch of students and he wrote \\"down with communalism\\". This slogan provoked the Campus Front of India (CFI) members. After the verbal argument CFI members returned to campus in the wee hours of July 2, 2018 with SDPI and PFI members and barged into the college hostel. Abhimanyu was held in position from behind and while another person stabbed him to death on the spot. An 19-year-old Arjun, a student of BA Philosophy also sustained severe injuries. He was admitted to the Ernakukulam Medical Trust Hospital and did undergo an emergency surgery. SFI observed a statewide strike protesting against the killing of their activist on July 2, 2018.  Aftermath  * In his memory, the Abhimanyu Maharajas Library was set up in Vattavada panchayat. Students across India contributed books over courier. Students mobilised around10,000 books and enough funds for the construction of library. * Simon Britto, another student leader who was paralysed after getting stabbed by the members of KSU activists at Maharaja's College on October 14, 1983 wrote a book named \\"Maharaja's Abhimanyu\\". The book was published by handing over a copy of it to writer M K Sanu on October 14, 2019. * Prominent civil society activists and writers like Sunil P Ilayidom, Balachandran Chullikkad and M K Sanu paid tributes to Abhimanyu's memory in a function organised at Maharajas college on September 19, 2018. Writer M.K Sanu drew a parallel between Abhimanyu's murder and the chopping of Professor T J Joseph's hand by religious extremists at Thodupuzha Newman College. Balachandran Chullikad remarked that he was murdered for raising voice against communalism. * CPI(M) build house for his family. The CPI (M) collected Rs 3.10 crore as ‚ÄòAbhimanyu martyr fund‚Äô to help Abhimanyu's family.

Born in Pillkallen in East Prussia, Regge worked in the fur trade from 1881. He joined a local union in 1888, which became part of the German Fur Workers' Union two years later. He also joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1890. He began working full-time for the union in 1893, and became its president the following year, but it dissolved amid disputes in 1896. In 1902, a new German Furriers' Union was founded, which Regge joined. He became its leader in 1910, also becoming editor of its journal, Der K√ºrschner. In addition, he was elected as general secretary of the International Federation of Furriers. He opposed World War I, resigning from the SPD, and becoming a founder member of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany, which he remained with until 1922, when, like the majority of the part, he rejoined the SPD. Membership of the Furriers' Union initially grew under Regge's leadership, peaking at 12,076 in 1921, but it then fell rapidly. As a result, at the start of 1924, Regge merged the union into the German Clothing Workers' Union (DBAV). The DBAV set up a furriers' section, employing Regge. The following year, the International Federation similarly merged into the International Clothing Workers' Federation. In 1930, Regge and Heinrich Lange wrote Geschichte der Zurichter, K√ºrschner und M√ºtzenmacher Deutschlands.

With the participation of more 114,000 soldiers, it was the largest military exercise conducted by the PLA since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Deng Xiaoping, then paramount leader of China and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, attended and observed the entire exercise along with other senior officials.  History  From October 1980 to March 1981, Deng Xiaoping determined that a military exercise was necessary for the People's Liberation Army (PLA), and chose the largest version in terms of exercise scale from the three proposed plans. The details of arrangement and organization were left to the Beijing Military Region. On March 12, 1981, a central committee for the exercise was established, with Yang Dezhi, then PLA Chief-of-Staff, being the director of the committee; Yang Yong, Zhang Zhen and Qin Jiwei were appointed the vice directors. In September 1981, Deng Xiaoping attended and observed the military exercise along with other senior officials including Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang and Li Xiannian. A total of over 32,000 military and governmental officials observed the exercise. Specifically, 114,000 PLA soldiers participated in the exercise, in addition to 1,327 tanks and armored vehicles, 1,541 cannons, 475 airplanes as well as 10,606 army trucks. The exercised was funded by the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and accounted for 1/16 of China's military expenditures of that year. On September 19, 1981, a large-scale military parade took place after the exercise at the airport of Zhangjiakou, where Deng Xiaoping delivered a closing speech.
