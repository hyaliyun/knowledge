Declarations of LGBT-free zones in 2019 and 2020 and the 2020 Polish presidential election, which saw President Andrzej Duda use anti- LGBT rhetoric, have led to protest from LGBT rights activists, who adopted direct action tactics. On 7 August, a court granted a request for Margot's pre-trial detention for two months. She presented herself for arrest while hundreds of sympathizers protested the arrest. The police initially declined to arrest her, but later tried to do so and were physically, but non-violently blocked by activists. The police then arrested 48 people: Margot, protestors, and others who had not taken part in the demonstration. Some detainees were beaten, subjected to unnecessary strip-searches, or denied access to lawyers. All but Margot were released later that weekend after spending the night in jail. The excessive arrests and police brutality on 7 August were criticized by the Polish Ombudsman, , Council of Europe human rights commissioner, and dozens of celebrities including Margaret Atwood. Solidarity protests have occurred in several cities in Poland, Germany, and the United Kingdom. On 16 August, a right-wing demonstration was held in Warsaw opposing \\"LGBT aggression\\". Background Some opposition members of the Sejm formed a rainbow to protest the 2020 inauguration of President Andrzej Duda. \\"Stop Pedofilii\\" van belonging to , linking homosexuality with pedophilia According to a 2019 survey, 24% of Poles believe that the LGBT movement is the greatest threat facing their country. Between 2019 and 2020, nearly 100 Polish municipalities and regions declared themselves \\"LGBT-free zones\\". The ruling Law and Justice party ran an anti-LGBT campaign during the 2020 Polish presidential election. President Andrzej Duda emphasized the issue, stating, \\"LGBT is not people, it's an ideology\\", calling it an \\"ideology of evil\\" that is \\"even more dangerous to mankind than communism\\". Duda narrowly won the election, by the thinnest margin since the end of the Soviet Union. According to ILGA-Europe's 2020 report, Poland is ranked worst among European Union countries for LGBT rights. Some LGBT activists, including the collective \\"Stop Bzdurom\\" (\\"Stop Bullshit\\"), have adopted illegal direct action tactics due to frustration with what they see as increasing, state-sponsored attacks against them. One target is the vans belonging to , which are covered in anti-LGBT slogans associating homosexuality and pedophilia, a message which the vans also broadcast on loudspeakers. The drivers know where the Stop Bzdurom activists live and target their place of residence. LGBT organizations such as Campaign Against Homophobia and Tolerado have attempted to stop the vans by reporting them to the police; however, these efforts have been mostly unsuccessful due to the lack of recognition of anti-LGBT speech in Poland's hate speech laws. Stop Bzdurom activists took a different approach, spray- painting the vans and breaking off their license plates. ≈Åania Madej, a member of the group, stated, \\"We do it only for the queer kids who run with us and they have a little bit of fun and feel brave for 10 minutes.\\" Ma≈Çgorzata Szutowicz, better known as Margot, is another member of Stop Bzdurom and Madej's partner. She is accused of damaging a Fundacja Pro van in late June and assaulting the driver, for which she was arrested, charged, and released after the first judge to hear the case refused the prosecution's request for pre-trial detention. Not all LGBT people in Poland agree with Stop Bzdurom's tactics. In late July, Stop Bzdurom placed rainbow flags and anarchist bandanas on statues of Nicolaus Copernicus, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, the Mermaid of Warsaw, and Jesus in Warsaw. The activists released a manifesto, stating, \\"As long as the rainbow scandalizes anybody and is treated as inappropriate we solemnly pledge to provoke\\". The action shocked some Polish Catholics, including Law and Justice Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who called the actions \\"desecration\\" and posted photographs of himself praying in front of the Jesus statue. Stop Bzdurom later relocated the candle he left behind, placing it where a transgender person had killed themselves by jumping off a bridge. Former prime minister Donald Tusk tweeted, \\"Jesus has always been on the side of the weaker and the harmed, never on the side of the oppressive governments\\". On 5 August, Margot, Madej, and another activist involved in the flag drapings were arrested for \\"insulting religious feelings and disrespecting Warsaw monuments\\", charged, and released after about 40 hours. Warsaw's mayor, Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, stated that he disapproved of the flag draping but criticized the arrests for violating the rule of law. 7 August mass arrest Campaign Against Homophobia at the 2018 equality march in Rzesz√≥w alt= On 7 August 2020, a second judge granted an arrest warrant against Margot which provided for two months pre-trial detention, which was considered excessive and politically motivated by some LGBT rights supporters. Margot was waiting at Campaign Against Homophobia's office in Warsaw to be arrested, but the police initially said that she would not be arrested. Hundreds of protestors had showed up, including left-wing MP Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-BƒÖk, and the protest moved to another location in central Warsaw, around Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie and Wilcza streets, before another group of plainclothes police tried to arrest Margot. Some protestors used civil disobedience to prevent this. Two people sat on the hood of the police car while others blocked the path of the vehicle. In total, forty-eight people, including Margot, were arrested, which was described as a \\"mass arrest\\", and held in at least four police stations in Warsaw. Among those arrested were LGBT activist Bartosz Staszewski, a 52-year-old amateur journalist, Malgorzata Rawinska, who had been reporting on the protest, and an Italian legal resident who happened on the demonstration and was arrested while watching it. The Polish Ombudsman reported that \\"among the arrested, there are people who did not take active part in the gatherings on Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie or Wilcza street, but were watching the incident. Some of them had rainbow emblems ‚Äì bags, pins, flags. Among the detained there were also arbitrary people who in a certain moment were, for example, coming out of a shop with bags.\\" Campaign Against Homophobia reported that \\"The police were aggressively pushing the protesters out of the way, knocking people to the ground and holding them down with their boots\\". Those arrested were initially not given the reason for their arrest, but later told that they might face charges for \\"taking part in an illegal gathering during the COVID-19 pandemic\\". According to lawyer Emilia Barabasz, who is working pro bono for some of those arrested, most of the detainees were charged under of the Criminal Code \\"active participation in an illegal gathering\\" and some were also charged with Article 57a, \\"hooligan misconduct\\". Some of those arrested reported being beaten by police and suffering injuries, questioned without a lawyer present, or denied medical treatment and water. Some were strip- searched despite no indication that they possessed drugs or any dangerous item, and transgender arrestees were misgendered. To justify their actions, police later released a video of the mass arrest called \\"Through the eyes of the police\\", which did not show any violence on the part of the protesters. According to Balkan Insight, \\"testimonies from the detained and their lawyers, as well as independent observers, point to a disproportionate response by the police, who arrested peaceful protesters and even random passers-by while acting violently\\". All except Margot were released later that weekend after spending the night in jail. Later, police visited the addresses of the arrestees, which a spokesperson for said was unusual and unwarranted except for serious crime, and could be considered a form of police harassment. Margot was taken to P≈Çock where she was held in solitary confinement and released on 28 August following an appeal by her lawyer. Solidarity demonstrations rainbow flag on the Maria Konopnicka monument in Krak√≥w in August 2020 A rainbow was erected outside the Warsaw museum Zachƒôta National Gallery of Art in August 2020 After word got out of the arrests, sympathizers gathered outside the police stations to protest, and multiple parliamentarians, including and Klaudia Jachira of Civic Coalition, visited the police stations to ensure that detainees' human rights were respected. Pro-bono legal help was offered to many of those arrested. Some of the people outside Wilcza Street police station were also arrested. The next day, thousands of mostly young people gathered in Warsaw to protest the arrests, using slogans such as \\"You will not lock all of us up!\\" and \\"She will never walk alone!\\" Activists pinned a rainbow flag to the Copernicus monument and criticized Trzaskowski for not attending the demonstration. Several MPs were in attendance: Joanna Scheuring- Wielgus, , , Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-BƒÖk, Anna Maria ≈ªukowska, , , Krzysztof ≈ömiszek, and Maciej Gdula (all from The Left) and Barbara Nowacka, , and from Civic Coalition. The writers and ≈Åukasz Orbitowski also participated in the demonstration. Over the weekend, solidarity demonstrations were also held in Krak√≥w (300 people attended), Lublin, Wroc≈Çaw, Rzesz√≥w, Bia≈Çowie≈ºa, Bydgoszcz, Gda≈Ñsk, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Pozna≈Ñ, Tarn√≥w, and Zielona G√≥ra. The demonstration in Czƒôstochowa on 10 August attracted around 150 participants, including Democratic Left Alliance MP Zdzis≈Çaw Wolski. On 17 August, there was a solidarity demonstration in , Sosnowiec, attended by about 20 people including Modern MP Monika Rosa and local politician Janusz Kubicki. Police had to protect them from a larger group of counter-demonstrators who threatened and insulted the participants in the soldiarity demonstration; one of them was later criminally charged for making threats. During the next week, solidarity demonstrations were held outside the Polish Institute in Berlin and in front of the Polish embassy in Budapest. A 13 August march in Leipzig was attended by 300 people, and Rainbow Slovakia activists hung a rainbow flag on the statue of John Paul II in Bratislava. Soldiarity protests occurred on 10 August and 13 August outside the Polish consulate in Edinburgh. On 15 August, a protest reportedly attended by 100 people was held outside the Polish embassy in London, as well as demonstrations in Manchester and Newcastle the same day, and in Bristol on 18 August. The protests in the United Kingdom were organized by members of the Polish diaspora. The week after the mass arrest, in Szczecin an activist was cited for carrying a sign stating \\"Jesus would walk with us\\", which was alleged to fall under the crime of \\"offending religious feelings\\". Six people in Krak√≥w were cited for hanging a rainbow flag over a statue of the Wawel Dragon; possible charges suggested by the police included \\"putting an object in the wrong place\\" and \\"disturbing public order\\". Undeterred, activists continue to block vans and drape rainbow flags despite others facing criminal charges for these actions. Rainbow flags have been hung on buildings, including the former SS headquarters in Warsaw, of the University of Warsaw, and Polish Theatre in Pozna≈Ñ. \\"Stop LGBT aggression\\" (16 August) Main gate of the University of Warsaw, 2019 On Sunday 16 August, nationalist demonstrators held a demonstration in Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie, near the main gate of the University of Warsaw, called \\"Stop LGBT aggression\\" (\\"Przeciw agresji LGBT\\" or \\"Stop agresji LGBT\\"). Demonstrators burned a rainbow flag‚Äîwhich counter-demonstrators stated was stolen from them‚Äîand shouted, \\"Away with deviation\\" and \\"How's Margot?\\" On the nationalist side, All-Polish Youth leader Ziemowit Przebitkowski, MP Krzysztof Bosak (Confederation) and anti-abortion activist gave speeches. A counter- demonstration was attended by The Greens MPs and Ma≈Çgorzata Tracz, as well as Civic Coalition's MP Franciszek Sterczewski and The Left MP Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-BƒÖk. A heavy police presence kept both groups strictly separated from each other. Prior to the demonstration, someone had painted a rainbow on the street, which police said was an unknown substance that posed a threat to vehicle traffic. Reactions The Polish Ombudsman, Adam Bodnar, stated that he was deeply concerned by the police response. His office had interviewed 33 of those arrested on 7 August 2020, and launched an investigation. Bodnar added that he thought it was unnecessary to arrest so many people and that the excessive police actions \\"constituted abuse of human rights\\". Bodnar said that the authorities' response to a demonstration depended on whether it was \\"liked by the authorities or not\\": right-wing demonstrations have not attracted a police response. Dunja Mijatoviƒá, human rights commissioner for the Council of Europe, called for Margot's immediate release, tweeting \\"Order to detain her for 2 months sends very chilling signal for #FreedomOfSpeech & #LGBT rights in #Poland\\". On TOK FM radio station, lawyer Michal Wawrykiewicz stated: \\"The way the police behaved is incompatible with Polish law. The names and ranks of the officers were missing on the uniforms. And finally, access to legal counsel was made difficult for the arrested.\\" Former police commandant of Zgierz district, Iwona Lewandowska, stated that the response \\"ruined the image of the police\\". Trzaskowski stated that the response to the protest was \\"grossly disproportionate\\". However, Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro, of United Poland party, defended the police response and said \\"defense of banditry by politicians is unheard of\\". On 8 August, Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights released a statement criticizing excessive arrests and police brutality in connection with the previous day's mass arrest, which was signed by dozens of other Polish civil society groups. Police actions were criticized in a letter signed by dozens of former Solidarity activists, who compared it to the state persecution of anti-Communists in the Polish People's Republic. On 20 August, OKO.press published a letter from a number of prominent religious figures, including Michael Schudrich, the Chief Rabbi of Poland, stating that they disagreed with the pre-trial detention of Margot. The same day, French MEP Pierre Karleskind stated that he had recruited 64 MEPs to refer the matter of the 7 August mass arrest to the European Commission because \\"The European Union cannot stand idly by in the face of this new provocation.\\" More than 200 academics at universities in Poland and around the world signed a letter published on 12 August, including Judith Butler, Noam Chomsky, Roberto Esposito, and Jan Tomasz Gross. The signatories \\"express our deep concern about the unprecedented attack on the LGBT + community in Poland\\" and \\"call on the Polish authorities to release Ma≈Çgorzata Szutowicz immediately and to guarantee the rights of LGBT + people\\". On 18 August, 75 celebrities including Ed Harris, Pedro Almod√≥var, James Norton, Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek, and Margaret Atwood published an open letter (addressed to Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission) in Gazeta Wyborcza. The letter asks the European Commission \\"to take immediate steps to defend core European values ‚Äì equality, non-discrimination, respect for minorities ‚Äì which are being blatantly violated in Poland\\" and calls upon the Polish government \\"to hold accountable those who are responsible for unlawful and violent arrests of August 7, 2020\\" and \\"to stop targeting sexual minorities\\". As of 17 August, neither von der Leyen nor Charles Michel, president of the European Council, has made a statement on the incident. On 2 September, the police crackdown was discussed by the Sejm's internal affairs committee. A representative of the police did not answer all questions posed by opposition MPs, refusing to say why it was necessary to arrest the demonstrators. The events have been dubbed \\"Polish Stonewall\\" by some LGBT activists and media, in an analogy to the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York.

It is situated in the Cascade Range, north of Spirit Lake, and northeast of Coldwater Peak. Its nearest higher neighbor is Mount Whittier, to the north, and Mount St. Helens rises to the south. Precipitation runoff from Mount Margaret drains into Coldwater Creek, a tributary of the North Fork Toutle River. A hiking trail provides access to this mountain. This peak was named some time before 1900 by an admiring prospector for Margaret \\"Maggie\\" Shultz Layton (1877-1965), a pioneering resident of Toledo, Washington. Geology Mt. Margaret from east The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity occurred. The lateral blast from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens was pointed toward Mount Margaret and stripped the vegetation from its slopes. Due to Mount Saint Helens' proximity to Mount Margaret, volcanic ash is common in the area. Climate Mt. Margaret centered, from Spirit Lake at dawn Coldwater Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.

It can be used to describe high- dimensional polytopes with few vertices, by transforming them into sets of points in a space of a much lower dimension. The process can also be reversed, to construct polytopes with desired properties from their Gale diagrams. The Gale transform and Gale diagram are named after David Gale, who introduced these methods in a 1956 paper on neighborly polytopes. Definitions=Transform Given a d-dimensional polytope, with n vertices, adjoin 1 to the Cartesian coordinates of each vertex, to obtain a (d+1)-dimensional column vector. The matrix A of these n column vectors has dimensions (d+1)\\\\times n and rank d. The Gale transform replaces this matrix by a matrix B of dimension n\\\\times (n-d-1), whose column vectors are a basis for the kernel of A. Then B has n row vectors, of dimension n-d-1. These row vectors form the Gale diagram of the polytope. There is a choice of which basis for the kernel to use, but it changes the result only by a linear transformation., Definition 5.2, p. 38 A proper subset of the vertices of a polytope forms the vertex set of a face of the polytope, if and only if the complementary set of vectors of the Gale transform has a convex hull that contains the origin in its relative interior., Theorem 5.6, p. 41 Equivalently, the subset of vertices forms a face if and only if there is no linear function that assigns non-negative values to the complementary vectors., p. 170 Linear diagram Because the Gale transform is defined only up to a linear transformation, its nonzero vectors can be normalized to all be (n-d-1)-dimensional unit vectors. The linear Gale diagram is a normalized version of the Gale transform, in which all the vectors are zero or unit vectors. Affine diagram Given a Gale diagram of a polytope, that is, a set of n unit vectors in an (n-d-1)-dimensional space, one can choose a (n-d-2)-dimensional subspace S through the origin that avoids all of the vectors, and a parallel subspace S' that does not pass through the origin. Then, a central projection from the origin to S' will produce a set of (n-d-2)-dimensional points. This projection loses the information about which vectors lie above S and which lie below it, but this information can be represented by assigning a sign (positive, negative, or zero) or equivalently a color (black, white, or gray) to each point. The resulting set of signed or colored points is the affine Gale diagram of the given polytope. This construction has the advantage, over the Gale transform, of using one less dimension to represent the structure of the given polytope., p. 43‚Äì44. Gale transforms and linear and affine Gale diagrams can also be described through the duality of oriented matroids., Definition 6.17, p. 168 As with the linear diagram, a subset of vertices forms a face if and only if there is no affine function (a linear function with a possibly nonzero constant term) that assigns a non-negative value to each positive vector in the complementary set and a non-positive value to each negative vector in the complementary set. Examples The Gale diagram is particularly effective in describing polyhedra whose numbers of vertices are only slightly larger than their dimensions. Simplices A d-dimensional polytope with n=d+1 vertices, the minimum possible, is a simplex. In this case, the linear Gale diagram is 0-dimensional, consisting only of zero vectors. The affine diagram has n gray points., p. 171. One additional vertex In a d-dimensional polytope with n=d+2 vertices, the linear Gale diagram is one- dimensional, with the vector representing each point being one of the three numbers -1, 0, or +1. In the affine diagram, the points are zero-dimensional, so they can be represented only by their signs or colors without any location value. In order to represent a polytope, the diagram must have at least two points with each nonzero sign. Two diagrams represent the same combinatorial equivalence class of polytopes when they have the same numbers of points of each sign, or when they can be obtained from each other by negating all of the signs. For d=2, the only possibility is two points of each nonzero sign, representing a convex quadrilateral. For d=3, there are two possible Gale diagrams: the diagram with two points of each nonzero sign and one zero point represents a square pyramid, while the diagram with two points of one nonzero sign and three points with the other sign represents the triangular bipyramid. In general, the number of distinct Gale diagrams with n=d+2, and the number of combinatorial equivalence classes of d-dimensional polytopes with n vertices, is \\\\lfloor d^2/4 \\\\rfloor. Two additional vertices In a d-dimensional polytope with n=d+3 vertices, the linear Gale diagram consists of points on the unit circle (unit vectors) and at its center. The affine Gale diagram consists of labeled points or clusters of points on a line. Unlike for the case of n=d+3 vertices, it is not completely trivial to determine when two Gale diagrams represent the same polytope. Three-dimensional polyhedra with six vertices provide natural examples where the original polyhedron is of a low enough dimension to visualize, but where the Gale diagram still provides a dimension-reducing effect. These include both the regular octahedron and the triangular prism. The linear Gale diagram of a regular octahedron consists of three pairs of equal points on the unit circle (representing pairs of opposite vertices of the octahedron), dividing the circle into arcs of angle less than \\\\pi. Its affine Gale diagram consists of three pairs of equal signed points on the line, with the middle pair having the opposite sign to the outer two pairs., Example 6.18, p. 169 The linear Gale diagram of a triangular prism consists of six points on the circle, in three diametrically opposed pairs, with each pair representing vertices of the prism that are adjacent on two square faces of the prism. The corresponding affine Gale diagram has three pairs of points on a line, like the regular octahedron, but with one point of each sign in each pair., pp. 39 and 44 Applications Gale diagrams have been used to provide a complete combinatorial enumeration of the d-dimensional polytope with n=d+3 vertices,, p. 121; , p. 172 and to construct polytopes that have unusual properties. Polytopes constructed in this way include: *The Perles polytope, an 8-dimensional polytope with 12 vertices that cannot be realized with rational Cartesian coordinates. This polytope was constructed by Micha Perles from the Perles configuration (nine points and nine lines in the plane that cannot be realized with rational coordinates) by doubling three of the points of the Perles configuration, assigning signs to the resulting 12 points, and treating the resulting signed configuration as the Gale diagram of a polytope. Although irrational polytopes are known with dimension as low as four, none are known with fewer vertices., Section 6.5(a) \\"A nonrational 8-polytope\\", pp. 172‚Äì173; , Theorem 6.11, pp. 51‚Äì52 *The Kleinschmidt polytope, a 4-dimensional polytope with 8 vertices, 10 tetrahedral facets, and one octahedral facet, constructed by Peter Kleinschmidt. Although the octahedral facet has the same combinatorial structure as a regular octahedron, it is not possible for it to be regular., Section 6.5(b) \\"Facets of 4-polytopes cannot be prescribed\\", pp. 173‚Äì175, and Exercise 6.18, p. 188; , pp. 129‚Äì130 Two copies of this polytope can be glued together on their octahedral facets to produce a 10-vertex polytope in which some pairs of realizations cannot be continuously deformed into each other., Section 6.5(d) \\"Polytopes violating the isotopy conjecture\\", pp. 177‚Äì179 *The bipyramid over a square pyramid is a 4-dimensional polytope with 7 vertices having the dual property, that the shape of one of its vertex figures (the apex of its central pyramid) cannot be prescribed. Originally found by David W. Barnette, this example was rediscovered by Bernd Sturmfels using Gale diagrams., Section 6.5(b) \\"Facets of 4-polytopes cannot be prescribed\\", pp. 173‚Äì175; , Proposition 5.1, p. 130; , Theorem 6.12, pp. 53‚Äì55 *The construction of small \\"unneighborly polytopes\\", that is, polytopes without a universal vertex, and \\"illuminated polytopes\\", in which every vertex is incident to a diagonal that passes through the interior of the polytope. The cross polytopes have these properties, but in 16 or more dimensions there exist illuminated polytopes with fewer vertices, and in 6 or more dimensions the illuminated polytopes with the fewest vertices need not be simplicial. The construction involves Gale diagrams.

The novel is a sequel to the events in Connelly's 2009 book The Scarecrow. Themes explored in the book include the decline of investigative journalism and the print-newspaper, the rise of fake news, the misogynistic incel movement, and the dangers of trafficking in DNA sequence data by an industry having no government oversight or regulations.

A. Fritsch, was an Australian architect best known for a series of Romanesque style red brick Catholic churches built across Victoria from the 1900s to the 1920s.  Early years  Augustus Andrew Fritsch was born in 1866 to Gustav Augustus Fritsch and Christina Fritsch (n√©e Holzer). The Fritsch‚Äôs were a pioneer family who had arrived in Australia in 1849. Gustav Augustus was a successful brickmaker, a partner of the Upper Hawthorn Brick Company, along with his in-laws, the Holzer brothers, begun in 1883. The factory employed around 50 people and produced 250,000 bricks a week, which were used throughout Victoria. The brickworks site in Hawthorn near Camberwell Junction eventually became a park in 1995, known as Fritsch Holzer Park. Fritsch began his architectural career by being articled to prolific architect John Beswicke, who lived locally in Hawthorn and designed many houses and shops in the area. At a young age he travelled through Europe and completed his training in the United States, before opening his own office in 1888 in Melbourne. Remaining in Hawthorn, in his early years he was particularly active in the Camberwell / Hawthorn area, designing several houses in the late 1880s and 1890s, including for instance a pair of boom-style cottages in 1890 for his uncle Anton Holzer at 13-19 Carnavon Street, next to the brickworks. In 1893 he married Alice Mason, from Bendigo.  Architectural career  The commission in 1894 for a presbytery for St Joseph‚Äôs in Malvern, in the form of a large verandahed Victorian style house, marked the start of his long association with the Catholic Church, designing churches, convents, halls, and schools across Victoria over the next 35 years. His first major church commission was replacing the church adjacent to his earlier presbytery at St Joseph‚Äôs in Malvern in 1908, which was designed in a striking broadly Romanesque form, in red brick with round arches, a rose window and a barrel vaulted interior, but also with details drawn from the Baroque like the paired cupolas, and a Flemish stepped gable. The red brick Romanesque Revival was a style adopted by other architects in this period for many Catholic projects, such as the grand St Joseph's in Benalla by Kempson & Connelly, also completed in 1908. Fritsch followed this trend in a more restrained manner than his first church, starting with St Joseph‚Äôs Rochester in 1910, which set the forms and details he used for his series red brick Romanesque churches over the next 20 years. These included the use of red brick with restrained rendered detailing, a tall gabled front with a central statuary niche and central window, banded voussoirs (first used at St Joseph‚Äôs), attached piers that rise up as spirelets, and stepped gables. St Brigids, Port Fairy (1914), St Marys Corowa (1921), St Marys Maffra (1924) Our Lady Of Mount Carmel, Middle Park (1928) all follow this form. St Marys, Yarram (1915), St Brendans, Flemington (1925) and St Columbas, Elwood (1929) are also similar, but with the addition of towers ‚Äì though only St Columba's was completed. He also designed some churches in a more standard Gothic Revival mode, including St Augustine's, Kyabram (1910), Immaculate Conception, Ararat (1928), as well as the tower of St Alpius Ballarat, the completion of an 1874 church in 1924. Another Gothic church which he added to while matching the earlier style was the landmark Immaculate Conception in Hawthorn, where he completed the transepts, adding a second, and vestries, complete with a small tower on busy Glenferrie Road, and completed the spire, in 1921. Our Lady of Victories in Camberwell is his best known and most interesting church; built 1913-18 it is a much more thorough example of the Romanesque Revival, with large round arched widows and simple massing, given added weight by the use of rough-faced sandstone, and is topped by a landmark copper dome. St Mary's, Bairnsdale is another very well known design, particularly for its landmark tower and painted interior, but only the rear half was built to his design in 1913, with the far taller tower than originally intended added by his son 20 years later. In 1915 he was named as one of the architects for Newman College at Melbourne University; the actual design is attributed to Walter Burley Griffin, with Fritsch in a supervisory role. Throughout this period, he also designed many other type of buildings such as chapels, church halls, convents, and school buildings, often new wings or extensions to existing sites, but also completely new ones, such as the Gothic style St Marys Convent, Beechworth, and the classically styled St Patricks College, Sale.  Later life  Fritsch‚Äôs son, who was also A A (Augustus Alfonso) Fritsch (1882-1973), was trained in his father‚Äôs office, and worked with him throughout his period of church work. He was finally was made partner of the firm in 1932, just before his father‚Äôs death aged 67 in 1933. Augustus Alfonso renamed the firm Fritsch & Fritsch and continued the long association with the Catholic Church, though far less prolific. He is best known for the front and lofty tower added to his father‚Äôs earlier St Mary's, Bairnsdale in 1936.

Season Before the season began, Harvard made a decision to end their annual contests against Princeton. The two teams had played one another, often multiple times, every year since 1901 with exception of the 1918 campaign (due to World War I). The problem was that Princeton hadn't challenged for a league championship since before the War, which was also the last time they had beaten Harvard in the season series. Harvard was also able to fill the gap in their schedule with the return of Brown after a 20-year hiatus. A bigger issue that Harvard had to contend with was a new rule limiting each team to just 12 players per game. While that didn't affect most programs, the Crimson had been routinely using many alternates during their games, resulting in 15 or more players in some contests. Regardless of the new limitations, Harvard began the season well. After a solid win over MIT the team played three games against Canadian colleges and finished with a split decision, a difficult task considering the quality of their opponents. Unfortunately, the team also lost sophomore forward Henry Crosby to appendicitis just before the second Toronto game. After proving their international mettle, Harvard played its first ever western opponent when it hosted Notre Dame. The Crimson dominated the Irish 7‚Äì0 but little beyond that could be established from the game as Notre Dame wasn't a particularly strong team that season. Harvard avenged a loss from the year before with a hard- fought victory over Boston University then entered their showdown against Yale with a chance at another intercollegiate title. The Crimson offense overpowered the Elis in the first game, and after securing a season-series win over Dartmouth with a tie, Harvard finished the season at the newly- refurbished New Haven Arena. Harvard built a 2-goal lead and then played their typical stifling defense to earn a 2‚Äì1 win and finish the season undefeated against collegiate opponents. A day after the victory, head coach Edward Bigelow announced that he was resigning from his position to devote himself fully to his business career. Though his tenure was short, few could claim as much success as Bigelow did with two intercollegiate championships and a record of 25‚Äì8‚Äì2 (22‚Äì3‚Äì1 against collegiate opponents).

Life  Born in D√ºsseldorf,Date of birth and full name are based on the singer's personal file as a professor filled out by her own hand in 1950 (Archive of the \\"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\\" Academy of Music and Theatre, formerly the Academy of Music Leipzig). The Gro√ües S√§ngerlexikon mentions 25 May 1898 as her date of birth. Neither of these dates can be verified according to the D√ºsseldorf registry office., B√§umer trained her soprano voice in D√ºsseldorf and Cologne and made her debut in 1920 at the Stadttheater Barmen (later Opernhaus Wuppertal). After stations in D√ºsseldorf, Zurich, Stuttgart, Berlin (St√§dtische Oper Berlin), Nuremberg and Mannheim, she came to the Opernhaus Leipzig in 1934, where she quickly became a darling of the public and then worked as a leading dramatic soprano until 1953. At the same time, she had engagements at the Bavarian State Opera (1934-1937) and at the Wroc≈Çaw Opera.Margarete B√§umer on Operavivra At the Staatsoper Stuttgart, B√§umer switched to the dramatic repertoire in the mid-1920s and from then on was increasingly celebrated as a Wagner singer. On the occasion of an engagement at the German Grand Opera Society in New York, she performed on tour on all major North American stages. Innumerable guest performances at the opera houses of Europe followed in addition to her regular engagements. Thus she sang - mainly in Wagnerian roles - in Vienna (Staatsoper), Brussels, Dresden (Staatsoper), Basel, Geneva, Paris, Barcelona, Zurich, Prague, Riga, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Venice, Palermo, Turin and Palermo. She appeared at the Munich Opera Festival in 1935 (as Elektra) and 1936 (as Br√ºnnhilde), and at the Sopot International Song Festival in 1938 (as Br√ºnnhilde).Margarete B√§umer on Frauenpers√∂nlichkeiten in Leipzig (in German) Although B√§umer continued to perform from 1954 onwards (in 1960 for the last time in Leipzig), from that year on, she was mainly a professor at the Academy of Music in Leipzig.

The term is derived from the Hindi word padhna, meaning \\"to read, study or recite\\". Padhant is closely associated with the percussion instrument tabla and the classical dance Kathak, and the recitation of rhythmic patterns before playing them is considered an art in itself. The dancer in Kathak would pause at intervals to recite the rhythms before executing them through dance. The recitation is often accompanied by hand gestures. The recited syllables are also used in storytelling, creating an atmosphere or inducing a mood in the audience; for example, in a performance of Kalidasa's Meghaduta (Cloud Messenger), the sounds ghe-ghe-thi-ta can signify a rumble of clouds or, its expanded version, the arrival of clouds. In Carnatic music, a similar concept is called konnakol.

As a result, an alternative method had to be designed and implemented at short notice to determine the qualification grades to be given to students for that year. A grades standardisation algorithm was produced in June 2020 by the regulator Ofqual. The algorithm was designed to combat grade inflation, and was to be used to moderate the existing but unpublished teacher-predicted grades for A Level and GCSE students. After the A Level grades were issued, and after criticism, Ofqual, with the support of HM Government, withdrew these grades. It issued all students the Centre Assessment Grades (CAGs), which had been produced by teachers as part of the process. The same ruling was applied to the awarding of GCSE grades, just a few days before they were issued: CAG- based grades were the ones released on results day. A similar controversy erupted in Scotland, after the Scottish Qualifications Authority marked down as many as 75,000 exam papers to \\"maintain credibility\\", and later agreed to upgrade the results and issue new exam certificates. The Scottish Government apologised for the controversy, with Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland saying of the situation that the Scottish Government \\"did not get it right\\".  Background  In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, students sit General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) and A Level exams, typically at ages 16 and 18 respectively. These exams are also administered by Cambridge Assessment International Education for students in countries such as Hong Kong, India and Singapore. On 18 March 2020, the government decided to cancel all examinations in England due to the COVID-19 pandemic, although the regulator, Ofqual, had advised that holding exams in a socially distanced manner was the best option. The same cancellation decision was taken by the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland devolved governments. The governments announced that, in their place, grades were to be based on teacher predictions which would be moderated to prevent grade inflation. Overseas exams provided by CIE were cancelled on 23 March 2020, and grades were issued on the same basis as in England. Secretary of State for Education Gavin Williamson stated that his \\"priority now is to ensure no young person faces a barrier when it comes to moving on to the next stage of their lives ‚Äì whether that‚Äôs further or higher education, an apprenticeship or a job\\" and that he had \\"asked exam boards to work closely with the teachers who know their pupils best to ensure their hard work and dedication is rewarded and fairly recognised.\\" Students unhappy with their calculated grades would be able to appeal through their school, or sit exams in the autumn. For homeschooled students, or those retaking exams, Ofqual stated they may not receive a grade, and would have to sit exams in 2021 because of a \\"lack of any credible alternatives identified\\". It was estimated that over 20,000 students would be affected, and would be unable to move on to college or university.  Standardisation algorithm  A grades standardisation algorithm was produced by Ofqual, the regulator of qualifications, exams and tests in England. It was designed to combat grade inflation, and was to be used to standardise or moderate the teacher-predicted grades for A Level and GCSE qualifications.  A Level results  The A Level grades were announced in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 13 August 2020. Nearly 36% were one grade lower than teachers' predictions and 3% were down two grades. By comparison, 79% of university entrants in 2019 did not achieve their predicted grades.  Reaction  The release of results resulted in a public outcry. Particular criticism was made of the disparate effect the grading algorithm had in downgrading the results of those who attended state schools, and upgrading the results of pupils at privately funded independent schools and thus disadvantaging pupils of a lower socio- economic background, in part due to the algorithm's behaviour around small cohort sizes. Students and teachers felt deprived and upset following the controversial algorithm calculation and protested against it, with many demanding Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his government take immediate action. In response to the public outcry, on 15 August, Gavin Williamson said that the grading system is here to stay, and there will be \\"no U-turn, no change\\". Williamson criticised Scottish ministers for their u-turn the week prior, stating that awarding unmoderated grades would be \\"unwise\\", cause \\"rampant grade inflation\\". Instead, he suggested that schools appeal swiftly on behalf of affected students, to ensure any errors could be amended. Boris Johnson stated that the results are \\"robust and dependable\\". Legal action, in the form of judicial review, was initiated by multiple students and legal advocacy organisations such as the Good Law Project.  A Level results revised  On 17 August, Ofqual and Secretary of State for Education Gavin Williamson agreed that grades would be reissued using unmoderated teacher predictions. As a result, there was an annual increase by more than 10 percentage points in the number of top grades awarded (from 25.2% to an estimated 37.7%), the biggest increase for at least 20 years.  GCSE results  On 20 August 2020 the GCSE results were released. After the problems arising from the use of the grade algorithm for A Levels, it was decided that GCSE grades awarded to each student would be the higher of the teacher predicted result or algorithm standardised result for each subject they took.  Vocational and technical qualifications (BTEC) results  A further 200,000 students who had taken the level one and two vocational qualifications were told on 19 August 2020, hours before results day, that they would not receive them on time. About 250,000 level-three grades, which had already been awarded, were also reassessed; these vocational equivalents to A Levels had been given a result at the same time as the A Levels were released. The examining board, Pearson Edexcel, withdrew them when the controversy broke, and has re-marked them upwards and is issuing a revised certificate, on a rolling basis, in the week beginning 24 August.  Aftermath  On 25 August 2020, Sally Collier resigned from the position of chief regulator of Ofqual following the grading controversy. Three days later, Permanent Secretary Jonathan Slater, the most senior civil servant at the Department for Education (DfE), stood down. Subsequently, the government was accused of scapegoating civil servants and avoiding accountability. On 1 September, the question of blame was reopened by The Guardian. In a report OCR, one of the exam boards, told Williamson that the algorithm was producing some rogue results. But Williamson and the DfE were told by Ofqual that the appeals procedure would correct the few rogue results. OCR informed them that this was more that a few results and that patterns could be observed, such as students with better results than a low-performing group the year before. On 2 September, Ofqual's chair Roger Taylor appeared before the Education Select Committee of the House of Commons during their inquiry into the impact of COVID-19 on education and children's services. He apologised to students, parents and teachers, and stated that the Secretary of State made the decisions to cancel examinations and to abruptly withdraw the procedure to challenge calculated A-level grades. Scottish Highers On 4 August 2020, secondary school students in Scotland received their Higher grades. Having also been unable to take their exams because of the pandemic, their grades were estimated by teachers, but the body awarding the qualifications was reported to have downgraded around a quarter of the marks awarded in order to \\"maintain credibility\\". Following criticism of the system from teachers and students, on 10 August, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon apologised for the controversy, saying the Scottish Government \\"did not get it right\\". The following day, on 11 August, the Scottish Government agreed to upgrade thousands of exam results, and accept teachers' estimates of pupils' results. On 18 August, the Scottish Qualifications Authority announced that 75,000 new exam certificates would be issued.

The event was also billed as \\"Night of Champions\\", where the fans decided the opponents of the defending champions at the event. No fans were in attendance at Arena M√©xico due to limitations from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the show was broadcast as an internet pay-per-view on Ticketmaster Live. The show is normally the biggest show of the year for CMLL, considered their version of the Super Bowl or WrestleMania. This is the 93rd EMLL/CMLL Anniversary Show as there were two shows held in 1963, 1966, 1972, 1975, 1977, but none in 1985. The CMLL Anniversary Show series is the longest- running annual professional wrestling show, starting in 1934.  Production = Background  Arena M√©xico, CMLL's main venue and location of the 87th Anniversary Show The Mexican Lucha libre (professional wrestling) company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) started out under the name Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (\\"Mexican Wrestling Company\\"; EMLL), founded by Salvador Lutteroth in 1933. Lutteroth, inspired by professional wrestling shows he had attended in Texas, decided to become a wrestling promoter and held his first show on September 21, 1933, marking what would be the beginning of organized professional wrestling in Mexico. Lutteroth would later become known as \\"the father of Lucha Libre\\" . A year later EMLL held the EMLL 1st Anniversary Show, starting the annual tradition of the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre Anniversary Shows that have been held each year ever since, most commonly in September. Over the years the anniversary show would become the biggest show of the year for CMLL, akin to the Super Bowl for the National Football League (NFL) or WWE's WrestleMania event. The first anniversary show was held in Arena Modelo, which Lutteroth had bought after starting EMLL. In 1942‚Äì43 Lutteroth financed the construction of Arena Coliseo, which opened in April 1943. The EMLL 10th Anniversary Show was the first of the anniversary shows to be held in Arena Coliseo. In 1956 Lutteroth had Arena M√©xico built in the location of the original Arena Modelo, making Arena M√©xico the main venue of EMLL from that point on. Starting with the EMLL 23rd Anniversary Show, all anniversary shows except for the EMLL 46th Anniversary Show have been held in the arena that would become known as \\"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\\". On occasion EMLL held more than one show labeled as their \\"Anniversary\\" show, such as two 33rd Anniversary Shows in 1966. Over time the anniversary show series became the oldest, longest-running annual professional wrestling show. In comparison, WWE's WrestleMania is only the fourth oldest still promoted show (CMLL's Arena Coliseo Anniversary Show and Arena M√©xico anniversary shows being second and third). EMLL was supposed to hold the EMLL 52nd Anniversary Show on September 20, 1985, but Mexico City was hit by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. EMLL canceled the event both because of the general devastation but also over fears that Arena M√©xico might not be structurally sound after the earthquake. When Jim Crockett Promotions was bought by Ted Turner in 1988 EMLL became the oldest still active promotion in the world. In 1991 EMLL was rebranded as \\"Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre\\" and thus held the CMLL 59th Anniversary Show, the first under the new name, on September 18, 1992. Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, replacing their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. CMLL stopped promoting shows in March 2020 due to guidelines issued by the Mexican government due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This meant that CMLL did not hold any shows between March 14 and July 30, 2020. CMLL later announced that they would return to promoting their CMLL Super Viernes shows every Friday, starting on September 4. The September 4th, 11th and 19th Super Viernes shows would be empty arena matches, broadcast as internet Pay-Per-View (iPPV) events on Ticketmaster Live, followed by the 87th Anniversary show, held on September 25th as an empty arena iPPV. CMLL announced that the show would be a \\"Night of Champions\\" show where fans could vote on who they would want to challenge for various CMLL championships. Storylines The 87th Anniversary Show will feature seven professional wrestling matches scripted by CMLL with some wrestlers involved in scripted feuds. The wrestlers portray either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that play the part of the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they perform. For the 87th Anniversary Show, CMLL announced that they would let the fans vote for who would challenge reigning CMLL champions at the \\"Night of Champions\\" themed show.

CMLL held a fan poll to determine a replacement for Caverario, necessitated by the team leading the overall poll. Voters chose Templario over Vangelis or Dark Magic, to replace Cavernario. Templario was also listed in the polls for the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship but was far behind the top vote- getter. In the end the team of Templario, El Terrible, and Hechicero won the vote, with enough votes to have them work the second match of the night. The right to challenge for the CMLL World Women's Championship was originally won by Princesa Sugehit, but on September 16 Sugehit announced that she had tested positive for COVID-19 and thus was forced to isolate and could not compete in the anniversary show. CMLL opted to have the second-highest vote winner, Dalys, challenge for the title instead, while Pricesa Sugehit was promised a championship match in October once she was out of quarantine. La Met√°lica's challenger was a choice between Lluvia, Reyna Isis, La Jarocita, and La Estrellita. The fan vote selected Lluvia to wrestle for the Mexican National Women's Championship. On September 21 it was revealed that Lluvia had tested positive for COVID-19, albeit asymptomatic, and thus was not able to compete. In her place, Reyna Isis was given the match due to her position as the first runner-up in the fan vote. It was announced that Lluvia would get her championship match at a later date after her quarantine was over. On September 23, CMLL announced that both Bandido and √öltimo Guerrero had both tested positive for COVID-19 and were off the show. As the runner up in the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship Templario was announced as Bandido's replacement. As Guerrero was taken off the show, CMLL replaced the CMLL World Trios Championship match with a match for the CMLL World Welterweight Championship, with Tit√°n defending against the reigning Mexican National Welterweight Champion Soberano Jr. Both championship matches were announced as taking place at some point in October.

She led a society who believed in a flat earth. She conducted convincing, but flawed, experiments to prove this. Life Blount was born in Lambeth in 1850. Her parents were Elizabeth Ann (born Mould) and James Zacharias Williams who was a keen supporter of London clubs. She was tutored at home. She developed wide interests in art, science, social responsibility and London's society and intelligentsia. She married Sir Walter de Sodington Blount, ninth baronet and they raised a family at the family seat of Mawley Hall. She would spend time there and at their house in London where she was a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and the Society of Antiquaries. After Samuel Rowbotham's death in 1884, Blount became the President of the Universal Zetetic Society, whose objective was \\"the propagation of knowledge related to Natural Cosmogony in confirmation of the Holy Scriptures, based on practical scientific investigation\\". Blount's title and money was said to have attracted an archbishop, several colonels, a Major-General to the membership. The society published a magazine, The Earth Not a Globe Review, and remained active well into the early 20th century. A flat Earth journal, Earth: a Monthly Magazine of Sense and Science, was published between 1901 and 1904, edited by Lady Blount. In 1898 she published a novel titled Adrian Galilio, or a Song Writer's Story. The Flat Earth Society says that it concerns \\"an aristocrat who escapes her unhappy marriage and reinvents herself as a world-famous Flat Earth proponent who 'tours Europe giving elaborate lectures on cosmology, the creation, true love and hell'\\". Blount and her husband wanted to provide evidence of the earth's flat surface and they created experiments on the Old Bedford Level Canal over several weeks. Picture of the Bedford Level: \\"Carried out in misty and very unsatisfactory weather, on May 11th, 1904, before Lady Blount and several scientific gentlemen\\". On 11 May 1904 Lady Elizabeth Anne Blount, hired a photographer to use a telephoto-lens camera to take a picture from Welney of a large white sheet she had placed, the bottom edge near the surface of the river, at Rowbotham's original position away. The photographer, Edgar Clifton from Dallmeyer's studio, mounted his camera above the water at Welney and was surprised to be able to obtain a picture of the target, which he believed should have been invisible to him, given the low mounting point of the camera. Lady Blount published the pictures far and wide. Blount's letter did not discuss the effects of atmospheric refraction but the photographer noted a mirage which he described as \\"an aqueous shimmering vapour [appearing] to float unevenly on the surface of the canal\\". These controversies became a regular feature in the English Mechanic magazine in 1904‚Äì05, which published Blount's photo and reported two experiments in 1905 that showed the opposite results. One of these, by Clement Stratton on the Ashby Canal, showed a dip on a sight-line only above the surface. When she was 73, on 28 August 1923, she married again to a builder and evangelist named Stephen Morgan who was forty years younger than her. She was a member of the \\"Society for the Protection of the Dark Races\\" and she gave that her active support. Blount died in Hayling Island.

Founded by French chef Julien Royer in 2015, Odette features a fusion of French cuisine with Asian influences. The restaurant has received numerous awards, most notably three Michelin stars, as well winning first place in Asia's 50 Best Restaurants in 2020.  Description  Odette is a 3100-square-foot restaurant located in the Supreme Court wing of the National Gallery Singapore. It serves French cuisine with Asian influences. Chef Julien Royer named his restaurant in honor of his grandmother, who taught him how to cook. He credits his grandmother and her cooking philosophies for inspiring him to become a chef, saying, \\"she taught me about respecting produce, about approaching cooking in a simple fashion, and how to elevate each ingredient like a piece of art.\\" In coming up with the concept for his restaurant, Royer wanted to offer modern fine dining French cuisine, without the \\"stiff, unwelcoming\\" atmosphere stereotypical of a fine dining experience. Odette can seat up to 32 people, not including an additional twelve-person private room, and a chef's table for four inside the kitchen. Initially, the chef's table was reserved for Royer's close friends, but he eventually opened it up to the public. The design of the restaurant was overseen by Sacha Leong, a designer from London firm Universal Design Studio. Leong used white and light shades of pink to decorate the room. Singaporean artist Dawn Ng, who is married to Royer's business partner Wee Teng Wen, created a hanging installation in the main dining area called A Theory of Everything. Inspired by Royer's focus on simplicity in the kitchen, Ng took printed photographs of ingredients, sticking them onto oak panels and folding them. Signature dishes at Odette include rosemary smoked organic eggs, mushroom tea, and a dish consisting of variations on the heirloom beetroot. According to Royer, the restaurant strives to pay tribute to his childhood by using the best ingredients sourced from small producers worldwide, sourcing ingredients from Australia, Japan, and as far away as Europe. He states, \\"I like that it falls between the range of tradition and innovation‚Äîfood that‚Äôs tasty and uses classic cooking techniques, but is interpreted in a modern way.\\" Royer also claims that food waste at Odette is minimized, due to the care put into designing the menu to use as much of the ingredients as possible.  History  Odette was established in 2015 by Royer. Originally from Auvergne, France, he was previously the head chef of Jaan at the Swiss√¥tel The Stamford. While working at Jaan, regular customer Chong Siak Ching, the CEO of the National Gallery, asked if Royer would be interested in occupying an available space at the museum. After meeting with a business partner, he agreed after a couple of weeks to open his own restaurant there, resigning from his position at Jaan in June 2015. Construction on the restaurant began sometime that summer, costing an estimated seven figures. In October, it was announced that Royer and managing partner Wee Teng Wen, of Lo & Behold Group, would be opening Odette in the National Gallery on November 2nd. Wee had previously met Royer through mutual friends, and had discussed opening a restaurant together as early as 2014. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Royer made adaptations to his business, installing air and surface purification systems inside the restaurant, and implementing curbside pickup for take-out orders. The take-out service, Odette at Home, gives people the opportunity to order a multi-course meal from a curated list of menu items, without needing to visit the restaurant in-person.  Reception  Odette is well-received by critics. Annette Tan of the Cond√© Nast Traveler claims that \\"restaurant obsessives consider Odette one of the best dining experiences in the world.\\" The Straits Times' Wong Ah Yoke describes the atmosphere as \\"classy yet not ostentatious\\", and that the neutral color scheme is \\"contemporary, soothing and elegant\\". Both Tan and Wong enjoyed the food. Tan notes that \\"every dish is artful, complex, and most importantly delicious.\\" Wong likes the \\"excellent\\" Kushiro flounder and \\"juicy\\" Challans Guineafowl. Odette also received several awards since its debut. In its first year of opening, it won the \\"Best New Restaurant\\" award at the G Restaurant Awards. It later won \\"Restaurant of the Year\\" at the same awards in 2018. The restaurant got its first accolades by the Michelin Guide in 2016, receiving two stars. It later received three stars in 2019. In 2020, Odette received first place in Asia's 50 Best Restaurants. It first made its appearance on the list in ninth place in 2017, winning \\"The Highest New Entry Award\\". It then moved up the Asian rankings to fifth place in 2018. On the worldwide rankings, The World's 50 Best Restaurants, it debuted at 86th place in the 2017 list. moving its way up to 28th by 2018, and 18th by 2019. For his role in the kitchen at Odette, Royer won the \\"Chef of the Year\\" award at the World Gourmet Summit in 2017. He had previously won the award in 2014 while at Jaan. Odette also won \\"Restaurant of the Year\\" and \\"Old World Wine List of the Year\\" at the 2019 World Gourmet Summit awards.

The decision to have Armstrong record his vocals separately from the instrumental backing led Chadbourne to describe the music as \\"just rhythm run- throughs, with Armstrong singing, mumbling, and commenting over the top; the instrumental parts are devoid of any flair or commitment whatsoever\\" and that the \\"resulting lack of any sort of sympathy or communication between Armstrong and the accompanying musicians is simply a total death blow\\".

Boiler factory and the Newbie Brick and Tile Works at Newbie. The Newbie Siding branched off near the halt and was accessed from the west.  History  Terraced housing at Newbie Village. The halt was not open to the general public and only served workers at the factories served by the Newbie Branch. Trains served this workers halt in the morning and evening. It is not recorded if workers were taken to their destination by rail or whether they walked the short half-mile, however it seems unlikely given the short distance and a passenger carriage would be required and a platform of some description at the end of the line. The Newbie Brick and Tile Works had closed and the track lifted by 1929Dumfriesshire LXII.11 (Annan;Cummertrees) Publication date:1931 Revised:1929 and terraced housing was constructed for the boiler factory employees. The halt opened around 1898 and was closed around 1904. Operation In 1898 the key for Newbie Junction was kept in an Annan railway station signal box and the Newbie Junction box was opened as required by a porter travelling by train from Annan. In 1898 no trains were permitted to call at Newbie Branch Junction during foggy weather or between sunset and sunrise unless the Main Line and Branch Signals were lit.

As of 2020 he has an understanding of 20 languages, though his ability to speak and write in them to a highly proficient level varies considerably.  Background  Kaufmann was born in Sweden in 1945 to parents from the town of Prostƒõjov in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now in the Czech Republic. His parents were bilingual in both Czech and German. At the age of five, in 1951, the family moved to Montreal, Canada, where he grew up. In June 1962, Kaufmann quit his construction job and looked to find a ship in the docks he could work on in exchange for taking him to Europe. On his third attempt at asking, he was given a job aboard the German tramp steamer, the Gerda Schell, which had lost a sailor in Quebec City. He arrived in London ten days later. After a week there he caught a ferry at Dover and landed in Ostend, Belgium, before heading to France. After a year living in Grenoble, he continued studying politics at the L'Institut d'√âtudes Politiques (Institute of Political Studies) and learning French in Paris. Kaufmann hitchhiked through Europe after his studies, picking up basic language skills in Spain, Italy and Germany. He went on to join the Canadian diplomatic service, where he began learning Mandarin in Hong Kong in 1969, and became fluent in it within a year of full-time studying. When re-posted to the Canadian embassy in Japan in the early 1970s, he had to learn Japanese. Moving from his role as a trade commissioner, he then used his language ability in commercial trade, living in Japan for 9 years.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZF0djgU704&feature;=youtu.be&t;=1510&ab;_channel=LucaLampariello Eventually, mainly later in life, he started learning more languages.  Current work  Kaufmann appears at conferences to speak on his language learning techniques and abilities. He also runs a number of social media channels discussing his experiences of language learning and suggested techniques, both of which focus on language learning techniques and assisting people who are learning language. He was one of the founding organisers of the North American Polyglot symposium. Kaufmann travels to learn languages, and has given numerous interviews in native languages on various television channels around the world, in languages such as Chinese, Russian and Ukrainian. He has been a regular contributor to the Huffington Post.  Language learning  Kaufmann has been studying languages for over 50 years. He advocates total immersion in the learning process. He places great emphasis on absorbing the language by reading text and not worrying too much about unfamiliar words, believing that they will gradually be acquired through repeated reading. Though he advocates using techniques such as flashcards to memorize difficult words, most of his learning time goes into listening to native speakers and reading texts. He is particularly fond of reading books on the history of the country or region of the language he is learning in the native language. He is an advocate for older people learning, and states that age is not necessarily an impediment to learning a language. He also recognizes mistakes as a natural part of the learning process, and believes that people can still be considered fluent even with some mistakes. Kaufmann started to learn Russian, his 9th language, when he was 60. As of 2020 he has an understanding of 20 languages, though his ability to speak and write in them to a highly proficient level varies considerably. He has stated that he rarely writes in the languages, and that revisiting acquired languages he is out of practice in can be challenging initially when interacting with a native speaker. The languages he speaks aside from English are: French, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), Japanese, Korean, Russian, Swedish, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Ukrainian, Czech, Slovak, Romanian, Polish, Greek, Turkish, Arabic and Farsi.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAePyl33gOQ&ab;_channel=SteveKaufmann- lingosteve As of 2020 he stated that after studying Turkish he is now focusing on learning Arabic and Farsi, and spends time listening to Arabic TV series and Al Jazeera news, and reading books on Arabic and Persian history.

Like other black women playwrights such as Jackie Kay and Jacqueline Rudet, Chowdhry was helped by the appointment of the black woman producer Frances-Anne Solomon to BBC Radio 4. Chowdhry's first play, Monsoon (1993), was broadcast as part of the BBC Young Playwrights' Festival. Monsoon portrays the return of sisters Jalaarnava and Kavitaa, two second-generation migrant young women, to their parents' birthplace in India. The play parallels the experience of menstruation with waiting for the seasonal monsoon. Chowdhry's play Kaahini (1997) was toured by Red Ladder, as one of a series of plays aimed primarily at Asian-British girls. Influenced by the story of Shikhandi in the Mahabharata, the play dramatizes a gender reversal narrative: a British Indian teenage girl, Esha, is brought up by her parents as a boy. After a close friend Farooq falls in love with Esha, she reveals herself to him as a girl and is forced to work through her gender identity.

Offending religious feelings () is a blasphemy law in Poland. According to Article 196 of the Penal Code: \\"Whoever offends the religious feelings of other persons by publicly insulting an object of religious worship, or a place designated for public religious ceremonies, is liable to pay a fine, have his or her liberty limited, or be deprived of his or her liberty for a period of up to two years.\\"Application no. 8257/13 , European Court of Human Rights Constitutionality A law forbidding blasphemy was included in the original 1932 Polish penal code. The Constitutional Tribunal has ruled that the law is not in conflict with the Constitution of Poland and is not overbroad. The European Court of Human Rights has also allowed other blasphemy laws under margin of appreciation doctrine, as individual countries have broad ability to set moral standards. Polish law has no provision which exempts or reduces the scrutiny applied to artistic expression alleged to violate the law, although many artists who have been accused of violating it say that their work should be protected as artistic freedom. A separate law, Article 256, criminalizes incitement to hatred based on religious belief. Cases The majority of cases in which charges of Article 196 are made do not lead to actual convictions. About 55 prosecutions on average were brought each year between 1999 and 2016. Since Poland is a predominantly Catholic country (around 87% of Poles say they were baptized as Catholics), most Article 196 cases concern that religion. In 2000, Polish artist Dorota Nieznalska juxtaposed Greek cross with male genitalia in an artistic exhibition. In 2009 she was finally acquitted after lengthy legal proceedings, due to the court not finding an intent to offend religious feelings. Hellfest 2010 In 2008, musician Adam Darski tore up a Bible during a performance, referring to it as \\"the book of lies\\". He was acquitted after the performance was deemed not to be sufficiently public, the audience had bought tickets and consented to the performance, and only one audience member complained. After his acquittal, Darski announced his intention to hold \\"Satanist communion\\" during performances. In 2009, singer Dorota Rabczewska (Doda) referred to the Bible as \\"something written by individuals high on alcohol and weed\\". She was convicted and fined. The case Rabczewska v. Poland is currently pending before the European Court of Human Rights. In 2015, Robert Biedro≈Ñ, mayor of S≈Çupsk, was investigated for removing a portrait of John Paul II from his office after PiS activists reported him for allegedly offending religious feelings. In 2019, El≈ºbieta Podle≈õna was arrested for displaying a Rainbow Madonna adaptation of the Black Madonna of Czƒôstochowa. In July 2020, Podle≈õna and two other activists were formally charged with offending religious feelings; they pled not guilty. and Amnesty International criticized the use of the law. In October 2019, Bishop Szymon Niemiec of the United Ecumenical Church was interrogated by police under suspicion of offending religious feelings \\"by insulting the object of worship in the form of a Roman Catholic Mass\\"; police had received more than 150 complaints regarding the incident. He had held an ecumenical, LGBT-inclusive religious service in connection with Warsaw's 2019 Equality Parade, which was criticized by the Roman Catholic Episcopal Conference of Poland and Law and Justice politicians. Niemiec previously held similar services every year since 2010 without controversy. Niemiec and Julia Maciocha, president of the committee which organizes Equality Parade, stated that the complaint against Niemiec violates the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion. Repeal attempts The law is controversial in Poland. Lawyers have noted that it is excessively vague, not stating what actions count as \\"offending religious feelings\\", leading some to call for repeal of the law. Opponents of the law say that it has a chilling effect on legitimate free speech and criticism of religion. It has been criticized for violating free speech by human rights watchdogs such as Article 19, Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, End Blasphemy Laws, and Amnesty International. The Council of Europe's Recommendation 1805 urges member states to repeal blasphemy laws. Anne Ramberg and Michael Kirby of the International Bar Association‚Äôs Human Rights Institute stated that the law was overbroad, conflicting with Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and was used unfairly to target LGBT rights advocates. In 2019, MP of Modern submitted legislation that would have abolished the offense. Referencing Podle≈õna's arrest, he said that Article 196 \\"has become a political tool today\\" and was an \\"oppressive article that has repeatedly limited creative freedom\\". Robert Biedro≈Ñ, leader of Spring, said that his party aims to repeal the offense if elected. Biedro≈Ñ added that the law and arrest of Podle≈õna made Poland internationally \\"famous for the idiotic attitude of today's rulers who go after artists and those who enjoy freedom of speech\\".

This monument belongs to the \\"architectural\\" category, approved with number 414/77 and is under state protection. The Complex is now home to photographs, documents, objects, clothings and other cultural artifacts that date from the time of the League of Prizren.  History  Th√´ Monumental Complex of the Albanian League of Prizren is an urbanistic and architectural ensemble, geographically located in the old city centre, with special cultural, historical, societal and environmental values. The complex was shaped with the construction of the Gazi Mehmet Pasha's Mosque, and around it, other buildings were developed, such as the League Building, the Medrese (School), Library, Turbe and residential buildings, which are mainly spread through the south-western area of the Gazi Mehmed Pasha's Complex, within which we have the Memorial Complex of the Prizren League. These folk architecture buildings are found individually and in series. By the end of the 19th century, and the early 20th century, restoration and reconstruction works in residential buildings clearly feature European Baroque styles, with a hint of Neo-Classicism, which provides a specific image to these buildings. After the 50-es of 20th century, mass demolitions were made, in the name of road expansion, and the Lumbardh River was reshaped for ‚Äúmodernizing‚Äù the city. From this complex, only a few preserved buildings remain, while some parts of the Medrese (School) were also destroyed. In 1968, due to the road construction, several buildings along the river were demolished, while the residential building of the Albanian League of Prizren was relocated for several meters west. Again, in 1976-‚Äô78, major interventions were made, thereby demolishing several buildings in the area of Memorial Complex of the Albanian Prizren League, with aim to reconstruct the Museum of the Prizren League, for its 100th Anniversary. During the 1999 war, the League Building was entirely demolished due to fire, and was reconstructed by June 2000. Now, the Museum Complex of the Prizren League is made of three sectors: #The Albanian League of Prizren Residence, a historical sector, with the history of the League, featuring written documents, old weapons and paintings of historical and political figures of the League; #The Medrese (School), with an ethnographic sector in its ground floor, characteristic adornments from Albanian-inhabited areas; and #The upper floor of Medrese, with the Art Gallery, featuring paintings of the personalities of the Albanian League of Prizren.

The company is specialised in import, export and distribution of fresh organic fruits and vegetables. Eosta imports overseas fruits from Africa, South America, Oceania, Asia and North America. In 2017 Eosta's CEO, Volkert Engelsman, was elected Most Influential Sustainability Voice of the Netherlands in the yearly sustainability top-100 list by newspaper Trouw, who called him \\"a greengrocer with a radical vision\\"..  Name  The name Eosta contains the Greek word \\"Eos\\", the goddess of sunrise.  History  Eosta was founded in 1990 by Dutch entrepreneurs Volkert Engelsman and Willem van Wijk, in response to new rising demand in supermarkets for fresh organic food produce as well as the growth of the health food sector. Since then the company grew to be a major player in the European market for organic fruits and vegetables, exporting to Germany, the UK, Scandinavia, Belgium, France and other European countries, as well as the United States, Singapore and Hong Kong. In 2007 its subsidiary Soil & More Impacts was founded, an agricultural consultancy enterprise.  Transparency and Sustainability Nature & More is a consumer trademark and online transparency system used by Eosta. Nature & More started out in 2004 as a nonprofit foundation, but was later integrated into the company . Products with the Nature & More brand carry a QR-code or a three-digit code, which buyers can enter on a website to access information about the organic grower behind the product. This allows them to inform themselves about the impact of the product on different aspects of ecological and social sustainability, which are measured by a GRI-based model called the Sustainability Flower. The transparency system won a Sustainable Entrepreneurship Award in Vienna, Austria, in 2013 . The Sustainability Flower, linked to the United Nation's Social Development Goals (SDGs) The Sustainability Flower is the model for sustainability that Eosta uses to, as they say, \\"measure, manage, market and monetise\\" the impact of production on natural capital and social capital. The model was developed by an international group of companies and NGO's in 2009 . Other companies in the organic field such as SEKEM (Egypt) and Soil & More Impacts (Germany) use the same model, but with a different graphic interpretation . Eosta's version of the Sustainability Flower has seven petals which each stand for a different aspect of ecological and social sustainability. These are evaluated quantitatively by Key Point Indicators based on GRI standards. The Sustainability Flower is used to assess the performance of organic farmers and growers. Subsequently, True Cost Accounting is used to put a monetary value to these impacts. According to Volker Engelsman, the company \\"[...] serves an awareness elite, people who are concerned about health, the environment, social issues. We don't try to compete with the lowest prices but to capitalize on the benefits of our growers - they are not just organic, but also socially and environmentally responsible.\\"  Campaigns and innovations  Eosta launched several innovations and campaigns in the field of sustainable food and packaging over the years. In 2018, Eosta won a European Business Award for the Environment for its True Cost of Food campaign, an awareness campaign about True Cost Accounting in food and agriculture . Another campaign in 2016 under the name \\"Natural Branding\\" introduced laser marking, whereby laser tattoos are applied to pieces of fruit and vegetables in order to reduce the use of plastic stickers and packaging materials. The Guardian reported on it .  True Cost Accounting  In 2017 Eosta released a True Cost Accounting report on its impacts. The report, named \\"True Cost Accounting in Food, Farming and Finance\\" was presented to Prince Charles . Eosta‚Äôs pilot calculated the impact costs of soil erosion and water pollution for several products, including organic apples from Argentina and organic oranges from South Africa. These numbers were compared with non-organic products. The report also included an integrated profit and loss statement for Eosta; one of the first to be published for a SME company worldwide . Eosta's CEO Volkert Engelsman said in Der Spiegel: \\"Apples in the supermarket for 99 cents per kilogram are not really a bargain, when the true costs for growing these apples are eventually put on the shoulders of the government and the tax payer.\\" Experts at FAO estimate the hidden environmental costs of worldwide food production at 1900 billion Euro per year. .  Controversy  In 2016 Eosta's CEO, Volkert Engelsman, accused Dutch supermarkets, specifically Albert Heijn, of \\"criminal behaviour\\" in the Dutch financial daily paper Het Financieele Dagblad . Engelsman said: \\"Many supermarkets do not pay a realistic price to growers. By doing so, they avert health costs and environmental costs and put them on the shoulders of society. Academics call this a systemic failure, I call it criminal.\\" Albert Heijn commented that it did not recognize itself in the description and would set up a meeting with Engelsman.

Plot The story revolves around a Baba (preacher) known as 'Baba Nirala.' Whose followers have blind faith in him and will do anything that he asks of them. But it is for sure that this Baba Nirala is a conman, who makes sure that his devotees leave behind all kinds of 'moh-maya' and stay attached to the Aashram for life. Meanwhile, Darshan Kumaar, the actor seen in Mary Kom (film) and NH10 (film) before, is a cop in this series. Furthermore, he is adamant about unraveling the truth behind the skeletons and dead bodies recovered from the Asharam's property. It seems to be a murder mystery. Every episode unfolds a mystery that revolves around the Baba Nirala. Whether the cop will find evidence and prove anything is left for the Part II of 'Aashram' season 1, which they announced very subtly as the show ends.

He is said to become a weizza and worship along with Bo Bo Aung.  Life  Setkya Prince was born on 27 October 1812 in Mingun, near Ava, to the Crown Prince of Sagaing, who later became King Bagyidaw, and Hsinbyume. His given name was Maung Pe Khin. His birth was surrounded by miraculous events and his body bore the signs of a future world emperor. King Bodawpaya, his great grandfather, conferred the title of Thatoe Minhla Shwetaung on him, and gave him the status of Prince of Nyaungyan. His mother Hsinbyume died seven days after his birth. He is said to have been very popular with the people. After Burma's defeat in the First Anglo-Burmese War, it was hoped that he would succeed his father to the throne, drive out the British, and usher in an era of prosperity for Burma and Buddhism. Setkya Prince married to Shwetantin Princess, and gave birth to a daughter called Me Tin Gyi. Shwetantin Princess was a daughter of Prince of Hlaing, a son of King Bodawpaya, and Princess of Danubyu, a daughter of King Bodawpaya. Therefore, Setkya Prince and Shwetantin Princess were half-siblings. When Bagyidaw was overthrown by his brother King Tharrawaddy, Setkya Prince was executed on 4 April 1838, using the velvet sack into the river method so favored by Burmese royalty. Weizza-hood Setkya Mintha is listed in notable wezizzas As a result of palace intrigues, he was eventually executed by drowning. However, many believed Setkya Mintha had not been drowned, and had been saved miraculously by the powerful weizza, Bo Bo Aung, who brought him to a hidden weizza abode where he learned esoteric practices from the weizza and eventually attained weizza-hood. Using his weizza powers, Bo Bo Aung spirited Setkya Mintha to the heaven where the future kings are said to bide their time before coming down to earth. Anti-colonial movement Setkya Mintha is associated with the anti-colonial movement in Burma. Throughout most of the colonial era, the figure of Setkya Mintha mainly represented anti-colonial resistance, and a series of rebellions were led by people claiming to be this mysterious personage. After the British had annexed the whole of Burma and deposed the last Burmese king in 1885, these rebellions largely sought to restore the monarchy and the king in his role as the foremost promoter and supporter of the Buddha's Sasana.

History The outbreak of the revolutionary strike was the result of the economic situation in the area and the country, and the expectations of radical social change that had created many sectors of workers since the early days of the republican era. In Catalonia, the most radical sectors of the anarchists controlled the CNT, which coincided with an increase in social conflict between workers and the republican state. Preceded by the Castilblanco events and the Arnedo events, the revolt began on January 19, 1932, when the miners of the San Cornelio colony, in F√≠gols, started a strike and seized weapons from the somat√©n (Catalan parapolice) and began patrolling the streets. Some workers even proclaimed \\"libertarian communism.\\" The reason for the revolt was the harsh working conditions in the mines, with long hours and lack of security at the bottom of the shafts, and also the expectations raised by the new rights of assembly and association that the newly approved Spanish Constitution of 1931 recognized. The following day the conflict had spread to other towns in Alt Llobregat such as Berga, Sallent, Cardona, Balsareny, Navarcl√©s and S√∫ria, where they stopped the mines and closed the shops. In Manresa workers' pickets prevented access to factories and workshops. Telephone lines were cut. In many places the republican flags were replaced by the red and black flags of the CNT. That same day a delegate from the CNT Regional Committee proclaimed in F√≠gols, in front of the revolutionary committee created by the miners, that \\"libertarian communism had arrived\\", news that spread throughout the area. The following day, January 21, Manuel Aza√±a declared before the Cortes: \\"I am not scared that there are strikes ... because it is a right recognized by law\\", but no one could take \\"an attitude of rebellion against the Republic\\" and that the military had the obligation to intervene against these \\"excesses\\". The government of the Republic ordered an armed intervention and thus, on January 22, the first military units arrived in Manresa and by the next day they had already occupied all the towns in the area except F√≠gols. The miners had blown up a powder magazine and fled through the mountains. Republican rule was restored and the miners were fired. Buenaventura Durruti. On January 23, when only F√≠gols remained under insurgent control, the National Committee of the CNT agreed to \\"give the order to stop all of Spain, accepting it with all its consequences.\\" However, only a few isolated towns in Valencia and Aragon followed in the footsteps of Alt Llobregat. In Alcorisa the insurgents planted two bombs in the Civil Guard barracks, and in Castel de Cabra, the rioters seized \\"the City Hall, destroyed the tax register and all the documents that were in the archives of the municipal secretary.‚Äù Infantry troops were sent from Barcelona under the command of Domingo Batet to put an end to the riots. On January 24, F√≠gols was recaptured by the state, and by January 27, the first anarchist insurrection against the Republic came to an end. There were many detainees and all CNT centers in the affected regions were closed, but the repressive measure that had the greatest impact was the government's decision to apply the Defense of the Republic Law to a hundred detainees, who were deported to the African colonies (Morocco, Western Sahara and Guinea). On January 22, when the troops occupied Manresa, in Barcelona several anarchist militants were arrested, among whom were the brothers Francisco Ascaso and Domingo Ascaso, Buenaventura Durruti and Tom√°s Cano Ruiz. They were transferred to the steamship \\"Buenos Aires\\", anchored in the port. Four days later there were already more than 200 detainees on the ship. On January 28, a hundred of the deportees started a hunger strike in protest and wrote a manifesto denouncing their defenselessness. Some managed to leave, but on February 10 the \\"Buenos Aires\\" set sail from the port of Barcelona with 104 detainees on board. After picking up other detainees in C√°diz, the ship passed through the Canary Islands and finally docked at Villa Cisneros on April 3. On the way, some of the prisoners had fallen ill, one of them died, and others were released. The last deportees returned to the Peninsula in September. With this mass deportation, the confrontations between the CNT and the republican-socialist government became even more intense. The uprising was also a trigger for a further split within the CNT between the libertarian possibilist tendency and the anarchist, as the strategic differences of each sector began to clash. After publishing a manifesto, √Ångel Pesta√±a and other possibilists were expelled from the CNT and formed the Syndicalist Party, with the intention of participating in state politics.Tom√°s √Ålvarez: √Ångel Pesta√±a: El anarquista de la triste figura.

A. Kannan and written by Thanjaivannan. Based on the life of the Maratha warrior Shivaji, it stars Sivaji Ganesan in the title role. The film premiered on Doordarshan on 21 July 1974.  Production  July 1974 was when the tri- centenary of the Maratha warrior Shivaji's ascent to the throne was celebrated. To commemorate this, the Bombay branch of Doordarshan wanted to make a television film later titled Chatrapati Sivaji. T. S. Narayana Swamy, a Doordarshan producer, approached Sivaji Ganesan, who had previously portrayed Shivaji in the play Sivaji Kanda Hindu Rajyam and the film Bhakta Tukaram (1973). Ganesan accepted to play Shivaji, and even offered to finance the whole project. A. V. Meiyappan of AVM Productions lent his studio along with the necessary props for shooting. Thanjaivannan wrote the screenplay based on Ganesan's story. Ganesan's colleague S. A. Kannan was the director, and various technicians from Sivaji Films worked on the project.  Broadcast  Chatrapati Sivaji premiered on Doordarshan on 21 July 1974, before airing on other television channels. Balwant Moreshwar Purandare gave an introductory in Marathi, after which the film was telecast in Tamil. In 1975, it became the first programme to be telecast on the Madras branch of Doordarshan.

The first church, named Father Milan‚Äôs Church, was built there in 1882 but later destroyed.

Renovations since yielded lodgings, offices, and bathrooms, but all have largely preserved the original structure, including its rectangular nave and dual bell tower oriented west- to-east. A simple, unadorned arch entryway leads through the narthex and nave to the chapel and in turn to the sacristy. The sparse interior rests on a rectangular, almost symmetrical foundation. Administrative offices are hosted in an adjoining building on the south side. The altar lies on a square platform next to the nave and dominates the interior. The eastward bell towers by the entrance have simple square capstones. In the early 1990s, extensive interior renovations introduced the latest marble and ceramic materials, but the exterior remains humbly decorated, including the four windows each on the northern and southern fa√ßades.

The local had previously voted for an indefinite strike. The strike is part of a dispute dating back to 2018, when the union and management were unable to negotiate a new contract. The strike was primarily about shift work and work-life balance for the longshore and maintenance workers who are required to work 19 days in a row before having two off. Background The Port of Montreal is Canada's second busiest port of entry with approximately $100 billion worth of goods passing through the port each year. Approximately 1,125 workers are part of CUPE local 375. Working without a contract, CUPE members participated in a series of daytime walkouts during the summer of 2020. On July 27, CUPE launched a four-day protest strike. In response, management rerouted ships to other ports. In response to this action, CUPE members voted in favor of an indefinite strike. On August 4, 99.22% of eligible workers voted in favour of a strike. Strike Shortly after the strike began, the governments of Fran√ßois Legault (Quebec premier) and Doug Ford (Ontario premier), asked for the federal government to intervene to force the strikers back to work. This request was denied, with Labour Minister Filomena Tassi writing that \\"Our government has faith in the collective bargaining process, as we know the best deals are made at the table.\\" The Mining Association of Canada called the decision not to intervene \\"incomprehensible.\\" Tensions were heightened during the finals days of the strike after the Maritime Employers Association announced its intention to hire scabs to unload the sitting containers. However, A truce was agreed upon on August 21 which allowed the port to reopen two days later. The two sides agreed to resume contract talks and the union pledged to continue working without a labour stoppage for the next seven months after which time the union would resume its right to strike.

Soldiers on pick-up trucks stormed the Soundiata military base in the town of Kati, where gunfire was exchanged before weapons were distributed from the armory and senior officers arrested. Tanks and armoured vehicles were seen on the town's streets, as well as military trucks heading for the capital, Bamako. The soldiers detained several government officials including the President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke√Øta who resigned and dissolved the government. This is the country's second coup in less than 10 years, following the 2012 coup d'√©tat. Background Protests in Mali had been ongoing since 5 June, with protesters calling for the resignation of President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke√Øta. Protesters were displeased with the management of the ongoing insurgency, alleged government corruption, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and a floundering economy. Eleven deaths and 124 injuries were reported during the protests. Coup d'√©tat On the morning of 18 August 2020, soldiers began firing bullets into the air at a military base in Kati, a town away from Bamako, the capital of Mali. After moving into the capital, the mutineers arrested Minister of Finance Abdoulaye Daffe, the Chief of Staff of the National Guard , and Moussa Timbin√©, speaker of the National Assembly. The Prime Minister, Boubou Ciss√©, appealed for dialogue with the mutineers, acknowledging they held \\"legitimate frustrations\\". A mutiny leader later claimed that Ke√Øta and Ciss√© had been arrested at the former's residence in Bamako; African Union Commission chairman Moussa Faki confirmed that Ke√Øta, Ciss√©, and other officials had been arrested and called for their release. A spokesman for the M5-RFP opposition coalition welcomed their detention, describing it as a \\"popular insurrection\\". The officials were taken to the military camp in Kati where the uprising began. As news of the mutiny spread, hundreds of protesters gathered at Bamako's Independence Monument to demand Ke√Øta's resignation. Protesters also set a building belonging to the Ministry of Justice ablaze. It is not clear how many soldiers took part in the coup, who initiated it or who will now take charge. Aftermath Assimi Go√Øta, surrounded by members of the , 19 August 2020 President Ke√Øta resigned around midnight, while also dissolving the government and parliament. \\"I want no blood to be spilled to keep me in power,\\" he added. Five colonels appeared in the TV broadcast to the nation, led by Colonel Assimi Go√Øta. They called themselves the National Committee for the Salvation of the People. The bodies of four people killed by gunfire and about 15 wounded, all likely hit by stray bullets, were brought into one of the city's main hospitals, said Elhadj Djim√© Kant√©, a spokesman for the hospital union. The coup leaders denied that anyone had been killed, but soldiers were constantly firing in the air, cheered on by crowds of young people. Military leaders had ordered closure of all border crossings and imposed a night-time curfew. \\"As of today, 19 August 2020, all air and land borders are closed until further notice. A curfew is in place from 21:00 to 05:00 until further notice,\\" Col-Major Isma√´l Wagu√©, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Malian Air Force, said in a televised address. He also invited opposition groups to talks for fresh elections. Opposition member Mahmoud Dicko announced that he is leaving politics as a result of a meeting between him and some of the soldiers that took part in the mutiny. Coup leaders promised new elections within a \\"reasonable timeline,\\" without specifying what that meant. Ke√Øta left the country in September for medical treatment in the United Arab Emirates. Ke√Øta, 75 years old, was originally hospitalised in the capital a few days before leaving. Isma√´l Wagu√© (left) and Malick Diaw, 7 September 2020 Experts chosen by Mali's new military chieftains have proposed a two-year interim government led by a president chosen by them, despite calls by Mali's neighbors for elections within a year. They suggest that the soldiers behind the coup nominate the interim president and vice president and propose the interim president choose the prime minister. Under the draft, the president would be from the civil or military sectors. The nominee must be between the ages of 35 and 75 and would not be allowed to run for election at the end of the transition. Right after the coup, military leaders promised to reinstate a civilian government and hold elections within a relatively short timeframe. On 12 September 2020, the agreed to an 18-month political transition to civilian rule. On 21 September 2020 Bah Ndaw was named interim president by a group of 17 electors, with Go√Øta being appointed vice president. The government is supposed to preside over an interim period of 18 months. A spokesperson for political-religious leader Mahmoud Dicko praised his nomination as president. Leaders of the M5-RFP, active since the 2020 Malian protests, also signalled support. On 25 September the government was inaugurated. International reaction Representatives of several countries condemned the coup, as did representatives of the African Union, European Union, and United Nations. The President of France, a country which has been involved in fighting an Islamist insurgency in its former colony since 2013, called for power to be returned to civilians and for arrested leaders to be freed. The United States cut off military aid to Mali on 21 August. The United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a resolution condemning the coup and calling on the soldiers to return to their barracks and release all detainees without delay. Amnesty International also called for the release of the detainees. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) imposed sanctions on Mali and called on neighbouring states to close their land and air borders. On 25 August, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie suspended Mali from membership and called for the immediate release of Ke√Øta. On 7 September at a summit in Niamey, Niger, regional bloc ECOWAS gave the Malian military rulers a deadline of 15 September to appoint a new civilian President and Prime Minister.

The expedition from the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw was directed by Piotr Bieli≈Ñski. Earlier in the framework of the same project, Polish archaeologists conducted research at the sites of Tell Djassa and Tell Abu Hafur. The tell measures 140 by 120 meters and is 8 meters high. Nine settlement layers were identified during the excavations. The oldest remains date to the Halaf period; the settlement expanded in the Early Dynastic III period (mid-3rd millennium BC); the youngest phases date to the Neo-Assyrian period. The settlement was encircled by a 4-meter-thick wall built of mud- brick, with thick (more than 6 meters) buttresses faced with basalt blocks. This type of fortification is called glacis. Thirty-four graves of children and adults, as well as infants, were uncovered. They included pit graves, graves in stone setting, and infant burials in kitchen vessels. The child burials yielded the richest and most diverse grave furnishings, consisting of vessels as well as jewelry made of bronze, stone, shells, and other materials. The finds included zoomorphic beads and pendants.  References  * Dariusz SzelƒÖg (2014). Amulets? On the possible function of zoomorphic pendants from child burials in Tell Rad Shaqrah (Syria).

The Minimalist work comprises five different polyhedral elements painted black. The five elements of the sculpture have different size and shapes, based on tetrahedrons and octahedrons, with faceted surfaces painted with a semi-gloss black, and are individually named \\"Crocus\\", \\"Dud\\", \\"Shaft\\", \\"Slide\\", and \\"Smomhawk\\".

The elements have no fixed positions, and their relative positions and orientations may vary according to the requirements of the specific location, so each installation is different.

The sculpture may allude to the structure of molecules and crystals, or the Japanese rock garden of Ry≈çan-ji in Kyoto. As Smith described it: \\"The Rocks were really conceived as one piece, although I didn't think of them as having a fixed spatial relationship to one another.

Formed in 2001 by friends Miguel, Gesta, Faucom and Dedeco, they initially began the project just to \\"amuse themselves\\"; their name, \\"Dibob\\", is a contraction of the Portuguese-language expression \\"de bobeira\\", meaning \\"goofing off\\". Their debut EP Markebra was self-released in 2003, after which the critically acclaimed full-length albums O Fant√°stico Mundo Dibob (2004) and A √ìpera do Cafajeste (2007) followed. For the release of the latter, a huge show at the now-defunct music venue Canec√£o was organized. In the 2005 edition of the MTV Video Music Brazil award, they performed a cover of Ultraje a Rigor's \\"N√≥s Vamos Invadir Sua Praia\\" alongside Leela, Ramirez and Forfun, with whom they would develop a strong friendship. In 2012 they collaborated on the song \\"Rio Porque T√¥ no Rio\\", described as an ode to Rio de Janeiro. In 2009, vocalist Dedeco left the band, and bassist Gesta took over the lead vocals; as a trio they would release the cover album Resgate in 2010. Dedeco returned the following year, but they announced they would be ceasing their activities soon after. Following a 4-year hiatus, they confirmed they would return to perform; in 2020 they played at the Rio Rock Tour festival alongside Strike, Catch Side and Darvin.

Biography She was born in the M√©nilmontant district of Paris. After leaving school she worked in a nightclub near the Champs-√âlys√©es, where she met composer and arranger Paul Mauriat, who encouraged her singing career and helped her win a contract with the Rivi√®ra label. Her first EP in 1965 included \\"Vous pouvez me dire\\" (a version of \\"He Don‚Äôt Want Your Love Anymore\\", first recorded by Lulu) and \\"Une rose\\", a version of \\"Love Me Tender\\". She had some success in the French pop charts over the next few years with songs including her version of \\"Baby Love\\", the girl group influenced \\"J‚Äôai rat√© mon bac\\", the more downbeat \\"Ticket de quai\\", and \\"Je chante et je danse\\" which featured a jazzy Hammond organ arrangement. In 1966 she moved to the Philips label, and had hits in France with \\"Mes amis, mes copains\\", \\"C‚Äôest la mode\\", \\"Le mannequin\\", and \\"Tu peux partir o√π tu voudras\\", a version of John Phillips' song \\"Go Where You Wanna Go\\". She also started writing her own material, including \\"Lettre pour Annie\\". Her last chart hit came in 1967 with \\"Les enfants de Finlande\\".Richie Unterberger, Biography, Allmusic.com. Retrieved 18 August 2020 Annie Philippe, Ready Steady Girls. Retrieved 18 August 2020 Her style was often compared to France Gall. Writer Richie Unterberger says that her records had \\"that same consciously over-cute girlish delivery, bouncy tunes, and (perhaps inadvertently) eclectic production, in which Spectorian arrangements, American girl-group influences, smooth mainstream French pop orchestrations, melancholy ballads, groovy jazzy organs, bad Dixielandesque show tunes, and more all swam in the same stream... [but] her material was not quite as interesting..\\". In 1968, she teamed up with singer Claude Fran√ßois for a series of duets, and she toured with Jacques Dutronc before taking a break from the music in 1969. She attempted a comeback in the late 1970s with a Dolly Parton song. Starting in 2001, she toured with Frank Alamo. She later performed as part of the touring show √Çge tendre, la tourn√©e des idoles, featuring performers from the 1960s and 1970s. A compilation of her recordings, L'Integrale Sixties, was issued on CD in 1999.

Archaeological research  Exploration of the site began in 1984 as part of the Eski Mosul Dam Salvage Project, an international archaeological salvage operation organized by the Iraqi Directorate of Antiquities due to the building of a dam on the Tigris River. Excavations on Tell Raffaan and in its vicinity were conducted by an expedition from the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw. Piotr Bieli≈Ñski directed the archaeological works, while Ryszard F. Mazurowski and Waldemar Chmielewski headed the field survey team, which identified Paleolithic sites on the hills surrounding the micro-region. The Polish expedition also carried out work at the site of Tell Rijim, located in the same micro-region. At its highest point, Tell Raffaan rose 6.5 meters above the level of the Tigris. The research was conducted only in the eastern part of the tell since a modern cemetery occupied the western one. Only one archaeological layer was identified, dating to the Early Uruk period (second half of the 4th millennium BC). The excavations yielded numerous fragments of pottery as well as obsidian and flint tools. On the slope, there was a skeletal grave in stone setting, furnished with three undecorated cups similar to the pottery found in other parts of the site. This part of the tell was badly eroded; no architectural remains were uncovered.

It is considered the first individual house built in the international style in Ireland.  History  Balnagowan House was built under the name Wendon in the late 1920s by the Dublin developer George Linzell. Linzell commissioned the London architect, Harold Greenwood, to design the house. The house has a flat roof on a v-shaped plan, consisting of two wings set at a 90 degree angle to each other coming off a central section. It featured large steel frame windows and a loggia on the second floor which was accessible from two bedrooms. It was built with pre-cast concrete blocks, fitted with central heating, an internal telephone system, and a serving hatch from the kitchen to the dining room with electric hotplates amongst many other modern conveniences. The interior had oak panelling and chrome light switches, in keeping with the modernist style. A swimming pool and tennis courts were later added the grounds. After its completion the magazine Irish Builder described the house as \\"Dublin's Wonder House\\" in 1932. It is regarded as the first individual house in Ireland to have been built in a modernist or international style of architecture. Linzell, the son-in-law of Alexander Strain, built this family home within the larger development of houses he was building along Mobhi Road and off the Ballymun Road. Linzell sold the house in 1938, when he moved to Ballsbridge where he was building more houses. The house's second owner was the publican John Doyle, the proprietor of Doyle's Corner in Phibsborough. Doyle renamed the house Balnagowan (sometimes spelt Bealnagown) after his former home in Rathmines. The Petty family lived in the house from 1953 to 1956, and lastly the Quinn family lived there until 1971 when they sold the house to the semi- state organisation, the Central Fisheries Board. The house functioned as an office building for the Board until it was sold in 2005. Since 2005, it has been vacant and falling into disrepair. Since 2011, the house has been listed on Dublin city‚Äôs Record of Protected Structures. In 2017 a fire broke out in the outbuildings, but did not reach the main house. It has been recorded that much of the house's original interiors are intact, with the Fisheries Board leaving many of the features and boarding in others. The structure is declining, with damage recorded over time to the fabric of the building. It has also been the site of anti-social behaviour and has been squatted in.

History View of the access catwalk to Km 21 Bus Terminal. With the expansion of S√£o Paulo, the supply of inhabitants became a vital issue. Until then, the city had the Vila Mariana Slaughterhouse to supply the city with fresh meat. This structure became outdated in the beginning of the 1910s and obligated the government to authorize interested businessmen to build new slaughterhouses. One of these was planned by Colonel Delfino Cerqueiro. Authorized by Municipal Resolution no. 50 of 20 August 1914, Colonel Cerqueira implanted in 1920 a slaughterhouse, located by Kilometer 21 of the main line of Estrada de Ferro Sorocabana. With the construction of the slaughterhouse, Sorocabana built a train yard to receive cargo wagons that transported oxes to the slaughter. Besides Cerqueira's interests in having a station beside the Kilometer 21 Slaughterhouse, his application was archived by the municipality in 1924. The slaughterhouse was instituted in 1938 and operated until mid-1960s, when it was deactivated. In 1951, Quil√¥metro 21 stop was built, in front of the old slaughterhouse, which became the popular name of the small station. With the deactivation and abandonment of the slaughterhouse in the 1960s, its facilities were invaded and transformed into slums that evolved into a huge favela beside the station. In mid-1960s, Sorocabana renamed the station to Matadouro, creating protests of the residents of the housings built by Cohab- SP nearby the station in 1972. In 1996, the station (and West and South Lines) were transferred from FEPASA to CPTM. While the south access of the station, built over the tracks, became as the main access, the north access was built and underused, due to giving access to an empty area of and was closed to avoid income evasion. In 2002, Rodoanel Mario Covas was built over the station and the favela was entirely removed. Later, in 2007, the Prefecture of Osas hired the architecture office Vigliecca e Associados to project a housing in the area of next to the north access of the station. With a capacity for 1592 housing units, the works for Miguel Costa housing, named after the nearby station, delayed to begin. Besides that, the capacity was reduced to 960 housing units. The first ones were scheduled to be delivered in 2018, despite the lack of road access (due to the area be surrounded by areas belonging to the Army) delayed the deliver to mid-2019. Projected since 1978, Km 21 Bus Terminal was built only in 2017, receiving in majority municipal bus lines of Carapicu√≠ba, besides it was a bus terminal and stop for municipal lines of Osasco and EMTU metropolitan lines. Despite the construction of these developments, General Miguel Costa station didn't received modernization works of its outdated structure until this day, what complicates its use and connection to the bus terminal by commuters. Toponymy Miguel Costa, no date. Opened in 1951, the station initially received the name of the nearest milestone, Km 21. In mid-1960s, Estrada de Ferro Sorocabana changes its name to Matadoura, due to a facility located next to the station. The deactivation of the slaughterhouse and the negative connotation of its name obligated FEPASA to rename the station back to its old name only in 1979. A campaign leaded by professor Mioguel Costa J√∫nior to rename the station after his father, Miguel Costa, was succeeded and resulted in the renaming of the station from Km 21 to General Miguel Costa in December 1987 through State Law Project no. 5832 of 20 October 1987. Miguel Costa (1885-1959) was an official of S√£o Paulo Public Force, one of the main participants of the 1924 tenentism uprising, of Coluna Prestes (which he leaded along with Lu√≠s Carlos Prestes, the 1930 Revolution and the 1932 Constitutionalist Revolution. According to his son, Miguel Costa was a frequent visitor of the region and, due to his rank, used to stop the train circulation in the area, so he and his accompaniment could fish in a nearby lake. Later, Miguel Costa's family radicated themselves in Carapicu√≠ba.

Archaeological research  The site was explored in 1984‚Äì1985 as part of the Eski Mosul Dam Salvage Project (later renamed Saddam Dam Salvage Project), an international archaeological salvage operation organized by the Iraqi Directorate of Antiquities in the 1980s due to the building of a dam on the Tigris River. Excavations on Tell Rijim were conducted by an expedition from the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw, directed by Piotr Bieli≈Ñski, during three field seasons. The site is a relatively small tell (130 meters in diameter), with archaeological layers dating to many different periods. Six skeletal graves, presumably from the Sassanid period (3rd‚Äì6th century AD), were discovered on the top of the hill. Neo-Assyrian remains were uncovered just below the surface. They consisted of buildings with stone foundations, rectangular rooms, and paved courtyards; the houses were furnished with bread ovens. Four cylinder seals dated to the second half of the 8th century BC are an important find from this layer. The best-preserved are the remains of a settlement of the Khabur Ware Culture from the first half of the 2nd millennium BC, which was surrounded by a defense wall. A large part of a residential building was uncovered in the western area of the site and Ninevite 5 graves in the central one. The oldest layers date to the Uruk period. The erosion of the tell, which occurred during the breaks in the settlement, hindered the excavations. The Polish expedition also carried out work at the site of Tell Raffaan, located in the same micro- region.

Founded by Jack Cross, its is most famous for its rebuilding work on de Havilland DH.88 Comet racer G-ACSS and Percival Mew Gull G-AEXF. History=Foundation Reginald Cross, known universally as Jack Cross, had worked in a technical capacity for Brazil Straker, Douglas Motors, Bristol Aeroplane, Imperial Airways and Hillman Airways. In 1934 he and Edward Hillman set up Hillman & Cross at Goodmayes, Essex. On Hillman's death shortly afterwards, Cross took over fully. In 1936 he moved the company to Gravesend, under the name of Essex Aero.Ord-Hume (2007) His company occupied the premises recently vacated by Percival Aircraft.Turner (2000)London (2018) De Havilland Comet G-ACSS The company quickly rose to fame when Arthur Clouston and F. E. Tasker commissioned Essex to rebuild de Havilland DH.88 Comet G-ACSS, winner of the 1934 MacRobertson England-Australia Air Race under the name of Grosvenor House, which they had purchased from a scrap dealer. Variously named \\"The Orphan\\", \\"The Burberry\\" and \\"Australian Anniversary\\", the Comet went on to make several more record flights.Ogilvy, David; DH88: de Havilland's Racing Comets, 2nd Edn, Airlife, 1988. On one occasion, Alex Henshaw (see below) flew Cross and Lionel \\"Jack\\" London out to Cypress to conduct running repairs. London was co-founder of the new company and Cross' principal technical assistant. They were sometimes referred to as \\"the two Jacks\\". Percival Mew Gull G-AEXF When Alex Henshaw procured Percival Mew Gull G-AEXF, the success of Essex Aero with the Comet led him to choose them to undertake a major redesign of his own sleek little racer. They undertook major airframe and systems modifications, including slimmed-down fuselage and wheel spats, even replacing the pilot's seat with a sheet of foam rubber laid on the cockpit floor. They installed one of the de Havilland Gipsy Six R engines scrapped from G-ACSS (which they had re-engined), with a purpose-designed crankshaft extension to adapt it for a de Havilland two-position variable- pitch propeller in place of the French Ratier used by the Comet, since foreign components were not allowed under King's Cup Air Race regulations. Cross also designed special pistons, redesigned the air intake and made other modifications. Henshaw won the 1938 King's Cup at a record speed which remains unbeaten in its class to this day.Henshaw (1980) Essex Aero then modified it further with a more reliable Gipsy Six II engine (which they had also fitted to G-ACSS) and improved instrumentation and fuel tankage. Henshaw again set a record, this time for the return flight to Cape Town, South Africa. The aircraft has since been rebuilt more than once and today it flies with the Shuttleworth Collection at Old Warden. Magnesium fabrication Essex Aero specialised in manufacturing components from magnesium alloys. From the outbreak of World War II they not only serviced the Blenheims, Spitfires, and Hurricanes stationed at Gravesend but also expanded their manufacturing. They claimed to have manufactured 5,250 magnesium-alloy fuel tanks for the Supermarine Spitfire and Seafire.Essex Aero advertisement, Flight, 29 August 1946. Essex Aero also played a leading role in the development of the lightweight \\"slipper\\" drop tanks introduced on the Spitfire and Seafire to extend their range, initially in the defence of Malta. It has been suggested that they proposed a magnesium alloy twin-engined fighter, but that the Ministry of Aircraft Production was not interested. The Sprite light aircraft In 1947 Essex Aero began construction of a prototype Sprite, a small, low-cost light aircraft entirely from magnesium alloys, and to be produced in quantity using mass-production techniques. It was to be a single- engined side-by-side two-seater of modern appearance, with a tricycle undercarriage and a vee tail. Options for fixed or retractable landing gear were planned. Its nose was designed for direct mounting of the proposed Nuffield 100 hp 4HO aero engine without any additional bearer structure. However no other market for the Nuffield could be found and when it was shelved, so too was the half-finished Sprite. =Specifications (retractable- gear version)The Allard sports car In 1952 Essex Aero designed, built and installed a magnesium alloy sports coup√© body for a 1951 Allard J2X chassis, lengthening it to fit the sleek custom body, which weighed in at little more than . Cross drove the car regularly. As of 2016 the car was undergoing restoration by Heritage Classics in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire.\\"Heritage Classics Workshop Visit\\", Porsche Club of Great Britain, March 2016. (Retrieved 18 August 2020). Closure Unable to expand their factory locally due to is closeness to the aerodrome, Essex Aero established several other manufacturing sites during the war. Afterwards the aerodrome fell into disuse but planning difficulties delayed continuing plans for consolidation. In 1956 the company's debts mounted and Essex Aero went into receivership.

A spokesperson for the State Border Committee claimed that Kalesnikava was trying to cross into Ukraine at 4am with the help of two of her associates, Anton Rodnenkov and Ivan Kravtsov.

It was released by Heard's label Alleviated Records in 1985. The track was developed in 1984 after Heard felt his creative input was not being incorporated into the rock music cover bands he had been drumming in. This led to Heard buying a Roland Jupiter-6 and developing two tracks in one night: \\"Washing Machine\\" and \\"Mystery of Love\\" which he recorded to via tape cassettes. Cassette tapes of these tracks were given to musicians local Chicago DJs and became popular at dance clubs in Chicago. The track was re- recorded by Heard in a studio with his friend Robert Owens adding vocals to the track and was credited to Fingers Inc.. This version was released in 1986 on DJ International Records and became a top ten hit on the Hot Dance/Disco 12 Inch Singles charts in 1986. In the United Kingdom, initial reception to the Fingers Inc. was not enthusiastic, until the song was included on the compilation The House Sound of Chicago which increased its popularity dramatically in the United Kingdom. Production=Background When Larry Heard was growing up he had a piano in his house and as a child would try to emulate television show theme songs. Heard would later learn to play guitar and quickly moved on to the bass, and then to drums, where he felt most comfortable. Heard initially was interesting in pursuing a career as either a teacher, a lawyer, or an architect but moved on to playing drums in local groups. Later Heard became interested in started to put some distance in between him and some of the groups, stating that the last group he found himself \\"having to buy [his] own synthesizer, and then buy a drum machine to keep the time since I wasn‚Äôt gonna be able to hold the sticks and do the keyboard part.\\" Heard's first synthesizer purchased was a Roland Jupiter-6. Production \\"Mystery of Love\\" was created on a Roland Jupiter-6 synthesizer On the first night of purchasing the synthesizer in 1984, Heard created \\"Mystery of Love\\" and \\"Washing Machine\\" which he described as \\"my first drafts ever. I was lucky enough to catch it on a cassette tape, which has been lost since then, of course.\\" Heard described the influence to make these tracks, as he \\"always had ideas when I was behind the drums, but the other band members weren‚Äôt really receptive, again, to the drummer having ideas, and I think there‚Äôs pretty much rich history of drummers, like Phil Collins, and Narada Michael Walden, and people like that, that step out. But you have to express your ideas, or it‚Äôs not fulfilling.\\" The tracks were recorded to two cassette decks with one pass on one cassette, and then, once Heard decided what he wanted over the top, he ran the next pass, and played the parts live. Heard reflected on these recordings in 2016, describing both \\"Mystery of Love\\" and \\"Washing Machine\\" as a \\"happy accident, a product of youthful excitement\\" due to his excitement to work on new equipment and the lessons learned from listening to his parents play the piano. There are multiple iterations of \\"Mystery Of Love.\\" The first was an original version, which Heard described as his \\"personal prototype\\" which he made three acetate copies of, one copy owned by Heard, and others given to Chicago DJs Frankie Knuckles, Ron Hardy. According to Heard, these acetates have changed hands several times. The 1985 version of the track is at a slow tempo, at about 110 beats per minute. A second version was credited to Fingers Inc. and made for the label DJ International Records. This version was re-recorded in a studio with vocals by Heard's friend Robert Owens. This version is credited to Fingers Inc.. Heard felt that \\" the first one is just special for me, it just holds the essence of what I was doing, what just naturally flowed out of me. The next ones ended up being more rehearsed, so I don‚Äôt really feel the same intensity in those versions, but that‚Äôs showbiz, I guess.\\" Release Heard sent out the tape to some music labels with no response and was suggested by a friend to release the record on his own. The original releases of Heard's first track did not have a label attached to them, with Heard recalling that he \\"didn‚Äôt know how you go about establishing a name, and that kind of a thing. But I did start my publishing off, so I ended up deciding to use the publishing name as the label name since I got clearance for the name.\\" Heard has declared the first version as being attached to his own label Alleviated Records, despite any credit on the label. The track was officially released in 1985. Heard would then soon hear the track on the radio, and recalled hearing \\"Mystery of Love\\" on the radio while driving on Lakeshore Drive and he nearly drove himself off the road he was so excited. The Mr.Fingers version on \\"Mystery of Love\\" released by D.J. International entered the Billboards Hot Dance/Disco 12 Inch Singles sales charts on April 19, 1986 and peaked at number 10 on the charts. Reception Heard stated that the reception of \\"Mystery of Love\\" was so great that Ron Hardy and Frankie Knuckles were claiming that they had made the song. Heard joked that he had \\"kind of foil everything for both of them, when people who knew me saying this was the guy who made the \\"Mystery of Love\\" track. So, that kind of put a little tension in the relationship between myself and Frankie and Ron Hardy. Not from my perspective, but I think they maybe always felt like I would harbour some resentment for that, but to me it was more of a compliment. I mean, who would claim something that they feel is crap?

He became a columnist for The Morning Post,\\"Studies in Style\\", The Morning Post (19 October 1900), p. 3. and speaking at the 1887 annual dinner of the London Association of Correctors of the Press, \\"said that as a reviewer he was not ashamed to stand up and say he belonged to that much-abused fraternity\\", speculating that even the ghosts of dead writers would complain of their depictions by modern reviewers.\\"The Correctors of the Press\\", The Morning Post (8 March 1897), p. 3.  Primary publishing career  In 1900, Helm published a series of \\"Studies in Style\\" examining the writing styles of various authors, and was described in The Morning Post as having \\"hit on the happy idea of reproducing them with just sufficient caricature to make apparent to the simplest intelligence the affectation, or the vulgarity, or the idiosyncracy of the particular writer\\".\\"Studies in Style\\", The Morning Post (27 November 1900), p. 2. The review found the work to be \\"ample evidence of Mr. Helm's fitness for the delicate task he undertook\\". A 1904 book, The Blue Fox, parodying the style of Guy Boothby, was less successful, with one review finding that it \\"starts well with a clever burlesque of the modern Anglo-American alliance between title and dollars\\", but later \\"misses fire somehow\\", being not sufficiently extravagant.\\"Novel Notes\\", St. James Gazette\\" (8 September 1904), p. 19.

The book, Jane Austen and her Country-house Comedy, was published that year, with The Athenaeum saying of it: The Book News Monthly wrote that Helm \\"takes up first the dominant qualities in Jane Austen's works, dilating upon her 'abiding freshness' and comparing her with Balzac and Charlotte Bronte. He then studies her equipment, going into the matter of her education and her preparation for writing\\".The Book News Monthly, Vol. 28 (1909), p. 620. The Guardian described it as demonstrating \\"critical discernment and literary knowledge\\".\\"Books and Bookmen\\", The Guardian (29 March 1913), p. 6. In the 21st century, literary scholar Laurence W. Mazzeno wrote that the book was \\"probably best described as a transitional work between the appreciations offered by the Austen family and many Victorians, and the more systematic critical examinations that would follow in the coming decades\\".Laurence W. Mazzeno, Jane Austen: Two Centuries of Criticism (2011), p. 31. Mazzano described Helm as being \\"of a generation still interested in the way Austen depicted the fashions and customs of her day\\", and noted that Helm considered Austen \\"a neglected classic\\", and sought to \\"reclaim for her a place among England's great authors\\". In 1910, after 27 years with The Morning Post, Helm was dismissed during a rearrangement of the staff. He sued, alleging wrongful dismissal and asserting that letters from former manager Edward Eden Peacock would demonstrate that the paper had a practice of providing for members of the literary staff dismissed after some number of years with the paper. Helm's 1912 book on Charles Dickens was deemed \\"an able and expert introduction on Dickens' life and works\\".\\"Dickens In Extract\\", The Monitor and New Era (14 September 1912), p. 11.  Homes of the Past (1921)  In 1919, Helm proposed \\"the selection and preservation some typical houses, each of which shall be an original example of a particular period in our history\\", along with their furnishings and other contents, so that people could visit them and learn what life during those periods was like.\\"Preserving the Past\\", The Times (October 17, 1919), p. 8.\\"Old Furniture Going Abroad\\", The Times (20 October 1919), p. 15. He further stated that he was preparing a book in support of this plan, for which \\"[m]any pen-and-ink drawings have already been prepared, in illustration of my text, by a very capable artist\\". Fine arts expert Archibald Cecil Chappelow illustrated the well-received 1921 book Homes of the Past, by Helm. The book was a favorite of publisher John Lane, and was \\"a magnificent volume\\".J. Lewis May, John Lane And The Nineties (1936), p. 141. The book review in The Observer stated: \\"Not only is this book pleasantly written, but it is much enhanced in attractiveness by the pen-and-ink drawings by Mr. A. C. Chappelow, who has a most affectionate touch for old architecture and furnishing\\".\\"The History of the Home\\", The Observer (25 September 1921), p. 4. In later life, Helm was described as \\"a distinguished East-Anglian antiquary who is also an ardent Francophile. Though he loves France, and speaks French easily, it cannot be denied that his accent leaves something to be desired\\". Helm once described giving a lecture in French to an audience of French nationals, after which one of them approached him and politely asked exactly what part of France Helm came from.

It produces beer types such as Dunkel, Helles, and Pilsner, plus seasonal Bock and Pale lagers. In 2016, it won awards from the Bavarian Brewers Association and the Bavarian State Beer Exhibition. History Aldersbach brewery The origins of the Aldersbach brewery, in the Klosterwinkel region close to Passau, go back to the High Middle Ages. In 1146, monks from Ebrach founded the Aldersbach Abbey. In a short time the place grew into an economic, cultural, and spiritual center. Soon after the monastery was founded, the monks started brewing beer. As early as 1268, the brewery was documented in an arbitration letter from Count Albert von Hals. This makes the Aldersbach brewery one of the oldest breweries in the world. Nevertheless, the main drink until the 16th century was wine, which was also grown in the area around Aldersbach. Climate changes and phylloxera disasters put an end to viticulture and beer became the main and popular drink in Bavaria. Until then, the monastery breweries were primarily responsible for the production of beer and the supply of the population, but from this point onward, castle breweries were established in many places, some of which still exist today. In the 17th century there was government intervention in the brewing rights. Even Aldersbach had to fear for its brewing rights, since the corresponding certificate was lost in the Thirty Years' War. In 1644, the monastery was re-confirmed by Elector Maximilian I. The increasing consumption of beer made it necessary to build a new brewhouse in 1734. The brewery museum is housed in this building today. In 1780 a new beer cellar was built. Secularization hit Aldersbach hard: in 1803 the monastery was dissolved and the brewery was initially sold to a beer brewer from Passau. A few years later, in 1811, Johann Adam von Aretin acquired the monastery brewery; as early as 1806 he had bought forest and arable land around Heidelberg Palace. The brewery is still owned by the family to this day. Aldersbach Brewery Museum In the course of the 19th century many smaller breweries in the area were bought up; Further acquisitions were made after the First World War and in the 1950s and 1960s, including the breweries in Gossersdorf and Konzell (Straubing-Bogen district) and a brewery in Lam (Cham (district)). The Aldersbach brewery, which has been run as a GmbH & Co KG since 1 January 2005, is still owned by the von Aretin family and is one of the most successful breweries in Bavaria today. In the summer of 2008, large parts of the Passau Peschl Brewery was bought, and since then the Aldersbach brewery has been supplying the former customers of Peschl-Br√§u with their beverages. The Aldersbacher Br√§ust√ºberl is particularly well-known, as you can bring your own snacks there. In 2016, the Bavarian State Exhibition \\"Beer in Bavaria\\" took place in Aldersbach. Both the historical and the modern brewery part could be visited. In 2018, the Aldersbach brewery celebrated its 750th anniversary.

Greene has expressed her commitment to painting as a way to explore feminism, materialism and beauty. Biography Greene was born in Seoul, Korea and lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. She received her BFA from San Francisco Art Institute, her MFA from the School of Visual Arts. Prior to becoming an artist, Greene earned her Ph. D in Political Science from Stanford University and a degree in International Relations from Seoul National University. Career Greene has shown her work at venues such as Sheldon Museum of Art, Muskegon Museum of Art, Brown University, Salisbury University, Wave Hill, Bronx Museum of Art, Noyes Museum, A.I.R. Gallery, Accola Griefen Gallery, Lodge Gallery, Kiechel Fine Art and Jane Lombard Gallery. She has also been a visiting artist and lectured with institutions such as the Brooklyn Museum, Maryland Institute College of Art, Union College, Salisbury University, SFAI, School of Visual Arts, Rutgers University. She is a faculty member in both the MFA and BFA departments at Parsons (The New School). In 2018 she was the MICA Genevi√®ve McMillan/Reba Stewart Endowed Chair in painting. The year after she was a semi-finalist for the Outwin Boochever painting prize and was a Bennet Prize finalist for women working in figurative painting. Work Greene's work primarily focuses on the feminist exploration of painting vis-√°-vis the combination of abstract patterns with representational forms. This strategy seeks to, \\"defamiliarize natural space and invite extended, sensual encounters with the paintings, where diverse representational modes coexist, and where the body appears as if seen for the first time\\". Instead of human figure, her earlier work used still-life, especially food items as allegorical stand-ins for the female subjectivity. Art writer and curator Emily Colucci commented about Greene's use of food and the bodily imagery, \\"Greene's painting not only provided a twist on Trump's notorious pussy-grabbing comment, but it also hinted at the papaya's vaginal qualities. The painting, particularly in the context of its title, humorously references the long legacy in feminist art of using food as a stand-in for the body as seen in works like Marilyn Minter's 100 Food Porn paintings.\\" In part spurred on by recent developments in the politics in America, Greene paints women in creative fields, posed to echo historical figurative paintings. Interviewing them and researching into their working lives generates ways to render pictorially‚Äîthrough allusions, icons, objects, patterns, and symbols‚Äîthe rich personhood of the subjects. Jorge Daniel Veneciano, former Director of the Sheldon Museum of Art, commenting on the vibrancy of the still-life genre in the era of transnationalism and globalism, states \\"Greene's recent painting provides an arch interpretation of the still-life genre and the promises it makes. The pun in the title, Archway to Happiness, may or may not be her intention, but it supports a reading of the work as satirically commenting on the very rhetoric of the genre. It also foregrounds the transnational nature of still lifes, carrying allusions to Celtic, Moorish, and pan-Asian cultures.\\" Influences Greene has expressed how the Pattern and Decoration movement of the 1970s and 80s had a large influence on her work. Her adoption of decorative patterns as the political statement of the marginalized also informs the status of her subjects.

He is currently a free agent. Verhagen has been contracted to several different professional football clubs, but never played an official match for a professional team. Danish police have charged Verhagen with rape, robbery, forgery, fraud and fleeing from the police, after his arrival in Viborg FF in November 2019. Since 27 November 2019, Verhagen has been remanded in custody - only interrupted by a 12-hour period as a fugitive after he managed to escape from police. On 24 June 2020, Verhagen was convicted of robbery and battery, but acquitted of rape, and was sentenced to one year and three months in prison and criminal deportation from Denmark. On 18 August 2020, he pleaded guilty to fraud and forgery. Career Verhagen briefly played in the youth academy of Dutch Eredivisie club Willem II. Afterwards, he was registered in three different amateur clubs in the Netherlands: TSC Oosterhout, VV Oosterhout and SC Den Dungen. In 2019, Verhagen signed a contract with Dinamo-Auto Tiraspol in the Moldovan breakaway state of Transnistria, despite only having appeared as an amateur footballer and never having earned a professional contract. Verhagen never made his debut for the club. He left Dinamo-Auto months later, and moved to South African Premier Soccer League club Cape Town City. The club had received recommendations about Verhagen by a person pretending to be the acclaimed Dutch player agent Mo Sinouh from the Stellar Group agency. Again, Verhagen was only at the club for about one month, again without making any appearances, after which he was signed by Chilean club Audax Italiano. He played no matches for Audax Italiano and was only a part of the club for about a month. He since stated that he was subjected to racism by his teammates in Chile. Audax Italiano had been told that they could resell Verhagen to an unspecified Chinese club for $2 million. On 5 November 2019, Viborg FF presented Verhagen as their new player. Viborg's director of sports, Jesper Fredberg, described Verhagen as a \\"lightning fast and aggressive player who will fit in well here and can cover all three attacking positions in our tactics\\". Shortly afterwards, a club statement was issued which said that they had never seen him play before the contract was signed. On 26 November 2019, Viborg FF announced in a press release that the club had terminated Verhagen's contract by mutual agreement and that the club had also reported him to the police. As had happened with Cape Town City, Viborg FF had been persuaded by an agent posing as Mo Sinouh from the renowned agency Stellar Group. Furthermore, Viborg FF had been offered the prospect of selling Verhagen on to Chinese club Hebei Elite with a profit in a short time. Verhagen made no appearances for Viborg FF. Personal life Verhagen is a Dutch citizen. He has a daughter in Denmark, but the mother has custody of the child.

According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the community had a population of 451,481 in 2019, with 52,516 originating from Hong Kong and 18,820 from Macau, the 2 special administrative regions of China. The community of Chinese nationals are the 2nd largest foreign community in Singapore, constituting 18% of the country's foreign-born population. Chinese migration to Singapore has been happening since the 19th century, after the founding of Singapore as a free port by Stamford Raffles in 1819. The demand for a skilled workforce and labour in Singapore was the driving force for attracting Chinese migrants to Singapore during that period of time. Today, newer Chinese migrants includes migrant workers working in various industries of the Singapore economy, with a mix of blue-collar workers and white-collar workers, as well as students. History During the 19th century, Chinese migration to Southeast Asia was a common occurrence. Many were unskilled and migrated from China to Southeast Asia for jobs during the colonial period of the region. In 1821, the first Chinese junk arrived in Singapore, then a newly founded British port. During this period of time, the port of Singapore became one of the largest hubs in Asia, beating out Batavia (present day Jakarta, Indonesia) as an international trading port. By 1871, due to the influx of migrants from Malaya, China, India and other parts of Asia, Singapore's population had reached nearly 100,000, with over half of them being Chinese. By the 1930s, there were 4 million ethnic Chinese living in Southeast Asia, forming a significant minority population within different territories in the region. Today, descendants of early Chinese migrants make up the bulk of the population of Chinese Singaporeans. Newer Chinese migration today began from the 1980s, with many of them working in blue-collared jobs during Singapore's rapid industrialisation which began in the 1970s. During 1989, after the Tiananmen Square protests, the Singaporean government offered 25,000 permanent residency status to Hong Kong residents for them to settle in Singapore. One of the reasons was also to maintain the racial percentage of the 3 major ethnic groups in Singapore, with Singaporeans migrating aboard and to offset the declining birth rate. Education in Singapore is also another reason for migration, with the Singaporean government providing scholarships to attract international students outside of ASEAN countries. These includes pre-tertiary and undergraduate institutions, and although the scholarships are bond-free, recipients would have to work in a Singaporean company for a period of time before they can leave the country. Demographics In 1990, according to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, among the 177,245 Chinese nationals residing in Singapore, there were a total of 150,447 from the Chinese mainland, 15,043 from Hong Kong and 11,755 from Macau residing in Singapore. In 2000, the number of Chinese nationals increased to 311,501 individuals. Individuals from mainland China and Hong Kong increased by 66.3% and 70.7% respectively while the number of Chinese nationals from Macau decreased by 16.1% for that year. Since then, the population of Chinese nationals residing in Singapore has increased steadily and it reached a total population of 532,734 in 2015, before falling to 451,481 in 2019. One of the reasons for the decline might be due to the Singapore government tightening immigration rules in that same year for hiring foreigners. In 2020, policies on hiring foreigners were further amended by the Ministry on Manpower to encourage companies to practice fair employment practices. Integration into Singaporean society Integration of newer Chinese migrants has been harder due to different cultural behaviours and norms between Singaporeans. With the increase of Chinese nationals in Singapore, they are stereotyped to have uncivilised and objectionable behaviours while being out in public. The high influx of immigrants into Singapore has also resulted increasingly xenophobic behaviour against some foreign communities in Singapore. Another reason would be the perception that the Singaporean government gives special treatment to foreigners or permanent residents as compared to Singaporeans, even though some of them do not pledge allegiance to the country. Some newer Chinese migrants tend to regard Singapore as a Chinese society, as a large majority of the Singaporean population is of ethnic Chinese descent, with a \\"sense of familiarity\\". This results in some of the newer migrants choosing not to communicate in or learn the country's lingua franca, English resulting in misunderstandings and thus, being unable to integrate well into Singaporean society. Controversies ;Wang Peng Fei derogatory video incident In July, 2011, Wang Peng Fei, then a student of East Asia Institute of Management, uploaded a video making derogatory comments about Singaporeans and Singapore culture. Amongst other topics mentioned in the video were comments about Singapore's low fertility rate and racist comments against Indian Singaporeans. Wang was expelled after the release of the video and a police report was also made against him for his comments, which is a chargeable offence under Singaporean law if found convicted. ;Curry incident In August, 2011, a new migrant Chinese family was reported to have complained about the smell of their Indian Singaporean neighbour cooking curry. Despite their neighbour closing windows and doors of their home when they were cooking the dish, the Chinese family wanted their neighbours to not cook the dish entirely, which was part of Singaporean cuisine. After the dispute was reported in the newspaper, it received public backlash from Singaporeans and negative comments, mainly towards the Chinese migrant family. A Facebook movement to in response to the Chinese family's comments was also started. The dispute was mediated by the Community Mediation Centre, under the Ministry of Law and an compromise was reached between the two families. ;Sun Xu 'dogs' comment In February 2012, Sun Xu, an undergraduate with the National University of Singapore under a scholarship provided by the Ministry of Education made derogatory comments against Singaporeans on his microblog. After the post came to light, Sun was fined S$3,000 by NUS and had his scholarship was revoked. He also had to pay back the scholarship benefits that he received, as well as serve community service with the university for three months.

On Wednesday, February 7, 2001, the Airbus A320, which took off from Barcelona-El Prat Airport, Spain, encountered a microburst induced wind shear on final approach to Bilbao Airport, Spain. The wind shear caused the plane's landing gear to collapse. All 143 occupants on the aircraft survived, but 25 people were injured; one seriously. The aircraft was substantially damaged and written off, making it the ninth loss of an Airbus A320. This accident prompted Airbus to develop a modification for its flight control software by preventing the airplane's built-in protection against stall from being activated by a high rate of change for the angle of attack.  Aircraft  The aircraft was manufactured for Iberia in 2000. It had also made its first flight in 2000. At the time of the accident, it had flown for 1,149 hours and 869 cycles. The aircraft was equipped with 2 CFMI CFM56-5B4/P engines.  Crew Members  There were three cockpit crew and four cabin crew.  Cockpit Crew  The captain was a 42-year old Spanish male and held an Airline Transport Pilot License. He was qualified to fly Airbus A320 aircraft under instrument flight rules (IFR). At the time of the accident, he had a total of 10,805 flight hours. The first officer was a 27-year old Spanish male and held a Commercial Pilot License. He was qualified to fly Airbus A320 under instrument flight rules (IFR). At the time of the accident, he had a total of 2,670 flight hours. The trainee pilot, who flew under supervision, was a 24-year old Spanish male and held a Commercial Pilot License. At the time of the accident, he had a total of 423 flight hours.  Cabin Crew  There were four flight attendants on the aircraft.  Accident  On Wednesday, February 7, 2001, the Airbus A320 took off from Barcelona-El Prat Airport, Spain. The flight was normal until the final approach to Bilbao Airport. The Airbus encountered a microburst induced wind shear on final approach to the airport. The crew decided to perform a go-around, but failed, causing the plane's landing gear to collapse. A subsequent emergency evacuation was carried out. All 143 occupants on the aircraft survived, but 25 people were injured during the evacuation. One crew member and 23 passengers suffered minor injuries, while a female passenger was seriously injured. Seven injured passengers were taken to hospitals. The three pilots were not injured. The aircraft was substantially damaged and written off, making it the ninth loss of an Airbus A320.  Other Damage  The runway received minor damage upon the aircraft's hard landing. Two runway edge lights were broken.  Investigation  The Civil Aviation Accident and Incident Investigation Commission (CIAIAC) immediately launched an investigation into the accident, which took 5 years and 9 months. Investigation by the CIAIAC concluded: * ‚ÄúThe activation of the angle of attack protection system, which, under a particular combination of vertical gusts and windshear and the simultaneous actions of both crew members on the sidesticks, not considered in the design, prevented the plane from pitching up and flaring during the landing.\\"  Aftermath  This accident prompted Airbus to develop a modification for its flight control software by preventing the airplane's built-in protection against stall from being activated by a high rate of change for the angle of attack. Following this accident, the CIAIAC made four safety recommendations.

These albums were released individually in 1970 and 2017. Background A Boy Named Charlie Brown is the debut theatrical film based on the Peanuts comic strip by Charles M. Schulz. For the music score, producer Lee Mendelson recruited jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi, who had previously composed uptempo jazz melodies for the first six Peanuts television specials as well as the unaired documentary of the same name. Guaraldi did not compose new songs for the film, but instead fitted established compositions with a more \\"theatrical\\" treatment featuring lusher horn-filled arrangements. Instrumental tracks used in the film included new variations of the songs \\"Skating\\", \\"Baseball Theme\\", \\"Charlie Brown and His All-Stars\\", \\"Oh, Good Grief\\", \\"Blue Charlie Brown\\", and several versions of the Peanuts franchise theme song, \\"Linus and Lucy\\". Guaraldi also resurrected the non-Peanuts song \\"Lucifer's Lady\\" from his album The Eclectic Vince Guaraldi (1969), retitled \\"Kite Music (Lucifer's Lady)\\". To fill out the sound, Mendelson also hired composer/arranger John Scott Trotter (who also worked in concert with Guaraldi since 1966's It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown) and composer/singer Rod McKuen. When discussing the augmentation of Guaraldi's established jazz scores with additional musicians, Mendelson commented, \\"It wasn‚Äôt that we thought Vince's jazz couldn't carry the movie, but we wanted to supplement it with some 'big screen music.' We focused on Vince for the smaller, more intimate Charlie Brown scenes; for the larger moments, we turned to Trotter's richer, full-score sound.\\" Guaraldi's services were passed over entirely for the second Peanuts feature film, Snoopy Come Home, with Mendelson turning to longtime Disney composers, the Sherman Brothers, to compose the music score. The film included several original songs, some of which boasted vocals: \\"Failure Face\\", \\"I Before E\\" and \\"Champion Charlie Brown\\". McKuen wrote and sang the title song, as well as writing \\"Failure Face\\" and \\"Champion Charlie Brown\\". Trotter composed additional songs, like \\"Cloud Dreams\\", \\"Catatonic Blues\\" and \\"Bus Wheel Blues\\". A soundtrack album with dialogue from the film was released on the Columbia Masterworks label in 1970 titled A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Selections from the Film Soundtrack. The first all-music version of the soundtrack was released on CD by Kritzerland Records as a limited issue of 1,000 copies in 2017, titled A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack. A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Selections from the Film Soundtrack A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Selections from the Film Soundtrack is the first of two soundtracks issued for the film, released in early 1970. The soundtrack was a commercial success and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score, ultimately losing to The Beatles' Let It Be. A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Selections from the Film Soundtrack was out of print by 1973. , it has not been issued on CD. Unlike traditional music soundtracks, A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Selections from the Film Soundtrack was presented as a condensed book-and-record radio play version of the film, running approximately 50 minutes in length. Most musical segments act as underscores behind dialogue. Several recording sessions occurred between April and October 1969, all under the supervision of John Scott Trotter. He and jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi booked several jazz combos for one date; Guaraldi worked solely with trio sidemen Peter Marshall and Jerry Granelli on another.  Track listing  Despite individual tracks being listed on the album, track running times for each title were not published.  A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack  A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the second of two soundtracks issued for the film. It was released on CD by Kritzerland Records in 2017 with a limited run of 1,000 copies,A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack at kritzerland.com which sold out within one week of release. Vince Guaraldi historian and author Derrick Bang referred to the 2017 release as the \\"Guaraldi Holy Grail\\" for fans of the jazz pianist. For many years, the logistics involved in releasing a music-only soundtrack were daunting. Licensing issues were complex as both Columbia Masterworks Records and Cinema Center Films had ceased to exist decades earlier and asset ownership passed along to a number of subsequent corporate entities. The music itself also posed challenges, as it involved not only Guaraldi's estate (Guaraldi died in 1976), but those associated with John Scott Trotter and Rod McKuen, who had died in 1975 and 2015, respectively.  Track listing  Track 18, \\"Linus and Lucy (Found Blanket)\\", is the same flute-driven, monaural version used during the cold open scene in It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (1966).

Several mobile device manufacturers included preloaded games in the wake of Snake's success. By the early 2000s, the technical specifications of handsets had matured to the point where downloadable applications (including games) could be supported, however mainstream adoption continued to be hampered by market fragmentation between different devices, operating environments, and distributors. The introduction of the iPhone and its dedicated App Store provided a standard means for developers of any size to develop and publish games for the popular smartphone. Several early success stories from app developers in the wake of the App Store's launch in 2008 attracted a large number of developers to speculate on the platform. Most initial games were published as premium (pay- once) titles, but the addition of in-app purchases in October 2009 allowed games to try other models, with notable successes Angry Birds and Cut the Rope using a combination of free-to-try and ad-supported games. Apple's success with the App Store drastically altered the mobile landscape and within a few years left only its and Google's Android-based smartphones using its Google Play app store as the dominant players. A major transition in game monetization came with the introduction of Candy Crush Saga and Puzzle & Dragons, taking gameplay concepts from social-network games which generally required the player to wait some length of time after exhausting a number of turns for a day, and offering the use of in-app purchases to refresh their energy. These games generated revenue numbers previously unseen in the mobile game sector, and became the standard for many freemium games that followed. Many of the most successful games have hundreds of millions of players, and have annual revenues exceeding a year, with the top games breaking . More recent trends have included hyper-casual games such as Crossy Road and location-based games like Pok√©mon Go. Prior to mobile phones Early precursors of mobile gaming include handheld electronic games and early handheld video game consoles, though these devices were always game-oriented with nearly no utility function. Personal digital assistants (PDAs), precursors themselves to modern smartphones, arrived in 1984, and early models included built-in or add-ons games such as with the Sharp Wizard in 1989. As most PDAs used low resolution monochromatic liquid crystal display (LCD)s designed for displaying text over graphics, these gamed tended to be simple, which included block or tile games like Tetris. These types of games carried over into some of the earlier smartphone models but did not have as much popularity, such as on the Hagenuk MT-2000 in 1993. Introducing gaming on smartphones (1997‚àí2006) Snake being played on the screen of a Nokia 3310 handset In 1997, Nokia introduced its Nokia 6110 mobile phone which included a variation of Snake. Snake proved to be one of the phone's popular features, and Nokia continued to include the game, or a variation of it, on nearly every phone it released since, with about 400 million devices shipped with the game installed as of 2016. Snake showed there was a viable interest in expanding the capabilities of mobile phones for gaming applications. With the introduction of the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), many mobile phones were able to access limited browser-based games, and later downloading new apps that could be purchased from their wireless carrier or a third party distributor to use on their phone. However, at this stage, in the early 2000s, there was a wide discrepancies of technologies available in terms of both hardware and software. Phones were still of a wide ranges of form factors, input features, and screen resolutions, so game developers were typically focused their efforts on specific software platforms and subsets of available devices. Additionally, a range of sofware platform standards, like J2ME, Macromedia Flash Lite, DoJa, and Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless (BREW), existed, the implementations of which varied by phone manufacturer and model, further limiting portability of games. Thus, while games were developed for mobile devices over the next several years, they tended to be limited. Mobile game discoverability was further complicated by the limitations of the early mobile internet. Games were often primarily offered via a content store provided by a wireless carrier (the \\"carrier deck\\"). Publishers would license games for inclusion on these portals. These stores tended to be largely text- based, offering very limited descriptions of products or sophisticated search and navigation. As a result, games promoted by carriers (thereby appearing nearer the top of the store) tended to be greatly more successful, while others listed below would not be seen by many users who did not scroll beyond the first page of the deck. Prior to 2007, Japan was the leading developer for games on handsets since most of the primary handset developers were located there and smartphones had a greater proliferation among the population. A wide array of various genres were tried, including virtual pet games which used early camera features as part of the gameplay cycle. Meanwhile, handheld consoles still typically offered superior gaming experiences compared to the limited smartphone games; Nintendo had released its Game Boy Advance in 2001 as a successor to the widely popular Game Boy. To try to merge the two markets, Nokia released the N-Gage in 2003, designed as both a handheld console and a phone. The N-Gage was able to offer similar video games as the Advance, but even with its N-Gage QD redesign in 2004, the unit was a commercial failure. The iPhone and the App Store (2007‚àí2008) The iPhone (a iPhone 4 shown, screen blurred) drastically changed both the smartphone market and the mobile game industry. Apple, Inc. had been an early player in the PDA market with the Apple Newton, but Steve Jobs had discontinued the line in 1998 to focus the company's hardware towards devices like the iMac and iPod. Under Jobs' direction, the same teams worked to develop the iPhone, which Apple first released in June 2007. Among key hardware features in the iPhone was a large random access memory (RAM) size compared to most other smartphones on the market as well as a larger screen, making it capable of running more complex apps, and a new iOS operating system that could handle multitasking, far surpassing any other device on the market at the time. The iPhone also included various sensors such as an accelerometer, and excluding the first generation, also included a capacitive touchscreen that did not require any stylus and could be controlled by a finger, with later models adding support for multipoint sensing. Alongside the release, Apple affirmed that third-party apps could be developed for the phone's iOS operating system and distributed through an App Store, made available to users in July 2008; Apple made terms of using the tools and App Store low-cost and easy to use to encourage development of third-party apps. Developers, including game developers, rushed to take advantage of the App Store. At launch, there were 500 apps, while six months later, there were over 15,000, along with over half a billion app downloads. One such early success was Trism, a tile-matching game incorporating the phone's accelerometer released near the App Store launch developed by a single person, Steve Demeter. Demeter had priced the game at , and within two months of launch, had made in profit, and Demeter was highly publicized as a rags to riches story on the lucrative nature of developing for the iPhone. Another early success was Tap Tap Revenge, a rhythm game by Tapulous, which also was released at the App Store's launch and saw over one million downloads in 20 days. Following on similar stories, numerous smaller developers tried to release the next big game, while larger game publishers took to their existing catalogs and released mobile-compatible titles where possible. PopCap Games, which had already had success with a line of computer and browser-based puzzle games such as Bejeweled, was one of the first companies to transition their products to mobile versions in 2009 which helped them to rapidly grow their mobile business, leading to their acquisition by Electronic Arts in 2011 as to allow Electronic Arts to compete in the mobile and casual games area. Beyond games, the iPhone and App Store caused most other smartphone manufacturers to abandon their own attempts to build out a more sophisticated smartphone environment, such as BlackBerry and Symbian. Only two major competitors remained after the iPhone's introduction, the Android-based devices (based on the Java language), using the operating system that had been developed by Google, and Windows Phone by Microsoft which has close interoperability with its Microsoft Windows operating system. Both took up the same approach as Apple, introducing app stores in Google Play and Windows Phone Store, respectively, with similar developer policies. Ultimately, Microsoft ceased active development of Windows Phone, leaving iOS and Android as the principle players in the mobile operating system and app store market. Angry Birds: transitioning from premium to free-to-play (2009‚Äì2011) As launched, the iOS App Store only allowed single-time purchases of apps akin to how one purchased music from iTunes, so most games were purchased on the traditional \\"premium\\" model, buying the game upfront. In October 2009, the store introduced \\"in-app purchases\\" (IAP), microtransactions that an app could offer with the transaction made through the App Store's storefront. Some existing app devs were savvy to jump on this; Tapulous released Tap Tap Revenge 3 shortly after this change that included IAP to obtain new songs. Similar IAPs were added to the Google Play store on Android as well. In December 2009, Rovio Entertainment released Angry Birds on the App Store, a physics-based game involving launching cartoonish birds at structures occupied by pigs that have stolen their eggs as to do as much damage as possible, which had been inspired by the browser game Crush the Castle and others like it. As released on the iOS store, it was a still a premium game at , and its low cost, as well as being featured by Apple in February 2010, led to it becoming highly successful and leading the Top Paid App charts by mid-2010. When Rovio ported the game to Android, they introduced an ad- supported version that could be downloaded for free, but a user could pay to remove the ads, such that Rovio gained revenue from both the IAP and the ads, which shortly after the Android's release in October 2010, was estimated to be about a month. Another game, Cut the Rope, released on both iOS and Android at the same time, followed a model of releasing a free version with a few levels, and with an in-game purchase to unlock the rest of the game. It was one of the fastest-selling games on the iOS App Store at that time according to its publisher Chillingo. Mobile game development was also not limited to the English-speaking world, as Japan and many Asian countries had an active mobile development scene. As the app stores on iOS and Android had regional distinctions, apps developed in different regions typically would not be available in others unless translated or localized. An important region during this period is China. Separate from most other markets, the Chinese video game industry had been relatively small prior to 2008 due to poor economic conditions. The Chinese government set about trying to improve the economic welfare of the country and introduce more high technology education and jobs. However, computer costs remained high and importing consoles were difficult, so many used PC bangs, giving rise to free-to-play or subscription based games like massively multiplayer online games (MMOs). China is also recognized for creating social-network games with Happy Farm, developed by 5 Minutes in 2008, which served as direct inspiration for FarmVille. Apple further introduced the iPad in 2010, its tablet computer based on similar design principles as the iPhone. While tablets had existed before as descendants of PDAs, the iPad was the first tablet to achieve mass-market success. Part of the iPad's success was using iOS for its operating system, assuring that all apps and games on the App Store worked for the iPad as they did for the iPhone. Android-based phone manufacturers followed suit with their own suite of Android-based tablet in the years that followed to create a similar dichotomy. Mobile game developers had a whole new audience available to them without any extra work, while others saw potential in tablet-based games due to the larger screen space that they offered. These could be geared towards children for educational purposes or elderly where hand dexterity is not as agile to use a smaller screen. Amazon developed its own Amazon Fire tablet first released in 2011 with Quanta Computer with its own customized version of Android as a means to offer digital products from its storefront to users which included apps and games. Candy Crush Saga and Puzzle & Dragons: Establishing the freemium model (2012‚Äì2014) While casual games like Angry Birds and Cut the Rope were gaining success on mobile devices, the development of new social network sites using advanced web browser technology on personal computers, such as Facebook, gave rise to free-to-play browser games and social-network games, generally supported by ads on the hosting website. One of the most notable examples of these is Zynga's FarmVille, released in 2009. The farm management simulation game had the player work to raise crop and tend livestock on a virtual farm, but were only afforded a limited number of actions per day. Players, however, could engage their Facebook friends to ask for extra actions, and give extra actions back when requested. The \\"time- lapse\\" or \\"energy\\" gameplay mechanics was heavily criticized by traditional game designers since any reasonable progression required one to commit time to the game. However, the game was considered highly successful, with more than 80 million players by February 2010. Zygna's success with Farmville drew gamers away from non-social browser games on portal sites. King, who ran one such portal site, was impacted by this and decided to change their own model to incorporate Facebook games that worked alongside their portal games. One of the first games King offered on this approach was Bubble Witch Saga, released in October 2011. Bubble Witch Saga used mechanics similar to the older game Puzzle Bobble, where players shot colored orbs to clear away matching orbs. However, as to avoid the drawn-out gameplay that FarmVille was noted for, King introduced the \\"saga\\" model; the game was divided into a number of levels which each was effectively a puzzle. The player had a number of turns (shots) to clear the board or meet other conditions. If they did this, they were able to continue, but otherwise they lose one \\"life\\", though these lives would regenerated in real-time, or players could ask friends on Facebook for free lives. The game thus only required the player to commit a few minutes each day. By January 2012, Bubble Witch Saga had over 10 million players and was the fastest-growing game on Facebook. King followed this with Candy Crush Saga on its portal and Facebook by April 2012, a more direct tile-matching game but using the same \\"saga\\" approach, which also enjoyed similar success. Buoyed by the success of these games, King opted to enter the mobile game market with these titles, developing ad-supported versions for iOS that synchronized with the portal and Facebook versions; Bubble Witch Saga for mobile was released in July 2012, and Candy Crush Saga in October 2012. Both games still integrated with Facebook to ask their friends for lives, but also included an in-app purchase to fully restore one's lives or on special powerup, however, the game was still designed to be playable without having to purchase these, and 70% of the players had been able to make it to the final level of the game (as of September 2013) without spending any money. Candy Crush Saga proved to be the more popular game, and by the end of 2013, King had seen over 400 million new players of the game and their revenues had jumped from in 2011 to from advertising revenue and in-app purposes. In June 2013, King opted to eliminate advertising in-game and simply let the mobile version of its games earn revenue from in-app purchases as they continued to release additional games. The strategy proved effective as by the final quarter of 2014, King had seen 356 million monthly unique players, with only 8.3 million spending money on their games (2.3%), but had brought in over per player per month, as to make over across its game portfolio that quarter. King's success with Candy Crush Saga created the freemium model that numerous mobile games that followed used. Separately, in Japan, developer GungHo Online Entertainment had released Puzzle & Dragons in February 2012 first in JApan, a tile-matching game with some role-playing elements that including improving one's team of \\"monsters\\". At the time of its release, one of the more popular mobile apps in Japan were card battle games, but GungHo believed they could improve on the formula. Like Candy Crush Saga, the game used regenerable \\"stamina\\" to limit how many times the player could play in a row, but could use in-app purchases to immediately restore their stamina, or obtain other forms of in-game currency. By October 2013 the game has been downloaded 20 million times in Japan (about 1/6th of the nation's population) and over a million times in North America, and was earning an estimated a day. News of these numbers caused GungHo's stock market capitalization to rise sharply in October as to surpass that of Nintendo at around , and further establishing the success of the freemium model for mobile games. In 2013, Apple was able to secure deals to distribute the iPhone cheaply in China. Because of the feature set and its relatively low cost compared to a computer, the iPhone became nearly ubiquitous for many Chinese residents. This spurred mobile game development within China particularly across the 2013-2014 period. These games followed the established freemium models from Candy Crush Saga and Puzzle & Dragons, using a mix of advertising and in-app purchases for revenue generation. Chinese publishers and developers, though limited by the type of content that they can release within the country due to the government's oversight of the media, were able to publish their games to the mobile app stores to release their titles beyond China, including to other southeast Asian countries or globally when possible, which helped to draw in additional revenue. This also led to some of the larger publishers within China, such as Tencent and Perfect World Games to establish foreign subsidiaries or acquire foreign companies to make them subsidiaries for mobile game development. Clash of Clans and the massively- multiplayer role-playing experience (2012‚àí2015) During this same period, Supercell released Clash of Clans in 2012. Clash of Clans is a strategy game that at its core has elements of city management and tower defense as the player oversees a fighting clan's home base. To obtain resources to maintain and upgrade the base, the player can send their forces to attack another player's base, which is handled asynchronously with the opposing player's forces managed by the computer. Should the attacking player win, they steal some resources from the losing player, while the losing player, when they next access the game, will learn of these loses. To encourage cooperation, players can join into \\"clans\\" which help to attack or defend automatically. Clash of Clan retains similar in-app purchases as with Candy Crush Saga and Puzzle & Dragons that can be used to rush certain building objectives, but also weigh heavily on social engagement similar to MMOs. By September 2014, the app was earning per day, and many users had reported playing the game for thousands of hours since its launch. Supercell considered part of its success to be able to draw in both casual and hardcore games with the Clash of Clans gameplay. Clash of Clans inspired numerous other games that gave a simulated multiplayer experience, including Game of War: Fire Age and Empires & Allies that typically required more of a time commitment and a deeper understanding of the game rules to be successful but still could be played in a casual manner. In China, Tencent released Honor of Kings in 2015, which when it was exported to other markets, rebranded as Arena of Valor. Honor/Arena built up on the type of gameplay found in League of Legends, a multiplayer online battle arena that had been built by Riot Games, an American company which Tencent had previously acquired. Riot had believed that League could not be replicated on mobile devices, leading Tencent and its Chinese studio TiMi Studios to develop Honor of Kings. Within China the game was a success with more than 50 million daily players, and spurred its own esports league by 2016. Tencent saw the potential for its global release, but replace the game's heavy Chinese mythology with more traditional fantasy characters in rebranding it to Arena. With its international release, Honor and Arena and combined have remained one of the top-grossing mobile games overall, with over in annual revenue in 2019. Crossy Road and the growth of the hyper-casual game (2014‚Äì2015) Around early 2015, a new type of gaming app emerged on the app stores, called hyper- casual games, with Crossy Road, by Hipster Whale considered one of the key examples in this period, though earlier games like Flappy Bird by dotGears in 2013 had displayed the same principles in gameplay. Hyper-casual games differentiated themselves from the bulk of existing app games by being small and lightweight downloads, using simple graphics, and having extremely simple rulesets, but were otherwise infinitely replayable. In the case of Crossy Road, the goal is to maneuver a character as far as possible across lanes of a busy road and avoiding traffic, a type of endless game of Frogger, earning in- game coins based on distance and any collected coins picked up that can be used to unlock new characters or buy power-ups. In-app purchases also could be used to buy coins, or coins could be earned through advertising. The game's monetization scheme was designed to avoid some of the bad reputation that in- app purchasing had been getting in recent years, using the lure of new characters to get players to spend money rather than to extend gameplay sessions. Within 90 days of release, the app had earned from over 50 million users. Other companies soon followed to build on the hyper-casual games market, with Voodoo and Ketchapp among those releasing a new wave of hyper- casual games with similar monetization schemes as Crossy Road. Often these games were reductions of other gameplay concepts or simple expansions of more trivial games: Voodoo's Paper.io was effectively a remake of Snake and its later Hole.io a simpler version of Donut County. Hyper-casual games have continued to gain popularity, both as easier games for players to get into compared to titles like Clash of Clans, and typically are much easier and cheaper to develop, and are said to have disrupted the mobile gaming market as much as Candy Crush Saga had done when it was introduced. For established studios, the rapid development time allowed them to publish more experimental titles which they could monitor to see if players took to enjoy them, and if any title became popular, they could commit more resources and advertising to it. Pok√©mon Go and location-based gaming (2016‚àí2017) Brest, France while playing Pok√©mon Go Under license from The Pok√©mon Company and Nintendo, Niantic released Pok√©mon Go in July 2016 as a freemium app for mobile phones. Having already had experience using location-based games with its prior Ingress title, Niantic used phones' GPS to map out nearby spots close to players where they could find and try to capture Pok√©mon to which they could then use at virtual local Pok√©mon gyms, also determined by GPS location. In game, Pok√©mon were shown to the player using augmented reality atop the camera's view so that the player knew they had found the Pok√©mon and engage in its capture. In-app purchases could be used to buy improved Pok√©balls used to capture Pok√©mon and other powerups and items to help one's Pok√©mon. Pok√©mon Go had record-breaking numbers of players, with both its initial iOS and Android releases seeing over 100 million players worldwide within a month of release. The game was recognized by the Guinness World Records for numerous milestones by August 2016. The game was a cultural phenomena for several months, in a wave of \\"Pok√©mon Go Mania\\", or \\"Pok√©mania\\", though also led to several incidents where due to how Niantic's servers has planned out Pok√©mon spots and gyms, people were flocking to private homes and sites. By the end of 2017, the game has grossed over in revenue, and has continued to bring in more than each year. While Pok√©mon Go was not the first location-based game released for mobile devices, it established a fundamental monetization model to make such a game work and that would engage the user in physical activity in moving to nearby local areas. It also was seen as a positive impact on social interactions since players would often interact face-to-face at the gyms. Other location-based games based on popular properties have since been released with similar gameplay and monetization models, including Harry Potter: Wizards Unite and Minecraft Earth. Video game analysts had been watching the mobile market for several years, in part due to the growth of mobile gaming from China. Market analysis firms identified that mobile gaming global gross revenues exceeded that of either personal computer or console games for the first time in 2016, earning around , and remained one of the fastest growing sectors of the video game market. Fortnite and cross- platform play (2018‚Äìpresent) In mid-2017, Epic Games released Fortnite, a third-person shooter with base-building elements as its Fortnite: Save the World component on personal computers in a early access model and then by September 2017 had released a standalone Fortnite Battle Royale mode, based on the success of the battle royale game genre from PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds released earlier that year. Fortnite Battle Royale rapidly grew popular, leading Epic to port the game to other systems, including onto mobile devices by mid-2018. From the launch, the mobile versions of the games supported cross-platform play with computer and console versions, one of the first games to incorporate mobile games into direct interactive cross-platform play. By June 2018, over 125 million registered players across all platforms. Revenue, earned through the purchase of in-game currency to buy customization options and battle passes, had brought the game to reach over in revenue daily by July 2018. A large portion of the game's audience are younger school-aged children being able to play it on their mobile phone, and parents and teachers expressed concern about the game's impact on coursework inside and out of school. Game subscription services and cloud gaming (2019‚àípresent) Apple introduced the Apple Arcade in September 2019 which worked with its iOS, macOS, and Apple TV. Comparable to Xbox Game Pass, users pay a flat monthly fee to gain access to a number of curated games, with new games added to the service periodic while other games are removed over time. Games on the service lack in-game purchase options or advertisements, but allow the user to purchase the game to keep to own, as well as store progress through their iCloud account if they purchase the game at a later time. Thus, games on the Apple Arcade tended to be those that resembled more traditional premium-priced games that were not built on microtransactions. Google followed suit with its own Google Play Pass, launched in the same month, but which also extended to general apps as well as games. Separately, both Microsoft and Google have been developing cloud gaming services in xCloud and Stadia that would allow console-quality games to be run and played on other devices included mobile phones. Currently, due to restricts Apple has on iOS applications, these cloud streaming services are only targeted at Android phones and devices. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 and 2020 caused many people around the globe to be quarantined or forced to stay at home to prevent transmission of the virus, and video games became a popular pastime. Mobile game saw a significant boost in revenues as a result of the pandemic, with a 40% increase year-to-year in the second quarter of 2020 according to Sensor Tower.

He was governor of Kasa√Ø Province in the Belgian Congo from 1952 to 1954. Early years and family Roger Le Bussy was born on 12 February 1901 in Herstal, Belgium. His parents were Louis le Bussy (1869‚Äì1957) and Maria Anna Julie Henriette Nina Dollard (1873‚Äì1938). His family included coal miners, needle makers and merchants of iron, lead and alum. He attended the Faculty of Political and Administrative Sciences at the Colonial University of Antwerp from 1921 to 1924. He married Emma Dulac, with whom he had one child, Paul. His second marriage was in 1931 to Emma Bodson, with whom he had another child, Roger. Colonial career Le Bussy's first term of duty in the Belgian Congo was from September 1924 to October 1927. His internship was in the √âquateur Province. He was then made a territorial administrator 2nd class in the Lake Leopold II District. In July 1927 he was promoted to territorial administrator 1st class. Le Bussy was head administrator of the Inongo Territory when he wrote a report on 27 September 1927 about the Ntombankole, a sub-tribe of the Ntomba people. He traced their history from their origins in the southern region of Lake Tumba to their settlement around Lake Leopold II. His second term was from June 1928 to July 1931. He was again assigned to Inongo Territory in Lake Leopold II District. In January 1930 he was promoted to principal territorial administrator. Le Bussy was once more assigned to Lake Leopold II District for his third term, starting in December 1931. On 10 November 1933 he was appointed deputy judge of the Lake Leopold II district court. In July 1934 he was appointed attach√© to the secretary general of AIMO (Affaires Indig√®nes et Main-d'Oeuvre: Indigenous and Labor Affairs). He went on leave from December 1934 to July 1935. On his return he was again principal territorial administrator, and in March 1937 was assigned to L√©opoldville Province. Le Bussy was appointed district commissioner 2nd class in July 1938. He took leave in Europe from January to July 1939. On his return le Bussy was appointed urban district commissioner of L√©opoldville. At the start of World War II (1939‚Äì1945) the colonial government decided to draw up a five-year plan for the development of L√©opoldville. The plan centered on the main boulevard. First a roundabout had to be developed around the site of the Albert I monument, followed by the drainage network and the road in front of the station. Work went slowly. On 24 September 1941 Le Bussy ordered that funds for contruction of a bridge were to be diverted to coating the boulevard in vibrated concrete. The boulevard became the first axis of the city to have sanitary facilities. In January 1944 le Bussy and Vice Governor General Paul Ermens inaugurated the new native market in Leopoldville. It was to the southeast of the old covered market, moved there to let the European commercial district expand. Le Bussy was promoted to district commissioner 1st class in February 1943. Due to the wartime occupation of Belgium by Germany, his leave was in Astrida, Rwanda, and lasted only from February to April 1943. His sixth term of service lasted from April 1943 to October 1945. From June 1946 to June 1949 Le Bussy was commissioner of Uele District. From December 1949 to December 1951 he was assigned to the governor of Kivu Province. Le Bussy returned after leave in March 1952, and in July 1952 was promoted to provincial governor and placed in charge of Kasai Province. He replaced Firmin Peigneux. He was relieved of his duties due to unfitness for colonial service in June 1954. He formally left office on 27 March 1955, and was replaced by Jean Paelinck. He died on 13 September 1967.

Despite repeated denials that mustard gas had been present on any Allied ships in the harbor, Alexander was able to determine that a ship loaded with mustard gas shells had blown up and that the mustard gas had mixed with the oil floating in the harbor, which acted as a solvent and allowed the chemical warfare agent to be absorbed into the skin of military personnel who had been floating in the water. Though Alexander's detailed report documenting the presence of mustard gas was censored and suppressed for fears that the Nazis would be emboldened to use the chemical warfare agent, his medical reporting showed that the mustard gas had severely impacted the formation of white blood cells in his patients, a finding that led to the development of chemotherapeutic treatments for leukemia that were based on the chemistry of mustard gas.

Typography, as an aspect of cartographic design, is the craft of designing and placing text on a map in support of the map symbols, together representing geographic features and their properties. It is also often called map labeling or lettering, but typography is more in line with the general usage of typography. Throughout the history of maps to the present, their labeling has been dependent on the general techniques and technologies of typography.  History  Abraham Ortelius map of Europe, about 1600, produced (including text) by copper engraving. For most of most of the history of Cartography, the text on maps was hand drawn, and Calligraphy was an essential part of the skill set of the cartographer. This did not change with the advent of printing in the 15th Century, because the dispersed placement of the text did not lend itself to the use of Movable type. Instead, printed maps, including text, where drawn, engraved, and printed using the Intaglio or \\"copperplate\\" process. It was typical for the cartographer to not label the map himself, but to leave it to the master engraver. Text styles frequently changed with the tastes of the time, but were often very ornate, especially in non-map elements such as the title. The development of Photoengraving, Zincography, and wax engraving in the mid-19th Century significantly changed the production of maps and their labels, enabling the addition of printed type to maps using stamps, but map lettering still required a great deal of skill; this remained the state of the art until the development of Photolithography in the 1950s. The photographic platemaking process meant that type could be produced on paper in a variety of ways, producing map labels of the same quality as book text. That said, as late as 1960, Arthur H. Robinson still advised new cartographers to be skilled in freehand lettering, and mechanical lettering tools were still in common usage through the 1980s, encouraging a very simplistic functional style over any aesthetic character. A significant turning point was \\"Die Anordnung der Namen in der Karte\\", a 1962 essay (re-published in English in 1975) by Swiss cartographer Eduard Imhof, considered the greatest European cartographer of his day. Imhof analyzed the best maps he could find, such as the Swisstopo topographic maps, deriving a set of general principles and guidelines for type design and placement, which subsequent research has largely corroborated and further developed, and which forms the core canon on the topic found in modern cartography textbooks. In 1972, Pinhas Yoeli began to codify Imhof's guidelines mathematically, setting the stage for Automatic label placement. In 2000, Clifford Wood extended Imhof's guidelines, based on the intervening 25 years of research and practice. The rise of Desktop publishing around 1990, including graphics software, laser printers, and inkjet printers, combined with the improving design capabilities of Geographic information systems, greatly increased and facilitated the more thoughtful design and use of type on maps. A wealth of typefaces became available, and it became easy to place text anywhere on the map. This completed the shift of skill in map typography from construction to design.  Purposes and goals of map labels  In this map of Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah, most of the text identifies features, but there is also text that proscribes (\\"No Trailers\\"), describes (\\"private property\\"), categorizes (\\"... Canyon\\"), and locates (\\"Paunsaugunt Plateau\\"). The typeface subtly characterizes the map, being consistently used on all maps and publications of the U.S. National Park Service. Text simultaneously serves several purposes on maps. In 1993, D. J. Fairbairn introduced a taxonomy of the purposes of text on maps, identifying fourteen types of text role. Since then, others, such as cartography textbooks, have described the variety of roles of text, with the following generally being the most common: * Identifying unique features, such as \\"The United Kingdom\\" * Categorizing features into groups, such as \\"Smith Park\\" * Describing or explaining information that cannot be directly derived from the map symbols or corroborating the symbolized information, such as \\"Box Lake (dry),\\" a note on the history of a building, or varying the size of city labels according to population to the size of the city symbols. * Locating features that are not shown by a distinct symbol, such as \\"Arabian Sea\\" or \\"Rocky Mountains.\\" * Prescribing or Proscribing action, such as \\"No Camping.\\" * Organizing the conceptual structure of the map as a whole, such as strengthening the visual hierarchy. * Beautifying the map as a whole. * Characterizing the map with a particular aesthetic feel, such as using a typeface that looks playful, modern, or historical.  Aims and goals of cartographic typography  In 1929, Ordnance Survey cartographer Captain John G. Withycombe, in a critique of the state of map lettering, listed five essential aims of cartographic typography. * Legibility: readers must be able to read the text, especially, as Withycombe states, \\"when superimposed upon the detail of a map.\\" * Reproducibility: this may not be as problematic as in 1929, but even modern technologies (especially computer screens) can have difficulty with the relatively small sizes of map labels, especially in colors other than solid black. * Style: Withycombe points out that careful choice of \\"alphabet\\" (typeface) contributes not only to aesthetic appeal, but also to the two aims above. * Contrast: labels for different kinds of features should themselves look different. * Harmony: the various typefaces and styles used should work and look good good together, and should produce an overall look of order and professionalism. In his 1962 paper, Imhof reiterated the primary importance of legibility, and added the following requirements (listed here with modern terminology); he then showed how most specific guidelines and practices are derived from these principles: * Association: the reader must be able to clearly connect each label to the feature it is labeling. Withycombe's contrast is an important part of this. * Conflict avoidance: many of the above aims can be aided by placing labels so they do not overlap too many map features, especially other labels. * Extent: labels should help to indicate the spatial extent of the features they label, as well as their distinction from other features * Hierarchy: like the symbols for each feature, Withycombe's contrast in lettering can be used to strengthen the Visual hierarchy of features in the map. * Distribution: \\"Names should not be evenly dispersed over the map, nor should names be densely clustered.\\" In subsequent literature, textbooks, and the GIS&T; Body of Knowledge, legibility, association, and hierarchy are typically listed as the most crucial of these aims, while conflict avoidance is one of the core foundations of Automatic label placement.Guidero, E. (2017). Typography. The Geographic Information Science & Technology Body of Knowledge (3rd Quarter 2017 Edition), John P. Wilson (ed.). DOI: 10.22224/gistbok/2017.3.2 Type styling Typographic style variables commonly used in maps Many of the aspects of type styling can be chosen and controlled by the cartographer when designing a particular label to serve the above purposes. In this sense, they are akin to the visual variables of map symbology; in fact, Jacques Bertin extended his own visual variable system to including type styling in 1980 (in French). This work has largely been ignored in English-speaking countries, although similar ideas have been developed by others. The most commonly cited and used typographic variables include: * Form is akin to shape in the original visual variables, and serves much the same purpose, to differentiate nominal variables, most often to distinguish different classes of features (city vs. river vs. mountain vs. country). In addition to the following, Bertin also includes other shape variations, such as width (condensed, compressed, extended, etc.) and texture or patterned fills, which are used less often in maps due to their effect on legibility. ** Typeface (\\"type shape variation\\" in Bertin 1980), in addition to its common use to differentiate feature type, has a major influence on the aesthetics of the map. ** Posture (which Bertin likens to orientation), whether roman, italic, or oblique, is typically used like typeface to differentiate feature types. Wood mentions the common use of italics for labeling hydrographic features, due to its curving form that suggests water flow. ** Case (\\"sign shape variation\\" in Bertin 1980) has a more ordinal sense than typeface or posture, and many cartographers use ALL CAPS to indicate larger features or special types such as national capitals. Its role in visual hierarchy is debatable: at times, upper case seems to stand out because the characters are larger, but at other times it seems to recede because the characters are less interesting than Title Case. * Orientation, the direction the characters are aligned, is used much more commonly with type than with map symbols. The most common reason to have text not be horizontal is to follow linear features, and sometimes elongated area features (which Imhof calls \\"ribbon-like\\"). * Size (usually measured by the block height in points) is usually used for a piece of text in a similar fashion as the map symbol it is labeling: to indicate the geographic extent of the feature, to fit into the visual hierarchy, or to represent some quantitative variable. * Spacing between characters ( tracking), words, and lines (leading) is often varied on maps for a variety of purposes. For example, Imhof suggests using character spacing to spread an area label over the entire area feature, but counsels against doing the same for line labels. * Weight, whether bold, black, light, or something in between, was considered by Bertin as a value- like variable, suggesting that it has an ordinal representation and a strong influence on visual hierarchy. * Hue, one of Bertin's original visual variables, is rarely used in type to carry information on its own, although there are exceptions, such as using red (with its connotation of danger) for warnings. Instead, hue is usually used to match the text to the hue of the symbol it is labeling, strengthening its association. * Value, also one the core visual variables, is typically used to match the value of associated symbols, although often darker, because lighter text can be less legible and have reproducibility problems, especially when printed. It is also commonly used for emphasis in the visual hierarchy. * Decoration, additional symbols attached to the text, is used differently on maps than in block text. Common decorations such as underline and strikeout are rarely used, but a halo or mask, hiding the underlying features around a label, is often used to increase legibility where there are many features that cannot be avoided.Peterson, Gretchen N. GIS Cartography: A Guide to Effective Map Design (2nd ed.). Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press (2015). 89-90. A callout box or leader line are forms of decoration that are added to aid feature association when a label cannot be placed adjacent to the feature. Another form of decoration are highway shields, symbols attached to route numbers, usually to make them look like the signs seen along the highway.  Placement  Determining the ideal location for each label that needs to be on the map is a complex process, with hundreds or thousands of labels competing for space, in addition to the map symbols which are usually more important. It is not a purely subjective decision process; for each label, some locations meet the aims above (especially legibility and association) better than others. An understanding of what makes some placement better than others thus streamlines the process of creating an effective map. Early textbooks provided some general advice, but the primary contribution of Imhof's 1962 (English 1975) paper was to analyze the best practices of cartographers, and set forth a clear set of rules for label placement.Imhof, Eduard, ‚ÄúDie Anordnung der Namen in der Karte,‚Äù Annuaire International de Cartographie II, Orell-F√ºssli Verlag, Z√ºrich, 93-129, 1962. English Translation: \\"Positioning Names on Maps,\\" The American Cartographer, V.2 #2 (1975), pp.128-144 Since then, there has been surprisingly little research into the validity of these rules, especially compared to the numerous psychophysical studies examining many other parts of the map. Even Wood's 2000 update of Imhof, which adds many more guidelines, seems to still be based largely on best practices rather than science. That said, the durability of many of them, in the face of sweeping changes in technology and the capabilities of textual design, and their continued use in professional practice, points to their strength. After decades, only a few of Imhof's original rules have fallen out of favor. Between Imhof, Wood, and other sources (especially textbooks), it is possible to list dozens of label placement rules.Tyner, J. A. (2010) Principles of Map Design, 1st edition, The Guilford Press, pp.43-56.Peterson, Gretchen N. GIS Cartography: A Guide to Effective Map Design (2nd ed.). Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press (2015). 91. However, dutiful reliance on such lists can be misleading. According to Wood, The \\"sense of the guidelines\\" Wood mentions are the aims of legibility, feature association, and a harmonious aesthetic of the map as ordered, professional, and clear. Almost all suggested guidelines can be deduced by evaluating possible labels according to those aims. From the various lists of placement guidelines, the following is a sample of those most commonly emphasized: General guidelines CIA Map of Peru, generally following standard guidelines for point, line, and area labels. Several exceptions were made to those guidelines when the situation necessitated such. * To aid association, labels should be placed as close to the associated map symbol as possible, without touching it (which would reduce legibility and recognition of the symbol). * In terms of orientation, horizontal text is easiest to read, and upside-down text is most difficult. When north varies from the vertical direction (such as a tilted map orientation or a projection that distorts direction), following the graticule so that \\"horizontal\\"=East-West helps to strengthen the understanding of direction and appears better aligned. Angled text appears more graceful and professional when placed along a slight circular arc rather than straight (unless it is following an angled straight linear feature). * Spacing (character, word, or line) can aid the association of the label with long or large features, such as spreading a label to fill a country, but this comes at the expense of legibility. Most sources suggest that spacing be used sparingly, carefully, and evenly. * Overprinting: when labels cross map symbols (especially those that are of high visual weight), they will be less legible, and obscure the shape and reduce the figure-ground contrast of the underlying feature. Usually, careful positioning of labels into empty space can avoid these conflicts, but when they cannot, masking or halos can be used to hide the underlying feature, as long as they do not obstruct so much of it as to make it unrecognizable or attract attention to themselves (usually avoided by making the mask the background color rather than white). Moving the label with an attached leader line can also mitigate conflicts, although it reduces association slightly. Map symbols that are low in the visual hierarchy can often be overprinted without difficulty. Point features  This also includes area features that are too small to label inside, in which case an exterior label treats the area symbol as a point symbol. * In terms of the directional relationship between the point and the label, some positions have better association and legibility than others. Most follow the preferences of Yoeli, who based it on Imhof. The label to the upper right of the point is generally accepted as preferred, with the other corners acceptable. Directly to the left or to the right is problematic because the point and the label can run together, and centering the label above or below the point, which was acceptable to Imhof, is now generally discouraged because it can lead to association issues. * When the point symbol is next to a line or area, especially one with a visually strong symbol (such as a city along a river or the sea), association is strengthened by placing the label on the same side as the point. This is frequently violated along shorelines because the water side generally has far fewer features and labels to contend with, so placing labels in the \\"empty space\\" aids legibility. * Spacing is generally discouraged, especially on point labels broken into multiple lines. Being \\"set tight\\" helps the label look like a single object.  Line features  Often, these guidelines are also followed for area features with a very linear shape, such as wide rivers. * Labels should generally follow the direction and curvature of the line feature. Text is legible on very simple, smooth curves, but is greatly reduced when text bends around sharp corners, so it is best placed in a relatively straight segment of the line, or along a smoothed version of the line. * It is slightly preferable to place the label above the line rather than below. The most commonly stated reason is that most western languages have more ascenders than descenders, so the baseline is more of a straight line to follow the shape of the feature. * Association will be strongest if the label is placed near the midpoint of the line (or evenly spaced along the line if there are multiple copies of the label). * Character spacing is almost universally discouraged, but some cartographers find word spacing acceptable as long as the words can be easily connected by the reader. * For a long line, especially in a dense network (such as rivers and roads), labels can be repeated occasionally to avoid confusion and aid association. Too much repetition can be overwhelming.  Area (polygon) features  These guidelines also apply to clusters of points or small areas being labeled as a single feature, such as an island chain. * All else being equal, a label location near the center of the feature will maximize association. * Many, but not all, sources suggest using letter and line spacing (within reason to not damage legibility) to fill more (but not all) of the area will aid association. * Some cartographers prefer All caps for area symbols, claiming that capital letters fill more space. * Placing the label completely inside the area is preferable, although it can be placed completely outside if the area is very small. Having a label cross the area boundary reduced its figure- ground contrast and its feature association, although if absolutely necessary, aligning the label so that it starts inside and crosses the boundary once to the outside is preferable to a centered label that crosses the boundary on both sides. * For areas with an extended shape (which Imhof calls \\"ribbon- like\\"), such as reservoirs, their labels will have stronger association if they are oriented (with a slight curve) along the main axis of the shape. Digital text management The software that is commonly used to create maps, including both geographic information systems and graphic design programs, provide a number of options for creating, editing, and storing the hundreds or even thousands of labels in a map. Each of these has advantages and disadvantages for particular situations.  Automatic label placement  Manually placing a large number of labels is a very time consuming process, even in modern software; this is especially problematic in Web mapping, where millions of maps are generated every day with no direct input from a cartographer on label placement.Been, K., Daiches, E., Yap, C., Dynamic Map Labeling, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, Vol. 12, No.5, 2006 Starting in the 1970s, the need for automation was recognized. Yoeli (1972) recognized that many of the placement guidelines espoused by Imhof (1962) and others had an algorithmic or mathematical character to them, which he attempted to specify in preparation for future placement algorithms. Since then, increasingly robust algorithms have been developed, and existing computational algorithms (such as Simulated annealing) have been adapted to the labeling problem.Introduction to automatic label placement, IBM ILOG JViews Enterprise V8.7 Help. Accessed 18 September 2012 Today, automated label placement tools are widespread, and is found in software as varied as GI, batch map renderers such as Mapnik, and javascript mapping libraries. That said, because map labelling involves subjective judgments as well as rules or guidelines, most algorithms produce rules that are sub-optimal, especially in complex maps.Kakoulis, Konstantinos G., Ioannis G. Tollis (2013) \\"Labeling Algorithms,\\" Chapter 15 in R. Tamassia, ed., Handbook of Graph Drawing and Visualization, CRC Press, pp.489-515. When possible, cartographers generally use automated labels as a starting point, then refine them.  Stored annotation  The other option is to store the location and style of each label in the map data, just like the rest of the map; this is typically called annotation.GIS Dictionary, 'Annotation'. Accessed 1 October 2016 Text can be modeled as a Geometric primitive, like points, lines, and polygons, and in graphics software, it is stored in the map document in the same way as other geometry, allowing for manual editing of content, position, and style. Many GIS platforms also have this option, but some have the additional option of storing text as a dataset, enabling the same annotation to be reused in multiple maps.esri, Annotation, ArcGIS Pro Documentation, accessed 17 August 2020 See also * Toponymy * Typography * Cartographic design References Category:Cartography Category:Infographics ","title":"Typography (cartography)"},{"id":"64988469","text":"Andhirikan (English: darkness) is a 2020 Maldivian romantic drama film directed by Ali Seezan.

In 2019, he reported against Folksam, Swedish government agencies, Jens Henriksson, Swedbank, and relevant government officials for plotting a money- laundering scheme of $150 billion. Carlstrom claimed that Folksam, government officials, and Swedbank infiltrated the largest international scheme for money laundering in history. In 2019, Carlstrom filed a lawsuit of $4.2 billion for RICO Act crimes before a court in the Southern District of New York City. He faced multiple investigation trials after the accusation. The accused government agencies, Folksam, and Swedbank‚Äôs CEO defended the lawsuit by hiring international law firms. Investigations disclosed that Swedbank had inadequate controls and systems against economic sanctions risk and money laundering. Employees at Swedbank Estonia disregarded and overlooked the factors that indicated money laundering transactions. Swedbank was also fined 4 billion SEK for shortcomings in controls and measures against money laundering. In 2019, Swedbank was alleged to carry out transactions of $4.3 billion from Danske Bank between 2007-2015.

The conflict between the Franciscans and the diocesan clergy started with the restoration of the regular church hierarchy in Bosnia and Herzegovina after its occupation by Austria-Hungary in 1881. The Herzegovina Case presents a problem in the relationship between the Herzegovinian clergy, as well as the Catholic faithful.  History = Bishops Pa≈°kal Buconjiƒá and Alojzije Mi≈°iƒá  In 1846, the Holy See established the Apostolic Vicariate of Herzegovina, which was then part of the Ottoman Empire and it was considered to be a mission area. The first vicars were all Franciscans, including Fr. Rafo Bari≈°iƒá, fr. Anƒëeo Kraljeviƒá and fr. Pa≈°kal Buconjiƒá. The Franciscans of Herzegovina were on bad terms with Apostolic Vicar for Herzegovina, Bishop Anƒëeo Kraljeviƒá, claiming he didn't give them enough of the collected alms for the construction of the monastery in Humac. The conflict between the bishop and the Franciscans reached its peak during Buconjiƒá's tenure. The reason for that was that Franciscans controlled all of the parishes in Herzegovina, while the bishop, even though a Franciscan himself, wanted to have diocesan clergy at his disposal. An aninomous letter was sent to Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria- Hungary, claiming the bishop is giving donations sent to him by Austria- Hungary to the Ottomans and accused him of being a turkophile. The Franciscan Custody barred itself from this letter. In February 1877, Kraljeviƒá requested from the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples to send an apostolic visitor in Herzegovina and accused Buconjiƒá of negligence towards the parishes and the Herzegovinian Franciscans of taking the payment for maintenance by force from the believers during the Easter Communion. The Congregation named Bishop Casimir Forlani the apostolic visitor, and he arrived in Mostar in February the next year. Forlani finished the report in May 1878, and advised Bishop to act in agreement with the Franciscans and to record revenues and expenditures, as well as to help the construction of the monastery in Humac. The question of the parishes remained unresolved. Both Fr. Rafo and Fr. Anƒëeo requested from Pope to introduce secular clergy in Herzegovina, which was finally approved after the fall of the Ottoman Empire in the region, and in 1881 the Apostolic Vicariate was elevated to the Diocese of Mostar-Duvno. After the Diocese was established, Fr. Pa≈°kal was appointed its bishop. One of his first tasks as a bishop was to make a list of parishes that are to be handed to the diocesan clergy for pastoral care, as dictated by the canon law of the Church. After 18 years, in 1899, Bishop Pa≈°kal agreed on the redistribution of parishes with the Provincial of the Franciscan Province of Herzegovina Fr. Luka Begiƒá, and submitted the list to the Holy See. Buconjiƒá postponed this issue as far as he could, even though the papal bull Ex hac augusta ended all the privileges the Franciscans enjoyed in their missionary work, they still wanted to retain all of the parishes in the diocese. The question was discussed from 1881 till until 17 July 1899, when Pope Leo XIII confirmed the Decisia, by which 14 parishes were designated to the diocesan clergy, while others were left to the Franciscans. Bishop Buconjiƒá published the Decisia only in 1908. At the beginning of this publication it was written: \\"We considered it adequate to present before the eyes of the priests of our dioceses, and especially to the young ones, the copies of the solemn Decisia in relation to the parishes established or those ought to be established. This Decisia must remain solid and constant to avoid any dissent or changeability of wishes\\". He asked the Pope for permission to trust certain dioceses to the Franciscans, as he lacked the diocesan priests. With time, however, the Deceisa remained neither solid nor constant, and \\"the dissent and changeability of wishes\\" weren't avoided. The will of bishop Buconjiƒá about the division of the parishes wasn't respected. During his 30-year episcopate, five diocesan priests in the Diocese of Mostar-Duvno were ordained, compared to the 74 Franciscans who were priestly ordained. The first major conflict between the Franciscans and the Diocese occurred in 1917, after the establishment of the Parish of ƒåapljina. ƒåapljina was supposed to be handed to the diocesan clergy, but the new Bishop Alojzije Mi≈°iƒá, who was also Franciscan, didn't enacted the transfer.  Bishop Petar ƒåule  The Contract on the Parish of ƒåapljina was signed only in 1969 between another Bishop Petar ƒåule and Privincial Fr. Rufin ≈†iƒçiƒá. However, this contract wasn't enacted either due to the opposition form the parishioners in ƒåapljina. In 1968, the parishioners expelled Archbishop of Zagreb Franjo Kuhariƒá and Bishop Petar ƒåule from ≈†iroki Brijeg, and a diocesan priest in Grude was expelled in a trunk of a car. In 1975, the Holy See issued a new decree Romanis Pontificibus regarding the redistribution of parishes. According to Romanis Pontificibus, one half of parishes would be controlled by the Franciscans and the other half by the diocesan clergy. The Franciscans opposed the decree, claiming it wasn't written nor signed by the Pope. On 10 July 1976, the Franciscan Province of Herzegovina wrote to the Pope that they \\"cannot take the responsibility for the consequences that would follow after their acceptance of the decree\\". The fierce opposition against the enforcement of Romanis Pontificibus from the Franciscans stalled the enactment of the decree until 1996.  Bishop Ratko Periƒá  On 2 April 1995, Bishop Ratko, along with his secretary, was abducted by an angry mob and held in a car in front of a Franciscan monastery for eight hours. The abduction was retaliation for Periƒá's intention to replace the Franciscans with diocesan priests in several parishes as well because of his criticism of the unconfirmed apparitions of Mary, mother of Jesus in Medjugorje. He was released only after the intervention from the Mayor of Mostar and UNPROFOR. The first serious attempt to enforce Romanis Pontificibus was made by another Bishop Ratko Periƒá on 12 May 1996. Several parishes were transferred to the diocesan clergy, but the transfer of clergy in ƒåapljina caused a disturbance. The entry of the diocesan clergy in ƒåapljina was phisically disrupted, and the doors of the church were walled up. Three Franciscans that remained in ƒåapljina, despite the Pope's decree, were expelled from the Franciscan Order and their priestly jurisdiction was revoked in 1998.

Often regarded as one of the best Botswana goalkeepers of all time, he played for several teams including Township Rollers, where he became one of their longest serving players, BMC and Mahalapye United Hotpurs. Motang began his career with Township Rollers as a twenty year old in 1987. Staying twelve years with the Gaborone-based outfit, in which he became one of their longest serving players, Motang won two league titles and three FA Cups. He then moved to Lobatse-based BMC, helping them gain promotion to the top flight in his last season. He joined Mahalapye United Hotspurs in 2004 as a player-manager and finally retired from playing altogether in 2006. Early life Motang was born in the Borolong area of Goodhope but was raised up in Selebi-Phikwe. He began playing football at primary school, functioning primarily as a defensive midfielder. After a game in which Mmoloki Sechele scored from the centre line Motang angrily took over as goalkeeper and never relinquished the role. Club career=Township Rollers Motang debuted for Rollers in 1987 aged 20. Although Rollers at the time had experienced goalkeepers like Sam Sono, Kabelo Otukile and Mchuu Manyelela, Motang quickly asserted himself as the number one choice. He stayed twelve years at the club, outlasting younger keepers such as Lesego Moeng and becoming a firm fan favourite. Botswana Meat Commission In 1999 Motang moved to BMC, then plying their trade in the second division of Botswana football. Although he played a starring role in helping the team earn promotion to the top league twice, he eventually subsided and became a backup for Reuben Mosweu. Mahalapye United Hotspurs After announcing his professional retirement in 2004 Motang resurfaced at Mahalpye-based Hotspurs as a player-manager. Primarily the coach, he was also the third-choice goalkeeper and goalkeeper coach. He officially retired from active playing in 2006 and took over full-time as the goalkeeper coach. International career Motang first came to prominence in 1984 while still playing secondary school football. He was selected for various youth tournaments which he played with Botswana U20. He made his senior debut in a 2-1 win against Zambia in 1988. During his playing career Botswana never qualified for any major tournaments. He was criticised by fans in 1992 after seemingly blaming his teammate Mooketsi Mading for a 6-0 defeat against Ivory Coast. Managerial career Motang began coaching while playing for Mahalapye United Hotspurs from 2004 to 2006. In 2006 he took over full-time as the goalkeeper coach. Two years later he moved to his former club Township Rollers and was soon applauded as the best goalkeeper coach in Botswana after contributing significantly to the development of Kabelo Dambe. In 2014, after helping Rollers win two league titles and a cup, Motang landed in hot water after taking the club to court over unpaid wages, leading to him being given an unpaid suspension. Eventually the two parted ways, with Motang being appointed Extension Gunners assistant manager, though he acted as the manager following the departure of Odirile Matlhaku. Motang stayed with the Peleng giants for only one season before joining Gaborone United ahead of the 2015-16 season. However, in January of the same season he returned to Townhip Rollers as goalkeeper coach and joint assistant manager. He remains in that post to this day.

The basic concept of the junction is that traffic must take turns to go through the junction. Filter in turns take different forms across the island. Due to a signage change in Jersey, both countries now use the same sign to indicate a filter in turn.  Jersey  In Jersey, there are five filter in turns. The first is a roundabout in Beaumont where traffic must take turns to move round the roundabout rather than the regular system of give way to the right. Three of the junctions are on the St Helier ring road and were introduced in 2012. They are effectively merge in turn junctions at various gyratories on the system. They were introduced to improve road safety. The final filter in turn is located at the end of Victoria Avenue. Traffic in both lanes where the dual carriageway reduces to a single carriageway must take it in turns to merge into the new lane in conditions of heavy traffic. These are accompanied by signs telling road users to use both lanes. This system exists to prevent the build-up of traffic during peak traffic times.  Guernsey  In Guernsey, filter in turns are more common than in Jersey and are used in a variety of road situations. This is because unlike Jersey, Guernsey has no road classification system, and traffic speeds tend to be lower, so roads more often have equal priority. Guernsey often uses box junctions at filter in turns to ensure traffic filtering does not block other traffic at peak times. Unlike in Jersey, filter in turns have painted FILTER markings on the road.

It uses an air hose to supply air from outside the danger zone. It is similar to a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), except that SCBA users carry their air with them in tanks, while SAR users get it from a stationary air supply attached to them by a hose.  Description  SARs are lightweight, but tether the user. Unlike SCBAs, the worker will not run out of air when the tank they carry is empty. They can therefore be used for longer continuous work periods. The mask end of a SAR is generally lower-maintenance than an SCBA, but the air compressors or tanks at the other end of the hose require monitoring and maintenance. It is important that they deliver good air; contaminants (which may also be introduced by faulty operation of the machinery) can be dangerous. If the air-supply line is cut or pinched shut, the user will not have any air to breathe. SAR users therefore often carry a small backup air tank (called an auxiliary escape cylinder). In an emergency, they can switch to using this supply, which should last long enough for them to escape the dangerous area. This backup bottle is required in some jurisdictions. Other regulations also apply. Users of SARs must generally be given hands-on training with the specific model they are to use. SARs may be either constant-flow or pressure-demand respirators. Constant-flow respirators supply a steady stream of air, some of which escapes from the wearer end unbreathed. Pressure-demand respirators supply air only when the pressure in the wearer's mask drops (that is, when they inhale). This saves air but allows more inwards leakage. Pressure-demand respirators can only be used with a sealed elastomeric mask, not with a loose-fitting hood (like those used in powered air-purifying respirators) or helmet (used in construction). Hoods may be made of Tyvek, polyethylene, or polypropylene.  Use  According to the NIOSH Respirator Selection Logic, SARs with an auxiliary SCBA are recommended for oxygen-deficient atmospheres, atmospheres that are immediately dangerous to life or health, and unknown atmospheres, all of which are conditions that air-purifying respirators such as N95 masks do not protect against. SARs without an auxiliary SCBA may also be used in conditions where an air-purifying respirator may be used, and have the benefit of a higher range of assigned protection factors (APF). Air-purifying respirators have APFs in the range 5‚Äì50 while SARs are in the range 25‚Äì2000, and full-facepiece pressure-demand SARs with an auxiliary pressure-demand SCBA have an APF of 10,000. For substances hazardous to the eyes, a respirator equipped with a full facepiece, helmet, or hood is recommended. SARs are not effective during firefighting, for which a SCBA is recommended instead.

History =Creation and decade of 1980s Norbert Gleicher, an obstetrician-gynecologist born in Krak√≥w, moved to the United States to complete his fellowship in immunology in New York City and to develop his residency in obstetrics and gynecology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Chicago. After holding positions as assistant professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and division director of the division of Reproductive Immunology at the medical center, he founded the Center for Human Reproduction in Chicago in 1981, established as the first IVF center in the Midwest. In 1983, the center performed worlds's first transvaginal egg retrieval. Five years later a manuscript was published reporting the world's first transvaginal tubal catheterization to open occluded fallopian tubes. 1990's: New York City opening With the growth of the center in Chicago, a new headquarters was opened in New York City. In 1997, the center reached an agreement with Columbia University to staff CHR NY as university's IVF program. One year later, CHR NY opened at 635 Madison Avenue including in its staff the american physician Mark V. Sauer, who was then Head of the Reproductive Endocrinology Division at Columbia. Sauer became the center's Medical Director and Dr. Andrea Vidali, also from Columbia University's division of reproductive endocrinology, was included in CHR's team of professionals. By the end of 1999, Gleicher was in charge of both centers in Chicago and New York City, splitting his time each week between the two cities. New millenium and present In 2000, 21 E 69th Street location was purchased as the new site of CHR in New York City. This location was opened on September 10, 2001, the night before the September 11 attacks. In 2003 Gleicher sold the Chicago operations to Reproductive Genetics Institute with a one-year transition period, and moved full-time back to New York City. That same year, David H. Barad, MD, MS, previously Head of Reproductive Endocrinology/IVF Division at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, joined the center as Clinical Director of Assisted Reproductive Technologies. With the inclusion of Barad, the center's research focus on ovarian aging tightened. In 2005, CHR published the first manuscript on the use of DHEA supplementation for female fertility in Fertility & Sterility international journal. CHR published in 2008 the first manuscript about the danger of preimplantation genetic screening after performing some analyses that proved the low effectiveness of this procedure in improving the chances of pregnancy in IVF. Around 2010, the center started a research collaboration with Aritro Sen, PhD's laboratory at University of Rochester Medical Center. This collaboration resulted in several publications related to the crucial roles androgens play in female fertility. Three years later, the center published the first report of IVF success rate manipulation, leading to CDC and SART to update report guidelines to close a loophole. In 2015 CHR established \\"What's My Fertility\\", an online risk screening tool for young women to detect risk of developing premature ovarian aging (POA) and associated infertility later in life. In 2017, the center reported the oldest pregnancy and live birth in an almost 48 year old woman, after an IVF procedure with her own eggs. In 2018 and 2019, CHR website won the eHealthcare Leadership Award in Best Healthcare Content, in Medical Practice/Outpatient Facility category. During the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City in 2020, the center remained open for urgent fertility treatments.  References External links *Norbert Gleicher on LinkedIn.

The scandal came to light when $122 million (US) was invested into Bahamian bank accounts without the board members' approval. The scandal resulted in Canada's longest criminal trial ever brought before a jury. In 2004, following the scandal, Cinar was sold to a group led by Nelvana founder Michael Hirsh, and former Nelvana president Toper Taylor for $190 million. The company was subsequently renamed Cookie Jar. Background Cinar was founded by the husband and wife team of Micheline Charest and Ronald Weinberg in 1976 in New York City after organizing an event for a women's film festival, and later moved its operations to Montreal. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the company saw massive success with children's programming such as Papa Beaver's Storytime, The Busy World of Richard Scarry, Nickelodeon's Are You Afraid of the Dark? and The Adventures of Paddington Bear. And perhaps its most famous works are Caillou and Arthur. Cinar went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1993, and then on the Nasdaq one year later. By 1999, Cinar boasted annual revenues of $150 million (CAD) and owned about $1.5 billion (CAD) of the children's television market. In 1996, Cinar acquired the library of the British animation studio FilmFair - which includes television adaptations of Paddington Bear, and closed it in 1998. In February 1999, Cinar acquired the film library of Leucadia Film Corporation. The company collapsed in 2000, when an internal audit revealed $122 million (US) was invested into Bahamian bank accounts without the board members' approval. Cinar had also paid American screenwriters for work while continuing to accept federal grants and tax credits for the production of domestic content, although the names of Canadian citizens (generally non- writers connected to Cinar, including Charest's sister Helene) were credited for their work. While criminal charges were not filed, Cinar denied any wrongdoing, choosing instead to pay a settlement to Canadian and Quebec tax authorities of $17.8 million (CAD) and another $2.6 million (CAD) to Telefilm Canada, a Canadian federal funding agency. The value of Cinar's stock plummeted, and the company was soon delisted. There was some speculation that Cinar's CFO Hasanain Panju was the mastermind behind the investment scheme. Other individuals believed to have helped with the scheme include John Xanthoudakis of Norshield Investment Group and Lino Matteo of Mount Real Corporation. It was alleged that Charest and Weinberg (and later Panju) used Cinar as a personal 'piggy bank' and schemed to transfer funds out from the company to the Bahamas through a series of complicated transactions to their own offshore holding companies. In 2001, Charest and Weinberg agreed to pay $1 million each, and were fired from the company's board of directors. On August 26, 2009, in a separate case, the Superior Court of Quebec ruled that Cinar had plagiarized the work of Claude Robinson for its animated series Robinson Sucroe. The series was based on a concept he had pitched to Cinar in 1986, but had been turned down. Robinson was awarded $5.2 million in damages, in a suit that resolved a 14-year dispute between the two parties. In 2014, Panju pleaded guilty to undisclosed crimes, and was sentenced to four years in prison. The judge noted these crimes were \\"disgraceful\\" and placed a publication ban on details surrounding the trial. Two years later, Weinberg, Xanthoudakis, and Matteo, were each sentenced to 9 years in prison for their involvement. Charest never lived to see an outcome, as she died of complications from plastic surgery in 2004. In 2019, Weinberg was paroled.

Climate The climate of the ecoregion is tropical and humid. The mountains intercept prevailing winds from the Pacific, creating clouds, fog, and orographic precipitation. The forests have a cooler and wetter climate than the adjacent lowlands. Average annual temperatures decrease with elevation. Flora The main plant community is montane tropical broadleaf evergreen forest. Fauna The ecoregion has over 300 species of birds. It is a center of endemism for salamanders and butterflies. Human impacts Much of the ecoregion's forest has been cleared for agriculture and grazing. Much of the remaining forest area is fragmented or degraded.

It connects the May 3 Constitution Park with the Poniatowski Park. History In the 18th century, the area of the present Planty was occupied by the Branicki Fallow Fallow deer. In 1837 it was handed over to the Institute of Noble Maidens based in the palace. Until the end of the 19th century, orchards and meadows were located there, from which hay was obtained for the needs of the horse tram depot. The area became increasingly neglected over time, and after 1919 it was left without a farmer or care. Initially, the park was fenced with a wooden fence, and in the years 1908-1910 with a metal fence with three decorative gates, designed by Engineer Ko≈Çuby. This fence lasted until 1934. During the great economic crisis in 1932, on the initiative of the voivode of Bia≈Çystok Voivodeship, Marian Zyndram-Ko≈õcio≈Çkowski who donated 28 hectares of state-owned land to the city, the design of a city park called Planty was started. This area is located between the present streets: Mickiewicza, ≈öwiƒôtoja≈Ñska, Akademicka and Legionowa. The author and implementer of the project was Stanis≈Çaw Grall who from 1934 head of the Municipal Plantations department, with whom J√≥zef Blicharski then collaborated on their establishment. In line with the modernist design, pedestrian alleys began to be created rapidly in 1934. It has a rich and varied green cover, separated by an irregular network of roads and alleys. One of the two fountains provided in the contract between the city and the waterworks and a restaurant pavilion were built in the park.Informator Bialystocki - Park Planty In the eastern part of the park, there is a rose with a regular layout of quarters, arranged on 4 levels. On the lowest level, a rectangular pool was built, next to which, before 1938, a sculpture of the \\"Washermen\\" by Stanis≈Çaw Horno-Pop≈Çawski was erected in 1945. Within two years, leveling works were carried out, new alleys were marked out, about 600 trees of 34 species were planted, original lanterns and cast-iron benches were installed. In 1951, a monument of gratitude to the Red Army was erected on the main axis of the alley, which in 1990 was moved to the Cemetery for Soviet soldiers at Cio≈Çkowskiego Street. In the park there is also a sculpture by Ma≈Çgorzata Niedzielko, \\"Kawelin Dog\\". Overview The City Park is a compilation of a geometric French style and a free, natural landscape layout. A wide promenade with floral carpet floors runs through the park. In the center there is a rectangular pool with a fountain. At Mickiewicza Street vis a vis the Tax Chamber and the Female Gymnasium Anna Jab≈Çonowska n√©e Sapieha, a rose garden was created. These are tunnels made of climbing roses, rows of box trees, gates overgrown with plants - places that arouse the admiration of the city residents and visitors. The most valuable trees in the park are: English oaks (Quercus robur), hornbeams (Carpinus betulus), Norway maples (Acer platanoides), pines, Norway spruces (Picea abies), and warty birches (Betula pendula). Elder bushes (Sambucus) and rose hips (Rosa canina) can be distinguished. In the park there are common squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris), woodpeckers (Picidae), House sparrows (Passer domescitus), and great tit (Parus major).

The dark beige area shows residential and commercial areas; the light beige areas are caravan parks; the parish boundary shown as a dashed red line. Skegness ( ) is a seaside town and civil parish in Lincolnshire, England. On the Lincolnshire coast of the North Sea, the town is east of Lincoln and 22 miles north-east of Boston. With a population of 19,579, it is the largest settlement in the East Lindsey district; it also incorporates Winthorpe (previously its own parish) and Seacroft, and forms a larger built-up area with the resorts of Ingoldmells and Chapel St Leonards to the north. Historically Skegness was situated further east and at the mouth of The Wash; it was later named for the headland which likely sat near the settlement. There is evidence of late Iron-Age and early Roman saltmaking activity in the area and the settlement may have been associated with a Roman fort and ferry crossing to Norfolk. The modern name is Old Norse and appears in the historical record from the 12th century. By the 14th century, Skegness was a locally important port for coastal trade. The natural sea defences which protected the harbour eroded in the later Middle Ages, and it was lost to the sea after a storm in the 1520s. Rebuilt along the new shoreline, early modern Skegness was a small fishing and farming village, but from the late 18th century members of the local gentry visited for holidays. The arrival of the railways in 1873 transformed it into a popular seaside resort. This was the intention of the landowner, the 9th Earl of Scarbrough, who wished to capitalise on the growing trend for seaside holidaying, increasingly affordable among the working population. He built the infrastructure of the town and laid out plots, which he leased to speculative developers. This new Skegness quickly became a popular destination for holiday-makers and day trippers from the East Midlands factory towns. A drop in trade in the 1880s was soon replaced by a boom; by the interwar years the town was established as one of the most popular seaside resorts in Britain. The layout of the modern seafront dates to this time and holiday camps were built around the town, including the first Butlin's holiday resort which opened in Ingoldmells in 1936. The arrival of package holidays abroad in the 1970s and the decline in industrial employment in the East Midlands harmed Skegness's trade in the late 20th century, but it retains a loyal visitor base and has increasingly attracted people visiting for a second holiday. The late-20th-century trend for self-catered holidays has also led to rapid growth in the number of static caravan parks around the town and some people chose to occupy these for most of the year. As a consequence, many guesthouses and hotels in the town have closed since the Second World War and the seafront has become more commercialised. Owing to the resort's affordability, tourism increased following the Great Recession. In 2011, the town was the United Kingdom's fourth most popular tourist destination and in 2015 it received over 1.4 million visitors.  Early history = Prehistoric and early medieval  There is evidence of late Iron-Age and early Roman saltmaking activity along the part of the Lincolnshire coast which Skegness now occupies.Kime (1986), p. 13. For further discussion about this industry, see Lane and Morris (2001). There are medieval references to a \\"Chester Land\\" and \\"Castelland\\" at Skegness and the antiquary John Leland was informed in 1543 that a castle had existed at Skegness before being lost to the sea in c. 1526; this has been interpreted as tentative evidence that there was a Roman fort at the site.Owen and Coates (2003), p. 43. The archaeologist Charles Phillips suggested that Skegness was the terminus of a Roman road running from Lincoln through Burgh le Marsh and was also the location of a Roman ferry which crossed The Wash to Norfolk.Phillips (1932). This theory is now \\"generally accepted\\". It is likely that the Anglo-Saxons used these Roman fortifications as one of several defensive positions along the coast. Later, the Vikings settled in Lincolnshire and their influence is detected in many local place names.Kime (1986), p. 13. Skegness's name combines the Old Norse words Skeggi and ness, and means either \\"Skeggi's headland\\" or \\"beard-shaped headland\\" (possibly referring to the banks at an angle to the coast);Cameron and Ingsley (1998), p. 110. Skeggi (meaning \\"bearded one\\") may be the name of a Viking settler or it could derive from the Old Norse word skegg \\"beard\\" and have been used to describe the shape of the landform.Mills (2011) gives both possibilities. Skegness was not named in the Domesday Book of 1086. It is usually identified with the Domesday settlement called Tric.Owen and Coates (2003), p. 42. The historian Arthur Owen and the linguist Richard Coates have argued that Tric derived its name from Traiectus, Latin for \\"crossing\\", referring to the Roman ferry that Phillips argues launched from Skegness.Owen and Coates (2003), pp. 42‚Äì44. In Domesday there are four entries for Tric: Alan of Brittany had an estate there which was sokeland of his manor of Drayton; Eudo of Tattershall had two estates there, sokeland of his manors of Burgh Le Marsh and Addlethorpe respectively; and Robert Despenser had sokeland belonging to his manor of \\"Guldelsmere\\" which is normally identified with Ingoldmells. Tric is not otherwise recorded; the name Skegness appears in the 12th century,Mills (1998). and further references are known from the 13th.Bower (1940), p. 174. In the Middle Ages, the township and the majority of the parish fell under the jurisdiction of the manor of Ingoldmells, which also covered parts of Addlethorpe, Burgh le Marsh, Great Steeping and Partney.Massingberd (1902), pp. xiv‚Äìxv. This was Despencer's Domesday estate. It passed to his brother Urse d'Abetot on his death probably in the late 1090s; Urse exchanged them with Robert de Lacy, lord of Pontefract.Mason (2009), p. 84.Massingberd (1902), pp. ix‚Äìxi. With the exception of a period of forfeiture in the 12th century, the manor descended with the Honour of Pontefract through the de Lacy family until it was inherited in 1348 by Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster (died 1360); it passed to John of Gaunt (died 1399), the husband of the duke's daughter and eventual sole heiress Blanche, and then to their son Henry of Bolingbroke, who became Henry IV, after which the lordship of the manor merged in the crown. According to the local historian W. O. Massingberd, there was no manor of Skegness, the \\"greater part\\" being under Ingoldmell's jurisdiction (including the banks, dykes, port and shore), though the Bishop of Lincoln had a small manor there and some land was held in the parish of the manor of Croft.Massingberd (1902), pp. xiv. In 1483, William Waynflete founded a grammar school (Magdalen College School) in Wainfleet for boys.Kime (1986), p. 79.  Medieval harbour  As a coastal settlement, Skegness benefited from natural sea defences. Behind barrier shoals, dunes and beaches, a natural headland and cape allowed for the establishment of a harbour.Pawley (1984), pp. 79‚Äì80. It is unlikely but impossible to know whether there was continuity between the Domesday vill of Tric and this later settlement; the geographer Ian Simmons has speculated that the later settlement may stem from an attempt by the local lord to replicate Wainfleet's success as a port in the 12th and 13th centuries.Simmons (n.d.), s. 2.2.7. The harbour at Skegness was relatively small and its trade in the 14th century was likely more coastal than international;Pawley (1984), p. 127. it was \\"thriving\\" in that century but its economic fortunes were probably closely related to those of nearby coastal ports, such as Wainfleet, which in turn depended on the larger port at Boston which was heavily involved in the wool trade.Pawley (1984), p. 148. It was also an important port for Lincolnshire fishermen.Pawley (1984), pp. 182, 190. In the 15th century Skegness imported timber and other wares from Scandinavia;Kime (1986), p. 15. there were also instances of piracy off the coast.Pawley (1984), pp. 36, 38. During the medieval period the destruction of offshore islands led to silt being deposited along the Lincolnshire coast; as salt-working and drainage intensified, this combined to leave the coast in a constant state of change.Pawley (1984), p. 76. The later medieval period brought frequent storms, which eroded Skegness's sea defences. The manorial court records instances of illegal grazing on the sandbanks which would have contributed to erosion.Simmons (n.d.), s. 2.2.1.4. Between the 14th and 16th centuries, Skegness was one of several coastal settlements to incur major loss of land to the sea. Local people attempted to make artificial banks, but they were costly.Pawley (1984), p. 79. Rising sea levels from the later medieval period further threatened the coast. In 1525 or 1526 Skegness was largely washed away in a storm, along with the hamlets of East and West Meales and the headland which gave Skegness its name.Pawley (1984), pp. 80‚Äì81.Kime (1986), p. 84.

Retrieved 13 May 2020. By 1543, when the antiquarian John Leland visited the town, some of the old buildings were still visible at low tide, but he noted that \\"For old Skegnes is now buildid a pore new thing\\". Over the course of the sixteenth century, the sea continued to encroach into the land at Skegness, while depositing sand banks further south, likely leading to the creation of Gibraltar Point.Pawley (1984), pp. 81‚Äì83. A 1560 inquest called for new sea banks to be built, construction of which began in 1568, were likely interrupted by the \\"Great Flood\\" of 1571 and were still not finished by 1574.Simmons (n.d.), s. 2.2.4.4. Ships are recorded unloading their wares at Skegness the following century.Kime (1986), pp. 14‚Äì17. Skegness was principally a small farming and fishing village throughout the early modern period.\\"Settlement of Skegness (HER no. 45510)\\", Heritage Gateway (Historic England). Retrieved 13 May 2020. Much of the land appears to have come into the hands of the Hiltoft family, from whom it passed to Nicholas Saunderson, 1st Viscount Castleton following his marriage (in 1584) to Mildred, heiress of John Hiltoft of Boston.Kime (1986), p. 14.Watson and Sgroi (2010). Castleton enclosed 400 acres of saltmarsh in 1627; the formation of Gibraltar Point led to more land being reclaimed from the sea south of Skegness by Croft Marsh, and successive Lords Castleton were engaged in long disputes and legal claims over the ownership of the new lands, eventually acquiring land by the sea in 1681. The whole estate passed through the male line which became extinct in 1723 on the death of the 5th Viscount, who bequeathed his estate to his cousin Thomas Lumley; in 1740 Lumley became 3rd Earl of Scarbrough. By 1845, the Scarbrough estate comprised 1,219 acres at Skegness.Sedgwick (1970). The Lincolnshire marshland running alongside the coast from Wainfleet up to the Humber provided good pasture for sheep and cattle, especially in the silty, flat Outmarsh closest to the shore. The area around Skegness was no exception and was used for grazing. In the early 17th century, farmers on the Wolds drove their sheep to the Skegness Outmarsh for summer fattening. Reclaiming marsh land and developing dykes naturally meant enclosing it, which was often a piecemeal process.Thirsk (1957), p. 68. The Lords Castleton had enclosed a large portion of the lands around Skegness by 1740,Kime (1986), p. 17. over 800 acres. In the early 19th century, the pastures benefited from their proximity to markets and good soil, but lacked shelter and hedgerows along the wide dykes. The population sat at 134 in 1801; this had risen to a modern peak of 366 by the time of the 1851 census but dropped slightly over the following twenty years.Hewson (1986), p. 63. Skegness's first elementary school was established in 1839 on the west side of Roman Bank; despite being enlarged in 1850, the standard of education and facilities were regarded as poor by inspectors. Winthorpe's children were given lessons in the church from 1823 and in the parish clerk's cottage from 1840, but the village did not get a schoolhouse until 1865.Kime (1986), p. 77. As late as the early 1870s, Skegness \\"was still very much an undeveloped village of fishermen, farmers and farm hands\\".Gurnham (1972), p. 64.  Development of the seaside resort = Before the railways  While most of those living in Skegness worked in agriculture or fishing, local gentry began visiting the village for leisure reasons from the late 18th century. The sea air was thought to have health-giving qualities.Kime (1986), p. 19. To capitalise on this trend, the Skegness Hotel (later Enderby's and by 1851 renamed the Vine Hotel) opened in 1770; visitors could reach it by omnibus from Boston, which was the terminus of several stagecoaches.Stennett (2016), p. 116. The first reference to bathing machines on Skegness's shores dates to 1784 though they are thought to have been present earlier. Private houses also opened their doors to lodgers, including Moat House (built by Rev. Edward Walls in c. 1780), and by 1813 another hotel had opened: the New Hotel, later named Hildred's after its Victorian landlords.Kime (1986), pp. 19‚Äì21. It was joined in the 1830s by The Ship.Kime (1986), p. 47. The diarist John Byng paid a visit in the late 18th century and, although pleased with the clear air, he was unimpressed by the Skegness Hotel and its landlord. The local gentry frequented Skegness, with the Massingberds known to visit The Vine in the early 19th century. Born and raised at Somersby, the poet Alfred Tennyson (later Lord Tennyson) holidayed at Skegness as a young man, often taking walks along the shore from his lodgings at Mary Walls' Moat House on the sea bank; some scholars have drawn parallels between his poetry and the landscape he encountered on these visits.\\"Between the Ears: Tennyson in Skegness\\", BBC Radio 3, broadcast 5 June 2010. Retrieved 19 May 2020.Rawnsley (1911), p. 16. The place remained popular with visitors and another hotel, Sea View, was built in 1862. By 1872, there were also nine lodging houses.  The arrival of the railways  The railway line connecting the East Midlands cities with Skegness The East Lincolnshire Railway, running along the coast between Boston and Grimsby, opened in 1848 but ran further inland than Skegness, through Firsby, Burgh and up to Alford. There were clear benefits to building lines connecting the coastal settlements, but it was not until the late 1860s that the first moves were made. In 1868, a line was built connecting Spilsby with Firsby junction, and the following year work began on a branch from Firsby to Wainfleet All Saints, therefore bringing railways to both market towns. By the time that opened (with rolling stock operated by the Great Northern Railway), plans were tabled for the Skegness extension, which were approved in 1871 by GNR shareholders and later by Parliament.Pearson (1968), p. 284. The railways arrived at Skegness in 1873.Gurnham (1972), p. 63. From the outset, the railway to Skegness was not an agricultural venture but one designed to bring day trippers to the seaside.Kime (1986), p. 31. Rising wages and better holiday provision meant that some working-class people from the East Midlands factory towns could afford to have a holiday for the first time. As the historian T. W. Beastall wrote: \\"Here were six miles of water to which the people of Derby, Leicester and Nottingham could resort\\".Beastall (1975), p. 184. The arrival of the railway coincided with the Great Depression of British agriculture, during which time cheaper foreign goods undermined the industry. As a major landowner, Richard Lumley, 9th Earl of Scarbrough, had seen his income stagnate and assets lose value; his agent, Henry Vivian Tippet, while surveying the Skegness lands ahead of the railway's arrival, decided that the earl's fortunes might be revived if he turned Skegness into a seaside resort.Kime (1986), p. 32.  Building the resort town  Skegness Pier in the late 19th centuryBy the time the station opened the shoreline had been surveyed and the earl's land divided into lots, some of which were sold to builders in 1873. The earl stipulated that developments needed his approval and would have to be completed promptly, but it is not clear that the plots were quick to sell or always built on. A more comprehensive scheme emerged in 1876, when a road plan was developed and the earl took out a mortgage of ¬£120,000 to fund developments. In 1878, the full plan was finished by George Booth Walker. It laid out plots for 787 houses in the settlement on 96 acres of land (mostly occupied by the tenant farmer William Everington) between the shoreline and Roman Bank north of the High Street.Gurnham (1972), pp. 65‚Äì66. The new streets were to be grid-aligned, with a Grand Parade running along the shore parallel to a road along Roman Bank (now the A52); these were the eastern and western boundaries of the development. Scarbrough Avenue was laid out running inland from the centre of the Parade and was bisected by Lumley Avenue, with a new church in the roundabout. At the end of Scarbrough Avenue would be a pier. Scarbrough Avenue and Lumley Avenue were planned with wider roads than the other streets, suggesting that they were envisaged as the main throughfares.Kime (1986), pp. 32, 36. The earl spent thousands of pounds on laying roads and the sewerage system, and building the sea wall (the latter of which was finished in 1878).Gurnham (1972), p. 66.Robinson (1989), p. 156. He leased nearby brickworks in 1875 to provide a supply for builders.Gurnham (1872), p. 67. The earl created companies (of which he was the largest shareholder) to provide many other amenities, including gasworks, waterworks, Skegness Pier (opened in 1881), the pleasure gardens (finished in 1881 and taken over by the earl in 1882), the steamboats (first launched in 1882 and taken over by the earl's company in 1883) and bathing pools (1883).Gurnham (1972), pp. 66‚Äì67.The dates for the foundations of the water works, bathing pools and pier are from Kelly (1885), p. 621. The date of the steamboat enterprise is from Adamson (1977), p. 33. With the brickworks struggling to keep up with demand, he formed a company to take them over in 1882 and the following year expanded the operation. He donated land and money towards the construction of two Methodist chapels, a school, a cattle market (opened in 1880) and the cricket ground. Realising that the medieval church of St Clement's was too small and too far from the new town to be convenient, the earl donated land and ¬£3,000 towards the cost of building a replacement in the new town.\\"Church of St Matthew (List Entry No. 1230006)\\", The National Heritage List for England (Historic England). Retrieved 19 May 2020. The much larger St Matthew's Church was therefore built on Scarbrough Avenue in 1879‚Äì80, with the north aisle and chancel added before the church was consecrated in 1885; the spire which was planned was not completed due to subsidence. Further works were needed to stabilise the building through to the 1930s.Kime (1986), pp. 67‚Äì68. As part of the town plan, the old schoolhouse was closed and the site sold; money raised from the sale was combined with a donation from the earl and funding from National Society to pay for the building of the Skegness National School on Roman Bank in 1880.  1878‚Äì1945 = 1878‚Äìc. 1890: early boom and slump  The Grand Parade before the clock tower was built, looking north towards the pier. The Marine Gardens are on the right. Housebuilding was left to speculative builders, who purchased 99-year leases on the plots of land. Although the plans likely intended Scarbrough Avenue to be the centre of the new town, the earliest development was concentrated in the south along Lumley Road, which offered a direct route from the train station to the seafront; most of the plots there had been leased by 1880 and built by 1882. Newspapers across the Midlands advertised properties, and shops began opening. The market place envisaged in the early plans was never built nor were the winter gardens,Kime (1986), pp. 32‚Äì34. but the Lumley Hotel opened in 1880 followed by the Lion Hotel in 1881, by which time almost a thousand people had moved into the town;Gurnham (1972), p. 72.For the Lion opening, see Kime (1986), p. 47. of the 1,332 people recorded in the 1881 census, 91.6% had not been in the town 10 years earlier, including many young people and a diverse range of trades.Hewson (1986), pp. 63‚Äì64. According to the local historian Winston Kime, Skegness had become known as a \\"trippers paradise\\" by 1880.Kime (1986), p. 46. The August bank holiday saw 20,000 descend on the town; they came to enjoy the beach, the many games and amusements that had popped up in the town, the pleasure boat trips that had just started launching from the pier, and the donkey rides.Kime (1986), pp. 45‚Äì46. By August 1882, 368 houses had been built and boarding houses were being erected along Drummond Road, Rutland Road and Algitha Road; a freehold society was laying what became Grosvenor Road. This boom continued into 1883. Building contracted after the 1883 season.Gurnham (1972), p. 73. Few developments took place over the coming years, although the accreted sands in front of the sea wall south of the pier were converted into the Marine Gardens in 1888 to avoid them becoming unsightly. This stagnation coincided with a declining number of day-trippers, which fell from a peak of 230,277 in 1882 to 118,473 in 1885. The population contracted from the 1,934 recorded in 1882 to 1,488 in 1891. The lands north of Scarbrough Avenue went undeveloped; the earl had been unable to sell them and planted trees on the sand dunes and named it The Park, known locally as \\"The Jungle\\".Kime (1986), p. 33.

As the historian Susan Barton has written, \\"Skegness and other 'lower' status resorts provided cheap amusements, beach entertainers, street traders and, by the end of the nineteenth century, spectacular entertainment for a mass market\\".Barton (2005), p. 134. The number of annual excursions to Skegness had risen to 226,880 in 1902 and grew to 321,260 in 1907.Robinson (1989), p. 171. In 1908 the famous \\"Jolly Fisherman\\" poster was used by GNR to advertise day trips (costing 3s) from King's Cross in London. The town's largest hotel, the Seacroft Hydro (later the Seacroft Hotel), opened in 1908‚Äì09.Robinson (1989), p. 157. In 1913 more than 750,000 people made excursions to the town. Aside from bathing and enjoying the sands, visitors to Skegness found entertainment in the pier, which had a concert hall, saloon and theatre; from 1904 to 1920 the one-legged Billy Thompson dived off the end to please the crowds. On the beach, Fred Clements' concert on the dunes off North Parade was a popular attraction in the Edwardian period, allowing him to open a theatre in 1911; other theatres and picture houses opened around this time.Robinson (1989), p. 174.Kime (1986), pp. 53‚Äì54, 56, 103. Britain's first switchback had opened in the town in 1885 or 1887. A fairground operated on the central beach before the First World War, an aerial flight north of the pier by 1906, and the Figure 8 rollercoaster replaced the 1885 switchback and opened near Sea View on North Parade in 1908.Kime (1986), pp. 103‚Äì104.\\"Skegness Esplanade and Tower Gardens (Entry No. 443891\\"), The National Heritage List for England (Historic England). Retrieved 25 May 2020. The town became an urban district in 1895,Dutton (1922), p. 81. and by 1901 its population exceeded 2,000. Convalescent homes began opening in the town, the earliest being the Nottinghamshire Convalescent Home for Men (1891). Holiday homes or camps for the poor opened for Derbyshire children in 1891 and Nottingham girls in 1907.Kime (1986), pp. 49‚Äì50.Dutton (1922), p. 62. A clock tower was built to mark Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee in 1897 and was formally opened in 1899. The dunes to the north and south of Skegness made for excellent golf courses, with one opening at Seacroft in 1899.Kime (1986), pp. 47‚Äì49. Another golf links opened at North Shore in 1911. By that year, the population had reached 3,775.Pevsner, Harris and Antram (1989), p. 644. The youngest children were educated in temporary accommodation before the county council opened the Infants' School on Cavendish Road in 1908.  Early twentieth century  Aside from a seaplane base briefly established by the town in 1914, the First World War brought little change to the fabric of SkegnessKime (1986), p. 128. but the resort underwent much change between the world wars. The Urban District Council purchased the seafront east of the parade wall in 1922. The district engineer and surveyor Rowland Henry Jenkins was responsible for overhauling it, which included the construction of Tower Esplanade (1923), a paved walkway extending from the clock tower to the shore. To the south, he built the boating lake on sand dunes (1924, extended in 1932) and the Fairy Dell paddling pool. To the north, he replaced the Marine Gardens; a large part of the site was used for the Embassy Ballroom, outdoor bathing pool, restaurant and orchestral piazza which all opened in 1928. The town's first municipal car park opened that year, catering for the rapidly growing motor traffic. In 1923, the amusements on the main beach were moved to the dunes opposite The Park, but a covenant stipulated that once The Park began to be developed the amusements would need to relocate. After works began, Billy Butlin (who had been a stall holder since 1925) agreed to build permanent amusements south of the pier; these opened in 1929. Afterwards, Jenkins remodelled the foreshore north of the pier, constructing walkways, sports grounds and bowling greens which opened in 1931.Kime (1986), pp. 100‚Äì103, 109. During the 1930s, the west side of North Parade was built up with hotels. Convalescent homes were built in interwar years, including one for Derbyshire miners at Seathorne (1928).Kime (1986), p. 49.\\"Healthy Skegness\\", Boston Guardian, 27 August 1927, p. 11. Skegness's popularity as a tourist destination grew in the interwar years and boomed during the 1930s, helped by the new attractions. Swimming galas, tournaments and regattas were among the popular events at the new facilities. Elsewhere the Skegness Aero Club attracted 15,000 spectators to watch a show at the Winthorpe Airfield in 1932; that year the illuminations were turned on for the first time and the Sun Castle opened on North Parade. The following year Butlin launched a carnival, among the largest on the east coast. Cinemas and casinos joined the theatres of the Edwardian period as popular attractions. In 1936, Butlin built his own all-in holiday camp in Ingoldmells, providing constant entertainment and facilities for guests. It was joined in 1939 by The Derbyshire Miners' Holiday Camp.Strange (2007), p. 206. This growing popularity created much debate in the town over the merits of Sunday trading; in early 20th century, some residents believed that shops should close on Sundays (the Sabbath).Kime (1986), p. 50. Sunday train trips were introduced in 1904, after the GNR refused a request from the urban district council to delay train services until after church services on Sundays;Neller (2011), p. 18. the debate intensified in the 1920s, but a local referendum came out in favour of opening up caf√©s and shops on Sundays in 1927, and soon after amusements were allowed to open as well; Sunday trading was allowed universally in 1932. The debate hinged on class as much as religious divisions, with many advocates of Sunday trading restrictions being guesthouse owners who were concerned that day- tripping labourers (welcomed by traders) would disturb their higher-income guests and \\"lower the tone of the resort\\".Neller (2012), p. 37, for the quote. The interwar period also witnessed change to the residential area. Speculative housing was put up north of Scarbrough Avenue from the 1920s by T. L. Kirk and J. H. Canning, and after Castleton Boulevard was built in 1934 the original plan area was largely filled in. A hundred houses were built in the Richmond Drive area under the Housing, Town Planning, &c.; Act 1919, and private developments took place around Wainfleet Road and Lincoln Road in the 1930s.Kime (1969), pp. 69, 81.Kime (1986), p. 105. The owner of land north of the North Shore golf links laid out a housing development, the Seathorne Estate, in 1925, by which time Winthorpe Avenue was mostly built up.\\"Growing Skegness: Development of New Estate\\", Skegness Standard, 11 February 1925, p. 8.

Several private schools existed in Skegness during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During the Second World War, the Royal Air Force billeted thousands of trainees in the town for its No 11 Recruit Centre. The Butlin's camp was occupied by the Royal Navy, who called it HMS Royal Arthur and used it for training seamen. Aerial bombing of the town began in 1940; there were fatalities on several occasions, the greatest being on 24 October 1941 when twelve residents were killed during a bombing raid.Kime (1986), pp. 128‚Äì129.  Since 1945 = Tourism and the seafront  The beach at Skegness in 2006, looking north towards the pier; the Pleasure Beach amusements are on the left Since the Second World War, self-catered holidays have become popular, prompting the growth of caravan parks and chalet accommodation.Robinson (1989), p. 175. By 1981 20 caravan sites were in operation and five years later there were 12,000 holiday caravans and chalets in Skegness and Ingoldmells.Kime (1986), pp. 134‚Äì135. Much of the lodging accommodation in the town centre closed as a result, although 300 bed and breakfasts were still operating in the 1970s. By 1998, the town had lost over 3,000 of the 8,100 bed spaces it had in 1950, but had gained 15,000 caravans.Walton (2000), p. 69. The 1970s also witnessed the birth of the cheap package airline holiday abroad, which took visitors away from British seaside towns.

Nevertheless, holiday-makers continued to visit the town and in the 1980s and 1990s, people ventured to Skegness for their second holiday alongside trips abroad; it also proved popular among the elderly in the winter months. The resort's popularity grew during the late 2000s Great Recession, as it offered a cheaper alternative to holidays abroad.East Lindsey District Council (2016), p. 96.

Butlin's left the main amusement park and it was extensively refurbished in 1966; the North Parade amusements were also refitted in 1970 and the Figure 8 demolished. In 1971, the pier entrance was replaced with what David Robinson called \\"a characterless mass of glass and concrete\\" housing arcades, a bingo hall and a variety bar; in 1978, a large section was swept away in a storm.\\"Skegness\\", National Piers Society.

Once an exclusive address on the edge of town, whilst its architecture remains intact, it is functionally downgraded to a transport corridor, and is one of the busiest streets in the city centre.Grant's Old and New Edinburgh vol III History St George's Chapel in 1830 plus manse on its left 1 to 3 York Place, Edinburgh York Place was developed as a dual sided street on the north-east edge of Edinburgh's First New Town. The land was purchased by the city from James Erskine, Lord Alva and the Heriot Trust in 1793. Work began immediately and was complete by 1804 (other than the church (see below).Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh by Gifford, McWilliam and Walker The street is little altered. The only major change has been the widening of Elder Street on the south side (to improve access to the bus station) which trimmed the width of the buildings on its west side in 1969. In 1888 a tram system was introduced. Originally drawn by underground cables the system was invisible except for the rails and central channel (for the cable). This all changed in 1921 following unification of Edinburgh and Leith (which had electric trams since 1905) when a complex of poles and wires were added, to the severe detriment of the streetscape. These poles and cables were removed in 1956 following the demise of the trams. More conscious of the issue of \\"street clutter\\" the planners removed all lamp-posts from the street in the 1970s. The street is lit by high level floodlights mounted at eaves level on the buildings. The clutter of the trams reappeared in 2017 with the Edinburgh Trams project. The road's function as a primary transport corridor dates from Edinburgh's post war Abercrombie Plan which proposed York Place and Queen Street as a dual carriageway. This was to then go under the Moray Estate in a tunnel. The one piece which was completed was the huge Picardy Place roundabout, which was to link to a tunnel through Calton Hill reached by a huge bridge over Greenside, leading to a further dual carriageway on the Pleasance. The previous narrow streets in the Picardy area acted as a natural traffic restrictor. The removal of these (including Arthur Conan Doyle's birthplace) to created a traffic-dominated junction is practically irreversible. At the completion of the Picardy Place roundabout in the 1970s, York Place ceased to be an exclusive address of tranquility.

It is located on the Katastrophenbucht (‚Ä≥disaster bay‚Ä≥) in Zug, Switzerland.  Description  Cogliatti painted Trompe-l'≈ìil in 1998 with acrylic paint on the concrete wall of the Zug Vorstadtbr√ºcke bridge. In this artwork, she juxtaposed three warm and two cold color fields (or vice versa). 21 color tones are set in contrast to one another in such a way that the colors run from warm yellow-orange on the side of the Vorstadtquai to rich purple, green and red, and finally towards the Alpenquai into a cool blue. Thus, they simulate a colored sky, from dusk to dawn. Cogliatti arranged the colored surfaces in order to create illusionistic interruptions, niches and windows in the wall and thus create an imaginary living space, a ‚Äúcolorful city‚Äù. Trompe-l'≈ìil complements the color of the colorful Vorstadt houses that are still standing (since the 1887 Vorstadtkatastrophe) and thus brings the sunken row of houses to new life. \\"The colorful reflections from the wall to the ceiling and to the floor create an aquarium feeling on hot days ...\\" The sequence of colors is also reminiscent of the course of the day, from dusk to dawn. \\"The large open areas on the mural [...] form an ideal platform for various messages.\\" \\"There is a place in Zug that leads directly into the soul of young people. A kind of physical Facebook [...] - the great colorful wall in the disaster bay, between R√∂ssliwiese and Alpenquai.\\"  History  In the 1970s, Hans Potthof painted the 112 meter concrete wall of the Vorstadtbr√ºcke bridge with the assitance of children; but graffiti destroyed the painting during decades. In 1995, Cogliatti instructed 55 children to paint the same concrete wall on behalf of the Zuger Schul‚Äì und Stadtbauamt (‚Ä≥Zug school and municipal building authorities‚Ä≥). The leitmotiv theme for the painting work was \\"Living space\\", the painting was mainly in shades of blue - allusions to the houses that had sunk into the lake there in 1887. The wall painting was inaugurated on July 6, 1995, one day after the complete renovation of the Rigiplatz above, which is reminiscent of the same disaster. After the painting had been ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù several times in 1995, the city commissioned Cogliatti to redesign the wall in 1998. With the help of a flat painter and over a period of approximately 140 hours, the artist implemented ‚Äúher own sculptural and color visions‚Äù. One of Cogliatti‚Ä≤s artistic goals, among others, was to use painterly means to give the impression of a third dimension. She therefore gave her work the name Trompe-l‚Äô≈ìil, which means \\"eye delusion\\"; for this, the dominance of the window hatches in the wall had to be broken. Cogliatti completed the work in early August 1998.

From 1 November 1870 to 1 November 1873 he was articled to John McMurdy. He then entered Trinity College Dublin where he obtained a Bachelor of Engineering in 1875 with special certificates in practical engineering as well as mechanical and experimental physics. Career He began to practice as an independent architect and civil engineer in 1877. In 1880 he won a competition for a design of a concert hall held by the Royal Irish Academy of Music. He also exhibited at the Royal Hibernian Academy that year, as well as in 1881-1883, 1886 and 1896. He was surveyor to the Kingstown Estate from 1896 to 1903. He entered into a partnership with George Murray Ross in late 1898 or early 1899. The partnership opened a London office in 1900. He had a reputation for expertise in domestic sanitation and sewage as well as architecture. He was engineer to the Dublin Sanitory Association from 1883 to 1890. He was consulting engineer to the Ulster Sanitory Association in 1891.

It is situated in the Cascade Range, less than north of Spirit Lake, and northeast of Coldwater Peak. Its nearest higher neighbor is Mount Margaret, to the northeast, and Mount St. Helens rises to the south. Precipitation runoff from The Dome is drained by Coldwater Creek, a tributary of the North Fork Toutle River. Geology The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity occurred. The lateral blast from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens was pointed straight toward The Dome and stripped the vegetation from the slopes. Due to Mount Saint Helens' proximity to The Dome, volcanic ash is common in the area.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Climate Coldwater Peak and The Dome (right) from the northeast The Dome from SSE, beyond Spirit Lake The Dome is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.

V.Y. Kantak translated it into English with the title Intimate Asides (1995). Publication The book was first published in 1965 by Swati Prakashan, Bombay. It contains 51 essays that Joshi wrote during the period from 1955 to 1964. The essays are of different lengths, arranged in a loose sequence. The essays are untitled but numbered serially. Contents Janantike (aside) is a term used in classical Sanskrit dramaturgy to indicate a situation where one character whispers something into the ear of another character, apparently excluding the audience from sharing it. Joshi states in the preface to the collection that the essays are written in a Janantik form, suggesting they are personal essays. Some essays in the collection are autobiographical in nature. The chief theme of the essays is reminiscence (smara·πá in Gujarati). In the opening essays, as well as in some later ones, Joshi recaptures the impressions of his earlier days, especially his childhood. He writes about his childhood impressions of his home region which lies towards the South Gujarat, the castle which is now in ruins, the dense forest of Saatkashi, the river Zankhari and the wondrous fairy world of childhood. Some specific memories are interwoven with these past impressions: the memory of certain deaths in the family, the images of a grandfather and an aunt are overlaid with the sadness of existence. Reception Janantike was awarded the Narmad Suvarna Chandrak (also known as the Narmad Gold Medal) literary award in 1965. One of Joshi's best known works, Janantike is considered to be one of the important contributions to Gujarati essays. V.Y. Kantak translated it into English by V. Y. Kantak with the title Intimate Asides (1995), published by Sahitya Akademi. Gujarati writer Meghnad Bhatt cites Janantike as 'undoubtedly' the best collection of essays in Gujarati literature. Because of the 'rare modern sensibility' of the essays, critic Digish Mehta consider it a 'significant contribution' to Gujarati prose style.

He founded and edited the underground magazines the Ann Arbor Argus and SunDance, and was a notable interviewer for Playboy magazine. Early life Ken Kelley was born on September 24, 1949, in Ann Arbor and grew up in Monroe, MI. He attended the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor on a full scholarship, studying chemistry but dropping out after three semesters. While at University of Michigan, he worked on the student newspaper, the Michigan Daily, lived at the Trans-Love Energies commune off campus, and was involved in the White Panther Party. Career In 1969, Kelley founded the Ann Arbor Argus, which ran until 1971 and reached a circulation of 14,000.\\"The underground press: a special report\\" by John Burks. Rolling Stone, Oct. 4, 1969. In the early 1970s, Kelley moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and, along with Craig Pyes, founded SunDance, an underground magazine funded by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Kelley joined the staff of the Berkeley Barb in February 1973 and became managing editor that summer. \\"But he has turned many chores over to his managing editor, who is Ken Kelley, now 22 and a veteran underground newspaper worker ... Young Kelley went to Ann Arbor to be a chemistry major, managed three semesters before it stuck in his craw and left to write for underground newspapers ... He has been with the Barb since February.\\" Alongside fellow Berkeley Barb columnists Dancing Bear and Gabrielle Schang, Kelley was a correspondent on Earthquake News, a 1973 alternative television news pilot in San Francisco. Starting in 1976, Kelley became a regular writer for Playboy, best known for his interviews of notable figures.

Kelley had traveled with Bryant and her husband for a week and protected her from a pieing incident while conducting the interview. The Kelley‚ÄìBryant interview is portrayed in the comedic play, Anita Bryant's Playboy Interview, which premiered in 2016 in Silver Lake, Los Angeles. Kelley also interviewed Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, Cheech & Chong, Abbie Hoffman, Arthur C. Clarke, and Ray Bradbury, among others, for Playboy. Kelley won a Maggie Award for his 1987 interview of Lyndon LaRouche for Focus Magazine.

He started writing a book about the Divine Light Mission entitled Brave New Bliss, but left it unfinished at the time of his death. Kelley was a press aide to Huey P. Newton. After Newton's death, Kelley wrote that Newton had admitted to ordering the murder of Betty Van Patter. \\"In an effort to bolster the defense, Robinson's attorney Alfons Wagner has subpoenaed Kelley, who was once Newton's press aide and who wrote after the slaying that Newton admitted ordering the execution of a former Black Panther Party bookkeeper in 1974 and shooting to death an Oakland prostitute in 1979.\\" Later life and death In 2005, Kelley was arrested on charges of possession of child pornography.

Setting The WWF defines the ecoregion as inhabiting mainland coasts and islands the Georgia Depression, a glacially depressed area dominated by the Salish Sea and numerous inflowing rivers. This differs from the Strait of Georgia/Puget Lowland ecoregion defined by the CEC in that it explicitly excludes the lowlands along the east coast of Vancouver Island. The WWF considers these lowlands a part of the neighbouring Central Pacific coastal forests ecoregion. The landscape features glacially striated tablelands and rolling hills underlain by sedimentary rocks. The majority of soils in the depression are formed from glacial till, glacial outwash, and Lacustrine deposits. Elevations range from sea level to 460 m (1,509 ft), seldom exceeding 160 m (525 ft). Climate The ecoregion has a predominantly Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen Csb) with fresh, dry, sunny summers and cool winters with moderate precipitation and plentiful cloud cover. Further inland it gradually transitions into an Oceanic climate (K√∂ppen Cfb) with slightly milder, wetter summers. The mean annual temperature is 9¬∞C (48.2¬∞F), the mean summer temperature is 15¬∞C (59¬∞F), and the mean winter temperature is 3.5¬∞C (38.3¬∞F). Annual precipitation averages between 800 to 900 mm (31.5 to 35.4 in), but may be as high as 1,530 mm (60.2 in). Ecology=Flora Prairies of South Puget Sound Before European settlement, the Georgia Depression was dominated by dense coniferous forests of Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, and western white pine. The ecoregion was also home to extensive coastal wetlands and peat bog ecosystems scattered about in poorly drained areas. The lowlands south of Puget Sound were home to an extensive region of prairies. These ecosystems have since been greatly reduced in size due to the repurposing of these lands for agriculture, industry, and urban development. Fauna Great horned owl at the George C. Reifel Migratory Bird Sanctuary in Delta, British Columbia Mammals that inhabit this ecoregion include black-tailed deer, coyote, raccoon, mink, sea otter, and harbour seal. Birds represent the majority of resident species, including cooper‚Äôs hawk, bald eagle, turkey vulture, owl, blue grouse, waterfowl, and numerous passerine species. Threats and preservation=Development This ecoregion lies within the most densely populated area of British Columbia and Washington, including the metropolitan areas of Vancouver and Seattle. Consequently, only 5% of the original lowland forest habitat within the region remains, and over 90% of these remaining areas have been heavily altered from their natural state. Most exist as tree farms, city parks, or as small state/provincial parks geographically isolated from one another. Climate change Sea-level rise threatens to permanently flood large swaths of coastal wetland and lowland forest. Regions at highest risk include the Fraser Lowland and Skagit Valley. Preservation The opportunity exists to use local conservation easements to protect remaining riparian and wetland areas, restore a portion of the old-growth forests, and provide connections to adjacent ecoregions. The best candidates for conservation include the establishment of more forest connections between the forests of the Olympic Peninsula and Cascade Mountains just south of Olympia and the protection of Burns Bog within Metro Vancouver.

The grey years in Cuba refer to a loosely defined period in Cuban history that is generally agreed to have started with the Padilla affair in 1971. The period has been termed and dated as the quinquenio gris (\\"five grey years\\"), the decada negra (\\"black decade\\"), or the trinquenio amargo (\\"bitter fifteen years\\"). The period occurred during the tenure of Luis Pav√≥n Tamayo as the head of the National Cultural Council. The period is generally defined by cultural censorship, official demotion of artists, and the harassment of LGBT people. The strengthening of internal repression inside Cuba was also occurring alongside greater influence from the Soviet Union in the political affairs and economy of Cuba. This soviet influence lead to mimicry in Cuba's new laws and policies at the time. History=Background By 1968 Cuba was entering a new political direction. The year was marked by the death of Che Guevara, Fidel Castro's support of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, and the total nationalization of all property and censorship of cultural actors in the \\"Revolutionary Offensive\\". In 1970 the Cuban government organized all aspects of Cuban society to participate in a sugar can harvest to attempt to harvest ten million tons. When the harvest failed to reach its goal, Soviet influence in the economy increased. By 1972 there were around ten thousand Russians living in Havana, Russian replaced English as the business language of Cuba, and Cuba officially joined Comecon. Developments The recognized beginning of the grey years came with the arrest of Heberto Padilla in April 27, 1971 for his 1968 book \\"In Hard Times\\" which criticized Cuban censorship. The Padilla affair stirred international outrage, and intellectuals Jean Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Italo Calvino, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, and others signed a protest letter in regard to the arrest. After the affair the National Cultural Council was reorganized and headed by Luis Pav√≥n Tamayo which lead to the CNC being labeled the \\"Pavonato\\". In Fidel Castro's April 30, 1971 closing speech at the first National Congress of Education and Culture he criticized pseudo-leftists, \\"intellectual rats\\", and homosexuals. The CNC would enact policies that targeted censored \\"high-risk\\" arts, specifically theatre. Artists that were not trusted ideologically, or considered homosexuals were marginalized. The aficianados movement was developed by the CNC which was a coordinated effort with political organizations in Cuba to disseminate instructors of Marxism Leninism and resist Ideological diversionism. Throughout the grey years campaigns of censorship against Ideological diversionism and counter-cultural expressions like long hair on men, were common. Afro-Cuban culture, especially religions like Santeria and Palo were seen as an expression of counter- revolutionary black nationalism, and censored. In 1975 the CNC working with Soviet advisors required that Marxism Leninism be taught by all educators in Cuba. In 1976 a soviet-style constitution was adopted that centralized high leadership positions and consolidated power for the Communist Party of Cuba. Ending Luis Pav√≥n Tamayo stepped down from his position at the National Cultural Council in 1976. Pavon's leaving and the creation of a new Ministry of Culture is often held as the end of the grey years. Within Cuba other dates of the grey years exist which purport that cultural repression continued well after 1976.

In 1842, the area next to Beterverwagting was bought by Lambert Christian and named Triumph. Christian ran into financial problems, and the people of Beterverwagting tried to buy the land in two terms. The government stepped in and bought the land.

It includes the dry forests of the northwestern Yucat√°n Peninsula. Geography The Yucat√°n dry forests occupy the northwestern portion of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. They cover most of the state of Yucat√°n, the northern portion of Campeche, and small areas of northwestern Quintana Roo. It is bounded on the east and south by the Yucat√°n moist forests ecoregion. The Gulf of Mexico lies to the north and west, and the coast is fringed with mangroves. The region is mostly flat, lying below 400 meters elevation. The underlying rocks are porous limestone and coral, and the region has extensive underground drainage, including caverns and sinkholes, with few surface streams or rivers. The cities of M√©rida and Campeche are located in the ecoregion. Climate The climate of the ecoregion is tropical and subhumid. Rainfall is less than 1200 mm per year, with a long dry season. Flora The predominant vegetation is open-canopied dry forest and thorn scrub. Most trees and shrubs are deciduous, losing their leaves during the long dry season. Cacti are common, particularly nearer the coast. Grassy and herbaceous understory plants are generally sparse. In the drier central portion of the ecoregion, tsalam (Lysiloma bahamensis) and jab√≠n (Piscidia piscipula) are the predominant trees, with Alvaradoa amorphoides, Bursera simaruba, Cedrela mexicana, Chlorophora tinctoria, Cordia gerascanthus, and Lonchocarpus rugosus. Elsewhere Vitex gaumeri, Brosimum alicastrum, Caesalpinia gaumeri, Cedrela odorata, Ceiba pentandra, and Sideroxylon foetidissimum are common. Along the northern coast tall columnar cacti are abundant. Common species include Cephalocereus gaumeri, Pterocereus gaumeri, and Lemaireocereus griseus. About 10% of plants are endemic to the ecoregion. The tropical moist forests to the south isolate the Yucat√°n dry forests from other dry forest ecoregions in Mexico and Central America. Fauna Approximately 96 mammal species are native to the ecoregion. These include the jaguar (Panthera onca), white-nosed coati (Nasua narica), black-handed spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), and southern opossum (Didelphis marsupialis). Over 290 bird species inhabit the ecoregion, with two endemic species. Resident birds include white-fronted amazon (Amazona albifrons) and lesser yellow-headed vulture (Cathartes burrovianus). Native reptiles include the Mexican beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum). Conservation and protected areas Extensive areas of dry forest have been cleared for cattle ranching and for agriculture, including henequ√©n plantations. A 2017 assessment found that only 278 km¬≤, or 3%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas.

D. Irving group of companies, has its headquarters in Dieppe, New Brunswick and potato processing plants in New Annan, Prince Edward Island, Lethbridge, Alberta, and Jamestown, North Dakota, and an appetizer plant in Wheatley, Ontario. It is the 4th largest processor of frozen potato products in North America. It was established in 1980. The New Annan facility employs about 700 people. It is \\"one of the largest employers in the Prince Edward Island. Cavendish Farms is the \\"largest private-sector employer on P.E.I.\\" About 80 P.E.I. farmers grow potatoes for Cavendish Farms. Background In 1980 Irving Group purchased C.M. Mclean potato and vegetable processing facility in PEI Canada and renamed it Cavendish Farms. In 2001, Cavendish Farms acquired its \\"first US processing plant in Jamestown, North Dakota\\". Cavendish Farms is part of the family-owned Irving Group of Companies established in 1882. Cavendish Farms is the 4th largest processor of frozen potato products in North America, and the \\"largest private-sector employer\\" on P.E.I. Prince Edward Island is known for its potatoes‚Äîthe potato industry employs‚Äîdirectly or indirectly‚Äî about 12% of the Island's workforce, and contributes over $1 billion annually to the P.E.I. which represents 10.8% of the province's GDP. In 2013 about 88,000 acres of potatoes were grown on P.E.I. Of the three types of potatoes harvested table potatoes, seed potatoes, and processing potatoes, about 60% of P.E.I. are \\"manufactured into French fries, potato chips, and many other products.\\" By 2020, about 80 P.E.I. farmers grew potatoes for Cavendish Farms. Potato industry in Prince Edward Island P.E.I.'s potato industry is the \\"biggest economic driver in the province\\". In 2017, P.E.I. had the \\" largest potato crop in Canada\\", according to Statistics Canada.\\" \\"Processing potatoes into french fries and other frozen products represents up to 70 per cent of the industry.\\" Ground water (Prince Edward Island) Prince Edward Island implemented a moratorium on deep well irrigation in 2002 to protect its ground water supply. At an October 2015 P.E.I. Environmental Advisory Committee meeting to draft a Water Act, Leo Broderick with the Council of Canadians said that the Island needs to \\"legislate a ban on deep well irrigation to prevent long-term groundwater depletion\\". The Ministry of Environment provides an online‚Äîboth historical and real-time‚Äîof groundwater levels (GWLs) with data from 14 groundwater level observation wells across PEI: Baltic, Bear River, Bloomfield, Caledonia, Georgetown, Knutsford, Lakeside, New Dominon, New Zealand Road, Riverdale, Sleepyhollow, Souris Line Road, Souris River Road, St. Charles, Summerside GST, and York. The major source of water supplies in Prince Edward Island‚Äîboth industrial and potable‚Äîis groundwater from 260 watersheds that are \\"relatively small and non-contiguous.\\" In the late 2010s, the agriculture sector's demand for supplemental irrigation, has presented several challenges for \\"water and resource managers\\". Because of the uneven topography of the island and its \\"relatively small and non-contiguous watersheds\\", \\"pumping groundwater has ... raised concerns for groundwater sustainability.\\" In their January 2020 article in the journal Water, the authors write that an \\"inventory of groundwater is necessary for efficient water resource management, especially in relation to growing groundwater demands for agricultural use. It is neither feasible nor economical to install and manage monitoring groundwater wells in a place like Prince Edward Island, which consists of 260 watersheds for efficient water management.\\" By 2016, yields for P.E.I. process growers were not increasing at pace with other North American regions, according to P.E.I. Potato Board. In 2017, because of \\"limited availability of potatoes on the Island\\" the company imported 150 million pounds of potatoes in 2017 from New Brunswick, Manitoba, Alberta and Maine, according to Ron Clow, the General Manager of Cavendish Farms. CBC News reported on May 14, 2018, that \\"French-fry giant Cavendish Farms\\" had \\"reiterated its desire to see the end of a moratorium on new high-capacity agricultural wells\\" which Irving said would help P.E.I. potato farmers \\"stay competitive\\". At the Greater Charlottetown Area Chamber of Commerce's annual general meeting, the company president, Robert K. Irving‚Äîwho was the keynote speaker‚Äîsaid that without \\"supplemental irrigation\\" is needed when low rainfalls and drought-type conditions would mean below-average yields during potato growing season.\\" Potatoes are sensitive to soil water deficits compared to other crops such as wheat, and need frequent irrigation, especially while tubers are growing. With climate change, reduced rainfall in many areas is predicted to increase the need for irrigation of potato crops. Potatoes require 8.4 gallons of water needed to produce 100 grams of each crop, which is quite efficient compared to corn. In July 2018, Cavendish Farms announced that because of a shortage of Island potatoes, they would be closing their fresh packaging facility in O‚ÄôLeary and laying off 40 workers. Covid-19 pandemic P.E.I. farm owner, Douglas Campbell, who is District Director of the National Farmers Union, expressed concern that \\"family farms will disappear unless they are forced under the umbrella of the industrial sector, the processors and retailer. Farmers are often under pressure to use farm practices which they know are destructive. In PEI alone thousands of farm families have been pushed off the land.\\" During the COVID-19 pandemic, with inter-provincial borders already closed, Cavendish Farms said that because of a surplus of potatoes, that the \\"P.E.I. potato producers under contract to supply\\" Cavendish Farms with potatoes should \\"sell to other markets if they can\\". Campbell raised concerns that the $4.7 million relief fund announced by the PEI Minister of Agriculture was largely \\"destined\\" for the Irving group of companies. When Cavendish Farms became aware that they had access to government pandemic relief funds, they told their potato producers under contract to supply, that they plan on taking \\"potatoes from the growers and produce marketable french fries\\". In a May 2020 CBC interview, the United Potato Growers of Canada (UPG)'s general manager, Kevin MacIsaac, said that \\"french fry processors are asking their growers to plant anywhere from 15 to 35 per cent fewer\\" potatoes in 2020, which had resulted in a surplus of \\"80 million pounds of unsold seed potatoes\\". A veteran potato farmer from Grahams Road, P.E.I. who had farmed since the 1970s, said that he had \\"700,000 pounds of unsold seed potatoes in cold storage\\" that in a normal year would have yielded over \\"10 million pounds of potatoes in the fall, ready to be processed into french fries.\\" The province provided \\"$4.7 million to pay for shipping and storage of processed potatoes in order to have Cavendish Farms... use up existing stocks from Island growers\\". The P.E.I. Potato Board said that the provincial funds meant that 100 million pounds of P.E.I. potatoes were processed which \\"protected $13 million in revenues\\" for the potato producers, roughly 80 Island farmers. Lands Protection Act In 2019, the P.E.I. chapter of the National Farmers Union raised concerns that the spirit of the province's 1980s Lands Protection Act was not being respected as three farm corporations,‚ÄîGalloway Farms Ltd., Long River Farms Ltd. and Indian River Farms Ltd.‚Äîall naming Mary Jean Irving and/or one or both of her two daughters, Rebecca and Elizabeth Irving, as shareholders and directors‚Äîsubmitted 32 applications to the Island Regulatory and Appeals Commission to \\"purchase parcels of land totalling 2,221 acres in the Summerside area currently owned by Brendel Farms Ltd.\\" The Lands Protection Act \\"set limits on land ownership of 1,000 acres for individuals, and 3,000 acres for corporations.\\" In response to the concerns, Mary Jean Irving said that she has been on the \\"Island and growing potatoes for 29 years\\" and her two daughters are also interested in farming. Irving said that \\"neither J. D. Irving group of companies, nor its subsidiary Cavendish Farms, were involved with the proposed land purchases\\". Indian River Farms Indian River Farms, which is also owned Irving group of companies, is managed by Elizabeth Irving, who is a fifth generation family member. Indian River Farms was established in 1992 and has a staff of about 20 to 49. Its main production is Irish potatoes. In the late 2010s, during a period of long stretches of dry weather\\" on the Island, potato growers in the area around Spring Valley, Prince Edward Island began to construct large holding ponds of water \\"seeking to improve potato yields\\". By 2019, Indian River Farms had seven large holding ponds near Spring Valley and were building more. Electric pumps housed in sheds feed ground water into the large ponds, some of which are constructed on \\"raised berms, above ground level\\". All are supplied with groundwater from \\"multiple low-capacity wells nearby\\" using electric pumps, housed in sheds. In a July 4, 2019 article in The Guardian, concerns were raised by some Islanders about the way in which large holding ponds in \\"the back country, away from people\\" were circumventing the spirit of the ban on new high-capacity agricultural wells on P.E.I. A concerned group of Islanders toured an irrigation pond in Spring Valley. Elizabeth Irving, who is a fifth generation family member of the 135-family Irving group and the manager of Indian River Farms said that a study undertaken by a hydrologist contracted by Indian River Farm, suggested that farming only uses \\"less than one percent of the annual recharge from surface runoff and precipitation\\". Locations The company's head office is Dieppe, New Brunswick with sales offices in Toronto, Montreal, and Boston. Cavendish Farms has potato processing plants in New Annan, Prince Edward Island, Lethbridge, Alberta, and Jamestown, North Dakota, and an appetizer plant in Wheatley, Ontario. New Annan, Prince Edward Island By 2020, the New Annan facility, which employs 700, was \\"one of the largest employers in the Prince Edward Island\\" In 2017 the company constructed a \\"50 million pound refrigerated storage facility.\\" Jamestown, North Dakota Cavendish Farms acquired facilities in Jamestown, North Dakota in 2001‚Äîits first processing plant. Lethbridge The company acquired a processing plant in Lethbridge, Alberta in 2013 and in 2017, opened a new frozen potato processing plant there. Partnerships Cavendish Farms partnered with Holland College's Culinary Institute of Canada to establish the Cavendish Culinary Creation Center. Yields for P.E.I. process growers were not increasing at pace with other North American regions, according to P.E.I. Potato Board. In May 2016, Cavendish Farms, its process growers, the government of PEI's Potato Board and the Department of Agriculture began a three-year Enhanced Agronomy Initiative, which is led by the Potato Board's Ryan Barrett. to \\"increase yields and profits.\\" All four partners are jointly funding the Initiative, which will cost $180,000 a year for the three years. The growers funding is paid through a \\"special check-off on their processing contracts\\". The Initiative's steering committee also includes Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and the Dalhousie Faculty of Agriculture representatives.

During the Spanish Civil War he was commander of the Ascaso Column and later the militarized 28th Division, which fought on the Aragon front.  Biography = Early years  As a child he emigrated to Valencia, where he joined socialist and later anarchist youth organizations. Around 1911, after completing military service as a conscript, he again emigrated to Barcelona, where he worked as a carpenter, joining the corresponding CNT union. Persecuted for his activism, he took refuge in Valencia for a time, and then returned to Barcelona, where he was elected delegate of the Catalan Wood Union, although he was also active in the Los Valencianos group. On August 12, 1923, he took part in the regional congress of the CNT held in Manresa, rejecting the post of secretary offered to him because he was declared illiterate. With the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera increased the repression against the labor movement as groups of gunmen, organized by the Sindicatos Libres, began to mortally attack the most exposed union activists. As a means of defense, Jover helped found the illegalist direct action group Los Solidarios, organized in independent cells in defense and support of armed with the group of Spanish anarchists of the CNT-FAI. With Buenaventura Durruti, he took part in organizing the assassination of the prime minister Eduardo Dato e Iradier (March 8, 1921), although he did not take part directly in the action. It was during one of these \\"operations\\" that on March 24, 1924, Jover was arrested in Barcelona, but managed to escape and go into exile in Paris together with Francisco Ascaso, Buenaventura Durruti and most of the militiamen of Los Solidarios. There he worked in a mattress factory and turned down an offer to become a factory foreman. He was also one of the organizers of the failed expedition to Bera (November 7, 1924) and the attempted assault on the Drassanes barracks (November 24, 1924). Meanwhile, in 1923 and 1924, his partner Nieves Castella had two children, Emma and Liberto. In order to avoid expulsion from France, along with Buenaventura Durruti and Francisco Ascaso he emigrated to Latin America, where he created another illegalist group Los Errantes, which organized the first expropriation robbery in the country's history.AteneoVirtual The group returned to Paris in 1926. In 1927 Jover took part in the organization of the assassination attempt on Alfonso XIII, but despite the order of summons and search, he managed to escape arrest. In 1931, with the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, he returned to Barcelona and rejoined the CNT. From November 1932 he was a member of the committee of the Barcelona Metallurgical Union. As a member of the Nosotros group, he was the protagonist of many anti-capitalist direct actions and several uprisings, which cost him some periods of imprisonment. Spanish Civil War After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936, he quickly joined the Confederal militias and went on to lead the Ascaso Column in its advance from Barcelona to the Arag√≥n front, also participating in the politics of the towns nearby, where they were able to organize their libertarian ideas in practice. Jover's column, together with other militias, headed towards Huesca, establishing positions around the city while besieging it. Along with other anarchists such as Liberto Callejas, Ada Mart√≠ and Maximo Franco, commanders of the Red and Black Column, and together with the POUM, they participated in the so-called Barcelona May Days of 1937, during which the Friends of Durruti Group (with about 5,000 militants) was established. After the militarization of the militias decreed by the republican government, in 1937 he went on to lead the 28th Division, which fought on the front of Aragon, in Teruel, in the Levante and in Estremadura. In May 1938 he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. From the spring of that year he was in command of the 10th Army Corps, fighting on the Segre Front until the fall of Catalonia in January 1939. Exile Exiled to France,\\"La retirada\\", an essay by Pietro Ramella Jover was arrested on February 10, 1939, in La Guingueta d'Ix on the pretext that he had already been expelled from France twelve years earlier. He was interned for 41 days in Perpignan prison, from which he was released on April 4 after being sentenced to 15 days. He was then sent to Le Vernet concentration camp until July 10, 1939, but thanks to the permission of the sub-prefect of Prades he was granted permission to reside, here he was supported thanks to the monthly subsidies of 2,000 francs sent to him by the Spanish Refugee Evacuation Service (SERE). However, in October 1939, the police again identified him as the Gregorio Jover that was expelled from France in 1925 and on October 18 he was interned again in the Sant Cebri√† de Rossell√≥ camp. The internment made him see that he was suffering a persecution that made his life impossible in France. He then decided to leave for the Americas, before embarking for Santo Domingo and then Mexico. He was elected secretary of the subdelegation of the CNT in Mexico and the Committee on Relations and Aid, on whose behalf in 1945 he requested the entry of the CNT into the Spanish Republican government in exile. Gregorio Jover Cort√©s died in Mexico on March 22, 1964.

In 1914 they were distributed among four large provinces, with some boundary changes. In 1933 the provinces were restructured into six, again with boundary changes. The number of districts fluctuated between 12 and 26 through splits and consolidations, first rising, then falling, then rising again. History Districts of the Congo Free State in 1895 The Congo Free State was annexed by Belgium in 1908 to become the Belgian Congo. At first the structure of districts was retained. In 1910 the western districts of Banana, Boma, Matadi and Cataractes were consolidated into one administrative unit, Bas-Congo, reducing the number to twelve. Parts of the Stanley Falls and Lualaba districts were combined to form Katanga in 1910, which was called a vice-government general. Otherwise, the Free State districts were maintained until 28 March 1912. An arr√™t√© royal of 28 March 1912 divided the Congo into 22 districts. An arr√™t√© royal of 28 July 1914 grouped the districts into the provinces of Congo-Kasa√Ø, √âquateur, Orientale Province and Katanga, with the objective of improving responsiveness through decentralization. The consolidation had in fact started in Katanga in 1912 and Orientale in 1913, but Congo-Kasai did not formally become a vice-government until 1919. Each of the new provinces was made up of several of the existing districts. The colonial administrators felt the need to assign the many diverse ethnic groups to defined territories, where before they had often been mobile. The districts were divided into territories, which in turn were divided into sectors, and many chiefdoms were recognized. Several of the smallest might be combined into one sector, while the largest chiefdoms were split across sectors. The original four provinces had considerable autonomy, but in 1933 they were reorganized into six provinces, named after their capitals, and the central government assumed more control. The Congo-Kasa√Ø and Orientale provinces were both split, and some other adjustments were made to form six provinces named after their capitals; L√©opoldville, Lusambo (Kasai), Costermansville (Kivu), Elisabethville (Katanga), Stanleyville (Orientale) and Coquilhatville (√âquateur). The number of districts was reduced to 15, with 102 territories. Provincial boundaries remained fairly stable until after independence in 1960. There continued to be frequent adjustments to district and territory boundaries, mostly to recognise sectional and tribal divisions. By 1956 there were 26 districts and 135 territories. Districts in 1910 1910 districts In 1910 there were 12 districts. Clockwise, starting from the mouth of the Congo River, they were: *Bas-Congo *Moyen-Congo *Lac L√©opold II *√âquateur *Bangala *Ubangi *Uele *Aruwimi *Stanleyville *Katanga *Kasai *Kwango 1912 districts Districts in 1912 In 1912 there were 22 districts.

Part of the district had been reassigned to Katanga *Katanga had been made into a vice governorship general, and divided into Lomami (including part of the old Kasai), Tanganika-Moero, Haut-Luapula and Lulua (including part of the old Kasai) The districts in 1912 were: *Bas-Congo *Moyen-Congo *Lac L√©opold II *√âquateur *Lulonga *Bangala *Ubangi *Bas-Uele *Haut-Uele *Aruwimi *Stanleyville *Lowa *Ituri *Maniema *Kivu *Sankuru *Kasai *Kwango *Lomami *Tanganika-Moero *Haut-Luapula *Lulua Districts in 1926 1926 provinces and districts By 1926 the districts had been organized into four large provinces, with some boundary changes. Apart from boundary adjustments, the district-level changes were: *A new urban district of L√©opoldville had been created around the capital city *Moyen-Congo had been merged into Bas- Congo (south) and Lac L√©opold II (north) *Lowa and Maniema had been combined into a new Maniema, losing part of their territory to Kivu to the east.

Since 2000 it has been improved and recovered by a team of professionals, with the archaeologist Estela Mart√≠nez Mora in charge of the studies at the site. Originally it was estimated that the flowering of this site took place between AD 900 and 1100, that is, during the Mesoamerican Postclassic Period, however recent findings - particularly Monument 32 - have led archaeologists to think that the flowering could have occurred in 600 AD C. With an area of about 210 hectares, Tamtoc was one of the most important Huastecan urban centers of the last pre-Hispanic period due to its dimensions and characteristics. Its development lasted a few centuries before the Spanish arrived, until its sudden abandonment in the 16th century. It is located on the northeast bank of the Tampa√≥n River, part of the P√°nuco River system. One of the characteristics that distinguishes Tamtoc is the remarkable feminine presence. To date, 90% of the burials discovered have been women. In addition, women are depicted in most of the clay and ceramic figurines found here and are thought to have held a high rank in the social divisions of the community. The area has been known since the late 1800s to have pre-Columbian vestiges. It was explored in the late 1930s by Joaqu√≠n Meade, and with greater intensity in the 1960s and was finally opened to the public on May 11, 2006 by the then- governor of San Luis Potos√≠, Marcelo de los Santos Fraga.  Geography  The ancient city of Tamtoc settled on the Tamu√≠n plain, in the meander of the Tampa√≥n River. The geographical environment favored the production and collection of food that ensured the subsistence of numerous settlements settled around it. The Tampa√≥n River, an important source of food, was the axis of merchandise exchange and social interaction with other regions. The people of Tamtoc hunted and collected various products in the nearby mountain ranges. The Sierra de Tanchipa was also a sandstone quarry that served the artists as raw material to carve sculptures of rulers, priestesses and various public stelae that showed relevant events, memory of social and symbolic order. From the Cerro del Murcielago, green stone or tingua√≠ta was extracted that was transformed into corporal ornaments and utilitarian objects. The plains and mountains that make up the landscape of Tamtoc were the scene of its historical evolution, guaranteed its economic sustenance and played a relevant role in the ritual and ideological aspect; Highlights in the topographic relief were indicators of astronomical phenomena and important references that influenced the design of the city itself.  History = Local history  Tamtoc is considered the pre-Hispanic capital of the Huasteca for its regional, military and commercial importance. Until now, at least three periods of occupation have been identified: the oldest occurred around 600 BC, which corresponds to the time of the emergence of the city. The second occupation took place between 600 AD and 900 AD, it is distinguished by the arrival of a cultural trend without antecedents in the region that was in charge of redesigning the urban aspect of Tamtoc, strongly marking the regional leadership of the city. The last period happened between 900 and 1350 AD, it was characterized by an important population increase and an intense constructive activity that accounts for an increasingly powerful and complex society. At the end of this period, for reasons still unknown, the site lost regional hegemony and was abandoned.  Temporality  Tamtoc flourished in a very ancient time. While the Priestess was being carved, in Greece they were in the Peloponnese Wars, Rome did not exist, the Olmecs were at their peak, Egypt was in its late period, Babylon had already been abandoned and the Incas had not yet reached Peru.  Archaeological Site  More than seventy structures have been discovered at the archaeological site, which have been recorded on drawings and maps. In the perimeter open to visitors there are thirty of them. There is a central square that probably functioned as a civic or administrative center, built in the last moments of the city. The main structures with: East Structure or El Tizate, which has an altitude of 36 m. East Structure or Paso Bayo, has an altitude of 21 m, and is considered a religious structure. The Corcovado, a circular structure, considered a commercial and political point. Monument 32, also known as The Priestess. Monument 22, is also known as \\"El Robernante\\" \\"Cinco Caracol\\" or \\"Tom√°s\\", is a stone that represents the lower part of a naked man with a pierced penis and protected with an ixtle cover, that is to say, it is a allusion to the creation of the man of the Fifth Sun by Quetzalc√≥atl.2 The sculpture of the Scarred Woman or Venus of Tamtoc, is a fragmented female sculpture dating from 600 BC. C.  Structures = East Structure  Also known as \\"Paso Bayo\\" or \\"Tamtoque\\" it has a height of 21 meters. Elevated structures, such as this one, commonly served as the basis for very important temples, from which various rituals related to the measurement of time and the movement of heavenly bodies were conducted. This structure is the second tallest on the site and marks the eastern limit of the monumental area.  Main Plaza  This group is made up of 23 architectural structures, of which 18 are around a plaza and five in the central part, all associated with administrative and religious activities. The remaining structures have been identified as habitation bases belonging to the ruling elite, with the exception of structure AW3, which is identified as a small altar. Almost all the structures in this group have stairs that led to the upper part, where a temple or the housing complex was located. Tamtoc Main Square in winter with Paso Bayo in the background Structures AC1, AC2 and AW3 stand out because human burials were deposited inside them and in each of these two twin anthropomorphic stelae were found as offering. The square has at least two construction periods, the first occurring between 600 and 900 AD. C. represented by circular structures most of these were covered by more recent structures. The buildings that can be seen today correspond to the last period between 900 and 1350 AD, when the city reached its peak.  Northeast Plaza  This group is made up of 10 mounds, nine of which surround a plaza and one is somewhat separated to the north. This set is associated with housing functions and the production of textiles.  North set  Canal del Manantial with Monument 32 (The Priestess) in the background and Structure 10 on the right This area is made up of several structures and stands out for the discovery of different monuments such as the tombstone of the Flamingos, The Giant, the Castrill√≥n Stela, La Venus de Tamtoc and the megalith of La Priestess (Monument 32). In this place there are springs that, through a system of old channels, distribute water to different parts of the sector, ending in the Laguna de los Patos. Recent archaeological excavations carried out at the foot of structure C3, allowed to identify a place of production of beads for necklace and other ornaments.  Ferris Wheel  The area of La Noria is an important place in the city of Tamtoc, which has undergone constant changes due to the times that the city passed. Mainly the three main uses that it had over time can be differentiated, which were the following: = Fountain = Also known as Caja de Agua, it is part of the North Group sector and is where the ancient city of Tamtoc originated, because here the water is born and, due to its importance for life, it was considered a sacred place. The inhabitants of Tamtoc built a series of water distribution channels from the spring, from which a number of offerings have been recovered, including the monumental sculpture of The Priestess. These elements correspond to the first occupation, approximately in 600 a. C. = Work area = The Water Box was modified during the following period (600 and 900 AD), the space was desacralized and used in daily tasks represented by two ovens recovered in recent excavations, which could be used for food processing. = Cemetery = In the last period of occupation (between 900 and 1350 AD), new architectural buildings, temples, walkways and open spaces associated with religious ceremonies and sacred rituals were built in the same space as La Noria. A set of funerary tumults stands out from which around seventy human skeletons corresponding to individuals of different ages and sexes have been recovered. The autopsies carried out on the skeletons have revealed that they suffered from severe infections, ‚ÄúIn the bones of all individuals, noticeable deformations and traces of this type of pathology have been identified. So far, the population with these characteristics has only been located in this part of the site, \\"said Mart√≠nez Mora, who together with Guillermo C√≥rdova Tello, coordinates the Archaeological Project of Origin and Development of the Urban Landscape of Tamtoc. = West Structure = It is one of the largest foundations on the site and has a front staircase. Formerly it was known as \\"El Tizate\\" because near this place, on the river bank, there is a deposit of crystallized carbonates or volcanic ash known locally as tizate, a material used in the production of ceramics. From its top, it is known that previously a temple was located, the entire environment of Tamtoc is dominated. This structure was the western marker that delimited the monumental area of the city. This basement is associated with activities related to astronomical observations for the cosmology that characterized the Huastec peoples. = Great Lagoon of the Ducks = The Great Lagoon of the Ducks, was thought at first to be a natural lagoon, but the hydrology and topography studies concluded that it was made by man. According to these investigations, it was prepared to avoid flooding by the Tampa√≥n River. During the recovery of the lagoon, various archaeological objects have been found that are part of offerings, which prevents working with heavy machinery to drain the lagoon, since it puts at risk the historical remains found there.  Monuments = The priestess  Monument 32, better known as the Priestess, is a monumental lunar calendar, larger and older than the one known as Piedra del Sol or \\"Aztec Calendar\\". Its exact age is not yet established, but it is estimated that it was made between 1150 and 700 BC. apparently by the Olmecs, a culture that was not previously known had been established in this area at such an early time. The calendar is a monolith of polymineral sandstone, eight meters long and four meters high, with a thickness of 50 cm. and a weight greater than 30 tons. It is found in the North Set, more specifically in El Manantial de La Noria. It was found accidentally in February 2005 while working on the restoration of the hydraulic channel that already during a time before the Spaniards led water from a spring to an artificial lagoon created within the city and it was until November 2006 when it was achieved. Monument 32, The Ruler or Thomas Because the weather and excess humidity caused by the rain and the stagnation of the spring water had started a process of degradation in the rock of the sculpture, for this reason the area of La Noria was subjected to intense conservation work; Currently, the work is focused on the recovery of a lagoon near the Spring, in order to integrate it into the public visit, since it is part of the natural environment where La Priestess was located.  The governor  Sculpture of the Scarred Woman as it is on display at the Tamtoc site museum, is over 2500 years old. Monument 22, El Robernante or simply Tom√°s, is the lower part of a male human sculpture, this monument could represent an important character, perhaps a ruler of Tamtoc called Cinco Caracol since the position of his hand seems to be designed to carry a baton and the different inscriptions on the monument. Their nudity has been interpreted as an expression of the importance that fertility had among these peoples and the cult of the phallus.  The Scarred Woman  The sculpture of the Scarred Woman or the \\"Venus of Tamtoc\\" was found in 2005 during the rescue work of \\"Monument 32;\\" which was submerged in water for more than 2,500 years. This female sculpture of more than 2,500 years old in the La Noria area, in Tamtoc, is an unprecedented discovery, since there was no record of such a well-worked and detailed sculpture in Mesoamerica of that antiquity, as well as being from the female gender, which represents a rethinking of the role that women played in the social, political and religious life of pre- Hispanic cultures. The stone work of the sculpture rivals that of Ancient Greece, and has not been seen in any other sculpture in Mesoamerica. The sculpture with feminine features and life-size, appears decapitated and is made of basalt stone, which does not exist in the region. This was fragmented for ritual purposes, instead of sacrificing an individual it was replaced by the object, in order to promote fertility, as it was placed in a water tank, archaeologists explain.

The Venus of Tamtoc has scarifications in the form of tattoos in high relief, which are observed on the shoulders, breasts and thighs of the sculpture, which refer to the 52 years of the Mesoamerican calendar, as well as the 104-year cycles of the lunar and solar cycle. It is presumed that the sculpture is not of a goddess, but of a priestess, which indicates the importance of women as a bearer of time through menstrual periods.  Arts = Ceramics  The ceramic remains that have been found in Tamtoc speak of elaborate and decorated work. Common use vessels have been found in the houses that have been excavated, as well as offering ceramics in the Great Laguna de Los Patos, and also in funerary offerings. The pieces found are in warehouses under the protection of the INAH, while resources are being sought for the Tamtoc Site Museum.  Sculpture  In Tamtoc, several sculpture workshops have been found in the La Noria area, among which a fragment of a stela of a zoomorphic character stands out, of which only the legs of a human being with the claws of a bird instead of feet can be seen. The sculptural fragment measures approximately one meter high by 1.5 wide and weighs 90 kilos. The lapidary workshops add to the evidence that sculptures of the highest quality were made on the site by highly specialized artists.  Painting  Like all pre-Hispanic cities, the buildings of Tamtoc were also covered with illustrious and colorful murals and paintings. In the Northeast Plaza, remains of murals with red, orange, blue and green colors have been found in some structures.  Culture = Procession of Spirits  For the Teenek community, the Tamtoque has a particular meaning because until the 1930s, the deceased were still buried in this place. Currently, various indigenous communities in the country, mainly Teeneks, meet in Tamtoc in November to hold the event known as the \\"Procession of Spirits.\\" In this event, various dances take place for two days and each group places an offering at the foot of the Tamtoque in memory of their ancestors.  Excavations  Tamtoc is still excavating and finding an endless number of artifacts that are taken to the INAH laboratories in Mexico City, its main promoter has been the Architect Guillermo Ahuja O., who made the work that grow since the beginning of the current century is done on site. The ruins of the city have been investigated, preserved and made available to the public thanks to the Trust for the Archaeological Rescue of Tamtoc, made up of the Fomento Cultural Banamex, AC, the Government of the State of San Luis Potos√≠ and the National Institute of Anthropology and History.

The epithet Qa·π≠raya indicates that he was a native of Beth Qa·π≠raye (Qatar). Arya, the Syriac for lion, is probably a nickname. He was a member of the Church of the East. Gabriel was a relative of Isaac of Nineveh, who became bishop around 680. According to a Syrian Orthodox source, Patriarch Giwargis I (c.659‚Äì680) met Isaac on a visit to Beth Qa·π≠raye and brought him back to Beth Aramaye because Gabriel was active there. This source refers to Gabriel as an \\"interpreter of the church\\". It is probable therefore that Gabriel is the same person as the Gabriel Qa·π≠raya mentioned in the nomocanon of Gabriel of Basra. This work survives only in fragments, but a now lost manuscript from Siirt (no. 67) contained a passage stating that Gabriel had taught at the school of Mahoze in Beth Aramaye and the future patriarchs ·∏§enanisho ø I (686‚Äì700) and Aba II (742‚Äì753) were among his students. Gabriel's writings do not survive, but he is quoted frequently in biblical commentaries of the Church of the East from the 8th century onwards as a recognized authority on both the Old and New Testaments. He is usually cited as Gabriel Qa·π≠raya with the title rabban (teacher), but the Gannat BussƒÅme, quoting ·π¢harbokht bar Msargis, uses both his surnames. As Gabriel Arya, he has an entry in the catalogue of Syriac writers created by  øAbdisho ø of Nisibis around 1300. According to  øAbdisho ø, he wrote a commentary on select passages from the Bible, called Salges mashlmanuta d-·π£urta, the \\"tradition (or transmission) of the scriptural text\\".  øAbdisho ø does not mention his origins, but does note his relationship to Isaac. There were several Gabriels from Beth Qa·π≠raye active in the 7th century, which can cause confusion. Gabriel bar Lipeh, who wrote a commentary on the liturgy, was active early in the century., Baumstark, Scher, Andr√© de Halleux and Lucas Van Rompay are agreed on most points, but de Halleux does not believe that the teacher of Mahoze mentioned by Gabriel of Basra was the relative of Isaac.  øAbdisho ø of Nisibis has a separate entry for a Gabriel Qa·π≠raya who wrote a Discourse on the Union (i.e., the hypostatic union) and Resolution to Questions on the Matter of the Faith. Addai Scher and Carl Anton Baumstark believe this was the same person as Gabriel Arya, but Sebastian Brock argues that he was probably identical to the Gabriel Qa·π≠raya against whom Babai the Great (died 628) directed his Book of Causes and thus lived too early to be identical to Gabriel Arya., mentions the author of the Discourse on the Union active in the 620s, but no other Gabriel.

She participated in one notable single ship action that resulted (many years later) in the Admiralty awarding her crew the Naval General service Medal (NGSM). She was wrecked on 6 March 1811. Career Lieutenant Peter Proctor commissioned Thistle in 1808. On 25 March 1809 the French sloop Fortun√©e arrived in Bermuda, a prize to Thistle. Fortun√©e had been sailing from Guadeloupe to Bordeaux. In late October Thistle sent into Halifax, Nova Scotia the American vessel Susquehanna, Brown, master. Susquehanna had been sailing from Baltimore to Tonningen. On 10 February 1810 Thistle gave chase to a vessel. After seven hours Thistle caught up with her quarry, which hoisted Batavian colours, opened fire, and attempted to ram Thistle. The two vessels exchanged fire for about an hour when the Batavian vessel attempted to sail off. A running engagement ensued. After four hours the Dutch vessel struck. According to Lieutenant Proctor, she was the Batavian naval corvette , of 10 guns, though pierced for 18. She had a crew of 52 men under the command of Lieutenant J. Sterling. Her passengers included the former lieutenant-governor of Batavia, Admiral Buyskes ([ Buijskes]), together with his suite. She was on her way to New York with a part cargo of indigo and spices. Havik had one man killed and seven men badly wounded, one of the wounded being the Admiral. On Thistle, a marine was killed and seven men were wounded, Lieutenant Proctor being one of the wounded. During the initial exchange of fire three of Thistles carronades had been dismounted. According to Dutch sources, Havik, Lieutenant Steelingh, captain, had an estimated burthen of 200‚Äì250 tons. She had been built in Batavia and was on her way to Europe. She was armed with six 3-pounder guns and two 1-pounder swivel guns. (This gave her a broadside of 10 pounds, versus Thistles broadside of 66 pounds.) Her complement consisted of 32 men: 30 crew, and two passengers ‚Äì the Admiral, and his aide. She struck after she had expended all her ammunition. Thistle and Havik arrived at Bermuda on 20 February. Havik arrived at Portsmouth from Bermuda on 14 June 1810. Her cargo was reported to have a value of ¬£40,000.\\"Advertisements & Notices\\". Hampshire Telegraph and Sussex Chronicle etc (Portsmouth, England), 18 June 1810; Issue 558. Lieutenant Proctor was promoted to Commander in May 1810. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the NGSM with clasp \\"Thistle 10 Feby. 1810\\" to any surviving claimants from the action; there were none. Lieutenant George M'Pherson replaced Proctor in June 1810. Thistle carried to London the seaman Robert Jeffrey who in 1807 Commander Warwick Lake of had marooned on Sombrero, Anguilla.\\"AUTHENTIC NARRATIVE OF JEFFERY THE SEAMAN. R. JEFFERY\\". La Belle Assembl√©e; or, Bell's Court and Fashionable Magazine (London, England), [Thursday], 1 August 1811; pg. 105; Issue [XXII]. Loss The government hired Thistle to carry dispatches and the January mail for New York from Falmouth, Cornwall. She sailed on 12 January 1811. Lloyd's List reported that Thistle had been lost on 6 March 1811 near New York, United States with the loss of six of her crew. The mail was saved and delivered to New York on 9 March. The subsequent courtmartial established that the loss was due to the inaccuracy of the chart, which showed incorrect soundings. In all, four men died in attempts to get to shore. The rest were pulled to shore on a line from the beach. Over the next few days some of her stores were salvaged and sold. On 13 March the wreck was sold to a local man for $135. The wreck occurred on Maransquam Beach, about nine leagues south of Sandy Hook.

Spring Bay is part of the incorporated municipality of Malpeque Bay. Overview Spring Bay is a civic address community in Lot 18, along with Baltic, Darnley, Hamilton, Indian River, Malpeque, Sea View, Irishtown, Burlington, Clermont, and Margate. Lot 18 communities‚ÄîSpring Bay, Baltic, Darnley, Fermoy, Hamilton, Indian River, Malpeque, and Sea View are under the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Malpeque Bay, which has its seat in Malpeque Bay. History Lot 18, where Spring Valley is located, was one of the 67 lots surveyed in 1764-1766 by Samuel Holland. Parts of Lot 18‚Äîbetween Bedec the place name in Mi'kmaq, now known as Bedeque, and Malpeque‚Äîare the traditional lands of the MiÍûåkmaq. Acadians also settled in this area in the 17th and 18th centuries. Holland undertook a meticulous survey of Isle St. Jean following the Seven Years' War when Britain claimed the island. At the same time Holland established parishes. Lot 18 is part of St. David's Parish, which covered six townships. right The lots parcelled by Holland were approximately 20,000 acres each. In July 1967, private proprietors were granted these lots in the \\"Great Lottery\\", through which almost the entire land surface of Isle St. Jean was given in exchange for the proprietor settling and developing the land and taking responsibility for its administration with rent-paying tenants‚ÄîEuropean Protestant immigrants. Lot 18 was granted to Lieutenant-Colonel John (Robert) Stewart (Stuart) and Captain William Allanby at that time.Lieutenant Robert (John) Stewart was also listed as owning Lots 26 and 52. Half of Lot 26 was given to Loyalists in 1783. After 1775, the owners of Lot 18 were Robert Stewart, who was the Commissioner of Customs for Jamaica and Allanby, who was the Post Master of the Island of St. John.Island Register proprietors By 1781, one half of Lot 18 was sold for arrears because the rent was not paid. By 1783, a Stewart or Stuart owned half of Lot 18‚ÄîLot 26. The Fermoy School, the first in Spring Bay was built in 1840 and the first tavern, The Black Horse, was built in 1869 by Thomas Tuplin at the crossroads of the Old Town Road and the Irishtown Road. The tavern remained operational until 1890. In 1964 the community created a public space popular for picnics, which included a statue of Tuplin's black stallion at Black Horse Corner. Beginning in the late 2010s, Indian River Farms, began to construct large holding irrigation ponds for potato crops, with \\"raised berms, above ground level\\" that were filled by electric pumps using ground water from \\"multiple low-capacity wells nearby\\". In a July 4, 2019 article in The Guardian, concerns were raised by some Islanders about the way in which large holding ponds in \\"the back country, away from people\\" were circumventing the spirit of the ban on new high-capacity agricultural wells on P.E.I.
