Later, the Orpheus formed the core of the first Bristol Pegasus vectored thrust turbofan used in the Harrier Jump Jet family. Design and development The engine had its genesis in a 1952 request by Teddy Petter of Folland for an engine in the 5,000 pounds (22 kN) class to power a new trainer and lightweight fighter-bomber they were developing. Stanley Hooker, relatively new to the company after an earlier career at Rolls-Royce, took the project under his wing. He delivered a relatively simple and easy to maintain engine, which was put into use in the Folland Gnat, flying in 1955. The Orpheus incorporated the novel feature of a large-diameter shaft for its single spool which then needed only two bearings. The weight savings from deleting a bearing and associated parts listed below gave an engine with a thrust of 5,000 lbf but weighing only 800 lb. Eliminating the usual centre support bearing for the shaft joining the compressor and turbine meant the shaft would whirl, assuming a bowed shape, and damage the engine. Whirling was prevented by using a large diameter tube in place of the usual small diameter shaft. The large-diameter thin-walled tube, more than 8 inches in diameter was stiff enough to raise the whirling speed beyond the engine running range using only two bearings instead of the usual three. Two bearings gave a further advantage: previous engines had also needed a coupling in the shaft to allow for any misalignment between the static parts of the three bearings. With two bearings, the shaft simply followed the straight line between them. So the introduction of the large diameter tube allowed the removal of a bearing, a coupling, the engine's support structure for that bearing together with its lubrication system and cooling air supply. A cannular combustor was used with seven flame tubes. This was a recent development in jet engines and the Orpheus also included the innovation of incorporating the turbine entry duct and its stator vanes into the flame tube outlet, each flame tube providing one seventh of the overall duct. This had two advantages, it simplified the manufacture of a complicated and unreliable component, also the segmented design allowed easier allowance for thermal expansion. Developing a Sea Level Static thrust of , the Orpheus 701 had a 7-stage axial compressor driven by a single stage turbine. In 1957 NATO ran a competition for a light fighter design. All three finalists chose the Bristol Orpheus and as a result a substantial contribution towards the cost of the initial engine development was made available from the Mutual Weapons Development Program. The winner of the competition, the Fiat G.91R and G.91T, used Fiat-built versions of the engine. Other users, mostly trainers, soon followed, including the Fuji T-1, HAL HF-24 Marut, HA-300, and the experimental Hunting H.126 and Short SB5. For later civilian applications, the Orpheus was chosen, after use of two each on the prototypes, as an option on the Lockheed JetStar, Lockheed's Vice President and head of the famous Skunk Works, Clarence \\"Kelly\\" Johnson stating; \\"These Orpheus engines ... have been the best engines the writer has ever used in a prototype aircraft. They were and are so good that it was decided at an early date to make all Jetstars from serial number two up capable of using two Orpheus engines (as an alternative to four American units). The Orpheus version ... is fully competitive in performance (except with one engine out) and will be offered to those who want its lower cost, simplicity, and - at least for some time - reliability\\". Many companies in the 1950s were looking at ways of producing a vertical take off and landing aircraft. Michel Wibault had the idea of using a turboshaft engine to drive four large centrifugal blowers which could be swivelled to vector the thrust. Hooker's engineers decided on using the Orpheus gas generator to drive a single large fan that would supply air to a pair of rotating nozzles, while the exhaust flow from the Orpheus was split into two and would supply another pair of nozzles at the rear of the engine. This experimental system developed into the Pegasus. Licences to produce the Orpheus were obtained by Fiat S.p.A., SNECMA, and - as the TJ37, Curtiss-Wright.

Initially it was only broadcasting for six hours between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m. A few years later, it switched to another transponder, allowing it to broadcast between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Nickelodeon was launched as a free-to-air television channel in Sweden in 2001 and in Finland on 1 September 2007. On 18 June 2008, a separate channel for Sweden was launched. Nickelodeon Sweden replaced the pan-Nordic channel in all of the country. The pan-Nordic does however continue to be available in Denmark, Finland and Norway. A Danish version, Nickelodeon Denmark, was launched in March 2008. It was launched with VH1 Denmark, which aired Nickelodeon for six hours in the morning. The Pan-Nordic version is still available to Danish satellite viewers. In 2011, the channel started broadcasting commercials in Norwegian, despite also being available in Denmark and Finland at the time. On 7 January 2013, Viacom launched a Finnish version of Nick Jr. which replaced Nickelodeon Scandinavia on cable and in the terrestrial network. Nickelodeon Scandinavia continues to be available on satellite in Finland. Broadcast Most cartoons are dubbed into local languages, and separate audio tracks are available on satellite. Non-cartoon series aimed an older audience is broadcast in English with local subtitles. The limited broadcasting hours meant that the channel usually shared bandwidth with other channels who would broadcast in the evening and the night. On Viasat, it used to broadcast on the same channel as Viasat Nature, Viasat Crime and Playboy TV, but this was changed in 2007 when Viasat Nature started broadcasting in the day and Nickelodeon would timeshare with VH1 instead. Many cable systems took the Viasat feed. On Canal Digital, the European version of VH1 Classic is broadcast in the downtime, and on Swedish DTT (Boxer). Star! was once shown during the same time. The channel was previously broadcast from the United Kingdom, but in 2008 it handed back its UK license and started broadcasting from the Netherlands instead.

The band released 2 studio albums along with some singles and EPs over a 10 year career. Career The band formed while at University of Kansas in 1980 and, along with bands like the Embarrassment, and the Mortal Micronotz, they were prominent in the alternative music scene in Lawrence. They released their first record in 1981, which was a flexi disc released with \\"Talk Talk\\" magazine. This was followed by a self-released 4-track EP called Words Move. They had 5 songs on the four band split cassette, released by Fresh Sounds Records, called Fresh Sounds From Middle America (vol 1) (the four bands being Get Smart!, the Embarrassment, the Yard Apes and the Mortal Micronotz). In 1982 they relocated to Chicago, Illinois.

The game was developed by Westwood Studios and published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment for the Super NES and Genesis in 1994, and was also ported to MS-DOS, Amiga, Game Gear, Master System, and Nintendo Entertainment System. The Amiga, Master System, and NES versions were only released in the PAL region, with the NES version in particular being the last game released for the platform in the region in addition to being the final licensed game for the platform worldwide. The game follows Simba's journey from a young cub to the battle with his evil uncle Scar as an adult. Gameplay The Lion King is a side-scrolling platform game in which players control the protagonist, Simba, through the events of the film, going through both child and adult forms as the game progresses. In the first half of the game, players control Simba as a cub, who primarily defeats enemies by jumping on them. Simba also has the ability to roar, using up a replenishable meter, which can be used to stun enemies, make them vulnerable, or solve puzzles. In the second half of the game, Simba becomes an adult and gains access to various combat moves such as scratching, mauling, and throws. In either form, Simba will lose a life if he runs out of health or encounters an instant-death obstacle, such as a bottomless pit or a rolling boulder. Throughout the game, the player can collect various types of bugs to help them through the game. Some bugs restore Simba's health and roar meters, other more rare bugs can increase these meters for the remainder of the game, while black spiders will cause Simba to lose health. By finding certain bugs hidden in certain levels, the player can participate in bonus levels in which they play as Timon and Pumbaa to earn extra lives and continues. Pumbaa's stages have him collecting falling bugs and items until either one hits the bottom of the screen or he eats a bad bug, while Timon's stages have him hunting for bugs within a time limit while avoiding spiders. Development The sprites and backgrounds were drawn by Disney animators themselves at Walt Disney Feature Animation, and the music was adapted from songs and orchestrations in the soundtrack. In a \\"Devs Play\\" session with Double Fine, game designer Louis Castle revealed that two of the game's levels, Hakuna Matata and Be Prepared, were adapted from scenes that were scrapped from the final movie. An Amiga 1200 version of the game was developed with assembly language in two months by Dave Semmons, who was willing to take on the conversion if he received the Genesis source code. He assumed the game to be programmed in 68000 assembly, since the Amiga and Genesis shared the same CPU family developed by Motorola, but turned out to be written in C, a language he was unfamiliar with. Westwood Studios developed the game for SNES, Genesis and Amiga. The development of ports for the other platforms was outsourced to different studios. East Point Software ported the game to MS-DOS, adding enhanced music and sound effects. The Sega Master System and Game Gear versions were developed by Syrox Developments, while the NES and Game Boy versions were developed by Dark Technologies. Rerelease The versions of the game for SNES, Genesis, and Game Boy are included alongside Aladdin in Disney Classics: Aladdin and The Lion King, which released for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows on October 29, 2019. Reception The SNES version of The Lion King sold well, with 1.27 million copies sold in the United States. The Windows version sold over 200,000 copies. In 2002, Westwood's Louis Castle remarked that The Lion King sold roughly 4.5 million copies in total. GamePro gave the SNES version a generally negative review, commenting that the game has outstanding graphics and voices but \\"repetitive, tedious game play that's too daunting for beginning players and too annoying for experienced ones.\\" They particularly noted the imprecise controls and highly uneven difficulty, though they felt the \\"movie-quality graphics, animations, and sounds\\" were good enough to make the game worth playing regardless of the gameplay. They similarly remarked of the Genesis version, \\"The Lion King looks good and sounds great, but the game play needs a little more fine-tuning ...\\" The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the Game Gear version as having graphics equal to the SNES and Genesis versions and controls that are vastly improved over those versions. They scored the game a 7.75 out of 10 average. GamePro wrote that the graphics are not as good as those of the SNES and Genesis versions, but agreed that they are exceptional by Game Gear standards, and praised the Game Gear version for having a much more gradual difficulty slope than the earlier versions. Gameplayers wrote in their November 1994 issue that \\"even on the easy setting, the game is hard for an experienced player\\". Next Generation reviewed the SNES version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"even though the game is much harder than Aladdin, it's never unfair or frustrating.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave the Super NES version an A and the Genesis version a B+ and wrote that \\"Controlling Simba when he's a playful bundle of fur is one thing; putting him through his paces as a full-maned adult is quite another. When the grown-up Simba gives a blood-curdling roar and mauls snarling hyenas, the interaction is so well observed that it's like watching a PBS nature documentary. The sense of power it gives you is exhilarating, and by the time Simba takes his climactic heavyweight stand against his evil uncle Scar, this Lion King has turned into a wild-kingdom variant of Street Fighter II.\\" Super Play gave the Super NES version an overall score of 82/100 praising the game‚Äôs graphics and sound as ‚Äúalmost film-like quality‚Äù and stating ‚Äúa very high-quality platformer game with little in the way of innovation.‚Äù See also *List of Disney video games NotesReferencesExternal links * Category:The Lion King video games Category:1994 video games Category:Amiga games Category:DOS games Category:Game Boy games Category:Sega Game Gear games Category:Mobile games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Platform games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Master System games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Virgin Interactive games Category:Westwood Studios games Category:Video games set in Africa Category:Amiga 1200 games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble Category:Video games scored by Frank Klepacki Category:Single-player video games ","title":"The Lion King (video game)"},{"id":"3809487","text":"Main entrance to the church. The church's interior showing the nave, altar and stained glass windows prior to the renovation, showing the lack of reredos and bare sanctuary. The Church of Saints Peter and Paul (Chinese: Âú£‰ºØÂ§öÁ¶ÑÂú£‰øùÁ¶ÑÂ†Ç) is a Roman Catholic church in Singapore. It is located at Queen Street within the Central Area known as the Bras Basah Bugis precinct of Singapore's arts district. History and architecture The history of the Church of Saints Peter and Paul is closely linked with the beginning and growth of the Chinese Catholic community in Singapore. The church, with its tower, was constructed between 1869 and 1870. It was erected by the Chinese Catholic Mission serving a congregation of all the Chinese dialect groups and their Indian brethren. It was also a centre for many European missionaries who needed to learn the Chinese language before other postings. Initially, the Chinese Catholic community had contributed to the building of the first permanent Roman Catholic house of worship along Bras Basah Road. With a fifth of the construction cost borne by them, the chapel was ready by 1833. However, by the end of the 1830s, the chapel had become too small. Instead of enlarging the chapel, work was begun on the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd nearby and Saint Joseph's Institution took over the chapel's premises. With the development of the apostolate among the Chinese and the Indians under Father Pierre Paris, it became increasingly difficult to accommodate the different linguistic groups in the Cathedral. By the late 1860s, a new church was needed and the Church of Saints Peter and Paul was erected. It is said that the cost of the compound wall of the church was defrayed by Napoleon III of France. The church was smaller then, with only seven pairs of columns. In 1883, Father Paris bestowed the three bells, which are still in use today, but the state of his health prevented him from being present when the bells were blessed. He also initiated construction of the spire. Father Paris died on 23 May 1883, after having worked in the Straits for over 28 years and is buried in the church. Father Ludovic Jules Galmel, who had taken over from Father Paris during his illness, completed the spire and built the presbytery. As he spoke no Tamil, another priest became his assistant to minister to the Indian congregation. When the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes in Ophir Road was built in 1888, the Indian congregation moved there. The Church of Saints Peter and Paul then became an exclusively Chinese parish under Father Alphonse Vignol, concentrating on the different Chinese dialect groups. From 1891 to 1892, the church was enlarged when the sacristy and transept were added. Father Vignol also erected three marble altars whereby the High Altar in the new sanctuary was consecrated by Bishop Edouard Gasnier. From 1910 to 1911, the church was further extended with the enlargement of the choir loft, construction of the entrance porch and the extension of the fa√ßade with the help of contributions from wealthy Chinese parishioners such as Mr Low Gek Seng, a manager of the Bangkok and Singapore-based merchant firm Kiam Hoa Heng. These altars (including the high altar) no longer exist, as they were demolished in the renovations of 1970, which came in the period of confusion following the Second Vatican Council, where many well-meaning church members and clergy oversaw the unnecessary 'modernisation' with beautiful buildings scarred. In 1910, the Cantonese- and Hakka-speaking groups left Saints Peter and Paul for the new Church of the Sacred Heart in Tank Road built by Father Vincent Gazeau. In 1929, the Hoklo people left for the new Church of Saint Teresa in Kampong Bahru. The last two churches were financed by wealthy Chinese parishioners particularly Mr Jacobe Low Kiok Chiang (1843‚Äì1911) and Mr Chan Teck Hee, both founders of the firm Kiam Hoa Heng. Mr Wee Cheng Soon (d. 1944), a wealthy contractor and property developer and Mr Chan Teck Hee, also defrayed almost all of the costs of the Church of St Theresa. A major renovation of the church was planned for its centenary year and in October 1969, with the help of the Church Renovation Committee, the parishioners and other well-wishers, renovations were completed in time for the Centenary Celebrations in June and July 1970. It was during this major renovation that the original neo-gothic high altar was demolished, and replaced with a modern 'communion table' style altar, similar to what one would find in a Protestant church, without a reredos, and no visually obvious crucifix or candles, with the stained glass windows becoming the visual focal point instead. (these issues were addressed in the most recent restoration when the 1969 wreckovation was mostly undone.) There was once a pipe organ installed by Parisian organ builder Aristide Cavaill√©-Coll in this church. It was built in 1877 and was of modest dimensions, costing 5939.75 francs. This orgue de choeur was dismantled and discarded in the 1960s and no trace of it remains. The old wooden pews have also had their fleur-de-lis decorations removed. In early 2008, the church installed a second-hand 50 stops Allen 2 Manual Digital Computer Organ in the Choir Loft. The parish of the Church of Saints Peter and Paul grew marginally in the 1970s but began to decline since the 1980s when schools within its vicinity were relocated. With the completion of new churches in the various housing estates and the demarcation of parish boundaries, many parishioners have since left for their new parishes located nearer to their homes. The Church of Saints Peter and Paul was gazetted a national monument on 10 February 2003. From 4 September to 12 November 2006, the church was one of the exhibition venues for the Singapore Biennale, Singapore's inaugural international biennale of contemporary art. Currently, the church is under the care of the Discalced Carmelite Friars. All masses are usually in English with a Mandarin service on Sunday mornings and a Cantonese service on Sunday afternoons. Most recently, the church underwent a major renovation and restoration, which was completed in 2016. Apart from addressing necessary repairs to the fabric, the renovation also reinstated several features of the original church, such as ornate encaustic tiles, similar to the ones removed in the late 1960s. Besides repairing the aging roof structure and other technical improvements such as lighting and air conditioning, many of the changes introduced in the 1970s renovation were reversed: the modern sheet metal vertical window louvres were replaced with traditional wooden louvred windows, the badly-planned gallery at the west end was removed, and a high altar, similar to the one that was demolished, has been purchased and re- installed at the east end. Following this renovation, the church became the recipient of the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore's Architectural heritage award in 2016.https://www.ura.gov.sg/uol/conservation/participate/aha/about-aha.aspx See also *Saint Peter *Saint Paul of Tarsus * Christianity in Singapore *Roman Catholicism in Singapore * Archdiocese of Singapore * List of Roman Catholic churches in Singapore  References  Bibliography: *Norman Edwards, Peter Keys (1988), Singapore ‚Äì A Guide to Buildings, Streets, Places, Times Books International, *Eugene Wijeysingha (2006), Going Forth... ‚Äì The Catholic Church in Singapore 1819‚Äì2004, Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop of Singapore, *Wan Meng Hao (2005), Know Our Monuments , Preservation of Monuments Board External links *Official Website of the Church of Saints Peter and Paul *Parish information of the Church of Saints Peter and Paul *Singapore Catholic Church Directory Peter and Paul Category:Churches in Singapore Category:Landmarks in Singapore Category:National monuments of Singapore Category:Churches completed in 1870 Category:19th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:Rochor ","title":"Church of Saints Peter and Paul, Singapore"},{"id":"3809495","text":"KHTP (103.7 MHz, \\"Hot 103.7\\"), is a commercial FM radio station in Seattle. The station is owned and operated by Entercom Communications and it airs a classic hip-hop radio format. The studios and offices are on Fifth Avenue in Downtown Seattle. KHTP's transmitting antenna is on Tiger Mountain in Issaquah. It broadcasts in the HD Radio format, carrying an adult album alternative (AAA) format on its HD2 subchannel. KHTP's signal also heard on FM translator K281AD 104.1 MHz in Olympia. History=Early Years On June 2, 1958, the station first signed on as KTWR, originally on 103.9 MHz.Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page A-249 It was owned by Thomas Wilmot Read (hence the call sign) and was powered at only 830 watts, a fraction of its current output. The signal was limited to the area in and around Tacoma, not the larger Seattle radio market. In 1964, the station was acquired by Tacoma Broadcasters, Inc, which already owned KTAC (now KHHO).Broadcasting Yearbook 1965 page B-168 Tacoma Broadcasters changed the call letters to KTAC-FM to simulcast KTAC. A few years later, the FM station began running separate programming, with an automated Top 40 format. Beautiful \\"K-Bird\\" Entercom bought KTAC-AM-FM in June 1973.Broadcasting Yearbook 1975 page C-206 In 1977, the FM call letters were changed to KBRD, as Entercom flipped the station to a beautiful music format as \\"K-Bird FM 104.\\" KBRD upgraded to a stronger signal at 103.7 FM in 1979. The station went from less than 930 watts, 1 kW ERP, to a new diesel fueled power generator and the output of the transmitter at 63,000 watts, boosted 100 kW. ERP by a complicated additive antenna array that was noisy. A former operations manager, Claude Rorabaugh, had trouble keeping the remote transmitter on-air along with the station engineer and the station ran more time at 1 kW than full power. He quit in the spring of 1980. Overall, it was able to hit the larger Seattle market, although with some signal issues in the downtown area and its northern suburbs just north of Lynnwood. Ratings were good for several years, but by the end of the 1980s, the audience for easy listening stations was aging. Adult Alternative \\"The Mountain\\" At 2 p.m. on April 10, 1991, KBRD flipped to a long running adult album alternative (AAA) format as \\"FM 104 The Mountain\\" and the KMTT call sign. The first song on \\"The Mountain\\" was \\"Rock Me on the Water\\" by Jackson Browne. The former KBRD call letters are now on 680 AM in Lacey. The station did have some ratings issues for the first couple of years due to its transmitter location south of Tacoma. This was changed when the transmitter relocated to Tiger Mountain in Issaquah, amid the towers for other Seattle area TV and FM stations. KMTT, while it was never #1 in Arbitron ratings books, did well with affluent adult demographics. It was the Seattle market's third attempt at a AAA format dating back to 1975-1983 as KZAM FM 92.5 (now KQMV) and 1983-1990 as KEZX FM 98.9 (now KNUC). However, as time went on, the station saw a decline in ratings, especially after the introduction of the Portable People Meter in the Seattle market in 2009. KMTT featured several different morning drive time shows. The Mountain was the home of John Fisher & Peyton Mays, Fisher & Gary Crow, Crow & Mike West, and Fisher & West. The Marty Riemer & Jodi Brothers morning show were dismissed in September 2009, and were replaced by Sean Demery (formerly of 99X in Atlanta), until he was released in early 2011. A short time later, Reimer returned to the station to host afternoon drive. Shift to Classic Rock In late 2011, Shawn Stewart left KMTT, as the station shifted to a more classic rock direction, but still retaining AAA artists. Stewart began hosting It's Raining Cats & Dogs on Bonneville International-owned KIRO-FM. In the Fall of 2012, KMTT shifted its format to \\"A Mountain of Classics,\\" featuring adult rock hits from the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, in hopes to better compete against classic rock-formatted KZOK. Reimer again left the station on December 20, 2012. Ultimately, the \\"Mountain of Classics\\" direction did not find enough of an audience. Hot 103.7 On August 30, 2013, at 1:50 p.m., after playing \\"If You Leave\\" by OMD, KMTT began stunting with a loop of \\"It's The End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\\" by R.E.M. until 3:00 p.m., when the station flipped to Rhythmic AC, branded as \\"Hot 103.7.\\" The first song on \\"Hot\\" was \\"Blurred Lines\\" by Robin Thicke featuring T.I. and Pharrell. The Mountain's AAA format was moved onto the station's HD2 subchannel. Two weeks later, on September 11, 2013, KMTT changed its call letters to KHTP. Concurrently, the KMTT call sign was moved to co-owned AM 910 in Portland (formerly KKSN). KHTP experienced immediate ratings success with its new format; in its first full book as \\"Hot\\" in October, the station jumped to a 4.8 share. On December 4, 2013, Entercom announced that \\"Candy & Potter,\\" former morning show hosts at KBKS-FM, would join the station for mornings beginning January 22, 2014. (The pair were released in March 2015). Kristin the Island Girl, former midday personality on KBKS, began hosting middays at KHTP on that day as well. On June 27, 2017, Entercom announced that recording artist and Seattle native Sir Mix-a-Lot would host mornings on the station beginning July 5. In addition, Eric Powers, long-time afternoon host and program director at KUBE, was also named KHTP's new PD and would also begin hosting afternoons on the same day. (Mike Preston, KHTP's PD since the station's 2013 inception, and former longtime PD at KBKS, left the station in February 2017.) With the change, morning host Deanna Cruz exited, and afternoon host/APD Tanch moved to middays. Kristin the Island Girl left the station as well. On August 30, 2018, former KSFM on-air host and MD Bre Ruiz was named co-host for the Sir Mix-a-Lot morning show effective September 4. Sir Mix-a-Lot exited the station on June 28, 2019, after nearly two years with the station. TranslatorHD radio KMTT launched HD Radio operations in 2006. 103.7-HD2 carried a blues format. In March 2012, 103.7-2 flipped to a format focusing on \\"Mountain Music Discovery.\\" It featured music from Adult Album Alternative artists new and old, with exclusive live songs from The Mountain's own archives. The blues format moved for a time to sister station KKWF 100.7-HD2. In February 2013, the HD2 subchannel was branded \\"The Original Mountain.\\" As of August 30, 2013, with the change in format on KMTT, the HD2 channel was renamed \\"103.7 HD2 The Mountain Seattle,\\" as the two formats from analog/HD1 and HD2 merged. HD Radio Guide for Seattle-Tacoma Live from the Mountain Music Lounge As part of its \\"Mountain\\" format, the former KMTT hosted live musical performances in the Mountain Music Lounge, a small, intimate stage setting. Artists were invited to play small sets of songs, all of which are recorded by the station. In 1995, KMTT published On the Mountain: Collector's Edition of Live Performances, a compilation of live tracks from artists including BoDeans, Shawn Colvin, and Big Head Todd and the Monsters that sold through local Seattle retailers. With the success of the first album, the station carried on an annual release of collections, eventually renaming the series Live from the Mountain Music Lounge with the ninth volume. Portions of the proceeds from sales of the various albums were donated in support of The Wilderness Society. KHTP-HD2 plays recorded performances from The Mountain Archives, both those issued on the CDs and other songs from various sets, on its rebranded HD2 station, \\"The Mountain Seattle.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Hot 103.7 * * HTP Category:Classic hip-hop radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1964 Category:Entercom radio stations ","title":"KHTP"},{"id":"3809497","text":"Alexander Johnstone (31 July 1961 ‚Äì 7 December 2016) was a Scottish Conservative and Unionist politician, and Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for North East Scotland from 1999 until his death in 2016.

The firm has been a supplier to every British monarch since the coronation of King George III in 1761. Today, Justerini & Brooks sells to private collectors based in 49 different countries, as well as a number of hotels and restaurants across the United Kingdom. The company is known for its extensive fine wine portfolio, and represents many of the world's leading winemakers and chateaux, including Ch√¢teau P√©trus and Ch√¢teau Lafleur in Bordeaux, Comte Liger Belair, Marquis d‚ÄôAngerville, and Domaines Roumier, Mugnier, Bruno Clair, Leroy, Rousseau, Rouget, Coche Dury amongst others in Burgundy. Didier Dagueneau in the Loire, Domaine Chave and Ch√™ne Bleu in the Rh√¥ne, Weingut Joh. Jos. Pr√ºm in Germany as well as Altare, Roagna, Voerzio and Azelia in Barolo. The firm is known for creating and developing its blended house whisky, J&B; Rare. Justerini & Brooks is owned by multinational Diageo plc.  History = Early years  In 1749, Giacomo Justerini (or Giustarini) from Bologna, fell in love with a soprano and followed her to London, bringing with him a number of recipes for liqueurs created by his father, who was a distiller. He met an English investor, George Johnson, and together they founded the wine merchants Johnson & Justerini. In 1760, Justerini returned to his native land after selling the business to Johnson. Johnson continued to grow the business, naming his grandson, Augustus, as a partner, and building relationships with European suppliers from Bordeaux, Cadiz, Mayence, Reims, Genoa, Dijon and Palermo. Justerini & Brooks crest The next year, King George III honoured the firm with its first Royal Warrant, which has been granted by eight consecutive British Monarchs since that date. George Johnson was killed by a runaway horse colliding with his sedan chair in Piccadilly in 1785, while returning from a lunch with the Duke of Queensberry, leaving Augustus Johnson solely in charge of the company. In 1790, Johnson & Justerini's offices suffered major damage by a fire in the adjoining opera house‚ÄîHer Majesty's Theatre. Augustus Johnson's son, Augustus II, is made a partner in recognition of his efforts to extinguish the flames.  1800‚Äì2000  When King George III died in 1820, Augustus Johnson II continued stocking the royal cellars, often delivering up to seven wagon-loads of liquor at a time. In 1831, Johnson sold the business to Alfred Brooks. A gentleman of means - it was said that his St John's Wood gardens were sufficiently large to include a snipe shoot. The firm was renamed Justerini & Brooks, and its headquarters were established in Regent's Park. Charles Dickens was an early customer. When Queen Victoria was declared Empress of India in 1858, Justerini & Brooks immediately saw a commercial opportunity and began selling to many of the country's reigning Princes and Maharajahs. Furthering its international expansion, Justerini & Brooks opened a New York office in 1866. In 1876, Alfred Brooks handed the company over to his son-in-law, William Cole. Cole laid down large stocks of young wines, seeing them as essential to the business' success. Seeing the potential of blended whisky, J&B; was one of the first London spirits merchants to buy up stocks of mature malt whisky and create its own \\"house\\" blend. This was named Club. William Cole sold Justerini & Brooks to Anderson & Newbiggin in 1889, shortly before his death. The company began selling a specially curated Champagne, 'Sarcey', to King Edward VII in 1908. In 1914, the firm debuted its cellarage service for its private collectors. Justerini & Brooks now stores circa ¬£200 million of its customers reserves, which is held with Cellarers at Octavian's warehouse in Corsham, Wiltshire. During Prohibition, Justerini & Brooks was promoting a brand they had created specifically for the American market, J&B; Rare, and when Prohibition came to an end in 1933, their activities began to pay dividends in and around New York City. During World War II, pre-war wine prices inflated 20 times over, but J&B; continued to sell bottles at 1939 prices as a gesture of goodwill and solidarity. In 1976 Justerini & Brooks' managing director Geoffrey Jameson opened up the Hong Kong wine market with a series of lavish dinners held at both the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and the Peninsula hotel. A focus on Singapore followed in 1980s, which has continued to the present day. Justerini & Brooks launched the charity conservation programme \\"J&B; Care for the Rare\\" in 1992, an international initiative to save rare species from extinction. It is now involved with Prince William's conservation charity Tusk Trust.  2001‚Äìpresent  In 2001, J&B; became the exclusive agent for Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair in the UK and Singapore. In 2008, Hew Blair became J&B; chairman, having joined the business in 1974, and being the buying director since 1982. In 2011 Hew Blair was appointed President of the Royal Warrant Holders Association and earned a seat on the Buckingham Palace Wine Committee. In 2012, Chadwick Delaney became managing director of Justerini & Brooks, having been Sales Director since 2003. In 2014, Justerini & Brooks became UK distributors for both Chateau Lafleur and Petrus.

Wine and spirits  Justerini & Brooks whisky bottle Justerini & Brooks are known for their selection of fine wines, as well as for their J&B; Rare blended whisky brand.  Fine wines  Justerini & Brooks are an importer of domaine- bottled fine wines from Burgundy, Barolo and Germany into the UK.Andrew Ellson, Roll out the riesling, German wines are making a comeback, in: The Times dated 9 December 2019 As well as having long-standing relationships with the finest properties in Bordeaux, the Rh√¥ne, the Loire and Champagne. Justerini & Brooks' fine wine list includes wines from all over the world. Old World wines include Alsace, Beaujolais, Bordeaux, Burgundy, Loire, and Rhone. New World varieties include wines from Australia, New Zealand, California, Argentina, Chile, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.  Whiskies  J&B; Rare Blend, the blended scotch whisky brand, is a blend of forty-two malt and grain whiskies. It has an ABV of 40%. It includes the single malts Knockando, Auchroisk and Glen Spey.  Polo  Justerini & Brooks' current heritage with the sport dates back to the 1980s, when they simultaneously launched their involvement in England, and also in India. In India, Justerini & Brooks launched the ‚ÄòJ&B; Baroda Cup‚Äô in Delhi - an international 12-goal event. The J&B; Baroda Cup was the first time that sponsorship had been introduced to the game of polo in India, which until then had been regarded as a military sport. Justerinis & Brooks' title endorsement, alongside that of a small group of highly distinguished influencers, brought the sport to increased eminence in Delhi, and polo in India became increasingly synonymous with luxury amongst an international elite. During the same period back in the UK, Justerini & Brooks sponsored the J&B; Pro International polo tournament, with a J&B; polo team captained by James Lucas - HRH Prince Harry's former coach, and which he took to victory in 1992. The company's involvement in polo continues. It is the global wine partner to British Polo Day, supporting their exhibitions that tour the world annually - visiting countries that include France, Germany, India, China, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Australia, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and the USA. Justerini & Brooks also continues to support polo in the UK with its partnership at the Beaufort Polo Club in Gloucestershire, sponsoring both its high goal tournaments, the Prince of Wales Cup and the Arthur Lucas Cup.  Location  When Giacomo Justerini and George Johnson founded the company in 1749, they set up their offices at Number 2 Pall Mall, in the St James's area of London's City of Westminster. The business remained at this location for over 200 years, surviving damage from two fires at the adjoining opera house, Her Majesty's Theatre. In 1954, 205 years after it was founded, Justerini & Brooks moved out of Pall Mall to set up an office in Bond Street, with a second office in Holborn Viaduct. 15 years later, in 1969, Justerini & Brooks relocated once more, with the wine side of the business moving to St James's Street, close to where the business was founded. The whisk ~~e~~ y side of the company moved to York Gate, Regent's Park.

Cross was Maine's 61st and 63rd Governor, though his two terms were separated by just 25 hours. Biography Born in Gardiner, Maine on November 15, 1902, Cross graduated from Augusta's Cony High School in 1920, and became a florist in Augusta. In 1933, Cross won a seat on the Augusta Common Council and in 1937 he was elected to the Board of Aldermen, and he served as presiding officer of both bodies. He won a seat in the Maine House of Representatives in 1941, where he served two terms before winning election to the Maine Senate in 1945. He became majority floor leader in 1947 and served as President of the Senate from 1949 to 1952. In 1952, Cross won the Republican nomination for Governor and went on to defeat Democrat James Oliver in the general election by a substantial margin. Cross actually became Governor about two weeks prior to the start of his elected term of office when Governor Frederick G. Payne resigned on December 25, 1952 to prepare for his upcoming term in the United States Senate; Cross, as President of the Senate became Governor through constitutional succession. Cross' term as Senate President (and Governor) expired at 10:00am on January 7, 1953, allowing Senator Nathaniel M. Haskell as the newly elected president of the Senate to serve as governor for 25 hours. At 11:00am on January 8, 1953, Cross' official elected term of office began During Cross's term, the state highway commission was reorganized under a full time commissioner, and the state finance office was modernized and brought under closer control of the governor. The state liquor commission was also restructured, following a controversy in which commissioners and employees were accused of accepting bribes from distributors in exchange for carrying certain brands at state- owned liquor stores. Cross also caused dissension in Republican ranks with some of his appointments, including naming an attorney who was a political supporter to the superior court and then to the state supreme court, passing over judges then currently serving on lower courts, and appointing another supporter with minimal law enforcement experience to fill a vacant sheriff's position ahead of the candidate preferred by the party and the voters of the county. Although personally exonerated in the liquor scandal, a politically wounded Cross was defeated in his reelection bid in 1954 by Democratic challenger, Edmund S. Muskie, by over 20,000 votes. Cross never sought public office again but returned to private life as an insurance and stock broker until his retirement in 1971. Death and burial Cross died in Augusta on October 22, 1998; he was buried at Forest Grove Cemetery in Augusta. Family Cross was married to Olena R. Moulton; they were the parents of two children. Legacy In 2001, after major renovations, the Maine State Office Building was dedicated to Cross. A plaque in his honor is located in the second floor lobby.

Brereton, MA, Prebendary of Exeter and Rector of West Buckland. In grateful acknowledgement of the genius that planned and of the liberality energy and judgement that effected the establishment of the Devon County School this bust was presented to the school by Hugh, Earl Fortescue KG 1861\\" Prebendary Joseph Lloyd Brereton, (19 October 1822 ‚Äì 15 August 1901), was a British clergyman, educational reformer and writer, who founded inexpensive schools for the education of the middle classes. Through his work and writings he influenced others to make similar foundations. Life Brereton was born on 19 October 1822 at Little Massingham Rectory, near King's Lynn. He was third son of eleven children of Charles David Brereton (1790‚Äì1868), for forty-seven years rector of Little Massingham, by his wife Frances (1796‚Äì1880), daughter of Joseph Wilson of Highbury Hill, Middlesex, and Stowlangtoft Hall, Suffolk. The father was an influential writer on poor law and agricultural questions between 1825 and 1828. Brereton's youngest brother, Robert Maitland Brereton, became a railway and civil engineer. Brereton was educated at Islington proprietary school under Dr. John Jackson, afterwards bishop of London, and at Rugby under Dr. Thomas Arnold (1838‚Äì41). He gained a scholarship at University College, Oxford, in 1842, obtained the Newdigate prize for a poem on the Battle of the Nile in 1844, and graduated B.A. in 1846 and M.A. in 1857. During his university education he was granted leave on account of illness. It was during this time he started employment as a private tutor with wealthy families, a practice he continued for many years. Taking holy orders, Brereton held curacies at St. Edmund's in Norwich, St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, and St. James's, Paddington (1847‚Äì50). While in London and with the help from his family, he edited a quarterly journal, The Anglo Saxon, which contained articles celebrating English culture and history for consumption in England and throughout the English speaking world. The popular author, Martin Farquhar Tupper was a frequent contributor. The journal promoted and reported on the grand celebration held on 25 October 1849 at Wantage of the millennium of the birth of Alfred the Great. From 1852 to 1867 Brereton was rector of West Buckland, Devon, and in 1867 he took over from his father as rector of Little Massingham, where he remained for the rest of his life. In 1882 Brereton, with his brother, General John Alfred Brereton, was severely injured in a railway accident between Cambridge and Ely, which interrupted for some years his public work. On 25 June 1852 Brereton married Frances, daughter of William Martin, rector of Staverton, Devon, and they had five sons and six daughters. Brereton died on 15 August 1901, and was buried in Little Massingham churchyard. Educational reform Brereton's interest in educational reform among the agricultural and middle classes was stimulated by his father's studies of the Poor Laws and also by the influence of Dr. Arnold at Rugby School. Having been appointed rector of West Buckland in North Devon, with the encouragement and practical assistance of Hugh Fortescue, 2nd Earl Fortescue (d.1861), KG, lord-lieutenant of Devonshire, and his son Viscount Ebrington (d.1905), Brereton established in 1858 at West Buckland the farm and county school to supply education suitable for farmers' sons. Earl Fortescue owned much land in the parish but was not patron of the living, and therefore not responsible for Brereton's appointment. The Earl founded at the same time Filleigh School, near his mansion of Castle Hill, Filleigh.Per inscription on north front of Filleigh School The school was soon renamed the \\"Devon County School\\", and in 1912 was renamed \\"West Buckland School\\". The object was to provide a fee-paying boarding school, with liberal and religious education, at fees which whilst large enough to cover the cost of board and tuition and to return a fair interest on capital invested, were at a fraction of what was charged by the public schools. In recognition of his work in Devon, in 1858 Brereton was made prebendary of Exeter Cathedral. In contrast to the work of Nathaniel Woodard, who also founded schools for the middle classes, Brereton's foundations were not high church. Indeed, although religious instruction and worship were part of the curriculum at Brereton's schools the low church approach was less discouraging to non-conformist elements of the middle classes. Secondly, the main feature of the scheme was that the county rather than the diocese should be the unit of the area of organisation, and that upon the county basis the whole scheme of national education should be co- ordinated. Finally, Brereton did not rely wholly on endowments as did Woodard, but he operated mainly on a proprietary basis, forming companies of investors to raise the capital needed to found his schools. Architects' plan for the Norfolk County School Brereton's removal to Little Massingham in 1867 as rector led in 1871 to the foundation there of the Norfolk County School, which was transferred in 1874 to North Elmham. His next step was to connect the county school system with the universities. After an unsuccessful attempt at Oxford, he founded at Cambridge in 1873 a 'county' college, which was named Cavendish College, after the chancellor of the university, the Duke of Devonshire. Brereton described his scheme in his book County Education. Cavendish College was instituted as a public hostel of the university, students in residence being eligible for a university degree. The undergraduates were younger than was customary, and the cost of board and tuition, which was covered by an inclusive charge of eighty guineas a year, was much lower than in the established colleges. The venture received educational and ecclesiastical support. However, the proprietary principle was not welcomed by some, and the public schools withheld their recognition. Other factors were the distance of the college from the centre of Cambridge, (more than 1 mile), and inferior accommodation. The scheme proved financially unsuccessful, and the college was dissolved in 1892. The buildings were sold in 1895 and were used as a training college, Homerton College, for women teachers, which in 2010 finally became a full college of Cambridge University. In 1881, Brereton formed the Graduated County Schools Association, whose aim was the establishment of self-supporting schools and colleges for girls and women, the last step in his practical scheme for a national system of county education. The association collapsed in 1887 leaving Brereton with large debts. A contributing factor in the failure of some of his schools was the agricultural depression in the 1880s and the competition which arose as a result of the increasing responsibility for secondary education being assumed by counties, e.g. the Free Education Act of 1891 provided some access to low cost secondary education. A key feature of all Brereton's schemes was the proprietary principle. Significant foundation funds were to be raised from investors arather than from charitable endowments. In the end this was a millstone too great for some schools to sustain in times of hard competition. Rural affairs and railways Brereton was interested in agricultural questions, and while in Devon founded in 1854 the Barnstaple Farmers' Club, of which he was president. Later he was president of the west Norfolk chamber of agriculture. In north Devon his interest in rural prosperity was marked by many permanent works of reform and improvement, and by his efforts he helped to bring the railway from Taunton to Barnstaple, a line known as the Devon and Somerset Railway and afterwards absorbed into the Great Western Railway. Similar efforts in west Norfolk led to the Lynn and Fakenham Railway, which was subsequently extended to Norwich, Cromer, and Yarmouth. George Richmond R.A. Portraits A portrait of Brereton as a boy with his maternal grandfather, Joseph Wilson, was painted by Sir David Wilkie. A second portrait, by George Richmond, R.A., with a companion portrait of his wife, was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1868; both are now at West Buckland School, where there is also a bust of Brereton was placed there in 1861 by Hugh, Earl Fortescue.

Hanomag first achieved international fame by delivering numerous steam locomotives to Finland, Romania and Bulgaria before World War I and making of first tractor Hanomag R26 in 1924 in Germany. In 1925, they added automobiles to their line, additionally moving in 1931 into the production of construction machinery. Since 1989, the company has been part of the Komatsu company. History Hanomag Railway Engine built in 1932 The company dates back to 1835 when Georg Egestorff founded in Linden near Hanover a company called Eisen-Giesserey und Maschinenfabrik Georg Egestorff to build small steam engines. They soon started making farm machinery and in 1846 built their first railway locomotive for the Royal Hanoverian State Railways. By 1870 they had made 500 locomotives and in 1871 changed their name to Hannoversche Maschinenbau Actien-Gesellschaft vorm. Georg Egestorff, Linden vor Hannover. Road vehicles followed when in 1905 they received a contract for steam waggons for the German army. Tractors thumb 1946 thumb In 1912 Hanomag started the production of plows with up to 80 hp benzene engines. In 1924, the first farm tractor WD 26 (WD) with a 26 hp four-cylinder benzene engine was presented to the market. In 1931, the first diesel tractor RD 36 with a 36-horsepower four-cylinder engine, and 5.2 liters of capacity was made. Hanomag was the market leader in 1939 and the early 1950s. In 1951, a series of new tractors were developed, based on a modular system with 2-3- and 4-cylinder engines. From 1962 until the cessation of production in 1971, only four-stroke diesel tractors were built. From 1912 to 1971, more than 250,000 machines from 12 to 92 hp left the factory halls in Linden. In addition, there were manufacturing facilities in Argentina and license agreements with the Spanish industrialists. Cars Hanomag 2/10PS \\"Kommissbrot\\" Hanomag 1.5 Litre \\"Rekord\\" By the 1920s, the market for steam road vehicles was in terminal decline, and Hanomag looked to cars as the future, particularly economy models. In 1925, they launched the Hanomag 2/10, a open two-seater with a mid-mounted 500ccG.N. Georgano Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886-1930. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985) single-cylinder water-cooled engine. Named Zweisitzer Limousine (two-seat limousine)G.N. Georgano. by the company, its rounded front and rear gained it the nickname Kommissbrot for its resemblance to a loaf of Army bread. Although made in large numbers, 15,775 in total, it did not make much money for the company and in the late 1920s the railway locomotive division was sold to Henschel & Son of Kassel. A more conventional car, the 3/16PS, and the first diesel engined tractors, came in 1928, taking the company back into profit. Hanomag were badly hurt by the drop in trade in 1929 and built a large stock of unsold vehicles. Things improved in 1930 and the company got 14 per cent of the domestic car market, second place behind Opel, but in 1931 a new crisis came when the banks called in a loan. The factory was mortgaged to Hannover City and the Vereinigte Stahlwerke trust and the company relaunched as Hanomag Automobil und Schlepperbau GmbH. For 1932, a new small car, the 1.1 Litre, renamed the Garant in 1934, was announced and sold well, allowing two-shift working to be introduced and it was joined by the larger 1.5 litre Rekord (a name later used by Opel) in 1933, with independent front suspension. A diesel Rekord was shown at the 1936 Berlin Motor Show. The Hanomag 1.3 litre was introduced in 1939 and had unitary body, an innovative feature for that time. It was studied by Volvo engineers and influenced the construction of the Volvo PV 444 passenger car. Military vehicles During World War II, the car plant made military vehicle engines, a military version of their heavy tractor renamed the SS-100, and half track troop carriers. The Hanomag 20 B, a four-wheel-drive Small Unit-Personnel Carrier was produced from 1937 until 1940 (circa 2000 built) under the parentage of Stoewer (as the R180, R200 and Type 40). Capacity problems by Stoewer resulted in co-production by both BMW (as the 325) and Hanomag. Together, the three manufacturers made about 10,000 units. The special four- wheel-steering system was fitted on most models. Operating a \\"lock-level\\" between the front seats, made the steerable rear axle turn sideways to a certain angle. The single most important and iconic military vehicle to be designed and built by Hanomag during World War II was the Sd.Kfz. 251 half- track (commonly called simply \\"the Hanomag\\") with a total production numbering just over 15,000. Built to protect and transport the Panzergrenadier mechanized infantry forces, it was by far the most common German armoured troop-carrying vehicle of World War II, and a direct precursor to the armoured personnel carriers of today. In comparison to the most common Allied half- track of the war, the M3 Half-track, the Sd.Kfz. 251 was slower and lower- powered, but with thicker, sloping side armour provided better protection; the flat-sided M3 was, at one point, panned as the \\"Purple Heart Box\\" for being unable to stop 7.92mm Mauser bullets at close range, while the Hanomag's sloping side armour deflected Allied bullets with no similar issue. Post-war production resumed, making trailer units, followed by tractors and, in 1949, a 1.5 ton truck. Although prototypes were made, no cars were produced postwar. Rudolph Hiller, who had been president of Ph√§nomen trucks, joined the board and restructured the company by arranging for it to join the Rheinstahl consortium in 1952. Merger and split Hanomag-Henschel F 65 In 1964, Rheinstahl took over Henschel-Werke and in a reverse of history the company was merged with Hanomag. Hanomag Perfekt 400e The farm tractor operation was sold to Massey Ferguson and in 1969 the truck making division of Hanomag- Henschel went to Daimler Benz, leaving the Hanover works making earth-moving machinery for Massey Ferguson. In 1989, the world's second largest construction machine manufacturer, Komatsu, bought a share of Hanomag AG and, since 2002, Komatsu Hanomag GmbH has been a 100% subsidiary of the global company. Construction machinery loader In Hanover, the company is producing wheel loaders ranging from 54 to and since 2005 also has been producing wheeled excavators from 14 to 22 tons. Thanks to the European Technical Center (EUTC), these correspond to the latest state of technology. In Hanover, the company develops construction machines which meet varied requirements of customers all over Europe as well as for certain products also worldwide.  Hanomag in Argentina  In 1960, Cura Hnos began to build a billet factory from an electric furnace on the premises, which he later suspended for associating with Rheinstahl Hanomag, from Germany, to manufacture tractors. The new company by the merger, used the industrial warehouse of Granadero Baigorria, while the administration and factory of the new company was built.

She was a grandniece of James Fenimore Cooper, and is best known for fictions about the Great Lakes region, the American South, and American expatriates in Europe.  Life and writings =In America: the story-writer Woolson was born in Claremont, New Hampshire, but her family soon moved to Cleveland, Ohio, after the deaths of three of her sisters from scarlet fever. Woolson was educated at the Cleveland Female Seminary and a boarding school in New York. She traveled extensively through the midwest and northeastern regions of the U.S. during her childhood and young adulthood. Woolson's father died in 1869. The following year she began to publish fiction and essays in magazines such as The Atlantic Monthly and Harper's Magazine. Her first full-length publication was a children's book, The Old Stone House (1873). In 1875 she published her first volume of short stories, Castle Nowhere: Lake-Country Sketches, based on her experiences in the Great Lakes region, especially Mackinac Island. From 1873 to 1879 Woolson spent winters with her mother in St. Augustine, Florida. During these visits she traveled widely in the South which gave her material for her next collection of short stories, Rodman the Keeper: Southern Sketches (1880). After her mother's death in 1879, Woolson went to Europe, staying at a succession of hotels in England, France, Italy, Switzerland and Germany. In Europe: the novelist Anne's Tablet Woolson published her first novel Anne in 1880, followed by three others: East Angels (1886), Jupiter Lights (1889) and Horace Chase (1894). In 1883 she published the novella For the Major, a story of the postwar South that has become one of her most respected fictions. In the winter of 1889-1890 she traveled to Egypt and Greece, which resulted in a collection of travel sketches, Mentone, Cairo and Corfu (published posthumously in 1896). In 1893 Woolson rented an elegant apartment on the Grand Canal of Venice. Suffering from influenza and depression, she either jumped or fell to her death from a fourth story window in the apartment in January 1894, surviving for about an hour after the fall. Two volumes of her short stories appeared after her death: The Front Yard and Other Italian Stories (1895) and Dorothy and Other Italian Stories (1896). She is buried in the Protestant Cemetery in Rome, and is memorialized by Anne's Tablet on Mackinac Island, Michigan.

Critical reception Woolson's short stories have long been regarded as pioneering examples of local color or regionalism.Kern, John Dwight. Constance Fenimore Woolson: Literary Pioneer. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1934. Today, Woolson's novels, short stories, poetry, and travelogues are studied and taught from a range of scholarly and critical perspectives, including feminist, psychoanalytic, gender studies,See, for example: Sharon L. Dean, Constance Fenimore Woolson: Homeward Bound. Knoxville: U of Tennessee P, 1995; Cheryl B. Torsney, Constance Fenimore Woolson: The Grief of Artistry. Athens: U of Georgia P, 1989; Joan Weimer, ed. and intro. Women Artists, Women Exiles: 'Miss Grief' and Other Stories. New Brunswick: Rutgers UP, 1988; and Kristin Comment, \\"Lesbian 'Impossibilities' of Miss Grief's 'Armour.'\\" Constance Fenimore Woolson's Nineteenth Century: Essays. Ed. Victoria Brehm. Detroit, MI: Wayne State UP, 2001. 207-23. postcolonial, and new historicism.See for instance: Kathleen Diffley, ed. Witness to Reconstruction: Constance Fenimore Woolson and the Postbellum South, 1873-1894. Jackson: UP of Mississippi, 2011; Anne E. Boyd, \\"Tourism, Imperialism, and Hybridity in the Reconstruction South: Woolson's Rodman the Keeper: Southern Sketches.\\" Southern Literary Journal 43.2 (Spring 2011): 12-31; and Neill Matheson, \\"Constance Fenimore Woolson's Anthropology of Desire.\\" Legacy 26.1 (2009): 48-68. In recent decades, critical work on Woolson has blossomed and teaching of Woolson at the high school and university levels has increased. Sharon L. Dean's The Complete Letters of Constance Fenimore Woolson,Sharon L. Dean, ed. The Complete Letters of Constance Fenimore Woolson. Gainesville: UP of Florida, 2012. published in 2012, is a wonderful resource for scholars, while Anne Boyd Rioux's Constance Fenimore Woolson: Portrait of a Lady Novelist,Rioux, Anne Boyd. Constance Fenimore Woolson: The Portrait of a Lady. New York: Norton, 2016. published in 2016, provides the first full-length biography of Woolson. The Constance Fenimore Woolson Society holds regular conferences and hosts panels at the annual meeting of the American Literature Association and the biennial Society for the Study of American Women Writers conference. Friendship with Henry James The relationship between the two writers has prompted much speculation by biographers, especially Lyndall Gordon in her 1998 book, A Private Life of Henry James. Woolson's most famous story, Miss Grief, has been read as a fictionalization of their friendship, though she had not yet met James when she wrote it. Recent novels such as Emma Tennant's Felony (2002), David Lodge's Author, Author (2004), Colm Toibin's The Master (2004), and Elizabeth Maguire's The Open Door (2008) have treated the still unclear relationship between Woolson and James.

It is long and runs from the town centre to the coast of Morecambe Bay. It is entirely straight and on a single level. It is an isolated canal and does not connect to the main canal network. The canal is described as the straightest in UK, however, it is not the deepest () or the widest (). The shortest waterway is the Wardle Canal in Middlewich, Cheshire and the Manchester Ship Canal is deep and wide. History=Construction Although it is about from the shore of Morecambe Bay, the town of Ulverston was declared to be a port in 1774, which allowed certain goods to be shipped to other canals without the payment of sea duty. Ships of up to 150 tonnes could reach the shore at high water, and 70 vessels were registered there. Trade in slate and ore was growing, and canal mania was gripping the country. A local solicitor, William Burnthwaite. organised a meeting in July 1791 to consider ideas for a canal to improve access to the town. He estimated the cost at ¬£2,000. This sum had been raised by May 1792, but by then the engineer John Rennie had produced proper plans for a ship canal, estimated to cost ¬£3,084, including the construction of a sea lock. By October 1792, around ¬£3,800 had been raised, and the proposers decided to proceed. An Act of Parliament for the canal received Royal Assent on 8 May 1793. The Act was entitled \\"An Act for making and maintaining a Cut or Canal from a Place called Hammerside Hill, in the parish of Ulverstone, in the county palatine of Lancaster, to a Place called Weint End, near the town of Ulverstone aforesaid.\\" The Act empowered \\"The Company of Proprietors of the Ulverstone Canal Navigation\\" to raise amongst themselves, for the purposes of the Act, the sum of ¬£4,000 in shares of ¬£50 each, with an additional ¬£3,000 if required. The contract for the construction of the main canal was given to Pinkerton and Murray, while construction of the entrance lock was awarded to John Lancaster and James Duckworth. Work began on 23 August 1793, when the chairman cut the first sod, and was expected to be completed by September 1794. However, Pinkerton and Murray were also working on the northern end of the Lancaster Canal, and they abandoned the contract in August 1795, when they could no longer pay the wages. H. Baird took on the work, which was finished in October 1796. The canal was opened in 1796 and provided the town of Ulverston with a port. The channel was deep and wide, but ship sizes were restricted by the lock, which could accommodate vessels of , drawing between and , depending on the state of the tide. To maintain the water level, a supply was taken from Newland Beck. Delays in construction meant that the final cost was over ¬£9,200, and the opening coincided with a slump in the ore trade. It was not until June 1797 that William Burnthwaite was appointed as clerk, and a project to build a warehouse and toll office began, funded by a further call on the shareholders. Wharves for the transfer of slate and coal were constructed at the same time. Operation Before the Furness Railway was built, Furness was cut off by the mountainous Lake District on its only landward side; the region was accessed only by crossing the sands of Morecambe Bay, which was often dangerous. A passenger ferry to Liverpool from Ulverston Canal started in 1835, and it was later complemented by a service from Barrow-in-Furness to Fleetwood. A junction was formed with the Lancaster Canal. Coal, culm, and cinders from the Lancaster Canal to the Ulverston Canal were not liable to sea duty. The canal serviced the movement of goods to places as far as Glasgow and Cardiff. A footbridge at the canal foot Other industries developed as the canal was used more. Timber-related industries such as charcoal burning and hoop-making were common; shipbuilding, gas and chemical works, rail engineering works, and paper manufacturing activities also provided employment. In the 1800s there was a substantial shipbuilding industry at Ulverston, building wooden sailing ships which were strongly constructed to carry local ore rock cargoes. An example of an Ulverston ship is the barquentine Gaerwen of 249 tons, built in 1878 and later trading from Salcombe. Decline The opening of the Furness Railway in 1846 seriously damaged the profitability of the canal, which was eventually bought by the railway company. The rise of Barrow-in-Furness as a deep-water port also saw a decline in trade. After 1878, no ships were built in Ulverston. The canal was used commercially until the First World War and was officially abandoned at the end of the Second World War. It has since been maintained by Ulverston town council, who maintain a walkway on its eastern side. Its western side is still industrialised, with a large GlaxoSmithKline factory (built on the site of the former iron works and paper mills). Glaxo bought the canal from the town council in 1974 and used it as an emergency water reserve. In 2009, GlaxoSmithKline reviewed their operations at Ulverston and later sold the canal to Ulverston Canal Company, a company set up to manage the asset. This is a subsidiary of NPL Estates Ltd, which specialises in land management. A Trust has also been set up by GlaxoSmithKline, to ensure that funds are available for the canal's management, maintenance, and preservation. Route In addition to the industry on its western side, there is a sheep and cattle auction by the canal, and other buildings, some of which have been renovated and some of which are dilapidated. At the end of the canal is a pub, The Bay Horse, which is on the site of an 18th-century coaching inn, and part of the Cumbria Coastal Way. The canal began at Hammerside Hill at Morecambe Bay and terminated at a basin and wharves at Ulverston. At its head there is a sea lock, the only lock on the canal. A public swing bridge was built over the canal at Hammerside.

Life and career Simon was born in Cascia, Italy, around 1295, of the distinguished Fidati family. His initial studies were in the natural sciences, which he later gave up for theology and scripture. He entered the Order of Augustinian Hermits at about the age of twenty. He began his preaching ministry in 1318, and was renowned as a brilliant preacher in places such as Perugia, Bologna, Siena, and Florence. His model of austerity and strict penances brought him more followers. He was a gifted spiritual advisor and confessor and, spent many nights writing letters to those seeking his guidance.\\"Blessed Simon of Cascia, priest\\", Order of St. Augustine His desire for a spiritual life of study, prayer and solitude caused him to reject all episcopal appointments.

The game was released in 1995. The player controls, via a first person perspective, a Wild West cowboy as he ventures into a haunted town in order to save a child that was taken from his parents. The U.S.-based Entertainment Software Rating Board gave the game a \\"M\\" rating for its graphic violence, blood and gore, and bits of profanity. The game was released for the personal computer in Europe, and the original PlayStation edition was given an international release. Plot The game begins just after a wagon caravan has been attacked by werewolves, who ended up stealing a man's only son. The player character, an anti-hero cowboy, agrees to go to the town, find the child and return him to his father. As the cowboy ventures into the town picking up various objects, interacting with the locals, and finding a safe place before the werewolves begin to prowl, he realizes that this once God- fearing and prosperous silvermining town has become a cursed den of vice, ghouls, vampires and werewolves after the original town's residents slaughtered an American Indian tribe. The tribesmen, as it just so happens, were the cowboy's long-lost ancestors. Gameplay As is the case with other graphic adventure games, progress in Silverload involves finding and interacting with various \\"hot spots\\" in order to pick up objects, solve puzzles and interact with (or kill) the various characters in the town. Picking up certain objects will cause the game's (and town's) clock to move forward, and thus, the trick to success is to pick up the right items in the precise order. Otherwise, the player must restart the game from the beginning, or from the last save point.  Reception  The initial European PC release was universally panned by critics. Just Adventure gave it an F grade, and listed it as one of the five worst adventure games of all-time in their Dungeon of Shame feature. The review stated that the \\"few minor details\\" of \\"jerky animation, incoherent puzzles, bad interface and horrendous lip- synching ... separate Silverload from the gaming classics,\\" and attested the one redeeming factor was its plot. The PlayStation release, however, was not a direct port, but an entire reworking of the title that actually received a few positive reviews. Scary Larry gave it a heavily mixed review in GamePro. He lambasted the graphics and sounds, citing poor illustrations for the static graphics and offensive ethnic stereotypes in the voice acting, but said the gameplay is more interesting than most point-and-click adventures. He recommended that players rent the game rather than buy it. Unlike Scary Larry, a reviewer for Next Generation was actually pleased with the illustrations, saying they \\"give even the relatively 'normal' scenes in the game a strange, ethereal glow.\\" He also praised the dialogue, challenge, and generally chilling atmosphere, though he criticized that the hot-spot based interface makes the control difficult even when using the PlayStation Mouse. He summarized Silverload as \\"a game that, while following a genre's conventions, simply does everything smashingly well.\\" IGN was also positive, claiming \\"Great graphics and a compelling horror story set in the Old West make for a truly remarkable game.\\" Like Next Generation, they found the game's one major flaw to be the hot-spot based interface, concurring that using the PlayStation Mouse does not help the problem. In a 2012 retrospective feature, John Szczepaniak of Hardcore Gaming 101 claimed the \\"PSOne update, has a number of clever ideas to separate itself from the adventure game pack\\" and praised its \\"good ideas, fantastic setting, great script and suitable voice acting\\", also stating \\"the 3D shooting sections are very slick and extremely awesome.\\" The game is also occasionally listed for being one of the weirdest western works ever created, and the PlayStation version is also considered a collectable for being one of only a handful of titles released in the bumpy-cased longbox packaging.

She is sometimes referred to as \\"Hurricane Jessie\\" in the Italian press.Hurricane Jessie (It) She was a nurse to General Giuseppe Garibaldi's soldiers in four wars; she researched living conditions in subterranean Naples and working conditions in Sicily's sulphur mines. She wrote copiously (in English and Italian) as both a journalist and a biographer. Her most famous biography was about Giuseppe Garibaldi.Jessie Mario White. Garibaldi e i suoi tempi Treves Editoriale. Milano, 1884  Biography =Youth and education Born Jessie Jane Meriton White, she was the daughter of Thomas White and Jane Teage Meriton of Gosport, Hampshire, England.E Holt, Risorgimento (London 1970) p. 197 Thomas was part of the White family of Cowes, Isle of Wight, boat builders for generations, but he moved to the mainland and switched from building boats to building docks and warehouses. His was a religiously strict, non- conformist, household. It was also an educationally non-conformist household. Unlike almost all middle-class girls growing up in Victorian England, Jessie received an excellent education culminating in studying philosophy with Hugues Felicit√© Robert de Lamennais at the Sorbonne in Paris between 1852 and 1854. Also in Paris during those years was Mrs. Emma Roberts who considered herself engaged to Giuseppe Garibaldi. Jessie and Mrs. Roberts became friends and when Mrs. Roberts went to visit Garibaldi first in Nice and then Sardinia, she took Jessie as her companion. Italian unification Jessie, like many in Britain, had heard for some time about the atrocities of the Austrian, French and Bourbon dictatorships in various parts of the Italian peninsula. Garibaldi fired her imagination and she dedicated herself to the Unification of Italy. Upon her return to London in the spring of 1855, Jessie applied to medical schools with the hope of becoming a doctor ‚Äì some (Edwin Pratt in Pioneer Women in Victoria‚Äôs Reign, for one) have said she was the first woman in England to do so. All her applications were rejected because of her gender.Daniels 1972 Jessie White's house in Lendinara (Rovigo). She became a propagandist for the Italian cause working with Giuseppe Mazzini, then in exile in London, who noted approvingly that \\"she is very absolute in her opinions\\".Quoted in E Holt, Risorgimento (London 1970) p. 197 She wrote newspaper articles explaining the issues in Italy, gave lectures and raised funds for the Italian cause in northern England and Scotland. When, in 1857, Mazzini went to Genoa, Jessie followed him. Her arrival was announced in the Italia del Popolo newspaper, which had been publishing accounts of her speaking tours. She was treated as a celebrity, toured the area and successfully deflected attention away from Mazzini, who was working on a clandestine expedition to break patriots out of a Bourbon prison near Naples. The operation failed badly, Mazzini escaped the police round-up and returned to London. Jessie was captured and sent to prisonGreen Bay Press-Gazette, 30 Mar 1906, Fri, Page 10 https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25099795/jessie_white_mario_sent_to_prison/ in Genoa for four months, where she met the man who would become her husband, Alberto Mario.M Sutcliffe, Victorian Radicals and Italian Democrats (2014) p. 92-3 They married in December 1857 at her family's home in England. Jessie continued her speaking tours in England and Scotland, to much acclaim.M Sutcliffe, Victorian Radicals and Italian Democrats (2014) p. 92-3 In the Fall of 1858 Jessie and Alberto went to New York City to continue lecturing and fund-raising; she to English speaking audiences and he to Italian speakers. Spring 1860 found them in Lugano, Switzerland, from where they rushed to Genoa to be part of the second wave of volunteers going to Sicily to join Garibaldi in his lightning-fast conquest of the Bourbon-controlled southern half of Italy. Alberto was on Garibaldi's staff and Jessie was nurse to the wounded, doing whatever was needed.E Holt, Risorgimento (London 1970) p. 242 This included tightly holding a boy while his arm was amputated without anaesthesia. Skills learned and refined during this war were used again in 1866 in the war against the Austrians west of Venice; in 1867 at Monterotondo and Mentana, north of Rome; and in the 1870-71 Franco-Prussian War when Garibaldi led an army against the Germans in eastern France. As the unification of the Italian peninsula became complete, in 1870, with the addition of Rome which quickly became the capital, attention shifted to the problems of this new country. Social issues were not high on the agenda; in fact, most social problems were not even recognised by the new government. Social concerns Starting in the early 1870s Jessie devoted herself to philanthropic work among the urban poor of South Italy,J Davis, 'Garibaldi and England' History Today 32 (Dec 1982) p. 24 working particularly on three research projects aimed at raising governmental awareness and encouraging subsequent action. The first was to research the causes, effects and possible solution to the problem of pellagra. This disease, of the three D's ‚Äî dermatitis, diarrhoea and dementia ‚Äî is caused by lack of protein-rich foods in the diet and a subsequent lack of vitamin B3. Jessie's research into pellagra lasted for ten years, and her findings showed that even such simple, readily available diet supplements as two glasses of red wine per week reduced the effects of the illness. Plaque in Florence The second was research into the living conditions of the poor in Naples, which was viewed by the government as a very prosperous city. Jessie found large numbers of people living in grottos, under Naples' streets ‚Äì huge communal spaces with no sanitation, where only crude curtains separated one family's area from the others, all unseen and ignored by Neapolitan citizens in the streets above, except for the grotto landlords who collected exorbitant rents. Her report, La miseria in Napoli (\\"The Poor of Naples\\"), was published in 1877, and is cited in timelines of important events in southern Italy. (see The New History of the Italian South, edited by Robert Lumley and Jonathan Morris, 1997) The third was research into working conditions in the Sicilian sulphur mines. There was a concern about child labour and the general health of the miners: many of whom were physically unfit for military service. Jessie made extensive personal tours and investigations of the mines, both above and below ground, and published her report, Le miniere di Zolfo in Sicilia (The Sulphur Mines in Sicily) in 1894. Writings Jessie made her living writing. Jessie's career as a journalist had started in England writing for British newspapers (Litta Visconti Arese in his introduction to The Birth of Modern Italy, says Jessie was the first woman journalist in England.) She also wrote for newspapers in the United States and Italian press. Starting in 1866 the first of what would be 143 articles over 40 years appeared in The Nation published weekly in New York. She was also a frequent contributor to Nuova Antologia a semi-monthly magazine published in Florence. (Rossella Certini [see below] has written that Jessie was the first journalist in Italy to explore the 'cracks' in the Italian reality.) Writing was also a way of expressing her passion for Italy and its people. She wanted to make sure that some of the lesser known heroes of the Risorgimento were not forgotten. She wrote biographies of Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini, to be sure; but also biographies of Dr. Agostino Bertani, Carlo Cattaneo (with Alberto Mario), Giuseppe Dolfo, Alberto Mario (with Giosu√® Carducci), Giovanni Nicotera. She was gathering material for several more at the time of her death. Jessie also wrote a couple of histories: I Garibaldini in Francia about the Franco-Prussian War; and The Birth of Modern Italy, which was published posthumously. She died on 5 March 1906 in Florence. A non-religious ceremony was held at her apartment followed by a procession through the streets of Florence. Her ashes are buried in the cemetery at Lendinara, south of Venice, next to Alberto's. Giosu√® Carducci, the 1906 Nobel Laureate for Literature, said: Jessie White Mario 'is a great woman to whom we Italians owe a lot.'

Colin Campbell and his son, Thomas M. Campbell II. It was first published in the United States in January 2005 and had sold over one million copies as of October 2013, making it one of America's best-selling books about nutrition. For over one million copies sold, \\"The China Study\\", the chinastudy.com, archived October 18, 2013. The China Study examines the link between the consumption of animal products (including dairy) and chronic illnesses such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and bowel cancer. The authors conclude that people who eat a predominantly whole-food, vegan diet‚Äîavoiding animal products as a main source of nutrition, including beef, pork, poultry, fish, eggs, cheese, and milk, and reducing their intake of processed foods and refined carbohydrates‚Äîwill escape, reduce, or reverse the development of numerous diseases. They write that \\"eating foods that contain any cholesterol above 0 mg is unhealthy.\\" The book recommends sunshine exposure or dietary supplements to maintain adequate levels of vitamin D, and supplements of vitamin B12 in case of complete avoidance of animal products. It criticizes low-carb diets, such as the Atkins diet, which include restrictions on the percentage of calories derived from carbohydrates The authors are critical of reductionist approaches to the study of nutrition, whereby certain nutrients are blamed for disease, as opposed to studying patterns of nutrition and the interactions between nutrients. The book is \\"loosely based\\" on the China‚ÄìCornell‚ÄìOxford Project, a 20-year study‚Äîdescribed by The New York Times as \\"the Grand Prix of epidemiology\\"‚Äîconducted by the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, Cornell University, and the University of Oxford. T. Colin Campbell was one of the study's directors. It looked at mortality rates from cancer and other chronic diseases from 1973 to 1975 in 65 counties in China; the data was correlated with 1983‚Äì84 dietary surveys and blood work from 100 people in each county. The research was conducted in those counties because they had genetically similar populations that tended, over generations, to live and eat in the same way in the same place. The study concluded that counties with a high consumption of animal-based foods in 1983‚Äì84 were more likely to have had higher death rates from \\"Western\\" diseases as of 1973‚Äì75, while the opposite was true for counties that ate more plant-based foods.  Contents  The China Study is divided into four parts. In the first, The China Study, the authors describe some of the health problems faced by Americans, early lab work by T. Colin Campbell, and the epidemiological study known as the China Study. In Part II, Diseases of Affluence, the authors discuss each of the diseases separately along with scientific studies of their links to diet. In Part III, The Good Nutrition Guide, they give their recommendations for a healthy diet. Finally, in Part IV, Why Haven't You Heard This Before?, they argue that there are there are systemic problems in science, academia and government that tend to suppress information on the role of diet in preventing disease.  Part I: The China Study  Chapter 1: Problems We Face, Solutions We Need = In Chapter 1, the authors describe worsening epidemics of cancer, obesity and diabetes in the United States. They note that the medical system is the third highest cause of death. It is also the most expensive in the world and rapidly becoming more expensive. While good nutrition can solve many of these problems, the American public is getting a lot of contradictory advice on nutrition and is harmed by a series of diet fads. The authors introduce their recommendation, which is to avoid animal- based foods and eat whole, plant-based foods. = Chapter 2: A House of Proteins = Chapter 2 examines the history of protein research and the emphasis on protein in dietary recommendations. In particular, animal protein is described as \\"high quality\\" because it comes close to matching the balance of amino acids in human protein, while vegetarians believe that they must carefully match ingredients to get all the amino acids they need. However, the authors state that the human body can synthesize all the amino acids it needs from a varied plant diet. Colin Campbell describes how he began with a traditional view of the importance of protein, but some research changed his mind. A study of nutrition in the Philippines found that fungus in peanuts and corn was producing aflatoxin, a potent carcinogen; and the highest rates of liver cancer were in affluent families where the children had abundant protein. He also found a research paper from India that showed a strong association between protein consumption and liver cancer in rats. The rest of the chapter describes topics in research methodology, including the difference between correlation and causation, statistical significance, mechanisms of action and meta-analysis. = Chapter 3: Turning off cancer = Chapter 3 begins with a description of the deep public interest in carcinogens. An example is nitrites, chemicals found in foods such as hot dogs, bacon and canned meat. In the rats, these were \\"anticipated to be human carcinogens\\" based on laboratory studies with rats. The authors emphasize that these studies exposed the rats to enormous quantities of nitrites, and the effect on cancer rates was modest (in one study, rising from 5% to 10%). Colin Campbell then describes coming across an Indian research paper in which lowering the intake of protein reduced cancer from 100% to 0%. The rest of the chapter discusses research that Campbell and colleagues did on the relationship between diet and cancer. He describes three stages of cancer. In the initiation phase, a carcinogen enters a cell and is metabolized by an enzyme called mixed-function oxidase (MFO). Although the products of this metabolism are mostly safe, there are some toxic byproducts that can damage DNA. In the promotion phase, tumors grow from tiny clusters of cells called foci. This phase is reversible, depending on the balance between promoters that feed growth and anti-promoters that inhibit it. Finally, progression is the spreading of the cancer from its source to neighboring parts of the body, at which point it is considered malignant. Rats were fed aflatoxin and varying amounts of protein (between 5% and 20% of their diet). A low-protein diet greatly reduced tumor initiation by several mechanisms; for example, enzyme activity dropped and fewer toxins binded to DNA. In the promotion phase, the development of foci was \\"almost entirely dependent on how much protein was consumed, regardless of how much aflatoxin was consumed.\\" They developed if the protein content exceeded the amount (12%) that their bodies required to grow, and focal growth could be switched on or off by varying the protein. Finally, a population of several hundred rats were studied over 100 weeks, close to the normal lifetime of a rat. At the end of this period, all rats on the 5% diet were \\"alive and active, with sleek hair coats\\" while all those on the 20% diet were dead. Much the same results were obtained in studies of liver cancer and diet in mice. In the above experiments, the rats were fed casein, the dominant protein in cow's milk. However, plant proteins such as gluten (from wheat) and soy protein did not promote the growth of tumors, even at the higher levels. The conclusion is that animal-based foods increase tumor development while plant-based foods decrease it. However, the chapter ends by noting that experiments involving rats do not provide quantitative information on the effect of diet on humans. This serves as an introduction to the next chapter. = Chapter 4: Lessons From China = Chapter 4 discusses the China‚ÄìCornell‚ÄìOxford Project, a massive epidemiological study conducted in the 1980s, also referred to as the China Study. The book takes its title from this study. It built on a national survey in the 1970s that collected data on mortality for 96% of Chinese citizens and produced an atlas of rates for each kind of disease (of which there were more than four dozen) cancer by region. Rates for some cancers varied by a factor of over 100, a far greater variation than in the United States. With colleagues Junshi Chen and Junyao Li from China and Richard Peto of Oxford University, Colin Campbell led a study that encompassed 65 counties in China with 100 adults per county. This involved questionnaires, blood tests, urine samples and food samples from local marketplaces. They found that diseases tended to be in one of two groups: diseases of affluence (cancer, diabetes, and heart disease) and diseases of poverty (such as pneumonia, peptic ulcer, and pulmonary tuberculosis). One of the strongest predictors of the diseases of affluence (also referred to as Western diseases) was blood cholesterol. The average level in China was 127 mg/dL (far less than the American average of 215 mg/dL) and the county averages were as low as 94 mg/dL. The death rate from heart disease was 17 times lower than in America, yet still was strongly dependent on cholesterol level. The blood cholesterol was in turn strongly correlated with animal protein intake, even though Chinese consumed about ten time less on average than Americans. In particular, liver cancer was strongly associated with cholesterol level, as well as chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (\\"the virus provides the gun, and bad nutrition pulls the trigger.\\") The association with cholesterol was consistent with the lab studies described in the previous chapter. The chapter examines the role of various components of animal and plant food. Previous international studies had shown a correlation between dietary fat and breast cancer, although only with fat from animals. The China Study found a consistent web of correlations between consumption of animal-based foods and breast cancer as well as a host of risk factors for breast cancer, including age of menarche, estrogen levels and cholesterol. Dietary fiber, which is found only in plants, has benefits including an ability to gather up harmful chemicals from the intestines, but there were claims that it inhibited the uptake of iron. The China Study provided evidence for an increase in iron absorption with an increase in fiber because high- fiber foods are also high in iron. Where iron levels were low, in some rural areas, the problem was associated with parasitic diseases. Another class of chemicals found almost exclusively in plants is the antioxidants such as carotenoids, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and vitamin E. These provide much of the color in plant food and are designed to combat free radicals, a harmful byproduct of photosynthesis but also present in the human body for a variety of reasons. In the China Study, strong links were seen between increased levels of vitamin C in the blood (mainly due to fruit consumption) and lower risk of several kinds of cancer (by factors of up to 8). Blood levels of other kinds of antioxidant were more difficult to measure, so few correlations were seen. Many fad diets are low-carbohydrate diets that restrict the consumption of carbohydrates. This includes the refined carbohydrates in products like sugar and white flour, but also the complex carbohydrates in fruits, vegetables and whole grains. In their place are increased fat and protein. The authors argue that people who follow these diets lose weight because their calorie intake is restricted. They add that this is unsustainable and cite research that shows adverse health effects. They also argue that one of the main justifications for increasing dietary fat is false: a claim that Americans have had a mania for reducing fat, yet they are fatter than ever. However, Americans have actually increased their consumption of fats, and even more rapidly increased their consumption of refined carbohydrates in junk food. In the China Study, the least active Chinese consumed 30% more calories than their American counterparts yet their body weight was 20% lower. The excess calories were lost as heat rather than being stored as fat. The China Study also found that protein intake is associated with height and body weight, whether the source of protein is animals or plants. They also find strong correlations between low body size and diseases of poverty, which explains why people in developing nations are smaller than people in wealthy nations.  Part II: Diseases of Affluence  Part II looks at the diseases (like heart disease, cancer, stroke, Alzheimer's, obesity and diabetes) that were classified as diseases of affluence in Chapter 4. Each chapter summarizes research on one or more closely related diseases and the role of diet. = Chapter 5: Broken Hearts = Chapter 5 looks at heart disease and diet. It begins by noting that heart disease is the leading source of mortality in Americans, killing about 40% of them. It is pervasive even in young, active Americans in the form of plaque buildup that partially blocks arteries. If this occurs slowly, the body can compensate by finding new pathways. However, if a plaque deposit ruptures, this can lead to rapid clotting and sometimes full blockage of an artery downstream, and the body does not have time to compensate. The result is a heart attack. Starting in 1948, the Framingham Heart Study followed over 5,000 volunteers and developed the concept of a risk factor. For heart disease, risk factors included cholesterol, blood pressure, physical activity, cigarette smoking and obesity. Multiple studies showed that fat and cholesterol are harmful, although they could be \\"merely indicators of animal food intake\\". Others, dating back as far as the beginning of the 20th century, implicated animal protein, but such claims have been very controversial, with detractors mocking plant eaters as effeminate. The main aim of research has been to develop technology such as coronary bypass surgery, coronary angioplasty, defibrillators, pacemakers and heart transplants. Such methods have lowered the death rate but not the incidence rate of heart disease. They save lives when a heart attack is in progress, but are costly and have dangerous side effects such as stroke. \\"When used for stable disease, bypass surgery, angioplasty, and stents do not address the cause of heart disease, prevent heart attacks, or extend the lives of any but the sickest heart disease patients.\\" The remainder of the chapter describes research by two doctors: Caldwell Esselstyn and Dean Ornish. While at the Cleveland Clinic, a center for cardiac care, Esselstyn tested the effect of a WFPB diet on 23 of his patients who had severe heart disease. Over 11 years, one of the 17 who stuck with the diet had any further coronary events and one who strayed from the diet for 2 years had a single event. Several had reduced blockages in their arteries. Meanwhile, five who dropped off the diet had ten new events. In a subsequent study of 198 patients, 177 who adhered to a WFPB diet and stopped taking medicine had a total of only one cardiac event, while 62% of the other 21 patients had events. Dean Ornish conducted a controlled study in which 28 heart disease patients were treated with lifestyle changes only and twenty with a standard approach. The former group had dramatic reductions in cholesterol and a 91% reduction in chest pains, and blockages in their arteries shrank. Members of the control group had a 165% increase in chest pains, their cholesterol levels were worse and their blockages increased. = Chapter 6: Obesity = Chapter 6 discusses the problem of obesity in America. For both adults and children, this is associated with reductions in quality of life as well as myriad health problems, including diabetes, sleep apnea and bone problems. Costs of medical treatment rose from $70 billion in 1999 to more than $147 billion in 2006, while weight management treatments cost another $60 billion, yet obesity is on the rise. Multiple intervention studies are cited that show rapid weight loss when a WFPB diet is followed. This is sustainable because there is no need for calorie restriction; vegetarians tend to have a higher metabolic rate, burning more calories. = Chapter 7: Diabetes = Chapter 7 begins with a description of Types 1 and 2 diabetes, which as of 2012 afflicted 9.3% of adults in the U.S. and is associated with much greater risk of heart, kidney and nervous system diseases as well as blindness and other complications. The economic impact was over $245 billion in 2013. Multiple epidemiological studies showed that high- fiber, plant-based diets protect against diabetes. Experimental studies, particularly those by James Anderson and Nathan Pritikin, also showed that almost all patients on such a diet could stop using insulin medication after a few weeks and stay off it, while less strict diets also showed benefits. = Chapter 8: Common Cancers = Chapter 8, with the full title Common cancers: Breast, prostate, large bowel (colon and rectal) begins by noting that these three cancers represent a broader range of cancers for which similar analyses apply. Breast cancer is associated with risk factors including early age of menarche, late age of menopause, high levels of female hormones (including estrogen and progesterone), and high blood cholesterol. All these factors are worsened by a diet high in animal proteins and refined carbohydrates. However, the medical establishment has focussed most of its attention on genetic mutations BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are rare; screening, which can lead to earlier treatment but may not improve survival rate; and anti-estrogen drugs such as tamoxifen that do not address the causes of high estrogen. Environmental chemicals that can promote cancer include dioxins and PCB's, which are primarily found in animal-based foods; and Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are pollution products. Laboratory studies have shown that the rate at which they cause cancer is controlled by diet; but epidemiological studies have not adequately accounted for the role of diet. Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer worldwide and second most common in the U.S. There are large differences in rates between countries, and studies of migrants favor environment over genetics as the reason. A 1975 study of 32 countries found a particularly strong link between colon cancer and meat intake. A study by Denis Burkitt in Africa found that low-fiber diets increased the risk of colon cancer. However, most studies cannot separate the effects of the hundreds of kinds of fiber from each other, from other benefits of eating fiber-rich foods, or from reduced consumption of animal products. A 1985 study in South Africa does show that animal products contribute to the risk. Prostate cancer is a slow-growing cancer that is one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer. Reviews of the literature show a strong association with consumption of animal-based foods, with higher consumption of dairy doubling or quadrupling the risk. Animal protein increases the production of insulin-like growth factor 1, disturbing the balance between growth and removal of cells, and suppresses the activated form of Vitamin D, suppressing its multiple health benefits. Research by Dr. Ornish, after the first edition of the book, showing that a WFPB diet could \\"halt and even reverse\\" prostate cancer. = Chapter 9: Autoimmune diseases = Autoimmune diseases, which include multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and Type 1 diabetes, afflict 7‚Äì10% of the world's population. The highest incidences often occur in the same populations. They occur when the body's immune system, which normally protects the body from foreign cells, attacks the body's own cells. This can occur when the foreign protein cells, or antigens, are difficult to distinguish from the body's proteins. Many such molecular mimics are found in food, particularly cow's milk. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakes cells of the pancreas for improperly digested protein fragments such as bovine serum albumin. This can happen if an infant is switched from breastfeeding to cow's milk prematurely. Multiple studies show a strong association between consumption of cow's milk and type 1 diabetes. However, there are strong commercial interests in cow's milk production, and this (or a prejudice in favor of milk) motivates some scientists to overstate the controversy in these results.  Publication  The book was first published in 2005. A revised and expanded edition was published in 2016. The book has also been published in German, Polish, Slovenian, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Romanian, Swedish and Urdu.  Companion volumes   Reception Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said in his documentary The Last Heart Attack in 2011 that The China Study had changed the way people all over the world eat. Former American President Bill Clinton became a supporter when he adopted a plant-based diet after a heart attack. Wilfred Niels Arnold, professor of biochemistry at the University of Kansas Medical Center, reviewed the book in Leonardo reviews in 2005: \\"[T]he authors anticipate resistant and hostile sources, sail on with escalating enthusiasm, and furnish a working hypothesis that is valuable. In fact, the surprising data are difficult to interpret in any other way.\\" In a written debate with Campbell in 2008, nutritionist Loren Cordain argued that \\"the fundamental logic underlying Campbell's hypothesis (that low [animal] protein diets improve human health) is untenable and inconsistent with the evolution of our own species.\\" Campbell argued that \\"diet‚Äìdisease associations observed in contemporary times are far more meaningful than what might have occurred during evolutionary times‚Äîat least since the last 2.5 million years or so.\\"Cordain, Loren and Campbell, T. Colin. \\"The Protein Debate\\", Performance Menu: Journal of Nutrition & Athletic Excellence, 2008, accessed August 28, 2011. The book was reviewed by Harriet Hall, a physician and skeptic who writes about alternative medicine, in a blog entry posted on the Science-Based Medicine website in 2009. Hall argued that the book had references which do not support directly the claims made by the authors. She also stated that the book does not explain the exceptions to his data‚Äîfor example that \\"stomach cancer rates are higher in China than elsewhere in the world.\\" However, subsequent studies have shown Helicobacter pylori, a prominent disease in China, to be the prominent cause of stomach cancer in most individuals.

Hailing from Lombardy, he was most likely a native of Orsenigo, near Como. Orsenigo is remembered mostly for his work on the Cathedral of Milan. On a 1387 list of masters working on the Duomo, his name comes immediately after that of Marco da Campione, who headed the associates. On it, Orsenigo is called an engineer (Insegnerius). Another master with the same name, Paolino Orsenigo, was also employed at the cathedral - in 1400 - as master of the scaffolding.

His family was very prestigious and his father very involved in politics. He was a gambler and often made unsafe investments, though he managed to make money from it several times during his life. He bought and sold horses, wine, wool, and clothing among other things. In 1422, he was elected the Standard Bearer of Justice, Florence's highest post. In 1401, while serving as the Florentine ambassador to Bavaria, he, his brothers, and their descendants were ennobled by Rupert, King of Germany, after having saved his life by thwarting a poisoning attempt by the Duke of Milan. His son, Luca, built the Palazzo Pitti in Florence, but never finished it, it was given to him, but he sold it in 1549. Buonaccorso's descendants, the Counts Buonacorsi di Pistoia,Buoncorsi Foundation moved from Tuscany to Bavaria in the late 19th century. The family emigrated to the U.S. in the early 20th century.

Use Many Windstopper garments are marketed as \\"softshells\\" suited to high-output aerobic activities such as running, cycling or cross- country skiing. Because they are not waterproof, they are more breathable than traditional Gore-Tex \\"hardshell\\" clothing.

(Harper‚Äôs, May 1867) In the history of slavery, the legal doctrine of Partus sequitur ventrem (L. ‚ÄúThat which is brought forth follows the belly‚Äù; also partus) was used from 1662 in Virginia and later other English royal colonies to establish the legal status of children born there; they were considered to follow the status of their mothers. Therefore, children of enslaved women were born into slavery; those born to free white women (even if indentured servants) were born free. The legal doctrine of partus sequitur ventrem derived from Roman civil law, which concerned personal property (chattels). In colonial law, the partus doctrine was also used to justify enslavement, as chattels personal, of the native peoples of the Americas (northern, central, southern) where the Spanish empire (1492‚Äì1976), the Portuguese empire (1543‚Äì1975), the French colonial empire (1534‚Äì1980), and the Dutch empire (1450‚Äì1999) established settler colonies to exploit the natural resources of the New World.M.H.Davidson (1997) Columbus Then and Now, a life re-examined. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, p. 417) As the colonial law in British America (1607‚Äì1783), the partus doctrine, passed into law in 1662 in the Virginia colony, established that children were born into the social status of their mother, unlike in English common law, in which the father's status was determinative. Thus de facto and de jure slave status was applied to every child born to an enslaved woman. Other colonies adopted this principle, and it was applied and enforced through the local laws that regulated slavery in the North American colonies (1526‚Äì1776). As a function of the political economy of chattel slavery, the legalism of partus sequitur ventrem exempted the biological father from his food-and-shelter obligations, under English common law, toward children he fathered with a slave woman. The denial of paternity to slave children secured the slaveholders' right to profit from exploiting the labour of children engendered, bred, and born into slavery.Lovell Banks, Taunya \\"Dangerous Woman: Elizabeth Key's Freedom Suit ‚Äî Subjecthood and Racialized Identity in Seventeenth century Colonial Virginia\\", 41 Akron Law Review 799 (2008), Digital Commons Law, University of Maryland Law School, accessed 21 April 2009. But it also meant that mixed-race children born to white women were born free. Early generations of families of free people of color in the Upper South were formed from unions between working-class white women and African or African-American men. cite weburl=www.freeafricanamericans.comlast=Heineggfirst=Paultitle=Free African Americans in Virginia, North and South Carolina, Delaware and Marylanddate=1995-2005}} History=Background In British America (1607‚Äì1783), colonists struggled to determine the status of the children of subjects and foreigners. English common law was paternalistic, and determined the legal status (bond or free) of the child of a British subject as based on the legal status of the father as head of family and household, as pater familias. To live in society, a man was legally required to acknowledge his bastard children as well as legal ones, and to support them with food, shelter, and money, and to arrange an apprenticeship so that he or she could become a self-supporting adult. Regarding chattels (personal property), English common law indicated that the profits generated by chattels (live stock, mobile property) accrued to the owner of said chattels. Beginning in Virginia in 1662, the colonial legislature incorporated that Roman legal doctrine of partus sequitur ventrem into law in British North America, ruling that the children born in the colonies took the status of their mothers; therefore, children of enslaved mothers were born into slavery as chattel, regardless of the status of their fathers. It was associated with the civil law in Britain, but there the partus legal doctrine did not make chattels of human beings. In mid-17th-century Virginia, the mixed-race woman Elizabeth Key Grinstead, then illegally classified as a slave, won her freedom lawsuit (21 July 1656) and formal, legal recognition as a free coloured woman in the thirteen colonies of British North America. Key's successful lawsuit was based upon facts of her birth: her white English father was a member of the House of Burgesses; had acknowledged his paternity of Elizabeth, who was baptized as a Christian in the Church of England; and, before his death, had arranged a guardianship for her, by way of indentured servitude until she came of age. When the man to whom Key was indentured returned to England, he sold her indenture contract to a second man. The latter prolonged Key's servitude beyond the indenture's original term. At the death of the second owner of her indenture, his estate classified Elizabeth Key and her mixed-race son (who also had a white father), as ‚ÄúNegro slaves‚Äù who were personal property of the deceased. Colonial-era legal cases about the rights (human, economic, political) of the mixed-race children of Englishmen and slave women were to determine whether or not a mixed-race person was a British subject. The English colonists were subjects of the Crown, but in England and the colonies, Africans and all non-white foreigners were ineligible to be a British subject. Moreover, British subjecthood also was denied to mixed-race children because they were generally not Christians. They were considered foreigners in a British colony and without legal rights under English common law. As dependencies of the Crown, colonial governments could not legally determine either the subjecthood or the citizenship of the mixed-race children born of a British white man and an enslaved black woman. British colonial demands for manual labourers required more slaves from Africa to replace the declining number of indentured servants whose contracts had expired. Therefore, in 1662, the Virginia House of Burgesses legislated partus sequitur ventrem to establish that ‚Äúall children borne in this country shall be held bond or free only according to the [legal] condition of the mother‚Äù, because enslaved African women and their children were not British subjects. Kolchin, Peter American Slavery, 1619-1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, p. 17. That distinction resulted in enslaved women and their children being classified as the non-white Other, a racial caste of unpaid workers. After independence from Britain, slave law in the United States continued that distinction. Virginia established a law that no one could be a slave in the state other than those who had that status on October 17, 1785 \\"and the descendants of the females of them.\\" Kentucky adopted this law in 1798; Mississippi passed a similar law in 1822, using the phrase about females and their descendants; as did Florida in 1828. Louisiana, whose legal system was based on civil law (following its French colonial past), in 1825 added this language to its code: \\"Children born of a mother then in a state of slavery, whether married or not, follow the condition of their mother.\\" Other states adopted this \\"norm\\" through judicial rulings. In summary, the legal doctrine of partus sequitur ventrem functioned economically to provide a steady supply of slaves.Lovell Banks, Taunya \\"Dangerous Woman: Elizabeth Key's Freedom Suit ‚Äî Subjecthood and Racialized Identity in Seventeenth century Colonial Virginia\\", 41 Akron Law Review 799 (2008), Digital Commons Law, University of Maryland Law School, accessed 21 April 2009. Mixed-race slaves By the 18th century, the colonial slave population included mixed-race children of white ancestry, such as mulattoes (half-black), [quadroonquadroons (quarter-black) and octoroons. They were fathered by white planters, overseers, and other men with power, with enslaved women, who were also sometimes of mixed race.Ellis, Joseph American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson (1993) p. 000. Numerous mixed-race slaves lived in stable families at the Monticello plantation of Thomas Jefferson. In 1773 his wife, Martha Wayles, inherited more than one hundred slaves from her father John Wayles. These included the six mixed-race children (three-quarters white) whom he fathered with his concubine Betty Hemings. She was a mulatto born of an Englishman and an enslaved African (black) woman. Martha Wayles's 75 percent-white half-brothers and half-sisters included the much younger Sally Hemings. Later the widower Jefferson took Sally Hemings as a concubine and, over 38 years, had six mixed-race children with her, born into slavery. They were seven-eighths white in ancestry. Four survived to adulthood.\\"Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account\\", Monticello Website, Thomas Jefferson Foundation, accessed 22 June 2011. Quote: \\"Ten years later [referring to their 2000 report], TJF and most historians now believe that, years after his wife's death, Thomas Jefferson was the father of the six children of Sally Hemings mentioned in Jefferson's records, including Beverly, Harriet, Madison and Eston Hemings.\\"Helen F.M. Lear, National Genealogical Society Quarterly, Vol. 89, No. 3, September 2001, p. 207 Partus sequitur ventrem: A slaver sells his mulatto son into slavery. (The House that Jeff Built, David Claypoole Johnston, 1863) Under Virginia law, the Jefferson‚ÄìHemings children, seven-eighths European would have been considered legally white if free. Jefferson allowed the two eldest to \\"escape\\", and freed the two youngest in his will. As adults, three of the Jefferson‚ÄìHemings children passed into white society: Beverly (male) and Harriet Hemings in the Washington, DC area, and Eston Hemings Jefferson in Wisconsin. He had married a mixed-race woman in Virginia, and both their sons served as regular Union soldiers. The oldest gained the rank of colonel. Historians had long discounted rumors that Jefferson had this relationship. But in 1998, a Y-DNA test confirmed that a contemporary male descendant of Sally Hemings (through Eston Heming's descendants) was a direct, genetic descendant of the male line of Jeffersons. It was Thomas Jefferson who was documented as having been at Monticello each time Hemings conceived, and the weight of historical evidence favored his paternity.\\"Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account\\", Monticello Website, Thomas Jefferson Foundation, accessed 22 June 2011.

As a class, they intermarried, sometimes gained formal education, and owned property, including slaves.Kolchin, Peter American Slavery, 1619‚Äì1865, New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, pp. 82‚Äì83. Moreover, in the Upper South, some slaveholders freed their slaves after the Revolution through manumission. The population of free black men and free black women rose from less than one percent in 1780 to more than ten percent in 1810, when 7.2 percent of Virginia's population was free black people, and 75 percent of Delaware's black population were free.Kolchin, American Slavery, p. 81. Concerning the sexual hypocrisy related to whites and their sexual abuse of enslaved women, the diarist Mary Boykin Chesnut said: > This only I see: like the patriarchs of old our men live all in one house > with their wives and their concubines, the Mulattoes one sees in every > family exactly resemble the white children ‚Äî every lady tells you who is the > father of all the Mulatto children in every body's household, but those > [Mulatto children] in her own [household], she seems to think drop from the > clouds or pretends so to think. . . . Likewise, in the Journal of a Residence on a Georgia Plantation in 1838‚Äì1839 (1863), Fanny Kemble, the English wife of an American planter, noted the immorality of white slave owners who kept their mixed-race children enslaved. But some white fathers established common-law marriages with enslaved women. They manumitted the woman and children, or sometimes transferred property to them, arranged apprenticeships and education, and resettled in the North. Some white fathers paid for higher education of their mixed-race children at colour-blind colleges, such as Oberlin College. In 1860 Ohio, at Wilberforce University (est. 1855) owned and operated by the African Methodist Episcopal church, most of the two hundred subscribed students were mixed-race, natural sons of the white men paying their tuition.

Web search engine ability in a mobile form allows users to find mobile content on websites which are available to mobile devices on mobile networks. As this happens mobile content shows a media shift toward mobile multimedia. Simply put, mobile search is not just a spatial shift of PC web search to mobile equipment, but is witnessing more of treelike branching into specialized segments of mobile broadband and mobile content, both of which show a fast- paced evolution.  Market description  \\"Competition for the US mobile search market promises to be fierce, thanks to the large US online ad market and strong pushes by portals. By 2019, mobile ad spending will rise to $65.87 billion, or 72.2% of total digital ad spend\\", according to a leading market research firm; eMarketer. Depending on a researcher's particular bias toward telecom, Web or technology factors, the published forecasts for global mobile search vary from $1.5 billion by 2011 (from Informa Telecoms & Media) to over $11 billion by 2008 (according to Piper Jaffray). Mobile search is important for the usability of mobile content for the same reasons as internet search engines became important to the usability of internet content. Early internet content was largely provided by portals such as Netscape. As the depth of available content grew, portals were unable to provide total coverage. As a result, Internet web search engines such as Google and AltaVista proved popular as a way of allowing users to find the increasingly specialist content they were looking for. In an international journal article, 'Exploring the logic of mobile search', Westlund, G√≥mez-Barroso, Compa√±√≥, and Feij√≥o(2011) outline a thorough review of research on mobile search usage, and also present an in-depth study of user patterns. They conclude that mobile search has started to change mobile media consumption patterns radically. They also emphasize that future developments of mobile search must be sensitive to the mobile logic.  Types  Within the broad umbrella of mobile search (the ability to browse for mobile specific content), there are a range of services. Given the relative immaturity of the market, not all of these can be expected to become the industry standards. Mobile optimized search engines Most major search engines have implemented a mobile optimized version of their products that take into consideration bandwidth and form factor limitations of the mobile platform. For example, Google has launched a mobile-friendly version of their search engine. The algorithms for mobile search engine results are thought to be evolving and aspects such as location and predictive searching will become increasingly important. Google just released its latest 160 page Full Search Quality Raters Guide\\"Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines\\" How Search Works November 12, 2015. with a new emphasis on Mobile and Usefulness. Mobile question and answer services These services allow a user to text a question to a central database and receive a reply using text. A usage example would be a user that wants to know the answer to a very specific question but is not in front of his/her computer. Most mobile 'Q&A;' services are powered by human researchers and are therefore a type of organic search engine. A new approach by AskMeNow and MobileBits is to use Semantic Web technology to automate the process. Mobile directory search This service is known by different names dependent on country and operator. It can also be known as 'Find My Nearest' or 'Mobile Yellow Pages' services. The basics of the services allow users to find local services in the vicinity of their current location. The services often use location-based technology to pinpoint exactly where the user currently is. An example of usage would be a user looking for a local cab or taxi company after a night out. Services also usually come with a map and directions to help the user. An example is the service offered by Yell in the UK which is powered by MobilePeople's technology. Mobile discovery services These services offer users recommendations on what they should do next. An example would be recommending a user a similar ringtone to the one that s/he has just browsed for. They operate, in a mobile context, in a similar way to the recommendation engines provided by internet retail shops such as Amazon.com. An example of real usage is the Directory Enquiries (DQ) service operated by Orange in the UK. Callers to the Orange landline DQ service are given the business and residential numbers they have requested verbally by an operator. In addition, Orange sends the information in text format to the users mobile phone. The information contains a text reminder of the requested information as well as links to local businesses, services and other interesting information in the local area that the user has searched on. Mobile navigation services These services provide the indexing structure to the portals provided by mobile operators. They index the content already on the operators' portal but also provide users access to mobile specific content that is available outside the confines of the portal. Dynamic mobile selection interface services A new category of mobile search tool that is emerging is one in which a pre-selected set of possible search content is downloaded in advance by a mobile user and then allows for a final internet search step. An example of such search tools is the Worldport Navigator for the iPhone, which provides users with a push- button experience of selecting from thousands of human-screened and categorized Web selections in three or four seconds, without the need for text entry, search, result review, or page-scrolling.

The U.S. Forest Service has a firefighting air tanker base here. The airport was served by TWA and Frontier Airlines but now sees no airline service.  History  The airport was built in 1929 by Transcontinental Air Transport (TAT). Aviator Charles Lindbergh, who served as head of TAT's Technical Committee, chose Winslow as one of twelve critical refueling stops on the nation's first transcontinental passenger line. For many years it was the only all-weather airport between Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Los Angeles, California. In 1930 TAT merged with Western Air Express and the new carrier became Trans Continental and Western Air, or TWA. Ford Trimotor aircraft were first used followed by the Douglas DC-2 in 1934 and the Douglas DC-3 in 1937. During World War II the airfield was used by the United States Army Air Forces Air Transport Command as a refueling and repair stop for military aircraft. The airport is dedicated to the memory of Melvin L. Kislingbury, a Winslow resident who was killed in a WW II flight mission in Louisiana in 1943.History of the Winslow‚ÄìLindbergh Regional Airport TWA's last scheduled flight to Winslow was in 1953. Arizona Airways served the city in the late 1940s and merged to become Frontier Airlines in 1950. Frontier served Winslow as one of several stops along a Denver to Phoenix and an Albuquerque to Phoenix route and service continued until 1974. The city was then served by several commuter airlines with flights to Phoenix and Albuquerque until the late 1980s. These included Cochise Airlines, Desert Airlines, Sun West Airlines, and Golden Pacific Airlines.Airline timetables Facilities The historic Winslow‚ÄìLindbergh Regional Airport, built in 1929 The airport covers at an elevation of .

His parents died when he was two years old and his sister, Amelia, and her husband, Van Stevens, moved the family to Portland. Haskell graduated from Deering High School. Determined to be a lawyer, he graduated from the Peabody Law School in 1934 and was admitted to the Maine bar. For the remainder of his life he maintained his legal office in downtown Portland. In 1943, Haskell was elected to the Maine House of Representatives and was reelected in 1945, 1947, and 1949 when he served as Speaker of the House. Elected to the Maine Senate in 1951, he was reelected in 1953 and in that same year elected President of the Senate. Haskell's brief term of Governor was the result of constitutional succession in the wake of the 1952 elections. The outgoing Governor, Frederick G. Payne, resigned early to begin preparing to take his new seat in the United States Senate. With Maine having no lieutenant governor, the President of the Senate is next in the line of succession. At the time of Payne's resignation, Burton M. Cross became Governor by virtue of holding that office. However, Cross had also been elected Governor; his elected term was scheduled to begin on January 7, 1953. At 10:00am on January 6, 1953, Cross's term as Senate President (and therefore Governor) expired. Haskell, as the newly elected president, became Governor until the inaugural ceremony was held at 11:00am the next day.http://www.bangordailynews.com/detail/110921.html He was not closely related to Robert Haskell, another Senate President who briefly became governor in between the terms of a prior one and a newly elected one.

The third cornerback or safety on defense is known as a nickelback. The dimeback position is essentially relegated to backup cornerbacks and safeties who do not play starting cornerback or safety positions. Dimebacks are usually fast players because they must be able to keep up on passing plays with 3+ wide receivers. Dimebacks are brought into the game when the defense uses a dime formation, which uses six defensive backs rather than four or five.

In Canada, this game is known as Relievio; that name was also used in Boston and Ireland in the 1950s. It is also, in some places, known as coco-levio. Emmett Grogan wrote a fictionalized autobiography called Ringolevio, which was published in 1972. Echoing the memories of hundreds of thousands who grew up in the neighborhoods of New York, Grogan wrote: \\"It's a game. A game played on the streets of New York, for as long as anyone can remember. It is called Ringolevio, and the rules are simple. There are two sides, each with the same number of players. There are no time limits, no intermissions, no substitutes and no weapons allowed. There are two jails. There is one objective.\\"Grogan, Ringolevio, 3. The first chapter of this autobiography describes a particularly serious game of ringolevio played by Grogan and his gang. It seems likely that the game was brought over from the British Isles; it is very similar to a game that is called Bedlams or Relievo. According to Stewart Culin, relievo became ring relievo and then ringoleavio. A similar game, called Prisoner's Base, was played by members of Lewis & Clark's Corps of Discovery against a group of Nez Perce.Sunday 8th June 1806. the 2 men returned from the villages. a number of the natives visited us and gave Frazer a fine young horse a number of the natives joined and got out our canoe which was Sank. our party exercised themselves running and playing games called base in the evening danced after the fiddle as the Indians were anxious to See them.  The rules of the game  There are two teams. In one version, one team goes off and hides. The other team counts to a predetermined number and then proceeds to search for the first team. In another version, the two teams simultaneously attempt to capture all the members of the opposing team; each team has its own \\"jail\\", perhaps a park bench or other defensible turf. In Bay Terrace, Queens, both teams had a park bench jail; the winner was whichever team could capture all of the other team's members. Often, the game would go on so long that it was called on account of darkness. Anyone on the pursuing side can catch anyone on the pursued side by grabbing hold of them and chanting \\"Chain chain double chain, no break away.\\" (In the Briarwood & Bay Terrace, Queens, neighborhoods in the 1960s and 1970s, the required chant was \\"Ringolevio, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3!\\") If the person pursued breaks free at any point during this brief recitation, the person is not caught and is considered still \\"in\\". If caught, the pursuer takes the prisoner to an area called the jail (the area was called the base in some variations) and the captive is considered \\"out\\". Jail is any confined area, a porch or stoop (the front steps of a townhouse or Brownstone) or a space between two parked cars or bushes where members of the pursued team are accumulated. Any IN member of a team, can free all OUT team members in jail by barging into the jail without being caught, tagging the captives and shouting, \\"All in! All in! Free-all!\\" or \\"Home Free-all\\" in the Bronx. This means that all members of the team that were in jail are now free and have to be recaught, as they are then back in the game. Many corruptions of the \\"all in, all in, all in, free allo\\" (such as \\"Olly olly oxen free\\") call at the end of game (when the other side gives up) have been concocted through the past century (not surprising, as the game's rules are passed by word of mouth from older to younger children), but when the jail is lacking just one or two opponents for a full win, the opposing team must concede defeat by announcing that the game is over and that all who were caught are in for free. Then the game starts again. In some variations, the pursuing team cannot station any player of their team within line of sight of the jail. This is called \\"babysitting\\" (\\"puppy-guarding\\" is used in some areas). The cry of \\"babysitting\\" can be made by anyone in the jail who feels that any member of the opposing team is lingering near the jail and blocking their rescue. Game ends when one team has caught all the members of the opposing team, at which point the captured team changes roles and now counts while the opponents hide. Coordinated attacks to free the jail often employ military strategy in their use of terrain and engage in flanking maneuvers and feints that resemble battlefield tactics. The game itself, though, is rarely violent and fights are rare as all the running generally makes both the pursuer and pursued weak with laughter at the point of capture. Each round of ringolevio lasts about half an hour, but the actual duration of play is a factor of the boundaries of play agreed to at the start of the game as well as the number of players on each side. Games often have set boundaries of how far from the jail pursued players can go. Some games have been played with citywide boundaries with up to 40 players. These games had rounds lasting for weeks with suspension of play for half an hour before, during and after school hours. Winners have been accused of going \\"off the block\\" when their strategy left them undetected in a one- city-block game. If you strike \\"the pose of invisibility\\", you may go unnoticed in an obvious place. One other variation allows the players in jail to extend out of the jail by holding hands, making it easier to be freed by teammates. \\"Electricity\\" conducts the tag of the savior to the last player tied to the jail through the chain of held hands.  Other variants  In some neighborhoods of New York, the same game was called Ringolario.In some neighborhoods, the name changed over time. That's what it was called on Staten Island and in the housing projects on East 92nd Street in Manhattan. Another version of Ringolario reached the suburbs of southeastern Pennsylvania around 1970. Two or three neighborhood properties (yards) were set to be the boundaries. The front porch of a home was used as the jail. Sneaking through shrubbery around the porch added to the surprise when team members freed their jailed teammates. The game was played at dusk and often lasted long after dark on summer evenings which added to the military nature of the game. Players would sometimes dress in dark clothes to elude capture. The rules required that the captor cry 1-2-3 Ringolario after grabbing or sometimes tackling (on grass) the pursued. In Northeast Philadelphia, the variation played was called \\"Freedom.\\" Players were captured by being taken hold of long enough to say \\"1-2-3 come with me, you're my prisoner.\\" or \\"1-2-3 you're my man, no breaksies, safety lock\\" or, in suburban Philadelphia it was, \\"1-2-3 your my man that breaks no holds.\\" Players were released from the base/jail when a member of their team was able to sneak close enough to touch a team member and cry \\"Freedom!\\" at which point all members of the team rush out in a bunch to make it as difficult as possible for the jail-keeper to recapture them. The jail was a railed porch (the railing looking like the bars of a jail and providing a single approach to guard.) In Olney, this variation was much more aptly named, \\"Spring!\\" This game was called Spring, as in Spring out of jail, in some Catholic schoolyards in North Philadelphia during the early 1960s and at least through the 1980s. \\"Spring!\\" is all that needed to be yelled as the pursued team member touched the base to release all his members out of jail by running in uncaptured. At Saint Henry parish, which was located at 5th and Cayuga, the words used by the pursuing team to capture a member of the pursued team was \\"One, Two, Three Your My Man, no breaksies\\". The jail was simply a large metal grate on the ground of one end of the schoolyard. The jail was protected from Springing by members standing in front of the grate. In a twist not noted elsewhere, the pursued team had a safe place where they could not be captured by simply holding on to a window grate over a window at the other end of the schoolyard. Also, if a pursued team member was holding on to the safety area and they in turn were holding hands with a team member not touching the safety grid, that team member was also safe because of \\"Electricity\\". At a summer resort in Ulster County ca. 1968-76, the game was called \\"slip\\", the call required to secure a capture was \\"slip one two three\\", the detention area was \\"base\\", the play area was a two-acre premise, and considerable time was spent debating the rules that would apply, including the permissibility of \\"base sitting\\", i.e. \\"babysitting\\" as described above. The base was a swingset and each player detained at the base was generally required to be in physical contact with it. As above, the games generally started around dusk and could continue for hours after dark. While rough play, anger or fighting could occasionally occur, weakness with laughter, or sheer fatigue, would often accompany physical contact between players as indicated above. During this same era, in Kingston, also in Ulster County, the game was also called \\"slip\\" and involved (at least in the Rondout, New York neighborhood) by having the seeking team members visually identify a hiding team member using the word \\"dow\\" and stating the players name and where seen‚Äîe.g., \\"Dow Hank behind the Hahn's garage!\\" If the seeking player had correctly identified the hiding member's hiding place, that player came and out and went to the jail area to await possible rescue by a teammate or the call of \\"Olly Olly Oxen Free!!!\\" to end the round if the seeking team had given up. In Boston and suburbs, players were captured by being taken hold of long enough to say \\"1-2-3 caught by me, no Relievio rest\\". Guarding the jail was accepted and one or more members of the pursued team would maneuver to lure the guard away, who was eager to fill his or her jail. If a pursued team member made it into the jail without getting caught, he would yell \\"Relievio\\" or \\"1-2-3 freed by me\\", to free the captured players. This person could then run away with his teammates or declare \\"Relievio rest\\", and remain in the jail to rest, immune from capture. Also, even when the jail was empty, any pursued team member could use the jail declaring \\"Relievio rest\\" to rest unbothered by pursuers. If the jail filled with captured players while at rest, the player would have to leave and come back to free them. \\"Electricity\\" was a seldom used feature of the game, with it being part of the rules decided upon at the beginning of the game. In Chicago, during the 1950s, when the game was still in process, and we all had to go home and stop .... the unfound hidden players would come out only after the searching team would shout out: \\"Oli Oli Ocean, Free for Bobby (the names of the still hidden players).\\" In India, the game is generally played by kids in apartment complexes under the name \\"Cops and Robbers\\". There is no way for the other players to know that the game has ended, so one must stealthily come out of their hiding place to check whether the game is over, and if it is not, make their way back to the hiding place. In popular culture In addition to Grogan's eponymous book, the game is mentioned in Films * The PBS documentary, New York Street Games (2010), featured Ringolevio as one of the games popular in New York City. * In the film \\"Fallen\\" John Goodman shouts \\"Olly Olly Oxen Free O\\" upon encountering Denzel Washington.

Notes and references Notes Citations Further reading * Category:Cultural history of New York City Category:Children's games Category:Street games Category:Tag variants In the 1950s‚Äì1960s, in the Bronx, many times we would sneak away to have lunch and then re-enter the game w/o anyone knowing. Hiding places were an important part of the game as was who were the very fastest runners.(Once, hiding under a bread truck it drove off and I was almost caught, almost). Also important, the ability to hold onto someone while saying ringelivio 1-2-3 3X or the ability to break away. Never saw a fight, just tugging. Once we had almost fifty on each side, summer days in Clason Point. Also, try tricking the other side into thinking you're actually on their side, never worked, because usually when searching for the other team we'd try to go out in pairs and one of us would know who was on the other team. Great all day game. ","title":"Ringolevio"},{"id":"3809903","text":"Central‚ÄìMid-levels escalators crossing Wellington Street.

Jigsaw made his debut in the first film of the series, Saw, and he later appeared in all subsequent sequels. He is portrayed by American actor Tobin Bell. In the series' narrative, John is a former civil engineer dying from an inoperable frontal lobe tumor that had developed from colon cancer. After a suicide attempt, John found a new appreciation for his life, and decided to dedicate the rest of his life to inspiring the same appreciation in others by testing their will to live. His methods include forcing his subjects through deadly scenarios, which he referred to as \\"games\\" or \\"tests\\", in which they were forced to inflict pain upon themselves or others in order to escape. These tests were typically symbolic of what Jigsaw perceived as a flaw in each person's moral character or life. The Jigsaw name was given to him by the media for his practice of cutting a puzzle piece-shaped chunk of flesh from those who fail. Fictional character biography Jigsaw was introduced in the 2004 film Saw through Lawrence Gordon's recounting of his first killings. Jigsaw is described as a mysterious person who kidnaps people he believes take their lives for granted and subjects them to \\"tests\\", usually mechanical devices rigged to maim or kill the subjects if they fail to complete it within a certain time period. Unlike most killers, Jigsaw never intends to kill his subjects; the purpose of his traps is to see if the subject has the will to live, as he hopes their experience will teach them the value of life, although he sometimes places his victims in situations where they themselves must kill others in order to follow the terms that he sets. In John's mind the deaths of those that fail are justified, because those who fail to do what is necessary to survive don't deserve to live. As his victims increase, the media dubs him The Jigsaw Killer, or simply Jigsaw, because of the jigsaw puzzle-shaped piece of flesh that he removes from unsuccessful subjects, which he explains in Saw II is meant to symbolize that the subject \\"was missing a vital piece of the human puzzle: the survival instinct\\". Throughout the first film, his identity remains uncertain; the unstable ex-cop David Tapp suspects that he may be Lawrence and near the end of the film, Lawrence and Adam Stanheight are led to believe it is the hospital orderly Zep Hindle. Only at the end of the film is it revealed that the Jigsaw Killer is a terminal cancer patient of Lawrence's named John Kramer, who spent the entire time posing as a corpse on the floor of the bathroom Adam and Lawrence were trapped in. Much of John's backstory was revealed in Saw II. He had gone in for a routine medical examination when he learned from Lawrence that he was dying of colon cancer with an inoperable brain tumor. Depressed by this news, John drove himself off a cliff. He survived the suicide attempt, and subsequently began his life's \\"work\\" of testing others' will to live. Though he never encouraged the name, John eventually earned the nickname The Jigsaw Killer. In spite of the intentions he had while conducting his work, he did not consider himself to be a \\"killer\\" or \\"murderer\\" because rather than killing his victims outright, he trapped them in situations from which they could escape by inflicting severe physical torture upon themselves or by killing other victims. Also, despite the immense brutality of his games, John took no pleasure in the suffering of his victims, but thought that it was necessary to remind them to be grateful for the gift of life. In Saw II, John leaves a clue to his location at the scene of a game. When the police apprehend him, John places Detective Eric Matthews in a test of his own, revealing Eric's son Daniel is trapped in a house filled with a deadly nerve gas, along with several people who, although far from innocent, had previously been framed by Eric for crimes they did not commit. Jigsaw offers to let his son survive if the detective simply talks to him for two hours until the game is complete. Eric eventually loses patience, and after assaulting John, Eric forces him to lead him to the house at gunpoint. It is later revealed that the events in the house took place before they found John, and his son was locked in a safe the whole time. Upon their arrival, Jigsaw is rescued by Amanda Young (previously introduced in Saw), who, having survived her trap, sees John not only as a savior, but as a mentor and father figure. By Saw III, John is on his death bed and extremely concerned over whether or not Amanda has what it takes to continue his legacy, as the traps she designs are inescapable. In his desperation, Jigsaw administers a final test to her, in order to see if she was truly capable of carrying on his legacy. Meanwhile, Dr. Lynn Denlon is forced to keep John alive, while her vengeful husband, Jeff, undergoes tests of forgiveness. John attempts to keep Amanda from failing her test, however, after breaking down, she admits that she no longer believes in Jigsaw's philosophy, and shoots Dr. Denlon. Witnessing this, Jeff kills Amanda by shooting her in the neck. After explaining that this is Jeff's final test of forgiveness, Jeff slices John's throat with a power saw. As he dies, Jigsaw pulls out a tape player, explaining that he has abducted Corbett, Jeff's daughter, and if he wants to get her back he will have to participate in another game. Saw IV opens with John's autopsy, during which a wax-coated tape is found in his stomach. The tape revealed to Detective Mark Hoffman that he would not go untested. The end of the film reveals that Hoffman is in fact another one of Jigsaw's accomplices. Saw IV also explored Jigsaw's history, more so than previously done in Saw II. From the story given in Saw IV, John was a successful civil engineer who got into property development, and was a devoted husband to his wife Jill Tuck who ran a recovery clinic for drug users, with the motto \\"Cherish Your Life\\". After the reckless actions of a patient named Cecil Adams resulted in the loss of John's unborn child, John became detached and angry, which eventually led to their divorce. After being diagnosed with cancer and attempting suicide, as seen in Saw II, John began his work, and abducted Cecil as his first test subject, while wearing the first version of his iconic pig mask. John reappears in flashbacks in Saw V which detail his first encounter with Mark Hoffman, and explores their relationship; Hoffman initially killed his sister's murderer with an inescapable trap mimicking Jigsaw's. Furious, John blackmailed Hoffman into becoming his apprentice as a way of redemption, although Hoffman eventually became a willing apprentice. John also appears in a video will in which he declares his love for Jill, and leaves her a mysterious box. John also appears through flashbacks in Saw VI. One flashback set prior to the events of the first film shows that it was Amanda Young who convinced Cecil to steal drugs from Jill's clinic, inadvertently causing her miscarriage, and John's transformation into The Jigsaw Killer. More flashbacks set prior to the events of the first film reveal that John targeted health insurance executive William Easton for one of his games, because he had denied two-thirds of all applicants health coverage, due to a flawed policy, including John himself. In the present time of Saw VI, John shows himself on video twice to Easton instead of the Billy Puppet (the method John usually used to speak to his subjects), so Easton could look in the eyes of someone he let die, as he underwent tests in which he was forced to decide which of his co-workers would live or die. In another flashback, this time set between the events of the first and second film, John presents Amanda to Jill as proof that his \\"rehabilitation\\" works. A flashback set just before the events of the third and fourth films explores the group dynamic between John, Amanda Young, and Mark Hoffman. John criticizes Hoffman for his brutal approach, and lack of compassion for the subjects. It was also shown that John seemed to have had a closer emotional attachment to Amanda Young than Hoffman. Shortly afterward, John gave his ex-wife a key, which she later used to open the box he gave her in Saw V. In the present, it is revealed that the box contained six envelopes containing future test subjects, a thicker envelope, and an updated version of the \\"Reverse Bear Trap\\". She gave Hoffman envelopes 1 to 5, but hid everything else and later delivered the thick envelope to an unknown person at the hospital. Envelope 6 was intended for Jill to carry out alone, and as per John's instructions she placed Hoffman in the \\"Reverse Bear Trap\\"; fulfilling the promise made, via the audio tape discovered in John's stomach during his autopsy in Saw IV that Hoffman would not go untested. Bell reprises his role as John in Saw 3D. He is seen in a flashback meeting Bobby Dagen, a man who acquired quick fame and fortune after falsifying a story about surviving a Jigsaw trap. Hoffman later makes Bobby go through a series of tests in which he comes face-to-face with those who knew he lied (except his wife), but refused to expose his secret; all are killed in separate traps despite his efforts to save them. John appears at the end of the film, where it was revealed that after Lawrence escaped the bathroom, John found him unconscious, and nursed him back to health. John subsequently recruited Lawrence, considering him to be his greatest asset. He assisted John in many of his traps since then. The contents of the package Jill left at the hospital in Saw VI was shown to be a video tape intended for Lawrence, in which John instructs him to watch over Jill, and to act on John's behalf if anything was to happen to her. It is implied that John knew Hoffman would go rogue and stray from his ideals and wanted him to be punished. After Jill is killed by Hoffman, Lawrence fulfills his request by assaulting Hoffman and sealing him in the bathroom from the first film. In Jigsaw, recordings of the character's voice are heard as descriptions of the tests that five victims must face in an abandoned barn. He appears in person during the final test, confronting its two participants with the truth of their past misdeeds. After loading a double-barreled shotgun with one shell that he describes as \\"your key to freedom\\", he leaves the room. It is later revealed that this test took place ten years ago, and that Jigsaw chose one of the five victims to become his first apprentice; the victim was the doctor who accidentally misdiagnosed John's cancer until it was too late to be treated, but when he missed a chance to escape the first trap because he was unconscious, John decided that the man did not deserve to die because of an \\"honest mistake\\", and recruited him to be his first apprentice. In other media=Saw: Rebirth The character of John Kramer is also featured in the non-canon comic book Saw: Rebirth, which is set prior to the events of the first film. It filled in some of his history, showing him as a toy designer at Standard Engineering Ltd. who was too lazy to do much with his life, ultimately ending his relationship with Jill. Saw: Rebirth also reveals John's discovery that he had terminal cancer and outlined how his subsequent suicide attempt impacted his train of thought. His relationships with Dr. Lawrence Gordon, Zep Hindle, Paul Leahy, Amanda Young, and Mark Wilson were explored, along with his transformation into Jigsaw. Rebirth's continuity was ultimately contradicted by the backstory presented in Saw IV. Saw: The Video Game Tobin Bell reprises his role as the voice of Jigsaw in the Saw video game. He is shown on television screens dressed in his signature robes setting up traps for people and preaching his lesson of life appreciation to them. He frequently advises and taunts Detective Tapp as he traverses through an abandoned insane asylum, usually by way of the Billy puppet. Saw II: Flesh & Blood Tobin Bell reprised his role as the voice of the Jigsaw Killer in the Saw: The Video Game sequel Saw II: Flesh & Blood. Tobin Bell also sold his likeness for the Jigsaw Killer, who actually appears in the game. Jigsaw tests Detective Tapp's estranged son Michael, who is wanting to get to the bottom of his father's death. Jigsaw personally taunts Michael throughout the game, always being out of reach. Via case files, it is also revealed that he built nearly half of the city (explaining his numerous hideouts in the series). He appears to seek the destruction of the drug cartel run by corrupt cops. In the ending, he faces either Michael (tempting him into becoming another apprentice) or Campbell (offering him freedom but forced to lure him into a lethal trap when he tries to attack him). Characterization Actor Tobin Bell in 2007 The producers of the Saw films have fought to differentiate the Jigsaw Killer from other horror film killers. Darren Lynn Bousman, the director of Saw II, Saw III, and Saw IV, has stated on the character's role \\"He's not Jason or Freddy. He's not even Hannibal Lecter. He's a person with extreme beliefs and he really thinks he's making a difference. He's a vigilante if anything. He thinks he's making a difference.\\" Tobin Bell, the actor who plays Jigsaw, describes his character's role as being more of a scientist or engineer and \\"he thinks very specifically and very pragmatically\\". About Jigsaw's games being detail- oriented, Bell said: \\"My sense is that Jigsaw is so detail oriented that I think he thinks in terms of worst case scenario. I think he's a very good judge of character, so his sense that, for example, that Detective Matthews was going to play right into his trap, which he did, was right on. Now, it seems to me that he's always got a second plan in place. And there's probably been a number of second plans. I mean, we've only seen three movies. Maybe there are six more somewhere where he failed, where something didn't play out\\". Speaking about playing the character, Bell stated that \\"[y]ou have to think of someone like Jigsaw from a very specific point of view. He doesn't view himself as some kind of diabolical psychotic. You know there's a little bit of evil in everyone. It just gets carried further. Most of us have some sort of moral fiber that restricts that. Some framework. And then others because of their lives and what happens to them, the thing develops in some other way.\\" Bousman mentioned that Saw III was intended to contain a scene in which Jigsaw showed remorse for his actions after seeing the results of his legacy: > \\"For the first time, we actually see him break down and cry. Imagine your > entire life's work. You're on your deathbed. You know there's nothing else > you can do and here's how you'll be remembered: as a killer, as a murderer. > Not as someone who helped people. Not as someone who changed lives. Someone > who took away lives. The one thing he didn't want to be and, as he's on his > deathbed, he's realizing this.\\" As a result of his cancer and suicide attempt, John decided to dedicate the rest of his life to teaching people to appreciate their own lives. The producers of Saw III and director Darren Lynn Bousman see Jigsaw,Saw III: Audio Commentary not as a serial killer, but a \\"scientist\\" who is determined to initiate the survival instinct in his \\"subjects\\", believing that humanity no longer uses its instinct of survival.Saw II: Jigsaw Lecture scene While the character's discovery that he has cancer is acknowledged to be the \\"final straw\\" that drove him to his actions, Bell has stated in an interview that \\"His terminal cancer is one of the elements of his life but he's as angry over the fact the world is going to hell in handbasket because it's no longer the survival of the fittest; it's the survival of the mediocre. That drives him as much as anything else. He doesn't just talk about his frustrations, he does something about them, and he puts himself on the line. His cancer was about one element in about 130 elements that caused him to create the world that he's created.\\" Jigsaw is depicted in the Saw films as being extremely cunning and intelligent. In Saw: Rebirth, he is depicted doing extensive study in multiple fields to gain knowledge for designing his tests, and recurring director Bousman himself has described Jigsaw as being \\"extremely educated\\" in an interview. Symbolic representations=Traps In the series, John usually builds deadly traps for his subjects, which are often a symbolic representation of what Jigsaw perceives as a flaw in the person's life. John calls these tests \\"games\\", and tells the person the \\"rules\\" of the game usually by microcasette or video tape. The rules are tasks that the person must perform in order to pass the test and survive; however, the tasks often involve extreme self-mutilation (although there have been occasions where it is possible for the subject not to harm themself if they are bright enough, such as the \\"Razor Box Trap\\" in Saw II). Most of the traps are made of scavenged materials, rusty bolts, decaying iron, or anything else he thinks will help him create a new \\"game\\". However, not all of the traps require self- mutilation, as one trap actually required a man (Jeff) to burn his deceased son's toys to get the key to save the second victim (which was psychological torture and therefore forced him to burn the memory of his son to save the victim). Many of the games involve clocks, counting down timers or other measured time constraints provided to the victims. Jigsaw elaborated in Saw II his appreciation of \\"time\\", outlining the importance of savoring every moment. He also stated his belief that telling someone the time in which they may die would awaken an alertness for every moment of existence. Jake Huntley wrote of the complexity of Jigsaw's character in the Irish Journal of Gothic and Horror Studies. Huntley described the intention behind John's actions, and evaluated the extent to which they can be analyzed to fit into the philosophies associated with Deleuze, Darwin, and Nietzsche: > \\"The subject of one of Jigsaw's games is therefore always presented with an > opportunity, the aim of which is to reinvigorate the potential of the > subject, jump-start the survival instinct and instill a celebration or > \\"savoring\\" of life. In Deleuzian terms, it is the potential of life that is > at stake... It is this that gives Jigsaw's games their Deleuzian tone, the > urgent revitalisation of life occasioning new experiences to be learnt and > assimilated: such as the perverse, singular and aberrant situation of waking > to find a man-trap secured around your neck. There is then the instruction > to live or die, to make your choice, to survive the encounter with affect, > or the affection-image... There is no thrill, sadistic or otherwise, in > setting these games; they are throws of the die by the subjects, aleatoric > opportunities...

The decisions, > the choices, the selection of a potential, are in the hands of the subjects > of his games and he only intervenes in order to keep the game within its > rules so a decision can be reached. The subjects are faced with a shocking > choice that forces them to acknowledge what Deleuze identifies as the > virtual ‚Äì that is, the unacknowledged aspects of our experience with > reality. This, in effect, is the particular game that Jigsaw himself plays; > one where the organism might be failing but the flow of desire succeeds and > endures. Jigsaw might resort to discussing Darwin's \\"little trip to the > Galapagos Islands\\" to provide a theoretical underpinning for his project and > echo Nietzsche in talking of the will to survive, but this merely misdirects > investigators and witnesses in the same way that the gruesome traps and > freely flowing gore earn him his unsettling serial killer soubriquet. > Jigsaw's games are designed to crack open the world of their respective > players: the challenges are nearly always relevant to the subject's > lifestyle in a symbolic or literal way, bringing them to painful self > awareness, prompting a reappraisal of their squandered potential.\\" John intends through these traps to force his victims to prove to him that they are \\"worthy\\" and \\"deserving\\" to continue living, and also for them to learn to abandon what he perceives to be their vices. He often expressed a desire for his victims to succeed, but stressed that their fate was always in their own hands. The video and audio tape instructions for his games often echo this idea: \\"Live or die. Make your choice.\\" Billy, a puppet, is an icon of the Jigsaw character. John often used it for the purpose of delivering messages to his victims via a television screen, but at times it has also been physically present with the victims during their tests. He provided the (disguised) voice for Billy when it delivered its messages. It is shown in Saw IV that the original puppet was created by John Kramer as an intended toy for his unborn son, who died while Cecil Adams was robbing the clinic; Cecil accidentally pushed the door into Jill, which resulted in Gideon's death. John is shown constructing the more menacing Billy puppet in Saw III for the purpose of its inclusion in his \\"games\\". Microcassettes Another of Jigsaw's trademarks is his use of microcassettes to deliver instructions to his victims, disguising his voice as on the Billy videotapes. A flashback in Saw IV reveals that he accomplished this by speaking into a reel-to-reel tape recorder, then slowing down the playback. Often, a victim would find a microcassette recorder left for him or her with a tape already loaded in, while at other times the tape would be found separately in an envelope marked with the victim's name or the tape on its own reading \\"Play Me\\". One tape was found in Jigsaw's stomach during his autopsy at the beginning of Saw IV, coated in wax to protect it against his digestive acids. Both of his apprentices, Amanda Young and Mark Hoffman, eventually began making their own microcassettes, but not always altering their voices as he did. In Saw 3D, Hoffman recorded one set of instructions on a standard-sized cassette, and another on an 8-track tape for use in a car stereo. Huntley remarked that Jigsaw's voice recordings operated for a specific purpose as part of Jigsaw's M.O. Huntley stated that it allowed Jigsaw to be present there not as \\"a participant or even a spectator but instead as a referee, observing the rules pertinent to that particular subject rather than salaciously enjoying the 'victim's agony'.\\" Pig mask The pig mask is a thematic prop worn by Jigsaw and his accomplices throughout the Saw film series to conceal their identities while abducting their \\"test subjects\\". As the series continues, the purpose of the pig mask is explored in detail; it is explained to be a tribute to the \\"Year of the Pig\\", the year in which Jigsaw started his work. The origin of the pig mask was shown in Saw IV, revealing the first known pig masks to have been latex strap-on masks used at a Year of the Pig Chinese New Year festival. Jigsaw had snatched them and donned one, while using the other one to hold his chloroform-soaked rag. The second mask was then used to knock out his first test subject, Cecil, by placing the mask over his head with the chloroform rag still inside. When working on the original Saw film, writer Leigh Whannell and director James Wan wanted their antagonist to have some sort of mask. After some discussion, the idea of Jigsaw wearing a rotting pig's head was chosen to symbolize his pessimistic view of the world and the disease that he was \\"rotting\\" from. Amanda wearing the Pig Mask. Nevertheless, the mask given to them from production (a rubber Halloween mask) was considered by them to be less than satisfactory. A number of things were added to make it look more gruesome, including long black hair and pus running from its eyes and nostrils. Whannell has still admitted to being disappointed with its final appearance compared to his intended one, but has admitted that the mask has since become one of the \\"staples\\" of the Saw franchise. Along with Billy and perhaps Jigsaw himself, the mask has since become one of the more iconic symbols of the franchise. It has appeared on both the posters for the first film and the fourth. The mask has also been featured on many forms of merchandise. Officially licensed pig mask accessories have been sold for Halloween. In addition, the mask has been featured on numerous Jigsaw action figures. NECA has released two Jigsaw figurines with the pig mask; the original was Jigsaw wearing the mask in his black cloak, and a Saw III variant of Jigsaw wearing it in his red cloak. In addition, the Be@rBrick line has released a \\"bear\\" version of Jigsaw wearing the pig mask. Medicom has also released a figurine of Jigsaw wearing his infamous pig mask in the \\"Real Action Hero\\" line. On the commentary track of Saw IV, several discussions occur about Jigsaw's decision to use references to pigs. In the series, the producers explained that Jigsaw was a spiritual person; however, it has never been revealed what religion he follows. In Saw IV, Jigsaw's ex-wife Jill explains Jigsaw's organized and planned lifestyle, stating that she had conceived their miscarried son Gideon, with Jigsaw planning for him to be born in the Year of the Pig. On the commentary track, the producers explain that in the Chinese zodiac, the Pig stands for fertility and rebirth. Jigsaw is seen several times throughout the series with figurines of clay soldiers and buddhas, further symbolizing his reverence to various Asian cultures. Jigsaw puzzle pieces Cut-outs were made, in the shape of jigsaw puzzle pieces, from the flesh of John Kramer's deceased victims who failed to pass their test. John received the nickname \\"Jigsaw\\" from the police and the press stemming from his tendency to perform such a ritual; however, he never encouraged that name and didn't actually like to be called \\"Jigsaw\\". Huntley argued that the jigsaw pieces that John cut out of the flesh of his failed test subjects was not intended as a mere stylized signature, but rather that it had a much deeper philosophical reflection. He stated that: > \\"Far from being a stamp of final approval, a post-(mortem)-script to the > game, the jigsaw piece represents the admission of the subject's missing > survival instinct, the corporeal body's non-relational or 'snagged' desire. > Those marked with jigsaw pieces are the ones that got away, left inert, > reduced to the zero intensity of death. It would seem strange that Jigsaw ‚Äì > surely the last figure ever to be deemed sentimental ‚Äì should choose to > extract this symbolic jigsaw piece from these subjects, except that Jigsaw > is linguistically consistent in explaining how he 'takes' or 'cuts' the > piece of skin. The jigsaw shape marking those who 'fail' is the adding of a > subtraction ‚Äì in effect, the removal of their inability, their unfulfilled > potential or their lack ‚Äì the excision that leaves the whole of the body > that is not the closed, inert corporeal body but is, instead, the 'body- > without-organs', that is, the nexus point where energy pools amid the flow > and fold of forces and durations, existence beyond the living organism.\\" A hand-drawn jigsaw puzzle piece was also present on the back of a photograph in Saw as part of a clue for one of his games. Apprentices Throughout the Saw series, John developed a tendency to recruit \\"apprentices\\" to carry on his perceived mission. Amanda Young, Detective Mark Hoffman, and two masked men named Pighead (Saw: The Video Game) and Pighead II (Saw II: Flesh & Blood) are the only known Jigsaw apprentices. Dr. Lawrence Gordon, Dr. Logan Nelson, and Jill Tuck are also assistants in certain games. Huntley analyzed Jigsaw's intentions in taking in prot√©g√©s as stemming from the terminally ill character's desire to overcome death itself, and argues that this is further evidence of his thought process being characterized by Deleuzian philosophy. Huntley argued: > \\"Jigsaw decides that the answer is to achieve immortality through a legacy, > having a successor to continue with his work. The impulse is Deleuzian. > Jigsaw remains calm, neutral and impassive throughout the Saw films (not > least because of his terminal condition) yet his only expressed wish, > concern or desire, is that his legacy is maintained ‚Äì the work of testing > the fabric of humanity should go on. \\"Jigsaw\\" ‚Äì as the intensive site of > being, a locus of desire, the body-without-organs ‚Äì can survive the death of > the organism John Kramer... What seems to be consistent thematically through > the Saw films is that \\"Jigsaw\\" is a part for various players, an identity > composed of pieces...\\" John was also assisted by Obi Tate in the kidnapping of the victims of the nerve gas house, shortly before the events of Saw II, and Zep Hindle throughout the first film. Brad and Ryan worked for Gordon and acted as his muscle, recruited after their trap. They helped Gordon to abduct Hoffman and they chained him in the bathroom. Kevin Greutert, the editor of Saw, Saw II, Saw III, Saw IV, and Saw V, and the director of Saw VI and Saw 3D, stated that Amanda, in particular, is \\"such a peculiar aspect of the Jigsaw character\\", citing that John had developed genuine \\"tender feelings\\" for her.'Interview: Saw VI Filmmakers Kevin Greutert, Mark Burg, Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton'. Retrieved February 21, 2010. The term \\"apprentice\\" was used in the official plot synopses for Saw III and Saw IV. His apprentices and helpers include: Detective Mark Hoffman: A police officer and a detective, he was recruited by John after he found out that Hoffman killed a man in a trap to make it look like a Jigsaw murder, because the man killed Hoffman's sister. Jigsaw abducted him, scolded him for killing him (since Hoffman created the trap to be unbeatable) since he himself despises murder, and made him his first apprentice by blackmailing him, but he eventually grew with the character and became loyal to John. He is considered to be his main accomplice and even an equal partner of sorts, and was Amanda Young's rival; both fought for John's approval, which is why Hoffman blackmailed her into failing her test to lose John's approval or risk his anger. He became John's successor after Amanda and John's death, but he was tested as well by John, when Jill Tuck (John's wife) subdued him, placed a Reverse Bear Trap on his head and then left, leaving him to die (fulfilling John's promise that Hoffman will not walk away untested). He survived it and he had his revenge while setting up new games, but he was eventually abducted by Dr. Lawrence Gordon, another of John's accomplices, and locked away in a bathroom to die. He was John's first apprentice. Hoffman is considered to be his most powerful associate, utilizing his police contacts and power as a detective to stray away the police from John's location, while keeping his identity secret (until he was exposed to Internal Affairs by Jill Tuck). However, Hoffman never personally chose any of his victims in his own traps, save for Seth Baxter, and posthumously left notes on future victims. Like John, Hoffman is a skilled engineer and programmer, designing the Pendulum Trap and operating it by himself, and also designing and setting several traps for Amanda (as she is too slender to properly carry and place victims in some traps, and lacks mechanical aptitude like John or Hoffman). However, his sadistic streak worried John, who was eventually convinced that Hoffman, after his death, would continue his work not out of true beliefs but rather in a sadistic power play of his own, and as such, planned for him to be tested, but Jill set up the Reverse Bear Trap on him to be inescapable. Amanda Young: A drug addict, she was abducted and placed in a Reverse Bear Trap by John. She managed to free herself from her trap. John recruited her after and was 'put in the House trap' in Saw II to make sure the victims played by the rules. However, she had become disillusioned with John's philosophy of giving the victims a chance; she created traps that couldn't be solved and deliberately made her victims die. John knew this and made a secret test for her to ensure that Dr. Lynn Denlon, a nurse from the hospital kidnapped to keep John alive, will be protected during the time and to free her after her task. However, she was unable to do so and she shot her. However, this was also a scheme by Hoffman; he blackmailed her into killing Lynn otherwise he would tell him that she was responsible for Jill's miscarriage; she was the one who sent Cecil to steal the drugs. She was shot by Jeff, Lynn's husband, and she bled to death. She was John's second apprentice. Amanda, unlike Hoffman, has a much deeper bond with John and considers him to be a second father and a mentor to her. She was almost slavishly devoted to him, abandoning her former life to fully focus on him and keeping him alive (at some point it was very loosely implied that she was also sexually attracted to him). Also unlike Hoffman, who uses the traps as his own form of sadistic, perverse justice that is justified in his mind, Amanda truly believes in John's work. However, by Saw III, she was disillusioned with his MO, and started to design traps to be inescapable, believing that her victims do not deserve the second chance in life. She also envied John's relationship with Hoffman, whom he considered to be a better- suited apprentice and successor, as Amanda was emotionally unstable and not mechanically adept to design traps as Hoffman. She is also deeply ashamed by the fact that she was the reason why John lost his child, as she sent Cecil to steal drugs, and tried to hide it from him. However, Hoffman, who was aware of it, blackmailed her into killing Lynn Denlon, John's latest victim, in order for Hoffman to prove to John that she was incapable of carrying John's legacy as Jigsaw. Dr. Lawrence Gordon: His secret helper, though not an official \\"apprentice\\". He was nursed back to health by John after surviving his trap and given a prosthetic foot, and became his new, secret accomplice. After he sawed off his own foot to escape, his fate was left unknown, although he was referred to in passing and seen in flashbacks throughout the following five movies. He did not appear in-person again until Saw 3D, using his prosthesis and a cane to walk. Following John's death, Jill delivered a videotape to Lawrence, in which John asked him to watch over Jill and take action if any harm came to her. After Hoffman killed Jill, Lawrence and two accomplices abducted him and chained him to the pipes in the bathroom. Lawrence then threw away the hacksaw he had used to free himself and left Hoffman to die. Lawrence, who was initially very wary of Jigsaw and his methods before he was abducted, came to sympathize with John after his abduction and after John saved his life. He developed a rather different, colder personality, causing his wife to divorce him. He remained a doctor, but secretly assisted John in his games. His identity and his existence was kept secret to Hoffman and Amanda in order to protect him from possible retributions from them, but Jill was kept aware of him in order to deliver John's will to him after his death. While he was mostly a silent protector for Jill and kept an eye on Hoffman and Amanda, he also directly participated in setting up traps that required medical expertise, such as implanting a key behind Michael's eye (Saw II) and sewing Trevor's eyes and Art's mouth shut for the Mausoleum Trap (Saw IV). He also wrote the \\"I KNOW WHO YOU ARE\\" note that Hoffman found on his desk after being promoted in Saw V. Jill Tuck: The wife of John, Jill was not an official \\"apprentice\\" either, but was tasked with carrying out a trap on Hoffman for John. After his death, John left Jill six envelopes, the first five of which contained a game for William Easton, while the sixth was for Hoffman, whom John intended for Jill to test. Another envelope in the box was addressed to Lawrence, who Jill personally delivered it to. Jill finally tests Hoffman and places the reverse bear trap on his head. Jill leaves him inside with no key, intending for it to kill him. However, Hoffman manages to escape and gets his revenge on Jill by placing her in the original Reverse Bear Trap and having it go off, claiming Jill as its first victim. Logan Nelson: John's first secret helper, though not an official \\"apprentice\\". Logan served in the Iraq War with the United States armed forces, where he was kidnapped and tortured by the enemy. Some time afterward, his wife Christine was murdered by Edgar Munsen, a criminal allowed to walk free by the corrupt Detective Halloran. While working at a hospital, Logan was responsible for mislabeling John's x-rays, which resulted in his cancer not being diagnosed until it had become terminal. Logan was kidnapped alongside four others in a barn by John, but did not regain consciousness during the first game until he had no time to save himself. John, deciding that Logan did not deserve to die for making an honest mistake, intervened and saved him. Theatrical robe John Kramer is usually seen wearing a black theatrical robe with a large hood and red lining when running traps or abducting victims. On the commentary track for the first Saw film, it was explained that the producers originally wanted Jigsaw to have the red robe with black interior. Thinking that the red robe was too vibrant for the film, they reversed the robe to make it black with red interior.Saw: Audio Commentary Amanda wore a similar robe in Saw III in an attempt to symbolically emulate her mentor. Although Hoffman, while wearing the pig mask, always wore the dark blue rain parka he'd worn since the murder of Seth Baxter, further illustrating the gap between him and John. Also, both Pighead and Pighead II wear similar robes to John, the only difference being that the Pighead robe is red. Reception A review of Saw II in the San Francisco Chronicle praised Tobin Bell and John as being \\"more terrifying than the movie villains in Hollywood's last five horror films put together; even though he's in a wheelchair and hooked up to multiple IVs.\\" Don Summer, a writer for Best- Horror-Movies.com, stated that \\"the villain, in Jigsaw, is brilliant and formidable\\" and that actor Tobin Bell has done a \\"fantastic job\\" for his role. Neil Smith, a film reviewer for the BBC, described Bell's Jigsaw as \\"creepy\\", describing the character as adding \\"a palpably sinister charge\\" to the scenes he appeared in. Sorcha N√≠ Fhlainn, a reviewer for the Irish Journal of Gothic and Horror Studies, remarked that Tobin Bell's Jigsaw had become such an entrenched staple of the Saw franchise, that the character's reduced appearance in Saw V was drastically felt. N√≠ Fhlainn also commented that Jigsaw's unique character was not successfully compensated for by his apparent successor in Saw V, Mark Hoffman. N√≠ Fhlainn went to the extent to remark that the character of Jigsaw is so central to the Saw franchise, that it should have ended as a trilogy considering Jigsaw's death at the end of Saw III. Similarly, several critics who reviewed Saw 3D lamented Bell's minimal screentime in the film,. Retrieved August 7, 2011..

Of Puerto Rican and Ecuadorian ancestry,Biography from www.emanuelxavier.com he emerged from the ball culture scene and Nuyorican spoken word movement to become a successful writer and advocate for gay youth programs and Latinx gay literature.Morales-D√≠az, Enrique. \\"Identity of the 'Diasporican' Homosexual in the Literary Periphery.\\" In Jos√© L. Torres-Padilla and Carmen Hayd√©e Rivera, eds. Writing Off the Hyphen: New Perspectives on the Literature of the Puerto Rican Diaspora. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2008. 295-312. Once an underage hustler and club kid drug dealer, and later a hate crime survivor, he has performed, conducted spoken word poetry workshops and produced benefits and events for LGBTQ youth organizations around the United States. Early years Born in Brooklyn, New York to an Ecuadorian mother, Xavier's father abandoned them after finding out she was pregnant. As a child, Xavier was the victim of child sexual abuse by a relative. At age 16, he came out to his mother and stepfather and was kicked out for being gay. He survived the streets as an underage hustler at the Christopher Street West Side Highway piers and became involved with the House of Xtravaganza and the 80's ball scene. After returning home under strict new rules, he graduated Grover Cleveland High School (Queens) and then attended St. John's University (New York City) for several years, dropping out after receiving his associate's degree in communications. He moved to the West Village and became a club kid making a living by selling designer drugs at popular New York City gay nightclubs, including The Sound Factory and Roxy NYC. Emanuel Xavier later worked at the now defunct LGBTQ bookstore A Different Light where he discovered his passion for writing and managed to turn his life around. He has said that he viewed poetry as an \\"outlet to unleash pain and anger.\\" Regarding his past, he stated, \\"I became all those things society expected me to become. I thought that was the only thing I could be.\\" Emanuel Xavier at the Christopher Street West Side Highway piers, NYC (1997) Professional career After surviving the streets of New York City as an underage hustler and later the gay club scene as a club kid drug dealer, Xavier discovered a love for spoken word poetry after attending an event at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe. As perhaps the first openly gay Nuyorican poet, he self-published a poetry chapbook, Pier Queen, in the fall of 1997. Emanuel Xavier (circa 2004) With the help of his friend, Willi Ninja, in 1998 he created the House of Xavier and the Glam Slam, an annual poetry slam competition featuring four open categories such as Best Erotic Poem in Sexy Underwear or Lingerie, Best Verbal Vogue and Best Love Poem in Fire Engine Red (alternately Best Bitter Break Up Poem in Blue). Winners of each category received a trophy and went on to compete for the Grand Prize title of Glam Slam Champion. The annual competition, a fusion of the House/ball community and the spoken word poetry scene, was first held in New York City and then London until 2010. The House of Xavier and House of Xtravaganza would collaborate to stage other more traditional ball events. Painted Leaf Press, a small, independent publishing company which went out of business, published Xavier's semi-autobiographical cult novel, Christ Like, in 1999. Despite a limited press run, the novel was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award in the Small Press category. It was later reprinted in 2009 by Rebel Satori Press as a revised ten-year-anniversary edition and in 2019 for the twentieth anniversary. In 2000, Xavier hosted the Lambda Literary Awards ceremony in New York. Soon after 9/11, Xavier was one of the leading forces behind Words to Comfort, a poetry benefit held at the New School. Written days after 9/11 at Ground Zero, his poem, \\"September Song\\", was originally included as part of the initial National September 11 Memorial & Museum website and later appeared in his follow-up 2002 poetry collection, Americano. He was featured on television on Russell Simmons Presents Def Poetry on HBO (Seasons 3 & 5) and In The Life on PBS. He also appeared in the Wolfgang Busch documentary How Do I Look and co-starred in the feature film The Ski Trip which aired on LOGO. Xavier edited the anthology Bullets & Butterflies: Queer Spoken Word Poetry in 2005, earning him a second Lambda Literary Award nomination in the Anthologies category. A few years later, in 2008, he edited the anthology Mariposas: A Modern Anthology of Queer Latino Poetry, at the time, considered a ground-breaking collection of gay Latinx spoken word poetry. In 2010, El Museo del Barrio and choreographer Fredi Xtravaganza staged a dance retrospective of Emanuel Xavier's spoken word poetry set to music featuring LGBTQ contemporary dancers. That same year, he published his third poetry collection, If Jesus Were Gay and released a spoken word poetry album, Legendary. The title spoken word poem, a tribute to the ball scene, was remixed into a House track and a video featuring the author and some of the dancers from the choreographed retrospective was shared on social media. A year later, El Museo del Barrio published Me No Habla Con Acento: Contemporary Latino Poetry, an anthology edited by Emanuel Xavier based on a successful monthly series he hosted at the museum featuring contemporary Latinx spoken word poets. Still of Emanuel Xavier from the video for \\"Legendary\\" He published his poetry collection, Nefarious in 2013 and was selected as a featured speaker for TEDx Bushwick on March 21, 2015. He also filmed for a documentary from Spain which included poets from around the world (Iceland, Jordan, Palestine) and helped organize the first ever After Sunset: Poetry Walk at The High Line with The Academy of American Poets. A year later, he published his fifth poetry collection, Radiance. For the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Inn riots, Emanuel Xavier was part of the Saks Fifth Avenue Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative in 2019 who partnered to give back to the LGBTQ community. Other celebrities included Amanda Lepore, Dionne Warwick, Kate Bornstein, Lea DeLaria, Michael Musto, Michael Urie and Nico Tortorella. Soon after testing positive and surviving COVID-19, during the pandemic era of 2020, he appeared virtually as guest speaker during the first ever Brooklyn College Lavender Graduation. Emanuel Xavier (2020) Regarding his unique career, he has been quoted to say, \\"I think at the beginning it was about me, about sharing my story. But as it evolved, it became more about the larger picture, hoping to inspire others not to follow that path, that it wasn't the only way to go if you were gay, a person of color, and thrown out because you were gay. That it wasn't the only option.\\" He works for Penguin Random House and founded The Penguin Random House LGBTQ Network where he originally served as Chair of the group. In a 2020 podcast for the Ali Forney Center, he announced that Emanuel Xavier Selected Poems would be published in April 2021. Activism As an activist, he has been invited to share his poetry at protests and rallies in support of LGBTQ rights. At one of several presentations at Towson University as a spoken word poet, his appearance was protested and targeted by a white supremacist hate group known as Youth for Western Civilization. At a high school presentation in Broward County, Florida, he was threatened with arrest before taking the stage if he did not agree to edit his poetry selections to be less political and explicit. He went on to publicly announce the arrest threat to his audience and shared how to find his full unedited selections online. He actively fought for marriage equality, appearing as a guest speaker for several protests including the NYC Fight The H8 Rally in 2009. One of his marriage equality protest appearances landed him as part of the opening credits for The Real Housewives of New York City. He would later get married himself in 2018 to his husband. PEN America invited him to read his signature poem \\"Americano\\" at the Writer's Resist rally on the steps of The New York Public Library in protest of the Trump administration in 2017. That same year, a week long exhibit was staged in NYC to celebrate the 20th anniversary of his poetry collection, Pier Queen. Having become a cult classic for LGBTQ People of Color, the twentieth anniversary edition of Pier Queen was officially published by Rebel Satori Press with photographs taken at the NYC West Side Highway piers by photographer Richard Renaldi. In 2018, he was invited back to share his poetry at The United Nations as part of The International Symposium on Cultural Diplomacy in the USA, after first having appeared in 2014. Instead of adhering to his set of selected poems, he used his platform to share a new poem about gun control in America. After criticism from gun rights activists, he was uninvited back as a speaker. Assault and aftermath In October 2005, Xavier was brutally attacked by a group of about twenty young men in the Bushwick area of Brooklyn. Despite various rumors about the attack‚Äîsome suggested it stemmed from his granting the Latin Kings gang permission to publish one of his poems, \\"Waiting For God\\", which dealt with police brutality while others simply brushed it off as another gay bashing‚Äîas a survivor, Emanuel Xavier would later write the poem \\"Sometimes We're Invisible\\", a tribute to some of his fellow Latinx queer and trans victims of violence. After the attack, Xavier was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma, a type of brain tumor, and had surgery; the tumor was benign, but resulted in a period of partial facial paralysis. He recovered from the paralysis; however, he became deaf in his right ear In Fall 2015, he announced on his personal website that the acoustic neuroma had returned. By year's end, he underwent successful radiosurgery. Awards and honors In 2010, The Equality Forum named him an LGBT History Month Icon. The American Library Association selected Xavier's poetry collections If Jesus Were Gay & other poems and Nefarious for their Over The Rainbow Books lists for 2011 and 2015 respectively.

It lies about 4 miles south-west of Wakefield, 3 miles south of Ossett, 1 mile south of Horbury. The village is in the Wakefield Rural ward of Wakefield Metropolitan District Council. The village name is shown on map \\"Dvcatvs Eboracensis pars occidentalis\\" from 1646. The h was dropped from nearby Shitlington and Sitlington was adopted in 1929 with the approval of the county council. History Netherton, originally Nether Shitlington was, with Over Shitlington (Overton) and Middle Shitlington (Middlestown), part of the township of Shitlington in the ancient ecclesiastical parish of Thornhill in the wapentake of Agbrigg and Morley in the West Riding of Yorkshire. A Mesolithic axe was found near the Star Inn in 1963. Shitlington was probably settled in Anglo-Saxon times and was recorded in the Domesday Book as Schellingtone. Netherton Hall, a Grade II* listed manor house, was built around 1775 for the Perkins family. St Andrew's Church was built in 1881 to the design of J. D. Sedding. Coal mining A mineral line connecting Sir John Lister Lister-Kaye's Caphouse Colliery to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Barnsley branch and coal staithes on the Calder and Hebble Navigation at Calder Grove passed through Netherton. It passed the hamlet of Little London on South Lane where the company owned the Victoria Pit. The Prince of Wales Pit, locally known as Wood Pit, was sunk near the line near New Hall Wood in 1870 and its shaft was deepened and widened in 1882. A second shaft was sunk 12 years later. A drift was driven in 1926 and another 30 years later. At nationalisation in 1947 the pit was named Denby Grange (Prince of Wales). It merged with Caphouse Colliery in 1981 and closed in August 1991. Its site is now occupied by Earnshaws who have operated a timber business in Midgley since 1860. Hartley Bank Colliery was sunk in 1872 on the south side of the Calder and Hebble Navigation and closed in 1968. A disaster in May 1924 when firedamp ignited killed five miners and injured 26 men. Geography The village is situated on the road from Horbury Bridge to Midgley, the B6117, on a hill above the valley of the River Calder. The underlying geology comprises the Coal Measures of the South Yorkshire Coalfield. Notable people The members of indie rock band The Cribs are originally from Netherton.

A base defense consists of two cornerbacks and two safeties, making the nickelback the fifth defensive back on the field, thus tying name of the position to the name of the North American 5-cent piece. Usually the nickelback will take the place of a linebacker, so if the team had been in a 4‚Äì3 formation, the four defensive linemen would remain, alongside only two linebackers and now-five defensive backs, creating a 4-2-5 formation. However, some teams will replace a lineman rather than a linebacker, creating a three linemen, three linebacker and five defensive back alignment, a 3‚Äì3‚Äì5 formation. If an offensive team always uses three or more wide receivers, a defense may turn to a nickel defense for their base package on most plays. Usually extra defensive backs, such as a nickelback, are substituted into the defense in situations where the opposing offense is likely to attempt a forward pass, such as 3rd-and-long, or when extra receivers are substituted into the opposing offense. The nickelback is the third cornerback or safety on the depth chart. The nickelback is not considered a starting position because the starting formation for a defense has only two cornerbacks and two safeties. Defensive formations with three or more cornerbacks (or three safeties) are used often enough that a nickelback will usually see moderate playing time (particularly in the modern, pass- oriented NFL) as well as subbing in for the starting corners. In certain packages (or if injuries depleted the depth chart), smaller free safeties or strong safeties can fill the spot of nickelback, as well. Their role may become that of a pass rusher from outside the box. In Canadian football, where five defensive backs are considered the norm, the position is known as a defensive halfback.

A coinciding graphic adventure video game was released for the original PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996 by Crystal Dynamics. The video game features the voice talents of several celebrities. The series' protagonists are anthropomorphic dragons who are beset by evil humans, reversing a common story convention. The series parodies that of the King Arthur Tales as well as the periods of the Middle Ages. From 1996 to 1998, Blazing Dragons was produced by Nelvana in Canada and Ellipse Programme in France. In the series, King Allfire and his Knights of the Square Table fight against the evil Count Geoffrey and his inept minions. It ran for two seasons consisting of 26 episodes in total. The cartoon episodes that ran in the United States, namely Toon Disney, were bowdlerised. Parts of episodes considered too overt, such as the implied homosexuality of an effeminate character named Sir Blaze, and minor swearing, were cut for the American release, as such matters were deemed taboo to American children's programming at the time. Characters Knights of the Square Table clockwise from upper left: Sir Galahot, Sir Loungelot, Sir Burnevere, Sir Blaze, King Allfire, and Sir Hotbreath Dragons * Squire Flicker: The main character of the series, a squire under Sir Loungelot, he happily accepts any task his master gives him. Flicker longs for the day he'll become a Dragon Knight himself, yet it seems the only reason he's not is that Loungelot typically takes credit for Flicker's heroic deeds. He is secretly in love with Princess Flame though he is very shy about showing it. Flicker is generally smarter and more competent than the Knights, and is a Machinist far ahead of his time even though his inventions do not always go well as he planned. In Season 2, he is also deemed as a fellow knight aside from being a squire. * Princess Flame: The daughter of King Allfire and stepsister of Blaze. Like Flicker, she also appears to be smarter and more competent than the Knights, though on a lesser scale. She is somewhat of a tomboy and will go through great lengths to save herself, the knights and/or the kingdom such as fighting in a tournament. She has a deep crush on Flicker. In season one, Flame was purple-haired (although often concealed by a veil), but in season two, she became a blonde. Her role seemed to diminish in season two. * King Allfire: King Allfire is the king of Camelhot, the head of the Knights of the Square Table, and married to Queen Griddle. King Allfire is also wielder of the legendary sword Excaliburn, but rarely uses it since he is semi-retired from fighting. * Queen Griddle: The second wife of King Allfire. She is the daughter of the gigantic Queen Mum, and is infatuated with Sir Loungelot. Griddle is also very short-tempered, and tends to get violent when angry. Due to her robustness, she is often the butt of many fat jokes. * Sir Loungelot: Head Knight of the Square Table, but as his name implies, is an incredibly lazy knight. Loungelot loves gambling, sleeping, and most of all food, especially pastries (such as biscuits, which he calls \\"bickies\\"). Loungelot rarely proves to be a useful companion in quests (though he is sometimes shown to be a good fighter) and often tries to get out of them except if it involves rescuing a damsel in distress or if threatened/forced by King Allfire. Despite these shortcomings, Loungelot is the favourite knight of the King and especially Queen Griddle. This is because he kisses up to her and invariably takes credit for Flicker's successes. The King and Queen, however, seem to be oblivious to Flicker's actions and often credit Lougelot for the work. Flicker is his squire, though he treats him more like a servant than a knight in training. Loungelot is the son of the Lady of the Lake (something he is not proud of since she nags him constantly and talks about his choir boy brother who is a monk). Loungelot is usually the cause of much of the knight's trouble due to his crass and selfish nature. His hair highly resembles that of Elvis Presley. * Sir Blaze: Sir Blaze, \\"The Smartly Dressed and Fashionably Late\\", is the flamboyant and effeminate son of Queen Griddle and the stepbrother of Princess Flame. Blaze is unusually energetic and is described as having amazing panache. Like Loungelot, he doesn't seem to be enthusiastic about participating in quests, preferring to work on \\"home\\" activities such as dressing the castle walls. He is one of the only three knights (the others Loungelot and Burnevere) who stays throughout the series. It is implied that he is homosexual. Unlike the other dragons in the series (with the exception of Flame), Blaze has long-limbered legs like a human rather than short stubby ones. in season 1, Sir Blaze's quote; \\"Oh me oh my oh oh gracious.\\" * Sir Burnevere: Sir Burnevere, \\"The Overly Educated\\", is a plucky hero with a Scottish accent and a tendency to use large words none of the other knights understand. Burnevere appears to be the oldest and wisest of the knights and often screams \\"Hoot McGregor!\\" when something bad happens to him. Burnevere is actually linked to the Scottish royal family, but turned down the throne at the thought of being surrounded by all his relatives. * Sir Galahot: Sir Galahot, \\"The Proper\\", is a large and imposing knight of the Square Table and the first knight to be introduced. He only appears in season one. * Sir Hotbreath: Sir Hotbreath, \\"The Not So Proper\\", is a short knight who has many ideas. Unfortunately, he often ends up torching everything near him due to uncontrollable outbursts of fire-breathing burps. Like Sir Galahot he only appears in season one. * The Wandering Minstrel: In season one, the Minstrel introduced and closed out most episodes with a short verse or song related to the content of the episode. While breaking the fourth wall in \\"Knights and Knightresses\\", Flicker remarks that he \\"thought he was just a background character who served as mere bridges between the scenes\\". In the second season, due to the shorter episode lengths, the Minstrel only appeared in the episode \\"Shamrocks and Shenanigans\\" as a secondary character, explaining that he was fired from Castle Camelhot. * Cinder and Clinker: A two-headed dragon jester. Cinder, the left-sided head, is upbeat and perpetually happy, whilst Clinker, the right-sided head, is always depressed and sullen. The duo serve as the comic relief in most episodes. Cinder's side of the body is a dark green, and Clinker's is a lighter shade. Cinder has light blue hair, and Clinker has brown hair. Humans * Count Geoffrey: The principal bad guy of the series, Geoffrey styles himself Dread Count Geoffrey de Bouillon, Oppressor Par Excellence of the Poor and Weak. His appearance changed from a purple knight's armour and red hair in season one to silver knight's armour with a dragon skull helmet and black hair in season two. His personality in the 2nd season also changes to be darker and more serious in tone to reflect his new appearance. Owner of Threadbare Castle, Geoffrey is always coming up with sinister \\"plans\\" to relieve the Dragon Knights of Castle Camelhot. * Evil Spy: An agent of Count Geoffrey dressed up in a purple dragon costume to infiltrate the Dragon Knights. His presence within the Dragon Knight ranks, usually while sensitive strategy is being discussed, never seems to be questioned by the other dragons, even though the costume is quite conspicuous. There are actually two within the show; The first is eaten by crocodiles in the second episode when Geoffrey pushes him into the moat, and is replaced with an identical evil spy. * Merle the Wizard: Merle the Wizard is a short, wise-cracking female magician who fits the stereotype of a witch much more than that of a wizard. She speaks with an American accent and often claims to have visited the future. When Count Geoffrey needs that extra edge in his fight against the Dragon Knights, Merle is often called upon and appears from a cloud of purple smoke. * Evil Knights No. 1, #2, and #3: The bumbling henchmen of Count Geoffrey. No. 1 is of medium height, fat, and has a bushy moustache. No. 2 is short and skinny with a long pointy nose, and speaks in an Italian accent. No. 3 is muscular, bald, and appears to be the stupidest of the three. It is possible the trio are brothers, since No. 3 mentioned his mother in the sense she was the mother of them all. * Peasants: Count Geoffrey is always exploiting the peasants of the village for either tax money or using them in some manner of slave labour such as catapult ammunition, or as human columns to hold up the ceiling of his crumbling castle.

Fan endeavours have differed in scale and scope, the \\"Brother Mine\\" series of novellas on wattpad being one notable example. Since July 2016, a new project called #BDRevolution or #BlazingDragonsRevolution appeared, consisting of making the fanbase grow through fanwork and converting new fans, bringing back old fans, convincing people who worked on the franchise (game and show) to support it, to convince Gavin Scott or Terry Jones to give the franchise a new chance, through any forms such as a new broadcasting, DVDs, a third season, a movie, a second game, or comic books, and so on. The project is slowly growing and was co- created by a fan and former story editor of season 2 Erika Strobel. Currently the entire series is available for purchase (for streaming only) at Amazon. No DVD set is known to be produced as of June 2019.

Counter-sniper tactics have evolved in sniper warfare to reduce the effectiveness of snipers. Reducing the risk of damage During the stalking phase of their attack, a sniper will, if time allows, try to identify high-value targets, such as senior officers or senior NCOs. They will do this by closely observing the behavior of the people in front of them. The intention is to identify who is in charge and then prepare to fire at them. It naturally follows that leaders should attempt to blend into the background by avoiding anything that distinguishes them from the most junior soldiers and attracts the interest of a sniper. In order to reduce a sniper's ability to damage the chain of command, doctrine and equipment need to prevent any observable \\"leadership\\" behaviors and signs. Insignia, e.g. rank insignia, should be subdued (dark/black as opposed to bright colors), camouflage colors on battledress, battledress identical for all ranks, military servants and rank-based luxuries (like saluting) avoided in forward areas, and commands and instruction should be given discreetly. Additionally, other acts such as looking at maps, using a radio, pointing authoritatively, abstaining from menial tasks and other forms of body language can betray an officer's rank. However, it is important to emphasize that if a sniper cannot identify an officer or NCO, they may then select any person that they have a good chance of hitting. Valuable assets should be parked in sand-bagged redoubts until they are launched, preventing \\"anti-materiel\\" attacks. This is a prudent tactic in any circumstance, as it prevents damage from fragments. Locating an attacking sniper Because snipers use camouflage, choose their firing positions carefully, and often attack from long distances, they are difficult to locate. Gunfire locators have been developed to do this. These may sense a variety of signatures including: * the shock wave from a supersonic bullet * the muzzle flash and sound * the heat of the bullet in flight * reflections from the telescopic sight When the trajectory of the bullet can be sensed, backtracking can be done to calculate the sniper's location. Sensor techniques are often used in combination to improve detection and eliminate false alarms. Sniper vs. sniper A friendly sniper is generally the most effective counter-sniper tool. With similar training, knowledge of the surroundings, and equipment, the friendly sniper can offer advice to the squad, enhanced searching capability, and combat the enemy sniper directly. When told what to watch for, the squad can also act as additional eyes and ears for the friendly sniper. Aside from watching over the squad, the friendly sniper also has the option to detach and engage the enemy sniper. Without any outside help from the squad, the respective skills of each sniper play a significant role in determining victory. Triangulation: technique at two or more locations can more accurately identify the position of a sniper at the time of firing. * Sound delay (\\"crack-bang\\"): The enemy's supersonic bullets produce a sonic boom, creating a \\"crack\\" sound as they pass by. If the enemy's bullet speed is known, their range can be estimated by measuring the delay between the bullet's passing and the sound of the rifle shot, then comparing it to a table of values. This is effective at distances of up to only 450 metres; beyond this, the delay continues to increase, but at a rate too small for humans to distinguish accurately. Also, in urban areas, the sound can give inaccurate results because the buildings in the area can relay false sound directions. * Detector: A 'sniper detector' system, named Boomerang, was developed through DARPA and can determine the bullet type, trajectory, and point of fire of unknown shooter locations. The system uses microphone sensors to detect both the muzzle blast and the sonic shock wave that emanate from a high-speed bullet. Sensors detect, classify, localize and display the results on a map immediately after the shot. The system sensors are usually mounted on a vehicle. The United States military is also funding a project known as RedOwl, which uses laser and acoustic sensors to determine the exact direction from which a sniper round has been fired. The RedOwl system has been tested on the PackBot robot from iRobot Corporation. Counter-attacking the sniper Once a sniper's position is known or suspected, other options follow: * Fire support: If the sniper's general position can be determined by other means, the area can be bombarded by mortars, artillery, or close air support. Rockets, guided missiles, anti-armor/anti-fortification weapons and other direct fire options may also be used by the forces in contact, as well. * Smoke screen: In urban settings or other environments with limited movement and fields of view, smoke can be an effective means to screen friendly movement. This can be used either to pass through and escape, or to close in on and eliminate the enemy sniper. Ordinary soldiers can still do damage through smoke by firing randomly or on intuition, but snipers lose their precision advantage and are far less likely to hit anything with their much lower possible shot volume. A determined enemy, such as an emplaced heavy machine gun, will fire randomly through smoke, so this is a dangerous tactic. Weapons of opportunity may also provide a smoke screen, anything from igniting a car's gas tank, oil drum, or using fragmentation grenades to throw up debris and quickly break line of sight and concentration. * Rush: Also known as \\"Close With And Destroy.\\" If the squad is pinned down by sniper fire and taking casualties, the order may be given to rush the sniper's position. If the sniper is too far away for a direct rush, a \\"rush to cover\\" can also be used. The squad may take casualties, but with many moving targets and a slow-firing rifle, the losses are usually small compared to holding position and being slowly picked off. * Pincer movement: If the sniper's position is known but direct retaliation is not possible, a pair of squads can move through concealment (preferably cover) and drive the sniper toward the group containing the targets. This decreases the chances that the sniper will find a stealthy, quick escape route. A pincer movement attack can be combined with artillery or mortar fire, so long as this is tightly coordinated, i.e. the target area covered by bombardment does not overlap with the movement of the counter-attacking troops. Even if bombardment does not kill or wound the sniper, it may flush them from cover. * Basic sniper identification method # The defenders monitor contact. As soon as contact is taken, the defenders try to make sure to take cover. If the defenders are on dismount, they try to make sure cover is the closest and most secure cover possible. If the defenders are mounted, they try to ensure all gunners reduce to \\"Chin strap defilade\\" where nothing is showing out of the vehicle but the chin and above. The defenders try to ensure the gunner has proper shielding. # The defenders scan the area to locate the sniper's position. # The defenders pop smoke to cover and conceal their position. # The defenders designate the element, close in with the element and destroy the enemy.

Their fanbase and their tours are currently limited to Slovenia, Germany and parts of Eastern Europe. Outside the region, the band is probably mostly known for the album \\"Vain, A Tribute To A Ghost\\" and their collaboration with Laibach on the album Volk in 2006. The music is characterized by melancholy, experimental sounds and vocal arrangements as well as meticulous production. The band is also known to incorporate various live instruments in their recordings, such as the piano, violin, viola, double bass, cello, valiha and other. The duo is recognized for their vast involvement in music writing for contemporary plays in Slovenian theater. Usually they will tour with the cast, or even be part of it, and perform the music live. \\"Musicians from the End of the World\\" (\\"Glasbenika s konca sveta\\"), directed by Haidy Kancler and produced by RTV Slovenia, is a 30-minute film which candidly documents the lives and two-decade long career of Silence. It also follows the band on their testing journey to producing their first studio album release in 8 years. \\"Musical Accompaniment for the End of the World (Songs for Two Pianos, Tactful Synths and Voice)\\" contains the 10 songs unveiled in the documentary and was scheduled to be released on April 14, 2012 ‚Äî the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the RMS Titanic. History=Getting started (1992‚Äì1998) Silence was founded in 1992 by Boris Benko, Matjaz Ferenc and Primo≈æ Hladnik. The band's first concert was held in Ljubljana two years later. In 1995, experienced producer Peter Penko (Laibach, Coptic Rain, April Nine, Siddharta) began a collaboration with the duo. Ferenc left the band the same year. Silence made their international debut in 1996 with the song \\"Shut Up\\", which was featured on the synthpop compilation \\"Daydream Collection\\" released on the German label \\"Gymnastic\\". The band signed a two-album contract with German label Chrom Records the same year. The Berlin independent label (located in Munich at the time of the contract signing) houses, among other artists, Deine Lakaien, Distain! and Helium Vola. Chrom Records released Silence's debut album \\"Ma Non Troppo\\" in 1997, an album that was declared Album of the month by the influential German magazine \\"New Life\\". The first single from the debut album was \\"Samuel's Gabriel\\", described by the band as \\"a cynical protest against the hypocrisy of the Clergy and Christianity as a political institution.\\" The video was shot in Munich and on the shores of Kenya in 1998. This was followed by a short German tour together with Distain!. Famous and internationally acclaimed producer Gregor Zemljiƒç (Random Logic) produced four songs for the upcoming follow-up album to \\"Ma Non Troppo\\" before the end of the busy year. Follow-up album (1999‚Äì2001) In 1999, Crom Records released Silence's second album, \\"Unlike A Virgin\\". The album was voted Album of the year in \\"Orkus\\", the popular German alternative music magazine. It received the highest grades in reviews by \\"Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung\\", \\"Ragazzi\\", \\"Online.de\\", \\"Wrath\\" and \\"Zillo\\" among others. A few months after the release of their second album, in March 2000, the band gave a sold out unplugged performance in Stih's hall, Cankarjev Dom, Ljubljana. Silence was accompanied by Blaz Medja (drums), Ales Berkopec (acoustic guitar) and the Rozmarinke string quartet. The concert was broadcast live on radio and is one of the band's most memorable performances to date. Crom Records released \\"Son Of Sin\\", the first single of \\"Unlike A Virgin\\". Meanwhile, the duo wrote the soundtrack for \\"Midnight Meat Flight\\", a performance by the notorious \\"Betontanc\\" dance theater, and Delo classified \\"Unlike A Virgin\\" one of the five most important Slovenian albums of the year. It was also nominated for best newcomer at the \\"Bumerang\\" alternative music awards. Benko provided vocals for the song \\"Cliffs Of Norway\\", written by Ernst Horn (Deine Lakaien) and featured on the compilation \\"Subout\\", released by Waldorf in 2000, together with De/Vision, Oomph!, Front 242, Front Line Assembly and Wolfsheim to name a few, many of which contributed with previously unreleased tracks. More theater (2001‚Äì2003) Silence started off 2001 by composing the music for \\"Peter Pan\\", a play jointly produced by \\"Lutkovno gledali≈°ƒçe Ljubljana\\" and \\"Slovensko Mladinsko gledali≈°ƒçe\\". Benko also sang live in \\"Svic & Svarc\\" (\\"Sweat & Soot\\"), a post-modern ballet piece interpreted by \\"Fico Balet\\" and directed by Goran Bogdanovski. In 2002, Silence wrote the soundtracks for \\"Maison Des Rendez-Vous\\", another Betontanc play, and \\"Viktorji\\", the biggest Slovenian media awards. The duo kept working with soundtrack projects and in 2003 they wrote two songs for \\"Emofad\\" (Emotivity Of Adventures), a contemporary dance performance directed and choreographed by Goran Bogdanovski. Benko and \\"Random Logic\\" also performed live during the dance performances. Nika Records released the \\"Maison Des Rendez-Vous\\" soundtrack in Slovenia. Later the same year, Silence recorded \\"Hall Of Mirrors\\" for \\"Trans Slovenia Express Vol. 2\\", a compilation of Kraftwerk covers recorded by Slovenian acts. The track featured Anne Clark as guest vocalist. A tribute to a ghost (2003‚Äì2005) A promotional photo of the duo circa 2004 The band worked with \\"Betontanc\\" again in 2004 and wrote the soundtrack for their tenth play, \\"Wrestling Dostoievsky\\". In addition to that, they wrote a soundtrack for \\"Winnie The Pooh\\", a puppet show by \\"Lutkovno gledalisce Ljubljana\\". Silence also produced several tracks for the female string quartet Rozmarinke. In November 2004, the third and most successful album to date, \\"Vain, A Tribute To A Ghost\\" was released by Matrix Music and Chrom Records, and the release was followed up by another sold out unplugged performance in Ljubljana. Silence would write one more soundtrack this year ‚Äì the soundtrack for \\"Lulabaj\\", a theatre play produced by \\"Slovensko Mladinsko gledalisce\\". \\"Vain, A Tribute To A Ghost\\" was listed as one of the three best releases of 2004 in Slovenia by Delo. Their first soundtrack of 2005 was for \\"Veronika decides...\\", a contemporary dance performance directed by Gagik Ismailian and produced by the Slovene National Theatre Opera and Ballet Ljubljana. An exclusive limited edition of the soundtrack, entitled \\"Veronika\\" was released when the show premiered. The band also toured with Diary Of Dreams in 2005, while Matrix Music released \\"Skin: The Remixes\\", featuring remixes by Umek, Valentino Kanzyani and Random Logic. The band worked with \\"Lutkovno gledalisce Ljubljana\\" again and wrote the soundtrack for the puppet show \\"Peter Rabbit\\". Key decisions (2005‚Äì2006) At the end of 2005 Silence was signed to Accession Records in Germany. Once again the duo held a sold out acoustic performance at Cankarjev Dom, before releasing Key under the new label. The release was a 2CD compilation of pivotal Silence tracks, nine of which previously unreleased. The first CD was an anthology, while the second one was more of a collector's item and featured rarities within a wide scope of genres. Critically praised \\"Tesla Electric Company\\", which opened July 19, 2006, marked Silence's first collaboration with influential director Toma≈æ Pandur and arguably the duo's most successful contribution to a play. The soundtrack featured a selection of older Silence material and a handful of tracks written specifically for the show. The duo performed the songs live, incarnating singing and piano-playing Teslas at given occasions. Tesla was portrayed by no less than seven different actors, including Rade ≈†erbed≈æija. The Laibach album \\"Volk\\", released in October 2006, is a collaboration between Laibach and Silence.  The Passion of the Cold (2007‚Äì2008) On 1 September 2008 Silence released their new album \\"The Passion of the Cold\\". On the same day the Bulgarian poet Svetoslav Todorov issued his debut poetry e-book \\"–Ü. Obezkostiavane\\" on his blog with \\"The True Nature of Happiness\\", one of the songs on the album, being included in the rar file. \\"The Passion of the Cold\\" is conceived as a handmade book containing two CD's, features 90 minutes of music from (or inspired by) Tomaz Pandur's plays Barroco and Kaligula.

H√§uptli, in Biografisch- Bibliografisches Kirchenlexikon:] s.v.\\"Simon von Cramaud\\" Simon was born before 1360 near Rochechouart, Haute-Vienne, a younger son in a family of minor nobles. He studied law at Orl√©ans and became a well-known canonist. Simon taught canon law at the University of Paris, attracting the attention of John, Duke of Berry, one of the uncles of King Charles VI of France. As a counselor of the duke, Simon performed both administrative and diplomatic tasks. In 1382, he was appointed Bishop of Agen, but was transferred to B√©ziers in 1383, and finally to Poitiers in 1385. He was also appointed to Sens in 1390, but never occupied the see -- instead he became the titular Latin Patriarch of Alexandria and Administrator of the Diocese of Avignon the following year. In 1409, he was made Archbishop of Reims and subsequently a cardinal in 1413. From then until his death, he served as the administrator of the Diocese of Poitiers. Cramaud was a prominent figure in the struggles of the fourteenth-century church, and a partisan of the Avignon Papacy. He championed Avignon Pope Clement VII, but fought Clement's successor, Benedict XIII, any way he could. He presided at the Council of Pisa in 1409, and proclaimed the deposition of both Gregory XII and Benedict XIII, thus securing the election of Alexander V. At the Council of Constance, he was largely responsible for the success of its election method, which granted a vote to certain national delegates along with the cardinals. He is considered by some\\"eine wichtige Etappe f√ºr die Ausformung des Gallikanismus,\\" according to Bruno W. H√§uptli, in Biografisch-Bibliografisches Kirchenlexikon. to be a precursor to both theological and political Gallicanism. Simon died on 19 January 1423. He was buried at the Poitiers Cathedral. His treatise ' (1397), offering multiple lines of reasoning for bringing the Schism to an end, was edited by Howard Kaminsky in 1984. Simon argued that Benedict's followers could withdraw obedience to compel him to seek a solution to the Schism.

Preparation  Aluminium nitrate cannot be synthesized by the reaction of aluminium with concentrated nitric acid, as the aluminium forms a passivation layer. Aluminium nitrate may instead be prepared by the reaction of nitric acid with aluminium(III) chloride. Nitrosyl chloride is produced as a by-product; it bubbles out of the solution as a gas. More conveniently, the salt can be made by reacting nitric acid with aluminium hydroxide. Aluminium nitrate may also be prepared a metathesis reaction between aluminium sulfate and a nitrate salt with a suitable cation such as barium, strontium, calcium, silver, or lead. e.g. Al2(SO4)3 \\\\+ 3 Ba(NO3)2 ‚Üí 2 Al(NO3)3 \\\\+ 3 BaSO4.  Uses  Aluminium nitrate is a strong oxidizing agent. It is used in tanning leather, antiperspirants, corrosion inhibitors, extraction of uranium, petroleum refining, and as a nitrating agent. The nonahydrate and other hydrated aluminium nitrates have many applications. These salts are used to produce alumina for preparation of insulating papers, in cathode ray tube heating elements, and on transformer core laminates. The hydrated salts are also used for the extraction of actinide elements.Pradyot Patnaik. Handbook of Inorganic Chemicals. McGraw-Hill, 2002, .

F. Al-Rawi (1952 - 2003) was a Medical Specialist/Physician, the president of Baghdad University, the chairman of the Iraqi Doctors Union, and the Ex-dean of College of Medicine University of Baghdad at the time of his death. Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Al-Rawi was reinstated as president of Baghdad University by US Deputy Proconsul Robin Raphel in May 2003 but he opted not to serve in this position while the country is under foreign control. Academic qualifications and career Al-Rawi was a professor at Baghdad University College of Medicine. He gained the UK MRCP degree in Medicine. He was a member of the Arab Board of Medicine and a member of the Iraqi Board of Medicine. Medical school and postgraduate years Al- Rawi entered Baghdad University College of Medicine in September 1971. Although he was already a full member in the Baath party, he kept a low political profile initially. It is said that he was following in the foot steps of his uncle, who helped him by promoting his Baath Party career. He worked closely with the Students Union (National Union of Iraqi Student, NUIS). He was known to be affable, outgoing and gregarious. Despite his political interests, he was dedicated academically and behaved like a model medical student who rarely missed a lecture. Although he was not the top of his class, he achieved a reasonably high marks on merits. After graduation with M.B.Ch.B. in 1977, he became a lecturer in Physiology in Baghdad University College of Medicine. Al-Rawi was soon sent to the UK to achieve the MRCP degree. With him, there were several other newly graduated doctors who mostly ended up returning to Iraq to raise the profile of their medical institutions. Circumstances of death Al-Rawi was killed in his clinic soon after the U.S. invasion. Reports from various secondary sources state that he was assassinated for his political views.

Similarly, the widely used logit method also has a counterpart ordered logit. Ordered probit, like ordered logit, is a particular method of ordinal regression. For example, in clinical research, the effect a drug may have on a patient may be modeled with ordered probit regression. Independent variables may include the use or non-use of the drug as well as control variables such as age and details from medical history such as whether the patient suffers from high blood pressure, heart disease, etc. The dependent variable would be ranked from the following list: complete cure, relieve symptoms, no effect, deteriorate condition, death. Another example application are Likert-type items commonly employed in survey research, where respondents rate their agreement on an ordered scale (e.g., \\"Strongly disagree\\" to \\"Strongly agree\\"). The ordered probit model provides an appropriate fit to these data, preserving the ordering of response options while making no assumptions of the interval distances between options. Conceptual underpinnings Suppose the underlying relationship to be characterized is :y^* = \\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\mathsf{T}} \\\\beta + \\\\epsilon, where y^* is the exact but unobserved dependent variable (perhaps the exact level of improvement by the patient); \\\\mathbf{x} is the vector of independent variables, and \\\\beta is the vector of regression coefficients which we wish to estimate. Further suppose that while we cannot observe y^*, we instead can only observe the categories of response: : y= \\\\begin{cases} 0~~ \\\\text{if}~~y^* \\\\le 0, \\\\ 1~~ \\\\text{if}~~0 Then the ordered probit technique will use the observations on y, which are a form of censored data on y^*, to fit the parameter vector \\\\beta. Estimation The model cannot be consistently estimated using ordinary least squares; it is usually estimated using maximum likelihood.

Voluntary compliance is seen as an alternative to the state- imposed regulations on a company's behavior. Proponents of voluntary compliance argue that it is in a company's own interest to behave in a socially responsible manner and that in pursuit of good public image, the company will refrain from actions which could damage its perception by the public. Thus there is no need for state regulations. On the other hand, opponents deem that companies may claim to voluntarily adhere to self-imposed regulations but in practice they often follow profit maximizing behavior, often violating stakeholders' interests. However, such behavior may be problematic not only morally or ethically but also legally: corporate codes of conduct may give rise to legal obligations pursuant to national laws of European Union member states implementing the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive or pursuant to consumer protection laws in other jurisdictions, including (subject to the effect of the Federal and State constitutions) the States of the United States of America. In the United States, voluntary compliance may also refer to an argument made by tax protesters who suggest that payment of income tax is voluntary, and not legally enforceable. However, this argument is rejected by the Internal Revenue Service, and has not been accepted by the U.S. courts.

Geography and hydrology Castlehill Reservoir in Glen Devon The source of the river is Blairdenon Hill in the Ochils at an altitude of . Upper areas have been dammed, creating Upper Glendevon, Lower Glendevon and Castlehill reservoirs. The Devon then flows east and southeast through Glendevon, turning southwest at Crook of Devon and then continuing westwards, meandering across its flood plain along the foot of the Ochil Hills. It reaches the River Forth to the west of Alloa at the small village of Cambus. The UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, (part of UK's Natural Environment Research Council, NERC) describes the catchment area thus: \\"Headwaters are steep; lower valley is broad and very flat. Bedrock extrusive igneous rocks, 50% overlain by superficial deposits. Land use arable in the valley; grassland in headwaters, some forest.\\" The catchment covers an area of 181 km2. Glen Devon 18th century Bridge at Glendevon Glen Devon stretches from the junction of the river Devon with the dramatic Glen Eagles (a perfect U-valley) southwards to the Yetts of Muckhart where the landscape then opens into a wide flood plain. The natural landscape was greatly altered by the construction of the Castlehill Reservoir which was built around 1975. The central village, Glendevon, lies north of the reservoir, and has for 70 years been a holiday destination for holiday cabins. Glen Devon Castle was largely destroyed by fire c.1970. Its arched entranceway still exists at the north end of the reservoir. The village contains the old coach hostelry, The Tormaukin, which still survives as a restaurant. The church and manse lie north of the main village. An 18th century bridge crosses the Devon to the south of the church. The high level reservoirs are named Glenquey, Glensherup, after the Devon's high level tributaries, and upper and lower Frandy reservoir. All were built by German PoWs in the Second World War and are used for trout fishing.https://www.scotland.org.uk/guide/places/glendevon-visitor-guide History and culture During the Scottish Reformation, William Kirkcaldy destroyed the bridge at Tullibody in attempt to prevent French troops retreating to the Siege of Leith at the end of January 1560. However, the French took down the roof of Tullibody Kirk to bridge the Devon.Knox, John, History of the Reformation, Book 3, e.g., Lennox, Cuthbert, ed., (1905), 191. The Devon was surveyed by James Watt in 1766, who claimed that by deepening the river bed it might be navigable as far as Dollar. The estimated cost of such a project was ¬£2000. Two songs The Banks of the Devon and Fairest Maid on Devon Banks were written in 1787 by Robert Burns, which recall Charlotte Hamilton of Mauchline whom he had met at nearby Harviestoun estate. The Devon Valley Railway was built along the strath.

Land became saturated and rainfall resulted in run-off into rivers, reaching the river system very quickly. River flows in the region were 'Exceptionally High'. Upstream, all the Ochil reservoirs were full with Castlehill reservoir overflowing for all of that month. The flood at the upstream gauge at Castlehill was the second highest recorded. Further downstream, the water level recorded at Glenochil was the highest since records began in 1956.

Biography Hellcat in 1976, but Ruth Atkinson was drawing Hellcats long before then. From Wings Comics #45 (Nov. 1944). Born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Ruth Atkinson as an infant moved with her family to upstate New York. One of the first female artists in American comic books, she entered the field doing work for the publisher Fiction House beginning either 1942 or 1943, and either on staff or, as noted by the Connecticut Historical Society, through the Iger Studio, a comic-book \\"packager\\" that produced comics for publishers on an outsource basis. Fellow female artists Fran Hopper, Lily Ren√©e, and Marcia Snyder also worked for Iger, where one of the business partners was a woman, Ruth Roche. Atkinson's first confirmed, signed work is the single-page \\"Wing Tips\\" featurette in Wings Comics #42 (Feb. 1944). Atkinson continued to pencil and ink that airplane-profile featurette, as well such Fiction House features as \\"Clipper Kirk\\" and \\"Suicide Smith\\" in Wings Comics, \\"Tabu\\" in Jungle Comics, and \\"Sea Devil\\" in Rangers Comics. At some point, she became the Fiction House art director, but left the position to freelance after finding that the managerial position left little time for her art. With writer Otto Binder, she went on to draw and co-create the feature \\"Patsy Walker\\", for Marvel Comics predecessor Timely Comics in Miss America Magazine #2 (Nov. 1944).Miss America Magazine #2 at the Grand Comics Database. She would draw that humor/romance feature for two years, as well write and draw the premiere issue of the long-running series Millie the Model. Atkinson later drew true-life adventures for Eastern Color Comics' Heroic Comics, as well for some of the first romance comics, including Lev Gleason Publications' Boy Meets Girl and Boy Loves Girl, through the early 1950s. Atkinson retired from comics sometime after her marriage. She was living in Pacifica, California, at the time of her death from cancer.

Let C_q(n,d) be the set of all q-ary codes with length n and minimum distance d and let C_q(n,d,w) denote the set of codes in C_q(n,d) such that every element has exactly w nonzero entries. Denote by C the number of elements in C. Then, we define A_q(n,d) to be the largest size of a code with length n and minimum distance d: : A_q(n,d) = \\\\max_{C \\\\in C_q(n,d)} C. Similarly, we define A_q(n,d,w) to be the largest size of a code in C_q(n,d,w): : A_q(n,d,w) = \\\\max_{C \\\\in C_q(n,d,w)} C. Theorem 1 (Johnson bound for A_q(n,d)): If d=2t+1, : A_q(n,d) \\\\leq \\\\frac{q^n}{\\\\sum_{i=0}^t {n \\\\choose i} (q-1)^i + \\\\frac{{n \\\\choose t+1} (q-1)^{t+1} - {d \\\\choose t} A_q(n,d,d)}{A_q(n,d,t+1)} }. If d=2t, : A_q(n,d) \\\\leq \\\\frac{q^n}{\\\\sum_{i=0}^t {n \\\\choose i} (q-1)^i + \\\\frac{{n \\\\choose t+1} (q-1)^{t+1} }{A_q(n,d,t+1)} }. Theorem 2 (Johnson bound for A_q(n,d,w)): (i) If d > 2w, : A_q(n,d,w) = 1. (ii) If d \\\\leq 2w, then define the variable e as follows. If d is even, then define e through the relation d=2e; if d is odd, define e through the relation d = 2e - 1. Let q^* = q - 1. Then, : A_q(n,d,w) \\\\leq \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n q^*}{w} \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{(n-1)q^*}{w-1} \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\cdots \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{(n-w+e)q^*}{e} \\\\right\\\\rfloor \\\\cdots \\\\right\\\\rfloor \\\\right\\\\rfloor \\\\right\\\\rfloor where \\\\lfloor ~~ \\\\rfloor is the floor function. Remark: Plugging the bound of Theorem 2 into the bound of Theorem 1 produces a numerical upper bound on A_q(n,d).

Alongside Narsarsuaq Airport, it is one of only two civilian airports in Greenland large enough to handle large airliners. It is located away from the coast and hence less prone to fog and wind in comparison with other airports in Greenland. Kangerlussuaq Airport is the international hub for Air Greenland. The Kangerlussuaq area has very few inhabitants (around 500), so few passengers have their origin or destination here; most passengers change planes. History The first airport was built here during the US occupation in 1941 under the name of Bluie West-8, later renamed Sondrestromfjord Air Base and Sondrestrom Air Base. In the mid 1950s, transatlantic civilian flights began using the air base for refueling. In 1956, Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) was flying \\"Polar route\\" service with three round trip flights per week being operated with Douglas DC-6B propliners on a routing of Copenhagen - Sondre Stromfjord (now Kangerlussuaq) - Winnipeg - Los Angeles.http://www.timetableimages.com, Jan.1, 1956 SAS system timetable This use enabled air travel to Greenland, but fell off in the 1960s as airliners gained greater range. Instead the base became the hub of Greenland air traffic. The airport was handed over to civilian Greenlandic control in 1992. Future At a late 2011 Air Greenland meeting, plans to move the main Greenland intercontinental air hub away from Kangerlussuaq were agreed upon. According to the 2011 plan, three airstrips will be built: a new airport at Qaqortoq, as well as extensions at Nuuk and Ilulissat. New airports will probably also be built at Tasiilaq and Ittoqqortoormiit later. Alongside Kangerlussuaq, the airports at Narsarsuaq and Kulusuk (if Tasiilaq is built) will also be closed. Generally, a number of the airstrips have been built by the US military at locations deliberately away from major settlements, partly due to the Danish policy to downplay the presence of the US military in Greenland. There is also a need to renovate the Kangerlussuaq runway for a fairly high cost as the permafrost is melting under it.Gr√∏nland vil udvide og nybygge fem lufthavne (Danish) A decision was made in 2016 to extend the runways of both Nuuk and Ilulissat airports to , allowing them to receive medium size jetliners from Denmark, and also to replace Narsarsuaq with a new airport at Qaqortoq. Construction at Nuuk is expected in late 2018. This, in combination with the condition of the runway, will probably mean that Kangerlussuaq will be eventually closed or used for smaller planes for flights to other cities in Greenland only, and for charter flights in connection with cruise ship arrivals. Even if Nuuk and Ilulissat will get direct flights from Europe, Kangerlussuaq will still be important, partly due more stable weather and longer runway. Cruise ships want to exchange passengers at Greenland because the long journey time to Greenland and back to home is unsuitable for many passengers. They need a reliable airport with few delays, because cruise ships have firm planned schedules with booked ports and land activities. For this reason, in 2018 plans were approved to build a better port near Kangerlussuaq together with a 15 km road to the airport. As of 2018, the small port can't take cruise ships nor large freight ships, so transfer boats are needed. Airlines and destinations=Passenger Access to several research camps on the Greenland ice sheet, including the Danish field camp North GRIP and the American Summit Camp, is handled through Kangerlussuaq via the 109th Airlift Wing of the New York Air National Guard. There are also a few tourist charter flights between Germany and Kangerlussuaq every summer, in connection with cruise ship arrivals to the Kangerlussuaq seaport. Those flights have typically been operated by Air Greenland or airlines from Germany. Other charter flights are used, for example a number of flights from the US and Canada landed in connection with the 2016 Arctic Winter Games in Nuuk. Freight Flights from Copenhagen using large aircraft is the main way of quick transport of mail and goods, including fresh food, to Greenland. Because of the lack of a good port at Kangerlussuaq, most of it is transported by air to other destinations. Goods that don't need such quick transport are often freighted by air to Nuuk and then by ship to other places in Greenland. A road to Sisimiut at the coast is planned with this freight in mind. In general, there are worries about cost, and furthermore the uncertainty of the future of Kangerlussuaq airport makes it hard to decide upon a road or a port. Facilities The terminal is open for 24 hours a day during summer. Hotel Kangerlussuaq, with 70 rooms and a restaurant, is located within the terminal building of the airport, providing accommodation for transferring passengers. Other amenities include a nightclub and a self-service bar open in the daytime. Several tourism outfitters share an office in the terminal, alongside the Tourist Office. There are two other more simple accommodations in Kangerlussuaq.

His public image was that of a free-spirited hippie artist. His books featured his photographs of nature and the male nude. When sales declined in the harder-edged culture of the 1980s, and Rinder found it difficult to get his books published, he supplemented his income by selling collectibles. In the 1990s Rinder's creativity diminished; he stated \\"my heart lies in the 60's and 70's\\". His work has been referred to by Reginald Shepherd in Orpheus in the Bronx as not \\"what could be called real poetry\\" along with verse of Rod McKuen. In a 2020 interview with an Australian podcaster, Rinder stated \\"I tried to write simple. I was trying to use simple words, not intellectual and all that. Because I wanted to reach the simplest of people and young people especially, because they have their whole life ahead of them. So I used simple words and I tried to do that to reach the young people who are starting out in life and building their future.

His father was Jewish; his mother an English-Dutch Protestant. He attended Alhambra High School and Mt. San Antonio Junior College in Pomona. From 1955 to 1957 he was in the U.S. Army. In 1959 he began working his way across the U.S. living out of a suitcase, working at jobs which included a bellhop, soap salesman, theater set builder, ranch hand, and landscape artist's aide. \\"I want more out of life than most people\\", he wrote.https://www.amazon.com/Spectrum-Love- Revisited-Walter-Rinder/dp/0971445109 In 1965 he first exhibited his photography in San Francisco, and in 1968 opened a photographic gallery in that city. In 1969 he published his first book of photographic postcards, and left San Francisco to live in the small town of Laytonville, California where he opened a small gallery located in his home. In 1970 relocated to Portland, Oregon, and published a book of poems Love is an Attitude. The same year he opened a gallery, This Speck of Earth in the city. In 1971 he published This Time Called Life: in 1973 it became a record album. Other books of poetry followed, including Spectrum of Love, The Humanness of You, Follow Your Heart, Only One Today, My Dearest Friend, Love Is My Reason. Will You Share With Me? and Where Will I Be Tomorrow?. Rinder's photographs appeared in the 1974 publication by James Vaughan titled Please Trust Me. In the late 1980's, Rinder returned to California to care for his aging mother, and eventually returned to Portland. In 1990 a selection of this works was published as The World I Used to Know. In 2001 Spectrum of Love Revisited was published. As his books were his source of income, the decline in interest in Rinder's poetry resulted in financial woes, and the turning to selling collectibles for income. In a post on his Facebook page he wrote: \\"I have dug into dumpsters, trash cans, river boat ramps, rest stops‚Ä¶ challenged by all weather‚Ä¶.one nickel at a time.\\"https://www.facebook.com/walter.rinder.1/posts/164338397095163 Rinder now cares for a handicapped friend and states that his dream is to purchase a mobile home for them both.

Trust in your feelings as they are the voices of your soul.\\" In 2020, Rinder was interviewed by an Australian podcaster, and spoke at length about his life as a poet.

The system was mobile and could be set up rapidly, allowing it to move to a new firing location after learning of an enemy missile launch. To attack the weapon, the enemy would have to blanket the area around its last known location with multiple warheads, using up a large percentage of their force for limited gains and no guarantee that all of the missiles would be destroyed. In such a scenario, the U.S. would retain enough of their forces for a successful counterstrike, thereby maintaining a deterrence. Overview The Midgetman grew out of a requirement expressed in the mid-1980s by the U.S. Air Force for a small ICBM which could be deployed on road vehicles. Fixed silos are inherently vulnerable to attack, and with the increasing accuracy of submarine-launched ballistic missiles there was a growing threat that the Soviet Union could launch large numbers of missiles from off the coast, destroying most of the U.S. ICBM force before it could be used (first strike). By producing a mobile missile which could not easily be targeted by enemy forces, and thus survive a first strike attempt, the Air Force hoped to reduce this possibility and maintain the ability to deter (second strike). It was also a response to the Soviet development of SS-24 (rail mobile) and the SS-25 (road mobile) ICBMs. System definition studies for the SICBM (Small Intercontinental Ballistic Missile) commenced in 1984 under an Air Force Program Office, located at Norton AFB, CA, with TRW providing System Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) support. Contracts were awarded by the end of 1986 to Martin Marietta, Thiokol, Hercules, Aerojet, Boeing, General Electric, Rockwell and Logicon and authorization to proceed with full scale development of the MGM-134A Midgetman was granted. The first prototype missile was launched in 1989, but tumbled off course and was destroyed over the Pacific Ocean after about 70 seconds. The first successful test flight took place on April 18, 1991. Design In design the XMGM-134A was a three-stage solid-fuelled missile. Like the LGM-118 Peacekeeper it used the cold launch system, in which gas pressure was used to eject the missile from the launch canister. The rocket would only ignite once the missile was free of the launcher. The Midgetman had a range of some . Two warheads were developed for the missile: the W87-1 warhead in a Mark 21 re-entry vehicle with a yield of , and the W61 earth penetrating warhead with a yield of .. Carrier vehicle: Hard Mobile Launcher Hard Mobile Launcher The Midgetman was to be carried by an eight-wheel drive Hard Mobile Launcher (HML) vehicle. Most of these vehicles would normally remain on bases, only being deployed in times of international crisis when nuclear war was considered more likely. The Hard Mobile Launcher was radiation hardened and had a trailer mounted plow to dig the HML into the earth for additional nuclear blast protection.https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/icbm/us_hml_01.jpg Cancellation With the end of the cold war in the 1990s the U.S. scaled back its development of new nuclear weapons. The Midgetman program was therefore cancelled in January 1992. The legacy of its lighter graphite-wound solid rocket motor technology lived on in the GEM side boosters used on the Delta rockets, and the Orion stages of the Pegasus air-launched rocket. The Soviet equivalent of this missile was the RSS-40 Kuryer which was tested but cancelled in October 1991. This could have filled the role of the more cost effective Topol M road mobile ICBM.

Opened in 1941, the hospital is licensed for 483 beds, and has over 3,000 employees. There are approximately 1,000 physicians on staff. The campus is also home to Providence Child Center, a 58-bed facility dedicated exclusively to medically fragile children. Providence Portland Medical Center is part of the Providence Health & Services in Oregon. Providence Portland Medical Center is one of four nursing magnet hospitals in Oregon, the others being Providence St. Vincent Medical Center, Veterans Affairs hospital, and OHSU Hospital in Portland. History The Catholic Sisters of Providence order was asked to expand their healthcare offerings on the east side of Portland in 1937. At that time, Archbishop Edward D. Howard requested that the order construct a hospital, originally to be named St. Vincent Hospital East, in reference to the existing St. Vincent Hospital (now Providence St. Vincent Medical Center), which at that time was located in Northwest Portland. The next year the Sisters' plans to build a hospital in the Laurelhurst area were approved and they began buying property at Northeast 47th and Glisan. Providence Hospital opened in September 1941. A new cancer tower was constructed in the late 2000s, which added 150 new inpatient beds. The 11 story tower houses cancer, surgery, and state-of-the- art patient care facilities. In 2011, the last nuns housed at a convent located within the main building left the facility. Details The hospital has 483 licensed beds (397 are staffed), and in 2012 had 21,351 admissions and 63,299 emergency department visits. It has 3,160 employees, of which 1,200 are physicians.

It broadcasts on 1600 kHz on the AM radio dial with an ethnic format. It is owned by Herbert Hoffman. History The station first signed on in 1948 as WVOM, a local station. WVOM was one of the earliest stations in the Boston area to adopt 24-hour broadcasting on a regular basis. The station was sold to Herbert Hoffman in 1955, who changed the call letters to WBOS and eventually added an FM station, WBOS-FM. The AM station had some leased-time ethnic programming, but also for a time in the mid 1950s was home to one of the first rock-and-roll shows on Boston radio, hosted by a young Arnie \\"Woo-Woo\\" Ginsburg. In the late 1950s, WBOS was mostly a beautiful music simulcast on both AM and FM, although some ethnic programming remained on the AM side. In the late 1960s, WBOS gradually abandoned simulcasting with WBOS-FM and increased the amount of ethnic programming on the AM side. The call letters of the AM station became WUNR in 1969 to reflect its ethnic format. WUNR's transmitter and antenna are located in nearby Newton, Massachusetts. A few years back, the transmitter site was rebuilt, which resulted in a more powerful (20,000 watts) signal for the station in most of the Boston area, but still heavily \\"nulled\\" to the southwest to protect WWRL in New York City.

Completed in 2006, it is named after its developers, the Beetham Organisation, and was designed by SimpsonHaugh and Partners. The development occupies a sliver of land at the top of Deansgate, hence its elongated plan, and was proposed in July 2003, with construction beginning a year later. At a height of , it was described by the Financial Times as \\"the UK's first proper skyscraper outside London\\". From 2006 to 2018, the skyscraper was the tallest building in Manchester and outside London in the United Kingdom. In November 2018, it was surpassed by the newly topped out South Tower at Deansgate Square, which is tall. As a result of the elongated floor plan, the structure is one of the thinnest skyscrapers in the world with a height to width ratio of 10:1 on the east‚Äìwest fa√ßade, but is noticeably wider on the north‚Äìsouth fa√ßade. A four-metre cantilever marks the transition between hotel and residential use on the north fa√ßade, and a blade structure on the south side of the building acts as a fa√ßade overrun accentuating its slim form and doubles as a lightning rod. The skyscraper is visible from ten English counties on a clear day. The top floor penthouse offers views of Greater Manchester, the Cheshire Plain, the Pennines and Snowdonia. The tower is known for emitting a loud unintentional hum or howl in windy weather, believed to emanate from the glass 'blade' atop the building. The hum has been recorded as a B below middle C and can be heard over large parts of the local area. Architectural response to the skyscraper is polarised and interpretations vary. Some questioned its dominant appearance over the city, particularly over listed buildings, with one author going as far to say the skyscraper instantly \\"torpedoed\\" any possibility of Manchester becoming a UNESCO World Heritage City ‚Äì a status Manchester was previously on the United Kingdom shortlist for due its industrial past. Others feel its dramatic appearance and peculiarity is reflective of Manchester, and that the Beetham Tower symbolises Manchester's reinvention as a post-industrial city, particularly since the bombing of 1996. Nevertheless, it has received praise and was awarded the best tall building in the world in 2007 by the Council for Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. In 2019, it was the subject of a legal dispute over the need for urgent repair works to parts of the glass panel fa√ßade. History Beetham Tower under construction. The site was next to a redundant section of railway viaduct. With the support of English Heritage and the recommendation of the planning department, the Beetham Organisation submitted a planning application to Manchester City Council in July 2003. Planning permission was granted in October 2003. The skyscraper was part of Manchester's regeneration, and by the end of 2003, before construction had started, 206 of its 219 flats, and 4 of its 16 penthouses had been pre sold. The skyscraper was built when much of the United Kingdom was experiencing an economic boom and high rise towers were being built in many English cities. Ground and foundation works commenced at the beginning of 2004, and construction started in April 2004. By August 2004, work on its twin concrete cores had started and the structure was rising at a steady rate. One of the cores reached at the end of July 2005, at which point the building became the tallest skyscraper in the United Kingdom outside London. The tower was \\"topped out\\" on 26 April 2006. Local wind conditions dictated its height had to be reduced by about from the planned . The hotel opened on 9 October 2006, and the first apartment residents moved in during 2007. The skyscraper cost ¬£150 million to construct. Architecture width to height ratio of 1:10. 259x259px The building stands on a narrow site on Deansgate at the junction with Great Bridgewater Street and Liverpool Road. Its tall rectangular form maximises the available space. On the 23rd storey a cantilever projects by 13 feet (4 metres), increasing its floor space and giving the tower definition. On the roof is a glass overrun, described as a \\"glass blade\\" by the architect. The ten-metre blade accentuates the flat south fa√ßade, contrasting with the north fa√ßade, and doubles as a lightning rod. The tower was built by Carillion using post-tensioned flat slab concrete construction techniques and was the first structure in the United Kingdom to use the Doka SKE 100 automatic climbing system and trapezoidal windshield. Piling foundations are typically preferred for skyscrapers; however, Manchester's sandstone substrata meant a raft foundation. The 2.5-metre thick raft foundation sits nine metres below the ground level. Approximately 57,000 tonnes of concrete and 6,000 glass panes for the curtain-wall structure were required. Over 8,000m2 of rigid insulation board by Kingspan was used to reduce heat loss. Beetham Tower's south facade seen from Bridgewater Viaduct. The curtain-wall structure is clad in glass, and elements were added to counter excessive light. Louvres on south-facing windows allow for the control of daylight and sunlight into its interior. On the west- and east-facing sides, aluminium strips which are noticeable from ground level project outwards to provide shading from the sun. The louvres on the south fa√ßade alter its consistency and appearance when some are open and others are closed. They stop excessive passive solar gain. Ultraviolet light hits the glass and is changed to infrared which generates heat through radiation, creating overheating. The tower has 47 floors and is 168.87 metres (554 ft) in height, making it the tallest building in the United Kingdom outside London, and the tallest building in Manchester, until it was surpassed by Deansgate Square. Floors 1 to 22 are occupied by the 279-bedroom four-star Hilton Manchester Deansgate Hotel. The 23rd floor has a four-metre cantilevered overhang with two glass windows in its floor, overlooking the ground from the skybar, Cloud 23. The floor has a bar and lounge operated by Hilton. Floors 25 to 47 are occupied by residential apartments. A twelve- storey office block is planned next to the tower, with 6,506 square metres of floor space. The hotel has a four-storey annexe, containing a swimming pool, ballroom, conference rooms and coffee shop. Occupancy The architect, Ian Simpson, lived in the top floor penthouse, the highest residential space in Europe after surpassing Lauderdale Tower at the Barbican Estate in London upon opening in 2006. It cost ¬£3 million and occupies the top two storeys. It has a semi indoor garden containing 21 four metre tall olive, lemon and oak trees, originating from Italy and lifted into place with cranes through a small aperture in the roof before it was glazed in 2006. The Hilton Manchester Deansgate occupies space up to Level 22, and a four-metre cantilever marks level 23 where the Cloud 23 bar is located. Above this level are apartments from level 25 to the triplex penthouse apartment on level 47. Beetham claimed 90% of the residences were sold before construction began in 2004. The Daily Telegraph claimed that 55 of 219 apartments were waiting to be let, and a further thirty were unsold in September 2008. In September 2010, the Manchester rental market had improved, and only two apartments out of 219 were unoccupied awaiting interior fit-out. Prices for an apartment ranged from ¬£200,000 to ¬£750,000 in 2011. In 2012 demand for apartments exceeded supply, causing bidding wars. In 2017, the second highest penthouse on floors 44, 45 and 46 was put up for sale at ¬£3,500,000. The tower has views over the set of Coronation Street from the north and west fa√ßade. The tower also has expansive vistas over Snowdonia, the South Pennines, the Peak District, the Cheshire Plain, Liverpool Cathedral Blackpool Tower, and Jodrell Bank Observatory on a clear day. Noise during high winds A humming noise emanating from the tower has been heard in Hulme. (Hulme Arch Bridge pictured in foreground) The building has become known for an intermittent hum, or howling, which is heard in windy weather, emanating from the roof's glass blade, and first reported in May 2006 ‚Äì just weeks after the tower opened. The skyscraper was intended to be 50 storeys high rather than 47, but wind load tests showed that it would sway too much because of its slender shape and the 'glass blade' fa√ßade overrun caused by the height reduction has been blamed for the noise. The sound has been heard from about 300 metres away. It is close to the standard musical pitch of B3 (approximately 246.94 hertz) and has been compared to a \\"UFO landing\\". The noise affected production of Coronation Street. Work to reduce or eradicate the noise took place in 2006, 2007 and 2010. Foam pads were installed in 2006, aluminium nosing in 2007 and further work done in February 2010, but attempts to eradicate the noise permanently have been unsuccessful. The architect refused to alter the building after complaints of residents of Manchester. It was suggested that the decorative glass blade could be removed to solve the problem. The humming noise occurred again during Storm Doris in February 2017 and during Storm Ciara in February 2020. Incidents On 11 September 2008, a pane of glass cracked, requiring the street below to be cordoned off. On 29 January 2009, a fire broke out on the 31st floor in Mario Balotelli's flat, and the tower was partially evacuated; one apartment was left uninhabitable. On 14 February 2011, Beetham Hotels Manchester Ltd went into administration. Later in the year, the hotel was sold to Cypriot businessman Loucas Louca. In popular culture The Beetham Tower featured in television programmes Vertical City (2007) for More 4, Britain From Above for BBC One (2008) and Time Travel (2010) for the National Geographic Channel. It is depicted in the opening titles of numerous television programmes ‚Äì including The Street, Coronation Street, and the Manchester sequence of ITV Sport's England football coverage. Scenes for Series 2 of Scott & Bailey were filmed in the reception area of the hotel, although the scenes were set in Bristol. AMC Cinemas can be seen in the outdoor shots. American band Paramore used an audio sample from a video of the tower howling, throughout the track \\"Idle Worship\\" on their 2017 album After Laughter. In an interview with Zane Lowe for Beats 1, guitarist Taylor York admitted to finding out about Beetham Tower online and then went on to sample it in the song.

He was married to Giovanna Berneri, and was father of Marie-Louise Berneri and Giliana Berneri, all of whom were also anarchists.  Biography = Early years  Camillo Berneri was born in Lodi on May 20, 1897. His father was a local redshirt official from Brescia, his mother was a primary school teacher from Emilia and his grandfather was a Carbonari and a follower of Giuseppe Mazzini. His childhood was marked by physical suffering. In just a few months, he became malnourished. In 1904, Camillo fell ill with typhoid fever, and later gastroenteritis. He moved with his family first to Milan, then to Palermo, to Forl√¨, to Varallo Sesia and, finally, to Reggio Emilia. Here, in 1912, Berneri became a member of the Reggio Emilia Socialist Youth Federation. He joined its Central Committee and collaborated with the federation's national organ. But after intense discussions, in particular with Torquato Gobbi, a bookbinder and member of the International Committee of Anarchist Actions, he left the federation in 1915. In an open letter, Bernery criticized the group for its red tape and \\"lack of devotion.\\"Camillo Berneri, Der Arbeiterkult, 1934 (Die Aktion, Nr. 170/174, July 1997) In 1916 he moved to Arezzo where he attended high school. Berneri joined the Italian anarchist movement. He described his departure from socialism with the words: ‚ÄúThe ideal worker of Marxism or socialism is a mythical figure. It stems from the metaphysics of socialist romanticism and is not historically proven.‚Äù He was struck by the gesture of his comrades, who, despite leaving, wanted him to chair their last meeting in Reggio, and the gesture of his mentor Camillo Prampolini, who called him to find out the reasons for their disagreement. Berneri would always point to ‚Äúpleasant memories of the socialist period.‚Äù In 1916, he moved to Arezzo, where he graduated from high school. On January 4, 1917, he married in Giovanna Caleffi, his mother's former pupil. Three months after the wedding, he was called up for military service, however, he was removed from service due to a serious illness. After three years of military service, he was forced to leave the Military Academy of Modena because of his anti-militarist activities. Under protection, he was sent to the front and twice brought before a military court. In 1919 he was confined to the island of Pianosa because of his participation in a general strike on July 20‚Äì21, 1919. Dismissed from the army in 1919, he began to work diligently with the anarchist press and participated in the creation of the Union of Italian Anarchists. Camillo Berneri (Lodi 1897-Barcelona 1937) , Europe of tomorrow, biographical dictionary Being a convinced anti-militarist, he wrote: ‚Äúslaughter, robbery, rape, this is war! To satisfy his lust, the vile person takes on the courage that leaves him when he must save his neighbor from danger or start a dangerous and painful business. In a warmed-up and blood-soaked atmosphere of war, an ordinary person falls into barbarism, and sometimes even turns into a beast.‚Äù In 1920, he actively participated in the seizure of factories in Northern Italy. He also made friends with Errico Malatesta and Luigi Fabbri. After the war, he graduated from the University of Florence, where Camillo was a student of Gaetano Salvemini. He then became a professor of philosophy at the university and later went on to teach philosophy at Camerino. When the fascists seized power, Camillo refused to be loyal to the regime. Berneri's aversion to fascism was ready and decisive, he maintained contact with the Florentine anti-fascists. Berneri's activity in the Union of Italian Anarchists was very intense in those years. When the fascist dictatorship intensified, in May 1926, Berneri was forced to flee the country to France. His wife, Giovanna Berneri, and his daughters Marie Louise Berneri and Giliana Berneri joined him soon after.  Emigration and police harassment  Berneri was arrested in April 1927, after an international conference in L'Ha√ø-les-Roses. On December 11, 1928, he was expelled from France and until 1930 was constantly harassed by the Belgian, French, Dutch, German and Luxembourg police during subsequent transfers and spent a lot of time in prison. He received a residence permit in France only in 1935, shortly before leaving for Spain. However, he continued to be widely published in the anarchist press in Italy, Switzerland, the United States and France. Despite all his limitations, this period allowed him to read books on various topics such as science, psychology and teleology. He wrote anti-religious articles and brochures as well as pieces on the emancipation of women. He also completed his dissertation, The Anti-Semitic Jew, where he studied the forced or voluntary assimilation of Jews. The poet Andre Speer, considered this book ‚Äúof paramount importance‚Äù. Other important writings of his during this time were Spying, Fascist Spying Abroad and Mussolini conquering the Balearic Islands. He also wrote about anarchism, where he defends personal positions:  Spanish Civil War  Camillo Berneri in 1936 Once the Spanish Civil War broke out, Berneri was among the first to rush to Catalonia, the center of a revolution spearheaded by the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo: here he found himself alongside Carlo Rosselli with a large number of Italian and International anti-fascists. Beyond militant solidarity, Carlo Rosselli was tied to his critical support for the prospects of Bolshevism, while in those years Camillo Berneri collaborated with the clandestine organ of the libertarian socialist movement \\"Giustizia e Libert√†\\", arguing with Rosselli on the stark differences between libertarian socialism and despotic socialism. Together with Rosselli, he organized the first column of Italian volunteers to fight on the Aragon front, which were incorporated into the militia column of Joaqu√≠n Ascaso. On August 28, 1936, Camillo Berneri took part in Battle of Monte Pelado near Huesca: ‚ÄúWe defended our position with 130 people against 600, hardened and with strong weapons, for four hours of battle.\\" He eventually needed to leave the front due to medical problems and returned to Barcelona, where he created and was editor-in-chief of the newspaper Class War, also collaborating in the CNT-FAI radio station in Barcelona. During his stay in Barcelona, Berneri came to be under the surveillance of OVRA, the secret police of fascist Italy. Berneri was a staunch defender of the Spanish Revolution and was one of the first to argue that only an anti-capitalist struggle can counter fascism and that the problem with anti-fascism is the rejection of the principles of the Social revolution. He constantly reiterates that revolution must be won on social, not military, grounds. Thus, he opposed the militarization of the militias, which had brought the first victories against state forces. He stood against those who advocated the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúfirst beat Franco‚Äù, and stood for the close connection between the war and the social revolution: ‚ÄúVictory in war is necessary; however, the war will not be won by limiting the problem to the purely military conditions of victory, but by linking them to the political and social conditions of victory. ' Berneri was also very critical of the CNT- FAI's participation in the Republican government. Berneri worried about the growing isolation of the revolutionary and libertarian achievements in Catalonia, Aragon and other regions, and fought vigorously for the close connection of war and revolution. Such is the substance of many of his articles and speeches, such as of the famous open letter to the anarchist Minister of Health Federica Montseny, who with three other anarchists participated in the government of Largo Caballero:Camillo Berneri, -_Lettre_ouverte_a_la_camarade_Frederica_Montseny.html Lettre ouverte √† la camarade Frederica Montseny In his 1936 book Thought and Battle, Berneri gave critical comments on the situation, warning of the danger of a Stalinist coup, and marked his surprise at the \\"anarchist government.\\" His political suggestions for hitting the operational bases of fascism were numerous, though unheeded, such as proclaiming the independence of Morocco, coordinating military efforts and gradually strengthening socialization.  Political assassination  Berneri was soon exposing the fierce repressions carried out by Stalinists that had prevailed since the advent of the government of Juan Negr√≠n: the victims of massacres and disappearances included thousands of non- communists, anarchists and also non-Stalinist communists, like the POUM. On May 5, 1937, Camillo Berneri and his anarchist friend Francesco Barbieri were taken out of their apartment by a dozen plainclothes men with red armbands and policemen. The corpses of the two Italian anarchists were found riddled with bullets. Giovanna Berneri raised the children of Antonio Cieri, who also fell in Spain. On Camillo Berneri's death, the socialist leader Pietro Nenni wrote: \\"If the anarchist Berneri had fallen on a barricade in Barcelona, fighting against the popular government, we would have nothing to say, and in the severity of his destiny we would find the strict law of the revolution. But Berneri was assassinated, and we must say it\\".

The team, created by Kurt Busiek and Tom Grummett, first appeared in JLA #61 (February 2002). They subsequently starred in an eponymous series that ran for eighteen issues, from April 2002 to September 2003, also written by Busiek. Fictional team history Josiah Power was one of America's best lawyers until his meta-gene was triggered during the alien Invasion by the activation of the Gene Bomb.The Unofficial Josiah Power Biography Following the untimely public activation of his metagene in the courtroom, attorney Josiah Power is dismissed from his law firm. Power had little interest in becoming a traditional costumed hero, but it became readily apparent that he could not continue to practice law without any undue public attention. He capitalizes on his professional experience to organize a for- hire team of heroes much along the lines of a law firm. Their very first mission as a team is against the East Asian criminal organization known as the Black Dragon Society. They successfully defuse a hostage situation initiated by the Society and returned to their base of operations. The Power Company make a brief one panel appearance in a later Justice League of America story arc, \\"Syndicate Rules\\" in JLA #107-114 (2004-2005). The Crime Syndicate of America had attacked a S.T.A.R. Labs facility in San Francisco and the Power Company is shown and described to have been defeated.

Power Surge Power Surge was a DC Comics event in 2002 intended to promote the start of The Power Company, a new comic book series by writer Kurt Busiek, who also wrote all seven issues of Power Surge. Power Surge was composed of seven eponymous one-shot issues (although each story had its own title), each highlighting one of the seven primary members of the Power Company. Each story prominently featured the involvement of a classic, already-famous comic book character (with the 'classic' character looming much larger on the cover than the book's nominal main character). Since each issue was essentially an origin story told in the past tense, writer Kurt Busiek could indulge in a playfully retro style reminiscent of DC Comics' 1980s output, and even incorporate characters who were not available under other circumstances, such as the Barry Allen Flash and the Hal Jordan Green Lantern, both of whom were \\"dead\\" in regular DC Comics continuity.

His novels, especially later ones, incorporate many excerpts from newspapers, magazines and other political sources as a way to enlighten the people about a certain political or social issue. Because of his political opinions he was imprisoned during the 1960s; his imprisonment is featured in his first book, That Smell (ÿ™ŸÑŸÉ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿßÿ¶ÿ≠ÿ©), which was one of the first writings in Egyptian literature to adopt a modernist tinge. In harmony with his political ideas, in 2003 he refused to accept a prestigious literary award worth 100,000 Egyptian pounds from Egypt's Ministry of Culture. Life Sonallah Ibrahim was born in Cairo. His father was an upper-middle class civil servant; his mother, from a poor background, had been a nurse hired to look after his father's paralysed first wife. Ibrahim entered Cairo University to study law in 1952.Abdalla F. Hassan, Black Humor in Dark Times, 19 June 2003. There he joined the Marxist Democratic Movement for National Liberation (DMNL). Despite the DMNL's support for Nasser's coup, Nasser moved to repress Communists in the late 1950s.Adam Schatz, Black, not Noir [review of Ibrahim, trans. Robyn Creswell, 'That Smell' and 'Notes from Prison' ], London Review of Books Vol. 35 No. 5 (7 March 2013), pp.15-16. Ibrahim, arrested in 1959, received a seven-year prison sentence from a military tribunal. He was released in 1964 on the occasion of Nikita Khrushchev visiting Egypt for the opening of the Aswan Dam. Writings Hosam Aboul-Ela of the University of Houston described Ibrahim as \\"a relentless internal critic of successive Egyptian regimes\\" and wrote that \\"Ibrahim might best be described as a sort of Egyptian cross between Jonathan Swift and Manuel Puig\\".Aboul-Ela, p. 251. His novels are typically told in the first person, in a cold objective tone resembling press reportage which mimics reality. His main theme seems to be the importance of resisting the influence of the political mega-powers which attempt to invade the third world economically through many ways including the transcontinental companies. As an example, \\"Sharaf\\" [=Honour] deals with the intrusion of American politics in Egypt and includes long passages frankly criticising the big drug companies and their policies in third world countries. His interests are not limited to the situation in Egypt; \\"Beirut..Beirut\\" is something like an overview of the Lebanese civil war of the '70s and '80s, and \\"Warda\\" reveals a little-known episode about the activities of leftists and communists in Yemen and Oman in the '60s and '70s. The title of one of his latest novels is \\"Amricanly\\" which superficially means \\" American\\" or \\"in an American way\\" but is really a parody of another word \\"Othmanly\\" related to the notorious Dark Ages when Turkey ruled Egypt. The word \\"Amricanly\\" in another way is almost a transliteration of the phrase \\"My affairs were mine\\" in Arabic. His novel, \\"The Committee\\" is often described by critics as kafkaesque. In it the protagonist seeks entry into a shadowy organization. He is routinely subject to their vetting process and Sonallah uses his character to make numerous political observations in the form of speeches to the committee. Several of Ibrahim's works also explore how repetition and fastidious attention to detail can be used to examine the themes of childhood innocence, boredom, and sexual frustration. In Stealth, the narrator recounts his childhood memories living with his father in a small, modest apartment. By describing each part of a mundane action, such as hanging up a coat or cooking some eggs, the narrator conveys his childhood curiosity and naivete about the adult world around him. In Ice, extensive repetition of intimate acts, with the same atomistic attention to detail, indicates the narrator's boredom and frustration with life as a foreign student in Soviet Russia.

Other names which were given to the disease are: keloidal blastomycosis, Amazonian blastomycosis, blastomycoid granuloma, miraip and piraip. These last two names were given by natives of the Amazon and mean that which burns. Infected dorsal fin of wild bottle-nosed dolphin, Gulfo Dulce, Costa Rica This disease is usually found in humans and bottlenose dolphins, with the possible risk of transmission from one species to the other. Presentation The disease is endemic in rural regions in South America and Central America.Infection most commonly develops after minor scratches or insect bites, but many patients cannot recall any skin trauma. Human-to-human transmission does not occur, and the disease is only acquired from the environment. The disease manifests as chronic keloidal nodular lesions on the face, ears, or extremities. Lobomycosis lesions on the skin of a bottlenosed dolphin Diagnosis of Lobo's disease is made by taking a sample of the infected skin (a skin biopsy) and examining it under the microscope. Lacazia loboi is characterized by long chains of spherical cells interconnected by tubules. The cells appear to be yeast-like with a diameter of 5 to 12 Œºm. Attempts to culture L. loboi have so far been unsuccessful. Diagnosis=Differential diagnosis The disease is often misdiagnosed as Blastomyces dermatitidis or Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis due to its similar morphology. Treatment Surgical excision or cryosurgery is the treatment of choice. Treatment with antifungals has been considered ineffective, but the use of clofazimine and dapsone in patients with leprosy and lobomycosis has been found to improve the latter. This treatment regimen, with concomitant itraconazole, has been used to prevent recurrence after surgery. Animals Lesions in dolphins occur on the dorsal fin, head, flukes, and peduncle. In January 2006, a potential epidemic of lobomycosis was reported in dolphins of the Indian River Lagoon in Florida.

Mononykus was originally named Mononychus in 1993, but later that year, it was renamed because the original name had already been used for a beetle named by Johann Schueppel, a German entomologist. Description Size of various Alvarezsaurids compared to a human, Mononykus in violet Mononykus was a small dinosaur, only long and 3.5 kg (7.7 lbs). Other characteristics include fused wrist bones similar to those of birds, and a keeled breastbone. It differed from close relatives Shuvuuia and Parvicursor in several details of its skeleton, including a pubic bone that is triangular in cross section, and different proportions in the toe bones. Mononykus is currently represented by a single holotype specimen, catalog number IGM N107/6. This specimen consists of a partial skeleton lacking a tail, and only small fragments of skull bones, including a complete braincase. Several other specimens were later misclassified as Mononykus, including specimens with partial tails (initially misinterpreted as being very short, though later specimens showed they were long and thin) and complete skulls showing a distinct, mostly toothless form.Suzuki, S., Chiappe, L. M., Dyke, G.J., Watabe, M., Barsbold, R., and Tsogtbaatar, K. (2002). \\"A new specimen of Shuvuuia deserti Chiappe et al., 1998 from the Mongolian Late Cretaceous with a discussion of the relationships of alvarezsaurids to other theropod dinosaurs.\\" Contributions in Science, 494: 1‚Äì18. However, these specimens have since been reclassified in the new genus Shuvuuia.Chiappe, L. M., Norell, M. and Clark (1998). \\"The skull of a relative of the stem-group bird Mononykus.\\" Nature, 392: 275‚Äì278. Because of this, many reconstructions of Mononykus in art and mounted skeletons in museums are in fact based mainly on Shuvuuia. While Mononykus was formally described in the 1990s, it was reported that a specimen possibly belonging this genus had already been unearthed by the Andrews expedition decades before. The specimen had been in the American Museum of Natural History collection, labeled simply as \\"bird-like dinosaur\\". However, given the reassignment of the other specimens to related genera, and the difference in age (the AMNH specimen is from the older Djadochta Formation), it is unlikely to be Mononykus.Mortimer, M. (2004), \\"Ornithomimosauria\\" , The Theropod Database, accessed June 30, 2009. Paleobiology phalanx of the first digit Mononykus was a member of the family Alvarezsauridae and, like its relatives, had very strange, stubby forearms with one large, approximately long claw (hence its name). The other two claws had disappeared (however, a close relative of Mononykus, Shuvuuia, had two vestigial claws, alongside one large claw). The purpose of these highly specialized arms is still a mystery, but some scientists have suggested they were used to break open termite mounds (like modern anteaters), and therefore it is possible that they fed primarily on insects.Senter, P. (2005). \\"Function in the stunted forelimbs of Mononykus olecranus (Theropoda), a dinosaurian anteater\\". Paleobiology Vol. 31, No. 3 pp. 373‚Äì381. Mononykus is usually reconstructed with a covering of feathers. Indeed, in the fossil of its relative Shuvuuia feather traces were discovered, proving that Alvarezsauridae were among the theropod lineages with feathery or downy integument.Schweitzer, M. H., J. A. Watt, R. Avci, L. Knapp, L. Chiappe, M. Norell & M. Marshall. (1999). \\"Beta-keratin specific immunological reactivity in feather-like structures of the Cretaceous alvarezsaurid, Shuvuuia deserti.\\" Journal of Experimental Zoology, 285: 146‚Äì157. In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, 15 foot bones referred to Mononykus were examined for signs of stress fracture, but none were found.Rothschild, B., Tanke, D.

As a child, he sold flowers in the resort city of Pattaya to help support his younger siblings. Like many poor boys in Thailand, he took up Muay Thai, and he proved to be a gifted boxer. He switched to international boxing and won a place on the Thai Olympic team in 1976.Bangkok Post, July 8, 2008 Though he finished with a bronze medal, Phayao gained attention by defeating the 1972 Olympic gold medal winner, Gyogy Gedo, in the quarter finals. He trained hard for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, but his hopes for a gold were ended by the United States led boycott over of the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. Instead, he turned professional and on November 27, 1983 became WBC superflyweight world champion by defeating Rafael Orono of Venezuela in a split decision. In his first title defence, against Guty Espadas of Mexico, Phayao was behind on all the score cards, but saved his championship belt with a 10th-round knockout.

Life Born to Jewish parents in Leova, Izmailsky Uyezd, Bessarabia Governorate, Russian Empire, he left Kingdom of Romania for Belgium in 1928 to devote himself entirely to his passion for sculpture and drawing. After completing his military service back home, he returned to Li√®ge and registered at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts de la Ville, where he was awarded first prize for statuary art in 1933. The same year, he married Elisabeth Frenay and moved to Brussels. He took part in the design of the Romanian pavilion for the Exposition internationale universelle in Brussels in 1935 and went on to hold a variety of exhibitions of his own in Brussels, Tel-Aviv, Paris, Amsterdam and several other cities. 1945 was the watershed year: Ianchelevici obtained Belgian nationality, and his famous statue l'Appel (\\"The Call\\") was officially unveiled in La Louvi√®re. 10 years later, Ianchelevici was awarded a grant to work in the Belgian Congo, where he designed three statues intended to supplement the famous Stanley-monument in L√©opoldville (now Kinshasa) and produced a number of outstanding drawings. He subsequently exhibited his work in countries throughout the world. In 1950, he settled in France, at Maisons-Laffitte, where he remained until his death on at the age of 86. A cultural centre in the town now bears his name. Art \\"The exaltation of mankind at the height of its powers\\" is the inspiration for Ianchelevici's work, which explains the ease of monumental compositions such as \\"l'Appel\\" (1939). His figures are expressive and powerful, witness Conspiration (\\"Conspiracy\\", 1932), a piece inspired by the working class struggles of the time, and the Monument national au prisonnier politique (\\"National Monument to the Political Prisoner\\") erected in Breendonk in 1954. The works of Ianchelevici literally step out of the medium. There is no void, no gap: the composition is entirely dictated by the mass and form of its volume (Paternel). From 1945 onwards, Ianchelevici began sculpting marble and stone ‚Äî two notoriously difficult materials which require simplification of form. Limbs grew longer and more supple and the themes moved on, taking inspiration from the unformed, girlish figures of his young subjects. The artist's career underwent a major change at this point, as he embarked upon a ceaseless quest for simpler forms and more schematic faces (Eve, 1980). Alongside his sculpting, Ianchelevici never stopped drawing. His drawings are works of art in their own right, and not always sketches for his sculptures. In both disciplines, however, he draws on the same themes and strives for the same simplicity of form. References * Based on material provided by the Ianchelevici Museum, La Louvi√®re, Belgium.

It meets the needs of parents who wish their children to be educated by a system which enables pupils to continue their understanding of life based on the Christian Faith as taught by the Church of England. The school is located in the Headlands, Kettering. The current headteacher is Miss Jill Silverthorne. Former students of Bishop Stopford are known as Old Stopfordians. Head teachers who served at Bishop Stopford School. 2018- onwards: Miss Jill Silverthorne 2001-2018: Mrs Margaret Holman Past-2001: Mr James Colquhoun History Bishop Stopford School was founded in 1965 as a purpose-built Secondary Modern institution, as a replacement for its precursor, a school founded in 1535 by the rector of St Peter and St Paul. The former bishop of Peterborough, Robert Stopford, agreed to the new school being named after him. Bishop Stopford School soon introduced a sixth form and admitted its first fully comprehensive intake in 1976. The school has benefited from an extensive programme of new buildings and refurbishment over the years to meet the demands of modern-day students and a changing curriculum. In recent years various additional building projects have been undertaken, in particular major expansion and refurbishment of the design and technology department, library, science department, the subsequent construction of the sixth form centre, Octagon building and sports hall. Subsequently, Bishop Stopford School has been nominated for \\"Midlands School of the Year\\" four-years running. In 2008 Bishop Stopford opened its newly re-developed library named after the late teacher Ian Smith, who died from cancer in 2007. On 23 May 2012, Bishop Stopford opened its new extension on the sixth form centre, which features new facilities includes a university- style study area, two seminar rooms and an additional Politics classroom The number-on-roll has more than doubled since 1965 to approximately 1450 students, with a sixth form of approximately 400. The school converted to academy status in August 2011. Houses There are generally eight houses in each year group, each with approximately 27 mixed sex students; students each wear a tie depicting their house colour and coat of arms. These are named after great Church of England cathedrals: Canterbury (silver), Durham (light blue), Ely (orange), Gloucester (emerald green) - collectively known as Band A; and Peterborough (purple), Salisbury (grey), Winchester (red) and York (yellow) - collectively known as Band B. This division is based on the alphabetical placing of the house name. In 1997, due to a large intake, an extra house was created for that year group only, named Lincoln (mint green). School life The school places an emphasis on a Christian ethos of education of school values, the Christian Union and the school chaplain. Running alongside curricular lessons are Eucharists, some of which are of mandatory attendance for all pupils in the school, with more frequent voluntary services. The school has a series of residential trips available during key stage three; students have previously visited various countries including Hawaii, Italy, Australia, Belgium, France and Iceland. In addition to these the school has undertaken international sporting tours involving the sports of rugby, netball and hockey: New Zealand & Fiji (2004), South Africa (2006), Australia (2009) and Malaysia and Singapore (2011). The next planned venture was to Australia and Hong Kong in 2014. In addition, many subject- related day and residential trips are available throughout the school, including fieldwork for subjects such as geography and geology. Affiliations and awards Bishop Stopford is an academy and faith school. The school is also an Anglican Foundation in the Diocese of Peterborough, as well as being a member of the Woodard Corporation; a collection of Church of England Schools. Bishop Stopford was awarded the School Achievement Award in 2002 and the Artsmark Silver.

In 2007 the school gained High Performing Specialist School status as a Leadership Partner School. In May 2009 an OFSTED survey inspection judged development of leadership at Bishop Stopford School and in its partner schools to be outstanding. Sports facilities The school's Community Sports Centre opened in 1999, funded by Sport England, the Foundation for Sport and the Arts and donations from associates of the school. In addition to use for physical education lessons, the facility is intended for use by the wider community. A community Sports Development Officer works in tandem with the school to encourage participation in sport within the community, and promote an ethos of \\"Sport for All\\". In particular the effort focuses on eight target sports; badminton, tennis, netball, trampolining, cricket basketball, football and table tennis. The centre is used by local sports clubs, an aerobics group, and hosts holiday sport and art activities. The PE Faculty runs a wide range of extra curricular provision.

All are welcome in the chapel, regardless of their faith. There are various works of art displayed in the Chapel many of them done by students. The artworks depict themes related to the Christian faith and enhance the feeling of the chapel being a place both of welcome, as well as worship. There are also creative activities laid out around the chapel which are intended to help people to pray in ways that are helpful to them. Several events take place in the chapel during the week, including informal communion services ‚Äì otherwise known as tea and toast, art events in which students explore ways of worshipping God through art, and the CU also meet in the chapel. Charity work SCC (Stopford Charity Committee) is Bishop Stopford School's student fundraising group led by a group of student from all years.. The group started in September 2008 and has a great following from students who want to help raise money for different charities in a fun, exciting way. SCC's main aim is \\"getting the whole school working together to raise money for charity in new and fun exciting ways.\\" The group organises all the non-uniform days to raise money for the school chosen charities. The charity group (committee) is always led by a 6th form student and a group of lower school students. \\"Charity Raisers\\" (CR) was another Charity Group that existed between 2008 and 2010. Its main money raisers were from its live charity shows, starring staff and students. All money raised from these events went straight to the chosen charity at the time including Red Nose Day, Children in Need, Donna's Dream House Blackpool, PoverTee Day and Trusts set up in memory of past students.

Sixth form Bishop Stopford School Sixth Form is a community of approximately 400 students offering 30 subjects. Standards at A level continue to be impressive; approximately 150 students go on to university every year. Most students enroll on 3 AS courses in Year 12 provided they have sufficient GCSE grades. High achievers may take up to 4 subject-specific AS courses in Year 12 which are likely to reduce to 3 or continue at 4 in Year 13. Opportunities to take Advanced Extension Awards are also provided and there are also the possibilities of taking undergraduate modules in a variety of disciplines from the Open University through the Young Applicants in Schools and Colleges Scheme. A separate Sixth Form Centre exists with its own social area and specialist staff. Building work has recently been completed to provide a new state-of-the-art extension which doubles the amount of floor space to provide tutorial rooms, offices and large university style study area. An annual trip is organised to either Hawaii and San Francisco or Canyonlands which is open to all students and is a particular bonus to being in the Sixth Form. Subject specific trips are also arranged to complement individual courses. A Head Boy and Girl are elected every spring in Year 12 and hold the position through Year 13. They perform a number of leadership duties and are important ambassadors of the school. Heads of Sixth Form Forum are also elected to chair meetings with students and staff where any issues can be raised and discussed to the benefit of all. Student Liaison Heads provide a bridge for students who may be having difficulties settling into the Sixth Form with the External Student Liaison Head particularly focusing on students who have joined from other schools. There is an Events Committee run by a Student Events President. Social events are organised throughout the two years of Sixth Form culminating in the Sixth Form Ball prior to the final A-level exams. Bishop Stopford receives applications from students at other schools who wish to join the Sixth Form. Nearly a half of the Sixth Form students join from other schools across Northamptonshire, Leicestershire and Rutland. School Council and politics The Student Council is made up of two representatives from each year, year 7 to year 11 drawn from each of the Year Councils. They meet six times each year and push for action to be taken to make the school environment a better place for both students and staff. The Sixth Form regularly holds mock elections, in the last one in 2015, won by the Labour Party. Other parties that took part were the Conservative Party who finished 2nd and the Liberal Democrats who finished 3rd. Another mock election took place on 11 December 2019 ReferencesExternal links * Bishop Stopford School * The Woodard Corporation - Church of England Schools Category:Academies in Northamptonshire Category:Woodard Schools Category:Church of England secondary schools in the Diocese of Peterborough Category:Educational institutions established in the 1530s Category:1535 establishments in England Category:Secondary schools in Northamptonshire ","title":"Bishop Stopford School"},{"id":"3810409","text":"Vincent Anthony Scelsa (born December 12, 1947, in Bayonne, New Jersey) is an American broadcaster who was at \\"the forefront of the FM radio revolution\\" as the host of several freeform radio programs, the best-known titled Idiot's Delight. His eclectic mix of music, reviews, and lengthy interviews with authors and artists has established Scelsa as a fixture in late night New York City radio for decades. Early life He attended Upsala College in East Orange, New Jersey, where he spent his early broadcasting years in several functions at the college's station, WFMU. He hosted his first show there in November 1967. Scelsa originally considered becoming a Jesuit priest before pursuing a career in radio. Commercial Radio Scelsa went on to work in commercial radio first on Long Island in the early 1970s at WLIR and at non- commercial WBAI-FM in New York City. He became road manager for singer- songwriter Townes Van Zandt and also worked for Poppy Records. On February 14, 1971, while he was music director and a DJ at WABC-FM, the station changed its call letters to WPLJ, an acronym for and homage to the song, performed by The Four Deuces in 1955 and the Mothers of Invention in 1970, called \\"White Port and Lemon Juice.\\" When WPLJ restricted the air personalities' ability to pick their own music to play, Scelsa moved to WNEW-FM 102.7 where he hosted late nights and evenings from 1973 through 1982. In 1981 he was namechecked on The Ramones' \\"It's Not My Place (In the 9 to 5 World)\\" on the album Pleasant Dreams. Similarly, when WNEW instituted fixed playlists for all personalities in 1982, Scelsa moved on again. He surfaced briefly once again at WLIR before devoting the next two years to off-air endeavors. He joined then-new rock station WXRK-FM 92.3 K-Rock in 1985 and hosted a freeform program there through the end of 1995. His Sunday night show at K-Rock became known as \\"Idiot's Delight,\\" and many fans of the show participated in the online e-mail group \\"Idiot's Delight Digest.\\" In January 1996, K-Rock changed its format from Classic Rock to Alternative Rock (except for Howard Stern in the morning who remained all talk). Scelsa opted to leave the station rather than restrict his playlist to the newer rock and shortly thereafter returned to WNEW-FM where he continued hosting \\"Idiot's Delight\\". For a period of time at WNEW, Vin channeled his doubts regarding the station's commitment to his show by playing a different version of the standards chestnut \\"I'll Be Seeing You\\" each week. Yet Vin remained in place at WNEW through several programming formats until the end of 2000. During the last years of this WNEW stint, \\"Idiot's Delight\\" usually did not have a fixed ending time. Rather, the show was officially scheduled to run from 8:00pm Sunday nights through 2:00am Monday mornings, but in actuality ended as late as 4:30am, depending upon when Vin felt the show had reached an appropriate conclusion. The final 'Idiots Delight' on WNEW was particularly memorable. It aired on December 31, 2000, and ended at around 3:30am on January 1, 2001. Return to Public Radio, and Satellite Scelsa announced that \\"Idiot's Delight\\" was moving to noncommercial WFUV/90.7 FM, the voice of Fordham University. He also briefly hosted an internet only radio show called \\"Live at Lunch\\" during 2000 and 2001 which he broadcast from his home or from a custom-built studio at J&R; Music World. His WFUV program was one of the few to not be streamed on the internet initially, because Scelsa preferred to be free of the online regulations of the period which limited the programming of multiple tracks from an artist or album without special permission. In addition to the Saturday night WFUV broadcasts, Scelsa began hosting 2 additional hours of \\"Idiot's Delight\\" live on both Wednesday and Thursday afternoons (noon ‚Äì 2pm ET) for Sirius/XM Satellite Radio's \\"The Loft,\\" (Initially called Sirius Disorder), (Channel 30). The four weekly hours of Sirius/XM shows are repeated early Friday mornings and on Sunday nights, 8pm to midnight ET, the original time slot of the WNEW and K-Rock shows. On his March 28, 2015, WFUV show, Scelsa announced he would be retiring from radio.http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/vin-scelsa-host-of-radios- idiots-delight-to-retire/ His last show on SiriusXM aired on April 30, 2015, and his final radio show aired on WFUV on May 2, 2015. Other Projects Scelsa served as the music editor of Penthouse Magazine from 1988 to 1992 and was the co-creator of a musical series with the lengthy name In Their Own Words: A Bunch Of Songwriters Sittin' Around Singing at The Bottom Line in New York City.. For several years in the mid-90s, Scelsa selected music for a Time-Life records music series called 'Grooves.' Many CDs in the series included a live performance from 'Idiots Delight,' and Scelsa wrote the liner notes. Scelsa has also appeared on stage numerous times, most notably as Vladimir in the Luna Stage production of Waiting for Godot. Personal life In 2006 he underwent successful surgery for prostate cancer. On his WFUV show of September 16, 2006, he announced a schedule change which he attributed to his health problems. For a short time \\"Idiot's Delight\\" presented new programming only from 8 to 10pm on Saturdays, with archived material (from both WFUV and his earlier programs) from 10pm to midnight. On December 13, 2007 (a few weeks after celebrating his 40th anniversary on New York radio, and the day after his 60th birthday) Vin was the recipient of the prestigious ASCAP Deems Taylor Radio Broadcast Award, presented at The Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Home of Jazz at Lincoln Center. Scelsa was praised for \\"outstanding coverage of music on his long-running show Idiot's Delight\\" (as heard on WFUV broadcast radio and Sirius/XM Satellite Radio). Songwriter Marilyn Bergman, President and chairman of the board of ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers) stated in her presentation of the award, \\"Vin Scelsa, a mainstay of New York radio for four decades, is one of the last true free-form radio hosts... He is a champion of new and untested music and, with his devoted listening public, an important tastemaker.\\" In accepting the award, Vin thanked New York radio veterans Bob Fass (an early mentor and role model), Scott Muni (WNEW-FM air personality and program director) for trusting Vin with total freedom on a major commercial radio station) and air personality Alison Steele (who taught him about the painful struggle faced by women in broadcasting well into the 1970s). Scelsa also acknowledged the many general managers and program directors who tended to ignore him and pass him along from one to the next, rather like an enigmatic \\"grandfather clause.\\" He tipped his hat to a mysterious \\"rabbi named Mel\\" ‚Äì in thanks for whatever it is the rabbi does or doesn't do to protect him from the harsh realities of 21st Century radio. This tribute is thought to have been a reference to veteran Infinity Broadcasting/CBS/Viacom/Sirius-XM radio executive Mel Karmazin. He thanked his parents for being constant radio listeners ‚Äì post WWII the radio was always on in the Scelsa household: Mom listening to her soaps and talk shows on WOR and Dad digging Sinatra and Basie and the Milkman's Matinee program on WNEW(AM). But most of all he thanked Freddie, the girl he met when they were both 17-year-old seniors in high school. They married in 1970 and have been together ever since. Vin said he enjoyed success, freedom and longevity in his radio career because of Freddie's support, generosity, understanding, patience and love. \\"Without Freddie there is no way I would be standing on this stage in this beautiful room accepting this remarkable honor tonight.\\" Scelsa has ended his radio programs since the late-70s WNEW-FM overnight shifts with the closing sound- clip from the movie \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", where Judy Garland in her role as Dorothy says \\"Oh Auntie Em, there's no place like home,\\" and the orchestra breaks into the melody of \\"Over the Rainbow.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Vin Scelsa, Fare Thee Well *Idiot's Delight Message Board *Audio Archive of Idiot's Delight Shows (VINdication) *The Idiot's Delight Digest *Complete Archive of the Idiot's Delight Digest *The Idiot's Delight Digest Information Hub *Free-Form D.J.

His parents were the merchant Edward Strakosch and his wife Mathilde, (n√©e Winters). He was born at Hohenau, Austria, and educated at the Wasa Gymnasium in Vienna and privately in England. He entered banking in the City of London in 1891, then began working for the Anglo- Austrian Bank of South Africa in the 1895. Strakosch became a naturalized British citizen in 1907. He served as a financial adviser to the South African government, and was the author of the 1920 South African Currency and Banking Act. He was chairman of the South African goldminers, Union Corporation from 1924. He was a member of the Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance during 1925 and 1926. He later served on the Council of India between 1930 and 1937, served as a delegate for India at the Imperial Economic Conference in 1932, and acted as adviser to the Secretary of State for India between 1937 and 1942. Strakosch was knighted in 1921, then created a KBE in 1924, and promoted GBE in 1927. He was awarded an honorary degree of LLD at Manchester University in 1938. He was chairman of The Economist between 1929 and 1943. Strakosch being a Jew and his involvement in the payment of the private debts of Sir Winston Churchill, in 1938 and again in June 1940, has been cited as evidence of Jewish involvement in British politics in the run up to World War Two. Strakosch had supplied Churchill with figures on German arms expenditure during the latter's political campaign for rearmament against the Nazi regime, and the financial arrangement enabled Churchill to withdraw his home Chartwell from sale at a time of financial pressures. Strakosch also bequeathed Churchill ¬£20,000 in his will. Strakosch was unmarried until 1941 when he married Mabel Elizabeth Vincent, daughter of John Curnow Millett of Pempol, Cornwall, and widow of Joseph Temperley, a shipowner. He died at his home, after an unsuccessful operation, at Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in 1943 aged seventy-two.

April 1592 ‚Äì November 19, 1679) was an English colonist and drysalter credited for establishing the communities of Salem, Peabody, and Danvers, Massachusetts (Peabody and Danvers were part of Salem during his lifetime). Conant arrived at Plymouth Colony from London in 1624, where he became associated with Puritan opposition and subsequently led the settlement to outlying areas, including the site of an ancient Native American village and trading center, which would later become Salem. Conant's leadership provided the stability to survive the first two years, but John Endecott, one of the new arrivals, replaced him by order of the Massachusetts Bay Company. Conant graciously stepped aside and was granted 200 acres (0.81 km2) of land in compensation. Conant died in Beverly, Massachusetts on November 19, 1679. Early life Roger Conant was baptized in East Budleigh, Devonshire on April 9, 1592. He was the son of Richard Conant and Agnes (n√©e Clarke). He would later move to London, where he became a drysalter.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History & People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 269 Life in New England Contrary to some accounts that Roger Conant and his family arrived in 1623 in the ship Anne, per Banks, only Roger's brother Christopher Conant is listed as being on the Anne in 1623. In Bradford's history, in addition to letters to him by the London Adventurers, mention is made of an unnamed master or journeyman salter who may have arrived in Plymouth in the Charity in March 1623/24. It is thought that Bradford may have been describing Conant, and that he arrived in Plymouth in 1624.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History & People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 269, 270William Hubbard, A general history of New England In 1625, Bradford learned of the death of John Robinson, the long- time minister of their exiled congregation in Leiden, Netherlands. Robinson had been the driving force behind all their efforts to find a better place than England to live their lives and it was he who cared for the many left at the Leiden congregation after the Mayflowers departure. After the dispiriting news of Robinson's death, those in Plymouth began to lose the fervor that helped them survive the grim early years there and began to fear that all they had gained might eventually be destroyed. These dark thoughts turned into mean-spirited fanaticism. At about that time, John Lyford, a minister who had been sent over by the London Adventurers, was expelled from Plymouth for secretly meeting with settlers who wished to return to the type of worship that they had back in England. One of Lyford's supporters, John Oldham, was forced to run a gauntlet while Pilgrims beat him with the butt-ends of their muskets. This punishment received the approval of Pilgrim leader Edward Winslow. The Adventurers were quite displeased over what had happened to one of their men and criticized the Pilgrims as ‚Äúcontentious, cruel and hard hearted, among your neighbors‚Ä¶‚Äù. Bradford later in his writings wrote that he thought that Lyford and Oldham deserved their punishments. These actions against the rebellion of Lyford and Oldham were possibly the reason Roger Conant left Plymouth for other locations where he would later continue to be in association with them against the Plymouth authorities. In the years prior to and also after John Robinson's death, Plymouth Colony had lost about a quarter of its residents. They had moved to other areas of New England or gone back to England, or to Virginia. Some, such as salter Roger Conant, found a place to work and worship peacefully in the fishing and trading outposts along the New England coast at Nantasket and Cape Ann. Per Hubbard's General History, about 1624 Conant moved to Nantasket with his family and about a year or so later relocated to Cape Ann, at the north end of Massachusetts Bay. In another case of the new Pilgrim vindictiveness, in 1625 Roger Conant was involved in a violent situation between Plymouth Colony military Captain Myles Standish and some fishermen on Cape Ann. Conant was so shocked by the violence the Plymouth captain displayed that Conant later reported the incident in detail for Pilgrim historian William Hubbard. In restating John Robinson's earlier concerns about the way the colony was turning to fanaticism and violence, Hubbard wrote, \\"Captain Standish‚Ä¶never entered the school of our Savior Christ‚Ä¶or, if he was ever there, had forgot his first lessons, to offer violence to no man.\\" Hubbard also wrote about Standish; \\"so was the Plymouth captain, a man of very little stature, yet of a very hot and angry temper.\\" In 1626 Conant was chosen as the first governor of the English settlers on Cape Ann (who soon moved from Gloucester to Salem) and was replaced in 1628/9 by Gov. John Endecott. Conant initially lived in a \\"great house\\" in what is now Stage Fort Park in Gloucester. Governor Endecott had the house moved to Salem in 1628.Endicott, Charles M. (1847) Memoir of John Endicott, first governor of the colony of Massachusetts Bay (via archive.org) An old fort in Gloucester was renamed from Stage Fort to Fort Conant in his honor during the Civil War.Stage Fort at American Forts Network Later years in Salem Conant's house after its relocation from Cape Ann (now Gloucester) to Salem Conant built the first Salem house on what is now Essex Street, opposite the Town Market. In 1630 he was chosen as a freeman, or voting stockholder of the Massachusetts Bay Company. Conant was one of the first two Salem representatives to the colony's general court or legislature, and was repeatedly elected a selectman by the people of Salem. When the legislature granted communities the right to establish district courts, Roger Conant served on numerous Salem quarterly juries for sixteen years. He also was involved in civic activities over the years such as establishing town boundaries and laying out land grants. Roger Conant was active in the affairs of Salem throughout his life. In 1639, his signature was one of the first ones on the contract for enlarging the meeting house in Town Square for the First Church in Salem. This document remains a part of the town records at City Hall. During his very long lifetime Conant had a number of family tragedies, including the death of his wife Sarah, and of sons Caleb, Lot, Roger and Joshua. Only his son Exercise and possibly several daughters succeeded him.Roger Conant in Salem Family Roger Conant and Sarah Horton married at St. Ann Blackfriars, London on November 11, 1618 and had nine or ten children. She was alive in November 1660 and may have died before March 1677/78 as she was not named in her father's will. Her burial place is unknown. Children of Roger and Sarah Conant: * Sarah was baptized at St. Lawrence Jewry, London on September 19, 1619 and was buried there October 30, 1620. * Caleb was baptized at St. Lawrence Jewry, London on May 27, 1622. He died in England before November 11, 1633, when his uncle, John Conant, became administrator of his estate. * Lot was born about 1624 and died September 29, 1674. He married Elizabeth Walton and had ten children. The marriage of their descendant Hannah Conant (d.1810) with Josiah Dodge (d.1785/90) in 1761 connected the line of Mayflower passenger Richard More with the Conant family. The marriage of their descendant John Conant (1814-1903) with Elvira Bradford (1820-1897) in 1842 connected the Conant line to the line of eight Mayflower passengers: William Bradford, William Mullins, Priscilla Mullins, John Alden, William Brewster, Mary Brewster, Love Brewster, and Richard Warren. After Lot‚Äôs death, Elizabeth married Andrew Mansfield in Lynn on January 10, 1681/82. * Roger was born in Salem and died in June 1672. He married Elizabeth Weston by 1661 and had two children. * Sarah was born about 1628. She married John Leach and had ten children. * Joshua was born about 1630 and died in England in 1659. He married Seeth Gardner by 1657 and had one son. * Mary was born about 1632. :She married: :1. John Balch about 1652 and had one daughter. :2.

He was reportedly buried in Burying Point Cemetery in Salem.Memorial of Roger Conant Statue in Salem In 1913, the Conant Family Association approved sculptor Henry Hudson Kitson's design for a bronze sculpture of Roger Conant. Kitson's dramatic design features Conant overlooking Salem Common, shrouded in a billowing heavy cloak. The sculpture was installed atop a boulder taken from nearby Lynn, Massachusetts. Because of the cloak, wide-brimmed hat, and its proximity directly outside the Salem Witch Museum, visitors to the area often mistake Conant for a witch.

Publication history Greg Rucka and Shawn Martinbrough created the character in Detective Comics #742 (March 2000). Allen later went on to be one of the main characters in Gotham Central. After he was killed by a corrupt police technician named Jim Corrigan (who has no connection with the Jim Corrigan who was a host of the Spectre), Allen became the third host for the Spectre. Fictional character biography=GCPD MCU Originally from Metropolis, Detective Crispus Allen was a fortysomething police veteran transferred to Gotham City where he was partnered with detective Renee Montoya on the Gotham City Police Department's Major Crimes Unit. Allen had a loving wife and two teenaged sons, whom he put above his job and the safety of others when Gotham was in crisis. Allen saw Batman as a necessary evil, not wanting to deal with him but tolerating his presence. Their occasional interactions illustrated his views on Batman, notably during Brian Azzarello's \\"Broken City\\" storyline. Allen was an agnostic who doubted the existence of God in spite of his family's strong faith. Jim Corrigan One night Allen and his partner, Renee Montoya, spotted gang members apparently preparing for some sort of violent action. Allen requested backup, but the two opted not to wait for the backup to arrive. Following the gang into a deserted building, the detectives found several murdered men as well as two large gang members. Allen tailed the suspects while Montoya scouted the rest of the building. The Black Spider suddenly appeared at the crime scene, firing upon Montoya. The first few shots hit Montoya, but she was protected by her bulletproof vest. Black Spider then aimed at her head, but Allen shot and killed the villain before he could pull the trigger. The Internal Affairs department subsequently questioned Allen regarding the incident, confiscated his gun, and put him on temporary leave until his story could be corroborated. Complications arose when a crime scene technician named Jim Corrigan stole important evidence -- a bullet of Black Spider's that struck a rival gang member -- from the scene, putting Allen's career in jeopardy. The Internal Affairs investigator in charge of Allen's case told Montoya about the missing bullet and suggested Corrigan's connection to its disappearance. Montoya found Corrigan and forced him to reveal the location of the bullet. After it was recovered, Allen was allowed to return to active duty. However, Montoya's actions destroyed an ongoing Internal Affairs investigation into Corrigan's misconduct. This left Allen angry and disappointed in her because he had secretly started his own investigation of Corrigan, which Montoya's actions also compromised. Allen continued his investigation (which took place during the events of Infinite Crisis), but Corrigan was tipped off. Corrigan found Allen's informant and beat him to death. Corrigan let Allen find the informant's body before shooting Allen in the back and killing him (in Gotham Central #38). By tampering with the evidence at the crime scene, Corrigan managed to evade prosecution. Allen's unavenged death pushed Montoya to an emotional breakdown, and she subsequently decided to quit the force in disgust at the system. The Spectre Crispus Allen as the Spectre, from a panel from Tales of the Unexpected #1 (December 2006), art by Eric Battle. While Allen's body is in the morgue, the Presence forces the Spectre to accept Allen as his new host.Infinite Crisis #4 (March 2006) Later, the magic users of Earth assemble at Stonehenge to call forth the Spectre and usher in the new age of magic. Allen appears in a ghostly version of his own form before making his first official transformation into the Spectre. The Spectre then kills Star Sapphire and two others for their past crimes before vanishing, leaving the assembled magic users confused and fearful. In the first issue of Infinite Crisis Aftermath: The Spectre, \\"Dead Again Part One\\", the Spectre confronts Crispus Allen. He has come to realize that he needs a host to humanize him in order to know what his mission really means. Allen refuses his request, wanting no further involvement in the Spectre's vigilante work. The Spectre then leaves Allen for a year (presumably about the same as the year depicted in 52). During that time, Allen sees that he cannot help or communicate with his family, still shattered because Jim Corrigan will not be called to account for Allen's murder. In addition, while the former detective can solve crimes ‚Äî and even learns Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne ‚Äî he cannot bring the culprits to justice.Crisis Aftermath: The Spectre #1 (July 2006) This includes Corrigan, his own killer. After a year of being unseen and powerless, Allen receives another visit from the Spectre. This time he finally takes the offer, and becomes the Spectre's human host. Their first mission together is to bring ghoulishly appropriate justice to a child molester. While troubled, Allen is satisfied by the knowledge that \\"He [the Spectre] needs me more than I need him\\". Allen works with the Spectre for a while, choosing whom to visit punishment upon. The Spectre informs Allen there is one more punishment to be enacted before the two can fully bond. Allen sees his killer stumbling out of a bar and revels in the chance to gain revenge. Malcolm Allen, his son, appears and despite Crispus' attempts, kills Corrigan. Crispus then passes judgement on his own son, who dies peacefully in his arms. He thinks this means his son is doomed to hell, but the Spectre explains they just judge, not condemn. Crispus then chooses to fully bond with the Spectre.Crisis Aftermath: The Spectre #3 (September 2006) In Countdown To Mystery, Allen and the Spectre, accompanied by the spirit of a criminal they killed, set out to foil Eclipso's plans to corrupt superheroes. During the climactic battle between Spectre and Eclipso, Allen realizes that, if the Spectre kills his opponent, it will result in him going down a path of destruction. Allen appeals to Bruce Gordon, who is able to take control of Eclipso. Final Crisis The Spectre is one of the main characters in the miniseries Final Crisis: Revelations. The Spectre/Crispus first took vengeance upon Doctor Light for all of his crimes against humanity, then was sent to enact vengeance on Libra for the death of the Martian Manhunter. Libra was somehow unaffected by the Spectre's powers and nearly killed him, but the Spectre used his powers to escape. Afterward, Allen swore that he would no longer do as God said, attempting to revoke his status as the Spectre, but was instead called by God to enact vengeance on his former partner Renee Montoya for her sins.Final Crisis: Revelations #1 (October 2008) He was stopped in his judgment by Radiant, the Spirit of Mercy, another loyal servant of the Presence tasked with granting God's mercy to repentant beings or those forced to act against their pure intentions. The Radiant admonished Crispus Allen about using his powers in a more responsible way, changing the world as the former host of the Spectre did instead of enacting retribution over one soul at time. Radiant's forgiveness caused Allen to suffer a crisis of faith, demanding to know why Renee was forgiven whereas Allen was forced to kill his own son. Meanwhile, in a world corrupted by Darkseid and the Anti- Life Equation, the Cult of the Stone, a religious sect devoted to the adoration of Cain, used the Spear of Destiny, carelessly misplaced by Allen himself while judging Montoya, to resurrect Cain in the body of Vandal Savage. Cain agreed to lead his forces against the Spectre in retaliation for his curse.Final Crisis: Revelations #2 (November 2008) Using the Spear of Destiny, Cain stabbed the Spectre and separated him from Allen, effectively killing the human host.Final Crisis: Revelations #4 (January 2009) The Spectre was placed under Cain's control and Allen's spirit departed the scene and visited his son's grave. When Montoya managed to take the spear from Cain and purify it, freeing the Spectre, Allen willingly returned to his role as its human host after Montoya used the spear to revive his son. United, they defeated Cain and the Cult of Crime. Allen thanked Montoya for her assistance before the Presence called him and the Radiant on to their next mission.Final Crisis: Revelations #5 (February 2009) The Spectre and The Radiant are later seen in the final issue of Final Crisis, having been defeated by Mandrakk the Dark Monitor.Final Crisis #7 (March 2009) A short time later, Crispus assists the immortal adventurer known as Xombi in tracking down the vengeful spirit of a serial killer who is murdering vampires and other supernatural creatures.Brave and the Bold (Volume 3) #26 (October 2009) Blackest Night Black Hand reveals that the Spectre must be moved out of the way in order for the universe to be at peace. He sends several black rings to latch onto Crispus' body, transforming him into a Black Lantern, and sealing the Spectre within him.Blackest Night #2 (October 2009) On Coast City, Hal Jordan encounters the Black Lantern Spectre. Using the real Spectre's power to protect itself, it is rendered immune to the combination of Emotional lights that usually destroy Black Lanterns. Hal allows himself to be possessed by Parallax once more in order to stop him.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #50 (January 2010) Parallax tears into the Black Lantern's body, freeing the real Spectre and destroying the facsimile. Parallax then attempts to destroy the Spectre, who uses his own power, coupled with the love Carol Ferris feels for Hal, to separate Parallax from its host.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #51 (February 2010) Other versions=Batman: Year 100 In the alternate future limited series Batman: Year 100, there is a scene where James Gordon (the son of Barbara Gordon and the grandson of his namesake) is going through his grandfather's belongings. He briefly finds a photograph of Crispus from 2006, and remarks that he \\"looks so young\\". In other media=Television Andrew Stewart-Jones portrays Crispus Allen in the Fox TV series Gotham. He appears as a detective at Gotham City Police Department, where he works in the Major Crimes Unit and is partnered with Renee Montoya. Allen is not a main character for season two. Film * Gary Dourdan voices Detective Crispus Allen in the 2008 Warner Premiere animated feature Batman: Gotham Knight in the segments \\"Crossfire\\", \\"In Darkness Dwells\\", and \\"Deadshot\\". He is depicted as the partner of Detective Anna Ramirez. In the film, he originally despised Batman's vigilantism. However, after the Dark Knight saved him and his partner from a gang war between Sal Maroni and the Russian mob, Allen begins to see that Batman's presence is necessary in Gotham, even though he still does not approve of vigilantes. In segment six, Allen is seen acting as the go-between for Batman and Gordon, as word has been received that Gordon has been targeted for assassination, so Allen must inform Batman of the Deadshot threat. * Crispus Allen is also present in the DC Extended Universe, played by Kobna Holdbrook-Smith. ** In Justice League, Allen discusses sightings of Parademons with Commissioner Gordon, suggesting that Batman may have been the culprit.

The skull of the Callovian plesiosaur Cryptoclidus eurymerus, and the sauropterygian cheek. Palaeontology 37.4 (1994): 941.  Discovery  Cryptoclidus was a plesiosaur whose specimens include adult and juvenile skeletons, and remains which have been found in various degrees of preservation in England, Northern France, Russia, and South America. Its name, meaning \\"hidden clavicles\\", refer to its small, practically invisible clavicles buried in its front limb girdle. The type species was initially described as Plesiosaurus eurymerus by Phillips (1871). The species name \\"wide femur\\" refers to the forelimb, which was mistaken for a hindlimb at the time.  Classification  Skeleton of Cryptoclidus oxoniensis (AMNH 995) Life restoration The cladogram below follows the topology from Benson et al. (2012) analysis.  Paleobiology  Life reconstruction of Cryptoclidus eurymerus The fragile build of the head and teeth preclude any grappling with prey, and suggest a diet of small, soft-bodied animals such as squid and shoaling fish. Cryptoclidus may have used its long, intermeshing teeth to strain small prey from the water, or perhaps sift through sediment for buried animals. The size and shape of the nares and nasal openings have led Brown and Cruickshank (1994) to argue that they were used to sample seawater for smells and chemical traces.Brown and Cruickshank, 1994  Distribution  Fossils of Cryptoclidus have been found in the Oxford Clay of Cambridgeshire, England. The dubious species Cryptoclidus beaugrandi is known from Kimmeridgian-age deposits in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France.Bologne-sur-Mer at Fossilworks.org Cryptoclidus vignalensis hails from the Jagua Formation of western Cuba.

The station is owned by Salem Media Group, and is located on 950 kHz on the AM dial. Most of WROL's programming is religious including local ministers as well as national radio hosts such as Dr. Charles Stanley, Jay Sekulow and Eric Metaxas. Former WBZ-TV news anchor-turned-minister Liz Walker also has a program on the station. WROL also airs several Irish music blocks on weekends, including the Irish Hit Parade on Saturdays and A Feast of Irish Music on Sundays. WROL operates with 5000 watts by day but must reduce power to 90 watts at night to protect other stations on 950 kHz. WROL uses a non- directional transmitter located off Route 107 in the Rumney Marsh Reservation in Saugus, Massachusetts. WROL is one of three religious formatted radio stations in the Boston media market owned by Salem Communications; WEZE also airs religious programming, while WWDJ carries Spanish-language religious programming. History WROL's history dates back to 1927 and WBSO, owned by Babson College. The station moved to Boston in 1935 after a sale and became WORL. During the late 1930s, WORL was the first station in Boston to adopt a popular-music format (\\"The 920 Club\\", named after the station's former frequency; the title remained even after the move to 950 on March 29, 1941) with disc jockeys spinning the tunes. Although only a daytimer then, WORL built up a following as an entertaining alternative to the daytime programming elsewhere on the Boston radio dial. The owners, Harold A. Lafount and two others (operating for the interests of Arde Bulova) became embroiled in a long-running dispute with the FCC for having filed false reports regarding ownership and financial structure, and in 1947 their license renewal was rejected. After an appeals process that went to the U.S. Supreme Court, the rejection was upheld. The station, which had stayed on the air via temporary licenses, went off the air on May 30, 1949. Pilgrim Broadcasting purchased the license and returned the station to the air in October 1950. Later sales led to the station becoming WRYT, with WORL being taken by a station near Orlando, Florida. Carter Broadcasting took over in 1977, and after failing to be able to return the WORL call letters to Boston, settled on WROL. Carter immediately established a religious network with WROL as its flagship, with relays throughout New England. While mostly religious, WROL featured two popular programs during the 1970s and 1980s, a weekday cooking show with longtime Boston radio/TV personality Gus Saunders, and a Saturday block of Irish music featuring John Latchford, and later Paul Sullivan and Matt O'Donnell (among others) which became quite popular among the region's large Irish-American population. In recent years, WROL has expanded Irish music to Sunday afternoons as well. In 2001, as part of Carter Broadcasting dismantling this network and focusing its attention to WCRN in Worcester, the station was sold to Salem Communications. History of call letters The call letters WROL were previously assigned to an AM station in Knoxville, Tennessee. WROL-AM 620 in Knoxville, Tennessee in the early '40s employed a then-little-known news announcer who went on to country stardom: Tennessee Ernie Ford. WROL's complete 1,000 watt radio transmitter and wire-array antenna was hand built by the station Engineer Joseph Wofford. The original transmitter was later encased in a glass cabinet and placed in the lobby of the studio.

All of the major Jetix Europe originals, including A.T.O.M., ranked \\"as one of the top two shows in their timeslots in all of the markets in which they aired.\\" Common Sense Media, in their review of the show said: \\"The animation here ‚Äî a blend of classic comic book and anime ‚Äî is pretty good.\\" and that \\"because of its relatively high level of cartoon violence [...] A.T.O.M. is best for older grade schoolers.\\" and awarded the series 2 out of 5 stars. Other media=Toyline Hasbro launched a line of action figures to tie-in with the show, marketed as a reboot of Hasbro's discontinued Action Man toy line. Distinctly different from other Action Man lines, A.T.O.M. figures were the standard size of normal action figures and not of a doll format. Much like Action Man however, these figures are sold individually, usually with figure accessories, from the vehicles distributed to accompany them. The franchise has vastly similar concepts to the 1980s' M.A.S.K. story line from Kenner (which Hasbro bought in 1991), even down to the code name lettering, as each vehicle for the A.T.O.M. members changes from one ordinary looking terrain vehicle to anything that ranges from a jet car with unfolding door wings, to a bike that soon propels its driver into the air as a helicopter. In 2007, Hasbro released 12-inch versions of A.T.O.M. action figures, similar to the original Action Man action figures. The toy series was composed mostly of several versions of Axel Manning, the main character, and Paine, Flesh and Tilian as the villains. A plane, a sport car and several minor vehicles were included for this line of A.T.O.M. toys. The line was discontinued shortly thereafter. Comic book Panini Comics published a tie-in comic book series in the United Kingdom from 2006 to 2007. This title replaced their long-running Action Man series and featured stories by Simon Furman.'The Doomsday Key!', Action Man: A.T.O.M., Panini Comics, issue 8, 5 July 2006, page 5. Video game A video game based on the show was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2007, developed by Brain in a Jar and published by Mastertronic Group under their budget game label Blast! Entertainment. It is a racing and action game akin to the Driver series. Much like the Hasbro toy line and Panini comic book series, the video game was released as Action Man: A.T.O.M. in certain territories. It would be the final video game to be associated with the Action Man franchise.

Although Alfred Wainwright listed it as one of the 214 featured hills in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells it was his least favourite. He commented that it \\"has no more pretension to elegance than a pudding that has been sat on\\".Wainwright, Alfred: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells,Book 5 The Northern Fells: There is some speculation that Wainwright included the fell in his guide simply as a way to fill space, but that has never been proven. Mungrisdale Common is oddly named, as it is a number of miles from the village of Mungrisdale, which lies in a different river catchment. Topography Mungrisdale Common lies north of Blencathra of which it is an outlier. Gently graded grassy slopes fall from Atkinson Pike, Blencathra's northern summit. Upon meeting the head of Blackhazel Beck, the shoulder divides in two, the northeastern arm connecting to Bannerdale Crags and the north western branch continuing to descend to Mungrisdale Common. Beyond an almost imperceptible depression the reascent is only 6 ft. After the brief plateau of the summit the descent continues westward toward Skiddaw Forest. Confusingly, the forest contains no trees other than the windbreak of Skiddaw House, but it is a marshy upland area, at around 400 m (roughly 1,300 ft), surrounded on all sides by higher fells. Three streams flow from Skiddaw Forest, dividing the Northern Fells into three sectors. Dash Beck runs north- west, the River Caldew north east and the Glenderaterra Beck south. The three ranges of the Northern Fells are the Skiddaw massif to the southwest, the Blencathra group including Mungrisdale Common to the south east and the area colloquially known as 'Back o'Skiddaw' to the north. Skiddaw House, the lone building in the forest, has variously seen service as a shepherds' bothy and a Youth Hostel. The Glenderaterra Beck lies to the west of Mungrisdale Common and its tributary, Roughten Gill, forms the southern boundary. A further feeder on this flank is Sinen Gill, whose waterfall is one of the fell's most notable features. The River Caldew lies to the north, across which is Great Calva, most southerly of the Back o'Skiddaw fells. Despite its uninspiring appearance Mungrisdale Common does therefore stand on the important Eden- Derwent watershed, though it is not well defined at this point. Water from the southern flanks reach the sea at Workington while rain falling on the northern side heads for the Solway Firth via Carlisle. The watershed continues across Skiddaw Forest between the headwaters of the Caldew and Glenderaterra, linking onward to Lonscale Fell in the Skiddaw range. Mungrisdale Common carries a very small cairn at the approximate summit, constructed only after Wainwright first encouraged climbing of the fell by including it in his 1962 guidebook. Two more prominent ancient cairns also grace the fell, one to the west of the summit and the other on a tongue of ground between Sinen Gill and Roughten Gill. A small stone pillar (marked 'stake' on OS maps) stands on the watershed at the head of Glenderaterra Beck and a further prominent Cloven Stone marks its continuation higher up the slope. Both have served as boundary stones. Geology In common with much of the Northern Fells, the Kirk Stile Formation of the Skiddaw Group predominates. It is composed of laminated mudstone and siltstone with greywacke sandstone and is of Ordovician age. Unusually however, it is overlain by considerable beds of peat in the vicinity of Mungrisdale Common.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) The Glenderaterra valley was the scene of some mining activity in the 19th century. The northern workings were first named Glenderaterra Mine and later Brundholme Mine. They were driven primarily for lead but also copper ore and baryte. The returns were never economic, which led to the mine being abandoned in 1920. A little to the south was Blencathra Mine, which was worked unsuccessfully until about 1880.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) Summit Wainwright's displeasure was not restricted to Mungrisdale Common's profile: he also remarked: \\"Any one of a thousand tufts of tough bent and cotton-grass might lay claim to crowning the highest point‚Ä¶ A thousand tufts, yet not one can be comfortably reclined upon, this being a summit that holds indefinitely all the water that falls upon it.\\" The view includes a striking window to the southwest between Lonscale Fell and Blencathra, revealing unexpectedly a run of high fells from Pillar to Crinkle Crags. Elsewhere, the view is of the nearby fells surrounding Skiddaw Forest. Ascents \\"For people who won't be told\\" Wainwright suggested ascents from Keswick or Threlkeld via the Glenderaterra valley. An alternative would be from Scales or Mungrisdale via the Glenderamackin col. Most ascents are likely to be as part of a climb of Blencathra, the intervening ground being gentle of gradient. Trivia Apart from the sub 1,000 ft Castle Crag, Mungrisdale Common is the only Wainwright not to feature in Bill Birkett's Complete Lakeland Fells.Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): References Category:Fells of the Lake District ","title":"Mungrisdale Common"},{"id":"3810625","text":"The Herbert Mountains () are a conspicuous group of rock summits on the east side of Gordon Glacier in the Shackleton Range of Antarctica.

Early life Hickox was born in Stokenchurch in Buckinghamshire into a musical family. After attending the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe from 1959 to 1966, he studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London from 1966 to 1967, then was an organ scholar at Queens' College, Cambridge from 1967 to 1970. Career In 1967, while his father was Vicar of Wooburn, Buckinghamshire, Hickox founded the Wooburn Festival and eventually became its president. The Festival still takes place and features music, drama and the visual arts. Hickox also founded the Wooburn Singers and continued as conductor until succeeded by Stephen Jackson. From 1970 to 1971 Hickox was Director of Music at Maidenhead Grammar School (later Desborough School). He founded the City of London Sinfonia in 1971, remaining music director until his death, and also founded the Richard Hickox Singers and Orchestra in the same year. The Richard Hickox Singers are featured on Kate Bush's album Hounds of Love on the song \\"Hello Earth\\"; The choral section is the Georgian folk song \\"Tsintskaro\\".Credited in EMI booklet, CDP7461642 He was the director of music at the St. Endellion Music Festival from 1972 to 2008. In 1972, aged 24, he was appointed Martin Neary's successor as organist and master of music at St. Margaret's, Westminster (the church of the Houses of Parliament), subsequently adding the directorships of the London Symphony Chorus (1976) and Bradford Festival Choral Society (1978). From 1982 to 1990, he served as Artistic Director of the Northern Sinfonia. He was Associate Guest Conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra from 1985 until his death. He was Chorus Director of the London Symphony Chorus from 1976 to 1991, with whom he premiered The Three Kings by Peter Maxwell Davies in 1995. He premiered A Dance on the Hill in 2005, by the same composer. His repertoire included over 100 first performances. In 1990, he co-founded the baroque orchestra Collegium Musicum 90 with Simon Standage. For five years, Hickox was Music Director of the Spoleto Festival, Italy. From 2000 to 2006, he was Principal Conductor of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, thereafter becoming its Conductor Emeritus. He became the Music Director of Opera Australia in 2005. In this role he conducted the Australian premieres of The Love for Three Oranges, Rusalka, and Arabella (which won 2008's prestigious Helpmann Award for Best Opera). He collaborated on new productions of The Tales of Hoffmann and Alcina. CD recordings of The Love for Three Oranges and Rusalka have been released by Chandos and received very positive reviews in the international and local press. Hickox also led major revivals, including Tannh√§user, Death in Venice, Giulio Cesare, Billy Budd, and Jan√°ƒçek's The Makropulos Affair. In recent years, the Australian opera singers Fiona Janes and Bruce Martin, formerly featured with Opera Australia, had left the organisation and criticised Hickox and Opera Australia for perceived declines in artistic standards since the start of Hickox's tenure. Hickox was contracted as Opera Australia's music director through to 2012 at the time of his death in November 2008. Hickox was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2002 Queen's Birthday Honours. His recording repertoire concentrated on British music, in which he made a number of recording premieres for Chandos Records (he made over 280 recordings for this company). In 1997 he won the Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording for his recording of Benjamin Britten's Peter Grimes. He garnered five Gramophone Awards: for recordings of Britten's War Requiem (1992); Frederick Delius's Sea Drift (1994); William Walton's Troilus and Cressida (1995); the original 1913 version of Ralph Vaughan Williams' A London Symphony (2001 Record of the Year and Best Orchestral Disc); and Charles Villiers Stanford's Songs of the Sea (2006 Editor's Choice). He made only the second recording of Delius's Requiem (1996). He was awarded a Doctorate of Music at Durham University in 2003; and was an Honorary Fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge. He received two Royal Philharmonic Society Music Awards, the first Sir Charles Groves Award, the Evening Standard Opera Award, and the Association of British Orchestras Award. He was also President of the Elgar Society. Death On 23 November 2008, during a recording session of Holst's First Choral Symphony for Chandos, Hickox was taken ill and died in Swansea from a dissecting thoracic aneurysm. He had been scheduled to conduct a new production of Vaughan Williams' Riders to the Sea at English National Opera later that month. A memorial service was held at Queens' College, Cambridge, on 26 November 2008, with music conducted by Sir David Willcocks. A service of Thanksgiving took place in St Paul's Cathedral, London on 12 March 2009.  Personal life  Hickox was married three times. In 1970 he married Julia Smith: the marriage was dissolved in 1976. His second marriage to Frances Sheldon-Williams produced a son, Tom Hickox. That marriage was also dissolved. His third marriage was to the contralto Pamela Helen Stephen with two children - Adam and Abigail. His widow and three children survive him. His son Adam became an assistant conductor in Rotterdam in 2019.

He was a member of Lord Palmerston's first administration as Paymaster-General and Vice-President of the Board of Trade in 1855 and as President of the Poor Law Board between 1855 and 1858. Background and education Pleydell-Bouverie was the second son of William Pleydell-Bouverie, 3rd Earl of Radnor, by his second wife, Anne Judith, third daughter of Sir Henry St John-Mildmay, 3rd Baronet.Dod (1860), p. 127 The family homes were at Longford Castle in Wiltshire and Coleshill House in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). Jacob Pleydell-Bouverie, 4th Earl of Radnor, was his elder brother. He was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating as a Master of Arts in 1838. He was a pr√©cis writer to Lord Palmerston from January to June 1840 before he was called to the Bar, Inner Temple, on 27 January 1843. Political career In 1844 Pleydell-Bouverie was returned to Parliament for Kilmarnock Burghs, a constituency he represented until 1874. He served as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department in Lord John Russell's first administration from July 1850 to March 1852, and from April 1853 to March 1855 he was Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons, while Lord Aberdeen was prime minister. In March 1855, when Lord Palmerston became premier, Pleydell-Bouverie was made Paymaster-General and Vice-President of the Board of Trade, and sworn of the Privy Council. In August of the same year he was transferred to the Presidency of the Poor Law Board, a position he held until 1858. However, he was never a member of the cabinet. In 1857 he was appointed one of the committee of the Council on Education. He was Second Church Estate Commissioner from August 1859 to November 1865, and from 1869 he was one of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England. Though a staunch liberal, Pleydell-Bouverie belonged to the old whig school, and during his last years in parliament often found himself in disagreement with the policies of Liberal prime minister, William Ewart Gladstone. In 1872, when a charge of evasion of the law was made against Gladstone in connection with the appointment he made to the rectory of Ewelme, Pleydell-Bouverie expressed regret \\"We all have our amusements at various times, but that of the right hon. Gentleman, when he has nothing else to do, is to drive coaches and six through Acts of Parliament\\". When the Irish University Bill was introduced in March, Pleydell-Bouverie finally broke with Gladstone. He denounced the measure as miserably bad and scandalously inadequate to its professed object. He voted against the second reading on 10 March, when the government was defeated. Subsequently, in letters addressed to The Times he continued his attacks on the measure and on its framers. After his retirement from parliament in 1874, Pleydell-Bouverie became in 1877 associated with the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders, and was soon made its chairman. Under his guidance the debts of many countries were readjusted, and the corporation's scheme for dealing with the Turkish debt was confirmed by the sultan's irad√© of January 1882. Bouverie was Deputy Chairman of the Mersey Railway at its opening in 1886. He was also director of the Great Western Railway Company and of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. He addressed numerous letters to The Times newspaper under the signature of \\"E. P. B.\\" He was appointed High Sheriff of Wiltshire for 1882‚Äì83. Family Pleydell-Bouverie married Elizabeth Anne, youngest daughter of General Robert Balfour of Balbirnie, Fife, on 1 November 1842. They lived at Market Lavington Manor in Wiltshire and had two sons, Walter (5 July 1848 ‚Äì 20 May 1893), a captain in the 2nd Wiltshire Rifle Volunteers, and Edward Oliver (12 December 1856 ‚Äì 13 May 1938), and three daughters. One, Eglantine, married Augustus Keppel Stephenson, Director of Public Prosecutions from 1884 to 1894. Elizabeth Anne died in August 1889. Pleydell-Bouverie only survived her by four months and died at 44 Wilton Crescent, London, on 16 December 1889, aged 71.

County Court judgments (CCJs) are legal decisions handed down by the County Court.gov.uk Web site: County court judgments for debt, Overview Judgments for monetary sums are entered on the statutory Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines,Web site of Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines which is checked by credit reference agencies to assess the credit-worthiness of individuals. An alleged debtor is sent postal notification of an impending County Court case, and has fourteen days to respond, by paying the money, admitting owing a smaller sum, denying owing it, or going to a court hearing.gov.uk Web site: Respond to a court claim for money If there is no response judgement will be granted against the debtor. If the debtor does not make payment in response to a CCJ, the creditor may apply for a charging order, which would secure the debt on a property. Creditors can also apply for an attachment of earnings which would oblige the debtor's employer to deduct monies from their salary and send them to the court. A third-party debt order would oblige a third party who holds money belonging to the debtor (for example a bank) to pay the debt. It is also possible to have the court appoint a County Court bailiff to collect the debt. A bailiff is an official of the court who has some powers to seize goods and sell them at auction to settle a debt. Impact on credit reference agency information Once a CCJ has been entered, if not paid in full within thirty days it is kept on record for six years by the register and credit reference agencies (CRAs); there is no way to expunge the record of a correctly granted CCJ, although later payment will be recorded. The record is removed after six years. The Office of Fair Trading warned about credit repair companies that offer, for a fee, quick-fix schemes purported to remove a file from the CCJ register. In some cases a CCJ is made against someone who did not receive the notification of the court case, often due to it being sent to an incorrect or former address, and is not aware of the judgement; this may lead to unexpected refusal of credit. Checking of the Register or CRA records will find such cases. The records can be checked by anybody on payment of a small fee. When a person applies for credit or finance, potential creditors normally check CRA records, refusing applicants considered to have a bad credit history; a CCJ on record makes it much more difficult to obtain finance through the normal channels. Some lenders will lend to people with CCJs against them, but usually on unfavourable terms, e.g. through a very expensive payday loan. Mitigation If regular payments to the court are being made this is recorded on the credit file in addition to the record of the CCJ, and goes some way to lessen the negative credit rating impact. Once the full amount owed is repaid the CCJ is marked as 'satisfied', but remains on file. The record of a CCJ which is satisfied within one month can be removed altogether on application to the Register (and hence the CRAs).CCJ's explained: How to avoid years of inconvenience Other legislation The Reporting on Payment Practices and Performance Regulations 2017, came into force on 6th April 2017.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/395/made Under the rules introduced in April 2017, all large UK companies are required to publish specific information regarding their payment policies, practices and performance ‚Äî including the average time taken to pay supplier invoices ‚Äî twice yearly.

Early years Little is known about Read's early life. She was born around 1708, most likely in Birmingham, England (Some sources state she was born in Philadelphia) to John and Sarah Read, a well respected Quaker couple. John Read was a moderately prosperous building contractor and carpenter who died in 1724. Read had three siblings: two brothers, John and James, and a sister, Frances. The Read family immigrated to English America in 1711, settling in Philadelphia. Marriages In October 1723, Read met then 17-year-old Benjamin Franklin when he walked past the Read home on Market Street one morning. Franklin had just moved to Philadelphia from Boston to find employment as a printer. In his autobiography, Franklin recalled that at the time of their meeting, he was walking while carrying \\"three great puffy rolls\\". As he had no pockets, Franklin carried one roll under each arm and was eating the third. Read (whom Franklin called \\"Debby\\") was standing in the doorway of her home and was amused by the sight of Franklin's \\"most awkward ridiculous appearance.\\" A romance between Read and Franklin soon developed. When Franklin was unable to find appropriate living accommodations near his job, Read's father allowed him to rent a room in the family home. Read and Franklin's courtship continued, and in 1724, Franklin proposed marriage. However, Read's mother, Mary, would not consent to the marriage, citing Franklin's pending trip to London and financial instability. Read and Franklin postponed their marriage plans and Franklin traveled to England. Upon arriving in London, Franklin decided to end the relationship. In a terse letter, he informed Read that he had no intention of returning to Philadelphia. Franklin subsequently became stranded in London after Sir William Keith failed to follow through on promises of financial support. In Franklin's absence, Read was persuaded by her mother to marry John Rogers, a British man who has been identified variously as a carpenter or a potter. Read eventually agreed and married Rogers on August 5, 1725 at Christ Church, Philadelphia. The marriage quickly fell apart as the \\"sweet-talking\\" Rogers could not hold a job and had incurred a large amount of debt before their marriage. Four months after they were married, Read left Rogers after a friend of Rogers‚Äô visiting from England informed her that Rogers had a wife in his native England. Read refused to live with or recognize Rogers as her husband. While the couple were separated, Rogers spent Read's dowry, incurred more debt, and used the marriage to further his own schemes. In December 1727, Rogers stole a slave and disappeared. Soon afterward, unconfirmed reports circulated that Rogers had made his way to the British West Indies, where he was killed in a fight. In his autobiography, Franklin also claimed that Rogers died in the British West Indies. John Rogers' true fate has never been proven. Despite his previous intention to remain in London, Franklin returned to Philadelphia in October 1727. He and Read eventually resumed their relationship and decided to marry. While Read considered her marriage to her first husband to be over, she was not able to legally remarry. At that time, the law in the Province of Pennsylvania would not grant a divorce on the grounds of desertion. She could neither claim to be a widow, as there was no proof that Rogers was dead. If Rogers returned after Read legally married Franklin, she faced a charge of bigamy which carried the penalty of thirty nine lashings on the bare back and life imprisonment with hard labor. To avoid any legal issues, Read and Franklin decided upon a common-law marriage. On September 1, 1730, the couple held a ceremony for friends and family in which they announced they would live as husband and wife. They had two children together: Francis Folger \\"Franky\\" (born 1732), who died of smallpox in 1736 at the age of four, and Sarah \\"Sally\\" (born 1743). Read also helped to raise Franklin's illegitimate son William, whose mother's identity is unknown. Later years and death By the late 1750s, Benjamin Franklin had established himself as a successful printer, publisher, and writer. He was appointed the first postmaster of Philadelphia and was heavily involved in social and political affairs that would eventually lead to the establishment of the United States. In 1757, Franklin embarked on the first of numerous trips to Europe. Read refused to accompany him due to a fear of ocean travel. While Franklin stayed overseas for the next five years, Read remained in Philadelphia where, despite her limited education, she successfully ran her husband's businesses, maintained their home, cared for the couple's children and regularly attended Quaker Meeting. Franklin returned to Philadelphia in November 1762. He tried to persuade Read to accompany him to Europe, but she again refused. Franklin returned to Europe in November 1764 where he would remain for the next ten years. Read would never see Franklin again. In 1768, Read suffered the first of a series of strokes that severely impaired her speech and memory. For the remainder of her life, she suffered from poor health and depression. Despite his wife's condition, Franklin did not return to Philadelphia even though he had completed his diplomatic duties. In November 1769, Read wrote Franklin saying that her stroke, declining health and depressed mental state were a result of her \\"dissatisfied distress\\" due to his prolonged absence. Franklin still did not return but continued to write to Read. Read's final surviving letter to Franklin is dated October 29, 1773. Thereafter, she stopped corresponding with her husband. Franklin continued to write to Read, inquiring as to why her letters had ceased, but still did not return home. On December 14, 1774, Read suffered a final stroke and died on December 19. She was buried at Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia. Franklin was buried next to her upon his death in 1790.

The tremissis or tremis (Greek: œÑœÅŒπŒºŒØœÉŒπŒøŒΩ, trimision) was a small solid gold coin of Late Antiquity. Its name, meaning \\"a third of a unit\\", formed by analogy with semissis (half of a unit), indicated its value relative to the solidus. It was introduced into Roman currency in the 380s by the Emperor Theodosius I and initially weighed 8 siliquae (equivalent to 1.52 grams).Philip Grierson, \\"Tremissis\\", in Alexander Kazhdan, ed., The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium (Oxford University Press, 1991 [online 2005]), vol. 3, p. 2113. Roman tremisses continued to be commonly minted into the reign of Leo III (717‚Äì741), but thereafter they were only rarely struck in the east of the empire, probably only for ceremonial uses, until the reign of Basil I (867‚Äì886), after which they disappeared. Nevertheless, the coin continued in common use in the Sicilian theme until the fall of Syracuse in 878. The trachy, introduced in the 11th century, was equivalent in value to the old tremissis. Although it was not made of gold, it was one third of the standard golden hyperpyron. It was not, however, called tremissis. Outside of the Roman empire, tremisses were minted by the Anglo-Saxons, Burgundians, Franks, Frisians, Lombards, Ostrogoths, Suevi and Visigoths between the 5th and 8th centuries.\\"Tremissis\\", in Robert E. Bjork, ed., The Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages (Oxford University Press, 2010). The word tremissis was borrowed into Old English as thrymsa.\\"Thrymsas\\", in Robert E. Bjork, ed., The Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages (Oxford University Press, 2010). In Frankish sources, the tremissis is sometimes called a triens, a term likewise meaning \\"a third\\", which originally referred to a bronze coin worth a third of an as. The historian and bishop Gregory of Tours calls the Frankish tremissis a trians or treans. The German form dremise is also attested. In French historiography the term tiers (third) or tiers de sou (third of a solidus) is often used. The French, in general, prefer to call the coin of the Merovingian kings a triens (but avoiding the plural form trientes), while British scholarship prefers tremissis.Philip Grierson and Mark Blackburn, Medieval European Coinage: Volume 1, The Early Middle Ages (5th‚Äì10th Centuries) (Cambridge University Press, 1986), p. 102.

Taylor was educated at Stockport Secondary School. He was first elected as a Conservative councillor to Sutton and Cheam Borough Council in 1951. In 1962 he was elected an Alderman, and he was elected for Cheam South ward to Sutton Borough Council from the creation of the council in 1964 until 1968. He was an Alderman of Sutton from 1968 until the abolition of the Aldermanic system in 1978. He then returned to his old ward for a final term from 1978 to 1982. Having previously served as Leader of Sutton Borough Council and Chairman of the London Boroughs Association (1968-1971), from 1978 to 1980 Taylor was Chairman of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, ending his term with a knighthood.‚ÄòTAYLOR, Sir (Arthur) Godfrey‚Äô, Who's Who 2010, A & C Black, 2010; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2009 ; online edn, Nov 2009. The Conservative government appointed Taylor as Chairman of the Southern Water Authority in 1981 for a four-year term. As this term was coming to an end, he was picked to head up the London Residuary Body. His close connections with the Conservative Party were regarded with cynicism by opponents of the abolition of the GLC, which had been controlled by a left-wing Labour administration in its last five years. However, the LRB had very few powers beyond selling off and dismantling the GLC, and when he took charge he was not a prominent figure. The most controversial decision of the LRB, to sell off the GLC's offices at County Hall to a Japanese corporation rather than the London School of Economics, was taken when Taylor was very little known to the public. Taylor was reappointed chairman several times. As the LRB progressively sold off assets, its work reduced and from 1 December 1992 his time commitment reduced from 5 days a week to one. He continued until the LRB had completed its work and was wound up in 1996. An academic study of its work, \\"The Dismantlers\\", gave general praise for the work it had done, but members of the old GLC regarded its purpose as being fundamentally destructive.Michael Hebbert, \\"The Dismantlers\\", Suntory-Toyota International Centre for Economics and Related Disciplines, 1994 (Occasional Paper 18), .

The daughter of the 6th Baron Ferrers of Chartley, Anne, married Walter Devereux who was summoned to parliament as Lord Ferrers in her right. Their descendants became Earls of Essex and the peerage was forfeited in 1601 on the attainder of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, but restored to his son Robert in 1604, on whose death in 1646 the peerage fell into abeyance. The abeyance was terminated in 1677 when Robert Shirley, a grandson of one of the sisters of the 3rd Earl of Essex, was summoned as Lord Ferrers of Chartley with precedence to the original creation. In 1711, Shirley was created the 1st Earl Ferrers, but the Earldom and Barony separated at his death, the barony going to Elizabeth Shirley, the daughter of his eldest son, while the earldom went to his second son. On the 1741 death of Elizabeth Shirley, 15th Baroness Ferrers of Chartley and wife of the Earl of Northampton, the peerage again briefly fell into an abeyance that was resolved in 1749 by the death of two of the three heiresses, leaving the surviving daughter, Charlotte Compton, wife of the Marquess Townshend, as 16th Baroness Ferrers of Chartley. The barony continued, merged with the marquessate, until the death of George Ferrars Townshend, 3rd Marquess Townshend in 1855, when it again fell into abeyance between his two sisters and their heirs. It remains in abeyance. Origins of the Ferrers of Chartley family Arms of Ferrers of Chartley: Vairy, or and gules The Lords Ferrers of Chartley descended Henry de Ferrers, of Ferri√®res-Saint-Hilaire in Normandy, who participated in the Norman Conquest of England, and was richly rewarded by King William the Conqueror with the grant of 210 manors throughout England and Wales, situated mainly in Derbyshire and Leicestershire. His son Robert de Ferrers was named Earl of Derby, and this title continued in the family until Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby was attainted in 1267 for his participation in the Second Barons' War against king Henry III. Draconian terms were set for the reacquisition of his lands, and he was only able to have the manor of Chartley, Staffordshire, restored to him, in 1275. John de Ferrers, son and heir of the former 6th Earl, would continue his father's struggle for restoration of family lands until barred from pursuing it further by Edward I in 1301. He was summoned in 1298/9 to Parliament, thereby becoming the first Baron Ferrers of Chartley.

It is composed of Christians and Jews working together to counter anti-semitism and other forms of intolerance in Britain. Their patron is Queen Elizabeth II. The CCJ was founded, in 1942, by Chief Rabbi Joseph H. Hertz and Archbishop William Temple during a time of all-out warfare and Nazi persecution of Jews. In late 1954, and reflecting the theology of the era, the Vatican instructed the head of English Catholics to resign from the CCJ due to its perceived indifferentism, with Catholics not returning until the reforms introduced by the Second Vatican Council.\\"History: Council of Christians and Jews\\", CCJ Web site, retrieved 15 June 2009  Background  Prior to the foundation of the Council of Christians and Jews a number of initiatives had already taken place. The London Society for the Study of Religions, founded in 1904, included Jews in its membership.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p. 1 In 1924 the Presbyterian Church of England General Assembly agreed to form a sub committee to discuss the lack of understanding between Jews and Christians. The committee wished to abandon proselytising and instead promote cooperative methods of action.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p.2 In 1925 Herbert Lowe, a Jewish Cambridge scholar, addressed the General Assembly for the first time. :\\"The love of God and love of man are the foundations of our faith and of yours. We have a vast heritage in common...We recognise that we are put on earth to serve each other...When we consider the framework on which our creeds are built the wonder is not that our views of life are similar, but that we should have been so long in discovering the similarity, the wonder is that centuries of ignorance and hatred should have intervened between us..I am convinced that our partnership in the fight against oppression and injustice and race-hatred can be successful, and our efforts can never be blessed until we learn to respect the standpoint of each other.\\"A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p. 3 In 1924 the Social Service Committee of the Liberal Jewish Synagogue convened a meeting for Jews and Christians to confer together on the basis of their common ideals and with mutual respect for differences of belief'. From this developed the Society of Jews and Christians in 1927 that provided a platform for a number of notable speakers.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p. 3 The inter war years was marked by a reappraisal by Christian scholars of Jewish religion. In 1930 James Parkes published 'The Jew and his neighbour', setting out the causes of anti-Semitism and its Christian roots.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p4 Parkes would later be placed on Hitler's list of those he wanted killed.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p. 4 With the rise of Nazi anti-Semitism a few Christians did speak out. In 1934 The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland noted the 'age-long sufferings of the Jewish people' and that during 'the present outbreaks of anti-Semitic fanaticism', declared its 'heart-felt sympathy for the Jewish people' and deplored their present treatment as being 'abhorrent'.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p.6 A Youth Council on Jewish-Christian Relations was formed in 1934 that included several Christian organisations and by 1940 also included Jewish groups. By the middle of the decade various groups made up of Jews and Christians were involved in giving aid to Jewish refugees from Germany, whose number rose sharply after Kristallnacht. The Refugee Children's Movement took care to ensure that whenever a Jewish child was placed in a Christian home the child would not be subject to proselytisation and that contact was established with the nearest Rabbi.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, pp. 6-7 Anglican, Free church and Roman Catholic Churches came together in 1938 to form a Christian Council for Refugees following the passing of the Nuremberg Decrees.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p. 7 The council's secretary was W. W. Simpson, a Methodist minister, who would dedicate his life to the improvement of Christian-Jewish relations. His 1939 pamphlet 'The Christian and the Jewish Problem' recognised the part of Christianity in Jewish suffering, involving factors such deicide, the Crusades, the ghettos, the Inquisition and their influence on present day persecution.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p.9  Formation  Out of the diverse groups that marked Jewish- Christian dialogue and aid during the 1930s a proposal was circulated with a view to forming an organization built on a national network. The Archbishop of York, William Temple, invited leaders of various communities to discuss these proposals in 1941. Temple outlined the mission of what was to become the Council of Christians and Jews. The Council would work against all forms of discrimination and promote the 'fundamental ethical teachings which are common to Judaism and Christianity' The Chief Rabbi, Dr. Hertz, agreed with this approach and highlighted the central point as being 'the danger to civilisation involved in antisemitism, as well as the steps that might be taken by Christians, working in consultation with Jews, to prevent its spread in this country', noting also how Pius XI had recently affirmed that 'Anti- semitism is a movement in which we Christians can have no part whatsoever. Spiritually we are Semites'.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, pp. 11-12 Hertz made it clear that Jews and Christians would be responsible for their own religious teaching without mutual interference.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p.12 At a meeting chaired by William Temple, now the nominated Archbishop of Canterbury, on 20 March 1942 the formation of the Council of Christians and Jews was agreed. The aims of the council were specified as: *(a) To check and combat religious and racial intolerance. *(b) To promote mutual understanding and goodwill between Christians and Jews in all sections of the community, especially in connection with problems arising from conditions created by the war. *(c) To promote fellowship between Christian and Jewish youth organisations in educational and cultural activities. *(d) To foster co-operation of Christians and Jews in study and service directed to post-war reconstruction.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p.14 The initial membership of the CCJ was composed of leaders of Christian and Jewish organisations. The Roman Catholic prelate, Cardinal Hinsley, agreed to be a Joint President subject to the condition that any statements be approved by him prior to publication. The formation of the CCJ was announced on radio and in the press on 1 October 1942.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p. 17  Early years  The CCJ was formed at a time of Nazi persecution of Jews but the full scale of the extermination process, and the response of organisations such as the CCJ, was to an extent governed by the amount of factual information then available in the public domain.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p. 20 In 1942 deputations were sent to the Foreign Office and Anthony Eden regarding the accounts then emerging about the Nazi extermination process, followed by a letter published in The Times on 5 December speaking of a 'horror beyond what imagination can grasp...burning indignation at this atrocity, to which the records of barbarous ages scarcely provide a parallel.\\" The letter criticised the delays in officialdom, branding their excuses as having an 'air of irrelevance', and called for the prosecution of those involved in the extermination process after the war.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p21 Temple, at the behest of the CCJ, made a broadcast to the Hungarian people using the BBC World Service and appealed: : \\"do your utmost to save from persecution, it may be from massacre, those who are now threatened as a result of German occupation...Help them to hide from their tormentors, help them, if possible, to escape. Do all you can to prevent the extermination of people whose only fault is the race from which they are born or the independence of their minds and constancy of their convictions\\".A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p. 22 Some political voices raised concerns that such protestations could make things worse for the Jews but by early 1943 it had already become clear that nothing could be worse than what the Jews were currently suffering.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p. 22 Archbishop Temple addressed the House of Lords in March 1943 in which he referenced the massacre of Jews taking place, urging all means of action and condemned the procrastination of officialdom. He concluded: \\"We at this moment have upon us a tremendous responsibility. We stand at the bar of history, of humanity, and of God.\\"A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p. 23 In November 1943 the Council issued the first of its \\"Occasional Reviews\\" which contained a statement by the Archbishop of Canterbury on the \\"Basis of Co-operation between Jews and Christians.\\" and a response by the Chief Rabbi on the Jewish attitude to the Five Peace Points of Pope Pius XII.Christians and Jews AN \\" OCCASIONAL REVIEW\\", Catholic Herald, 19 November 1943, p. 5 In June 1944 the Council published a declaration affirming that \\"the moral law must govern world order \\" followed by six related principles.The Council said: \\"The significance of the afocument lies in the fact that it is the first statement of its kind to be published in this country with the approval of the heads of the Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish communities and on behalf of a representative hody of Christians end Jews.\\" It was also announced that Catholic Archbishop Griffin had become a Joint President of the Council in succession to the late Cardinal Hinsley.\\"JEWS AND CHRISTIANS Issue a Significant Document\\", Catholic Herald, 9 June 1944, p. 6 At 1944 annual general meeting of the Council Bishop Mathews described anti-Semitism as a type of \\"category dislikes\\": \\"Dislike by category is always evil. always unjustified, whether the category is the Jewish people, the negroes in the United States, or the Roman Catholics or any other body. I have an example fairly close home in the feeling of widespread indignation rooted in the population of Northern Ireland with regard to Roman Catholics. The first thing to be said about such dislike by category is that though it is evil in itself it attacks wide sections of the population. It becomes a mass instinct added to local patriotsm.\\"Category Dislikes, Catholic Herald, 23 June 1944, p. 1 In November 1944 the Catholic Archbishop of Westminster gave an address to the Council of Christians and Jews: :I should like to tell you, something of what the present Holy Father and the Vatican authorities have done to alleviate the suffering and the persecution of the Jews in many lands. There are thousands of Jews who owe their lives to the speedy intervention of the Pope when they were on the point of being massacred. Towards the end of June I was asked by the World Jewish Congress to support their appeal to the Holy Father to intervene on behalf of Hungarian Jews and it may interest you to hear the reply I received from the late Cardinal Secretary of State: \\"reference your telegram July 3 I beg to assure Your Excellency Holy See even through Papal Nunciature Budapest has left nothing undone and is still doing everything possible to alleviate sorrowful plight all those who are suffering on account of nationality or race.\\" The Archbishop proposed points for future cooperation: :Firstly by a common pledge to observe the laws of God and to fulfil Our duties to Him and to our fellow-men. Secondly. by urging the recognition on the part of all States, of the liberties and rights of man and by a clear acknowledgment of man's personal dignity, irrespective of race, creed Or Colour. Thirdly, by a deepening of the mutual understanding between Christians and Jews of our respective ideals and difficulties. And fourthly, by a solemn promise to protect effectively those who may be oppressed or persecuted for race. nationality, or creed.\\"Co-operation between Christians and Jews urged by Dr. Griffin\\", Catholic herald, 10 November 1944 Braybook (1991) notes that \\"Much is said of the silence of the Churches, which was often all too evident\\" but he picks out Temple, and the leaders of the various Churches who supported him, as an outspoken critic on this issue. The World Jewish Congress spoke of him as \\"the champion of the Jews\\".A History of the Council of Christians and Jews,p. 23 At a meeting of the CCJ held on the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht in 1988 Dr. Robert Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury acknowledged that the roots of these events lay in the preceding centuries of Christian anti-Semitism: :'Without centuries of Christian anti- Semitism, Hitlers passionate hatred would never have been so passionately echoed....The travesty of Kristallnacht and all that followed is that so much was perpetrated in Christ's name. To glorify the Third Reich, the Christian faith was betrayed. We cannot say, \\"We did not know\\", We did - and stood by.. And even today there are many Christians who fail to see it as self evident and why this blindness? Because for centuries Christians have held Jews collectively responsible for the death of Jesus. On Good Friday Jews have, in times past, cowered behind locked doors for fear of a Christian mob seeking 'revenge' for deicide. Without the poisoning of Christian minds through the centuries, the holocaust is unthinkable'.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews,pp. 83, 181  International Council of Christians and Jews  During the blitz of 1942 some British Christians and Jews met with members of the American National Conference of Christians and Jews (NCCJ) who were visiting London. It was agreed that after the war an international conference should be held for all the bodies who were active in the field of Christian-Jewish relationships.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p.118 The American group had not been formed to counterattacks on Jews, as was the case in London, but rather through anti-Catholicism agitation stirred up by the Ku Klux Klan at the time when Catholic Al Smith was standing for president. Jewish and Protestant leaders in the United States reacted and this led Catholics to join them in solidarity.\\"Christians and Jews(2)\\" Christopher Howse, The Tablet, 27 April 1985, p.8 The conference was held in Oxford in 1946 and over one hundred delegates from fifteen countries attended.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p.119 A public meeting held on the eve of the conference included as guest speakers the Archbishop of Canterbury, Reinhold Niebuhr, R. A. Butler and Rabbi Leo Baeck, a survivor of Theresienstadt concentration camp.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p.119 Various commissions were set up, a resolution was sent to the Paris Peace Conference, an agreement reached to hold an emergency conference dealing with anti-Semitism in Europe, and that a committee should research the possibility of forming an International Council of Christians and Jews which would bring together all the various national bodies.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p. 119 Jacques Maritain was elected to serve as co-Chairman with Dr. MacCracken of U.S.A. and the Marquess of Reading on the board of the proposed International Council of Christians and Jews.\\"Praise for Work of Jesuit on Council of Jews and Christians\\", Catholic Herald, PAGE 6, 14TH NOVEMBER 1947 An emergency conference took place in Seelisberg Switzerland in 1947. \\"The Ten Points of Seelisberg\\" agreed at the conference became a reference for many future statements by various Churches regarding new approaches to Judaism.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p.119 Pere de Lopinit who had worked in Italian camps in which Jews had been interred during the war took the document back to the Vatican and a form of nihil obstat was received. Cardinal Griffiths was dismissive of the plan but in time the ten points may have been a formative influence in the declaration on religious liberty of Vatican II (Nostra aetate)Christians and Jews Christopher Howse, The Tablet, 27 April 1985, p.8 The plan for an International Council of Christians and Jews did not come to fruition until 1974 due to differences regarding how it should be implemented .A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p.120, 121 British, French German and Swiss representatives agreed a constitution for the proposed International Council in 1948 but the American NCCJ didn't as it felt that the use of \\"Christian\\" in the organisations title would be a barrier to some people through the use of the word by some European political parties in their titles. Everett Clinchy of the NCCJ now directed his efforts into the \\"World Brotherhood\\" and the plans for an International Council for Christians and Jews were stalled.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews,pp. 119-120 Enthusiasm for an international organization was also limited through fears of religious indifferentism from a Roman Catholic perspective and a lack of sympathy to interfaith understanding in the prevailing Protestant theological climate.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p. 120 In the early 1950s a directive was sent to all national Catholic hierarchies from the Vatican warning against involvement in the International Council of Christians and Jews for fear that it was tending towards religious indifferentism - see following section. Cardinal Griffin asked if it also applied to the British Council and two years later the Vatican advised that it did and all Catholic members were told to withdraw. It did not happen anywhere else and William Simpson was of the opinion that if Cardinal Griffiths had not asked the question there would have been no trouble.Christians and Jews Christopher Howse, The Tablet, 27 April 1985, p.8 An International Consultative Committee of Organizations for Christian-Jewish Cooperation was finally established, without NCCJ participation, in January 1962 at a meeting in Frankfurt.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews,pp. 120-121 They held a conference in 1966 which issued a critique of the Vatican II Declaration Nostra aetate, the WCC's New Delhi statement on Christian-Jewish relations and a definition of dialogue: : The dialogue is essentially a dialogue between persons, an attitude to life and not a mere technique. It is a relationship which has been found in experience to be capable of deepening the spiritual life of all the participants alike, for each is given in dialogue full opportunity to express his position in all freedom. It has proved and enrichment of their faith in God to committed Jews and Christians, and has dispelled many misunderstandings of each about the faith and practice of the other. We believe that it is not only consistent with our several loyalties to Church and Synagogue, but that it also increases interreligious harmony as we face together the problems and needs of our changing world.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p. 121-22 In 1974 the NCCJ did join and at their suggestion the name of the organisation was changed to the International Council of Christians and Jews (ICCJ).A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p. 122 In 1975 the ICCJ met in Hamburg and such conferences developed into an annual event focussed on certain themes such as \\"When Religion is Used as a Weapon ...The Use and Misuse of Religion in Defence of National and Fundamental Values\\" (1991)A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p. 122 The first international youth conference was hosted by the CCJ in Wales in 1977.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p. 123  Relations with the Roman Catholic Church  See also Pope Pius XII and Judaism During the pontificate of Pope Pius XII \\"a heavy blow fell on the Council\\" when in November 1954 Cardinal Griffin announced that the Roman Catholic Church would be withdrawing from the CCJ following an instruction received from the Vatican indicating that the educational work being done by the council could result in religious indifferentism. Leading Roman Catholics resigned from the CCJ in the aftermath.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p.33 The Catholic Herald reported in December 1954: :It has now been publicly announced that the Holy See has instructed Catholics to relinquish their membership of the Council of Christians and Jews. Cardinal Griffin, one of the presidents. Lord Perth, a joint treasurer. and Lord Pekenham resigned some time ago. Discussions have been going on for a considerable time \\"in the hope\\" says The Times, \\"of finding a way to restore the united outlook on those matters of common concern for which the council have stood since they were set up in 1942. The council's aim was to combat religious and racial intolerance. promote understanding and good will between Christians and Jews and to foster co-operation.Catholics Resign, Catholic Herald, 31 December 1954, p. 1 The popular press was highly critical of this development with headlines such as \\"The Pope bans Queen's Council\\" and criticising Roman Catholic intolerance.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p.35 The Catholic periodical \\"The Tablet\\" expressed the view that the public resignations ought to have been avoided, further discussions held, and that the Vatican should have made the reasons for the withdrawal explicit.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p.35 The reasons for the withdrawal were never clearly explained, however Roman Catholic theologian Jacques Maritain had previously warned the CCJ that Rome was suspicious of any cooperative ventures between Jews, Protestants and Catholics.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p.36 A Church source commented: \\"From the Roman Catholic side there was no failure to appreciate the aims and objects to promote which this council exists, but the Vatican was not satisfied with some of the ways and means adopted by the council in pursuit of those aims.\\"\\"Council of Christians and Jews\\", Catholic Herald, 18 March 1955, p.1 During the pontificate of Pope John XXIII Catholics were once again permitted to join the CCJ, including notable figures such as Lord Longford and Lord Perth.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p.38 In 1962 the Earl of Perth and two Catholic laymen served on the Council with ecclesiastical approval. In 1964 Archbishop Heenan addressed the CCJ and expressed the opinion that the original withdrawal from the Council was due to a misunderstanding in Rome.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p.39 The Archbishop said many people, had been \\"disappointed even scandalised\\" by the original decision and that it was \\"possible and even probable that the Vatican was misinformed,\\"Christians and Jews, The Tablet, 14 March 1964, p. 21 In June 1964 Archbishop Heenan accepted the invitation to become a joint president of the Council with the Catholic Herald commenting \\"By so doing, the break which has lasted ten years between the Council and the Catholic Church has been fully mended.\\"Ten year rift is healed by Dr. Heenan, Catholic Herald, 19 June 1964, p.3 The Council's other four presidents were the Chief Rabbi, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and the Moderator of the Free Church Federal Council.\\"The Church in the World\\", The Tablet, 20 June 1964, p.24] The early difficulties associated with Roman Catholic membership largely disappeared in the aftermath of the issuing of Nostra aetate by the Second Vatican Council.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p.40 In 1980 and 1990 Pope John Paul II met delegations from the CCJ and conferred a knighthood on Sir Sigmund Sternberg who was joint treasurer of the CCJ and chairman of the International Council of Christians and Jews.A History of the Council of Christians and Jews, p.41  Later years  The CCJ established The Robert Waley Cohen Memorial Lectureship in 1956 as a tribute to Robert Waley Cohen and his service to the Council.

But the approach the author has chosen and his very conscientiousness are both a strength and a weakness. Some of the material makes compelling reading, but there are pages which, inevitably, are of interest primarily to the specialist.Church and synagogue, The Tablet, 7 March 1992, p.18 The Catholic Herald in its review commented: :To members of the council, this book will be a most helpful account of the origins and history of the movement which has held them enthralled ever since they joined it. To others it will be an eye opener, but regrettably there will be many Christians and Jews who will still not want to know in case their prejudices are disturbed. The author has written a factual account of the growth of the Council of Christians and Jews from its birth in 1941 up to the present.

Crying The Neck is a harvest festival tradition once common in counties of Devon and Cornwall in the United Kingdom in Europe. The tradition declined following the invention of machines such as the combine harvester. The tradition is no longer known to be practised in Devon. In Cornwall, however, the tradition was revived in the early twentieth century by the Old Cornwall Society.http://newquayoldcornwall.org.uk/articles/crying_the_neck.php Ceremony In The Story of Cornwall, by Kenneth Hamilton Jenkin, the following explanation is given on the practice: :\\"In those days the whole of the reaping had to be done either with the hook or scythe. The harvest, in consequence, often lasted for many weeks. When the time came to cut the last handful of standing corn, one of the reapers would lift up the bunch high above his head and call out in a loud voice....., :\\"I 'ave 'un! I 'ave 'un! I 'ave 'un!\\" The rest would then shout, :\\"What 'ave 'ee? What 'ave 'ee? What 'ave 'ee?\\" and the reply would be: :\\"A neck! A neck! A neck!\\" Everyone then joined in shouting: :\\"Hurrah! Hurrah for the neck! Hurrah for Mr. So-and-So\\" (calling the farmer by name.)\\" Robert Hunt wrote in his Popular Romances of the West of England that the neck would be hung in the farmhouse after the ceremony. Modern popular culture In a harvest scene in the third episode of the second series of the 2015 of Poldark, Francis Poldark performs the tradition at Trenwith, his estate. In a harvest scene in the third episode of supernatural drama The Living and the Dead (S01 E03), Charlotte Appleby performs the tradition at her husband's family farm, which she manages.http://www.armchairanglophile.com/living-dead-episode-3-recap/  See also  *Harvest festival *Guldize ReferencesExternal links *The custom as described in 1836 by W.

This building burned down in 1947 The First Presbyterian Church and Cemetery in New Brunswick, New Jersey is one of the oldest churches in the Presbyterian denomination.

History In 1738 the Presbytery of East Jersey was merged with the Presbytery of Long Island and renamed the Presbytery of New York, and two days after that, the Presbytery of New Brunswick was created. In late 1726, or early 1727 Reverend Gilbert Tennent was ordained pastor of the congregation. The church records were destroyed or lost, during the American revolution when British soldiers were quartered in the manse. The records of the First Presbyterian Church (Newark, New Jersey) were destroyed at the same time. Because of damage to the church from the war, a new building was set up to replace the damaged one. In 1937 John Gresham Machen was condemned by the Presbytery of New Brunswick for disobeying higher authorities in a religious court hearing held in Trenton, New Jersey.

Key West was commissioned at Houston, Texas, on 7 November 1944, with Lieutenant Commander B. Papanek, USCGR, in command. Service history Key West stood out of Galveston Bay on 17 November 1944 for training exercises and escort duty out of Bermuda. The frigate operated there until sailing for Norfolk 22 December. Key West departed Hampton Roads on 18 January 1945, escorting a convoy to Oran, Algeria, and returned to Boston, Massachusetts, on 28 February. During the next four months, she made two cruises out of Casco Bay, Maine. Upon her return to New York on 14 June, from her final cruise, Key West remained at Brooklyn until 5 July, when she sailed for Boston for conversion to a weather ship. Overall, Key West crossed the Atlantic approximately six times. She departed Boston on 31 July, and after transiting the Panama Canal, arrived at Pearl Harbor on 23 August. Key West was then assigned to duty of weather station patrol in the vicinity of Guam, arriving there on 10 September. She operated out of Apra Harbor reporting meteorological data and stood by to aid ships in distress until 14 March 1946 when she arrived at San Francisco, California. Key West departed San Francisco on 9 April and served for three weeks on plane-guard station off the North California Coast. The weather ship arrived at Seattle, Washington, on 1 May, and was decommissioned at Bremerton, Washington, on 14 June 1946. She was sold on 18 April 1947 to Cascade Enterprises of Oakland, California, and scrapped. USS Key West was originally fitted with an evaporator to provide steam for the reciprocating engine and fresh water for the crew. However, the evaporators for accompanying destroyer escorts provided insufficient fresh water. Thus, Key West was fitted with an additional evaporator. This, combined with fresh water rationing by the crew of Key West, allowed the destroyer escorts to be loaded with extra, sufficient fresh water daily.

The Perspective is distributed for free to 31,000 homes every Wednesday and beats the local daily newspaper, the Kokomo Tribune in Monday through Saturday, and Sunday alone, circulation. The weekly paper tends to lean toward a union-friendly worldview, as Kokomo is a heavily unionized city, with FCA US and Delphi Automotive Systems being the largest employers. However, the paper carries columns from a wide range of viewpoints in the community, some of which are very conservative and at times hostile to the publication itself. The paper also publishes public vitals each week, providing information about citizens' court happenings, arrests, mug shots, marriages, divorces, causes of death, and obituaries. The section continues to be one of the most popular sections of the paper. One of the publication's overriding goals is to foster public awareness of the political process and to mobilize the citizens of Howard County, of which Kokomo is the county seat, to participate in electing local officials. In January 2017, local attorney Brian Oaks bought part ownership of the Kokomo Perspective with plans to fully purchase the business down the road. Don Wilson will continue to be the publisher for the next several years. In March 2017, Brian Oaks also purchased the weekly Kokomo Herald. In June 2017, the paper switched to being delivered via the United States Postal Service versus carriers to ensure reliable delivery every week. The paper size also was changed to the Berliner format, which is slightly narrower and shorter than the broadsheet format, making it more user-friendly. In addition to delivering 31,000 papers to homes in Kokomo, an additional 3,000 papers are dropped off at area businesses, which can be picked up, also free of charge.

The section east of Main Street reopened August 30, 2019. As part of the project, the Business 40 designation was decommissioned and replaced with the name Salem Parkway, which had been chosen by popular vote in 2016. This included changing guide signs to include the new name, as well as renumbering exits to follow the mileage of US 421\\\\. The name change went into effect on February 2, 2020, when the road reopened, though signage outside of the project area had been changed in late December 2019. Route description The Salem Parkway runs east-west through Winston-Salem and Kernersville. Despite carrying the north-south US 421 designation, it is considered an east-west road, though it is not marked with east and west directions on guide signs. The parkway begins on US 421 at Exit 238, the interchange with I-40 in Winston-Salem. The road runs northeast carrying US 421, meeting Silas Creek Parkway (NC 67) at a cloverleaf interchange before reaching an interchange with Stratford Road (US 158). From here, the parkway turns east concurrent with US 158, continuing east and joining NC 150 at Peters Creek Parkway. In downtown Winston-Salem, the Salem Parkway meets Marshall Street and Cherry Street before passing under the Strollway. A half- interchange allows access to and from the one-way northbound Main Street, with only a westbound off-ramp and eastbound on-ramp. The parkway intersects the John Gold Memorial Expressway (US 52/NC 8, though NC 8 is not signed at this interchange) at a cloverleaf interchange and meets Martin Luther King Jr. Drive immediately after. Leaving the downtown Winston-Salem area, US 158 exits the Salem Parkway onto Reidsville Road at a partial interchange, with the parkway continuing east concurrent with US 421 and NC 150\\\\. Entering Kernersville, the parkway comes to a partially built interchange with the under-construction Winston-Salem Northern Beltway (NC 74). Continuing through the town, the Salem Parkway meets South Main Street and then NC 66, with NC 150 exiting the parkway onto NC 66 to the north. The road then leaves Kernersville at a diamond interchange with Macy Grove Road. The Salem Parkway ends at a half-interchange with I-40 south of Colfax, with only an eastbound entrance and westbound exit on I-40. US 421 continues on I-40 toward Greensboro. History After the consolidation of Winston and Salem in 1913, the combined city was not only a merger of local government but a joining of two different road systems. By the 1940s, Winston-Salem grew to become the largest manufacturing hub in the state, thanks to companies like R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and the P.H. Hanes Knitting Company; while multiple highways connected the city, there was no road that directly went from one end to the other without making turns and as a result traffic congestion was a constant in the downtown area. From 1946 to 1956, various traffic pattern studies were performed and plans created that reshaped the city for the next fifty years. East‚ÄìWest Expressway Sunrise over Broad Street bridge In 1954, Winston-Salem gave the state $1 million to buy right-of-way for what was called the East‚ÄìWest Expressway; construction began that same year. Though it was planned to become a new routing of US 158, that changed two years later, when the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 was passed and North Carolina was allocated for their share of the Interstate Highway System; was subsequently allocated for a route from the Tennessee state line, through Asheville and Winston-Salem, to Greensboro. With the designation of I-40, the East‚ÄìWest Expressway would become the first completed section of Interstate in the state. On January 6, 1958, the first section of the East‚ÄìWest Expressway was opened, connecting between Cloverdale Avenue and Main Street. Because of the novelty, local newspapers ran a series of stories and diagrams on how to use the expressway, educating the public on how on-ramps and off-ramps work. Designated as I-40, the expressway soon ran concurrently with US 158 in 1959, from Stratford Road to Marshall (westbound) and Cherry (eastbound) streets. In 1960, the expressway was extended west into Yadkin County, at NC 801, and east to Reidsville Road. In 1961, US 421 was rerouted from Pfafftown and downtown Winston-Salem onto new freeway that connected directly with the expressway, then continued easterly running concurrently with I-40. In 1962, US 158 was realigned to continue along the expressway to Reidsville Road, its former alignment became US 158 Business (decommissioned in 1970). East of Reidsville Road, I-40/US 421 was extended onto new freeway to Kernersville, where it then linked with second built section of I-40 (late 1958) and continued towards Greensboro. Interstate 40 Business After 1958, the East‚ÄìWest Expressway segment of I-40 changed little while Interstate standards have changed considerably in regards to safety and faster speeds. In the 1980s, a study with the city and state concluded that construction of a new route was preferable to widening and modernizing the freeway through Winston-Salem. The state therefore lobbied the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), arguing that since this section predated the 1956 Act, it never received federal highway dollars for its development and construction, thus I-40 was incomplete in Winston-Salem. In October 1988, they were able to convince the FHWA, and Governor James G. Martin announced federal approval of $114.1 million for I-40 to be relocated onto new bypass south of Winston-Salem. In November 1992, the Winston-Salem Bypass was completed and opened; I-40 was officially rerouted at that time and a new designation was given to the East‚ÄìWest Expressway, Interstate 40 Business. =Hawthorne curve= Since its opening in 1960, the Hawthorne Curve, a 10¬∞ S-curve overpass of Hawthorne Road, became a infamous accident-prone location; typically speed related, cars and trucks wrecking against the curve and in some cases jumping the guard rail and falling off the overpass. Blame for the curve mostly fell on then Winston-Salem Mayor Marshall Kurfees, who is believed to have ordered the curve to protect political allies who owned businesses on Hawthorne Road and First Street. Kurfees spent the rest of his life denying the allegation, stating that the engineers designed it while he had no input to the project. Over the years, several studies were done and various little fixes were made to improve the situation including a reduced speed zone, better guardrails and the installation of blinking lights and flashing warning signs. In January 1998, the first major improvement in 40 years started with the realignment of Hawthorne Curve. At a cost of $26 million, construction lasted for two years building a new overpass and reshaping the sharp curve to a more gentle one. It was completed seven months early in the middle of 2000. =Brief Greensboro extension= In February 2008, I-40 was rerouted onto new freeway south of Greensboro, becoming part of the Greensboro Urban Loop. The old route through Greensboro became an extension of I-40 Business, with a hidden concurrency along I-40/US 421, between exits 206 and 212. This extended the route , ending at a new terminus with I-85/I-40, near McLeansville. However, NCDOT officials received many complaints by local residents and motorists on the confusion between the new I-40 and I-40 Business. Another issue was that funding for construction and repairs on the old route was slashed since it was no longer designated as an Interstate; business loops are not officially part of the Interstate Highway System. On September 12, 2008, with permission from the FHWA, I-40 was moved back to its old route through Greensboro, decommissioning Business 40 through Greensboro. =Macy Grove Road interchange= Construction began in June 2013 on the first phase of a project to extend Macy Grove Road around the east side of Kernersville. Macy Grove Road, which previously passed over Business 40 with no interchange and ended at Old Greensboro Road, was extended to a temporary terminus at a connector to East Mountain Street, with a diamond interchange built connecting it to Business 40. The extension and interchange opened in May 2015, at which point the former partial interchange with East Mountain Street immediately east of the NC 66/NC 150 interchange was closed and demolished and the westbound roadway through the former interchange realigned closer to the eastbound roadway. Salem Parkway From 2006 to 2018, NCDOT held over 400 meetings on I-40 Business In 2006, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) decided to rebuild the freeway between Fourth Street and Church Street, which covers most of the original section of the East‚ÄìWest Expressway from 1958. For the next ten years, NCDOT made several studies and a series of public meetings before awarding a design- build contract with Flatiron Constructors, Inc./Blythe Development Company Joint Venture and HDR Engineering, Inc., in September 2016, to complete the final design and construct the project. Considered as a $100 million do-over, the project included: replacing the existing roadway pavement, modernizing entrance and exit ramps, replacing nine vehicular bridges, adding two pedestrian bridges, lengthening the acceleration and deceleration lanes between ramps and widening existing roadway shoulders and adding new ones. When Salem Parkway opens, contractors will still be working on final touches. The opening speed limit will be . Once the project is totally completed, the speed may increase to . Salem Parkway unveiling NCDOT had also decided that once construction was completed, that I-40 Business would be decommissioned and a new name would be given to the freeway alongside the existing US 421 designation. The rationale was the continued confusion locals and travelers have between I-40 and I-40 Business. In November 2015, the residents of Winston-Salem metro area were allowed to submit a nomination for a new name, with a January 30, 2016, deadline. A selection committee, which included appointments from Winston-Salem and Kernersville, whittled the list to just four for another public vote. The eventual four finalist names were: Golden Leaf Parkway, alluding to the region‚Äôs tobacco-growing and processing heritage; Innovation Highway, showing the high-tech aspirations of the area; Piedmont Corridor, identifying geographic location in a highly developed part of the state, and Salem Parkway, which refers to the Moravian settlement founded in 1766. On October 21, 2016, Governor Pat McCrory announced, at the project's ground breaking event, the new name of the freeway as the Salem Parkway; which was the overwhelming favorite, receiving 53% of the vote. This name change took place when the highway reopened on February 2, 2020, though new signs will show the Salem Parkway name once they are installed. =Downtown reconstruction= On the first day of close, work began on the Broad Street bridge First phase of construction was focused on and around Peters Creek Parkway (NC 150), which included lowering the freeway to establish a minimum vertical clearance of at the new Fourth Street two-lane bridge and at the new seven-lane Peters Creek Parkway bridge. After two years of intermittent closures, the new Peters Creek Parkway bridge was opened on November 12, 2018. On November 17, the second phase began with the complete shutdown of Business 40 between Peters Creek Parkway and John Gold Memorial Expressway (US 52/US 311/NC 8); three alternate routes were set up through the downtown area for locals while travelers are encouraged to remain on mainline I-40. During construction, Business 40 was lowered to establish a minimum vertical clearance of for the new Marshall, Cherry, Main and Church Street bridges; Spruce Street bridge was removed and Liberty Street changed from an underpass to a overpass as a result. The Broad Street interchange was permanently closed and removed, the Cherry Street interchange will be modified with Marshall Street, and the Main Street interchange was modified to have only a southbound on-ramp and a northbound off-ramp. Two pedestrian bridges will also be completed, one of which will replace Green Street Bridge, and a Strollway Bridge adjacent to Liberty Street. On August 30, 2019, the section east of Main Street was opened. Reconstruction of the downtown segment was completed February 2, 2020. Exit list Exit numbers were renumbered to reflect U.S. 421's milemarkers.

H. Margetson's illustration for Maud Isabel Ebbutt's Hero-Myths and Legends of the British Race (1910) The loathly lady (, Motif D732 in Stith Thompson's motif index), is a tale type commonly used in medieval literature, most famously in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Wife of Bath's Tale. The motif is that of a woman who appears unattractive (ugly, loathly) but undergoes a transformation upon being approached by a man in spite of her unattractiveness, becoming extremely desirable. It is then revealed that her ugliness was the result of a curse which was broken by the hero's action.  Irish legend  The loathly lady can be found in The Adventures of the Sons of Eochaid Mugmedon, in which Niall of the Nine Hostages proves himself the rightful High King of Ireland by embracing her, because she turns out to personify the sovereignty of the territory (and is therefore sometimes referred in scholarship as a 'sovereignty goddess'). The motif can also be found in stories of the earlier high kings Lugaid Lo√≠gde and Conn of the Hundred Battles.  Diarmuid  In the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne was one of the most famous members of the Fianna. One freezing winter's night, the Loathly Lady brazenly entered the Fianna lodge, where the warriors had just gone to bed after a hunting expedition. Drenched to the bone, her sodden hair was snarled and knotted. Desperate for warmth and shelter, she knelt beside each warrior and demanded a blanket, beginning with their leader Fionn. Despite her rants and temper tantrums, the tired men only rolled over and ignored her in the hope that she would leave. Only young Diarmuid, whose bed was nearest to the fireplace, took pity on the wretched woman, giving her his bed and blanket. The Loathly Lady noticed Diarmuid's love spot and said that she had wandered the world alone for 7 years. Diarmuid reassured her and told her she could sleep all night and that he would protect her. Towards dawn, he became aware that she had become a beautiful young woman. The next day, the Loathly Lady rewarded Diarmuid's kindness by offering him his greatest wish‚Äîa house overlooking the sea. Overjoyed, Diarmuid asked the woman to live with him. She agreed on one condition: He must promise never to mention how ugly she looked on the night they met. After 3 days together, Diarmuid grew restless. The Loathly Lady offered to watch his greyhound and her new pups while he went hunting. On three separate occasions, Diarmuid's friends, envious of his good luck, visited the lady and asked for one of the new pups. Each time, she honoured the request. Each time, Diarmuid was angry and asked her how she could repay him so meanly when he overlooked her ugliness the first night they met. On the third mention of that which he had promised never to speak of, the Loathly Lady and the house disappeared, and his beloved greyhound died. Realizing that his ungratefulness has caused him to lose everything he valued, Diarmuid set out to find his lady. He used an enchanted ship to cross a stormy sea. Arriving in the Otherworld, he searched for the lady through green meadows filled with brightly coloured horses and silver trees. Three times he spied a drop of ruby-red blood and gathered each drop into his handkerchief. When a stranger revealed that the King's gravely ill daughter had just returned after 7 years, Diarmuid realised it must be his lady. Rushing to her side, he discovered she was dying. The 3 drops of blood Diarmuid collected were from her heart, spilled each time she thought of Diarmuid. The only cure was a cup of healing water from the Plain of Wonder, guarded by a jealous king and his army. Diarmuid vowed to bring back the cup. His quest for the healing cup nearly ended at an impassable river. Diarmuid was stumped until the Red Man of All Knowledge, who had red hair and eyes like glowing coals, helped him cross the river and then guided him to the king of the healing cup's castle. Once there, Diarmuid issued a challenge and in response the king first sent out one thousand six hundred fighting men, then one thousand eight hundred. Diarmuid single-handedly slew them all.Gienna MatsonÔºéCeltic Mythology A to ZÔºéNew YorkÔºöChelsea HouseÔºå2004ÔºöP.75 Impressed, the king gave him the cup of healing. On the return trip, the Red Man advised Diarmuid on how to heal his lady. He also warned the young hero that when her sickness ended, Diarmuid's love for her would end as well. Diarmuid refused to believe the prophecy, but indeed, it came true. The lady sadly understood that Diarmuid's love for her had died. She couldn't live in his world any more than he could live in hers. Diarmuid boarded an enchanted ship to return to the Fianna, where he was greeted by his friends and his greyhound, which the lady had returned to life as her final gift to him.  Arthurian/British legend  In her capacity as a quest-bringer, the loathly lady can be found in the literature of the Holy Grail, including Chr√©tien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail, Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival, and the Welsh Romance Peredur, son of Efrawg associated with the Mabinogion. The best known treatment is in the Wife of Bath's Tale, in which a knight, told that he can choose whether his bride is to be ugly yet faithful, or beautiful yet false, frees the lady from the form entirely by allowing her to choose for herself. A variation on this story is attached to Sir Gawain in the related romances The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle and The Marriage of Sir Gawain. Another version of the motif is the Child ballad \\"King Henry.\\" In this ballad, the king must appease the loathly lady as she demands increasing tribute from him. The next morning, he is surprised as she transforms into a beautiful woman.  Norse tradition  The loathly lady also appears in the Old Norse Hr√≥lfr Kraki's saga where Hr√≥arr's brother Helgi was visited one Yule by an ugly being while he was in his hunting house. No person in the entire kingdom allowed the being to enter the house, except Helgi. Later, the thing asked to sleep in his bed. Unwillingly he agreed, and as the thing got into the bed, it turned into an elvish woman, who was clad in silk and who was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He raped her, and made her pregnant with a daughter named Skuld. Helgi forgot the woman and a couple of days after the date had passed, he was visited by the woman, who had Skuld in her arms. The daughter would later marry Hj√∂rvar√∞r, Hr√≥lfr Kraki's killer. This tradition is also present in the Northumbrian tale The Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh. Similar to this tale, is that of Hj√°lm√æ√©s saga ok √ñlvis.  The Wife of Bath's Tale  The tale told by The Wife of Bath in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales is one of the most prominent examples of the loathly lady motif. The story begins during the rule of King Arthur over the Isle of Britain. It was a time when the people of the Isle of Britain were terrorized by friars who raped women. Instead of getting the women pregnant like the incubus did in the past, the Friars solely brought shame upon them without impregnating them. The plot of the story begins when a Knight of King Arthur's court rapes a young woman when he is overpowered by his lust for her. The King and his court then come to the conclusion that decapitation is a punishment fit for the crime at hand, however the decision is intercepted by the Queen and women of the court before it can be executed. The women persuade the King to grant him another chance on one condition. They propose that if the Knight can find what women desire most from their partners and report it back to them in time, then the Knight will keep his head. King Arthur then proceeds to accept the women's punishment and grants the knight this second chance. The Knight quickly seizes this opportunity and sets out on a journey that becomes more difficult than he first anticipated. Early in his quest the Knight comes to realize that each woman he questions seems to give him a different answer than the last. As the Knight's time begins to run out, he comes across a group of young women dancing and sets out to question them as well. But as the Knight draws near, to his dismay, the group vanishes and turns into a \\"loathly\\" old woman (a hag), who offers to help him with his dilemma. The old woman joins the Knight on his quest back and aids him in giving the answer to the women of the court. Together, the Knight and the Loathly Lady tell the women of the court that women desire sovereignty the most in their love life: women want to be treated as equal partners in their love relationships. The Wife of Bath continues with her tale and says that the loathly woman asks the knight to marry her in return for helping him. The knight submits to the hag's request although he pleads for her to take his material wealth instead. They marry and consummate the marriage that very night. When the old woman realizes how unhappy the Knight is she asks him why he is so sorrowful and he tells her that he is unhappy to have married such an unattractive wife. The wife responds to this comment by giving the Knight a choice: either he can have an old, unattractive, yet loyal wife or a young and beautiful wife that will be unfaithful to him. The knight decides to let his wife choose, and she transforms instead into a wife both beautiful and loyal, because he gave her the sovereignty to choose.

The village is just west of the A4074 road between Oxford and Henley. Early history In 1086 the Domesday Book counted 18 families as living by the sandy ford over the Thames between Iffley and Radley. Six hundred years later the population of the village had barely doubled, and it was still under 200 people at the start of the 19th century. Today the population numbers more than 1,000 and the parish boundaries have undergone considerable revision. Parish church of Saint Andrew In the middle of the 12th century a small \\"field church\\" dedicated to Saint Andrew was built on a hill in the Sandford manorial grounds for the use of the nearby Minchery nuns. The original Norman porch was restored and repaired in 1652 through the generosity of Elizabeth Isham but the majority of the improvement works to the church took place in the 25 years between 1840 and 1865. In the centre of the graveyard stands a fine yew tree planted on Good Friday 1800 and just to the east of the porch is a flat-topped gravestone from which bread was handed out to the poor of the parish. Four war memorials are on the south wall in St Andrew‚Äôs church: a wooden village shrine which lists the fallen of both World Wars, and three individual commemorative plaques to E.G. Wilkins, H.S. Cannon and H.C. Cannon. Each has been recorded and included in the National Inventory of War Memorials at the Imperial War Museum.Imperial War Museum Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller In 1239 Sir Thomas de Sandford gave land to the Knights Templar enclave in Oxford's Temple Cowley. In the reign of Edward II the Templars were suppressed and in 1324 the Knights Hospitaller took over. In 1541 Henry VIII dissolved the order, and the land passed to Cardinal Sir Thomas Wolsey. River and lock River Thames at Sandford Lock The river dominates Sandford's history, with the fertile meadows promoting agriculture and the water providing both transport and power. Roman pottery from kilns found on the northern edge of the village hints at Sandford's manufacturing heritage. The toponym \\"Sandford\\" suggests a river crossing, and there are references to Sandford Ferry throughout history. In May 1644, during the English Civil War, the Earl of Essex took his troops across the river at Sandford to join the battle of Cropredy. Within living memory there was still a ferry (later a toll bridge) at the King's Arms public house by the river taking traffic, including horses and carts, over the river to Abingdon, once the county town of Berkshire. An ancient mounting block can still be seen on the western river bank just below the lock, which travellers would have used to remount their horses having crossed the river on foot. In his book Three Men in a Boat, Jerome K. Jerome described the pool under Sandford lasher as \\"a very good place to drown yourself in\\". The watercourse behind the lock-keeper's house (dated 1914) flows from the \\"big lasher\\" weir which creates strong currents and eddies. In spite of the danger, this was a favourite swimming place up to the mid-20th century. In 1921 the river here claimed the lives of three Christ Church students, including Michael Llewelyn Davies, the adopted son of J. M. Barrie, who was the inspiration for Peter Pan. An obelisk that has stood here since at least 1821 records the deaths of six Christ Church students who drowned here in three separate incidents between 1843 and 1921. Even into the 1950s the river at Sandford-on-Thames was still regarded as a place to come and relax. On Sundays people came from Oxford to swim at The Lido below the lock and to picnic. The King's Arms had extensive tea-lawns on which to spend lazy Sunday afternoons. The first lock at Sandford was the navigation weir or flash lock situated on the old river channel at the site of the lasher today. This was described in 1624 as \\"Great Lockes\\" and was replaced in about 1632 by one of the first pound locks to be built in England. Iffley, Sandford and Culham locks were built by the Oxford-Burcot Commission following the Parliament Act of 1623. The old lock has since been filled in but its position can still be seen (the position of the upper gates can be seen in the stonework above the present upper gates). A new lock on the present site was opened in 1836 which lasted until the most recent improvements when the present lock was built in 1972. Littlemore Brook joins the River Thames near Sandford-on-Thames. Farms The Knights Templar name lived on until recently in Temple Farm, which was acquired by Magdalen College, Oxford in 1900. In the 1950s Gilbert Henry James Morris (known as Dick Morris) entered into a long lease with Magdalen College and together with his wife Freda founded the Temple Farm Country Club. The land encompassed several buildings including the main house which held the bar for members, and two floors of bedrooms where Mr. and Mrs. Morris resided and also included guest rooms. The barn also had a bar (the barn bar) and a large function room which hosted Sunday dinners and occasional evening events including weekly bingo and seasonal dances. The New Year's Eve dance was a particular highlight. There was also a caravan park, a cricket pitch and a marina on the Thames river. After Dick Morris' death in 1966, his wife Freda continued on in partnership with her son Lloyd and together they ran the club until 1985 when the lease expired. After the long incarnation as Temple Farm Country Club the property burnt down in the 1990s and was restored as a hotel, originally part of the Four Pillars Hotel Group and from 2016 part of the De Vere group.. Rock Farm, formerly called Sandford Farm, was bought by a Mr. Benfield in 1897. He and his partner Mr Loxley were owners of a building firm and developed the clay on Rock Farm to supply their building works with bricks. Apart from the road name, the last remnants of Rock Farm are the original farmhouse, now called Manor House and originally called Sandford Farm, with its tied cottages running down the left side of Rock Farm lane, another row of four to the right of Manor house and the old dovecote in Keene Close which was restored in the 1990s and stands in front of one of the houses in the recent Rock Farm development. The new barn style house in Rock farm lane stands on the floor plan of the original ancient barn which the developer of the site got permission to demolish. During the ground preparation for the new houses at Rock farm a large quantity of building stone was unearthed. some of which was dressed for windows and other architectural features. This may have been from Elizabeth Ishams house which was believed to have been near there. Some of the stone was incorporated into the reconstructed building at the back of Manor house which was the south end of the old milking parlor. Roman pottery shards and some firing slag was also found at the end of what is now Keene close. (Mr Gerald Keene was the last farmer to operate the farm at this site) Industry Next to and downstream from the lock is a waterfront housing development, Sandford Mill. Built in the 1980s, this occupies the site of the former mill which closed on Christmas Eve 1982. Originally a corn mill belonging to the Abbey of Abingdon and recorded in 1100 as owned by the local monks for bread making, it came into the hands of the Knights Templars at the beginning of the 14th century. It was converted to a paper mill in 1826 in order to supply the increasing demands of the University of Oxford. The listed cottages upstream from the lock (now River View) that can be seen across the road from the old wharf were also built in 1826. Occupied by mill workers, they originally boasted flat roofs made of tarred paper, (a first in Britain). The millrace continues to flow under the footbridge that crosses from the King's Arms pub to the lock. At the beginning of the 20th century the wharf adjacent to and upstream from the King's Arms was used extensively both by the paper mill and also by the brickworks, which developed well until 1914 when the engines were taken for service in the First World War. In 1920 the 126 ft tall brickworks chimney was demolished. The land is now a park home site. The name is preserved in Brick Kiln Lane (formerly Crab or Crab Gate Lane) running east out of the village towards the Oxford Science Park and Oxford United FC's Kassam Stadium which was completed in 2001. Henley Road The road through the centre of the village (now the Henley Road but formerly called both the Nuneham Road and the London Road) also crosses the Northfield Brook. A toll house known as Sandford Gate stood here until it was knocked down in 1920 and the present house was built. One of the earliest petrol stations, which served William Morris (Lord Nuffield) as he journeyed between Oxford and Nuffield was on the Henley Road opposite the present garage. The garage served as a Spitfire wing repair shop in the Second World War. The Second Wartime Boat Race, 1943 In 1943, the second wartime Boat Race between the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge was held on the Thames at Sandford. Like the first, it was unofficial and no Blues were awarded. However, public enthusiasm was high and the river banks were thronged with spectators, all of whom had to reach the course either by bicycle or on foot. Contemporary newspaper reports estimate the crowd at between seven and ten thousand. The Cambridge crew, unusually for the time, included a Dane at bow and a Turk at number four. The Oxford crew included four medical students. The race was rowed between the narrow banks of a downstream course with the start about below Sandford Lock and the finish at the Radley College Boathouse. Oxford won the toss and chose the Oxfordshire bank, with Cambridge rowing on the Berkshire side. Oxford set off at 40 strokes compared to Cambridge's 37, and were almost immediately in the lead and a length up in some thirty seconds. Despite being left at the start, Cambridge did not give up and responded well, with the judge‚Äôs verdict at the finish recorded as a win for Oxford by just two-thirds of a length. Amenities The King's Arms The village has two public houses: the King's Arms on the river (converted in the 19th century from the Mill malthouse), and The Catherine Wheel on Henley Road. The Fox (built in 1853 by the Morrell family) has been closed since 2009. The village has several public open spaces including a large, fenced recreation ground next to the church containing children's play equipment, a grassed area on the riverside near Sandford Lock which is the site of the old wharf, and recreation areas off Heyford Hill Lane which also contain children's play equipment. All are maintained by the Parish Council. The Oxford Preservation Trust owns the land between Broadhurst Gardens and the River Thames. The village shop and post office was closed in 1987. The nearest local shop is in the Ashurst Clinic grounds, a few hundred yards north along the Henley Road towards Littlemore. The Sustrans cycle path is accessible from the village across the river Thames and offers easy access to Oxford city centre along the river. Sandford is a scheduled stop for Salters Steamers' river boat services between Oxford and Abingdon. A regular local bus service between Wallingford and Oxford city centre serves the village. Street names Despite extensive local research by the Parish Council and local residents, no suitable ancient field names could be found that could be adapted for the new roads created at Heyford Hill Lane in the late 1990s. Consequently, surnames of past local residents were proposed, and they were accepted by South Oxfordshire District Council. The names adopted are: Batten Place: Richard Batten was the first Attendant at Littlemore Hospital, which opened in 1846. Buckler Place: J.C. Buckler was one of the original architects of Littlemore Hospital.Sherwood & Pevsner, 1974, page 689 Janaway: when the Sandford Link Road was built to pass underneath the Henley Road at the junction with Heyford Hill Lane, a property called Dool House had to be demolished. This large house, which stood at the end of Heyford Hill Lane, was built in 1810 by John Janaway, a wheelwright. The house was purchased by the newly opened Littlemore Hospital in 1848 to house the Hospital Chaplain. It later became a home for nurses and a residence for doctors.

On the occasion of his last NBL race the 1998 NBL Grand National in which he scored a perfect 1-1-1 score, i.e. winning all three of the mains he made a vow not to come back after he retired. Many pros like Turnell Henry, Frank Post and Brian Patterson raced after their official or unofficial retirements from BMX racing. Many like Stu Thomsen just raced basically for fun once or twice a year. Some like Eric Rupe and Harry Leary made it a second career to race in the junior \\"A\\" pros and/or ABA's Veteran Pro and NBL's Masters classes.

Future Islam, New Delhi, July/August 2006 Early life and academic career In his student years, Hans K√∂chler was actively involved as a Board Member of the European Forum Alpbach and established contacts with leading European intellectuals and philosophers such as Man√®s Sperber, Hans-Georg Gadamer and Rudi Supek of the Praxis school who he invited to his lecture series that he organized from 1969 onwards.Innsbruck Lectures 1969-1989 At the beginning of the 1970s, he had joined the team around Otto Molden, the founder of the European Forum Alpbach. These were his formative philosophical years; he initially developed an interest in existential philosophy, transcendental philosophy and phenomenology. In particular, he undertook an epistemological critique of Husserl's transcendental idealism\\"The 'A priori' Moment of the Subject-Object-Dialectic in Transcendental Phenomenology: The Relationship between 'A priori' and 'Ideality',\\" in: Analecta Husserliana, Vol. 3 (1974), pp. 183-198. and interpreted Heidegger's philosophy of Being in the sense of social critique,Skepsis und Gesellschaftskritik im Denken Martin Heideggers. Meisenheim a. G.: Anton Hain, 1978. opening up‚Äîin the Cold War era‚Äîa dialogue with humanist philosophers of the Praxis school in Yugoslavia and in Czechoslovakia.See correspondence with Rudi Supek in the archive of Arbeitsgemeinschaft f√ºr Wissenschaft und Politik, University of Innsbruck, Austria. As a doctoral student, he also had met in Alpbach with Ernst Bloch, Arthur Koestler and Karl Popper.See archive of Arbeitsgemeinschaft f√ºr Wissenschaft und Politik, University of Innsbruck, Austria. In 1972, K√∂chler graduated at the University of Innsbruck with a doctor degree in philosophy (Dr. phil.) with highest honours (\\"sub auspiciis praesidentis rei publicae\\"). In the years following his graduation he expanded his scholarly interest to philosophy of law and later political philosophy.Philosophie - Recht - Politik. Vienna/New York: Springer, 1985. Since the early 1970s he has been promoting the idea of inter-cultural dialogue which‚Äîsince the last decade‚Äîhas become known under the slogan of dialogue of civilizations. K√∂chler first outlined his hermeneutical philosophy of dialogue and his concept of cultural self-comprehension in lectures at the University of Innsbruck (1972)Kulturelles Selbstverst√§ndnis und Koexistenz: Voraussetzungen f√ºr einen fundamentalen Dialog (Cultural Self-comprehension and Co-existence: Preconditions of Fundamental Dialogue), in: Philosophie und Politik. Dokumentation eines interdisziplin√§ren Seminars. Innsbruck: Arbeitsgemeinschaft f√ºr Wissenschaft und Politik, 1973, pp. 75-78. In this text he coined the term \\"dialogue of cultures\\". and at the Royal Scientific Society in Amman, Jordan, in March 1974Text of the lecture: Cultural- Philosophical Aspects of International Cooperation. Studies in International Cultural Relations, II. Vienna: International Progress Organization, 1978. and discussed that notion in a tour around the world (March‚ÄìApril 1974) for which he got support and encouragement from Austrian Foreign Minister Rudolf Kirchschl√§ger (later to become President of Austria) and in the course of which he met with intellectuals and political leaders on all continents. Among his interlocutors were Yussef el-Sebai, Minister of Culture of Egypt,Al Ahram, Cairo, 15 March 1974. Prof. S. Nurul Hasan, Minister of Education, Social Welfare and Culture of India, Mulk Raj Anand, Indian novelist, Prince Subhadradis Diskul of Thailand, Charoonphan Israngkul Na Ayudhya, Foreign Minister of Thailand, Prof. Ida Bagus Mantra, Director-General for Culture of Indonesia, and the President of Senegal, L√©opold S√©dar Senghor.See the article published in Le Soleil, Dakar, 27 April 1974: \\"L'Europe a beaucoup √† apprendre ...\\" In recognition of his contribution to the dialogue among civilizations he received an honorary doctor degree (Doctor of Humanities honoris causa) from the Mindanao State University (Philippines) (2004).\\"MSU confers award on Austrian Professor,\\" Manila Bulletin, Manila, Philippines, 28 September 2004. In 2012 he received an honorary doctor degree from the Armenian State Pedagogical University. Hans K√∂chler, right, with French poet Jean Genet who was his guest in Vienna, Austria, for a reading from his text on Palestine in December 1983 In 1982 he was appointed as University Professor of Philosophy (with special emphasis on Political Philosophy and Philosophical Anthropology) at the University of Innsbruck. From 1990 until 2008 he has served as Chairman of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Innsbruck (Austria). In 2019 he joined the team of Berlin University of Digital Sciences.Berlin University of Digital Sciences / People / University Council. At Innsbruck University, Professor K√∂chler also has acted as Chairperson of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft f√ºr Wissenschaft und Politik (Working Group for Sciences and Politics) since 1971.

Curry in: Karol Wojtyla's Philosophical Legacy. Washington, DC: The Council for Research in Values and Philosophy, 2008, pp. 6-7. He published the first comment articles on the future Pope's anthropological conception.E.g. \\"The Dialectical Conception of Self-determination. Reflections on the Systematic Approach of Karol Wojtyla,\\" in: Analecta Husserliana, Vol. 6 (1977), pp. 75-80. During the 1980s he engaged in a critique of legal positivism (Philosophie‚ÄîRecht‚ÄîPolitik, 1985) and developed a theory according to which human rights are the basis of the validity of international law (Die Prinzipien des V√∂lkerrechts und die Menschenrechte, 1981). He also dealt with the applicability of democracy in inter-state relations (Democracy in International Relations, 1986). Legal theory led him to questions of political philosophy, and in particular a critique of the representative paradigm of democracy. During the 1990s K√∂chler got increasingly involved in questions of world order‚Äîincluding the role and philosophical foundations of civilizational dialogue‚Äîand in what he has called the dialectic relationship between power and law.

(meaning \\"Forward!\\" in English) was an Italian daily newspaper, born as the official voice of the Italian Socialist Party, published since 25 December 1896. It took its name from its German counterpart Vorw√§rts, the party-newspaper of the Social Democratic Party of Germany.  History = Foundation  Front page of the first number of Avanti! (25 December 1896). At the mid of the nineties of the 19th century, the Italian Socialist Party owned numerous newspapers and periodical journals published in various parts of the Italian Kingdom, but those had limited runs and they were funded by the same militants of the Party. However, PSI obtained an important result on the elections of 1895, and during the IV Socialist Congress of Florence in July 1896, programs for the editorial development were promoted along with the creation of a nationwide newspapers. The first number of Avanti! published on 25 December 1896, on Christmas, because the new newspaper had to represent the Italian socialism intended as \\"a new voice that does not descends from the vaporous sky of the highness, but it lifts from workshops and field, predicts the peace to man of good will\\".Santo Natale in After all, Jesus Christ was referred as the \\"first socialist of the history\\" in the contemporary socialist iconography. The first director was Leonida Bissolati, with Ivanoe Bonomi, Walter Mocchi, Alessandro Schiavi, Oddino Morgari and Gabriele Galantara as redactors. The last one was a designer and satirical cartoonist who drew the logo for the newspapers, characterized by an italic font and the exclamation point at the end with the typical liberty style of the end of the 19th century.. Along with Guido Podrecca, Galantara was also the founder in 1892 of L'Asino, an important satirical journal. Avanti! was inspired by the newspaper of the Social Democratic Party of Germany called Vorw√§rts. Previously, other newspapers had been founded with the same title: on 30 April 1881 Andrea Costa founded the Avanti! and philosopher Antonio Labriola launched Avanti (without exclamation mark) in May 1896, on which the libertarian socialist Francesco Saverio Merlino wrote. Di qui si passa In the editorial of published in the first number of Avanti!, director Bissolati wrote an ideal and political manifest of the identity of the new newspaper, challenging the contemporary order. Addressing directly to the Italian Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Antonio Starabba, Marchese di Rudin√¨, who had warned the PSI leaders and subscribed with the intimation \\"di qui non-si passa\\" ('Do not pass from here'), Bissolati answered \\"di qui si passa\\" ('From here we pass'), manifesting the faith and \\"scientific\\" certainty in the affirmations of socialist reasons and in the conquest of power by workers:Di qui si passa in File:Locandina Avanti! 1896.jpgAdvertising poster for the subscription to Avanti!, 1896.

File:1910 - avanti del 1 maggio.jpgAvanti! of 1¬∫ May 1910.  Format, prize and headquarter  The socialist daily newspaper was formed by four broadsheet pages. One copy cost 5 cents of lira, the annual subscription 15 lire, the six-monthly one 7.50 lire, the quarterly one 3 lire and the monthly one 1.25 lire. The headquarter was located in Rome, in Palazzo Sciarra-Colonna of Via delle Muratte. In 1911, on the initiative of Turati, the headquarter of the newspaper was moved from Rome (where an office for parliamentary chronicle remained) to Milan, in Via San Damiano. The number of pages became six, including news of Milan.  Repression of 1898  From January to May 1898, several popular protests blew up in almost all the Italian peninsula, for bread, work and against taxes, but the government suppressed the revolts. On 7 May in Milan, the government declared the state of siege and gave full powers to general Fiorenzo Bava-Beccaris, who ordered to open fire against the crowd. Hundreds of people were killed and thousands were injured. The exact number of victims has not never been clarified.According to the police, there were 100 protesters killed and 500 injured, while for the opposition the dead were 350 and injured were more than one thousand. On 9 May, general Bava-Beccaris, with the support of the government, dismantled associations and clubs considered subversives and arrested thousands of people belonging to socialist, republican and anarchical organizations, including some parliamentarians: among others, they were Filippo TuratiOn 1 March 1899, Turati was declared decayed from the parliamentary appointment and he was arrested with the allegiance of conducting the riots of Milan; he was later sentenced to 12 years of reclusion. Turati was however freed on the next 26 March after being elected again during the supplementary elections, and he made obstruction against the reactionary government of Luigi Pelloux. (with his partner Anna Kuliscioff), Andrea Costa, Leonida Bissolati, Carlo Romussi (radical) and Paolo Valera. All anti-government journals and newspapers were banned and on 12 May the entire redaction of Avanti! was arrested in Rome.  Avanti! and the Red Week  On 7 June 1914, in Ancona, an antimilitarist meeting was held in the local headquarter of the Italian Republican Party, organized by Pietro Nenni, a republican leader at the time and director of the local journal Lucifero, along with the anarchist Errico Malatesta. At the end, Carabinieri opened fire on the participants while they were leaving the hall, killing two republicans and an anarchist. As a reaction, The Chamber of Work declared a general strike and various revolts occurred. On 9 June, a great crowd took part to the funerals of the three killed which crossed the whole city. The news about the slaughter spread throughout all Italy and provoked demonstrations, parades and spontaneous strikes. In particular, souls were inflamed by the calls of Benito Mussolini, socialist at the time and director of Avanti!, who had caught in Ancona, during the XIV Congress of PSI from 26 to 28 April 1914, an important personal success, with plaudits for the results of dissemination and sells of the party newspaper, granted to him personally by congress members.Under the direction of Mussolini direction, Avanti! raised from 30‚Äì45,000 copies in 1913 to 60‚Äì75,000 in the first months of 1914. See also On the number of 8 June 1914 of the socialist newspaper, Mussolini wrote:Un efferato assassinio di Stato ad Ancona in With his articles, Mussolini, by leveraging on his popularity inside the socialist movement and on the great diffusion of the newspaper, forced the Confederazione Generale del Lavoro (CGdL) to declare a general strike, an instrument which stopped every activity in the country and that the labour union believed it had to be used only in exceptional circumstances. Mussolini exploited the popular revolts for political purposes within the socialist movement: leadership of PSI was in the hands of revolutionary maximalists after the congress of Ancona, but reformist were still the majority in the parliamentary group and in CGdL. On 10 June 1914, a political rally was held in the Arena di Milano in front of 60,000 people, while the rest of Italy was struggling and paralysed, Romagna and Marche were insurgent and rail workers finally announced to join to the general strike. After reformists of all parties said that the strike was not the revolution but only a manifestation against the massacre of Ancona, and that they would not be dragged into a useless carnage, Filippo Corridoni and Mussolini intervened. The latter exalted the revolt and his speech was reported and published by Avanti! on the following day:La seconda giornata in To prevent the risk that the monarchy could be feel threatened and declare the state of siege giving public powers to the army, CGdL declared concluded the strike after 48 hours and invited workers to resume their activities. That move frustrated the warlike and insurrectionist purposes of Mussolini who, on the Avanti! of 12 June 1914, accused the syndicalist leaders of felony saying: \\"The Labour Confederation, in ending the strike, has betrayed the revolutionary movement\\". The general strike lasted only two days, while the revolutionary movement was gradually running out after keeping entire zones of the country in check. On 20 June 1914, the socialist parliamentary group, formed in majority by moderates and reformists, disproved Mussolini about the events of the \\"Red Week\\" and confirmed the traditional gradualist and parliamentary position of the \\"historical\\" leadership of PSI, saying that the revolt was:Un ordine del giorno del gruppo parlamentare socialista in At the end of the same month, on 28 June 1914, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo shifted Italian attention on the European dynamics which will lead to World War I, opposing interventionist to neutralist, until the entry into war of Italy on 24 May 1915.  Avanti! during WWI  In 1914‚Äì1915, Avanti! supported an important campaign for the absolute neutrality towards the opposite sides in WWI. After maintaining that position, decided by the vast majority of PSI, Benito Mussolini pushed the socialist newspaper into an interventionist campaign with his articles as director. Thanks to his retinue within the party, Mussolini asked to the national direction of PSI to endorse his new line or otherwise he would resign, as he did in the following day. The new interventionist newspaper of Mussolini, Il Popolo d'Italia, would be published on 15 November 1914, with syndicalists and dissidents from the Socialist Party. On 23 November, Mussolini was expelled from the Socialist Party and the satirical cartoonist of Avanti!, Giuseppe Scalarini, drew the cartoon Giuda for the newspaper, representing Mussolini, with a dagger and the money of betrayal, approaching silently to hit Christ (the socialism) in the back.. However, the detail of money was not published by the newspaper.Giuda in Giacinto Menotti Serrati was appointed as new director of Avanti! during all the WWI, and he will be one of the leaders of the maximalist side of PSI and he will adhere in 1924 to the diktat of Lenin and Trotsky, joining the Communist Party of Italy.

Five squadrist assaults against Avanti!  Between 1919 and 1922, Avanti! was attacked and devastated by five squadrist assaults: = Assault against Avanti! of 15 April 1919 in Milan = L'Ardito, the arditi newspaper, of 18 April 1920 exalted the anniversary of the first squadrist attack against Avanti! on 15 April 1919 in Milano. On 15 April 1919, in Milan, nationalists, fascists, officer cadets and arditi were the responsible of the first squadrist assault, during that they fired and destructed the headquarter of Avanti!. Under the title Viva l'Avanti! (\\"Long live Avanti!\\"), the first comment about the fact said: Launch of the popular subscription for the construction of the new headquarter for Avanti! after the squadrist assaults, 23 April 1919. On 23 April 1919, the newspaper, printed in Turin, launched a \\"solidarity plebiscite\\" urging its readers and militants to subscribe for rebuilding the headquarter of Milan.Plebiscito di solidariet√† in and on 3 May 1920, Avanti! returned to be printed in the Lombard city.Milano proletaria alla nuova casa dell' \\"Avanti!\\" in = Attack on the Roman headquarter of Avanti!= In July 1920, the headquarter of Avanti! in Rome was besieged by a group of arditi during clashes with workers and tram drivers who were doing a strike.I nazionalisti provocano disordini a Roma in Ugo Intini wrote: = Bombs against the new headquarter in Milan = A new attack occurred in Milan during the night between 23 and 24 March 1921: the new headquarter in Via Lodovico da Settala 22 was devastated by bombs thrown by a fascist squad, with the purpose of an immediate retaliation to the massacre of Hotel Diana, provoked a few hours before by some anarchists.La cronaca di ieri in In this occasion, Pietro Nenni, still a republican leader at the time, intervened in favour of the socialist newspaper. Director Giacinto Menotti Serrati, after a few days, asked him to go in Paris as correspondent for Avanti!, in trial for six months.  Pietro Nenni at Avanti!  Editoral staff of Avanti! in Milan, 1921. The first sitting on the left of secretary Fasano is Guido Mazzali. The third sitting from left, with gaiters, is Pietro Nenni, and on his side, with moustaches and glasses, there is Walter Mocchi. The first above on the right is the satirical cartoonist Giuseppe Scalarini, with Giuseppe Romita sitting in front of him. On 19 April 1921, Nenni signed its first article for the socialist newspaper under the title of \\"The failure of Versaglia policy\\".La bancarotta della politica di Versaglia in In Paris, Nenni subscribed to PSI and began a path which, in around two years, would lead him to the leadership of the autonomist side of the Party. During the Congress of Milan in 1923, it was in favour of the merger between PSI and the Communist Party of Italy, as imposed by the Soviets and supported by Serrati and the Party secretary Costantino Lazzari. The congress appointed Nenni as new director of Avanti!. Since then, during the whole exile in France and the period of underground in Italy, the relationship between Pietro Nenni and Avanti! had become stronger until 1948.Various breaks occurred, during periods when Nenni was in minority within the party, o like when, after being appointed as Minister of Foreign Affair in the De Gasperi II Cabinet (the first of the Italian Republic), he gave the charge to Ignazio Silone, succeeded from August 1946 to January 1947 by Sandro Pertini with the co-direction of Guido Mazzali for the edition of Milan. On 31 December 1925, the Mussolini Cabinet made the law n. 2037 on press passed by the Chamber of the Deputies and on 31 October 1926 the newly established fascist regime closed all the publications issued by the opposition. Avanti!, like all the other antifascist newspapers, was obliged to interrupt their prints in Italy but continued to be published in exile, under the impulse of Nenni, in Paris and Z√ºrich every week.  Fall of fascism and 1946 referendum  Underground Avanti!= The socialist newspaper reappeared in Italy in hiding on 11 January 1943: a publication named Avanti!, without using the historical header with an italic type in liberty style, was distributed as the giornale del Movimento di Unit√† Proletaria per la repubblica socialista (\\"newspaper of the Movement of Proletarian Unity for the socialist republic\\"). After the establishment of the Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity (PSIUP) on 22 August 1943 (with the merger between the Italian Socialist Party and the Movement of Proletarian Unity), Avanti! began to use again the traditional header of Galantara, proclaiming itself as the giornale del Partito Socialista Italiano di Unit√† Proletaria (\\"newspaper of the Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity\\"). Giving the news of the stipulation of the Armistice of Cassibile, the issue n. 2 of the 47th year, published on 9 (incorrectly printed as 3) September 1943, was entitled La guerra fascista √® finita (\\"The fascist war is over\\"), while the subheading said La lotta dei lavoratori continua (\\"The struggle of workers continues\\") mocking the Badoglio Proclamation of 25 July (la guerra continua, \\"The war continues\\"). Avanti! of 16 March 1944, printed and distributed illegally in the territories of the Italian Social Republic and whose occupied by Nazi Germany, proclaimed: La classe operaia in prima fila nella lotta per l'indipendenza e per la libert√† (\\"The workers' class in the front row in the fight for independence and freedom\\"), with the sub-header: Lo sciopero generale nell'Italia Settentrionale contro la coscrizione, le deportazioni e le decimazioni (\\"The general strike in Northern Italy against conscription, deportations and decimations\\").It is the mass strike of 1¬∫ May 1944 which paralysed the industrial production of factories in Milan for an entire week. Marcello Cirenei, secretary of PSIUP for higher Italy at the time, remembered: The harsh repression after the strike caused the capture of almost all the leadership of the clandestine PSIUP of Milan(). See also The Roman edition of clandestine Avanti! was edited by Eugenio Colorni and Mario Fioretti, as Sandro Pertini remembered: The newspaper was published in clandestinity in Rome until the liberation of the Italian capital on 4‚Äì5 June 1944. The extraordinary edition of 7 June 1944 gave the news about the La Storta massacre of 4 June, heading: Bruno Buozzi Segretario della Confederazione Generale del Lavoro assassinato dai nazisti con 14 compagni (\\"Bruno Buozzi secretary of General Confederation of Labour murdered by Nazis along with 14 comrades\\"). Avanti! resumed the public diffusion in Rome and the Italian territory gradually freed, while it remained illegal in the Social Republic. Pertini was a protagonist in the printing and spreading of the first issue in Florence, immediately after the liberation of the city: The Milan edition of the clandestine Avanti! was edited by Andrea Lorenzetti, until his arrest by Gestapo on 10 March 1944 along with almost all the socialist leadership group of Milan: in the period between September 1943 and May 1944, twenty-eight issues were published. Immediately after the arrest of the editorial staff, the direction of the clandestine newspaper was given to Guido Mazzali, and thanks to his diligence Avanti! reached a circulation of 15,000 copies. Sandro Pertini had remembered the diligence of Mazzali for the socialist newspaper: Giuseppe Manfrin wrote: The Milan edition of Avanti! had been edited in the headquarter of Corriere della Sera until 13 May 1945, when the editorial staff moved to Via Senato 38, corner of Piazza Cavour, 2, in the former office of Il Popolo d'Italia.. = Return to the news-stands = On 27 April 1945, while the Northern Italy was being freed from the German occupation, an article signed by Pietro Nenni was published by Avanti! with the title Vento del Nord (\\"Wind of North\\"). The leader of PSIUP, exalting the struggle of partisans who succeeded in ousting or forcing the surrender of nazi fascists, found, within the will of redemption and renovation of northern people, the \\"wind\\" which would have swept away the residuals of the regime that governed Italy for over twenty years, a \\"liberation wind against the enemy from outside and those from inside\\". On 28 April 1945, news about the execution of Mussolini reached Rome and Sandro Pertini told that Nenni, brotherly friend and jail-mate of the duce in the past during his socialist period, \\"had red eyes, he was very moved, but he wanted to dictated the title anyway: Justice is done!¬ª.Giustizia √® fatta in . On 1 May 1945, after the liberation, the first number of Avanti! was published in Milan and it was dedicated to the International Workers' Day for the first time in twenty years with an historical political rally of Sandro Pertini. On the front-page, there was an article with photo portraying Bonaventura Ferrazzutto, under the title Gli assenti (\\"The missing ones\\"), where comrades fallen or victims of the deportation in Nazi Extermination camps were remembered.Primo maggio di libert√† and Gli assenti in = Fight for the Republic = After the liberation, Avanti! built an important instrument of propaganda promoting the vote in favour of the republic for the 1946 Italian institutional referendum, thanks also to the articles written by Nenni, and for the PSIUP for the general elections both held on 2 June 1946. On 5 June 1946, the newspaper proclaimed the results of the institutional referendum with the title: REPUBBLICA! ‚Äì IL SOGNO CENTENARIO DEGLI ITALIANI ONESTI E CONSAPEVOLI √à UNA LUMINOSA REALT√Ä (\\"Republic! ‚Äì The centennial dream of honest and aware Italians is a shining reality\\") In a dedicated section dedicated, director Ignazio Silone expressed the gratitude of socialist electors towards their leader, who fought for the pairing between the election for the Constitutional Assembly and the referendum, with the title Grazie a Nenni (\\"Thanks to Nenni\\").  Second post-war period  During the second post-war period, Avanti! had not reached the same circulation and influence obtained between the two wars but it became a witness, through its titles, of the rebuilding of Italy and its democratic evolution. = Center-left = The newspaper gave more emphasis on the creation of the first Italian center-left government with the direct participation of socialists after 16 years of oppision along with communist. On 6 December 1963, on the occasion of the oath of Moro I Cabinet with Antonio Segni as President of Italy, the front-page of Avanti! was entitled: DA OGGI OGNUNO √à PI√ô LIBERO ‚Äì I lavoratori rappresentati nel governo del Paese (\\"FROM TODAY EVERYONE IS MORE FREE ‚Äì workers are represented in the government of the Country\\").DA OGGI OGNUNO √à PI√ô LIBERO ‚Äì I lavoratori rappresentati nel governo del Paese in Avanti! continued to report the results of the reformative activity made by socialists within the center-left side of the government. The number of 15 May 1970 was entitled LO STATUTO DEI LAVORATORI √à LEGGE (\\"WORKERS' STATUTE IS NOW A LAW\\"), announcing the approval of law n. 300 promulgated on 22 May 1970, and the subheading stated: IL PROVVEDIMENTO VOLUTO DAL COMPAGNO GIACOMO BRODOLINI √à STATO DEFINITIVAMENTE APPROVATO DALLA CAMERA (\\"The provision wanted by comrade Giacomo Brodolini has been definitely approved by the Chameber)\\". The newspaper remembered the role of the then socialist Minister of Labour, dead on 11 July 1969 and considered as the real \\"political father\\" of the Workers' Statute, and attacks \\"the attitude of communists, ambiguous and clearly electoral\\" which determined the Italian Communist Party (PCI) to prefer the abstention on the provision. The editorial proclaimed La Costituzione entra in fabbrica (\\"Constitution comes in factory\\"), underlining \\"the explicit recognition of a new reality which, after the great fall struggles, in the heart of struggles for social reforms, sees the working class at the offensive, engaged in the construction a more democratic society\\". The similar title of the Avanti! issued on 1 December 1970 was IL DIVORZIO √à LEGGE ‚Äì Vittoriosa conclusione di una giusta battaglia (\\"DIVORCE IS LAW ‚Äì Victorious conclusion of a right battle\\"), and it underlined the approval of the new Fortuna-Baslini Law, a result of the combination between the law proposal of socialist Loris Fortuna and another one of liberal Antonio Baslini. The Fortuna project was of 1965 and it was stubbornly repurposed by the socialist deputy at the beginning of every legislature in which Fortuna was elected. On 14 May 1974, about three years after the approval of the law, the socialist newspaper proclaimed the result of the divorce referendum, promoted by Gabrio Lombardi, president of the Comitato per il referendum sul divorzio (\\"Committee for the divorce referendum\\"), and Luigi Gedda, president of Civic Committees, and supported by Vatican hierarchies and Amintore Fanfani, secretary of Christian Democracy at the time: the front page was covered by the title Una valanga di NO ‚Äì Strepitosa vittoria delle forze democratiche (\\"An avalanche of NOs ‚Äì Outstanding victory of democratic forces\\"). On 31 December 1975, Francesco De Martino wrote an editorial entitled Soluzioni nuove per una crisi grave (\\"New solutions for a serious crisis\\") which announced the withdrawal of PSI trust on Moro IV Cabinet,Soluzioni nuove per una crisi grave in confirmed on 7 January 1976La direzione decide il ritiro del PSI dalla maggioranza in and provoking the fall of the government. = From 1977 to 1994 = With the n.1 of 6 January 1977, Avanti! renovated its graphic layout: following the success of la Repubblica, which appeared in news-stands a year before, the socialist newspaper abandoned the traditional broadsheet format and adopted the tabloid one, the header had been coloured in red and the number of pages increased. The editorial, signed by director Paolo Vittorelli and entitled Anche questa volta si passer√† (\\"We pass this time too\\"), made a reference to the article written by Bissolati on the first number of the newspaper in 1896 with the title Di qui si passa. It is one of the first signals of the new course of Bettino Craxi secretariat in PSI, who became himself the director of the socialist newspaper in 1978 with Ugo Intini as editor-in-chief. In particular, Avanti! reacquired a certain fame among socialist during the eighties, thanks to the political analysis written by Craxi with the pseudonym of \\"Ghino di Tacco\\", a bandit of the 13th century. In 1992, the Mani pulite judicial investigation began and PSI fell in a crisis which would lead to an electoral and financial collapse. In August of the same year, Avanti!, directly conditioned by Craxi, launched attacks on the activity of pool of magistrates working on Mani pulite. Director Roberto Villetti resigned under request of the editorial staff committee by the National Direction of the Socialist Party for the disastrous management of the newspaper. Francesco Gozzano, already editor-in-chief, replaced Villetti. In 1993, circulation of Avanti! fell from 200,000 copies to a few thousand. Wastes and bad management during the eighties, despite the important funding for the modernization of the newspaper strongly desired by Craxi, provoked an accumulation of debts for about 30‚Äì40 billions lire; Avanti! lost also the public contribution for publishing (6 billions lire) because it did not certify the financial statements for the 2 billions lire deficit, causing the revocation of bank loans and of the return request of debt exposures. In March 1993 wages for employee were suspended for lacking funds. Ottaviano Del Turco, new PSI Secretary from February 1993, tried to mediate a solution to avoid the closure of Avanti!. In August 1993, a series of fund-raising events were organised but the newspaper failed to revive. The company in charge of the newspaper Nuovo Editrice L'avanti! was formally declared bankrupt in March 1994 after the electoral collapse of the Italian Socialist Party which had failed to gain a minimum of 3% of the vote. The fact that the paper was a political newspaper and the influence of the Craxi in a way contributed to its fall when the PSI was hit by heavy corruption scandals. In October 1993, desks and typewriters were seized to pay 105 million lire. The newspaper was in a chronic crisis and closed in November 1993: after nine months of work without retributions, journalists not longer judged as credible the reassurance made by newspaper and party leaders and they ceased to come to the redaction by voting the start of bankruptcy procedure during an assembly. Publishing house \\"Nuova Editrice Avanti!\\" was liquidated in January 1994. After 1994 With the dismantling of PSI, the newspaper fell under liquidation, as other assets of the party. The last congress, held in Rome on 12 November 1994, appointed a liquidator commissioner, Michele Zoppo, to whom was given Avanti among with other assets. After that date, three different periodical appeared in news stands that, though all of them recalled to the historical socialist newspaper, were completely different politically aligned: * In 1996, the clone newspaper L'Avanti! (with the \\"L\\") was published by the International Press of Valter Lavitola and directed by Sergio De Gregorio, founder in 2000 of the political movement Italians in the World and elected as senator with Italy of Values in 2006 and then with The People of Freedom in 2008. This newspaper ceased its publication after a few months and reappeared in 2003. Lavitola made of his periodical an instrument for political movements that had nothing in common with the editorial line of the original socialist newspaper. Furthermore, L'Avanti was close to the center-right premier Silvio Berlusconi. Lavitola and De Gregorio were investigated by prosecutor of Naples for criminal association aimed to fraud against the State: Lavitola, as de facto owner and co- administrator of International Press, and De Gregorio, as effective partner since 1997 and hidden co-administrator of the same company, along with other ten defendants, declared that the publisher of L'Avanti! had the requirements for obtaining the funds provided by the law for publishing, cashing illegally a total of ‚Ç¨23,200,000 received between 1997 and 2009. For this crimes, Lavitola and De Gregorio suffered a preventive seizure of assets for ‚Ç¨9 million in July 2012. On 9 November 2012 Lavitola negotiated a sentence of 3 years and 8 months in front of the Judge for preliminary investigations of the Court of Naples, while the process of De Gregorio, whom sentence was reduced to house arrest in his Roman apartment of Parioli following a failed re- election during the political election of 2013, was still in progress on 4 June 2015, with the request of plea bargaining by the former parliamentarian. Court of Accounts of Lazio, with sentence n. 24/2015 of 11 March 2015, condemned Valter Lavitola and Sergio De Gregorio to give back ‚Ç¨23,879,000 to the State for the publishing funds obtained illegally by L'Avanti between 1997 and 2009. * In 1998, Avanti! della domenica began to be published weekly as the body of Italian Democratic Socialists (SDI), sided on center-left, and it directly referred to the Sunday supplement of the historical Avanti!, issued between January 1903 and March 1907. After ceasing the publications in 2006, the weekly was issued again since 7 February 2010 (with Dario Alberto Caprio as editor-in-chief) as the official body of the new PSI (heir of SDI), member of Socialist International and the European Socialist Party. In this occasion, Ugo Intini, former director of Avanti!, greeted the new release of the socialist weekly with an editorial entitled Di qui si passa, quoting the title of the inaugural editorial wrote by Leonida Bissolati in 1896; * In 2003, Fabrizio Cicchitto and other former socialists re-constructed Avanti!, with Bobo Craxi as director. Although this Avanti! was formally neutral, its former director was a close friend of another former socialist Gianni De Michelis, who was then secretary of the New Italian Socialist Party (NPSI). The NPSI, which was in coalition with the centre-right, was an antagonist of the socialists who found home in the centre-left led by the Italian Democratic Socialists, who created an opposing weekly paper with the name of Avanti della Domenica which however ran out of funds and closed soon after. In 2006, Fabio Ranucci becomes director and quickly defines the paper an independent \\"socialist\\" newspaper of information. However, with the re-composition of the small often tiny Socialist political formations into the modern-day Italian Socialist Party in 2007, the paper became strongly associated with the latter. All the three periodicals are no longer published: L'Avanti! of Lavitola since 2011; Avanti! of Bobo Craxi merged in Avanti! della domenica in 2006 and the last one ceased the publications on 6 October 2013, following the creation of online newspaper Avanti! on 5 January 2012, thanks to the definitive reappropriation of the original Avanti! by the new PSI of Riccardo Nencini.

On 4 November 2011, the new bankruptcy trustee Francesco Spitoni definitively gave the property of the Avanti! original trademark to the PSI (with Riccardo Nencini as secretary) through the party treasurer Oreste Pastorelli. According to Spitoni, it is necessary \\"to guarantee the political and ideal meaning that newspaper Avanti! has in the Italian history, and in the history of the proletarian movement in particular\\", remembering that \\"this newspaper was founded by Andrea Costa, first socialist deputy in 1891, and it had been an official body of PSI since 1896\\". Spitoni then established to give \\"irrecovably and in an exclusive way, also moral, including the denomination, also partialially as well as the graphic layout, of the journalistic newspaper Avanti!\\". The assignation occurred free of charge because it had \\"the specific purpose to ensure that the historical newspaper of PSI, official body of the party since 1896, continues to represent the secular tradition of the Italian socialist movement\\". Therefore, Avanti! online has been online since the 5 Jangennaio 2012, with journalist Giampiero Marazzo (brother of journalist and politician Piero Marazzo) as editor-in-chief, replaced in September 2013 by former socialist deputy Mauro Del Bue. The newspaper is published by PSI through the Societ√† Nuova Editrice \\"Mondoperaio\\" s.r.l.; * Critica sociale, a company which publishes the homonymous periodical, registered Avanti! in 1994, one year after the cessation of the publications, according to the Italian law on press. The ownership was disputed, as for the other Avanti!, by the new PSI, given that the trademark was in the only availability of the bankruptcy trustee. The dispute was thwarted by the copyright attribution of the trademark and name of Avanti! to the ownership of Critica Sociale by the Trademarks and Patents office of the Department of Productive Activities of the Italian Ministry of Economic Development in 2012.

Gregg served as CIA station chief in South Korea from 1973 to 1975, an assignment he personally requested. During this time Gregg's personal complaint to the head of the presidential protective force about the Korean National Intelligence Service's involvement in the death by torture of a dissident U.S.-trained professor led to its chief, Lee Hu-rak, being replaced, and his successor enacting a prohibition on torture. Gregg, noting that his boss, Ted Shackley, had warned him against such interference, later described this as \\"one of the best things I did as a CIA officer\\". From 1975 to 1980, Gregg served at the CIA's headquarters and in Washington, D.C.; his responsibilities included responding to the \\"Pike Committee\\" investigating the CIA. In 1979 Gregg, his career in the CIA stalled by Stansfield Turner's new regime, took a post in the United States National Security Council (NSC) as Asia policy and intelligence matters specialist. He remained there during the transition from the Carter administration to the Reagan administration, and became Director of the NSC's Intelligence Directorate in 1981.

Engraving of Oberalteich Abbey from the \\"Churbaierischen Atlas\\" of Anton Wilhelm Ertl 1687 History The monastery, dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul, was founded in c. 1100 by Count Frederick of Bogen, a Vogt of Regensburg cathedral. After a serious fire in 1245 the premises were re-constructed under abbots Heimo (1247 to 1252) and Purchard (1256 to 1260). Under abbot Friedrich II (1346 to 1358) the abbey was fortified. The church was extensively altered in the time of abbot Johann II Asperger (1438 to 1463). The mediaeval monastery complex was modernised by abbot Veit H√∂ser (1604 to 1634), which was followed by a total baroque refurbishment under abbots Roman Denis (1682 to 1695), Benedikt Resch (1695 to 1704) and Ignatz Scherlin (1704 to 1721). The abbey was dissolved in 1803 during the secularisation of Bavaria, and the monastery buildings were disposed of. Accommodation for the local priest and a servant were set up in part of them. Church The abbey church of Saints Peter and Paul was rebuilt between 1622 and 1630 and is richly decorated. The baroque high altar dates from 1693. The church of the former abbey became the parish church in 1803. In 1847 the tombs and monuments were removed from the church and taken to Vilshofen where they were used for the construction of a dam.

It occasionally runs between New Delhi and Alwar. In 1998 it was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's oldest steam locomotive in regular service. The Fairy Queen runs on the same route as the Palace on Wheels, the tourist train launched in 1982, and in 1999 was awarded a National Tourism Award. History Rewari Railway Heritage Museum (formerly Rewari Steam Locomotive Shed) is the home of the Fairy Queen. The locomotive was constructed by Kitson, Thompson and Hewitson at Leeds, in England, in 1855, and reached Kolkata, then known as Calcutta, in the same year. On arrival, it was given fleet number \\"22\\" by its owner, the East Indian Railway Company; it was named 1895. Initially, the gauge locomotive was used to haul light mail trains in West Bengal, operating between Howrah and Raniganj, and during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 hauled troop trains. It was later consigned to line construction duty in Bihar, where it served until 1909. The Fairy Queen spent the next 34 years on a pedestal outside Howrah station. In 1943, the locomotive was moved to the Railway Zonal Training School at Chandausi, in Uttar Pradesh, where it served as a curiosity object for many of the students based there.  Other contemporary locomotives  A number of similar locomotives were built around the same time as the Fairy Queen. These were supplied by Kitson, Thompson and Hewitson and also by Stothert, Slaughter and Company of Bristol. One of these, Stothert-built Express, had been preserved at Jamalpur Locomotive Workshop, in Bihar, since 1901. As the inscription on Express pedestal claimed that it was the first locomotive to operate between Howrah and Raniganj, and it was numbered \\"21\\" by the East Indian Railway Company, it has been claimed that Express is the older of the two. Express was restored by Loco Works Perambur for running in 2011, making it a contender as the world's oldest operating steam locomotive. Express EIR 21 is currently running in different divisions of Southern Railway on weekends.https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/time- travel-to-the-steam-engine-era/article24508707.ece Specifications The Fairy Queen was built by Kitson, Thompson and Hewitson at Leeds in England in 1855. The coal-fired engine is powered by two outside cylinders measuring , and has a power output of , producing a maximum speed of . It carries of water in an underslung water tank. The locomotive weighs , and the coal tender . Built for the Indian gauge, it has a 2-2-2 wheel arrangement, developed by Robert Stephenson and Company in 1833, with a driving wheel measuring in diameter. Restoration The Indian government bestowed heritage status on the Fairy Queen in 1972, rendering it a national treasure. It was restored and given a special spot in the newly built National Rail Museum at Chanakyapuri, in New Delhi. Following the success of the Palace on Wheels, the locomotive was restored to full working order in 1997, in preparation for its first mainline journey in 88 years and its return to commercial service on 18 July. The two-day excursion saw the train plying the from New Delhi to Alwar in Rajasthan, with passengers spending an overnight stay at the Sariska Tiger Reserve. The locomotive hauled a carriage capable of carrying 60 passengers at a maximum speed of , with a service car holding a generator, compressor and pantry. The operation was repeated between December and February in the following years. It was certified by the Guinness Book of Records in 1998 as the world's oldest steam locomotive in regular operation. The following year, the train received a National Tourism Award for the most innovative and unique tourism project from Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then Prime Minister of India. In 2011, it was discovered that rare locomotive parts that were \\"as good as irreplaceable\\" had been stolen, and the locomotive was moved to Perambur Loco Workshop at Chennai, in Tamil Nadu, for repair. On arrival, it was found that an estimated 50 to 60 parts had been looted, including \\"the boiler, condensor, lubricator and flow tubes\\". The Deputy Chief Mechanical Engineer at the workshops stated \\"What we received is a dead body, a piece of metal whose every removable part has been removed, leaving only the metal shell. The list of parts to be procured is huge.\\" Officials estimated that it could take at least a year to restore the engine, even if suppliers of replacement parts could be found. Following a substantial rebuild, in which the workshops had to construct the missing parts themselves, the locomotive returned to service on 22 December 2012.

He uses urban dance styles in the context of conceptual theatre and has mixed various influences, including hip hop, to form abstract choreographic landscapes. Since childhood, Beltr√£o wanted to direct films and was fascinated by cinematographic and computer-generated three-dimensional universes. However, at the age of 13 years, he began to dance in matinees in his hometown, where he started his unexpected relationship with hip hop. In 1994 received his first dance lesson from the Israeli teacher Yoram Szabo. A year later, his studies was interrupted and he begins to teach street dance in academies of the city. In 1996, at age 16, he created the Grupo de Rua de Niter√≥i with his friend Rodrigo Bernardi. During its first two years, GRN was dedicated to competitive dance and made appearances at festivals and on television. During this period, while they lived intensely the hip hop world, the way the techniques of street dance were usually translated to the stage no longer attracted the group's interest as before. On the contrary, they started to desire to bring hip hop dance out of the limitations of its own definition. In 2000, Beltr√£o enrolled in the dance faculty of the \\"Centro Universit√°rio da Cidade\\", in Rio de Janeiro. In 2001 the duet piece \\"From Popping to Pop\\" debuted at the Duos de Dan√ßa no Sesc, in Copacabana. This piece was Beltr√£o's official debut on the contemporary dance scene in Rio de Janeiro. It was also a turning point in the career of the choreographer, who started to develop a personal vision for the dance he has been doing. Also in 2001, he created \\"Me and my choreographer in 63\\", with the dancer Eduardo Hermanson. At the end of that year, Rodrigo Bernardi left the company and Bruno assumed the direction of Grupo de Rua. Since then he has choreographed \\"Too Legit to Quit\\" (2002), \\"Telesquat\\" (2003), \\"H2\\" (2005) and \\"H3\\" (2008); In 2002, Grupo de Rua started touring internationally. They have presented in 33 countries (Portugal, Spain, France, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Croatia, Finland, Sweden, Italy, Scotland, England, Singapore, Canada, Argentina, Uruguay, Japan, South Korea, Morocco, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia, Syria, Uruguay, Chile, United States, Norway, Greece and Hungary).

The village is roughly 20 miles from the city of Gloucester. The village is known to have existed in the time of √Üthelred I who granted land to Abingdon Abbey, and it is mentioned in the Domesday Book. Dumbleton is on the edge of Dumbleton Hill, a foothill of the Cotswolds and is within the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Dumbleton is mainly residential, although there is a successful Cricket Club, Garden Club, an Infants‚Äô School, a Social Club, a Village Hall, and an Estate Office. The village also contains the main entrance to Dumbleton Hall, which now functions as a hotel. The civil parish includes the villages of Great Washbourne and Wormington, all of which were separate civil parishes until 1935.Vision of Britain website Parish church Sir Patrick Leigh Fermor St Peter's Church is of Norman origin with mainly 13th-century additions. The chancel was rebuilt in 1862. In 1960 it was designated a Grade I Listed Building. The travel writer Sir Patrick Leigh Fermor is buried in the churchyard with his wife Joan (n√©e Eyres Monsell) and brother-in-law Lord Monsell. Inside St Peter's Church is a memorial to their relative, Arctic explorer Gino Watkins. The merchant banker and political fundraiser Lord Hambro is also buried in the churchyard. A large painted monument dedicated to Sir Charles Percy son of the Earl of Northumberland and Dorothy Cocks, his wife, is also to be found within the church. The colourful monument of two figures kneeling over their deceased child is situated within a deep round-headed niche flanked by free-standing Corinthian columns. The redundant St Mary's Church, Little Washbourne is also in the parish of Dumbleton. The parish was in the possession of Abingdon Abbey until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The Old Rectory The Old Rectory The origin and development over the years of the Old Rectory is still subject to debate. The home as it stands was constructed in the 17th century. It is divided into two wings, north and south. The south wing incorporates a 16th-century timber- framed house with detailed decorative patterning. A blocked window at the rear of the house has a painted trompe-l'oeil of another window from which the Revd. Charles Cocks is seen looking out. His likeness was copied from a painting found in Eastnor Castle. The trompe l'oeil painting was painted by artists Roy Amiss and Benoit Gardner. Both the north and south portions of the Old Rectory are Grade II listed by English Heritage. Dumbleton Hall Dumbleton Hall The original Dumbleton Hall can be traced from around 1534, as the home of the Cocks family for over 200 years. After the death of Sir Richard Cocks in the late 18th century, the Hall fell into disrepair and was eventually demolished. Rebuilt in the mid 19th century using Cotswold stone, Dumbleton Hall became home to the Eyres family and in the 1930s, the Hall was well known for its popular house parties with regular guests including John Betjeman, later to become Poet Laureate. During the Second World War, the Hall was allegedly considered as a suitable alternative venue for the House of Lords. It is also suggested that Hitler 'reserved' the Hall as a private residence upon his victory in Europe. Following the death of the last member of the Eyres family to own the Hall, Caroline Mary Sybil Eyres-Monsell, Viscountess Monsell, formerly married to Bolton Eyres-Monsell, 1st Viscount Monsell, the Hall was sold and her son Graham and daughter Joan moved into the Mill House on the Dumbleton Hall estate. They were buried in Dumbleton as was Joan's husband Sir Patrick Leigh Fermor. The Hall became a hotel in 1959. Dumbleton Hall is Grade II* listed by English Heritage. Governance The village falls in the 'Isbourne' electoral ward. This ward runs east-west and stretches from the Worcestershire boundary to Teddington. The total population of this ward taken at the 2011 census was 1,955.

The first modern planetarium projectors were designed and built by the Carl Zeiss Jena company in Germany between 1923 and 1925, and have since grown more complex. Smaller projectors include a set of fixed stars, Sun, Moon, and planets, and various nebulae. Larger machines also include comets and a far greater selection of stars. Additional projectors can be added to show twilight around the outside of the screen (complete with city or country scenes) as well as the Milky Way. Still others add coordinate lines and constellations, photographic slides, laser displays, and other images. The OMNIMAX movie system (now known as IMAX Dome) was originally designed to operate on planetarium screens. Companies that make (or have made) planetarium projectors include Carl Zeiss Jena (Germany), Spitz (US), Goto and Minolta (Japan), Evans & Sutherland (US), Emerald planetariums (Israel) and Ohira Tech (Japan). 1960s thumb250pxZeiss-Jena Universal Projection Planetarium Type 23/6 1 - Constellation Figure Projector (North) 2 - Star Globe (North) 3 - Mechanical shutter of star field projector 4 - Milky Way projector (North) 5 - Planetary projectors (North) 6 - Lattice ring for Sun, Moon and Vertical circle projectors 7 - Horizon circle projector 8 - Planetary projectors (South) 9 - Star Globe (South) 10 - Compass point projector A good example of a \\"typical\\" planetarium projector of the 1960s was the Universal Projection Planetarium type 23/6, made by VEB Carl Zeiss Jena in what was then East Germany.The McLaughlin Planetarium of the Royal Ontario Museum, Jena Review. 1984: no. 3, p 144. The planetarium projector was a -long dumbbell-shaped object, with -diameter spheres attached at each end representing the night sky for the northern and southern hemispheres. Connecting the two spheres was a framework that held nearly 150 individual projectors, including those dedicated to the planets, the Sun, and specific stars. Each globe held representations of almost 4,500 stars per hemisphere. The \\"stars\\" were created by tiny holes that were punched into copper foil, ranging from 0.023 to 0.452 mm in size, the larger holes letting more light get through and thereby creating brighter star images. Two glass plates held this foil between them to create what was called a \\"star field plate\\". Each globe was illuminated using a 1,500-watt lamp that was located in its center. A number of aspherical condenser lenses were placed within each globe to focus the light onto the plates. Twenty-three of the most prominent stars had their own projectors, designed to project a small disk instead of pinpoint of light, and were also colored: Betelgeuse and Antares would appear reddish, Rigel and Spica would each have a blue tinge. An image of the Milky Way was created by using drum-type projectors that were studded with unfocused pinprick-sized holes based on photographic images of our galaxy. Specific projectors could imitate the light changes of such variable stars as Algol or Omicron Ceti, and other projectors could produce images of the constellations, of specific historical comets, compass points and other astronomical phenomena. When a particular star or planet dipped below the artificial horizon, a gravity-based mercury-filled shutter would be activated, blocking out the light. Recent developments in planetarium projector technology A Konica Minolta Infinium projection system at the Osaka Science Museum, with a starball in the back and the auxiliary projectors for planets in the front. These projectors are complemented by a Virtualium II digital projection system. Since the release of the Evans & Sutherland Digistar in 1983, a single projector with a fish eye lens was able to for the first time show stars from points of view other than Earth's surface, travel through the stars, and accurately show celestial bodies from different times in the past and future. In more recent years, planetaria -- or dome theaters -- have broadened their offerings to include wide-screen or \\"wraparound\\" films, fulldome video, and laser shows that combine music with laser-drawn patterns. The newest generation of planetariums such as Evans & Sutherland's Digistar 6, Global Immersion's Fidelity or Sky- Skan's DigitalSky, offer a fully digital projection system, in which a single projector with a fish eye lens, or a system of digital video or laser video projectors around the edge of the dome, are used to create any scene provided to it from a computer. This gives the operator tremendous flexibility in showing not only the modern night sky as visible from Earth, but any other image they wish (including the night sky as visible from points far distant in space and time). While many projection systems maintain their large single or multiple projectors, other systems cater to portable planetariums, like the Emerald planetariums LITE series, at 42lbs to 62lbs, and the Digitalis Education Solutions, Inc Digitarium Iota and Delta 3, at 20.6 and 33.5 lbs, respectively.

The system was named after Manchester City player Don Revie, who had the most important role in it. In 1953, English football was astounded by the Hungarian team which beat England 6‚Äì3 at Wembley Stadium. The Revie plan was a variation on the tactics used by the Hungarians, involving Don Revie playing as a deep-lying centre-forward, in a similar manner to Hungarian striker N√°ndor Hidegkuti. Revie started attacks by coming into the centre of the field to receive the ball, drawing the opposing centre- half out of position. The role can be retroactively compared to the modern false 9 role. The system was first implemented by the Manchester City reserve team, who using the system went unbeaten for the last 26 games of the 1953‚Äì54 season. Before the start of the 1954‚Äì55 season, Manchester City manager Les McDowall called his team into pre-season training two weeks early to try the new tactic.

Tarim is widely acknowledged as the theological, juridical, and academic center of the Hadhramaut Valley. An important focus of Islamic learning, it is estimated to contain the highest concentration of descendants of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad (sayyids) anywhere in the world. The city is distinguished for producing numerous Islamic scholars, including Imam al-Haddad. Additionally, Tarim is also home to Dar al-Mustafa, a well-known educational institute for the study of traditional Islamic Sciences. Geography The Hadhramaut Valley is a large region in southern Yemen spanning approximately . It consists of a narrow, arid coastal plain bounded by the steep escarpment of a broad plateau averaging around of altitude, with a sparse network of deeply sunk wadis (seasonal watercourses). Although the southern edge of Hadhramaut borders the Arabian Sea, Tarim is located around inland from the coast and north-east of Seiyun. The region is characterized by rocky plateaus that reach elevations of around , and are separated by numerous valleys. The closest airport to Tarim is located approximately away, in the city of Seiyun. The only international flights directly to Seiyun originate in Jeddah (Saudi Arabia, and Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. Otherwise, travelers can fly to the capital city of Sanaa. Then one can either take another flight from Sanaa to Seiyun, or travel by bus or car to Tarim from Sanaa. The distance from Sanaa to Tarim is approximately , and driving time ranges from six to eight hours. Climate Tarim has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh). The city receives very little precipitation. A few times throughout the year, however, Tarim experiences heavy rainfall resulting in significant flooding. History=Pre-7th century An ancient sculpture of a griffon from the royal palace at Shabwa, the capital city of Hadhramaut Wadi Hadhramaut and its tributaries have been inhabited since the Stone Age. Small mounds of flint chippings ‚Äì debris from the manufacture of stone tools and weapons ‚Äì and windblown dust can be found close to canyon walls. Further north and east are lines of Thamudic ‚Äòtriliths‚Äô with a few surviving crude inscriptions. On the fringes of the Rub' al Khali north of Mahra, a seemingly ancient track leads ‚Äì according to local legend ‚Äì to the lost city of Ubar.Ellis, Jim (1997) Hadhramaut's early economic importance stemmed from its part in the incense trade. Authorities exploited their position on the overland route from Dhufar through Mahra, Hadhramaut and Shabwa to the Hejaz and Eastern Mediterranean to tax caravans in return for protection. Shabwa was Hadhramaut's capital for most of the Himyaritic period. The kingdom of Saba' had its capital at Marib. The Queen of Sheba (Bilqis) could have come from either Saba', or been the Queen of the Tamim (who currently reside east of Tarim). The Himyaritic civilization flourished from c. 800 BC to 400 CE, when the incense trade was diverted to the newly opened sea route via Aden and the Red Sea. Early in the 6th century, Abyssinians invaded Yemen, encouraged by Byzantines to protect Yemeni Christians from Dhu Nuwas, the anti-Christian ruler of Najran who converted to Judaism. The Yemenis opposed Ethiopian rule and sought the Sassanid Persians for assistance. The result was that the Persians took over about 570 CE. The Persians appear to have been in Hadhramaut, but the only clear evidence of their presence is at Husn al-Urr, a fort between Tarim and Qabr Hud. 7th‚Äì8th centuries In 625, Badhan, the Persian Governor of Sanaa accepted Islam and the rest of the country soon followed. Arab historians agree that Tarim was established in the fourth century of Hijra. The citizens of Tarim converted to Islam in the early days of Islam when the delegation of Hadhramaut met the Islamic Prophet Muhammad in Medina in the tenth year of Hijra (631). Tarim is often referred to as Al- Siddiqi City, in honor of Abu-Bakr al-Siddiq, the first caliph of Sunni Islam (r. 632‚Äì634). Abu Bakr prayed that Allah would increase Tarim's scholars and water, as its citizens stood with him during the Ridda wars after the Prophet's death (632-633). A battle occurred in Al-Nujir Fortress. in which many of the Prophet's companions (Sahabah) were injured and taken to Tarim for treatment. Some companions however died, and were buried in the cemetery of Zambal. As part of the Great Arab Expansion, Hadhramis formed a major part of the Arab armies that conquered North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. In the mid-8th century, a preacher from Basra called \\"Abdullah bin Yahya\\" arrived in Hadhramaut and established the Ibadhi rite of Islam. By the 10th century conflict had erupted between the Hashid and Bakil, the two dominant tribes in the Northern Highlands. Sheikh al-Hadi Yahya bin al-Hussain bin al-Qasim ar- Rassi (a sayyid) was called from Medina to settle this affair at Sa'da in 893-897. He founded the Zaidi Imamate which reigned until Imam Al-Badr was deposed in 1962. In 951 CE, Imam A·∏•mad bin \`IsƒÅ Al-MuhƒÅjir arrived from Iraq with a large number of followers, and established the Shafi\`i madhab of Sunni Islam (according to majority of historians), which remains dominant in the region. A Rabat, or University, was first established in Zabid, in the Tihama, and, later, in Tarim. The latter still functions. 15th century In 1488, the Kathiris, led by Badr Abu Towairaq, invaded Hadhramaut from the High Yemen and established their dola, first in Tarim and then in Seiyun. The Kathiris employed mercenaries, mainly Yafa'is from the mountains north-east of Aden. About a hundred years after arriving their momentum was lost. The Yafa'is usurped western Hadhramaut and created a separate dola, based at Al-Qatn. British and the Qu'aiti Dynasty: 1882‚Äì1967 In 1809, disaster struck Hadhramaut following a Wahhabi invasion. Valuable books and documents from the Robat at Tarim were destroyed by fire or by dumping in wells. While the Wahhabi occupation was short-lived, it ravaged the economy. As a result, emigration increased, the top destination being Hyderabad (India), where the Nizam employed a considerable army. Here, a Yemeni soldier named Umar bin Awadh al Qu'aiti rose to the rank of Jemadar and amassed a fortune. Umar's influence enabled him to create the Quaiti dynasty in the late 19th century. Having secured all valuable land excluding the areas around Saiyun and Tarim, the Qu'aitis signed a treaty with the British in 1888, and created a unified sultanate in 1902 that became part of the Aden Protectorate. Ingrams' Peace Despite establishing a regionally advanced administration, by the 1930s the Qu'aiti Sultan Saleh bin Ghalib (r. 1936‚Äì1956) was facing stiff pressure to modernize ‚Äì a task for which he seriously lacked resources. These demands were largely initiated by returning Yemeni emigrants, such as the Kaf Sayyids of Tarim. The family of Al-Kaf had made fortunes in Singapore, and wished to spend some of their wealth improving living conditions at home. Led by Sayyid Abu Bakr al-Kaf bin Sheikh, they built a motor road from Tarim to Shihr ‚Äì hoping to use it to import goods into Hadhramaut, but were frustrated by opposition from the camel-owning tribes who had a transport monopoly between the coast and interior. In February 1937, a peace between the Qu'aiti and Kathiri sultanates, totally unprecedented in the history of that region, was brought about essentially by the efforts of two men: Sayyid Abu Bakr al- Kaf and Harold Ingrams, the first political officer in Hadhramaut. Sayyid Abu Bakr used his personal wealth to finance this peace, which was known universally thereafter as \\"Ingrams Peace.\\" This brought some stability, permitting introduction of administrative, educational and development measures. Modern era: 1967 to present In November 1967, the British withdrew from South Yemen in the face of mass riots and an increasingly deadly insurgency. Their arch-enemies, the National Liberation Front, which was dominated by radical Marxists, seized power, and Tarim, with the rest of South Yemen, came under communist rule. The Aden Protectorate became an independent Communist state, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). Hadhramaut, despite being part of the communist-aligned PDRY continued to live to a great extent on remittances from abroad. In 1990, South and North Yemen were unified. The town has remained unaffected during the Yemeni Civil War. Culture Hadhramaut is considered the most religious part of Yemen. It is a province in which the mixture of tribal and Islamic traditions determines the social life of its inhabitants. Apart from urban settlements, Hadhramaut is still tribalised, although tribal bonds are no longer as powerful as they once were. Hadhramis live in densely built towns centered on traditional watering stations along the wadis. Hadhramis harvest crops of wheat, millet, tend date palm and coconut groves, and grow some coffee. On the plateau Bedouins tend sheep and goats. The Sayyid aristocracy, descended from Islamic prophet Muhammad, traditionally educated and strict in Islamic observance, are highly respected in both religious and secular affairs. Zaydism is largely confined to the Yemeni mountains, where Hashid and Bakil are the dominant tribes. The rest of Yemen primarily adheres to the Shafi'i school of Islamic jurisprudence. Although Zaydis are Shias and Shafi'is are Sunnis, the practical religious differences are generally minor, and each will freely worship in the others' mosques, if their own is not convenient. Tribal groups Nearly all Yemeni tribes are of Himyari origin. Exceptions are mainly of Kindi stock, originating from an invasion from the north in the 6th century. Kindah are credited with the final destruction of Shabwa when they arrived, but they subsequently settled among and intermarried with Himyaris. The incidence of straight rather than curly hair often denotes Kindi blood and some Kindi are bigger physically than most Himyaris. Kindi tribes include the Seiar, Al Doghar (Wadi Hajr), the Ja'ada (Wadi Amd), and one of the sections of the Deyyin (on the plateau south of Amd). Living among the tribes, but a little different, are the Mashaikh. Unlike the tribes, they did not raid nor were they raided. They also wore a different type of jambiya, more designed for domestic use than aggression. Al Buraik still supply the bulk of the population of the Shabwa area. Most are settled but some are nomads grazing with the Kurab. Other Mashaikh are dotted around the hills and valleys. The most important are Al Amoodi of Budha, many being successful traders throughout the Middle East. Most tribesmen and Mashaikh are farmers, those in the mountains and the plateau almost entirely so. Further east or north, however, there is less rainfall and more nomadic people. The Manahil are almost entirely nomadic, except for those absorbed into modern life, and the Hamum and the Mahra are mostly nomadic. On the fringes of the Rub' al Khali, the people continue to graze where they can, although a surprising number of Seiar and Awamr farm on the ill-watered plateau north of the Hadhramaut. Architecture Geographically and socially varied, Tarim's diversity can be traced through the cultural interactions and hybrid architectural fabrics of various regions. Foreign styles and ornamental features entered Yemen as typological and aesthetic changes. In this way Tarimi architectural history represents a dialogue between cultures both within and outside of the modern nation. Mosques and libraries The minaret of Al-Muhdhar Mosque at Tarim is about high, and thus recognized to be the highest in South Arabia, one of the tallest earth structures in the world It is estimated that Tarim contains up to 365 masƒÅjid (mosques); one, the Sirjis' Mosque, dates back to the seventh century. From the 17th to the 19th century, these mosques played a decisive role on the influence of Islamic scholarship in the area. Tarim's Al- Muhdhar Mosque is crowned by a mud minaret measuring approximately , the highest in Hadhramaut and Yemen. The minaret was designed by the local poets Abu Bakr bin Shihab and Alawi Al-Mash-h≈´r. Completed in 1914, Al-Muhdar Mosque is named in honor of Omar Al-Muhdar, a Muslim leader who lived in the city during the 15th century. Tarim also features the massive Al-Kaf Library which is attached to Al-Jame'a Mosque and houses more than 5,000 manuscripts from the region covering religion, the thoughts of the Prophets, Islamic law, Sufism, medicine, astronomy, agriculture, biographies, history, mathematics, philosophy, logic, and the eight volumes of Ab≈´ Muhammad al-Hasan al-HamdƒÅnƒ´'s Al-Iklil (The Crown). Many go back hundreds of years and often contain vibrantly colored illustration. Between 300 and 400 manuscripts are believed to be unique in the Islamic world, according to the scholar Abd al-Qader Sabban. What distinguishes these manuscripts is that the majority belong to Yemeni authors and editors who resided in the Wadi Hadhramaut area. Nevertheless, there are others that belonged to scholars from Morocco, Khurasan, and other Muslim regions. In 1996, estimates for the annual number of visitors to Al-Kaf Library exceeded 4,780 individuals. Palaces Street view Tarim is famous for its innumerable palaces ‚Äì a collection of approximately thirty mansions constructed between the 1870s and 1930s. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Hadhramaut's merchant families grew rich from trade and investments abroad. The family of Al-Kaf was considered the most influential. Many members of the family were respected religious scholars. At the same time, they were among the regions first Westernizing elite and contributed to public works projects in the name of modernization. Their palaces remain as testament to both their affluence and the complex identity of the modernizing elite of the colonial period. Palaces financed by Al-Kafs and other families were executed in the stylistic idioms they encountered in British India and Southeast Asia. Consequently, the palaces include examples of Mughal, British Colonial, Art Nouveau, Deco, Rococo, Neo- Classical, and Modernist styles unparalleled in Yemen. While these foreign decorative styles were incorporated into the Tarimi architectural idiom, traditional Hadhrami construction techniques based on the thousand-year-old traditions of unfired mud brick and lime plasters served as the primary methods for executing these buildings. Qasr al-'Ishshah Complex The complex of 'Umar bin Shaikh al-Kaf, Qa·π£r al- øIshshah () is one of the original Kaf houses in Tarim. Shaikh al-Kaf built the house on proceeds made in South Asian trade and investment in Singapore's Grand Hotel de l'Europe during the 1930s. Ishshah derives from the Arabic root (,  ø-sh-sh}}, meaning to nest, take root, or establish. Qasr al-'Ishshah is a collection of several buildings constructed over a forty-year period. The first building, known as Dar Dawil, was constructed during the 1890s. As Umar's family grew, so did the size of the complex. Qasr al-'Ishshah exhibits some of the finest examples of lime plaster decoration (malas) in Tarim. The decorative program of the exterior south fa√ßade finds its antecedents in Mughal royal architecture, as well as the colonial forms of the Near East, South Asia and Southeast Asia. Interior stucco decoration differs from room to room, including Art Nouveau, Rococo, Neo-Classical and combinations of the three.Myntii 1999 The ornamentation often incorporates pilasters along the walls framing openings, built-in cabinetry with skilled wood carvings, elaborate column capitals, decorated ceilings, niches and kerosene lamp holders, as well as complex color schemes. From 1970 to 1991, Qasr al-'Ishshah was expropriated by the PDRY and divided up as multi-family housing. The house was recently returned to Al-Kaf family and legal ownership rights are shared amongst many of Shaikh al-Kaf's descendants. In 1997, the Historical Society for the Preservation of Tarim rented half of the house in order to present the building to the public as a house museum, the only one of its kind in the Hadhramaut. Education=Rabat Tarim Rabat Tarim is an educational institution teaching Islamic and Arabic sciences. In 1886, a group of Tarimi notables decided to build a religious institution for foreign and domestic students in Tarim, and accommodate foreign students. Those notables were Mohammed bin Salem Assri, Ahmed bin Omar al-Shatri, Abdul-Qader bin Ahmed al-Haddad, Ahmed bin Abdul- Rahman al-Junied and Mohammed bin Omar Arfan. Rubat Tarim was inaugurated on October 2, 1887. Supervision was ascribed to the mufti of Hadhramaut, Abdul- Rahman Bin Mohammed Al-Meshh≈´r. Early teachers in Rubat Tarim were Alwi bin Abdul-Rahman bin Abibakr al-Meshh≈´r, Hussein bin Mohammed al-Kaf, Ahmed bin Abdullah al-Bekri al-Khateeb, Hassan bin Alwi bin Shihab, Abu Bakr bin Ahmed bin Abdullah al-Bekri al-Khatƒ´b and Mohammed bin Ahmed al-Khatƒ´b. They were delegated to teach when Abdullah bin Omar al-Shatri was appointed upon returning from Mecca, where he had studied for four years. Al-Shatri taught at Rubat Tarim voluntarily until his death in 1942. He was succeeded by his sons (Mohammed, Abu Bakr, Hasan and Salem). In 1979, Rubat Tarim was closed by the PDRY. It reopened after the unification of Yemen in 1991 and continues to function. According to statistics from 2007, the number of scholars graduating from Rubat Tarim has reached over 13,000.

The majority of the CD contains their cover of the first album by The Ramones in its entirety. The band was approached to cover the album at a party for the completion of their fourth album, Wiggle. Having just lost bassist Johnny Personality, the band was unsure of its future, and they claim that the recording of these covers helped revitalize them. The band mixed the album just like the Ramones record, with the guitar panned hard to one side and the bass to the other. Very little was changed in terms of the songs themselves, though all were slightly faster than the originals. The album was recorded in approximately fifteen hours and released on vinyl on Selfless Records in a limited run of 1700 copies, 300 of which were on white vinyl. Selfless re-pressed 300 copies of the album in 1993 with silkscreened covers. The remaining tracks (15-18) are from the vinyl-only EP Formula 27.

The book is intended to succeed Peter J. Grant's Gulls: A Guide to Identification as the standard identification work on Northern Hemisphere gulls. Although the Helm series already contained a volume on seabirds, by Peter Harrison, gulls compete for space in that volume with several other seabird families; in addition, Harrison's book was published in 1983, a time when knowledge of gull identification (and taxonomy) was in a considerably more primitive state (and Harrison himself was a specialist in pelagic birds rather than gulls specifically). Malling Olsen & Larsson's book equals or exceeds Grant's work in terms of its level of detail, and consolidates and synthesises the considerable amount of new information that has been discovered since then. The first edition of Olsen and Larsson's book was released in 2003. While the book was initially generally well-received, a large number of errors soon came to light. As a result, this edition was withdrawn, and a reprint with corrections was released in 2004. Because the publishers required only the title page of the book to be returned in order for purchasers to receive the reprint free of charge, many copies of the first printing are still in circulation. (Those with a title page are identifiable by the absence of the words \\"Reprinted with corrections 2004\\" below the publisher's address on reverse of the title page.) The ISBN of the corrected reprint is . The corrected reprint has 608 pages. In total, 43 species are given full treatment by this work -- identification text, colour plates by Larsson, and several colour photographs (the plates and photographs are placed with the species texts, not grouped together in a separate section). In addition, three Southern Hemisphere species which have occurred as vagrants in the Northern Hemisphere (band-tailed gull, grey gull and swallow-tailed gull) are covered more briefly in an appendix, with a single photograph each, and brief mention is also made here of silver gull which has occurred as an escape from captivity. Preceding the species accounts, an introduction covers the book's species-level taxonomy, and gives general advice on gull identification, including ageing and moult, hybrid and aberrant birds, and the effects of lighting conditions, and plumage wear and fading. The book is particularly notable in that it is the first work to bring together information discovered during the late 1980s, 1990s and early 21st century on the identification of birds of the large white-headed gull complex. The book adopts a conservative approach at higher taxonomic levels, lumping all gulls (except for ivory gull, Ross's gull and the two kittiwakes) in the genus Larus. A revised taxonomy is adopted at the species level, however; a number of distinctive forms (mainly in the large white-headed gull complex) are regarded as separate species. Species-level taxonomic decisions adopted in the book are as follows: *American herring gull (Larus smithsonianus) is treated as a separate species from European herring gull (L. argentatus) *Yellow- legged gull (L. michahellis) (including the form atlantis) and Armenian gull (L. armenicus) are treated as separate species from the European herring gull *Caspian gull (L. cachinnans) is treated as a separate species from European herring and yellow-legged gulls, and is defined as including the forms barabensis and mongolicus *Heuglin's gull (L. heuglini) (including the form taimyrensis) and Vega gull (L. vegae) (including the form birulai) are each given full species status * Common gull (L. canus) (including the forms heinei and kamschatensis) and mew gull (L. brachyrhynchus) are treated as separate species. Olsen and Larsson had previously collaborated on two other volumes in the Helm series, on terns and skuas. Errors in the second edition The following is a list of errors in the corrected reprint: * On page 21, the illustration of a gull's head, with a pointer highlighting an ear-spot, shows a bird with a full hood; ear-spots are a feature which appears on hooded gulls only when the hood (a feature of breeding plumage) is lost, in winter.Adriaens, Peter (2005) Recensies: Klaus Malling Olsen & Hans Larsson, 2004.

Biography Ian Simpson was born and brought up in Heywood, near Rochdale, the oldest of six children. His father was a demolition contractor. Excelling in art and woodwork at school, and claims he knew he wanted to be an architect from age 12. He studied architecture at Liverpool Polytechnic and after he completed his studies he left to work in London with Foster and Partners. After three years, he moved back to Manchester and set up Ian Simpson Architects with Rachel Haugh. Simpson's lecturer‚Äôs post at Manchester University paid the bills; the practice wouldn‚Äôt make a profit for almost ten years. The main offices of the practice are in Castlefield, Manchester, and there is also has a London office, working on several projects in the capital. Beyond the UK, Simpson is building a new concert hall in Antwerp. In 2002 he moved in to live in a large apartment at No1 Deansgate, a new building he designed as part of the post-bomb city centre reconstruction. He now lives with his long-term partner Jo Farrell and their son in the penthouse at the top of The Beetham Tower. He designed the building (described as \\"the UK‚Äôs first proper skyscraper outside London\\") and bought the top two floors (48th and 49th) as a 12,500 square foot shell before construction started. He was interviewed in his home by Daon Bruni for weekly on-line magazine Fashion Art and Design Weekly in August 2013.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K42SN8jmZv8 The apartment includes an olive grove: 30 mature trees were hoisted up by crane before the roof was completed. The views extend to 56 km in clear weather.Joanne Lamm, South China Morning Post October 4th 2013 Early days The first projects were in Manchester, including the Green Room theatre, a nine-year project with Manchester Museum and work on Ducie House and in Castlefield, where the practice is still based. These brought Simpson to the attention of Sir Howard Bernstein and the city council. In the early nineties, the City Council tasked a new group to look at urban design principles for the city and produce a Guide for developers. The group was convened and led by article Lesley Chalmers, Chief Executive of Hulme Regeneration Ltd (a Manchester public/private regeneration partnership), following her facilitation of \\"A Guide to Development\\" for Hulme, published in 1994. She gathered together a dozen development and regeneration professionals (and two academics in the field) and organised a structured series of site visits and discussion meetings to draft the ‚ÄúGuide to Development in Manchester‚Äù (published January 2007). Ian Simpson was a member of the group, as was Nick Johnson, later to become CEO of Urban Splash. When the IRA bomb struck in the City Centre in 1996, the text to the Guide was competed and agreed by the Council, awaiting illustration and formal publication. The Guide, which shortly afterwards adopted as Supplementary Planning Document and Planning Guidance (SPD) was issued as part of the Council's brief for production of a masterplan for the reconstruction of the city centre. Ian Simpson Architects joined the team led by EDAW, chosen after open competition. Ian's local knowledge and his strategy to grasp the opportunity to expand the city centre formed the core of the proposals. Current In 2013 he took on Nick Johnson, Urban Splash‚Äôs former deputy CEO, in a non-executive role to help explore future direction. Simpson has also brought in experienced Manchester architect Roger Stephenson, whose own practice went into administration, helping him set up a new studio within the practice which will concentrate on projects at a different scale and type to Simpson and Haugh‚Äôs work.

He was a childhood companion of Guru Gobind Singh and took the vows of Sikhism when the Guru inaugurated the Khalsa in March 1699. Soon after that, the Guru sent him to Amritsar to take charge of Harmandir Sahib, which had been without a custodian since 1696. He took control and steered the course of Sikh destiny at a critical stage in Sikh history. The nature of his death in which he was dismembered joint by joint has become a part of the daily Sikh Ardas (prayer). Family = Ancestry  Mani Singh was originally called Mani Ram, and was the son of Mai Das of Alipur. He had two elder brothers: Jet (Bhai Jetha Singh) and Dayal Das. Mani Singh was one of the 12 sons of Mai Das. His grandfather was Rao Ballu, a reputable warrior, who was a general in Guru Hargobind's army. Mani Singh's family consisted of notable warriors, among them his cousin Bhagwant Singh Bangeshwar, who was a ruler in Aurangzeb time. His brother, Dayala was killed at Dehli with Guru Tegh Bahadur. Mani Singh spent a considerable part of his life in service at Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar. Marriages and children At the age of 15, Mani Singh was married to Seeto Bai, daughter of Raav Lakhi Rai Jadhaun Jadovanshi Raav (King) of Khairpur Tamewali now in Pakistan. List of Bhai Mani Singh's sons: # Chitar Singh, killed with Mani Singh in Lahore in 1734. # Bachitar Singh, killed in the battle of Nihan near Anandpur Sahib in 1704. # Udai Singh, killed in Sahi Tibi near Anandpur Sahib in 1704. # Anaik Singh, killed in the battle of Chamkaur in 1704. # Ajab Singh, killed in the battle of Chamkaur in 1704. # Ajaib Singh, killed in the battle of Chamkaur in 1704. # Gurbaksh Singh, killed with Mani Singh in Lahore in 1734. # Bhagwan Singh # Balram Singh # Desa Singh ‚Äì the author of the Rehat Maryada (Code of conduct) of the Khalsa. Seven of Mani Singh's sons were from his first wife, Seeto Bai Ji and the remainder from his second wife Khemi Bai Ji .  Career = Service of Guru Har Rai  When Mani Singh was 13 years old, his father, Rao Mai Das, took him to Guru Har Rai at Kiratpur to pay homage. Mani Singh spent about two years at Kiratpur in the service of Guru Har Rai, scrubbing cooking pots and utensils. He also attended to other chores. When Mani Singh was 15 years old, his father applied to Guru Har Rai for leave to be granted to Mani Singh for a short period. Mani Singh and his father returned to their village Alipur where he was married to Bibi Seetobai. Subsequently, Mani Singh, accompanied by his elder brothers, Bhai Jetha Singh and Bhai Dial Das, went to Kiratpur and presented themselves before Guru Har Rai for service at his shrine. Service of Guru Har Krishan After the passing of Guru Har Rai, Mani Singh started serving Guru Har Krishan. When Guru Har Krishan proceeded to Delhi, Mani Singh was one of the Sikhs who accompanied him. Service of Guru Tegh Bahadur When Guru Har Krishan died on 30 March 1664 in Delhi, Mani Singh escorted the Guru Har Krishan Ji's mother, Mata Sulakhani, to Bakala and presented himself before Guru Teg Bahadur for service. Mani Singh's elder brothers, Bhai Jetha Singh and Bhai Dial Das, also arrived at Bakala for service with the guru. Mani Singh was at that time 20 years of age. After serving some time in the service of Guru Teg Bahahdur, Mani Singh took leave of the Guru and returned to his village in Alipur. Mani Singh later proceeded to Anandpur Sahib for the Vaisakhi festival, accompanied by his family. Guru Teg Bahadur had then just arrived at Anandpur Sahib after a preaching tour in the East. When Guru Teg Bahadur heeded the appeal of the Kashmiri Pandits and their request for help in saving the Hindu religion, Guru Teg Bahadur decided to proceed to Delhi. Bhai Jetha and Mani Singh and some other Sikhs remained at Anandpur with Guru Gobind Singh to look after him. Bhai Mati Das, Bhai Sati Das and Bhai Dial Das accompanied Guru Teg Bahadur to Delhi. They were arrested together with Guru Teg Bahadur and taken to Delhi where all of them were put to death.  Service of Guru Gobind Singh  Bhai Mani Singh was a childhood companion of Guru Gobind Singh. He was not of the same age as Guru Gobind Singh (at that time called Gobind Rai) but much older. Mani Singh remained in his company even after Gobind Rai ji had ascended the religious seat as Guru. Mani Singh accompanied the Guru to the seclusion of Paonta where Guru Gobind Singh spent some three years exclusively given to literary work. Mani Singh was not only a great scholar of Sikh sacred scripture and wrote books on Sikhi but was also a warrior who accompanied Guru Gobind Singh as one of his body guards on many occasions. The brave deeds of Mani Singh in so many battles earned him the reputation of a great warrior. In his position of being the Guru's Diwan (Minister) he had to attend to many matters in the Guru's establishment. Nevertheless, he had time to study the Sikh scripture under the Guru's guidance and became an accomplished theologian. He acquired so much knowledge and understanding of Gurbani, that he used to do Katha (Exposition) of the Granth Sahib to the Sangat (Congregation) both at Anandpur Sahib and later at the Harmandir Sahib. In 1685, when Guru Gobind Singh went to Nahan, on the invitation of Raja Medni Prakash, Bhai Mani Singh was one of the Sikhs who accompanied the Guru. In 1687, when the Guru received a request for help from the widow of Baba Ram Rai, because the Masands were ill treating her, Guru Gobind Singh accompanied by Mani Singh went to Derah Doon, taught the Masands a good lesson and put them in their proper place. In 1688, at the Barsi (Death anniversary) of Baba Ram Rai, Guru Gobind Singh sent Mani Singh at the head of a Jatha of 50 Sikhs to represent him at the Barsi. Bhai Mani Singh accompanied Guru Gobind Singh when he went across the banks of the Yamuna River to Paonta, Himachal. Bhai Mani Singh fought in the Battle of Bhangani in 1688 ca. to defend Paonta from the joint attack of all the hill rajas. Mani Singh showed his prowess with the sword. In this battle his younger brother Hati Chand was killed. In 1690, in the Battle of Nadaun, Mani Singh showed great bravery and prowess with the sword; so much so that after the victory of the Guru's forces, Guru Gobind Singh bestowed on Mani Singh the title of Diwan (Minister). =Creation of the Khalsa= In 1699, on Vaisakhi day when Guru Gobind Singh established the Khalsa Panth and Bhai Mani Singh took Amrit at the hands of Guru Gobind Singh and from Mani Ram he became Mani Singh. On this day Bhai Mani Singh's brothers, Rai Singh, Roop Singh and Man Singh were initiated and five of Mani Singh's sons were also initiated as Khalsas. They were: # Bachitar Singh # Udai Singh # Anaik Singh # Ajab Singh # Ajaib Singh In 1699, after the Khalsa Panth was created with the famous Amrit ceremony and Rahit Maryada (Code of conduct of the Khalsa) was ordained, Guru Gobind Singh sent Bhai Mani Singh and five other Khalsas to Amritsar with instructions to take possession of the Harmandir Sahib. Bhai Mani Singh was appointed Granthi of the Harmandir Sahib and Jathedar of the Akal Takhat. Mani Singh thus became the third Granthi of the Harmandir Sahib, after Baba Buddha and Bhai Gurdas. Apart from Kirtan Singing of hymns from the Granth Sahib, Bhai Mani Singh used to do Katha (Exposition of Gurbani) which became a very popular daily feature. Rahit Maryada was propagated and arrangements were made for administering Pahul (initiation) to new converts to the Khalsa fold. As a result of Bhai Mani Singh's efforts, a large number of Jats (farmers) from northern Punjab were initiated as Khalsas, whose numbers increased day by day. Many of them, when they went back to their villages, persuaded others to take the pahul and become Khalsas. Periodically, Bhai Mani Singh used to go to Anandpur Sahib to pay homage to Guru Gobind Singh and keep him informed of the affairs and happenings at Amritsar. In the first battle fought by Guru Gobind Singh after the creation of the Khalsa Panth in 1699, against Raja Ajmer Chand and his Mughal supporters, Bhai Mani Singh and his sons were in the first line of the Guru's forces. The Guru was so pleased with the bravery and the performance of Mani Singh's sons that after the Khalsa victory, the Guru issued a special Hukumnama (Edict) in praise of them. Mani Singh's sons mentioned in the Hukumnama were : Bachitar Singh, Udai Singh, Anaik Singh, Ajab Singh, and Ajaib Singh. Bhai Mani Singh took an active role in the battle of Naduan in 1704. When Guru Gobind Singh Ji left Anandpur on the night of 20 December 1704, his family got separated at river Sirsa in the confusion created by the Mughal attack. Bhai Mani Singh took Mata Sundri and Mata Sahib Devan to Delhi via Ambala. In 1704, Bhai Mani Singh escorted Guru Sahib's wife and Mata Sahib Devan to Talwandi Sabo where the Guru was staying after defeating the Mughal army at Muktsar. Here Guru Gobind Singh from memory recited the current version of the Guru Granth Sahib while Bhai Mani Singh transcribed it. When Guru Sahib left Agra with Emperor Bahadur Shah for Nanded in 1707, Mata Sahib Devan and Bhai Mani Singh accompanied him. Afterwards Bhai Mani Singh escorted Mata Sahib Devan back to Delhi where she lived with Mata Sundri for the rest of her life.  Service of Banda Singh Bahadur  After Banda Singh Bahadurs execution in 1716 The Khalsa abandoned their homes and escaped to the jungles of the Punjab, mountains of Sivalik Hills and deserts of Rajputana. Role in Sikh history=A scholar Bhai Mani Singh acted as scribe when Guru Gobind Singh Ji dictated Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Bhai Mani Sahib collected the Gurbani (Literally \\"Word of the Guru\\") of Guru Gobind Singh Ji and compiled it in the guru granth Sahib (Sikhs living guru). The writings included in the Dasam Granth were composed at different times by the Guru himself. He expanded the first of Bhai Gurdas's Vaars into a life of Guru Nanak which is called Gyan Ratnavali. Mani Singh wrote another work, the Bhagat Ratnawali (sometimes called Sikhan di Baghat Mala), an expansion of Bhai Gurdas's eleventh Vaar, which contains a list of famous Sikhs up to the time of Guru Har Gobind. In his capacity as a Granthi of Darbar Sahib at the Golden Temple, Bhai Mani Singh is also stated to have composed the Ardas (Supplication) in its current format; he also started the tradition of mentioning deeds of various Gursikhs with the supplication. He also transcribed many copies of the sacred Sikh scriptures which were sent to different preaching centres in India. He also taught the reading of Gurbani and its philosophy to the Sikhs.  Leadership at Harmandir Sahib  Bhai Mani Singh who was under the presence of Guru Gobind Singh in 1690s had taken over the Harmandir Sahib at Amritsar in mid-1699 from Minas. After initiating the people of Majha to the Khalsa Panth Bhai Mani Singh came back to Anandpur Sahib. Bhai Mani Singh actively taught the reading of Gurbani and its philosophy to the Sikhs. According to some Hukamnamas, Bhai Mani Singh was heading the shrine in 1716. He spent the period of worst persecution in post 1716 at the village of Baganwala in Jhang district. In 1720, Mata Sunder Kaur came to know of the trouble that was brewing between the Tat Khalsa (A sect of Khalsa who were strict followers of Guru Gobind Singh) and Bandai Khalsa (A sect of Khalsa who regarded Banda Singh Bahadur as the Guru) military factions of the Sikhs. She appointed Bhai Mani Singh as the Granthi of Harmandir Sahib and sent him to Amritsar with Mama Kirpal Singh (Chand), the maternal uncle of Guru Gobind Singh Ji. On his arrival at Amritsar in 1721. Bhai Mani Singh restored peace among the Khalsa, by casting lots and the Tat Khalsa was declared to have won, and put the affairs of Harmandir Sahib in order. After Bhai Mani Singh's execution the next prominent Sikh leader was Nawab Kapur Singh (1697‚Äì1753) Execution Bhai Mani Singh being executed by dismemberment in 1737 ca., Bhai Mani Singh asked to Governor of Lahore, Zakaria Khan, for permission to hold the Diwali festival to celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas at the Harmandir Sahib. The permission was granted for a tribute of Rs. 5,000. He hoped that he would be able to pay the sum out of the offerings to be made by the Sikhs who were invited to come. He issued initiations to the Sikhs of all places. The Governor alongside Diwan Lakhpat Rai had different intentions and he sent secret orders to his forces to make a surprise attack on the Sikhs during the festival. Bhai Mani Singh came to know of this plan and sent messages to tell the Sikhs not to come. The Sikhs that did come had to leave because of the presence of an unnecessary big military force and suspicious movement of the officers. Thus no money could be collected or paid to the government and Bhai Mani Singh was ordered to be executed. Bhai Mani Singh was taken to Lahore in chains. When Bhai Mani Singh could not pay the fine the dues he had agreed to pay the Mughals (to legally hold the event) he was ordered to convert to Islam. Refusing to give up his beliefs he was ordered death by dismemberment. When the executioner started to begin with his wrists, Bhai Mani Singh sincerely reminded the executioner of the sentence, reminding the executioner of his punishment and to start at the joints in his hands. Bhai Mani Singh was executed at Nakhaas Chowk, Lahore in December 1738 ca. The Nakhaas Chowk has since been known as Shaheed Ganj ‚Äì the place of martyrdom. Another commemorative shrine built in the late 1900s at a Gurdwara near Longowal in the ruins of village Kaimbowal marks Bhai Mani Singh's hometown and place of birth. By 1737, the Mughal government of Lahore had strictly prohibited the Sikhs to visit Amritsar and bathe in the holy tank.

In Stick Soldiers 2 (abbreviated as \\"SS2\\"), rankings are point numbers, while the original Stick Soldiers (\\"SS,\\" or \\"SS1\\") gives rankings as titles, with the first being \\"Cadet\\" and the last, \\"Fragmeister.\\" Both games are generally very simple, and many players find that they quickly become repetitive. It is possible to create different sprites for all games, and the second allows modification of weapon attributes, new weapons, and new sounds. A third game was in slow development for many years beginning shortly after the release of SS2, which has since been abandoned. The webmaster for the first two games' websites was \\"SuperRoy\\" (Andrew Vehlies). SS1 and SS2 were created by AdmiralBinary, now known as \\"fonger\\" (Tim Cowley) ‚Äî who handled the games' C++ coding ‚Äî and anti_ (Dylan Allison), the main artist and mapper of the games. Cowley left the team soon after releasing SS2, having Andrew Russell replace him, and BlackjacK (real name unknown) replaced SuperRoy as webmaster. Allison remained, creating images and level graphics, and Russell hired six new programmers to the team, which has since disbanded. Stick Soldiers 1 The first Stick Soldiers game proved to be a major hit at Gamedev.net, where its production was enthusiastically observed. It used modifiable bitmap images and supported deathmatch with a primitive one-way CTF mode, later receiving (as a separate download) a red-vs.-blue Team version as another executable file. According to Cowley, it took only a few weeks to develop. Stick Soldiers 2 Bots fragging each other in team-mode on a custom map styled after the map \\"Airstrike\\" in Stick Soldiers 1, from Keron Cyst's \\"SS1 Remakes\\" mod. The next game in the series, Stick Soldiers 2 is a considerable expansion upon SS1, in that soldiers' movement is smoothly animated instead of using static bitmap images. It also adds more weaponry and versatility in modification (it allows weapons' attributes and sounds to be changed instead of graphics alone), bears a much more versatile map editor, and many more features, such as bounce pads, although some game features found in the first Stick Soldiers game (such as ricocheting bullets, the helmet powerup, and the popular Flak Cannon weapon) were not included in SS2. Many fan-made weapons, maps, mods, guides, and other miscellaneous files were once stored and accessible at the Stick Soldiers Files, a defunct file-sharing website. The development of SS2 took about 6 months, and was halted by a hard drive crash that destroyed the only existing copy of the game's source code. Though no longer called \\"alpha,\\" the last release was, according to Cowley, not nearly complete, but Cowley has nonetheless moved onto other projects since. Stick Soldiers 3 A concept screenshot of a map in SS3. Stick Soldiers 3 was the next installment, rumored to cost roughly $20USD for the full version. Its release date was unknown for years; Russell hired six programmers since development had been progressing extremely slowly, but the staff since continuously declared that work is progressing rapidly. Some speculated that the game would be released by roughly mid-2007, though after a comment by Andrew Russell himself, most Stick Soldiers forum members believed the true release date was around 2008. On 26 August 2007, the development of Stick Soldiers 3 was canceled, as announced by staff leader Andrew Russell.

Industries that dispatch include taxicabs, couriers, emergency services, as well as home and commercial services such as maid services, plumbing, HVAC, pest control and electricians. With vehicle dispatching, clients are matched to vehicles according to the order in which clients called and the proximity of vehicles to each client's pick-up location. Telephone operators take calls from clients, then either enter the client's information into a computer or write it down and give it to a dispatcher. In some cases, calls may be assigned a priority by the call-taker. Priority calls may jump the queue of pending calls. In the first scenario, a central computer then communicates with the mobile data terminal located in each vehicle (see computer assisted dispatch); in the second, the dispatcher communicates with the driver of each vehicle via two-way radio. With home or commercial service dispatching, customers usually schedule services in advance and the dispatching occurs the morning of the scheduled service. Depending on the type of service, workers are dispatched individually or in teams of two or more. Dispatchers have to coordinate worker availability, skill, travel time and availability of parts. The skills required of a dispatcher are greatly enhanced with the use of computer dispatching software (see computer aided call handling). Manual dispatch systems The following are examples of manual systems used to track the status of resources in a dispatched fleet. Cards Card systems employ a set of shelves with a slot for each unit in the dispatch fleet. Each vehicle or resource has a slot in the shelving system. In it, a card, like a time card used to track an employee's work hours, is stored. A time clock, similar to the one that stamps work hours on a time card, is used to stamp event times on each card. At the beginning of a work day, the resource's identifier or other information is handwritten on the card. Each time the resource's status changes, the card is punched in the time clock and a new status entry is handwritten on the card. The card collects a series of entries through the work shift. In a tow truck example, the card might be labeled with the tow car's radio identifier, \\"Downtown 6\\" and may be labeled with the vehicle number or data about the capabilities of the specific tow car. It might give a weight capacity, show the unit as a flat bed or cradle snatcher, or mention the unit carries a can of Diesel fuel. The name of the staff on the car might be noted. At the start of a shift, the dispatcher would note the unit \\"available\\" and time stamp the card. At the assignment to a call, the call information would be written on the card and the card might be stamped at the moment the assignment is read to the tow car crew. The string of notes and time stamps allows dispatch staff to get a clear picture of the status of a small fleet. Some systems use shelving with red and green lights and a switch at the back of the card slot. If the resource's card is pushed all the way into the card slot, the switch is actuated and an indicator lamp turns red. This identifies the tow car whose card occupies that slot as not available, or assigned to a call. Leaving the card pulled partway out leaves the indicator green, showing the dispatcher that unit is available. Is anyone available? The lights are supposed to give the dispatch staff a snapshot of their resource situation. A major flaw of this system is that cards are inside shelves and trying to look at an entire set of cards to evaluate the overall situation requires the dispatcher to pull out every card, one at a time, and read it. If two or more resources are sent to the same call, the dispatcher has a lot of writing to do. Punched tags Punched tag systems employ a set of pegs with each peg holding tags for one unit in the dispatch fleet. Each vehicle working the current shift has a peg with a tag describing the unit's current status. A time clock, similar to the one that stamps work hours on a time card, is used to stamp times on each tag. At the beginning of a work day, the resource's identifier may be posted above the peg. The unit's start time is stamped and their status is written on the tag. Each time the resource's status changes, a new tag is written and the tag is time stamped in order to log the time the unit's status changed. The peg collects a stack of tags through the work shift. In a tow truck example, the peg might be labeled with the tow car's radio identifier, \\"Downtown 6\\" and may be labeled with the vehicle number or data about the capabilities of the specific tow car. It might give a weight capacity, show the unit as a flat bed or cradle snatcher, or mention the unit carries a can of Diesel fuel. The name of the staff on the tow car might be noted. At the start of a shift, the dispatcher would note the unit \\"available\\" and time stamp a tag, then hang it on that unit's peg. At the assignment to a call, the call information would be written on another tag and the tag might be stamped at the moment the assignment is read to the tow car crew. The tag would then be hung on that unit's peg. The stack of tags allows dispatch staff to get a clear picture of the status of a small fleet. Some systems use colored tags to show general categories of events such as \\"available\\". For example, each unit that is available might have the fact noted on an orange tag. Is anyone available? A glance at the pegboard shows anybody whose tag is \\"orange\\" is available. An repossession might use a yellow tag to identify a service call with a safety issue where the police should be called in the event the tow car crew doesn't check in by radio within five minutes. A blue tag might show a resource is taking a dinner or lunch break. A major flaw of this system is that tags can easily be posted on the wrong peg, causing confusion. This can be countered by writing unit identifiers on every tag: a lot of work. In colored-tag systems, it is always possible to run out of certain colors of tags, messing up the system. If two or more resources are sent to the same call, the dispatcher has a lot of writing to do. Plastic icons In a plastic icon system, the blank panel on the communications console or a nearby wall is fitted with a sheet of Velcro. The material has vertical stripes painted on it, making a column for each of several possible status conditions. The simplest system is two columns: available and unavailable. Magnetized icons can be used in place of Velcro. The icons can be coloured or shaped to identify the type of unit or some other feature of the resource. Each vehicle working the current shift has an icon placed in the column describing the unit's current status. A log book is used to track times, event details, and other information about calls for service. In a tow truck example, the icon might be labelled with the tow car's radio identifier, \\"Down town 6\\". During a shift, the icon would be moved by the dispatcher into whatever column describes the resource's current condition. Alternatively, there could be columns for some other condition such as the names of move-up or standby points where resources are sent to backfill for busy tow cars. A major flaw of this system is that icons can easily be misplaced or fall off of the status board. Magnetic objects can damage cathode ray tube displays if they get too close to the display face or housing.  Airline dispatch  In airline operations in a few countries, a dispatcher shares legal responsibility for a flight's safety with its pilot, and may delay, divert or cancel a flight if there is reason to do so. This checks and balances mechanism supposedly improves the safety of the dispatch system, although most countries do not use this system and there is no noticeable detriment to flight safety. A dispatcher typically must be licensed by the aviation authority of a country. The examination for the licence requires the candidate to demonstrate knowledge in meteorology and aviation comparable to that required to obtain an Airline Transport Pilot Licence.  Mobile dispatch  In a mobile system, wireless technology is provided for efficient job planning, assignment and efficient job planning through the use of mobile dispatch systems sent out through a mobile network on to a mobile device such as PDA. This allows for more flexible management of the workers out in the field as a job can be dispatched to multiple users to accept or reject the job. The benefits of a mobile system as it can then be integrated back into the other software systems used by an organization such as asset management, rostering, and other financial systems.  Trucking dispatch  Trucking dispatchers play a major role in transportation logistics. Truck dispatchers orchestrate freight movement and equipment from one place to another while keeping close communication with truck drivers. Some dispatching companies help truck drivers to negotiate and acquire loads and handle paperwork. Dispatching trucks require a variety of skills like using a computer to find and track loads for drivers to speaking multiple languages depending on the region or number of trucks they manage. Great customer service and good communication are vital for succeeding in this fast-paced environment. Capacity and metrics There is a limit to how many field units can be managed. This varies with circumstances. For example, a parcel delivery service dispatcher may encounter higher traffic around Christmas. Work is not evenly distributed across time: in any dispatch system there are traditional peaks or busy hours in requests for service. Some workplace cultures will allow longer wait times than others. Systems may use a Radiotelephony procedure to reduce talking time, allowing interaction with a larger dispatch fleet. Air traffic control and towing are two examples. The use of abbreviations or standard phrases can reduce the length of a transaction. Capacity may be reduced by relaxed voice procedure such as a delivery dispatcher giving a lengthy description of a customer complaint over the radio. It is generally accepted that giving field units computers connected with the computer-aided dispatch, or another enterprise system used for dispatch, unloads voice two-way radio channels and increases capacity. Users research information on their terminal or laptop instead of calling in with a request that the dispatcher do it.Suggested reading: \\"Congestion and Coverage Concerns,\\" Contra Costa County Public Safety Mobile Radio Master Plan, (Fairfax, Virginia: Federal Engineering, Inc., 2002,) pp. 18. One source suggests radio traffic drops by 30% when computers are available to mobile users.\\"4.5 Mobile Data Systems,\\" San Rafael Police Radio Committee: Report to Mayor and City Council, (San Rafael, California: City of San Rafael, 1995,) pp. 23. Radio Measurements of communications may reflect dispatch capacity. A partial definition of capacity comes from the number of communications channels required to support a dispatch fleet. Two metrics of channel capacity may be: 1) the number of field units or resources dispatched, and; 2)number of push-to-talk presses per day.Some touch screen radio dispatch consoles can keep a tally of push-to-talk presses. A resource may refer to a fire engine, tow truck, taxi, or refuse truck, regardless of how many walkie- talkies, mobile radios, or persons were fielded along with each resource. One suggestion is that 100 to 150 mobiles is the maximum practical on one channel.See: \\"Section I: General,\\" The California Highway Patrol Communications Technology Research Project on 800 MHz, 80-C477, (Sacramento, California: Department of General Services, Communications Technology Division, 1982,) pp. I-5. Another suggests 60-70 units as a maximum.Suggested reading: \\"Congestion and Coverage Concerns,\\" Contra Costa County Public Safety Mobile Radio Master Plan, (Fairfax, Virginia: Federal Engineering, Inc., 2002,) pp. 18. The difference in these two ranges probably reflects the wording. For example, 120 mobiles may mean radios: 60 units each containing a mobile radio and an officer with a walkie talkie.It may also reflect differences in operational styles between the Contra Costa Sheriffs Department and Highway Patrol. It might be that the average Highway Patrol officer interacts less often with their dispatcher. For dispatch systems like take-out food delivery, where life safety is not an issue, delays may be acceptable. Delays increase capacity. Another possible measure of capacity is system push- to-talk presses. A 187-day study of four Contra Costa County, California Sheriffs Department conventional two-way radio dispatch channels showed an average of around 2,500 push-to-talk presses per day. The count was within +/-350 a day across all four primary dispatch channels.Data were supplied by the Sheriffs Department. Suggested reading: \\"Congestion and Coverage Concerns,\\" Contra Costa County Public Safety Mobile Radio Master Plan, (Fairfax, Virginia: Federal Engineering, Inc., 2002,) pp. 18. Telephone Multi-line phones are seen in many dispatching facilities. Rotary dials are rare.A method used for telephone traffic analysis may fit some circumstances. One evaluation looked at 1) peak of busy hour usage, 2) average hourly usage, 3) message length in seconds, 4) maximum delay or wait time desirable, and; 5) maximum percent of users being delayed. Traffic analysis can be applied to radio or telephone communications.For one example, see: \\"3.2.10.1 Current System Problems,\\" Trunked Radio System: Request For Proposals, (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma: Oklahoma City Municipal Facilities Authority, Public Safety Capital Projects Office, 2000) pp. 89-90. Most office telephone systems have some facility for recording calling volumes, and incoming call timing. Dispatch centers use Automatic call distribution (ACD) groups which can be evaluated for metrics such as average wait time, abandoned calls, and calls per hour.

In dispatching, US emergency medical services literature suggests that telephone calls to a dispatching facility should be answered in the first few rings. One document suggests emergency calls to dispatch should result in busy signals once per 100 calls during the busiest hour.\\"Introduction: EMS Communications,\\" Planning Emergency Medical Communications: Volume 2, Regional-level Planning Guide, (Washington, DC: Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 1995) pp. 11. In business call centers, similar standards are suggested by consultants in order to provide an ideal customer experience and to outperform competing services.See InTelegy customer service web site (ibid) for more information on call metrics. Sufficient staffing should be in place so that 90% of emergency calls are, \\"...answered within 10 seconds, or with no greater than three rings, during the average busy hour,\\" according to one source.\\"Introduction: EMS Communications,\\" Planning Emergency Medical Communications: Volume 2, Regional-level Planning Guide, (Washington, DC: Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 1995) pp. 11. For a discussion of telephone traffic statistics and busy hours, see: American Telephone and Telegraph Company, Basic Traffic Analysis, . Tolerable wait times vary from one culture and region to another: some cultures expect immediate service; others will tolerate waits for some services. Regardless of sector or industry, almost all dispatchers will spend virtually their entire work day on the phone, answering as many as a thousand calls in a single shift while multi tasking other aspects of the job. In many ways, being a dispatcher is really one person doing the work of three or four people. It consistently ranks as among the most stressful jobs in the industrialized world, with high blood pressure, fatigue, obesity, heart disease, and other stress/sedentary related health concerns existing at rates up to ten times the norm of any other occupation. Zone system to assign service calls Denver RTD, a transit service provider in a US city. Drawing at right illustrates the controls associated with a single channel on the console. Photos courtesy of US Department of Transportation. One method for organizing assignments in a manual dispatch system is to use a zone map system. Consider a community with four fire stations and two ambulance service providers. A grid is overlaid on a community map. Saint Proximal Medical Center ambulance is identified by the notation P while Distal Volunteer Rescue Squad is noted with a D. Each zone of the grid is identified with a progression of ambulance zones and fire stations.This would work for any system including taxis or parcel pick up. One zone might be labeled: DP241. This means fire station 2, then 4, then 1, then 3 would respond to a fire call occurring inside this zone. If fire stations 2, 4, and 1 were assigned to calls, Station 3 would be sent to this zone. Distal Volunteer Rescue Squad would be first-up for an ambulance call occurring inside zone DP241. The predefined order is created by persons with expertise in the service being provided, local geography, traffic, and patterns in calls for service. In assigning resources to a zone, decision-makers may consider that responding units must drive around freeways, lakes, or terrain obstructions in order to reach a zone. Zone boundaries and designations will periodically change as communities grow or lessons are learned during day-to-day operations. Consider a zone with an irrigation canal defining one boundary. If a car crashes into the canal, which zone is it in? Zone systems may include standby, move-up, or backfill points. For example, taxi drivers working in a certain zone in the evening hours may expect night club patrons to need a ride. Consider a standby point at Main Street and Railroad Avenue named N. Some fares will come from radio calls to dispatch. A taxi driver, Car 4, may go to predefined standby location N. In some dispatching systems, the driver will call the dispatcher and report they are available and located at standby point N. The dispatcher may respond by reporting the driver's position in the queue, \\"Car 4, second N.\\" The first call in this district would go to the driver ahead of Car 4. Car 4 would be assigned the second call. If automatic vehicle location is available, it would display service vehicle locations on a map. The closest unit would be interpreted by the dispatcher looking at vehicle locations projected on the map.

WBNW's flagship program, The Financial Exchange, is syndicated to several other stations in New England through the Money Matters Radio Network. Recently talk hosts Michael Graham, Don Imus, and John Batchelor were added to the lineup. History The station first took to the air August 28, 1989 as WADN, with a folk music format. (subscription content preview) Much of the station's staff had previously worked at an earlier Boston-area folk music station, WCAS (740 AM, now WJIB). Original owner Walden Communications Company sold the station to Assabet Communications Corporation on June 4, 1993. Shortly after the original WBNW (590 AM) was acquired by Salem Communications and became religious station WEZE in December 1996, WADN announced that it would begin carrying some Bloomberg Radio programming; by the end of the month, the folk format was moved to weekends only to accommodate the business and talk programming, and in April 1997 folk was dropped entirely. Money Matters Radio bought WADN in 1998; it had produced the station's morning show, also simulcast on WPLM (1390 AM) in Plymouth, WNRB (1510 AM, now WMEX) in Boston, and Attleboro-based WARA (1320 AM), since 1997.

Most accounts of World War II describing the Battle of the Bulge focus on the attack by the Germans around the Siege of Bastogne and the Battle of St. Vith, while the Germans' primary ambitions were actually anchored in taking the Losheim Gap. In this region of the border between Belgium and Germany, it is the only region conducive to military movement. In 1944, \\"Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein\\" (Operation Watch on the Rhine) was planned by Hitler to trade space for time by an attack which would advance through the Allied armies to Antwerp. This would be through \\"the Ardennes, a region that had long fascinated Hitler, where German armies had attacked with tremendous success in 1914 and again, at Hitler‚Äôs personal instigation, in 1940 .... (but not also, as is often erroneously remarked, in 1870. That advance was from the Saar-Palatinate through the Wissembourg Gap into Alsace)\\".  Strategic importance  During 1940 when the Germans invaded Belgium and then France, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel‚Äôs division sped through the Losheim Gap to gain the Meuse River and then push onto the English Channel. Hitler held similar hopes for 1944.  Battle of the Schnee Eifel  On 15 September 1944 the U.S. 8th Infantry Regiment attached to 4th Division of V Corps was directed by division commander General Barton to advance from the border village of Schoenberg along the valley of the upper Our river. However, they didn't succeed because of multiple factors, hitting definite resistance first at the approaches to Losheim and later near the village of Roth.  During the Battle of the Bulge  During the Battle of the Bulge, some of the best German units, including the 3rd Fallschirmjaeger Division and Sixth Panzer Army planned to assault northwest over the Losheim- Losheimergraben road and along the railroad tracks through the Losheim Gap in force towards the twin villages of Rocherath and Krinkelt but were held up by the broken railroad overpasses. Led by the 1st SS Panzer division, they planned to attack the 2nd and 99th Infantry Divisions with the goal of capturing Losheimergraben and gaining access to the vital road network to its north and west that would allow them to capture the important port of Antwerp. In a calculated risk, the Allies had only a few troops stretched very thinly across a wide area. Lanzerath, a village of about 15 homes, lay about to the west of Losheim. It was on the border between U.S. VIII Corps to the south and U.S. V Corps. It was held by a single Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon of 18 men and Task Force X, a tank destroyer platoon of 55 men. The German forces were located on the eastern edge of the Losheim Gap in Losheim and further east. The Siegfried Line between them divided the Losheim Gap. Dietrich's plan was for the 6th SS Panzer Army to advance east through Lanzerath and Bucholz Station and then drive through Honsfield and B√ºllingen. The infantry would continue north through Losheimergraben to push the 2nd and 99th Divisions out of the way. This would allow the 12th SS Panzer Division to advance eastward towards a group of villages named Trois-Ponts, connect to Belgian Route Nationale N-23, and cross the River Meuse. It was then another to Antwerp. During their earlier retreat, the Germans had destroyed two key railroad overpasses which they planned to repair on the first day of the counterattack. Unable to quickly repair the railroad bridge, the units advanced instead into Lanzerath. In a day-long battle, they took dozens of casualties and were held up by the 18 remaining US troops dug into a ridge overlooking the village, and the 6th Panzer Army advance was delayed. On December 17, German engineers repaired one of the road bridges over the railroad along the Losheim-Losheimergraben road and the 12th Division German armor began advancing towards the key road junction at Losheimergraben. Once past Lanzerath, the Germans plan to capture the good quality road network was thwarted by mostly untried U.S. troops who succeeded in severely limiting the German's advance, halting them at Elsenborn Ridge. The Germans were forced to reroute their armor and troops to the south over mostly single-lane country roads, severely limiting the speed of their advance and their ability to concentrate their strength on the limited American defenses. In the south, the 5th Panzer Army was given the task of capturing St. Vith and the vital road and rail network it controlled. The 18th Volksgrenadier Division under the command of Generalmajor G√ºnther Hoffmann-Sch√∂nborn patrolled the Schnee Eifel area. On December 16 at 4:00 a.m., they took the twenty-two foot macadam road route following the Our River valley towards Manderfield. The route terminated at several vital crossroads in the city of St. Vith. The 5th Panzer Army planned to bypass St. Vith to the north. Advance delayed The northern shoulder of the Battle of the Bulge, in which Bouck's unit held up the German advance through a key intersection near Lanzerath for nearly a full day. On the German side of the Siegfried Line, the Germans positioned their troops and armor around and to the east of the village of Losheim. On December 16, 1944, at 5:30 a.m., the Germans launched a 90-minute artillery barrage using 1,600 artillery pieces across an front. The infantry of the 9th Fallschirmjaeger Regiment, 3rd Fallschirmjaeger Division led the way through the Losheim Gap, tasked with clearing American resistance along the main line of advance. To spare the armor, they operated in advance of Kampfgruppe SS Standartenf√ºhrer Joachim Peiper's 1st SS Panzer Division, the spearhead of SS Oberstgruppenf√ºhrer Sepp Dietrich‚Äôs Sixth Panzer Army. The infantry would then secure the right flank of the attack route near Losheimergraben. The 12th Volksgrenadier Division reached Losheimgraben at 7:00 a.m. East of Losheim, Kampfgruppe Peiper expected to reach Losheimgraben by 8:00 a.m., but the tanks were held up for most of the morning of December 16 on the Blankenheim-Schnied road which was congested with horse-drawn artillery, infantrymen, and numerous other vehicles. Peiper himself tried to sort out the mess at one crossroads. For unknown reasons German engineers did not begin repairing the first of the railroad overpasses on the Losheim-Losheimergraben road until nearly noon, and the second was not repaired until December 17. When Peiper got word that the overpass would not be repaired in time for his advance, he chose to move west through Lanzerath. He was frustrated and angry that the 9th Fallschirmjaeger Regiment had yet to report that the road was clear. The 500 troops of the 1st Battalion, 9th Fallschirmjaeger Regiment, 3rd Fallschirmjaeger Division were held up for most of the day by 18 men of the 394th Intelligence and Reconnaissance Squads of the 99th Infantry Division at Lanzerath Ridge. At 6:00 pm, Peiper finally learned that the village had been secured. His column of 117 tanks, 149 half-tracks, 18 105mm guns and 6 150mm guns, totaling 600 vehicles, finally moved forward. He was further held up when his tanks struck two of their own minefields, slowing progress while the engineers cleared the fields ahead of mines. Peiper finally arrived in Lanzerath near midnight only to find the infantry bedding down for the night. Every officer he spoke to said the woods were full of Americans and tanks. He furiously interrogated the infantry officers to learn if any patrols into the woods had been conducted and learned that no one had personally reconnoitered the area. Disgusted, Peiper demanded that Oberst Helmut von Hoffman, commander of the 9th Parachute Regiment, give him a battalion of paratroops to accompany his tanks. At 4:30 a.m. on December 17, more than 16 hours behind schedule, the 1st SS Panzer Division rolled out of Lanzerath with a battalion of paratroopers preceding them and headed east for Bucholz Station. Advance towards H√ºnningen At Bucholz Station, the 3rd Battalion of the U.S. 394th Infantry Regiment was surprised and quickly captured, except for a headquarters company radio operator. Hidden in a cellar, he called in reports to division headquarters until he was finally captured. Driving west-northwest, the Germans entered Honsfeld, where they encountered one of the 99th Division's rest centers, clogged with confused American troops. They killed many and destroyed a number of American armored units and vehicles. Peiper easily captured the town and of fuel for his vehicles. He then advanced towards B√ºllingen, keeping to the plan to move west, apparently unaware he had nearly taken the town and unknowingly bypassing an opportunity to flank and trap the entire 2nd and 99th Division. Peiper suddenly turned south to detour around H√ºnningen, interested only in getting back onto his assigned Rollbahn. Kampfgruppe Peiper a few days later gained notoriety for their murder of U.S. prisoners of war in what became known as the Malmedy massacre. Losheimergraben attack Losheimergraben GermanyThe task of defeating the 99th Division was the objective of 12th SS Panzer Division reinforced by additional Panzergrenadier and Volksgenadier divisions. On December 17, German engineers repaired one of the road bridges over the railroad along the Losheim-Losheimergraben road and the 12th Division German armor began advancing towards the key road junction at Losheimergraben and the twin villages of Rocherath and Krinkelt. However, in more than ten days of intense battle, they were unable to dislodge the Americans from Elsenborn Ridge, where elements of the V Corps of the First U.S. Army prevented the German forces from reaching the road network to their west. The German advance never recovered from its initial delay, and the Sixth Panzer Army only got as far as La Gleize before its advance stalled out, advancing less than half-way to the River Meuse. The remaining soldiers were left to find their own way back to the east.

It is a soft green powder, which is insoluble in water.. It is a bright, high intensity colour used in oil and acrylic based artist's paints, and in other applications. Synthesis, properties, and production Phthalocyanine green is derived from phthalocyanine blue by chlorination in the presence of aluminium trichloride. The stoichiometry for the complete chlorination is shown: :Cu(C32H16N8) + 16 Cl2 ‚Üí Cu(C32N8Cl16) + 16 HCl In practice, this pigment is a mixture of isomers and degrees of chlorination. The 15th and 16th chlorides are difficult to install. The chemical formula usually ranges from C32H3Cl13CuN8 to C32HCl15CuN8. Due to the presence of strongly electronegative chlorine substituents, the absorption spectrum is shifted from that of the parent copper phthalocyanine. Phthalo green is highly stable and resistant to alkali, acids, solvents, heat, and ultraviolet radiation. Uses Due to its stability, phthalo green is used in inks, coatings, and many plastics. In application it is transparent. Being insoluble, it has no tendency to migrate in the material. It is a standard pigment used in printing ink and packaging industry. It is also allowed in all cosmetics except those used around the eyes. It is used in some tattoos. Related compounds Copper phthalocyanine green 36 is a variant where some of the chlorine atoms are replaced with bromine. Bromination is less efficient than chlorination.

Retrieved on 21 October 2007. is an American pinball and video game designer holding the record for best-selling pinball designer in history, and has been called \\"The Master of Flow\\" by pinball aficionados due to the emphasis in his designs on ball speed, loops, and long smooth shots. As of 2017, Ritchie suffers from Meniere's Disease and has had his hearing slowly reduced over the years. Steve is the older brother of fellow pinball designer Mark Ritchie. The Atari years After serving a stint in Vietnam and Alaska in the United States Coast Guard from 1968-1972, Ritchie joined Atari Inc. in 1974 and was employee number fifty and first worked on the assembly line as an electro-mechanical technician. Two years later, he was promoted to work at their fledgling pinball division, where he worked on his first game, Airborne Avenger. Ritchie earned the license to make a Superman pinball based on the Superman comic book, but in the final stages of production of the table, he received an offer from Williams Electronics, a major pinball company, that Ritchie could not refuse. The Williams years Ritchie moved to Chicago, Illinois, the home of Williams' headquarters. His first game for the company, Flash (released in 1979), was noted for its revolutionary figure-8 design and the first pinball game to feature bright Flash Lamps. It would go on to be his best-selling pinball game, having sold 19,505 units. 1980 would be the year for Ritchie, when he designed Firepower (the first electronic pinball to feature multi-ball, as well as Lane Change), and eight months later, he designed Black Knight, which was noted for having the first two-level playfield and the patented \\"Magna-Save\\" feature (in which magnets help prevent outlane drains). After 1981's Hyperball, Ritchie took a break from designing pinball games to design video games at his newly formed company, King Video Design. Devastator was the first 68000 microprocessor video game and it was a spectacular 3D flying-shooting game with remarkable graphics. Ritchie pioneered automated conversion of video-taped color images into objects in the video game system. After that, he returned to pinball with 1986's High Speed, which was based on a true story about him being chased by the police in his Porsche. High Speed's bill of materials was higher than other games, and some rival Williams designers nicknamed it \\"High Cost\\". The cost increase was minimal, and the game sold 17,080 units. It was the major title that revitalized the entire pinball market. After that, he released F-14 Tomcat in 1987, and in 1989, he released the sequel to 1980's Black Knight, Black Knight 2000, which was acclaimed for having perhaps one of the best musical soundtracks ever for a pinball game (composed by himself, Brian L. Schmidt, and Dan Forden). It was also one of the first games to feature a \\"Wizard Mode\\", called \\"The King's Ransom\\". Next up was Rollergames (based on the TV show of the same name which was cancelled well before game production), it was a game with a loud and rowdy soundtrack and the first solid state game to feature mainstream advertising. Ritchie designed Terminator 2: Judgment Day, which featured the voice and likeness of Arnold Schwarzenegger. T2 was the first game by Williams to use a dot-matrix display (although Bally's Gilligan's Island beat it to the market, because T2 had a longer production schedule, and management at Williams felt that other games needed it first.) After T2, he designed The Getaway: High Speed II in 1992, a sequel to 1986's High Speed. In 1993, Ritchie released a widebody game, Star Trek: The Next Generation, which many pinball fans consider to be Ritchie's best game. For the game, Ritchie enlisted the entire cast of TNG, including Patrick Stewart, Michael Dorn, and Jonathan Frakes to reprise their roles. The game would sell 11,728 units. It was the last pinball machine to sell in the 5-digits. After he was finished with 1995's No Fear: Dangerous Sports, Ritchie left Williams, feeling that he could better serve Williams/Bally/Midway by producing video games at the newly acquired Atari Games. 1996 was the beginning of the decline of pinball with gradually diminishing sales, eventually leading to the extinction of all pinball manufacturers except Stern Pinball. Video games and other contributions Steve Ritchie returned to Atari Games in 1996 as a senior staff producer. There, he would design and produce the racing game California Speed, which sold 7,856 units for total sales of about $40 million, on a budget of $2 million, with a crew of 16 video programmers and artists. Ritchie is also known to be an avid fan of PC games, motocross racing, and a dedicated dirt and street motorcyclist as well. He was also on the design team for Williams' Defender. He was a voice actor for many of his own games, as well as Williams and Midway's video games. He is best known for playing the voice of Shao Kahn in the Mortal Kombat series (MKII, MK3, UMK3, MKT, MK:SM), along with coming up with the name of Mortal Kombat, which was just called 'Combat' before his suggestion.Arcade and Flipper Pinball Review (December 2001 & March 2002 issues) Ritchie was also the voice of the Black Knight in both Black Knight and Black Knight 2000, the Demon in No Fear, the announcer in Midway's High Impact Football, the monotoned voice of Firepower, and other small parts in many Williams, Midway and Stern games. The Stern years After designing and selling a few redemption games, he formed Steve Ritchie Productions (SRP) in 2002, and returned to pinball design contracting with Stern Pinball to distribute his games. For his first game for Stern, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, he once again enlisted Arnold Schwarzenegger to lend his voice and likeness to the game, and also re- assembled the same team who worked with him on the T2 pinball, including software programmer Dwight Sullivan and music composer Chris Granner. After T3, Ritchie released Elvis, which was released in time for the 50th anniversary of Elvis Presley's first song recording. Ritchie's third game for Stern was World Poker Tour. World Poker Tour was the first game to use Stern's new hardware, S.A.M., which is the successor to their older Whitestar platform. He has recently revealed in an interview that he was forced by Gary Stern to design the game. After completing 24, a pinball machine based on the TV series of the same name, Ritchie was laid off from Stern along with most of the company's other pinball designers. A March 3, 2011 press release from Stern reported that Steve had returned to Stern to design the next generation of pinball machines. His first game released after returning to Stern was AC/DC. In March 2012, Ritchie conducted a comprehensive audio interview with Music Life Radio about his life and career, with focus on the AC/DC pinball game. In September 2013, Stern announced Ritchie's newest pinball game, Star Trek, based on the current line of movies. In March 2019, Stern announced the upcoming release of another pinball machine designed by Ritchie, Black Knight: Sword of Rage.

It could also be argued that Conn Bacach had taken the title Earl of Tyrone in 1542, as part of the process of surrender and regrant, and in the process had waived his title. Whether he could waive it without consulting his clan derbfine is part of this debate. Conn Bacach's grandson Hugh was not proclaimed king at Tullyhogue in 1593, but assumed the title after arranging to pay Turlough Luineach an annuity.

He had previously been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Highlands and Islands region from 1999 until 2016.  Early life and career  McGrigor was born in London in 1949 and educated at Cladich Primary School in Argyll and privately at Eton College. He studied Commercial French at the University of Neuch√¢tel in Switzerland. After graduating, he worked in finance in the City of London and in the shipping sector in Glasgow. He also farmed sheep and cattle, and started a trout farm in Argyll in the early 1970s. Political career McGrigor stood unsuccessfully for the Western Isles in the 1997 general election. He fought Argyll and Bute in 2005, finishing second, and fought the equivalent seat in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, finishing third. He served as Scottish Conservative spokesperson for fisheries, and communities and sport. He is also an Honorary Vice-President of English-Speaking Union Scotland. McGrigor was also the driving force behind the establishment of the Scottish Register of Tartans. His Member's Bill was given support by the Scottish Government and was subsequently passed by the Scottish Parliament on 9 October 2008. This makes McGrigor one of the first MSPs to have passed a Private Member's Bill through the Scottish Parliament. In 2017, he stood in the Argyll and Bute Council election and was elected to the Oban South and the Isles ward.

Founded in 1952 as Four Star Productions by prominent Hollywood actors Dick Powell, David Niven, Charles Boyer, and Joel McCrea, it was inspired by Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz founding Desilu Productions a year earlier. McCrea left soon after its founding to continue in films, television and radio, and was replaced by Ida Lupino as the fourth star‚Äîalthough Lupino did not own stock in the company. Four Star produced several popular programs in the early days of television, including Four Star Playhouse (its first series), Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre, Stagecoach West, The June Allyson Show (also known as The DuPont Show Starring June Allyson), The Dick Powell Show, Burke's Law, The Rogues and The Big Valley. Despite its stars sharing equal billing, Powell played the biggest role in the company's early success and growth. Powell became President of Four Star within a few years of its formation and, in 1955, Four Star Films, Inc. was formed as an affiliate which produced such hit shows as The Rifleman; Trackdown; Wanted: Dead or Alive; Richard Diamond, Private Detective and The Detectives Starring Robert Taylor. There were also failed series, like Jeannie Carson's Hey, Jeannie! In late 1958, Four Star Productions and Four Star Films were merged into a new holding company called Four Star Television, and began publicly trading on the American Stock Exchange on January 12, 1959. After Powell's death Four Star was led by Thomas McDermott, followed by Aaron Spelling. It was then purchased and developed for global film and television markets by David Charnay, and subsequently was sold to Ron Perelman; Perelman sold it to 20th Century Fox Television in 1996. History=Dick Powell Dick Powell, a Hollywood veteran of twenty years in 1952, longed to produce and direct. While he did have some opportunities to do so, such as RKO Radio Pictures' The Conqueror (1956) with John Wayne, Powell saw greater opportunities offered by the then-infant medium of television. Four Star Playhouse Powell came up with an idea for an anthology series, with a rotation of established stars every week, four stars in all. The stars would own the studio and the program, as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz had done successfully with the Desilu studio. Powell had intended for the program to feature himself, Charles Boyer, Joel McCrea and Rosalind Russell; however, Russell and McCrea backed out, and David Niven came on board as the \\"third star\\". The fourth star would be a guest star at first. CBS liked the idea, and Four Star Playhouse made its debut in the fall of 1952. While it ran on alternate weeks during its first season (the program it alternated with was the television version of Amos 'n' Andy), it was successful enough to be renewed and become a weekly program beginning with the second season and until the end of its run in 1956. Actress/director Ida Lupino was brought on board as the pro forma fourth star, though unlike Powell, Boyer, and Niven, she owned no stock in the company. Westerns Following the cancellation of Four Star Playhouse, two new programs came on CBS: a comedy called Hey, Jeannie! which starred Jeannie Carson, and a western anthology show Zane Grey Theater, more formally named Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater. Carson's show ran for just a season, but Zane Grey Theater ran for four. It hosted the pilot episodes for Trackdown starring Robert Culp (which in turn hosted a pilot for Wanted: Dead or Alive with Steve McQueen), The Westerner with Brian Keith, Black Saddle with Peter Breck and Russell Johnson and The Rifleman. Richard Diamond, Private Detective In 1957 it debuted the first of its many police/detective shows, Richard Diamond, Private Detective. The \\"Diamond\\" series was originally created for radio by Blake Edwards, and the character played by Powell, but Edwards, with Powell's approval, recast the character with the then-unknown Clark Gable-lookalike David Janssen. Other crime series by Four Star included Target: The Corruptors! with Stephen McNally and Robert Harland, The Detectives starring Robert Taylor, Burke's Law starring Gene Barry, and Honey West starring Anne Francis and John Ericson. The Rogues Another program, The Rogues, starred Boyer and Niven with Gig Young. This was (after Four Star Playhouse) the closest the studio's owners would come to appearing on the same program. The idea was for the three actors to alternate as the lead each week playing moral con-man cousins out to fleece reprehensible villains, often with one or two of the others turning up to play a small part in the caper (real ensemble episodes were rare). The schedule of who pulled leading man duty was largely determined by the actors' movie commitments, thereby giving Niven, Boyer, and Young additional work between film roles. In any event, Young wound up helming most of the episodes since he usually had more spare time than Niven or Boyer, but even he had to be replaced by Larry Hagman as another cousin for two episodes when Young was too busy. The series only lasted through the 1964-65 season. A powerhouse Hollywood launching pad The studio was successful in the late 1950s as a result of the success of its programs. Four Star also helped bring some prominent names in television and movies to public attention including David Janssen, Steve McQueen, Robert Culp, Chuck Connors, Mary Tyler Moore, Linda Evans, Jeannie Carson, Lee Majors, The Smothers Brothers, Aaron Spelling, Dick Powell, David Niven, Joel McCrea, Charles Boyer, Ida Lupino and Sam Peckinpah. The studio was well known as being sympathetic to creative staff. Powell often battled with network executives on behalf of writers, directors, and actors. Dick Powell's death, Aaron Spelling's Exit On January 2, 1963, a day after his last appearance on his program The Dick Powell Show aired, Dick Powell died of stomach cancer. The stomach cancer was likely a result of having directed Howard Hughes's The Conqueror, amidst dust clouds of atomic test radiation in Utah. Out of a cast and crew of 220 people, 91 contracted various forms of organ cancers by 1981, including stars John Wayne and Agnes Moorehead. An ad executive named Thomas McDermott was brought in to run the studio for Niven, Boyer, and Powell's family. But without Powell's vision, the studio went into a period of decline. Within two years after Powell's death, Four Star had decreased to only five programs on the air. After another two years, all but one; The Big Valley was gone. Aaron Spelling began his career at Four Star Television as a staff writer and after a number of hits began producing television shows for Four Star. Spelling left the studio in 1966 to form his own production company with Danny Thomas, Thomas Spelling Productions. For a brief time, Four Star Television owned Valiant Records, but sold the label to Warner Bros. Records in 1966, shortly after pop group The Association released their first records for the label. Early copies of the album And Then... Along Comes the Association show the Four Star disclaimer blacked out at the bottom of the label. David Charnay's Acquisition From 1967 to 1989, David Charnay was the leader of a buyout group that owned a controlling interest in Four Star Television and subsequently renamed the television company: Four Star International. For more than two decades, he served as President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Four Star. He directed the company, employing his only son, John Charnay as Director of Public Relations, as well as employing many of Hollywood's leading producers, stars, and executives of the late 20th and early 21st century, including Deke Heyward, Morey Amsterdam, Dick Colbert, Tony Thomopoulos, and collaborating with Aaron Spelling and George Spota for continued film and television projects, as well as many Hollywood stars and starlets before many producers advanced to create their own companies. Four Star amassed a sizable inventory of programs for syndication, then the world's largest syndication company. Charnay led a turnaround in Four Star that involved both vertical integration and horizontal integration, which developed the company into a global powerhouse syndicator of its large collection of shows that included: The Rifleman, Wanted: Dead or Alive, The Rogues, Zane Grey (Original Title: \\"Zane Grey Theater\\") and The Big Valley. While it did get a hit of sorts in producing a show called Thrill Seekers, (which was a sort of proto-reality TV program, and the first reality show in the United States), the studio's primary niche was in its successful syndication to global film and television audiences. Final Acquisitions: Robert Seidenglanz, Ronald Perelman and Rupert Murdoch David Charnay sold Four Star to Robert Seidenglanz's Compact Video Systems in 1989 which was then owned by Ronald Perelman. After Compact Video shut down, its remaining assets, including Four Star, were folded into majority shareholder Ronald Perelman's MacAndrews and Forbes Incorporated. In 1989, Perelman acquired New World Entertainment and Four Star became a division of New World. After Four Star International became part of New World, Four Star operated as in-name-only. In 1993, Four Star acquired 50% of Genesis Entertainment. As part of the acquisition, Genesis acquired television distribution rights of Four Star's 160 feature films and television series.\\"LA Times\\"Four Star Acquires 50% of Genesis Entertainment articles.latimes.com, Retrieved on 12 June 2016 Four Star International is now owned by The Walt Disney Company, with most of its library of programs controlled by 20th Century Fox Television as a result of the buyout between Rupert Murdoch and Ron Perelman in 1996.https://images-na.ssl-images- amazon.com/images/I/513CKT1MCTL.jpghttp://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-92526318.html  Four Star International's Asset Diversification  With the subsequent sale of New World to 20th Century Fox (now owned by The Walt Disney Company) in 1997, the Four Star catalogue is now owned by 20th Television, one of Disney's TV distribution units, with a few exceptions: * The Rifleman, which is now owned by its original co-production company Levy-Gardner-Laven Productions, and whose TV distribution rights are handled by the Peter Rodgers Organization * Trackdown, which was co-produced with CBS, is now owned and distributed by CBS Television Distribution. * Wanted Dead or Alive, which was also co-produced with CBS, now has its worldwide distribution rights handled by StudioCanal.

Vallila is a central-northern neighbourhood, bordered by Pasila to the west and Alppiharju to the south. Like Kallio, Vallila is mostly residential and has a reputation of being a working-class neighbourhood. In the past two decades people from artistic professions have found the area. Vallila though still retains its roots from 1910s to 1980s by being one of the rare neighbourhoods which still has an industrial area and abundant amount of workshop businesses. Because of gentrification Vallila is nowadays considered a trendy area in Helsinki (like Kallio) among young adults and housing is expensive, particularly in Puu-Vallila. Several major companies, such as S Group, Telia Finland, OP Financial Group and Nordea, have their headquarters in Vallila. Vallila is famous for its many old wooden houses dating back to the 1900s‚Äì1920s, which are spread over many blocks. Many buildings by the main streets are fine examples of Nordic Classicism from the 1920s‚Äì1930s. It is located closest to the city center of all the wooden-house residential areas in Helsinki. This area is called Puu-Vallila (Wooden Vallila). Puu-Vallila was built 1910, while the rest of Vallila was built in the 1920s and 1930s. Before this Vallila was a villa area for wealthy people living in Helsinki centre. Perhaps the most famous scene in Vallila is the small flea market square featured in Aki Kaurism√§ki's film The Man Without a Past. Ville Valo, lead singer for the Finnish band HIM, was born in Vallila. Vallila is also the name of a basic city administrative district. It includes both Vallila and Hermanni neighbourhoods and has 12300 inhabitants (1.1.2010). Vallila itself has 7800 inhabitants.

It presents an international opera repertoire, together with home-grown favorites.Fodor's Bangkok 25 Best, p. 90 (2015). The company was founded in 2001, as a production company to mount Madana, the first full-length grand opera by Thai composer S. P. Somtow. This production featured in the title role the American soprano Stacey Tappan. In 2002, with Somtow as artistic director, the Bangkok Opera began a series of productions, the first being Purcell's Dido and Aeneas. The series then moved onto larger-scale works such as Mae Naak, The Magic Flute, and Turandot. At the end of 2005 the Bangkok Opera declared its first \\"complete\\" season and also started a five-year project to perform the complete Wagner's Ring Cycle. Its resident orchestra is the Siam Philharmonic Orchestra and its resident chorus is the Orpheus Choir of Bangkok.Turnbull, Robert. \\"Thai Impresario Prepares A 'Ring' With a Difference\\", The New York Times (April 18, 2006). The company performs regularly at the Thailand Cultural Centre, and at other venues in Bangkok. Somtow says the Bangkok Opera was set up based on the idea that, \\"nothing important has ever happened in art when an audience has been ready for it.\\" He says the opera caters to three groups: expatriates, high society, and other Thais who love opera. He seeks to bring all three groups under one roof. In 2013 Opera Siam International premiered S. P. Somtow's ballet-opera Suriyothai in honour of the birthday of Queen Sirikit. It starred Stacey Tappan and Winita Lohitkul, and was conducted by Trisdee na Patalung.

He was born in Lincoln, Nebraska and after growing up and going to college in Wichita, Kansas he enlisted in the Army. He was sent to Europe to fight in World War II and was killed in the Battle of the Bulge after killing approximately 100 German soldiers. It was for this action that he received the Medal of Honor, which was presented to his family by President Harry Truman at a White House ceremony. Early life and education Cowan was born December 5, 1922 in Lincoln, Nebraska but grew up in Wichita, Kansas. After attending school in Wichita he transferred from Friends University in Wichita, Kansas, his hometown, to Oberlin College, in October 1942. His father, grandfather, and uncles were all graduates of Oberlin College, and his greatest wish was to be the third Cowan generation at Oberlin. Military career Cowan joined the Army from his hometown of Wichita, Kansas in September 1943.WWII Army Enlistment Records At the time of his death, Cowan was a 22-year-old private first class in M Company, 23rd Infantry, Second Infantry Division. On December 17, 1944, the second day of the Battle of the Bulge, the last great German effort to split the Allied front and reach the English Channel, he was a heavy machine gunner attached to I Company near Krinkelter Wald, Belgium. The company was attacked by a superior force of Wehrmacht infantry and tanks. Cowan and his comrades repulsed the first six waves of attacking German infantry, but a seventh drive with tanks killed or wounded all but three of his section, leaving Dick to man his gun supported by only 15 or 20 riflemen. He stood his ground, holding off the Germans until the rest of his force could set up a new line behind him. Then, unaided, he moved his heavy weapon and ammunition to the second position. A King Tiger tank approached, but he held his fire until 80 or so supporting German infantry broke cover. His first burst of fire killed or wounded half of them. The tank fired its 88 mm cannon, rocking his position. He continued to man his gun, pouring a deadly fire into the German ranks. Barely missed by another shell from the tank and fire from three German machine guns and a rocket, he stood by his gun. Finally, after he had killed an estimated one hundred of the enemy, his position became untenable. Cowan lifted the heavy gun on his back and escaped into the village of Krinkelt. Out of ammunition and too exhausted to carry the gun, he received permission to destroy it. He then picked up a rifle and joined other infantry in defending the town. He was killed by enemy fire the next day on December 17, 1944 and was buried in Wichita Park Cemetery, Wichita, Kansas. President Harry S. Truman gave Cowan's Medal of Honor to his parents in a ceremony on the White House lawn, marking their son's heroic exploits in the Ardennes campaign. Cowan is the only known Oberlin College recipient of the Medal of Honor. Medal of Honor citation Rank and organization: Private First Class, U.S. Army, Company M, 23d Infantry, 2d Infantry Division.

It lies east of Chew Valley Lake and north east of the Mendip Hills, approximately ten miles south of Bristol on the A368, Weston-super-Mare to Bath road between West Harptree and Chelwood. Bishop Sutton and the neighbouring village of Stowey form the civil parish of Stowey Sutton. The village has a large village hall, a public house (The Red Lion), an organic culinary school and bed and breakfast (Meadow View), a small supermarket, several shops including a Post Office within the village store, a tennis club and a caravan park. Next to the village hall are sports pitches where Bishop Sutton F.C. play. The lake is a popular place for children, adults and the elderly alike with beautiful views and entertainment such as fishing and sailing. There is a museum and tea shop on one side of the lake and a restaurant on the other. The main industry in the village was a coal mine owned by J. Lovell & Sons from 1835 to 1929, which was part of the Somerset coalfield. There was also a large flour mill, part of which was converted into flats.  History = Coal mining  Much of the exploratory survey work which identified the geology of the area was carried out by William Smith, who became known as the \\"Father of English Geology\\", building on earlier work in the same area by John Strachey, who lived at Sutton Court. The Pensford coal basin lies in the northern area of the Somerset coalfield around Bishop Sutton, Pensford, Stanton Drew, Farmborough and Hunstrete. The date for the first pits around Bishop Sutton are uncertain but there was at least one before 1719. By 1824 a collection of four bell pits were identified in field tithe No 1409, and four shaft pits in field tithe No 1428, but they were no longer working. The Old Pit (), which was also known as Sutton Top Pit or Upper Sutton Pit, was dug before 1799 and owned by Lieutenant Henry Fisher, who sold it in 1821 to Robert Blinman Dowling and several seams of coal were identified and exploited. After Dowling's death the Old Pit was sold to Mr. T.T. Hawkes in 1852, but he defaulted on the payments and it was sold in 1853 to William Rees-Mogg (an ancestor of William Rees-Mogg) and his associates. The shaft reached a depth of , but went out of production by 1855, when the \\"New\\" Pit which had been sunk in the early 19th century but then closed, was reopened and deepened to exploit deeper seams. The New Pit () had two shafts of diameter, one for winding and one for pumping. In 1896 it was owned by F. Spencer, New Rock Colliery, and in 1908 by Jesse Lovell and Sons. The pit finally closed in 1929.  Government and politics  Bishop Sutton, along with Stowey, makes up the Stowey Sutton Parish council, which has some responsibility for local issues and is part of the Chew Valley South Ward, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke District and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Clutton Rural District.A Vision of Britain Through Time : Clutton Rural District The parish falls within the 'Chew Valley South' electoral division. Bishop Sutton is the most populous area of the ward but this stretches north and west to Nempnett Thrubwell. The total population of the ward as at the 2011 census was 2,377. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It was also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.  Geography = Folly Farm  Folly Farm is a traditionally managed visitable farm and nature reserve run by the Avon Wildlife Trust. The farm house is 17th century and the surrounding land includes neutral grassland, flowery meadows and woodlands with splendid views. Much of Folly Farm is designated as a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. The SSSI comprises two adjacent areas, the meadows (19.36 hectares) and Dowlings Wood (9 hectares). The site is situated on a curved ridge of land on neutral soils derived from the underlying Keuper Marl. The soil is of the Icknield Association with dark brown, moist but moderately well-drained clay. It attracts a wide range of birds. The pasture is of a kind now rare in the area. A number of scarce species of fly are listed from the site.English Nature SSSI citation sheet Gibbs, David J.

Burledge Hill  Burledge Hill is on the southern edge of the village of Bishop Sutton. The site comprises a mixture of flower rich grassland, scrub and mature hedgerows. Three fields are designated as Burledge Sidelands and Meadows a Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI), and, since November 2005, as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) covering 48.7 ha. Burledge hillfort is a univallate Iron Age hillfort. The site was investigated three times: in 1955 by the University of Bristol Spelaeological Society and in 1959 and 1966 by field investigation. In 1955, the excavating archaeologists found evidence of post or stake holes, ditches, pits, and gullies inside the fort. They also found artifacts like a part of an iron fibula, animal bones, and pottery. One find which evidenced that metalworking was done at this site was the discovery of iron slag.  Demographics  According to the 2001 census, the Chew Valley South Ward (which includes Bishop Sutton and Stowey) had 1,222 residents, living in 476 households, with an average age of 40.3 years. Of these, 76% of residents described their health as 'good', 25% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no qualifications; and the area had an unemployment rate of 1.9% of all economically active people aged 16‚Äì74. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, it was ranked at 28,854 out of 32,482 wards in England, where 1 was the most deprived LSOA and 32,482 the least deprived.  Church  Church & Primary School The Church of the Holy Trinity in Wick Road is the Anglican parish church. The building dates from 1848 and is a Grade II listed building. During 2006 a grant of ¬£64,000 was received from English Heritage to replace the roof of the church. The village also possesses a Methodist Chapel that dates in part from the 1780s and it is thought that John Wesley the founder of Methodism may have preached there.  The Elms  The Elms on Sutton Hill Road is a detached house dating from the early 18th century which has Grade II listed building status.  Education  The village school has 115 pupils aged 4‚Äì11 years on the roll. It dates back to 1842 and was originally a school for pupils up to the age of 14. At one time it was a Church school but no longer has this status. The building today consists of the original Victorian school and three detached classrooms. After the age of 11, most pupils attend Chew Valley School  Sport and leisure  Bishop Sutton A.F.C. were officially established in 1977, although it is actually a reformed version of a club that dated from the early 1900s. Bishop Sutton joined the Western Football League in 1991 after playing in the Somerset County League and prior to that the Bristol and Avon League. A title in the 1997‚Äì98 season in Division One earned the club a promotion to the Premier Division, where they have played ever since. They reached the 3rd round of the FA Vase in the 1995-96 season, losing to AFC Lymington. There is also a tennis club in the village. In 2011, residents of Bishop Sutton and surrounding villages banded together to form a new charity, the Chew Valley Youth Trust, to combat the declining provision in leisure and recreational activities for young people in the region. In response to the closure of local Youth Clubs and declining state support for local transport, the charity combats issues of rural isolation and provides young residents with recreational activities.

Creasey published almost 60 Toff adventures, beginning with Introducing the Toff in 1938 and continuing through The Toff and the Crooked Copper, published in 1977, four years after the author's death. Rollison is in many ways similar to Simon Templar, although Creasey's other character The Baron bears an even closer resemblance. Unlike Templar, Rollison has no earlier life of crime, although he frequently breaks or bends the law in pursuing his investigations. Rollison's calling card includes a caricature of a toff‚Äîa line drawing with a top hat, monocle, bow-tie and cigarette with a holder. His flat includes a trophy wall, on which is a memento of every case Rollison helped to solve. In these stories Rollison is moderately well-known, as his exploits are frequently reported in the newspapers. He is as at home in upper-crust society circles as he is in the East End of London. Bibliography The Toff was introduced in the tuppenny weekly crime magazine The Thriller in 1933, while the first novel was published in 1938.

Although the settings of the stories keep up with the times, Rollison himself maintains an age of roughly 40 throughout. He is described as over six feet tall, with dark hair. Rollison's friends refer to him as Rolly, and acquaintances from the East End refer to him as \\"Mr. Ar\\". Jolly Jolly is Rollison's valet, as well as a partner is his investigations. He is described as dour and sad-looking, and is in every way the proper gentleman's gentleman. Superintendent William \\"Bill\\" Grice Superintendent Bill Grice of Scotland Yard shows respect for Rollison's abilities and contributions, but nonetheless complains about his methods. Grice bears a scar on his face from a case in which Rollison was involved. Richard Shuttleworth Shuttleworth owns the stables at the end of Shoreditch Lane. He also acts as Rollison's apprentice in many novels. Supporting characters= William \\"Bill\\" Ebbut Bill Ebbut is the proprietor of the Blue Dog Gymnasium, in which he trains fighters, and The Sailor's Arms public house. Ebbut frequently provides trustworthy men to act as guards or trail suspects. In The Toff and the Golden Boy, Ebbut is described as follows: : He had a big head, pendulous jowls, no neck to speak of, and a huge chest merging into a mammoth waist-line. All the time he breathed, he wheezed. Lady Gloria Hurst Lady Gloria Hurst is Rollison's aunt. Her home is the Marigold Club, where she takes in women requiring temporary assistance. She occasionally protects women involved in Rollison's adventures. Adaptations=Film Two Maclean Rogers films were made from Toff adventures in 1952: Salute the Toff and Hammer the Toff. The Toff was played by John Bentley in both films. Radio At least six early novels, namely Introducing the Toff, The Toff Steps Out, Here Comes the Toff, Salute the Toff, The Toff Proceeds, and The Toff Is Back, were adapted into a serial by Australia's Crawford Productions in the late 1940s. Robert Burnard starred as the Toff. Hundreds of episodes are kept in Australia's National Film and Sound Archive. Two other novels, The Toff and the Runaway Bride and The Toff on the Farm, were adapted into BBC Radio dramas starring Terence Alexander, in 1975 and 1977 respectively. Theatre The 1961 production The Toff by Salisbury Arts Theatre Limited, which debuted on 17th April 1961 at Salisbury Playhouse, starred Michael Johnson as the Toff. Comics A couple Super Detective Library comic books published by Amalgamated Press were adapted from Toff novels: The Toff at Butlin‚Äôs (#61) and The Missing Millionaire (#110, based on A Six for the Toff).

It features floats and live performers covered in thousands of electronically controlled lights and a synchronized soundtrack controlled by a Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) tone broadcast along the parade route. The parade was originally created for Tokyo Disneyland where it ran for six years from 1995 to 2001. An updated version of the Main Street Electrical Parade replaced Fantillusion at Tokyo Disneyland known as the Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade: DreamLights. Background and History The Disney's Fantillusion! parade premiered at Tokyo Disneyland on July 21, 1995 featured light, music, special effects and Disney characters. Created specifically for Tokyo Disneyland, Fantillusion! was developed by the team behind Fantasmic!, the show performed at Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios, with the aim of condensing the story of Fantasmic! and putting it into a parade format. The parade's score was orchestrated by Bruce Healey, the same composer behind Fantasmic!'s theme and the Music Director at Disneyland. The storyline of the parade is loosely based on the elements of Fantasmic!. The 31 floats were split in three acts. The parade starts with Tinkerbell, Mickey Mouse and the three fairies from Disney's Sleeping Beauty \\"wishing upon a star to bring the gift of Disney light\\" before being disrupted by Disney villains who \\"take the light and make it night\\", then ending with the Disney Heroes and Heroines who \\"turn the dark back into light\\". Fantasmic! features Mickey Mouse in combat with Disney villains. The three main villains of the show; Maleficent, Ursula and Jafar - Maleficent is the lead villain in both shows, whereas Ursula is the supporting villain at Disneyland as is Jafar at Disney's Hollywood Studios, are the three villains featured in Disney's Fantillusion!. Chernabog from Fantasia, and the Queen from Snow White, are also in the show. Disney's Fantillusion! was designed and built for the parade route of Tokyo Disneyland. Each act would enter one portion of the park's parade route and then halt for a \\"show stop\\". The parade would the progress to the next section and halt again for the next show stop. This ensured that every guest watching the parade could see all three acts of the story. After six years at Tokyo Disneyland, the parade closed at the end of its \\"Sayonara Disney's Fantillusion!\\" season on May 15, 2001. After the parade was closed, the floats which had been bought by Disneyland Paris were left outside in the harsh conditions of Tokyo by the Oriental Land Company, where they were left exposed to the elements before being packed and transported to Europe. The floats which had not been bought are thought to have been destroyed. Of the 31 floats in the Tokyo version of the parade, only 15 were brought to Disneyland Paris due to financial limitations. Of those 15, only thirteen floats were used in Disneyland Paris' original production of the parade. The two floats that were bought, but never used were the Nasty Grotto and Murkey Dungeon. These floats were initially utilized to train new drivers but have since found other uses in providing spare parts. Disneyland Paris also bought most of the original costumes used in Tokyo's production of the parade, but owing to electrical difficulties and European performers being larger than their Asian counterparts, these weren't utilised. New skirt-like costumes were fashioned for the Evil Villains sections as a replacement for the \\"Ghouls\\" costumes, and new Court Dancer costumes were created for the Happy Ending. The costuming crisis was also a defining reason for not using the two extra floats in the Evil Villains section - as Disneyland Paris didn't have the time/funds to create costumes for performers on board these floats. It took the floats more than 40 days to reach to Disneyland Paris from the Tokyo Disney Resort. They traveled by cargo ship from Japan to Australia, then set off again through the Suez canal and Mediterranean Sea before finally traveling around Spain and up the west coast of France to reach Le Havre. They were then taken by truck to Disneyland Paris where they were completely refurbished. The refurbishment of the parade floats took much longer than expected as the floats were badly damaged during transit. This meant that Disneyland Paris had to repair many of the floats, replace the thousands of tiny lightbulbs, convert their electrical system to the one used in Paris and enlarge the driving areas to fit the larger European drivers. \\"Disney's Fantillusion parade\\" was due to debut in Paris in 2002, when the Main Street Electrical Parade would have been running for ten years, but instead, because of the problems with the floats and the fact that Disneyland Paris still pushed emphasis on their newly opened Walt Disney Studios Park, Fantillusion had to wait another year for its Parisian debut. After many weeks of the parade rehearsing in Disneyland Park after park closing hours, there was a special Fantillusion preview night on June 28, 2003 for Annual Passport holders. The parade then premiered to the public at the start of its first Summer season in on July 5, 2003, running until August 31. Fantillusion returned for its first Christmas season in the resort from November 8 to January 4, and has been playing to crowds of fans and guests every Summer and Christmas season since. In Summer 2005, the \\"Bat Forest\\" float was removed from the parade in response to budget cuts and guest feedback. As the only villain float with no character or transformation effects, the float was no longer seen as an important part of the parade. However, the \\"Bat Forest\\" float returned every Halloween night, carrying Jack Skellington and Sally from The Nightmare Before Christmas. Disney's Christmas season in 2005 brought a further change to the parade, with the parade now running from Fantasyland to Town Square. While this brought with it a huge amount of technical troubles in the days after the switch, it allowed for better efficiency with the backstage parade preparation and meant guests would now follow the parade to the park's exit instead of back into the park. This change also meant that a maximum of two showstops are able to be viewed from any single location. At Disneyland Park, Le Ch√¢teau de la Belle au Bois Dormant was co-ordinated with the parade so it plays a part of the show and changes colour with the music, etc. In 2012 at the end of Disneyland Paris' summer season Fantillusion was put on a temporary hiatus. By then, the Disney Dreams! night-time show on Sleeping Beauty's Castle was showing nightly. It was announced that Fantillusion would not return for the Christmas season. No official confirmation has been given as to whether the parade has been axed or if it will return. The parade went out again on Halloween night, only the main floats with no floor performers for the guests who attended the Halloween event. It is currently unknown whether the Parade will return. Introductions The introduction to the parade at Tokyo Disneyland was notable for saying the line: \\"From out of the night, comes the Magic of light... As Tokyo Disneyland proudly presents: Disney's Fantillusion!\\". At Disneyland Paris, the introduction in both English and French is simply: \\"Mesdames et Messieurs et vous les enfants. Ladies and Gentlemen, Boys and Girls. Disneyland Park est d'heureux de vous presenter - proudly presents: the Disney's Fantillusion Parade!\\".

Truly unique costumes were created using 88 individual designs, 290 different fabrics, and 10 different light mediums including mini-lights and fiber optics. The costumes work together with the music, choreography, and lights to produce a fantastical, magical dream.http://www.mickey- mouse.com/tdlshowfantillusion.htm Tokyo Disneyland - Fantillusion Disneyland Paris Version Act 1 - Mickey's Magical Gardenhttp://www.dlrpmagic.com/guidebook/disneyland- park/entertainment/disneysfantillusion/ DLRP Magic - Fantillusion # Mickey's Fantillusion # Flora's Gazebo # Fauna's Carousel # Enchanted Butterfly Flower Act 2 - The Disney Villains # Ursula # Jafar # Maleficient # Bat Forest (retired in 2005) Act 3 - The Happy Ending # Snow White & Prince # Ariel & Prince Eric # Belle & the Beast # Jasmine & Aladdin # Princess Minnie's Castle Show Facts *Disney's Fantillusion has 12 floats, 400 000 light bulbs and 60 km of cabling. *Everynight, up to 50 performers take part for the parade.

The EP was originally released on 7-inch vinyl with a limited pressing of 500 copies on July 7, 1989 through Limited Potential Records. It was the band's only non-compilation release to feature drummer Brian Vermin and the first to feature Dan Vapid (then known as Sewercap), who would be featured on many later Screeching Weasel albums. Musically, the songs on Punkhouse are in a similar vein to the band's previous album Boogadaboogadaboogada!, albeit with a rougher sound. The EP went out of print quickly, and vocalist Ben Weasel repressed it himself on his own label No Budget Records in 1991 without a jacket. The last repress was by Selfless Records in 1993, who released it with a slightly different cover from the original. The song \\"Fathead\\" was later re-recorded for the group's third album My Brain Hurts in 1991 and all the original tracks from the EP were included on the compilation Kill the Musicians in 1995. Background and recording After releasing their second album Boogadaboogadaboogada! in late 1988, drummer Steve Cheese left the band because he was unwilling to tour and was replaced with Brian McQuade (renamed \\"Brian Vermin\\"). The band then went on the \\"No Showers 'til Gainesville\\" tour with local band Spongetunnel, which vocalist Ben Weasel called a \\"minor disaster\\" as the two bands argued constantly.Screeching Weasel - Kill the Musicians liner notes. Retrieved 2016-02-06 Tensions grew within Screeching Weasel at the last show of the tour and, two weeks later, bassist Warren Fish left the band. Fish was replaced by Dan Schafer (renamed \\"Sewercap\\" and later known as \\"Dan Vapid\\"), a fan of Screeching Weasel's who had been the singer for various local hardcore bands. Before starting their next tour, the band decided to record an EP and went to Studio One in Chicago in April 1989. Mike Potential, founder of the fanzine Limited Potential, served as producer/engineer and opted to release the EP on his new label Limited Potential Records. The entire EP was recorded without John Jughead's guitar, due to him being stranded in downstate Illinois. When Jughead finally made it to the sessions, the other members made him hurry recording his parts and did not notice that his guitar was out of tune with the other guitars on the recordings. Weasel later called Potential a \\"terrible engineer\\" and cited the recording quality of the EP, and him writing the lyrics to the songs while drunk, as why Punkhouse is his least favorite Screeching Weasel release.

Constructed in 1919, it has been a focal point for community attention ever since. The building served as Arlington County Fire Station #3 until a new station opened nearby in July 2011. Early history The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire Department was organized in 1898 by a group of twelve men. It is the oldest volunteer fire department in Arlington County. Since its beginnings, the Cherrydale Volunteer Fire Department has remained active in the community, serving in many ways - from fighting fires and saving lives to sponsoring Christmas and Halloween parties, dances, parades, youth sports activities, and Bingo games. During the first few years after the CVFD was organized, the equipment (consisting of leather buckets, bells, and ladders) stayed out in the open. By 1906, a small shed (later referred to as \\"House #2\\") on what is now Taylor Street was erected to house the County's first mechanized equipment - a hand-drawn water and hose cart. \\"Engine House #1,\\" another small shed with a hose tower atop, was completed on the grounds of the old Cherrydale School in December 1912. It housed the first real fire engine in Arlington, a 60-gallon pumper engine which was purchased by the Cherrydale Volunteers in 1913. In 1914, \\"Engine House #3\\" was erected in the Maywood area. \\"Engine House #4\\" was completed a few months afterwards. These buildings housed additional firefighting apparatus owned by the Volunteers, including a ladder truck and chemical engine. In 1915, after years of site searches, the Volunteers purchased a lot for $362 on Lee Highway for a new \\"Central Station House,\\" the name given to the same station that serves Cherrydale today. The Volunteers used various methods to raise money to purchase the land and begin construction of the new station. One unique method was selling bricks. Prominent citizens were asked to contribute and a brick would be placed in their name. President and Mrs. Woodrow Wilson were among those who purchased bricks for the Cherrydale Station. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Volunteers sold the four original engine houses to help pay for the \\"Central Station House.\\" and Accompanying photo On November 10, 1919, the cornerstone was placed with elaborate ceremony. The two most important speakers that day were the Honorable Ralph Walton Moore, State Senator, and Crandall Mackey, who is often called the \\"Father of the County Fire Department.\\" The new station house was officially dedicated with an elaborate banquet in 1920. In 1923, the stone nameplate was added to the front of the building. In a brief reminiscence, one Cherrydale resident remembers the station this way: \\"The Firehouse, as we called it, was just finished when I came to Cherrydale in 1919. A dignified red brick building -- thereafter, it was the center of a part of our lives. We loved listening to the stories told by the firemen -- listening for the telephone as he sat in his chair tilted against the wall near the open door in good weather. The activities there, the good times we had can never be surpassed.\\" The National Park Service listed the fire house on the National Register of Historic Places on July 28, 1995. The Arlington County Board designated the building to be a local historic district on July 28, 1995. Firehouse today Repairs and modifications to the structure have been numerous over the years. The store, to the right of the apparatus bay, has been changed many times since it was rented to a grocer in the late 1920s. A major remodeling took place in 1928 when plumbing fixtures were added followed by the addition of dormers in the 1950s. In 1987, the entire first floor of the station was remodeled for more modern equipment and living arrangements. The upstairs community hall was restored to its original appearance in 1998. The Cherrydale fire station was staffed solely by volunteers until 1940. As the area grew and call volumes increased, the County augmented the volunteer staffing by hiring a paid firefighter to help staff the station. Until 2011, the Cherrydale fire station was staffed by four Arlington County career firefighters as well as the volunteers. While the career firefighters moved to new Fire Station 3 on Old Dominion Drive, the volunteer company remains at the historic firehouse. The volunteers are trained to respond not only to fires, but also to emergency medical calls, hazardous materials incidents, and other rescue incidents. The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire Department owns Light and Air 103, which provides lighting, breathing air replenishment services, salvage, and other services to the Arlington County Fire Department, as well as a pick-up truck operating as Utility 103. They also recently purchased a rescue truck, now operating as Support 103. Support 103 serves to replace Light and Air 103, as well as add more functionality to the department. Most of the volunteers are cross-trained as firefighters and emergency medical technicians. All have participated in hundreds of hours of training to meet state and national training standards.

Known as one of the most successful Middle Eastern punk bands worldwide. History Useless ID was founded in 1994 as a four-piece: Guy Carmel - vocal and guitar, Ralf Hober - drums, Adi Elkabets - lead guitar, Nadav Elkabets - Bass. At its first years, the band was mainly active in the Israeli punk scene, and released two studio albums independently, on its own label \\"Falafel Records\\", named after band member's favorite food, the falafel. The band's singer at the time was rhythm guitarist Guy Carmel. Two years after the band's formation, the four members decided to play shows in the United States and toured around the country for six months. This successful tour was followed by five more tours around North America, two around Europe and one in Japan. In 1996, upon returning to Israel from the tours, the band's bassist Adi Elkabets was replaced by Yotam Ben-Horin. The band's international breakthrough happened in 1999, after The Ataris frontman, Kris Roe, heard the band and invited it to record a split album for Kung Fu Records. The album, titled Let It Burn, featured nine songs by the Ataris and seven by Useless ID. The song \\"Too Bad You Don't Get It\\" was also featured on Fat Wreck Chords' compilation, Short Music for Short People that same year. After the release of Let It Burn, the band signed to Kung Fu Records, and in 2001 the band's third studio album, Bad Story, Happy Ending, was released. The album was produced by Kris Roe. This was the first album by the band to feature bassist Yotam Ben-Horin on lead vocals. Ben-Horin eventually became the band's frontman and main composer and lyricist. In 2003 the band released another album via Kung Fu, titled No Vacation from the World, with Angus Cooke co-producing the album with the band, and additional production by Tony Sly of No Use for a Name. A year later, the band was featured in the Fat Wreck Chords' Rock Against Bush, Vol. 2 compilation, with the song \\"State of Fear\\". After returning to Israel, the band released its fifth album, Redemption, in December 2004 in Israel and Japan, and July 2005 in the rest of the world. This album was produced by Bill Stevenson of Descendents fame, and recorded at The Blasting Room in Colorado between March and April 2004. Drummer Ido Blaustein left the band prior to the recording of the album. Moshe Liberman played drums on the album, but Yonatan Harpak of Israeli punk band Punkache joined as the official drummer prior to the release of the album. Still in 2004, the band took part in the movie \\"Jericho's Echo\\", directed by Liz Nord, which dealt with the Israeli punk and hardcore scene. On September 2006, the band released a DVD, titled Ratfaces Home Videos Presents Useless ID, containing live and studio video clips of the band. In 2008 the band returned to the Blasting Room, to record its sixth studio album, again with Stevenson as producer. On July 24, 2008, it was announced that the album, entitled The Lost Broken Bones, would be released via Suburban Home Records in October of that year. After the recording of the album, the band left for a brief tour around the United Kingdom, and in June 2008, the band played live in Trafalgar Square, London, as part of the \\"Salute to Israel\\" event. After another tour in Japan and China in September, the band returned to Israel for a special release show of The Lost Broken Bones on October 18, 2008, at the Barby club in Tel Aviv, joined by famous musicians from the Israeli mainstream music scene, including Danny Sanderson, Muki and more. The band finished off 2008 with an Israeli tour supporting The Lost Broken Bones, playing in Haifa, with Betzefer and Friday Night Sissy Fight, in Tel Aviv with Got No Shame and Kill The Drive, and in Jerusalem with Man Alive, Mondo Gecko and Evenyaru. In Purim 2009, the band joined Betzefer and Almana Shchora for a special show in Tel Aviv. After opening for No Use for a Name for two shows in Tel Aviv, Israel, Useless ID joined them as support on the remainder of their summer European dates during June and July. In the summer of 2009, the band recorded an album in Hebrew, with Israeli hip hop/reggae artist Muki, in which the band wrote and played all the music, and Muki was responsible for all the lyrics. Useless ID singer Yotam Ben-Horin co- sings on some songs. The band celebrated the launch of the project with a tour across Israel, starting with the first show on August 15, 2009, at the Barzilay Club in Tel Aviv. The collaboration's launch show was on September 30, 2009, at the Reading 3 club at the Tel Aviv port. In September 2009, Yotam Ben-Horin has finished recording his solo acoustic album, and started writing material for the next Useless ID album. The Muki and Useless ID collaboration album was released on January 7, 2010, followed by an official release show on January 28, 2010, at the Barby club in Tel Aviv. In May 2010, frontman Yotam Ben-Horin confirmed that he had written most of the material for the band's next album, with only some writing left and plans to record the album in the end of 2010. In July 2010, the band went on a European tour with Gideon Berger of Kill the Drive filling in on drums, as the band's drummer Yonatan Harpak could not leave the country. In February 2011, the band recorded and mixed their next album at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado with producer Bill Stevenson, with whom they had worked on their previous two albums. On January 30, 2011, Yotam Ben-Horin announced on his Facebook page that songwriting for the new Useless ID album was complete. On February 16, 2011, the band released a compilation album, entitled The Lost Broken Tunes: Vol. 1. The compilation was released exclusively in Japan, and featured demos, outtakes, acoustic tracks and other rare tracks that didn't make the band's last album The Lost Broken Bones. A second volume, entitled The Lost Broken Tunes: Vol. 2 followed a month later, on March 16, 2011, and included older demos and unreleased material that dated back to 1999. Useless ID planned to perform as a supporting act to Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine on July 2, 2011, at the Barby club in Tel Aviv, Israel, but three days before the show, Biafra announced that he would be cancelling his appearance for political reasons. In response, the band turned the concert into a free show, with supporting acts Bo La'Bar and Mondo Gecko, for all the disappointed fans. On November 28, 2011, it was announced that Fat Wreck Chords had signed Useless ID and would release their next album. The resulting album, their seventh, was entitled Symptoms and was released on February 14, 2012. On January 10, 2012, the song \\"Before It Kills\\" was released as the first single off the new album, on the Fat Wreck Chords website, while the band debuted another new song, \\"New Misery\\", while playing a Vans sponsored show with Betzefer, on January 5, 2012. On February 21, 2012, Alternative Press premiered the music video for \\"Before It Kills\\", the first single off Symptoms. The same day, the band also released the power ballad \\"Somewhere\\" as a radio single, being the second single off Symptoms. On March 7, 2012, it was announced that drummer Jonathan Harpak would be leaving the band after eight years, to pursue other musical projects. His replacement was announced to be guitarist Ishay Berger's younger brother Gilad Gilad - Gideon Berger, who is also the drummer for Haifa based skate punk band Kill the Drive, and had played with Useless ID before, in 2010, as a touring member. In June-July 2012, the band embarked on a European tour supporting Lagwagon, with a few headlining dates in between, supported by Gallows and Adept. In October 2012, the band embarked on another tour supporting Lagwagon, along with The Flatliners and Dead to Me, this time touring the US and Canada. In November, they supported the German punk band Die Toten Hosen on their Ballast der Republik Tour in Germany, playing major arenas, in front of big crowds. On June 17, 2013, the band released \\"Symptoms\\" as their third single of their album of the same name. An animated music video by young Israeli animation artist Yotam Goren was released for the single. On October 4, 2015, the band played a special show at the Barby club in Tel Aviv, celebrating the 10 year anniversary of their 2005 album Redemption. During the show, the band announced they would be flying to the United States to record a new album in December. On December 3, 2015, the band announced via their official Facebook page that it had begun recording a new studio album at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, with producers Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore, who produced the band's previous three albums. Recording and mixing for the album was complete by December 19, 2015. On April 15, 2016, the band announced that their eighth studio album - State Is Burning would be released on July 1, 2016, and released the first single off the album, \\"We Don't Want the Airwaves\\". It was announced that the single would be released on a 7\\" EP on May 6, 2016, that would feature the single, as well as three exclusive tracks: an album B-side that didn't make the cut for the album, as well as two acoustic outtakes, one of which is for the title track of the album.

It is part of the Anne Arundel County Public Schools system and is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. In 2013, Newsweek ranked Annapolis as one of the top 2,000 high schools in the country. History Founded in 1896, Annapolis High was the first public high school to open in Anne Arundel County and among the first in the state of Maryland. Though nearby Arundel High School was founded earlier in 1854, it was run as a private school until 1926. The school originally occupied a brick building in historic, downtown Annapolis, but the post-World War I population surge led to the construction of a new school that stood on the outskirts of downtown Annapolis within a short distance from Wiley H. Bates \\"Colored\\" High School. In the mid-1960s ‚Äî more than a decade after the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education ‚Äî Annapolis High and Bates High were desegregated. Soon thereafter, the Wiley H. Bates High School became Annapolis Middle School for grades 9 and 10 in 1966-67 and Bates Junior High School for grades 7 to 9 in 1968. In 1979, Annapolis High moved to its present location on Riva Road outside the city limits. Its former buildings now house Bates (which has been a grades 6 to 8 middle school since 1989) and the Maryland Hall for the Creative Arts. Academics In 2010, Annapolis High was ranked as the 16th best high school in the state of Maryland (3rd in Anne Arundel County; 297th overall) in Newsweek's America's Best High Schools list. Annapolis is noted for its International Baccalaureate (I.B.) program ‚Äî one of three county schools with the program (the other two being Meade and Old Mill). The I.B. program is a rigorous college-preparatory curriculum for grades 11 and 12 that emphasizes critical thinking and features a strong international focus. The school also offers nearly every Advanced Placement (A.P.) class approved by the College Board as well as an English for Speakers of Other Languages program. Recently, the Annapolis High math team has won the Anne Arundel County High School Mathematics Competition four years straight (2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010). Annapolis High publishes a school newspaper (The Anchor), a yearbook (The Wake), a literary & arts magazine (Perception), and produces a newscast (Pantherama/P:tv). Performing and Visual Arts (PVA) School Beginning the 2012-2013 school year, Annapolis High School, along with Broadneck High School became the Performing and Visual Arts (PVA) high schools of Anne Arundel County. PVA is the now newest option of Magnet programs Anne Arundel County has to offer. Magnet Programs of Choice are optional advanced programs of studies, each specializing and emphasizing instruction in their own areas of interest. PVA's focuses delve into honing and strengthening artistic craft and talent. Students residing in Anne Arundel County have the opportunity to try out for the PVA, and if they pass their audition, they attend either Annapolis or Broadneck High School, depending on which branch of the PVA they audition for. The branches of the PVA that Annapolis houses are Creative Writing, Fine/Digital Visual Art, Dance, Film, Technical Production/Arts Management and Theatre. All branches of Broadkneck PVA are affiliated with a field of Music. County PVA program high school students from both Annapolis and Broakneck collaborate and continue their art studies at a separate building, Studio 39 in down-town Historic Annapolis. Here students are given instruction by professionals in the art world, in additional after school classes. Students also perform shows, create art installations, and put up art galleries that are viewable to the public. Athletics Annapolis High has a football program dating back to 1896 that has won state titles; a boys' basketball program ‚Äî that has won several state titles; and boys' and girls' lacrosse programs dating back to 1929 that have won numerous state championships. Annapolis has also won state championships in girls' gymnastics (1989). Zero-basing controversy & academic turnaround After the school's standardized test scores failed to meet federal Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) standards, Anne Arundel County Schools Superintendent Kevin M. Maxwell required the school's entire staff ‚Äî including the principal, administrators, teachers, secretaries, and custodians ‚Äî to reapply for their positions in the fall of 2007, a controversial move termed \\"zero-basing\\" that is one of several reform options authorized by the Maryland Department of Education and the federal No Child Left Behind law. As a result, around half of the teachers and staff did not return in 2008. The school also hired a group of \\"AYP Specialists\\" and other support staff to focus primarily on ensuring that the school's standardized test scores reached state and federal standards. Within 30 months of zero-basing, the school successfully made an academic turnaround and met AYP standards in two consecutive years and increased the number of students who passed the Maryland School Assessment 34 percentage points in English and 19 points in math. As a result of this turnaround, principal Don Lilley was named the state's best principal by the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals in 2010. As of the 2011-12 school year, Annapolis High did not make AYP despite extensive efforts by teachers to do so.

In the screenplay, the Black Pearl is easily recognized by her distinctive black hull and sails. Captained by Captain Jack Sparrow, she is said to be \\"nigh uncatchable\\". Indeed, in the first three films she either overtakes or flees all other ships, including the Interceptor (regarded as the fastest ship in the Caribbean) and the Flying Dutchman (which is actually faster against the wind). Her speed is partly derived from the large amount of sails she carries, and partly supernatural. She is noted in At World's End as being \\"the only ship that can outrun the Dutchman.\\" Background The Black Pearl was originally a merchant ship called Wicked Wench (the name of the ship from the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Disneyland Park, which is shown shelling a fort), but its crew later turned to piracy under the command of a pirate captain named Morgan, who was killed during a battle with Spanish Royal Navy Captain Armando Salazar. The helmsman, Jack Sparrow, was granted captaincy of the Wicked Wench after out-maneuvering Salazar and saving the crew during battle. Years later, the Wicked Wench became registered to the East India Trading Co. and owned by Cutler Beckett, the EITC Director for West Africa. At the time, Jack Sparrow was in the employ of the East India Trading Co. and regained captaincy of the Wicked Wench (this fits in with reality as history notes that pirates did not build ships specifically to commit piracy. Instead, they either bought or stole small, fast vessels, then retrofitted them with heavy armaments). (As detailed in the 2011 Disney Publishing novel, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Price of Freedom, written by A.C. Crispin) Jack Sparrow captained the Wicked Wench for Cutler Beckett for about a year, hauling various cargoes, but he refused to haul slaves. Hoping to recruit Sparrow as one of his many \\"operatives\\", Beckett indulged what he regarded as an odd peccadillo of Sparrow's until he and the captain came to part ways. Beckett had dispatched Sparrow on a mission to find the lost island of Kerma, and the treasure at the heart of its underground labyrinth, but Sparrow double-crossed the EITC official and claimed he couldn't locate the island. Suspicious that Sparrow had indeed found the island and the treasure, but had not given him its accurate location, Beckett, determined to browbeat the captain into obedience, demanded that the young captain transport a cargo of slaves to the New World. Initially Sparrow agreed, but when he realized that he was betraying the Wicked Wench, as well as himself, he rebelled and freed the slaves by taking them to Kerma for safe asylum. Furious that Sparrow had flouted his orders and stolen the \\"cargo\\" of \\"black gold\\", Beckett had Sparrow thrown into jail. After allowing him to languish for a couple of months, Beckett had Sparrow transported to the Wicked Wench's anchorage, about a mile from the coast of West Africa, near Calabar on the Bight of Benin. After personally branding Sparrow with the \\"P\\" brand (so he'd be forever identifiable as a pirate), Cutler Beckett gave the order to fire incendiary carcass charges at the Wicked Wench, in order to totally demoralize her captain. Sparrow fought his way free from his guards, dove overboard and attempted to rescue his burning, foundering ship, but he was too late. The Wicked Wench turned into an inferno, then sank, taking Jack with her. But, while dying, Sparrow called upon Davy Jones, and struck a bargain with him: his soul and one hundred years service aboard the Flying Dutchman, in return for a continued human existence of thirteen years as captain, plus saving the Wicked Wench and transforming her into the fastest, most dangerous pirate ship on the seven seas. Jones agreed, and raised the ship from the sea floor, now a charred vessel with an angel figurehead. In keeping with her scorched appearance, Jack painted his ship black and added black sails, rechristening her \\"the Black Pearl\\". Two years later, the Black Pearl was in search of the mysterious Isla de Muerta with a new crew, where the legendary Chest of Cort√©s was hidden. Captain and crew agreed to equal shares of the treasure, but devious first mate Hector Barbossa persuaded Jack that equal shares included knowing the treasure's location. Jack complied, and soon after Barbossa led a mutiny and marooned Jack on an island. The crew found the Aztec gold, which was spent very quickly, not believing in the curse placed on it: that anyone who stole the coins would become an undead being, unable to feel anything but unsoothable hunger, and that only moonlight would reveal their true form. This curse being real, the pirates were soon hideous living skeletons with tattered flesh and clothing clinging to their bones. Even the Black Pearl was affected by the curse upon its crew, becoming constantly shrouded in an eerie mist and operating with tattered sails ripped in many places. Appearances=The Curse of the Black Pearl The Jolly Roger of Barbossa's Crew, which was originally the flag of pirate Calico Jack The curse could only be lifted when all eight hundred and eighty two coins were returned to the chest along with a trace of blood from each pirate who stole one. William \\"Bootstrap Bill\\" Turner Sr., the only crew member who defended Jack Sparrow during the mutiny, sent a coin to his young son Will Turner in England, believing the crew \\"deserved to be cursed, and remain cursed\\". In retaliation, Barbossa (as Pintel put it), \\"strapped a cannon to old Bootstrap's bootstraps. The last we saw of old Bill Turner... he was sinking to the crushing black oblivion of Davy Jones' locker\\". Only then did Barbossa's crew learn that they also needed Bootstrap's blood to break the curse, and by throwing him overboard they had, in fact, doomed themselves to continued damnation. Over the next decade, the Black Pearl menaced the Caribbean as the pirates searched tirelessly for the Aztec gold, until all but one piece was found. As a boy, Will Turner Jr. brought the gold medallion with him on his journey to the Caribbean, although Elizabeth Swann, the governor's daughter, came into possession of it and kept it hidden for eight years. The Pearl later attacked Port Royal and abducted Elizabeth, believing she was Bootstrap's child‚Äîtheir only remaining source of Turner blood when it was really Will. The Pearl is eventually commandeered by Sparrow with a new crew. While most of Barbossa's crew are battling the Royal Navy aboard HMS Dauntless, Barbossa, Monk, Jacoby and Weatherby fight Elizabeth, Will and a now-cursed Jack Sparrow at Isla de Muerta. After Will and Jack put their blood on their respective pieces and return them to the chest of Cort√©s, the Aztec curse is lifted. With the crew no longer immortal, Jack uses his single shot - which he carried for ten years - to kill Barbossa. During the battle, Jack's crew are able to commandeer the Pearl, leaving Jack behind at Isla de Muerta. However, they later rescue him after he escapes execution in Port Royal, and he again takes command of the ship. Between the first and second installments The Black Pearl was pursued by Commodore James Norrington and the Royal Navy. Off of Tripoli, a large hurricane battered the Pearl (though it survived) and HMS Dauntless, which sank, along with most of its crew. Norrington survived, and later resigned from the Navy. Dead Man's Chest One year later, the Black Pearl is still being captained by Jack Sparrow, although his crew is not content with him; they want \\"a speck of honest pirating\\", and are upset about the Royal Navy's pursuit and the hurricane. Davy Jones sends Bootstrap Bill Turner to remind Jack that he owes his soul and one hundred years of service aboard the Flying Dutchman to Jones; Jack's thirteen years of captaincy have now passed. Jack is marked with the black spot, which means that the Kraken is now hunting to drag both Sparrow and his ship down to the Locker. Jack has the ship sailed to the nearest land - Pelegosto, an island inhabited by a cannibal tribe. Jack and the surviving crew escape the cannibals with Will Turner, Pintel and Ragetti, and visit the voodoo priestess Tia Dalma for advice. Dalma details how Davy Jones cut out his own heart and locked it in the hidden \\"Dead Man's Chest\\". The crew learns that if Jones' heart is stabbed, he will die, so whomever controls Jones' heart can command Jones himself. Dalma then helps the crew of the Pearl track down the Flying Dutchman. When Jack sends Will over to the Dutchman, the Pearl is boarded by Jones' cursed crew. Jack makes a deal with Davy Jones; he will deliver Jones 100 souls in three days in exchange for his own. Jones agrees, temporarily removing the Black Spot from Jack's palm. Jones and his crew then depart aboard the Dutchman with Will (who is \\"a good-faith payment\\"), while the Pearl travels to Tortuga to \\"recruit\\" the remaining 99 souls. In Tortuga, Jack runs into Elizabeth and a drunk, washed-up James Norrington. Owing to her desire to find Will, Elizabeth is able to provide Jack with a heading to the dead man's chest, which is buried on Isla Cruces. With each desiring control of Jones for his own ends, a three-way sword fight ensues between Jack, Norrington and Will (who has escaped from the Dutchman with the help of his father). After Jack manages to obtain the heart of Davy Jones from the chest (which is secretly stolen from him by Norrington), the Black Pearl is attacked by the Flying Dutchman. However, the Pearl is able to outrun the Dutchman owing to a favourable wind (the Pearl being faster with the wind). Davy Jones then unleashes the Kraken on the Pearl. Despite successfully fighting the Kraken off twice, the ship still sustains heavy damage and most of her crew are killed. Jack orders the surviving crew to abandon ship. After figuring out that the Kraken is only after Jack and not the Pearl, Elizabeth distracts Jack by kissing him, then chains him to the ship's mast and leaves him behind. Resigned to his fate, Jack bravely charges the maw of the Kraken, and the Pearl is dragged down to Davy Jones' Locker as the surviving crew watches. Mourning the loss of Sparrow, the crew return to Tia Dalma's shack. There, Dalma asks them if they would \\"sail to the ends of the Earth and beyond, to fetch back 'witty Jack' and him precious Pearl\\". Gibbs, Pintel, Ragetti, Cotton's parrot (who speaks for both itself and its master), Elizabeth and Will all agree. Tia Dalma then announces their new captain, Hector Barbossa, who asks what has become of \\"his\\" ship. At World's End Led by the newly resurrected Captain Barbossa, Tia Dalma and the crew of the Black Pearl vow to rescue Jack Sparrow and his ship from Davy Jones' Locker. By means of Chinese navigational charts from the Pirate Lord of Singapore, Sao Feng, they find themselves in the Locker. Jack and the Pearl are stranded in a seemingly- endless desert, but Tia Dalma is able to use the Locker's mysterious crustaceans (crabs that appear to be rocks) to transport Jack and the Pearl to the nearby shore. Jack deciphers a clue from the navigational charts, and the crew capsize the ship at sunset. The Black Pearl then returns to the living world at sunrise. Back in the realm of the living, the Black Pearl resupplies at an island, but is ambushed by Sao Feng (aboard his vessel Empress) and Jack's old enemy Cutler Beckett (aboard his flagship HMS Endeavour). Disputes mean that the Pearl is now desired by multiple characters. Captain Sparrow's claim is that it is his ship; Captain Barbossa's is that it was his ship; Will needs the Pearl to free his father from Davy Jones; Sao Feng covets the fastest ship in the Caribbean, and Cutler Beckett won't \\"give up the only ship that can outrun the Dutchman\\". After Elizabeth joins Sao Feng on the Empress, the Pearl and the Empress launch a surprise attack on the Endeavour and flee. In response, Beckett sends the Flying Dutchman to track down the Empress. Sao Feng is mortally wounded in the ensuing attack, and dies after naming Elizabeth his successor as captain. Meanwhile, the Black Pearl escapes to \\"Shipwreck Cove\\", a secret pirate rendezvous, where the fourth meeting of the Brethren Court is then convened. After Captain Elizabeth Swann arrives, the Pearl becomes the flagship of the Pirate Armada, led by the elected Pirate King, Elizabeth Swann. Captain Sparrow, Captain Barbossa and Captain Swann take a parley with Lord Beckett, Davy Jones and Will Turner (who was pushed overboard by Sparrow for his attempted mutiny on the crew of the Pearl). After Beckett reveals that Jack purposefully used Will's betrayal to try to save himself from Jones' wrath, Captains Swann and Barbossa trade Jack for Will; Jack is then imprisoned in the brig of the Dutchman. Helmed by Captain Barbossa, the Black Pearl then engages in a sea battle around a maelstrom against the Flying Dutchman. The two ships are evenly matched, and both are damaged by the other's cannons and later boarded. On the Dutchman, Jack escapes the brig and engages Davy Jones in a sword fight. Stealing the key to the dead man's chest from Jones, Jack threatens his foe with stabbing Jones' heart. However, Jones fatally stabs a downed Will Turner, and Jack instead helps Will to stab Jones' heart, killing Jones. As both ships near the bottom of the maelstrom, the topmasts become entangled. The Dutchman begins to pull down both ships, so Pintel and Ragetti fire a chain-shot at the entangled masts. Jack and Elizabeth escape the Dutchman using a makeshift parasail, and the Pearl escapes the maelstrom while the Dutchman sinks. Once the storm subsides, the Pearl is still afloat but substantially damaged, and no match for the Endeavour which is advancing on it. However, the Dutchman resurfaces with Captain Will Turner in command. The Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman sail alongside each other and destroy the Endeavor, killing Lord Cutler Beckett and forcing the now-leaderless EITC Armada to flee. In Tortuga, Jack again loses the Black Pearl to Barbossa, though the crew of the Pearl (including Pintel, Ragetti, Marty, Murtogg and Mullroy), \\"are unsettled about leaving Captain Jack behind - again\\", indeed they all leave the Black Pearl and Barbossa recruits a new crew. However, Sparrow has secretly stolen the critical portion of Barbossa's navigational charts, and go back to searching for the Pearl and for the immortality. Between the third and fourth installments Some time after leaving Tortuga, the Black Pearl was attacked by the pirate ship Queen Anne's Revenge, captained by the infamous Blackbeard. Using the supernatural powers of the Sword of Triton, Blackbeard brought the rigging of the Pearl to life, which wrapped around Barbossa's crew \\"like snakes\\". Barbossa's men were swiftly defeated and the Black Pearl captured, magically shrunk and placed in a bottle by Blackbeard. Barbossa thought himself the only survivor of the attack, being forced to cut off his own leg to escape the doomed Pearl. On Stranger Tides After Blackbeard's death, Jack regains the Pearl in a bottle, and Gibbs fills a large sack with the bottles of other fallen ships from Queen Anne's Revenge; as the film concludes, Jack states that he is aware of a way of getting the Pearl back to full size, but it will require \\"a crossbow, an hourglass, three goats, one of [them] must learn to play the trumpet, whilst the other one goes like this\\" (\\"this\\" being a wiggling of the fingers). Barbossa also claims Blackbeard's ship, sword and surviving crew after Blackbeard's demise. Dead Men Tell No Tales The Black Pearl appears in the fifth installment of the movie franchise in its original form (as the Wicked Wench). The Wicked Wench makes its appearance during a sequence where Captain Armando Salazar is reminiscing about how and when he first met Jack Sparrow. In the flashback, the Wicked Wenchs helmsman is a young Jack Sparrow. While being chased by Salazar's ship the Silent Mary into unknown water, the crew of the Wicked Wench throw ropes around nearby reefs off the port side and use the rigging to slingshot the ship into the opposite direction. Jack steers the ship through the reef, saving the crew and the ship by changing the ship's course at the last second. Afterward, on the deck of the Wicked Wench, the crew rewards Sparrow with \\"tribute\\" and bestow Jack with his famous hat and other personal effects. They make Jack a captain on the deck of the ship. We also learn Jack also got the name \\"Sparrow\\" by taunting Salazar, \\"chirping like a sparrow\\" from the crow's nest of the Wench. In the present day, the Pearl has remained trapped in its bottle for 'five winters', Jack keeping it in his pocket even as he is forced to use a smaller ship known as the Dying Gull to go to sea. Later in the film, Barbossa uses Blackbeard's sword to restore the Pearl to its regular size; stabbing the bottle with Blackbeard's sword cracks it, the bottle subsequently breaking as the Pearl grows to the size of a larger model, only regaining its full size when it returns to the sea. Barbossa then claims the ship for himself to battle the undead Captain Salazar, tying Jack to the rear of the ship, however later Jack managed to escape thanks to the help of Henry Turner, son of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann who has formed an alliance with him to find the Trident. After tracking down the island where the Trident of Poseidon is located, triggering a mystical convergence that opens a trench in the ocean, Salazar claims the Trident for himself, but Henry and Carina Smyth destroy the trident when Salazar attempts to use it to kill Jack. The destruction of the trident restores Salazar and his men to full life, but also causes the sea trench to collapse, with the Pearls crew lowering its anchor to pull Jack, Henry and Carina to safety. Salazar attempts to climb up the anchor to attack Jack, but Barbossa sacrifices himself to stab Salazar and save the others (Carina having been identified as his daughter). At the film's conclusion, after witnessing Carina and Henry as they watch Will Turner's reunion with Elizabeth Swan- the destruction of the Trident also freeing Will from his role as captain of the Flying Dutchman, Jack departs as he is restored to his traditional role as the captain of the Black Pearl with both his crew from the Dying Gull and Barbossa's crew from the Queen Anne's Revenge joining him. Armament The Black Pearl is moderately armed and carries 32 twelve-pound cannons: 18 on the gun deck and 14 on the upper deck. Its full broadside contains 16 cannonballs that weigh 192 lb (). Extremely unusual for a pirate ship, the Pearl has no chase guns (cannons used while being chased or chasing, as a regular broadside volley cannot be used in this situation) in her bow or stern, giving her a grave tactical disadvantage during a chase as the Pearl cannot shoot a ship it is chasing or return fire at a pursuer; her high speed only partially negates this handicap. In Dead Man's Chest another advantage the Black Pearl has over her enemies is her ability to hide in the sea at night, since if all the ship's lamps are blown out the ship is no longer visible thanks to her black hull and sails. This is also seen in Curse of the Black Pearl where she is able to sneak unhindered into Port Royal under the cover of darkness. Filming In the first movie, the Black Pearl was a steel barge with wooden structures built on top to resemble a real ship. In addition, a soundstage set was used to achieve better control over fog machines. For the second and third movies, a floating sailing ship was actually built in the shipyards at Bayou La Batre in Alabama on the hull of the cargo ship Sunset to serve as the set, though it is not an authentic tall ship.Pirates of the Caribbean presskit, accessed Dec 9, 2006Pirates of the Caribbean page at the-bahama-islands.com , accessed Dec 9, 2006 Another version, mounted on a gimbal, was built for filming the Maelstrom battle. In 2010, the Sunset, which played the Black Pearl in most of the films, was reconstructed to portray the Queen Anne's Revenge in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.

He was the founder of Crossroads Christian Communications and host of the long-running Christian talk show 100 Huntley Street. Early life Mainse was born on August 13, 1936 in Campbell's Bay, Quebec. He was raised in a rural area near Ottawa, Ontario, then continued his education at Sudbury Secondary in Sudbury. Mainse was highly influenced by his father, Roy Lake Mainse (1896‚Äì1972), who worked as a missionary in Egypt, and then as a Holiness Movement Church pastor in Ontario and Quebec. Mainse determined to go into ministry while still a teenager. He studied theology at Eastern Pentecostal Bible College (now Master's College and Seminary) in Peterborough, Ontario and was ordained. He pastored Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada churches in Brighton, Deep River and Hamilton. He met and married Norma-Jean Rutledge in 1958. Television career He began his communications ministry in 1962 with a 15-minute program following the late night news on affiliate CHOV in Pembroke, Ontario, while he pastored in Deep River. He later began a television program called Crossroads. The program gradually expanded to stations across Canada, but with minimal penetration into the American heartland. In 1975 Mainse left the pastorate to focus full-time on television and evangelism projects. He began the ministry known as Crossroads Christian Communications in the early seventies with Circle Square, a children's telecast that has been carried in over 50 countries and continues to be shown in some. Mainse later made the fictional ranch a reality as the summer camp, Circle Square Ranch. At its peak there were 11 Circle Square Ranches across Canada. In 1976, Mainse began a project to telecast daily. He took the initiative and obtained a $100,000 a year, 20-year lease on a building at 100 Huntley Street in downtown Toronto that was suitable for conversion into a television studio. The lead program of this new production company took the studio's address as its name. On June 15, 1977, the interview/talk show 100 Huntley Street (based on The 700 Club in the United States) was launched. This TV program featured more than 14,000 guests such as Billy Graham and Charlton Heston, and in 2015 was reported as one of three Canadian TV programs attracting over one million viewers each week. Crossroads produced a short- lived program for teenagers, Inside Track, in 1978. In 1979, outside the Toronto mayor's office, Mainse protested the gay publication The Body Politic, saying that \\"parents and all decent people are particularly disgusted by the perversity, which publishes and disseminates anti-child, anti-parent dehumanizing materials.\\" During the rally, Mainse was filmed protesting alongside Ken Campbell. Originally aired January 7, 1979. Mainse appears at 1:15. In 1998, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission granted Crossroads a licence to operate a 24-hour commercial TV station on cable, based in Burlington, Ontario and covering North America on satellite. CITS-TV has been broadcasting since September 1998. The station has been branded as YesTV since 2014. Mainse served for several years at the request of mutual funds billionaire John Templeton as a judge in the awarding of the Templeton Prize. He received numerous awards for excellence in television production from the US-based National Religious Broadcasters, and several honorary doctorates, the most recent being from Tyndale University College and Seminary in Toronto in 2003. Mainse stepped down as president of Crossroads and Host of 100 Huntley Street in the summer of 2003. He passed the torch to his youngest son, Ron Mainse of Burlington, Ontario. He remained on the CTS board. Crossroads' current CEO is Lorna Dueck and 100 Huntley Street is hosted by Greg Musselman, Cheryl Weber and Maggie John. Though retired he continued to be featured on 100 Huntley Street through various segments acting as a spokesman for Crossroads on various issues of social concern. Mainse has published a book, SALT. In 2009, Mainse returned to host 100 Huntley Street while his sons Ron and Reynold stepped down from the ministry while under investigation concerning an alleged Ponzi scheme. In January 2010 he launched new television programs, Really Good Medicine and A Living Witness to Amazing Grace. That year he undertook a tour of 150 Canadian cities, \\"Thank You Canada\\", celebrating his 50th year of television ministry. In June 2012, the same month as Crossroads' 50th anniversary, Mainse was presented the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal at a gala event at Roy Thomson Hall.Governor General of Canada - Find a Recipient In May 2015 he received a Lifetime Global Impact award from Empowered21, for making \\"a significant impact on the world through the power of the Holy Spirit\\". Also in 2012 he launched the 100 Words Daily Devotional Blog that in 2016 expanded into a two- minute segment throughout the day on YesTV.

The original Sabbac debuted in Captain Marvel, Jr. #4 (February 1943), and was created by Otto Binder and Al Carreno in 1943 as an enemy of Captain Marvel, Jr., while an updated version debuted in Outsiders vol. 3 #8, and was created by Judd Winick and Tom Raney in 2004 as a nemesis for both Junior and the Outsiders superhero team. A third version was introduced in Justice League #21 in 2013 by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank as an adversary for the Shazam Family and an associate of Black Adam and the Seven Deadly Sins of Man. Fictional character biographies=Timothy Karnes The original Sabbac is depicted as a \\"dark opposite\\" to the Marvels, similar to Captain Marvel's foe Ibac, who draws his powers from four historical villains. The dark forces of Hell gave the human Timothy Karnes (alternatively spelled as Barnes) the power to become a being with powers to rival Captain Marvel. To access this power, all Karnes has to do is say the magic word 'Sabbac' , and magic black lightning strikes up from the underworld and transforms him into a muscle-bound demon with super-strength, super-speed, flight, fire breath, and the ability to emit fire blasts from the palms of his hands. His powers match those of the Marvels. Like Captain Marvel's magic word 'Shazam' , the word Sabbac is an acronym for the six beings who empower Sabbac: the demons Satan, Aym, Belial, Beelzebub, Asmodeus and Crateis. He resembles Timothy in green robes but with a more muscular build and fangs in his pronounced overbite. Sabbac was an enemy of Captain Marvel, Jr.. Sabbac appeared in two issues of the Golden Age Captain Marvel Jr. comic book (issues #4 and 6, both from 1943), and in two issues each of World's Finest Comics and Adventure Comics during the early 1980s. When he first appears he joins Nazi agents, being promised power over America if he helps them conquer it, and tries to destroy transport lines to isolate eastern and western North America. However, as he continues to battle Jr., the various demons empowering him leave him as things grow increasingly bleak for the villain, removing his powers until Satan leaves him, allowing him to be defeated. In 2004, Sabbac was introduced into DC continuity in Outsiders (vol. 3) #8 written by Judd Winick. The story established Timothy Karnes as Freddy Freeman's (Captain Marvel Jr.'s alter-ego), former foster brother. Freddy's parents, David and Rebecca Freeman, had taken Timothy in, but the boy was sent to live with another family when the couple were killed in a car accident. Timothy would find himself shuffled from one abusive foster home to another, and grew to hate and resent Freddy Freeman, who lived a successful and relatively peaceful life with his grandfather. Sabbac's origin was depicted in the 2005/2006 Superman/Shazam! First Thunder miniseries, written by Winick and drawn by Joshua Middleton. Dr. Sivana, hoping to find a way to kill Captain Marvel, has the high priest of the Temple of Bagdan kidnap Timothy, whom they learn is a descendant of the Bagdan line and the heir to the demonic powers of Sabbac. During a Satanic ritual, Timothy is transformed for the first time into the demon Sabbac and challenges Superman and Captain Marvel. Marvel defeats Sabbac after tricking him into saying his name (and thus causing him to turn back into Timothy). Ishmael Gregor In Outsiders (vol. 3) #8-10, Captain Marvel, Jr. and the Outsiders team face a new, more feral version of Sabbac. This version of Sabbac, possessing amplified demonic powers and a hairy beast- like appearance with horns instead of the more humanoid original form, is the alter ego of Ishmael Gregor, a Russian immigrant who had become a New York City mob boss. Gregor lusted after the power of Sabbac and had his men find Timothy Karnes, who had been incarcerated and had his voice box removed to prevent him from speaking. Gregor initiates a demonic ritual which he states will allow Karnes to access his power without needing to speak. The ritual involves the murder of an entire New York bus full of passengers. At the end, Gregor kills Karnes and gains the power of Sabbac for himself. The second Sabbac opens a portal in the backyard of a very specific California home. This brings a host of demons into the world. He is challenged by the Outsiders and Captain Marvel Jr. and flees when his demons are defeated. The Secret Society of Super-Villains sends Deathstroke the Terminator to Las Vegas, where Sabbac is taking over the local Mafia. Deathstroke kills Sabbac's personal entourage and convinces him that the Society has much to offer.Outsiders #29 (December 2005) Sabbac also works with the Fearsome Five to attack Alcatraz in San Francisco, now a supervillain prison. They are there for the seemingly minor purpose of freeing the FF member Mammoth. During the attack, the magical Rock of Eternity explodes over Gotham City. Sabbac's preparations allow him to absorb the sentient power of the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man. He also grows much larger. He uses 'Lust' to bring down the Five, the Alcatraz prisoners, and a majority of the guards. He uses the other sins in combat against the Outsiders. Donna Troy appears and the heroes use Katana's magic Soultaker sword to imprison the demon.Outsiders #30 (January 2006) From inside the Soultaker, Sabbac admits that the Society had enlisted him to kidnap Captain Marvel Jr. and bring him to Lex Luthor. One Year Later When the Outsiders were out of options, Katana summoned forth Ishmael from the Soultaker to destroy Dr. Sivana's base. 52 In the 52 maxiseries, Captain Marvel, on the brink of insanity due to the Sins' voices, mentioned that Sabbac had tried an assault on the Rock of Eternity.52 Week 12 (July 26, 2006) Later in the series, Sabbac attacked Boston on Halloween, with the intention of kidnapping children and sacrificing their souls to the demon-lord Neron, causing a new age of blood. Sabbac is now several stories tall, and is only stopped through the efforts of both the Marvel Family and the Black Marvel Family, who strike him with their lightning and knock him out. The Black Marvels then move him to an unknown location, and their popularity is increased.52 Week 25 (October 25, 2006) The New 52 After DC's 2011 New 52 reboot, a new version of Sabbac was introduced in Geoff Johns and Gary Frank's Shazam! reboot. This version of Sabbac was a physical manifestation of the Seven Deadly Sins of Man, who can simultaneously possess a wicked person (in this case, Mr. Bryer, a rich man who bullies Billy Batson along with his sons) and transform that person into a 50-foot demon that breathes fire.Justice League (vol. 2) #21 (August 2013) Sabbac then attacks downtown Philadelphia under the command of Black Adam, who is intent on having the demon destroy the world so Adam can remake it in his own image.Justice League (vol. 2) #14 (November 2012) The Shazam Family unites to save the city from Sabbac as Shazam himself takes on Black Adam.Justice League (vol. 2) #21 (August 2013) Bryer is then sent to the hospital after Sabbac leaves his body. Powers and abilities Sabbac has superhuman strength, agility and endurance. He is able to fly at incredible speeds and project fire from his mouth and hands. He is now several stories high. This is accomplished by saying Sabbac, which will also undo the change. In other media * Sabbac is mentioned in the Young Justice episode \\"Misplaced\\". Cat Grant is reading a news report that states he and Ibac had been defeated by Captain Marvel earlier in the day. * Ishmael Gregor appears in the fifth season of Arrow, portrayed by David Meunier. He is a character featured in flashbacks, where he serves as the Pakhan of the Solntsevskaya Bratva.

Oliver outs Gregor, causing a civil war within the Bratva ranks and eventually leading to Gregor's death and Anatoly being inaugurated as Pakhan in his place.

Some of the more specialist courses are run under the auspices of the EU Training Project in Civilian Crisis Management. PeaceworkersSimulations PeaceworkersSimulations provide a means to assess people against commonly agreed minimum standards of professional competence. Observing people‚Äôs responses under simulated field conditions provides the basis for assessments at five levels of competency across a wide range of fieldwork categories. PeaceworkersResearch The aim of PeaceworkersResearch is to establish a body of knowledge about what has or has not \\"worked\\" in different situations of violent conflict. Research activities include field-based personnel assessments and surveys as well as in-house data analysis, tapping into a comprehensive network of individuals and organisations in the field. Why best placed: Peaceworkers UK is best placed to do this work because it has been developing this integrated programme of recruitment, training and assessment for the past five years and has built up an unparalleled understanding of the personal qualities, skills and knowledge needed to work effectively across a range of work categories in this field. It has already begun developing and obtaining wide agreement on a set of appropriate occupational standards together with a tried and tested methodology for training and assessing people against those standards. It has the capacity, the human resources and the know-how to achieve these objectives and is in the strongest possible position to help governments, United Nations agencies and Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to make a real difference to the lives of millions unable to escape the causes and consequences of violent conflict in so many parts of the world. Partners Alert's PeaceworkersUK works with a wide range of partners in the UK and Europe as well as in the rest of the world. Our closest UK partners are Saferworld, Electoral Reform International Services (ERIS), and RedR. As a member of the Peace & Security Liaison Group we also work closely with a number of other UK- based organisations working for the prevention, management and resolution of violent conflict around the world. As a member of the European Network of Civil Peace Services, PWUK also works closely with partner organisations sharing similar aims in ten other European countries. We have partnerships with organisations working directly on their own situations of violent conflict or its aftermath in Chechnya, Moldova, Turkey, Croatia, and Georgia. Outside Europe, PWUK has a special link with the 93 member organisations of the Nonviolent Peaceforce as well as with a few specific organisations with which we have worked in Nepal, Palestine, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Zimbabwe.

It was one of the most important shows of Belgrade's \\"202\\" station and possibly also the most important project of its host. It first aired first June 3, 1979. Zoran Modli was its host until late 1987. He later hosted another similar show, Modulacije. \\"Ventilator 202\\" was renamed to \\"501\\" and hosted by Dubravka Markoviƒá, giving it her own style. It was notable for its promotion of local (domestic) demo music, early application of computers and introduction of \\"absolute radio\\" concept. Ventilator 202 was a show done differently from other contemporary radio shows in Yugoslavia. Zoran Modli was not only the show's host but also operated the mixing console and other equipment himself. Essentially he was also a disc jockey. During the second half of the 1980s, Ventilator 202 broadcast computer software recorded on cassette tapes for popular home computers Galaksija, ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64. Demo Music A number of other contemporary radio shows broadcast demo music made by young bands but failed to gain popularity. Zoran Modli took a different approach with Ventilator 202. Instead of playing solely demo music he interleaved it with hits of the time, as equal. The show gained such popularity that it became a great starting point for young musicians and a way to hear an alternative to established sound. Ventilator 202 had no shortage of demo tapes coming in, from the entire Yugoslavia of the time. The popularity eventually lead to the idea that actual albums (vinyl records and cassette tapes) can be released with the best of the best. With the help of Du≈°an Panƒçiƒá, Ventilator 202 released the first \\"Demo Top 10\\" album in April 1983, soon to be followed by a second one in November 1983. The last, third, album created by the original team was released Spring 1985.

The host would announce the details of the software about to be broadcast (title, type of computer, etc.). Ready listeners would then engage their tape recorders and record the characteristic noise that would have turned unsuspecting listeners away. This initiative became so popular that special software was made specifically for the show, such as the flight simulator and \\"Velika Akcija\\" (Great Action) games and an early electronic journal. The journal was broadcast as the entire program used to view it. Ventilator 202 also featured computer professionals and publicists talking about various interesting subjects. Frequent speakers were Vladimir Ajdaƒçiƒá, Mi≈°a Milosavljeviƒá, Gavrilo Vuƒçkoviƒá, Jovan Regasek, Tansije Gavranoviƒá, Zoran ≈Ωivkoviƒá, Aca Milinkoviƒá and Dejan Ristanoviƒá.

They are intended to supply debris-free water without harming aquatic life. Fish screens are typically installed to protect endangered species of fishes that would otherwise be harmed or killed when passing through industrial facilities such as steam electric power plants, hydroelectric generators, petroleum refineries, chemical plants, farm irrigation water and municipal drinking water treatment plants. However, many fish are killed or injured on screens or elsewhere in the intake structures. Design=Industrial facilities Fish screens may be positive barriers (devices such as a perforated metal plate that physically prevents fish from passing) or behavioral barriers (devices that encourage fish to swim away). Most behavioral barriers are experimental and of unproven effectiveness. Diagram of typical vertical traveling screens used with industrial cooling water intake structures Positive barriers are often effective at keeping aquatic organisms from entering a cooling system, but may also kill them by impinging them on the screens. These barrier types are widely used and include: * Modified traveling screens * Fish handling and return systems * Horizontal, flat-plate screens with bypass water return systems * Cylindrical wedgewire screens * Fine-mesh screens * Fish net barriers. Besides simply preventing fish from passing, fish screens are designed to minimize stress and injury that occur when fish impact the screen or are subjected to changes in water velocity and direction caused by the diversion. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has evaluated other barrier technologies and identified some as potentially effective, although not widely demonstrated (as of 2004): * Aquatic microfiltration barriers * Angled and modular inclined screens * Velocity caps. Some fish screens are designed to protect a single species of fish (for example, salmon) and are not necessarily effective at protecting other fish species. Some screens are capable of protecting more than one species or type of life. Additionally, some screens may effectively protect juvenile and adult fish, but not fish eggs and larvae.EPA (2002). \\"National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System‚ÄîProposed Regulations to Establish Requirements for Cooling Water Intake Structures at Phase II Existing Facilities; Proposed Rule.\\" . 2002-04-09. The cost of a fish screen varies from thousands of US dollars for small, low-flow- rate screens to millions of US dollars in the case of very large custom- designed systems that filter a large flow of water. Maintenance costs can be significant, including repairs, removing trash, and adjusting the equipment for changes in stream conditions. Non-industrial applications For some low volume, non-industrial water diversion applications, there are screens available that have no moving parts, do not require electricity, and have very little need for maintenance. Impacts on aquatic life The Indian Point Energy Center in New York. Over a billion fish eggs and larvae are killed in its cooling system each year. Many power plants and other industries in the U.S. continue to use screens that impinge fish. For example, the cooling system at the Indian Point Energy Center in New York kills over a billion fish eggs and larvae annually. At the Bay Shore Power Plant in Ohio, 46 million fish were killed over an 18-month period. Organisms that pass through the screens are killed or stressed (depending on the species) as they become entrained in the cooling system. 208 million fish eggs and over 2 billion small and larval fish were entrained at the Bay Shore plant over the same 18 months. EPA estimates that billions of fish and other organisms are killed each year in cooling water intakes. Legal requirements In the United States, the National Marine Fisheries Service, a division of NOAA, mandates positive-barrier fishscreens in most new diversions from waterways where endangered or threatened fish species occur. Some existing unscreened diversions whose construction pre-dates fish-screen mandates are allowed to continue operating by grandfather rule. The U.S. Clean Water Act requires EPA to issue regulations on industrial cooling water intake structures.Clean Water Act, Section 316(b), .

The project is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and has been operating out of the NIAID Microbial Sequencing Center at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR, which in 2006 became The Venter Institute). Sequence information generated by the project has been continually placed into the public domain through GenBank. Origins In late 2003, David Lipman, Lone Simonsen, Steven Salzberg, and a consortium of other scientists wrote a proposal to begin sequencing large numbers of influenza viruses at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). Prior to this project, only a handful of flu genomes were publicly available. Their proposal was approved by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and would later become the IGSP. New technology development led by Elodie Ghedin began at TIGR later that year, and the first publication describing > 100 influenza genomes appeared in 2005 in the journal Nature (as PDF Research goals The project makes all sequence data publicly available through GenBank, an international, NIH-funded, searchable online database. This research helps to provide international researchers with the information needed to develop new vaccines, therapies and diagnostics, as well as improve understanding of the overall molecular evolution of Influenza and other genetic factors that determine their virulence. Such knowledge could not only help mitigate the impact of annual influenza epidemics, but could also improve scientific knowledge of the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses. Results The project completed its first genomes in March 2005 and has rapidly accelerated since. By mid-2008, over 3000 isolates had been completely sequenced from influenza viruses that are endemic in human (\\"human flu\\") avian (\\"bird flu\\") and swine (\\"swine flu\\") populations, including many strains of H3N2 (human), H1N1 (human), and H5N1 (avian). Affiliations The project is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) which is a component of the NIH, which is an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The IGSP has expanded to include a growing list of collaborators, who have contributed both expertise and valuable collections of influenza isolates. Key early contributors included Peter Palese of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, Jill Taylor of the Wadsworth Center at the New York State Department of Health, Lance Jennings of Canterbury Health Laboratories (New Zealand), Jeff Taubenberger of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (who later moved to NIH), Richard Slemons of Ohio State University and Rob Webster of St. Jude's Children's Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. In 2006 the project was joined by Ilaria Capua of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (in Italy), who contributed a valuable collection of avian flu isolates (including multiple H5N1 strains). Some of these avian isolates were described in a publication in Emerging Infectious Diseases in 2007. Nancy Cox from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Robert Couch from Baylor College of Medicine also joined the project in 2006, contributing over 150 influenza B isolates.

She was known for a postmodern approach to her fiction, which is often imbued with fantasy or magic. Several of her novels give a feminist or dreamlike twist to classic stories such as Two Women of London: The Strange Case of Ms Jekyll and Mrs Hyde (from Robert Louis Stevenson‚Äôs The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde). She also published work under the name Catherine Aydy.Peter Lewis, updated by Judson Knight, \\"Emma (Christina) Tennant Biography\\", JRank. Early life Tennant was of Scottish extraction, the daughter of Christopher Grey Tennant, 2nd Baron Glenconner, and Elizabeth Lady Glenconner (n√©e Powell). She remembered her father as a mix of rage and benevolence. She was the niece of Edward Wyndham Tennant and Stephen Tennant, and the half-sister of Colin Tennant, later the third Baron Glenconner, from her father's first marriage. Born in London, she spent the World War II years at the family's faux Gothic mansion The Glen in Peeblesshire. Her parents were regularly absent, while The Glen \\"was the strangest possible place. I knew no other world at all until I was nine\\". The family then resettled in London. Tennant was educated at St Paul's Girls' School, but left when she was 15. She spent some time at an Oxford finishing school, studying languages and the history of art, and a year in Paris at The Louvre. Career Tennant worked as a travel writer for Queen magazine and an editor for Vogue. Her first novel, The Colour of Rain, was published under a pseudonym when she was 26. Submitted to the Spanish Prix Formentor, the response of the chair of the judges, the Italian novelist Alberto Moravia meant that she suffered writer's block for some years afterwards. According to Tennant, he \\"tossed my book into a wastepaper basket and declared, 'This book stands for the decadence of British contemporary culture'.\\" It was not until 1973 that her second novel, The Time of the Crack, was first published. Between 1975 and 1979, she edited a literary magazine, Bananas, which helped launch the careers of several young novelists. She was the editor the Viking series Lives of Modern Women.Eyre, Charlotte (23 January 2017), \\"Author Emma Tennant dies\\", The Bookseller. A large number of books by Tennant followed: thrillers, children‚Äôs books, fantasies, and several revisionist takes on classic novels, including a sequel to Pride and Prejudice called Pemberley. In later years, she began to treat her own life in such books as Girlitude and Burnt Diaries (both published in 1999), the second of which details her affair with Ted Hughes. \\"He was so odd ‚Äì to put it mildly\\", she wrote. The French Dancer's Bastard, which recounts the life of Adele, the daughter of Mr Rochester from Jane Eyre, was published in October 2006. The Autobiography of the Queen, written with Hilary Bailey, was published in October 2007. Personal life Tennant was married four times, including to the journalist and author Christopher Booker between 1963 and 1968 and the political writer Alexander Cockburn between 13 December 1968 and 1973. She had one son and two daughters. Her son is the author Matthew Yorke, from her first marriage. Her older daughter Daisy, from her marriage to Cockburn, teaches the Alexander technique. Her younger daughter Rose Dempsey, from a relationship with publisher Michael Dempsey, works for the Serpentine Galleries. A lifelong supporter of the Labour Party, in April 2008 she married her partner of 33 years, Tim Owens, saying it was not, or not only, for tax policies introduced by the government of Gordon Brown. Emma Tennant died on 21 January 2017, in a London hospital, from posterior cortical atrophy, a form of Alzheimer's disease.

There are traditionally said to be seven hills in Edinburgh in reference to the Seven hills of Rome, but this figure is debatable, and as the city has expanded, even more so. It is a long ridge shaped hill, mostly forested (\\"Corstorphine Woods\\") with broad leaves, and has extensive development on its south side, including Edinburgh Zoo. Much housing has been built on the lower slopes, and houses in other parts of the city have been built using stone quarried from Corstorphine Hill. Barnton Quarry, at the north end of the hill, was the site of a war-time radar station and cold-war nuclear bunker. Part of the hill is adjacent to the neighbourhood of Clerwood where there is a walled garden (); it was featured on the BBC TV programme The Beechgrove Garden and it was awarded the first Green Pennant Award in Scotland in July 2009. On the east slope is Murrayfield Golf Course and the suburb of Craigcrook. On the top are two radio masts, and also a tower dedicated to Sir Walter Scott. There is also some evidence of ancient settlement here, possibly a hillfort of some kind. Cup marks have been found on the hill.

Taxonomy and systematics Recent DNA analysis has shown that there is some confusion regarding the traditional classification of the species in the genus Microsciurus, and that the genus may be polyphyletic. Currently, there are four species recognized: *Central American dwarf squirrel (Microsciurus alfari) Allen, 1895, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, northern Colombia *Amazon dwarf squirrel (Microsciurus flaviventer) Gray, 1867, western Amazon basin *Western dwarf squirrel (Microsciurus mimulus) Thomas, 1898, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama *Santander dwarf squirrel (Microsciurus santanderensis) Hern√°ndez-Camacho, 1957, central Colombia Description With a typical head-and-body length of about and a long tail, dwarf squirrels are relatively small. However, the Neotropical pygmy squirrel, not in this genus, is much smaller than these species, as are certain squirrels in Africa and Asia. Microsciurus species have gray or brown backs, and white bellies. Distribution and habitat All dwarf squirrels in this genus live in tropical rain forests. Estimates of their abundance are limited.

Biography Gaggi was born to Angelo and Mary Gaggi, Gaggi was the youngest of three children. Gaggi had a sister Marie, and a brother known as \\"Roy\\". Angelo emigrated to the United States from Palermo, Sicily, Italy and ran a barbershop on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Mary worked as a seamstress until Gaggi's birth.Gene Mustain & Jerry Capeci, Murder Machine (Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England: Penguin Books, 1993), page 5. Gaggi dropped out of school during the eighth grade and followed his father into the barber business. He also earned extra money delivering flowers, which he used for gambling. It was at this age that Gaggi learned the profitability of loan sharking to gamblers.Gene Mustain & Jerry Capeci, Murder Machine (Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England: Penguin Books, 1993), 7-8. When Gaggi was a young teenager, his family moved to New Jersey after purchasing a small farm. When Gaggi turned 17 in 1942, he attempted to join the United States Army, but was rejected due to myopia. In 1943, Gaggi's family left the farm and moved to the Bath Beach area of Brooklyn. Angelo resumed work as a barber while his mother and sister worked in a dress factory. Discharged from the Army due to injury, Roy sold peanut dispensers to bars.Gene Mustain & Jerry Capeci, Murder Machine (Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England: Penguin Books, 1993), 8-9. After returning to New York, Gaggi decided to pursue criminal activities. His father's cousin was mobster Frank Scalise, a founding member of the Gambino crime family. Scalise helped Gaggi obtain a job at a truck dock, where he quickly became a supervisor. Scalise eventually allowed Gaggi to become a \\"ghost employee\\", someone who did not have to work. Gaggi could devote all his time to loan sharking in Brooklyn bars and pool halls. This \\"no show\\" job also allowed him to report legitimate, taxable income to the IRS and avoid prosecution for tax evasion.Gene Mustain & Jerry Capeci, Murder Machine (Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England: Penguin Books, 1993), 9-10. Dominick Montiglio In 1947, Gaggi's sister Marie gave birth to Dominick Montiglio. Her husband, and Montiglio's father, was boxer and deliveryman Anthony Santamaria. However, Gaggi was the dominant personality in the household, eventually leading to Santamaria's estrangement from his family. Gaggi soon became Montiglio's surrogate father. When he became older, Montiglio joined his uncle in criminal activities and eventually testified in court about them.Gene Mustain & Jerry Capeci, Murder Machine (Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England: Penguin Books, 1993), 10. In 1954, after his first arrest, Gaggi was charged with running an international auto theft ring. Operating out of a used car lot in Brooklyn, the ring was backed by Scalise, now the Gambino boss. For two years, Gaggi and two associates fabricated false vehicle registrations for nonexistent Cadillacs. The gang stole cars that matched the phony vehicle descriptions and replaced their original Vehicle Identification Numbers with new fake numbers. They also gave the vehicles new license plates that matched the falsified registrations. The ring then sold the stolen vehicles in Florida, Georgia, Texas and Mexico. Gaggi married in 1955 while his auto theft trial was underway. During his trial, witnesses \\"forgot\\" their testimony on the witness stand and Gaggi's co-defendants refused to testify against him. In early 1956, Gaggi was acquitted. Later that year, Gaggi became a father. His wife and child now lived on the first floor of the three-story Gaggi house. In 1957, the Gambino family underwent a dramatic change in leadership. In June, Scalise was shot and killed at a fruit stand in the Bronx. In October, Gambino boss Albert Anastasia was shot to death in a barber's chair at a Manhattan hotel. Immediately after the Anastasia murder, Gaggi ordered his family to stay home for a few days. Gaggi's close associate, underboss Carlo Gambino, became the new boss. He appointed caporegime Aniello Dellacroce, an Anastasia loyalist, as underboss and gave him control over the Manhattan faction of the family. In October 1960, Gaggi committed his first murder for the Gambino family. He served on a hit squad that murdered mobster Vincent Squillante, who is suspected of killing Scalise. According to Montiglio, Gaggi described the murder: ‚ÄúWe surprised him (Squillante) in the Bronx. We shot him in the head, stuffed him in the trunk, then dumped him for good.‚Äù In this case, ‚Äúdumped him for good‚Äù meant that they hauled the body to the basement of a building, loaded it into a trash incinerator, and cremated it. After the Squillante murder, Gaggi was inducted into the Gambino family. DeMeo crew By the mid-1960s, Gaggi had established a large clientele of loan shark customers and was also a silent partner in several businesses. He started to dominate the organized crime world. To increase his earnings, he partnered with mobster Roy DeMeo, who was running a stolen car ring in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Flatlands and Canarsie. DeMeo had connections with the Lucchese crime family and a reputation as a capable and resourceful earner. Gaggi persuaded DeMeo to leave the Luccheses and work instead for the Gambinos. Gaggi and DeMeo began making co-loans to loan shark customers. By 1970, DeMeo was officially working for Gaggi and paying him weekly tributes. In 1972, the two men forced their way into a partnership with a company that illegally processed X-rated films. After law enforcement raided the company in 1973, owner Paul Rothenberg began to cooperate with them. Gaggi ordered DeMeo to murder Rothenberg, whose body was found with bullet wounds shortly thereafter. The Rothenberg killing was the first of many murders committed by DeMeo's crew. While Gaggi was not involved in most of these killings, he did participate in some of them. DeMeo and Gaggi shot and killed Vincent Governara, a young man with no mob ties, over a fight between him and Gaggi that had occurred twelve years before. In 1976, DeMeo killed George Byrum, an electrical contractor, who had tipped off thieves who attempted to burglarize Gaggi's Florida vacation home without knowing Gaggi and his wife were present. Under Gaggi's direction, DeMeo shot and killed Byrum in a Miami hotel room while Gaggi and another mobster, Tony Plate, attempted to dismember the body. However, they were interrupted by a construction crew outside the room that was repairing a faulty air conditioning unit, causing them to flee. The bloody corpse of George Byrum was later found by the motel maid. In late 1976, boss Carlo Gambino died of natural causes. Before his death, he had designated Paul Castellano, his brother-in-law and head of the family's Brooklyn faction, as the new boss. However, the Manhattan faction favored Dellacroce. At a leadership meeting held at Gaggi's house, it was agreed that Castellano would become the new Gambino boss while Dellacroce was retained as underboss. Gaggi was promoted to capo of Castellano's old crew. Gaggi remained close to Castellano, hoping to become promoted to underboss. Gaggi proposed that DeMeo be admitted into the family, but Castellano hesitated, initially because he felt DeMeo was too violent and uncontrollable. In the summer of 1977, Castellano relented and allowed DeMeo into the family. During this period, DeMeo successfully formed an alliance between the Gambino family and the Westies, a gang of Irish- American criminals that dominated Hell's Kitchen. DeMeo continued to expand his many illegal activities and passed more money over to Gaggi. Meanwhile, Gaggi expanded his loan sharking business, with a large loan he secured from Montiglio, now a Gambino associate, in charge of collecting payments from DeMeo and Gaggi's customers. Montiglio's close involvement in nearly all facets of Gaggi's criminal activities, particularly with the DeMeo crew, would bring heavy repercussions for Gaggi in the mid-1980s. On June 7, 1978, Gaggi and nine other mobsters were charged with racketeering, conspiracy, and fraud charges as a result of a year-long federal investigation into the bankruptcy of a theatre in New York. The majority of the evidence in this case came from wiretapped conversations; fortunately for Gaggi, he never said anything incriminating. In December 1978, Gaggi was cleared of all charges.\\"The Region: A Defendant Clear In Theater Fraud\\". (December 14, 1978). The New York Times Eppolito murders By 1979, DeMeo was involved in loan sharking, murder- for-hire, and the operation of an auto theft ring that shipped cars to the Middle East. Gaggi received a large percentage of profits from these rackets, along with money from DeMeo's drug trafficking. The DeMeo crew sold cocaine, marijuana, and a variety of pills in large amounts. DeMeo continued his drug trade despite a public prohibition that Castellano had made against this type of racket. Gambino capo James Eppolito told Castellano that Gaggi and DeMeo were trafficking drugs. Eppolito claimed that DeMeo had cheated Eppolito's son, a Gambino soldato, in a drug deal. In addition, Eppolito accused Gaggi of being a police informant. Eppolito asked for permission to murder Gaggi and DeMeo, but Castellano broke his own rules and sided with them. Instead, he gave Gaggi and DeMeo permission to murder both Eppolito and his son. On October 1, 1979, Gaggi and DeMeo shot and killed both Eppolitos. However, a witness alerted an off-duty policeman, who soon found Gaggi walking away from the crime scene (DeMeo had gone in a different direction). After a brief shootout, the policeman wounded Gaggi in the neck and arrested him. Although charged with the murders, and the attempted murder of the police officer, Gaggi was only convicted of assault. He was sentenced to 5 to 15 years in federal prison. While Gaggi was in prison, DeMeo became acting capo of Gaggi's crew. In 1981, Gaggi's sentence was overturned on appeal and he was released from prison. Gaggi had bribed a juror to make false claims of government misconduct during the trial. Downfall After Gaggi's release, Montiglio had become a drug addict and fled New York for fear of punishment from the Gambino family. The FBI dismantled DeMeo's auto theft ring and sent two crew members to prison. In 1980, a third crew member, Vito Arena, became a government witness. In 1982, Arena began testifying about crimes committed by Gaggi and the DeMeo crew. As the investigation intensified, Castellano became concerned about DeMeo cooperating with authorities if he were arrested. On January 20, 1983, DeMeo's body was found nearly frozen in the trunk of his car. DeMeo's killer was never identified, but law enforcement theorized that Castellano had him killed by either Gaggi or remaining DeMeo crew members. Conversely, in Philip Carlo's 2009 book, Ice Man: Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer, Carlo reported that serial killer and Mafia hitman Richard Kuklinski (known as \\"Ice Man\\") was the lone gunman who killed DeMeo while riding in DeMeo's car together. Kuklinski, who had begun taking contract killing work from DeMeo after establishing a mutually beneficial criminal relationship, had been humiliated publicly by DeMeo on a number of occasions and sought revenge. Kuklinski had a first meeting with DeMeo and his men, where they administered a savage beating to Kuklinski, while collecting late payments he had owed to Mob members in his pornography business. DeMeo had thought that \\"he took the beating like a man\\", and soon they became business associates with DeMeo giving Kuklinski contracts to carry out. On another occasion, Carlo writes, during a meeting at DeMeo's Gemini Lounge, for reasons unknown, a smirking DeMeo pulled a cocked Uzi submachine gun on Kuklinski during a lunch with him and asked him if \\"he wanted to die today.\\" The beating over the late payments was the original humiliation which sent Kuklinski on the road to eventually killing DeMeo, and the Uzi incident was further goading toward the Iceman. Kuklinski, in jailhouse interviews, has indicated he was the sole killer of Roy DeMeo. Shortly after DeMeo's murder, Montiglio returned to New York to collect an old loan shark debt and was arrested. To avoid prosecution, Montiglio started cooperating with the government, providing information on Gaggi and the DeMeo crew. Montiglio's information led to the indictments of both Gaggi and Castellano. By early 1984, some of the DeMeo crew members were arrested. One of them, Richard DiNome, was later murdered on February 4, 1984. As with DeMeo, DiNome's killers were never identified, but law enforcement assumed they were the remaining DeMeo crew members. DiNome's brother, Frederick DiNome, also suspected the DeMeo crew of killing Richard and agreed to become a government witness. On February 25, Gaggi was indicted on multiple charges of racketeering and murder. Castellano was indicted the following month. The court decided to split the numerous charges against both men into two trials. The first trial would be dealing with the auto theft ring and five related murders. The first trial began in October 1985 and saw testimony from Arena, DiNome, and Montiglio. In December 1985, midway through the trial, Castellano was shot to death at the Sparks Steak House in Manhattan on orders from capo John Gotti. With Castellano's death, Gaggi became the lead defendant in the first trial. Gotti quickly assumed control of the family. In March 1986, Gaggi was convicted of conspiracy to sell stolen cars, and was sentenced to five years in Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary. In 1988, Nino was transferred from Lewisburg to the Metropolitan Correction Center for his second trial. The second trial would focus on Gaggi's racketeering acts and on the 25 murders allegedly committed by the DeMeo crew. Death On April 17, 1988, while awaiting his second trial, Gaggi died of a heart attack. Gaggi had told a guard that he was suffering chest pain, but the guard did nothing. It was widely speculated that Gaggi might have survived his heart attack if prison personnel had acted sooner and sent him to the hospital. Gaggi's wife successfully sued the prison system for negligence, assisted by testimony from several other inmates. Gaggi's death sparked a controversy that eventually resulted in better medical conditions in New York City prisons. Media Montiglio provided writers Jerry Capeci and Gene Mustaine information on Gaggi and the DeMeo crew for their book Murder Machine. In both the book and the television documentaries, Montiglio blamed his criminal actions on Gaggi's bad influence. In the movie The Iceman, a fictionalized version of Gaggi, named Leo Marks, is a high-ranking member in the Gambino crime family and is killed by Richard Kuklinski.

In its short run, the series dealt with such topics as politics, racial segregation, drug addiction, and mortality. In his review of the series, Variety critic Brian Lowry wrote that \\"at its best, the show seems to ape the work of film director Ralph Bakshi by using an animated setting to explore adult themes\\", and that \\"the bland central character and cartoonish elements [...] will likely be off-putting to many adults, who won't find the political satire biting enough to merit their continued attention. Similarly, kids probably won't be as smitten with the cartoon aspects or look.\\" Despite the show's short run, Capitol Critters inspired Burger King Kids Club toys in 1992, which featured Jammet, Max, Muggle, and a Presidential Cat sitting on or emerging from miniature Washington D.C. monuments. Also in 1992, Nintendo planned to adapt the TV series into a video game for the Super NES, but the game was cancelled for unknown reasons.

Among her supporters, she is known as Khru Prateep (\\"Teacher Prateep\\"), the \\"Angel of Khlong Toei\\" or \\"Slum Angel\\". She was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service in 1978, founded and became the Secretary General of the Duang Prateep Foundation. She was one of the leaders of the 1992 oppositional movement. In 2000, she was elected to the Senate, representing Bangkok.  Life  Prateep Ungsongtham was born in a slum in Bangkok's Klong Toei district. Her father was a fisherman immigrated from China, her mother was Thai. As her parents lived in an illegally erected home, she had no birth certificate and was denied admission to a public school. For four years she could visit a relatively cheap private school. She had to drop out when she was 12 years old and her parents ran out of money. She started working on the docks of the Bangkok port, packing firecrackers and scraping rust off ships' hulls. She saved money from her meagre wages (about one baht per day) and at 15 she was able to pay for secondary education at an evening school. Because most slum children, like her, could not go to a regular school, Prateep opened her own One Baht a Day School at her home. She spent much time helping children and their families to cope with the conditions of slum life. When the slum dwellers were threatened with eviction by the Port Authority of Thailand (PAT) which wanted to expand its facilities in 1972, a Bangkok Post reporter interviewed Prateep and her cause was publicly known. Her school received donations from private individuals, foreign embassies and the Bangkok Bank. Thammasat University students came to support her as voluntary teachers. Eventually, the PAT had to agree to a compromise solution and made a new site available 1 km away. In 1974, the school opened a real school building, and in 1976 it was officially recognised by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, which also revised its policy towards children without birth certificate. In the same year, Prateep received her diploma of education from Suan Dusit Teachers College. In 1978 Prateep received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service.Biography of Prateep Ungsongtham-Hata , Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation She used the prize money to establish the Duang Prateep Foundation (DPF; \\"flame of hope\\") and became its Secretary General. Now, she began to also receive recognition from the establishment. Queen Sirikit congratulated her upon receiving the Magsaysay Award. In 1980, the Ministry of Education (which once had opposed her efforts) named her the most outstanding teacher of Thailand. In 1981, she became the first Asian citizen to receive the John D. Rockefeller III Youth Award for \\"outstanding contribution to Mankind\\". With the prize money she established the Foundation for Slum Child Care.Foundation for Slum Child Care (FSCC) In the same year, Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda visited the slums and her school. In 1987 she married the Japanese citizen Mr. Tatsuya Hata. In 1992 she became a committee member of the Confederation for Democracy and one of the leaders of the opposition to the then ruling military-sponsored government of General Suchinda Kraprayoon, that led to the bloody clashes of \\"Black May\\" and the eventual resignation of Suchinda. In Thailand's first direct election of the Senate in the year 2000, she won a seat in this chamber of parliament. She used her position to advocate the rights of the poor and discriminated people on political level. In 2004 she received The World's Children's Prize for the Rights of the Child from Queen Silvia of Sweden. After the coup d'√©tat in Thailand 2006, she became a supporter of the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (\\"Red Shirts\\"). During the protests of 2010, she belonged to the more moderate wing of the movement and was concerned to see the militant tendencies within the group. Her commitment to the \\"Red Shirts\\" and the political polarisation in Thailand led to a decline of donations for her Duang Prateep Foundation from within the country. Some regular donors who are affiliated with the opposite political camp refused to give to an organisation headed by a \\"Red Shirt\\" and stopped their payments.

Biography He was educated at Yale under Timothy Dwight IV, graduating in 1815, then studied at Princeton Theological Seminary under Dr. Archibald Alexander and Samuel Miller. He became assistant to Rev. Joseph Lathrop at the West Springfield, Massachusetts, Congregational church in 1819. The following year, when Lathrop died after sixty years as pastor there, Sprague became senior minister and served there nine more years. Thereafter, he accepted a call to pastor the Second Presbyterian Church, Albany, New York, where Edward Norris Kirk had been an assistant, and where Sprague ministered for forty years. Sprague wrote numerous books, including Lives of Rev. Edward Dorr Griffin, D. D, (1838), Timothy Dwight (1845), and Rev. Jedidiah Morse (1874), his greatest contribution to literature being his Annals of the American Pulpit, an invaluable compilation of Trinitarian Congregationalist, Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist, Episcopalian, Unitarian Congregationalist, and other biographies. Although no edition of his collected works ever was published, Sprague's published individual sermons, discourses, and addresses in pamphlet form exceed 150 in number. Sprague was also a collector of historical documents and pamphlets and became the first person ever to gather a complete set of the autographs of the signers of the United States Declaration of Independence. He completed this task by February, 1833, according to correspondence with friend Jared Sparks at about that time. He also gathered a collection of the signatures of all of the members of the Convention which framed the Constitution of the United States in 1787, and a complete set of the autographs of the Presidents of the United States and all the officers of the United States government during the administrations of Presidents Washington, John Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe and John Quincy Adams. This latter collection included signatures of the Presidents, Vice Presidents, all the members of the President‚Äôs Cabinet, and all of the Justices of the United States Supreme Court and all of the foreign ministers. Further, he collected the signatures of all the military officers involved in the American revolutionary war, from all nations, during the whole war. He collected signatures of great men of the Reformation and great skeptics. He even owned a copy of the autograph of Saint Augustine.

The freeway's path would have begun at the I-5/I-405 interchange near the Fremont Bridge's east approach. From the elevated stack interchange, it would transition to grade, moving roughly northeast to Prescott Street. To establish a northern cross-town freeway belt, a second section of freeway was to follow NE Prescott Street east to I-205. Although functionally the same freeway, this section was going to be named the Prescott Freeway. A successful freeway revolt surrounding the controversial St. Helens Freeway (I-505) and Mount Hood Freeway in the late 1970s impacted all Portland area freeway plans. Remnants The present north I-405/I-5 interchange is actually an incomplete full stack interchange. A short section of freeway was built past the interchange which transitioned to grade. Ramp stubs exist which would have connected both northbound and southbound I-5 to the eastbound Rose City Freeway. Also the NB I-5 to SB I-405 ramp was built with enough clearance to allow installation of the extra ramps needed to make a full connection to the planned freeway. All of this was built along with the Fremont Bridge, which opened in 1973. The unfinished freeway structure now serves as the Kerby Avenue exit on the Fremont Bridge's lower deck.

He continued his studies in Paris, France, with such masters as Darius Milhaud, Louis Saguer and Max Deutsch. He was a teacher of theory and composition himself at the Royal Conservatory of Music and York University. Glick is one of Canada's most prolific composers, having written in all media from chamber music to oratorio. He won numerous awards including the extraordinary Yuvel Award in 2000, presented by The Cantor's Assembly of America, for his \\"lifelong commitment to the composition of music that captures the heart and touches the soul\\" ;the prestigious Ateret Kavod (Crown of Honour) Award in 2001 from the United Synagogue of America.

In 1914, he became the co-founder and first dean of the University of Oregon's School of Architecture and Allied Arts, a position he held until his death. Lawrence concurrently served as campus architect for the University of Oregon and designed many campus buildings, including Knight Library and the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art. Lawrence Hall on the university campus (which replaced his Architecture and Art Building of 1923) was named in his honor in 1956. His body of over 500 projects includes churches, residences, commercial and industrial buildings, funerary buildings, multi-family residences, and public buildings. In 1988, the private residence he designed for Thomas A. Livesley, a prominent Salem, Oregon businessman and civic leader, was purchased through private donations and donated to the state and now serves as the Governor's official residence (Mahonia Hall).  Biography Ellis F. Lawrence was born in Malden, Massachusetts and received his secondary education at Phillips Academy, Andover, graduating in 1897. He received both his bachelor's and master's degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the first school of architecture in the United States. After graduation in 1902, Lawrence worked for several architectural firms then traveled in Europe. He was employed by the Boston architectural firm Codman & Despradelle in 1905. In 1906, Codman & Despradelle (Boston), sent Lawrence to San Francisco to commence work there, but the 1906 San Francisco earthquake convinced him to stay in Portland, Oregon where he had stopped on the way. He lived in Portland the rest of his life and commuted to his work as dean and campus architect in Eugene.Guide to the Ellis Lawrence papers at the University of Oregon He was associated with several Oregon-based architecture firms: MacNaughton, Raymond & Lawrence (1906‚Äì1910); Lawrence & Holford (1913‚Äì1928); Lawrence, Holford, Allyn & Bean (1928‚Äì1933); and Lawrence, Holford, & Allyn (1933‚Äì1941).

The site has been offline since 2018. History Before March 7, 2009, the domain name Poetry.com was owned by New Catalyst Fund (NCF). The site was previously run by a Maryland-based company called The International Library of Poetry, also known as the International Society of Poets and the International Poetry Hall of Fame. Poetry.com claimed to coordinate monthly poetry contests and other services through its website, though the actual competitive nature of these contests was disputed. The site's ostensible primary purpose was publication of poetry anthologies submitted by aspiring authors and poetry conventions hosted by the group. The Better Business Bureau of Greater Maryland classified the business as a vanity publisher and noted that the quality of the poetry submitted to them \\"does not appear to be a significant consideration for selection for publication.\\" On March 7, 2009, Lulu.com purchased the Poetry.com domain from NCF. (Publish Today and Noble House Publishing, the branches of Poetry.com that managed the publishing and printing of their books, subsequently went out of business.) Lulu renamed the site Lulu Poetry. They targeted it to poets who wanted to connect with their peers, to seek reviews and feedback, and to receive recognition, contest prizes and publishing assistance. In April 2011, Poetry.com was purchased by a New York-based group of private investors (Scott Tilson, Jeffrey Franz) from Lulu.com for undisclosed terms. The investors aimed to create an Internet-based creative social expression service, with the first acquisition being Poetry.com. In April 2012, Poetry.com was launched with 14 million archived poems, and reviews of poems were guaranteed in 60 minutes or less by the active community. By 2015, it had become a free-to-use site for amateur poets, where poets submitting to Poetry.com granted the site \\"royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right (including any moral rights) and license to use, license, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, derive revenue or other remuneration from, communicate to the public, perform and display the content (in whole or in part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed, for the full term of any Rights that may exist in such content.\\" In April 2018, Poetry.com went offline without explanation.  Criticism  Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, Inc. (SFWA) have criticized the International Library of Poetry's business model, describing its practices as \\"deceptive and misleading\\" in that they misrepresented their activities as a contest based on the quality of poetry submitted, whereas in fact the quality had little or no influence on the outcome. It was also accused of describing the anthologies it published as a \\"real literary credit that poets can be proud of\\" while simultaneously producing anthologies that were available on special order only and which were full of poor quality poetry. When poets receive their purchased volumes they are given a discount to ILP's convention and are told they are \\"semi-finalists\\" for a grand prize. All conference attendees are semi- finalists. Semi-finalists for their poetry contest have also discovered their anthologies are different from other volumes sent to other semi-finalists, featuring the buyer's work near the front with work from other semi-finalists missing. The Library of Congress lists Poetry.com as a vanity publisher. Poetry.com is not an accredited business with the Better Business Bureau, which has given the business an \\"F\\" rating. In 2004, the New York State Consumer Protection Board launched an investigation into ILP, which it said \\"takes advantage of people both emotionally and financially,\\" but it suspended the investigation due to a shortage of complaints. Other critics pointed out that standard industry practice was for winners of poetry contests to receive gratis copies of any publication of their work, and that ILP failed to follow this protocol.

Sterija was recognized by his contemporaries as the one of the leading Serbian intellectuals and he is regarded as one of the best comic playwrights in Serbian literature. Life Popoviƒá was born in Werschetz (Vr≈°ac), in the Temesch County of Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary (now Serbia). His father Sterija (meaning \\"star\\" in Greek), after whom he was nicknamed, was a Greek merchant., His maternal grandfather was known painter and poet Nikola Ne≈°koviƒá, whom he would later write the biography of. Popoviƒá attended grammar schools in Vr≈°ac, Karlowitz (Sremski Karlovci), Temeschwar (Timi»ôoara) and Ofenpesth (Budapest). He studied law at K√§smark (Ke≈æmarok). After he finished his studies (1830), he worked as a professor, and from 1835, when he passed his bar examination, he returned to his hometown where he first taught Latin, then opened his law practice. Like many other intellectuals of Vojvodina, driven by patriotic feelings, he decided to work in the Principality of Serbia. He began to write historical dramas but soon switched to comedy. In 1840 he went to Kragujevac to study at the pedagogic school of natural law. In the same year, he moved to Belgrade, where he would spend eight years, teaching at what was then the most advanced school in Serbia, Grande √âcole (Belgrade Higher School, future University). He was instrumental in founding the Serbian Academy of Sciences and the National Museum. He continued to write dramas, which he also organized, staged, and directed. He was appointed head of the Ministry of Education by the constitutional government in 1842. He remained in this position until 1848, working on organizing the school system and education in Serbia. His continued disagreement with the leading politicians of the day and ill health would soon force him to withdraw from public life. At the beginning of the same year (1848) he decided to tender his resignation and return to Vr≈°ac (1848-9 part of Serbian Vojvodina, 1849‚Äì60 Serbia and Temeschwar), where he lived till his death in 1856, deeply disappointed with people and life in general. He is buried at the Orthodox cemetery in Vr≈°ac. Drama Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá is undoubtedly one of the most significant figures of Serbian literature. With good reason he has been given the name \\"the father of Serbian drama\\". Following the example of the great French and German tragedians, he described events from the history of the Serbian people. The Belgrade theatre Theater on ƒêumruk opened with his tragedy Smrt Stefana Deƒçanskog in 1841. The first Sterija's tragedy Svetislav i Mileva is worth mentioning, then Milo≈° Obiliƒá ili Padnuƒáe serbskog carstva, Nesreƒáno supru≈æestvo ili Naod Simeon, Skenderbeg and Lahan. Mio≈°iƒá's poems about Skanderbeg from his most important work A Pleasant Discourse of the Slavic People were basis for ≈Ωivot i vite≈°ka voevanja slavnog kneza epirskog ƒêorƒëa Kastriota Skenderbega written by Sterija Popoviƒá in 1828. Sterija showed a real artistic value as the writer of comedies. His comedian talent has created strong and great literary works, which are even greater because it was, in fact, Sterija who paved the way to the Serbian comedy in general. The first period of Sterija's writing of comedies falls on the time of his life in Vr≈°ac, between 1830 and 1840. Sterija eternalized his home-town with the characters of Kir Janja, Fema Ru≈æiƒá and others. His comedies La≈æa i Parala≈æa (1830), Pokondirena tikva (1830), Tvrdica (1837) and Zla ≈æena (1838), have brought him the appreciation of his contemporaries and the reputation of being \\"Serbian Moli√®re\\". In 1841, 1842 and 1847 some less important Sterija's comedies were also performed: ≈Ωenidba i udadba, Simpatije i antipatije, Vol≈°ebni magarac, D≈æandrljiv mu≈æ, Sudbina jednog razuma, and Prevara za prevaru. His comedy Beograd nekad i sad which describes the environment of 19th century Belgrade was published in 1853. The last comedy Sterija wrote was the satire Rodoljupci. He did not print this important comedy at all, so it remained in manuscript long after his death. Sterija found the inspiration for this comedy in the revolutionary events of 1848‚Äì1849. Poetry Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá frequently returned to the theme: the discrepancy between what was being proclaimed and actual behaviour was always the focus of his criticism. In his poem Godine 1848 (Year 1848) it is the betrayal of the ideals of the American Revolution‚Äîlegal slavery in the land of the free; in Izobra≈æeniku (To an Enlightened One) it is the hypocrisy of those who condemn the Ottoman Empire as barbaric, while at the same time engaging in conquest and the slave trade themselves. Legacy Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá monument in the Russian park in Vr≈°ac Sterija was recognized by his contemporaries as the one of the leading Serbian intellectuals. He is regarded as one of the best comic playwrights in Serbian literature. Sterija's comedies are artistically authentic pictures of one part of the Serbian society in Vojvodina, in the first half of the 19th century. They bring a very rich gallery of characters. Sterija's comedies have passed the framework of their time, have gotten the everlasting value, and have become a part of the Serbian cultural inheritance. Diverse as a writer, Sterija also wrote satires, novels, dissertations about literature and language and reflexive poetry, published in the book Davorje which is considered to be one of the best books of reflexive poetry in the Serbian literature. Living in Serbia as Minister of Education, Sterija was the founder of The Society of Serbian Letters (now Serbian Academy of Science and Art) and the National Museum of Serbia. He laid the foundation of the modern Serbian school system and he was the author of many textbooks. A documentary about his life was produced in Yugoslavia in 1956.[] He is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs.

Johnson Nelson Trusler Johnson (April 3, 1887 - December 3, 1954) was the US Minister to China from 1929 to mid-September 1935. Then, until 1941, he was US Ambassador to the Republic of China and then to Australia from 1941 to 1945. Early life and career Johnson was born in the family row house located at 1st and East Capitol Streets (now a part of the location of the United States Supreme Court) in Washington, DC. He spent part of his early life in Newkirk, Oklahoma and then Kildare, Oklahoma. He then returned to Washington, DC, and graduated from Sidwell Friends School, near 8th Street and I Street NW, in 1906. He then went to George Washington University and pledged to the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. Near the end of his freshman year, he decided to take the Foreign Service Examination, claiming his residency as Oklahoma. During the summer of 1907 while working at the Library of Congress he prepared for the general exam and studied German to meet the language requirements. Shortly thereafter, at the age of twenty he received an appointment to the Foreign Service and departed for China. He spent his entire adult life in the service of his government. Johnson specialized in China and the rest of the Far East, He spent his first two years as a student interpreter during which time he engaged in an unorthodox language program in Peking where he learned to speak Chinese well. Beginning in 1909 at Mukden, he served in numerous posts as a consular officer. In 1925 he was appointed Chief of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs, next as Assistant Secretary of State (1927- end of 1929), then as Minister to China (the end of 1929 - Mid- September 1935), and Ambassador to China Mid-September 1935 - May 1941). Wishing to be united with his family he accepted a lesser post as minister to Australia during World War II (1941-1945).U.S. State Department, Office of the Historian. Influence on Far Eastern policy US Consulate in Shanghai in 1936 Johnson first became intimately involved in shaping American policy toward China in 1925 when he assumed the office of Chief of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs in the State Department. In 1929 he came to China as the U.S. Minister to China. His title was Minister, rather than Ambassador, because the U.S. Legation in China had not been raised to the status of an embassy. When in May 1935 Japan said that it planned to raise its Legation in China to the grade of embassy the U.S. moved to follow suit. Due to the required Senate confirmation Johnson did not officially become U.S. ambassador to China until mid-September 1935. Both as Minister and as Ambassador to China, Johnson provided the State Department with important communications that assisted the Coolidge, Hoover, and Roosevelt administrations determine their policies with respect to China and China's unsettled relationship with Japan and the Western powers. For example, during Japan's invasion of Manchuria, which began on the evening of September 18, 1931 near Mukden,Jay Taylor, The Generalissimo, 92-94 Johnson urged Hoover's Secretary of State, Stimson to avoid any appearance of siding with Japan, and to rather uphold the Nine-Power Treaty, which affirmed China's sovereignty. Far Eastern expert Dorothy Borg wrote, \\"Johnson's cable made a deep impression on Stimson...\\" Johnson made major contributions during the Coolidge, Hoover, and the early Roosevelt administrations. He favored going as far as American interests would allow in helping China regain its sovereignty, and he consistently guided US Secretaries of State Kellogg and Stimson on a moderate course in their policy. Johnson was Frank B. Kellogg's, Coolidge's Secretary of State, principal advisor on China policy. Johnson's recommendations were guided by an instinctive understanding that the rationale for and the time of imperialism was at an end. Consequently, he advocated that the United States and the world powers move toward restoring China's sovereignty as soon as possible. Johnson understood that revolution along with violence and disorder would likely be necessary in bringing about China's development. Kellogg and Johnson hoped that U.S. leadership in the restoration of China's sovereignty would result in retaining China's friendship. Johnson continually opposed interference in the civil war in China. He opposed joining the British at Canton and Hankow in punitive measures against Chinese strikers and other nationalists. He opposed harsh or recriminatory action against China during the Nanking Incident of 1927. He advocated conciliation in answering China's note of June 1925 requesting treaty revision. He suggested going as far as possible, unilaterally if necessary, in writing a new tariff treaty, and he favored gradual relinquishment of extraterritoriality. A new treaty between the United States and China was signed in July 1928 that granted China tariff autonomy and that contained mutual guarantees of most-favored-nation treatment. The treaty marked a milestone that symbolized Kellogg's and Johnson' quest to be China's friend and champion its sovereignty. Under Stimson, Johnson made a significant contribution when, as American Minister in China, he influenced Stimson's policy during the Manchurian incident, i.e., during Japan's invasion of Manchuria. His recommendation that the United States make a statement for upholding the terms of the Nine-Power Treaty left \\"a deep impression upon\\" Stimson and encouraged him \\"to pursue a course upon which he had already started\\" and which culminated in his letter to letter to US Senator William E. Borah, which was published on February 23, 1932. In the mid-1930s, Johnson's influence continued, but other officials gained ascendancy as policy became more oriented to Japan. He grew increasingly impatient with Japanese aggression and began suggesting a reappraisal of American policy toward Japan. While not yet recommending that the U.S. assume any responsibility for the Chinese, he still advocated rearmament and reconsideration of its intention to grant independence to the Philippines. By the end of the decade, Johnson openly advocated material support for China. The Chinese had then established a measure of order and had demonstrated a will to resist Japan and he believed they deserved support. His descriptions of the events of the war and of the valiant fight of the Chinese were instrumental in the decision to grant assistance to them. For example, when on October 18 ,1940 Chiang-Kai-shek informed the U.S. that a major increase in military assistance would be required to continue to resist Japan and accordingly requested 500 planes, volunteer American volunteer pilots to fly them, and a large loan, Johnson strongly supported Chiang's request. Johnson said that by fulfilling Chiang's request the U.S. would \\"move beyond \\"flimsy aid\\" and \\"callous and dangerous disregard\\" for China's precarious situation. FDR rejected Chiang's full request. But recognizing that something had to be done fast he told Treasury Secretary Morgenthau that it was \\"a matter of life and death,\\" and ordered Morgenthau and Under Secretary of State Welles to arrange a $100 million loan at once. Also, with FDR's full support Secretary of War Stimson and Chief of Staff Marshall diverted 100 pursuit planes from British orders and made them available for use in China, i.e., defending the Burma road.Robert Dallek, Franklin D.

Notably, for A-law and Œº-law codecs the standards define a sequence which has a 0 dBm0 output. Note 1: A consequence for the A-law and Œº-law codecs of the 0 dBm0 definition is that they have a respective 3.14 dBm0 and 3.17 dBm0 maximum signal level (ratio between the maximum obtainable sine wave amplitude and the specified reference 0 dBm0 sine wave amplitude). Note 2: 0 dBm0 is often replaced by or used instead of digital milliwatt or zero transmission level point. The \\"unit\\" dBm0 is used to describe levels of digital signals. E.g. the nominal downlink level in mobile phone telecommunication at the point of interconnection (POI) is -16 dBm0. The unit is derived from its counterpart dBm. Even though digitally represented signals have nothing to do with absolute power levels and cannot be expressed as dBm, the dinosaurs of telephonometrie had problems thinking in levels relative to full scale, so they introduced the completely redundant pseudo-digital unit of \\"dBm0\\". It actually connects both, the old world of analogue telecommunication and the new world of digital communication in a weird and unnatural way. The 0 dBm0 level corresponds to the digital milliwatt (DMW) and is defined as the absolute power level at a digital reference point of the same signal that would be measured as the absolute power level, in dBm, if the reference point was analog. The absolute power in dBm is defined as 10 log (power in mW/1 mW). When the test impedance is 600 Œ© resistive, dBm can be referred to a voltage of 775mV, which results in a reference active power of 1 mW. 0 dBm0 corresponds to an overload level of approximately 3 dBm in the A/D conversion. Given a sine signal of RMS Voltage of 0.775 [V], the Power at ZLP (zero transmission level point) in [W] is: P = \\\\frac{(0.775 [\\\\mathrm{V}])^2}{600 [\\\\Omega]} = 0.001 [\\\\mathrm{W}] = 1 [\\\\mathrm{mW}] = 0 [\\\\mathrm{dBm}] and the level at ZLP in [\\\\mathrm{dBV}] is: L = 10*\\\\log_{10}\\\\left( \\\\frac{0.775 [\\\\mathrm{V}]}{1 [\\\\mathrm{V}]} \\\\right)^2 \\\\approx -2.214 [\\\\mathrm{dBV}]. TIA-810 TIA/EIA 810-A, Transmission Requirements for Narrowband Voice over IP and Voice over PCM Digital Wireline Telephones characterizes: \\"When a 0.775 volt rms analog signal is applied to the coder input, a 0 dBm0 digital code is present at the digital reference. In general, when a 0 dBm0 digital code is applied to the decoder, a 0.775 volt rms analog signal appears at the decoder output. More specifically, when the 0 dBm0 periodic sequence as given in Table 2, in either mu-law or A-law as appropriate, is applied to the decoder at the digital reference point, a 1 kHz, 0.775 volt rms sine-wave signal appears at the decoder output. 0 dBm0 is 3.14 (A-law) or 3.17 (mu-law) dB below digital full scale.\\" A more commonly used unit for digital signal levels is dB Full Scale or dBFS. The relationship between dBm0 and dBFS is unfortunately ambiguous. It depends how you define rms and peak levels in a sampled system. The level of 0 dBm0 is defined as specific pattern in a sampled system (see standards referenced below). However, In an A-law coded system, the maximum level of a sinusoidal in such a system is +3.14 dBm0. The ambiguity is if the level is a peak or rms value. Today, the interpretation by many companies tend to go towards the rms interpretation. This means that +3.14 dBm0 = 0dBFS peak and -3dBFS rms. This also means that the same signal has a peak level of +6.14dBm0 peak. This means that the commonly used Point of Interconnect level of -16dBm0 can be transformed to -22.14dBFS rms in a A-law codec system. (-22.17 dBFSrms in a Œº-law codec system).

Castro was born to Spanish parents on May 4, 1885, in Cantagalo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 1890 his parents returned with him to Spain. In 1904 he graduated from the University of Granada, going on to study at the Sorbonne in Paris from 1905 to 1907. After returning to Spain he organized the Center for Historical Studies in Madrid in 1910 and headed its department of lexicography. In 1915 he became a professor at the University of Madrid. Later, when the Spanish Republic was declared, Castro became its first ambassador to Germany in 1931. But when the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936 he moved to the United States, teaching literature at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison from 1937 to 1939, at the University of Texas from 1939 to 1940, and at Princeton University from 1940 to 1953. Among Castro's most notable scholarly works are The Life of Lope de Vega (1919); Language, Teaching, and Literature (1924); The Thought of Cervantes (1925); Ibero- America, Its Present and Its Past (1941); The Spaniards: an Introduction to their History (1948); The Structure of Spanish History (1954); and Out of the State of Conflict (1961).

Early years  He was born in the small village of Pandori, Jalandhar, now located in Punjab, India. He was the son of Malik Ghulam Nabi, a Headmaster at a local school. Despite the unavailability of schools in his village, his father made an effort to send him to a school miles away, where he and his friends had to walk for hours every day. After graduating from college, he enlisted as a sepoy in the British Indian Army. His personal qualities and education were soon noticed and he was sent to the Indian Military Academy, Dehra Dun for officer training and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant on the Special List on 1 June 1941.October 1942 Secret Edition Indian Army List He was admitted to the Indian Army and posted to the 16th Punjab Regiment, specifically the newly raised 7th battalion.October 1942 Secret Edition Indian Army List He was promoted war substantive Lieutenant.

Personality Major General Akhtar Hussain Mailk was known for his towering presence, unsullied boldness in strategy, quick thinking, and his love for his country. Although he was highly admired and respected by his subordinates, he was very outspoken. As a brilliant tactician he planned Operation Gibraltar and Operation Grand Slam under the auspices of Field Marshal Ayub Khan.Pakistan's Drift into Extremism: Allah, the Army, America's War on Terror By Hassan Abbas p. 44  1965 war  As GOC 12th Division, he was the overall commander for Operation Grand Slam in the Indo-Pakistan war of 1965. For his successful handling of the initial phase of the operation, he was awarded the Hilal-i-Jurat, the second highest gallantry award of the Pakistan Army. Controversially, the command was handed over to General Yahya Khan in mid operation, resulting in delay and eventual failure of the operation. The cause for this midway switch over is an object of speculation to this day. It is alleged that Field Marshal Ayub Khan knew that if General Akhtar Malik managed to capture Kashmir, he would become a hero for the public of Pakistan. General Yahya was thus introduced midway by Ayub Khan to foil any chances of rise of General Akhtar Malik as a hero who could become his political rival in future. In a letter to his brother General Abdul Ali Malik, General Akhtar Malik highlighted sudden change of command and inept leadership of General Yahya as one of the main causes of failure. Legacy Qudrat Ullah Shahab an eminent Urdu writer and civil servant from Pakistan said that Zulfikar Ali Bhutto the ninth Prime Minister of Pakistan and its fourth President said Death Malik was posted to CENTO in Ankara, Turkey where he died in a road accident. His body was brought back to Pakistan and being an Ahmadi, he was buried in Rabwah.

The lake was created by Bristol Water (Bristol Waterworks Company as it was known then), when it dammed the River Yeo, starting construction in 1898, to designs by Charles Hawksley, and completing this in 1905. The Wrington Vale Light Railway was constructed primarily to bring building materials for the lake. The reservoir was formed by the construction of a dam and provided water to the pumping station which originally contained four Woolf compound rotative beam pumping engines, built by Glenfield & Kennedy of Kilmarnock, which have now been replaced by electric pumps. Two of the steam engines have been preserved, with one in working order as part of the visitor centre which also includes educational facilities for children. The pumping station is now a Grade II* listed building. The lake still provides of drinking water each year, but also acts as a fishing lake. It provides a habitat for a range of flora and fauna and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The original suction tanks, which formed the water supply for the steam boilers powering the pumping engines, are now used for trout rearing. Reservoir The lake, which was originally called the Yeo reservoir, covers . The River Yeo rises in the centre of Compton Martin village, from there it flows past the village of Ubley and enters Blagdon Lake. From the lake the river flows south of Wrington and Iwood, where there were once a series of watermills along its banks. Its route then takes it around the northern outskirts of Congresbury, and across the North Somerset Levels roughly parallel to the A370 road, past the site of a Roman villa before crossing under the M5 motorway and emptying into the Severn Estuary in Woodspring Bay, downstream from Clevedon and west of the village of Kingston Seymour. The watershed catchment area of the reservoir is . Aerial photograph showing Blagdon Lake in the foreground and Chew Valley Lake in the distance. The construction of the reservoir was approved by acts of parliament in 1888 and 1889 as part of a plan to provide drinking water to Bristol, supplementing Barrow Gurney Reservoirs and the \\"line of works\\" pipe which carries water from the Mendip Hills. Construction required the provision of sewers to local villages to avoid contamination of the reservoir. The work was designed by Charles Hawksley. In conjunction with the construction work the Wrington Vale Light Railway was established connecting Blagdon with Congresbury on the Cheddar Valley Line and Yatton on the main Bristol to Exeter line. In addition to carrying construction materials for the reservoir and pumping station it also provided passenger services. Later the railway was used to bring coal for the pumps. Passenger traffic ceased in 1931 and the line to Blagdon closed completely in 1950. The lake is relatively shallow, with an average depth of and only at its deepest point near the dam at the west end of the lake. The eastern end is the shallowest where the River Yeo enters. It is a hard water area with high mineral content that is vulnerable to eutrophication in the summer, that can cause algal blooms, with transient water layers. As a result, a research programme has been established to observe and measure the limnology of the lake. When full it contains and supplies of water each year. Water can also be taken from its larger neighbour Chew Valley Lake to balance the supply. Dam The dam extends below ground to the solid rock underlying the valley. It was built of puddled clay with a central concrete core and faced with granite on the lake side. A diameter pipe through the dam leads to the pumping station while a larger one is used to remove silt collecting against the dam. A flow of water is maintained in the River Yeo through a compensation channel and an overflow weir and spillway take flood water downstream. Pumping station and Visitor Centre Blagdon pumping station Blagdon Pumping Station and Visitor Centre includes science and environment exhibits and hands-on displays as well as a room dedicated to the charity WaterAid. One of the two steam-driven beam engines is still working occasionally. Outside this is space for picnics and a nature trail. When the lake first opened there were four Woolf compound rotative beam pumping engines, housed in two separate buildings. They were built by Glenfield & Kennedy of Kilmarnock between 1900 and 1905. The engine's beam is long and weighs 17 tons. The flywheel is in diameter and weighs 20 tons, having a crank throw of . Each beam engine had an output of at 17 rpm. The high-pressure cylinders, in diameter and with a stroke, were supplied by steam from horizontal Lancashire-type twin flue boilers with Green's economisers at . The low-pressure cylinder was in diameter and has a stroke. Three engines with a fourth on standby could pump water at a rate of per day, whilst the boilers consumed 8.5 tons of coal per day. A mechanical efficiency of 90% was claimed, the diameter pump bucket, strike and plunger diameter of gave a pump output of per stroke. They ran until 1949, when two engines from the north engine house were replaced by electric pumps. In 1950 automatic shutdown equipment was installed to prevent damage in the event of a burst main or overloading of the new electric pumps. This meant that it was no longer essential to have staff on site 24 hours a day. The decorative chimney was shortened in the 1960s. In 2014 new split-case vertical pumps and various other new equipment was installed to replace those installed in the 1940s and 1950s. The flywheel In 1984 it was decided to preserve the two remaining engines and incorporate them as the central feature in the Visitor Centre, including a Museum in the old boiler house, which opened in 1988 and attracts over 30,000 visitors a year. The flywheel is now driven by an electric motor. The pumping station is now a Grade II* listed building, while the gothic-style meter house is Grade II listed and used as a bat sanctuary. Fishing Nymph fly patterns innovated by Dr Bell of Wrington for use at Blagdon Angler's Map of Blagdon Lake Blagdon Lake first opened as a trout fishery in 1904. The lake is well known for trout fishing from its banks and the fleet of 18 rowing boats for hire. The suction tanks which originally supplied water to the steam boilers for the pumping engines are now used as rearing pools for the fish before they are transferred into the lake. On average 50,000 trout are reared at Blagdon each year by Bristol Water to stock this and surrounding lakes such as Chew Valley Lake and the Barrow Tanks. Ecology The lakeside with trees Blagdon Lake is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) of , created in 1971, largely because of the variety of species and habitats. The area around the pumping station was laid out as an ornamental woodland which includes Scots pine, Cedar, Larch, Spruce, Oak, Beech, Chestnut, Willow, Lime, Holly and Maple. A variety of orchids including green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio) and southern marsh-orchids can be seen on the borders of the lake. A variety of water birds can be seen around the lake including: great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus) and little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), cormorant (Phalacrocoracidae), mute swan (Cygnus olor), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), duck (Anatidae), shoveller (Anas clypeata) and gadwall (Anas strepera). The common buzzard (Buteo buteo) can be seen on the surrounding hills and both Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and kestrel breed. Occasional visitors include: osprey (\\"Pandion haeliatis\\"), goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo), nuthatch and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). The ruddy darter dragonfly (Sympetrum sanguineum) can also be seen. In the wood at the western end of the lake there are populations of badgers, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and foxes.

He has represented New Zealand at full international level. Biography Webster's family moved to Australia when he was a toddler and he was brought up there. Injuries have been a source of problems for Webster. In 1995, while on trial at Newcastle United, he broke his ankle and was forced to return to Australia, where he finished school and played junior football for MacArthur Rams and Blacktown City. He returned to England in 1996 and joined Charlton Athletic as a trainee. He turned professional in August 1998, but failed to make the first team squad and was released. He was briefly with Faversham Town before joining Colchester United in May 1999. However, with Colchester in the midst of a financial crisis, he was released before he had made his debut. He then played for Ashford Town (Kent) and Welling United. He joined Torquay United on trial in February 2002, but was not offered a contract. He joined Margate in August 2002, but played just once, as a late substitute for John Keister as Margate drew 1‚Äì1 at home to Morecambe in the Conference on 17 August. He joined Maidstone United later the same month. He returned to Australia in 2003 to play for St George Saints where in the last match of the season he snapped a medial ligaments in his knee. However, David Hodgson, Darlington's manager, saw potential in Webster and decided to give him an opportunity to regain fitness at his club which eventually led to Webster signing for Darlington in October 2004. He made his league debut on 6 November, as a late substitute for Craig Hignett who had scored both goals as Darlington won 2‚Äì1 away to Rushden & Diamonds. Webster was released by Darlington in May 2006 and returned to Australia. He was signed by A-League club Perth Glory where he played every game in a failed campaign to make the final series. After a game against Adelaide United on 28 December 2006, Webster came to blows with teammate and Glory captain Jamie Harnwell, while the players were still on the pitch.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aySt8lArSOg It went down in history as an A-League classic moment. After leaving Perth Glory, he had a brief spell with Blacktown City Demons before returning to England to work as a personal trainer in Teesside, close to his pregnant girlfriend's home. He had trials with Brighton & Hove Albion and Burton Albion (scoring for the Brewers against Nottingham Forest in the Bass Charity Vase Final) in England and also with a side in Bratislava before joining Workington. He moved to Conference North rivals Blyth Spartans at the start of October 2007, but left in April 2008 to join Finnish side Myllykosken Pallo -47. He played 10 games with MyPa before joining another Finnish club, Kuopion Palloseura. Webster played 8 games for KuPS and helped the team to keep their place in Veikkausliiga. In January 2009 Webster re-joined Blyth Spartans. In January 2010 he signed for Australian side Cockburn City. International career Webster made his international debut for New Zealand in a 0‚Äì1 loss to Australia in London on 9 June 2005. In 2006, he returned to New Zealand for the first time since his childhood, for the two match series against Malaysia. In 2006, he overcome ankle injury to gain selection for the All Whites in their off season tour which included footballing giants Brazil. He has made a total of five official international appearances for New Zealand.

He accumulated more than 500 football league appearances and scored almost 150 goals in a 14-year professional career. He also earned ten international caps for Scotland. Playing career=Early career Born in Glenrothes, Scotland but raised in Yorkshire, Speedie worked as a coalminer, playing for Brodsworth Welfare, before signing professional terms with Barnsley in 1978. Without having scored a single goal for Barnsley in 21 appearances, he moved to Darlington in 1980, where his talent first became apparent. Just two years later, he was spotted by then-Chelsea manager John Neal, who signed him for ¬£80,000 in May 1982. Chelsea Speedie had a five-year stint at Chelsea where he formed a prolific strike partnership with Kerry Dixon. Speedie's strength, scoring prowess, work-rate and unlikely heading ability (he is 5 ft 7 in tall) perfectly complemented both Dixon and winger Pat Nevin as the trio notched up almost 200 goals between them in three years. Before the arrival of Nevin and Dixon, however, Speedie had played an important part in Chelsea's survival in the Second Division a year earlier, with his seven goals (including two on his debut against Oldham Athletic) that season proving crucial. Speedie was the Chelsea Player of the Year 1985 and popular with the fans for his consistent gutsy performances. In 1986, he became the first senior player since Geoff Hurst in the 1966 World Cup final to score a hat- trick at Wembley, as Chelsea defeated Manchester City 5‚Äì4 in the Full Members Cup final, after Chelsea had led 5-1. That year Chelsea finished sixth in the league, having been in the hunt for the league title for most of the season before a late slump in form ruled them out of contention in the final weeks. Coventry City Having scored 64 goals in 205 appearances for the West London side, Speedie joined Coventry City for ¬£750,000 in July 1987 following a disagreement with Chelsea manager John Hollins. His first appearance was in the 1987 Charity Shield against Everton where he narrowly missed out on scoring on his debut. This statistic would be rectified just a week later however when in an effective replay of the 1987 Cup Final at Highfield Road Speedie scored with a fine low shot past Clemence to set up a 2‚Äì1 win over Spurs. Whilst Coventry were hampered in their post Cup final season by a disintegrating pitch, Speedie earned the notable distinction of scoring a hat- trick whilst finishing on the losing side in a 3‚Äì4 defeat against Middlesbrough. Speedie combined with the aerial strength of Cyrille Regis and the wide options of David Smith, David Phillips, Micky Gynn and Brian Borrows to score some memorable goals. His chipped winning goal at Carrow Road a week after a Cup defeat to non-league Sutton United, against a high-flying Norwich City side, was almost universally described in the press as 'sublime'.Coventry Evening Telegraph (16 January 1989). This became the Speedie trademark at Coventry and was used to great effect against the likes of Wimbledon and Southampton. He was a key component in the Coventry City side in the 1988/89 campaign, beating the champions-elect Arsenal and riding as high as 3rd in the league as late as February. They would only lose 5 games on their travels that season-winning the same number away from home.Jim Brown (2000) Coventry City:An Illustrated History. Their 7th-place finish was only the third time a top 8 place had been achieved. The latter half of his spell at Coventry would see him drop back into a deeper midfield role which led to a significant reduction in his goals tally. He enjoyed just under four years at Coventry, none of which were relegation battles, scoring 35 goals (Cup and league). This equalled his Chelsea strike rate and enabled him to maintain a presence in the Scottish international side. His indiscipline and habit of courting controversy was always a major weakness. Speedie left Highfield Road amid the turbulent and transitional autumn/winter period of 1990/91, which would see manager John Sillett replaced by Terry Butcher. Later career Speedie joined Liverpool in January 1991 and became Kenny Dalglish's last signing before his resignation on 22 February 1991.Past Players - David Speedie Liverpoolfc.tv Dalglish had been interested in signing Speedie four years earlier when he was still at Chelsea. He scored on his Liverpool debut at Old Trafford then scored twice in the Merseyside Derby in the next league game, and by the end of the season had scored six goals for the Reds - all in the league. However, his Liverpool career was short and when Graeme Souness took over as manager he was sold that summer to Blackburn Rovers, where Dalglish returned to management soon afterwards. On the final day of the 1991-92 season, he scored a hat-trick in a win which relegated Plymouth Argyle but most significantly fired Rovers into the play-offs and would be a major step towards a new era for the club, beginning with a playoff final victory which took them into the new FA Premier League, which they won three years later. Speedie was not to be part of Blackburn's Premier League adventures. He was sold to Southampton for ¬£400,000, replacing Alan Shearer who had moved the other way for ¬£3.6million, a national record fee. Speedie joined the Saints at the same time as his old Chelsea strike partner Kerry Dixon. He made just seven appearances (scoring twice) for the Saints in the 1992‚Äì93 league campaign, making his Premier League debut, having unsuccessful loan spells with Birmingham City and West Bromwich Albion before another loan deal in early March took him to Division One promotion contenders West Ham United. His four goals in 11 league games helped the Hammers secure automatic promotion to the Premier League as Division One runners-up. Speedie was not offered a permanent contract with West Ham. Instead, he accepted on offer from Brian Little to sign for Division One promotion hopefuls Leicester City. He scored 12 goals in 37 league games for the East Midlands side in 1993‚Äì94 as they qualified for the playoffs and sealed promotion to the Premier League by defeating local rivals Derby County 2-1 in the playoff final at Wembley Stadium. Speedie missed that game through suspension and retired later in the year due to injury, having never featured in the Premier League for the Foxes. International Speedie made his senior debut for Scotland on 25 May 1985 in a 1‚Äì0 Rous Cup tie win over England. He won the last of his 10 full caps for Scotland on 30 May 1989 against Chile, also a Rous Cup tie, which Scotland won 2‚Äì0. However, Speedie never scored for the Scottish national side. Later life He continued his career at non-league level for a host of clubs including Stamford AFC and Hendon where he made 5 appearances whilst failing to score. Indeed, his most impressive 45 minutes came as a replacement goalkeeper for the second half of Hendon's first game of the 1996‚Äì97 season against Sutton United after first choice Scott Ashcroft got injured just before half time. He also made a handful of Northern League appearances for Crook Town. He retired having scored 150 career goals. Speedie lived for a while in Dublin where he commented for Setanta Sports and played for Francis AFC in Dublin's United Churches League. Speedie allegedly made racist remarks at a charity event in 2004.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/speedie-talk- gives-rise-to-charges-of-racist-gibes-xnzrjwpvxfh In 2020, Chelsea FC removed Speedie's name from the only two named entrances of Stamford Bridge stadium, put up by former club chairman Ken Bates in the 1980s.https://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/2020/10/13/21513543/why-did- chelsea-remove-the-names-of-david-speedie-and-nigel-spackman-from-the-stadium  Honours  Chelsea * Second Division: 1983‚Äì84 * Full Members Cup: 1985‚Äì86 Coventry * FA Charity Shield: runners‚Äìup 1987 Blackburn Rovers * Second Division play‚Äìoffs: 1992 Leicester City * First Division play‚Äìoffs: 1994 Stamford * United Counties League: 1997‚Äì98 * Benevolent Cup: 1997‚Äì98 * Lincolnshire Senior 'A' Cup: 1997‚Äì98 * Hinchingbrooke Cup: 1997‚Äì98 ReferencesExternal links *LFC History Profile *Scotland stats Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scotland international footballers Category:Barnsley F.C. players Category:Birmingham City F.C. players Category:Blackburn Rovers F.C. players Category:Chelsea F.C. players Category:Coventry City F.C. players Category:Darlington F.C. players Category:Leicester City F.C. players Category:Liverpool F.C. players Category:Southampton F.C. players Category:West Ham United F.C. players Category:Hendon F.C. players Category:People from Glenrothes Category:Brodsworth Welfare A.F.C. players Category:Sportspeople from Fife Category:Scotland under-21 international footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:English Football League players Category:Premier League players Category:Outfield association footballers who played in goal Category:Anglo-Scots ","title":"David Speedie"},{"id":"3811887","text":"Gary Porter is an American former monster-truck driver that races on the United States Hot Rod Association circuit. He is a former member of the Grave Digger team but returned to his Carolina Crusher truck in 2015. In July 2017, Gary Porter retired from monster truck driving after spending 32 years in the sport. History Porter's involvement in monster truck began in 1981 when he opened Porter's 4x4 Shop in Wadesboro, North Carolina, with his brother. In 1985, they built their first truck to promote the business and compete in local shows. Soon afterward, they modified the truck, and Porter began his monster-truck racing career. In 1987, he started competing in a monster truck called the Carolina Crusher with TNT Motosports.. monstertruckracing.com. The Porters participated in exhibitions from 1985 to 1988. He placed fourth in 1988, second in 1989, and third in 1990. Beginning in 1991, Porter raced in the USHRA/Camel Mud & Monster Series. The Carolina Crusher placed sixth and became the series champion of the Special Events season. In 1992, the Porters decided to build a second truck to be able to compete in three different monster truck series. A third Carolina Crusher appeared for the 1994 season, as did a new shop to host Carolina Crusher Racing. The trucks made 125 appearances in 1994. 1995 saw Carolina Crusher finish fourth in the Special Events Penda Points series and winning a race. Gary continued to race Carolina Crusher until after its sale to Paul Shafer in 1999. In 2000, Clear Channel Entertainment hired Porter to drive various trucks for them, notably Ragin' Steel and Spider-Man. The following year, at the behest of longtime friend and rival Dennis Anderson, he began driving Grave Digger 12, whose chassis was similar to that of his last incarnation of Carolina Crusher.  World Finals appearances  Porter was in Monster Jam World Finals 2 driving Spider-Man. He was eliminated in the first round by Avenger, but returned when Avenger broke down. He was eliminated in the second round by Destroyer. He later finished seventh in freestyle with a score of 31. In World Finals 9, he was involved in an encore driving the new Spitfire truck. Hallmarks Porter tends to have a tremendous amount of respect for his equipment and is typically considered to be the tamest in freestyle of all the Digger drivers. At the same time, his truck-control abilities are exceptional, and he has been a USHRA-points champion many times. Off the track, Porter is regarded as one of the sport's true gentlemen. The 1992 USHRA Yearbook referred to him as \\"Mr. Nice Guy\\".

His first book, A Thief in the Night came out in 1918, possibly self-published. His last, An Account of Capers was published posthumously in 1988, a span of 70 years. Life and work Marshall was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, the son of Claude Niven Marshall and Annie Margaret (Bruce) Marshall. He was educated at St. Andrews. He became a Roman Catholic in 1917 and remained active and interested in the faith for the rest of his life. He was a member and at times served as an officer in the Una Voce and the Latin Mass Society organisations. During World War I he initially served as a private in the Highland Light Infantry. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Royal Irish Fusiliers in 1918 and was then moved to The 34th County of London Battalion. Six days before the 1918 Armistice he was seriously wounded at Bruyelles in France. Courageous German medical orderlies risked intense shelling to rescue him and he was taken prisoner.Marshall, B: The World, the Flesh, and Father Smith endnote. Houghton Mifflin 1945. His injuries resulted in the amputation of one leg. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1919 and invalided out in 1920. After the war he completed his education in Scotland, graduating with a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Edinburgh in 1925 before becoming an auditor, and moved to France where he worked in the Paris branch of Peat Marwick Mitchell. In 1928 he married Mary Pearson Clark (1908‚Äì1987). They had one daughter‚ÄîSheila Elizabeth Bruce Marshall. In 2009, his granddaughter, Leslie Ferrar, was Treasurer to the Prince of Wales. He was living in Paris during the 1940 Invasion of France and escaped two days before the Nazi occupied the city. Returning to England he rejoined the military, initially serving in the Royal Army Pay Corps as a lieutenant. He was promoted to captain in Intelligence, assisting the French underground, and then was a lieutenant- colonel in the Displaced Persons Division in Austria.Marshall, B: The Accounting endnote Houghton Mifflin Company 1958. He transferred to the General List in 1945, and left the Army as a lieutenant-colonel in 1946. After the war Marshall returned to France, moving to the C√¥te d'Azur and living there for the remainder of his life. He died in Biot, France, six days before his 88th birthday. Writing career A Roman Catholic convert, Marshall wrote stories that are usually humorous and mildly satiric and typically have religious overtones. Important themes which run through his works are Catholicism, accounting, a Scottish heritage and war, adventure and intrigue. Often major characters are accountants or Catholic priests. Characters in his novels are often fond of animals and concerned about their treatment. Contempt for modern art and literature is often expressed. Marshall's first literary work was a collection of short stories entitled A Thief in the Night published while he was still a student at St. Andrews University.Marshall, B: A Thread of Scarlet endnote. Collins 1959. His first novel, This Sorry Scheme was published in 1924. A stream of novels soon followed, but none of the fiction he wrote before the Second World War gained as much notoriety or staying power as Father Malachy's Miracle (1931). After the Second World War Marshall became a writer full-time, giving up his work as an accountant. As to his dual career as an accountant and writer, Marshall once said, \\"I am an accountant who writes books. In accounting circles I am hailed as a great writer. Among novelists I am assumed to be a competent accountant.\\"Marshall, B: To Every Man a Penny endnote. Houghton Mifflin 1949. Among his better known works after the Second World War is The White Rabbit (1953), a biography of Wing Commander F. F. E. Yeo-Thomas, describing his exploits and sufferings while in the Resistance during World War II. In 1959 he was awarded the W≈Çodzimierz Pietrzak prize. The theme of much of Marshall's works is religion, with a focus on Roman Catholicism. His first great success, Father Malachy's Miracle, is about an innocent Scottish priest whose encounter with sinful behaviour causes him to become involved in a miracle. A number of his later novels also deal with clergy who are faced with temptation but manage to triumph in a modest and humble manner (e.g., The World, the Flesh, and Father Smith (AKA All Glorious Within) (1944), A Thread of Scarlet (AKA Satan and Cardinal Campbell) (1959), Father Hilary's Holiday (1965), The Month of the Falling Leaves (1963)). Other books centered on religious issues deal more with Catholic doctrine and its relationship to modern life than with personal responsibility, such as The Bishop (1970), Peter the Second (1976), Urban the Ninth (1973) and Marx the First (1975). Like many expatriates, Marshall expressed great love for his homeland. Most of his books were either set in Great Britain and/or have main characters of British nationality. The work which best shows Marshall's affection for Scotland may be The Black Oxen (1972), which Marshall billed as a Scottish Epic. Several of Marshall's books have themes about espionage and intrigue, such as Luckypenny (1937), A Girl from L√ºbeck (1962), The Month of the Falling Leaves (1963), Operation Iscariot (1974), An Account of Capers (1988), The Accounting (AKA The Bank Audit) (1958), and Only Fade Away (1954). Some of his novels feature major characters who, like Marshall himself, have suffered the loss of a limb. Often major characters from one novel appear in minor roles in other novels. Marshall was relatively popular in his time. His books were reviewed in major publications on both sides of the Atlantic. At least two of his books were Book of the Month Club selections; Vespers in Vienna (1947) and The World, the Flesh, and Father Smith (AKA All Glorious Within) (1944), in June 1945. An Armed Services Edition of The World, the Flesh, and Father Smith was also produced. His books were published in at least nine languages ‚Äì English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Polish, Czech, Portuguese & Spanish. Film, stage and television adaptations His 1931 novel Father Malachy's Miracle was adapted for the stage in 1938 by Brian Doherty. Father Malachy's Miracle play review The novel was adapted for presentation on The Ford Theatre Hour, an American TV show, in 1950. In 1961, the novel was the basis for the German film Das Wunder des Malachias directed by Bernhard Wicki and starring Horst Bollmann, Richard M√ºnch and Christiane Nielsen. His 1947 novel Vespers in Vienna was the basis of the 1949 film The Red Danube starring Walter Pidgeon, Ethel Barrymore, Peter Lawford, Angela Lansbury and Janet Leigh. George Sidney directed. After the movie's release the novel was re-issued under the title The Red Danube. His 1953 novel The Fair Bride was the basis of the 1960 film The Angel Wore Red starring Ava Gardner, Dirk Bogarde, Joseph Cotten and Vittorio De Sica. It was the last film directed by Nunnally Johnson. His 1952 book, The White Rabbit, recounting the World War II exploits of secret agent F. F. E. Yeo- Thomas, was made into a TV mini-series in 1967. His 1963 novel The Month of the Falling Leaves was the basis of the 1968 German TV show Der Monat der fallenden Bl√§tter. Marshall co-wrote the screenplay with . It was directed by Dietrich Haugk.

While \\"Skycam\\" is a registered trademarkhttp://www.uspto.gov/ the term \\"Skycam\\" is often used generically for cable-suspended camera system, and competing systems like CableCam (invented by Jim Rodnunsky but also a subsidiary of Kroenke Sports & Entertainment, LLC), Spidercam and Robycam 3D. Systems like it have been in limited use since the mid-1980s when the technology was first patented, but until the mid-1990s progress was slow due to limitations in computer and servo motor technology as well as cost (a 2001 estimate pegged the cost to use the Skycam at $30,000 per event). All of these systems began seeing more widespread use in the 21st century. American football Skycam was first publicly used in fall 1984, at a preseason National Football League game in San Diego between the Chargers and 49ers, televised by CBS. NBC debuted the first wire-flown remote-controlled camera used in sports coverage at the 1985 Orange Bowl. The XFL was one of the first leagues to make extensive use of the Skycam as a primary camera angle for broadcasts when it debuted in winter 2001. Traditional camera angles were used more prominently after the first week of play; the \\"Xcam\\" (as it was known in that league's broadcasts) remained in regular use throughout the rest of the season. ESPN first used Skycam in 2001 for an NFL pre-season telecast and then consistently in 2002 for Sunday Night Football broadcasts. Since then, ESPN and sister-network ABC have made widespread use of Skycam for NCAA football, Monday Night Football, and Super Bowl XXXVII respectively. The network has regularly offered a skycam-only Internet broadcast of many of its more important sportscasts under the Megacast brand. CBC used a CableCam in their broadcasts of the 2005 and 2006 Grey Cups. In October 2017, NBC was required to broadcast the majority of a Sunday Night Football game using Skycam angles, as their traditional sideline angles were obscured by a large amount of fog. Reception to the impromptu experiment was mostly positive (with some drawing comparisons to the default camera angle used in football video games, such as the Madden NFL franchise); NBC announced that it would experiment with intentionally using the Skycam as a primary angle during a subsequent Thursday-night game on November 16, 2017 and again for the December 14 game the same year. ' The Skycam's perspective, while making more effective use of the field of vision offered by a television screen (thus allowing viewers to see plays develop more clearly than the traditional sideline view),3 plays that show perfectly why Skycam is the future of the NFL on TV distorts vertical distances and makes it more difficult to assess yardages (part of the reason it has not been used more often), and thus in NBC's trial runs, they switched to a traditional sideline camera in short-yardage situations including the red zone, where the shorter distances negate some of the disadvantages of the sideline camera. To mitigate some of these disadvantages, NBC experimented with expanding the live on-field graphics to include a \\"green zone\\" that darkens the area between the line of scrimmage and the line to gain for a first down. Other sports Prior to the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, it was proposed that Skycam be used at the Opening Ceremonies and Track & Field events. A test run was held at the Coliseum. The images were terrific. However, during its last test, it sped very fast low to the ground and the entire length of the field. One of its four support wires snagged on the top of the steel football goal post at the Peristyle end of the Coliseum and bent one of the arms. Skycam was unharmed, but was not used at the Olympics that year. Systems from Skycam and CableCam have also been used for the NBA and NHL final series and the beginning of the 2005 and 2006 NASCAR season broadcast on Fox. CableCam was used on the famous 17th hole at the TPC at Sawgrass for NBC's coverage of The Players Championship in 2005. CBS used a SkyCam for their coverage of the 2010 NCAA Men's Basketball Final Four games in Lucas Oil Stadium. In Australia, the Nine Network trialed Skycam for three of their Friday Night Football broadcasts of the Australian Football League for the 2004 season. It was also used in the State of Origin series. The first use of Skycam for an MLS broadcast was on April 2, 2005 for an ESPN broadcast of a match between DC United and Chivas USA at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California. However, the use of Skycam soon proved to be controversial a few weeks later on April 23, 2005 when the camera crashed to the field of the Home Depot Center during a match between the LA Galaxy and Chivas USA. Skycam has been used infrequently for MLS broadcasts since then, including the 2015 MLS All-Star Game. On April 2, 2016, Sporting Kansas City debuted the league's first semi-permanent Skycam installation at Children's Mercy Park, in a match against Real Salt Lake. Technical overview Skycam consists of three major components: the reel‚Äîthe motor drive and cables, the spar‚Äîthe counterbalanced pan and tilt video camera, and central control‚Äîthe computer software used by the operator to fly the camera. Reels The system consists of four reels anchored at high fixed points at corners of the stadium or arena (the cables are attached to fixed spars formed by tall extensible lift platforms when permanent anchors are not available). Each reel is a cable spool with motor and disc brakes with its own computer capable of a .01\\" positioning resolution. The cable is a braided Kevlar jacketed single mode optical fiber with conductive copper elements and is capable of supporting on a single cable. Mobile spar The tall spar contains the Sony HD camera, the pan and tilt motor, and stabilization sensors. Weighing , the package also includes a power distribution module and electronics for fiber optic signaling. Central control Central control is an industrial grade, Linux computer workstation that provides camera flight and video control. Both a pilot (the one who flies the spar in 3D space) and the operator (the one who controls the camera pan, tilt, zoom and focus) use this system for controlling the overall video shot. The central computer system uses a custom software package to control each aspect of the camera system, including motion, video, and obstacle avoidance. Incidents * In the December 20, 2009 Las Vegas Bowl between the Oregon State Beavers and the BYU Cougars, Skycam had to be taken down as a result of high winds. Gusts were reported at over 40 miles per hour. * In the 2011 Insight Bowl on December 30, 2011 between the Iowa Hawkeyes and the Oklahoma Sooners, Skycam crashed onto the field with 2:22 left to play, almost striking Iowa receiver Marvin McNutt.

Founded in 1884, the academy closed in 1976. The school was highly regarded for its academic and military programs, and many notable American political and military leaders are graduates, including 1964 presidential candidate Sen. Barry Goldwater, 1960's folk singer Phil Ochs, and John Dean, a White House Counsel who was a central figure in the Watergate scandal of the early 1970s. A museum dedicated to the school's history is located on its former campus, now part of Mary Baldwin University. Throughout its history, the academy was referred to by students, faculty, and Staunton residents simply by its initials, SMA. History Plaque at Kable Hall honoring Staunton Military Academy's founding family Staunton Male Academy was founded in 1884 by William H. Kable, a native of Virginia in the region that became West Virginia following the Civil War. Kable served the Confederacy during the war and was injured during the Battle of Gettysburg, and when the war ended began a career in education. After teaching briefly in rural Virginia, Kable enrolled at the University of Virginia to resume studies he had begun before the war. He graduated with a Master of Arts in 1868 and briefly started a school outside Staunton, Virginia but left teaching to tend to his family's farm near Charlestown, West Virginia. Kable married during this period and had his first son in 1872. Around this time, he joined the Charlestown Academy, a private school, as Principal, a position he held for 12 years. Near the end of his tenure at Charlestown, in May 1884, Kable sold 13 acres of his farm and purchased a house and four-acre property in Staunton with the intention of starting his own school. Troubled times On September 2, 1884, the Staunton Male Academy opened with 50 students, including boarders who lived in the Kable residence. Classes were held in a frame building Kable had constructed on the property. After four years of successful operation, Kable added a wood frame barracks, acquired additional land, and adopted a military format, changing the school's name to Staunton Military Academy. During the summer of 1888, Kable's brother-in-law and business manager W.W. Gibbs went on a tour of the South and recruited more than 40 students. The academy started its 1888-89 session with a total enrollment of 117 cadets and a faculty of 11 instructors. Around this time, a depression struck the country, and over the next decade enrollment at the new academy dwindled, falling to 50 in 1892. Unable to satisfy his creditors, Kable turned over control of the school to a trustee, and the next year he was forced to sell his assets at public auction, first the school's furnishings and equipment and then his land, house, and school buildings. Kable incorporated Staunton Military Academy which offered to buy the school's contents and was high bidder for the properties, having secured bonds that were to be satisfied in annual payments. Kable spent the next ten years paying off his remaining debts, which were finally settled in 1903. However, during this period enrollment continued to decline, sinking to 30 in 1896 and a low of 15 in 1900. Recovery years Kable's son William G. Kable was completing his studies at the academy as the troubles were just beginning. After graduating with honors in 1890, he went off to work for a year in Cincinnati, completed business college in Baltimore, taught for two years at the academy, and then worked for several major firms in New York City. The younger Kable finally returned to Staunton in 1898 to become a Mathematics and Languages instructor and was promoted to Commandant in 1900 with responsibility for managing the academy's operations. He was joined by another key figure in the school's development, Thomas Russell. A graduate of The Citadel military college in South Carolina, Russell had distinguished himself as a cadet and after graduation became Commandant at Horner Military Academy in North Carolina. In 1904, he was invited to come to Staunton as Headmaster. Meanwhile, Captain Kable, as the father was known (he had been a Sergeant during the Civil War), served as President. The new Commandant began expanding the school soon after taking over. He built a three-story wooden frame Mess Hall in 1901 with cadet rooms on the upper floors and added a five-story frame barracks in 1904. Enrollment soared over the first years of the new century with 270 cadets signed up for the start of the 1904 academic session. Then, on November 25, 1904, the day after Thanksgiving, a fire broke out in the new barracks. By morning, three of the academy's main structures were leveled, including the new barracks, the school's original barracks, and its classroom building. Only the Mess Hall building and Kable residence were spared. Fortunately, no students were seriously injured, many of them awoken by Captain Kable himself. The town of Staunton responded to the tragedy admirably. Cadets were offered temporary housing, and the YMCA provided accommodations for classes. Meanwhile, the Kables went right to work rebuilding the school. Expansion period Advertisement circa 1916 In March 1905, construction began on a combination barracks and classroom facility. Within six months the building was completed, in time for the start of the 1905 school year that September. Eventually named South Barracks, the three-story brick fortress-like structure stood on the top of the hill at the southern edge of the academy grounds overlooking Mary Baldwin College. The arched entranceway at the north end led to an open quadrangle surrounded by cadet rooms, classrooms, and study hall on the first floor and open galleries with cadet rooms and suspended walkways on the two upper floors. In all, the barracks accommodated over 100 cadet rooms, 3 laboratories, and 19 classrooms, including a large instruction hall on the second floor. The academy flourished under the younger Kable over the next 15 years. Captain Kable died in 1912, at which point his son became President. That same year, the academy's plaza, which was used several times each day for cadet formations, was covered with asphalt, giving the assembly area the name it would be known by for the next six decades, \\"The Asphalt.\\" In 1913, a new 500-seat Mess Hall was completed, and a building known as the Natatorium was erected to house a new swimming pool. In 1917, while the U.S. was becoming involved in World War I on the side of the Allies, SMA joined the Army's Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) program, an affiliation that would last for nearly a half-century. The next year, a Junior School was added for 6th through 8th grades with the only wooden barracks to be built since the disastrous fire of 1904. Finally, North Barracks was constructed in 1919. With six stories and a smokestack at the rear rising another three stories above the roof, the building was the tallest ever built in Staunton. Four three-story columns graced its entrance, topped by a triangular gable with a large clock overlooking The Asphalt. The bottom floor, which was two stories tall, housed a gymnasium that could be used as a 1,600-seat assembly hall. The second floor included a mezzanine and the entrance to the school's armory, an underground storage facility in the front of the barracks. The entrance from The Asphalt led to the building's third floor, which housed the school library, a post office, cadet social room, classrooms, and a laboratory. As with South Barracks, the building had an open quadrangle with cadet rooms around the perimeter and suspended walkways on the three upper floors. With the addition of North Barracks and its 55 cadet rooms, SMA opened its 1919-20 academic year with 650 students, a record that would stand until the mid-1960s. Good times and bad Kable Hall, Staunton Military Academy dormitory, now a Mary Baldwin University residence hall William G. Kable died in 1920, and as the academy's sole shareholder, he bequeathed ownership to his widow and their children. Thomas Russell, who was promoted to President, completed Kable's expansion plans during the mid-1920s, adding a wall around the Kable Field parade grounds, a two-story Guard House at the center of the South Barracks quadrangle, and Memorial Hall on the campus's north end. The latter structure, which was three stories tall, housed the Mathematics and Foreign Language departments, classrooms, faculty apartments, a gymnasium, and three large recreation rooms. The last major building to be built on the SMA campus for the next 30-plus years was Kable Hall, in 1932. Located between Memorial Hall and North Barracks, the five- story structure included a new swimming pool on its ground floor, 54 cadet rooms on the three floors above the pool, and a rifle range on the fifth floor. The building, dedicated in honor of the academy's founder and his son, marked the end of the school's expansion, though various improvements would continue over the ensuing decades. With the nation in the throes of the Great Depression, SMA's enrollment plummeted, and only 264 cadets enrolled the year Kable Hall was completed. Russell died the next year, 1933. With a new president in place and a new member installed on the academy's Board of Trustees, one of the board's original trustees was accused of an impropriety that occurred during the course of Russell's tenure. In 1937, William G. Kable II brought a court suit alleging that William C. Rowland had issued improper commission payments to Russell over the 13-year period of his presidency. Rowland was forced to resign and ordered to pay $116,000 plus interest to the academy. Kable also charged Gilpin Willson, the new President, with breaching his fiduciary duty as a trustee in connection with an uncollected loan, resulting in a judgment of $150 plus 20% of the premiums for a life insurance policy taken out on Russell's behalf. In addition, Willson was held responsible for half of the commissions paid to Russell. Finally, with the death of the new trustee in 1940, William G. Kable's widow was able to replace most of the board, giving her and her son complete control of the institution. Cadet life For the next quarter of a century, SMA earned a national reputation for its academic standards and the quality of its Junior ROTC program. Each day began for cadets with reveille on The Asphalt followed by breakfast in the Mess Hall. Students then attended classes until mid-afternoon with a break for lunch. After school, cadets participated in drills, practiced sports, and enjoyed free time. Following dinner, the evenings held more free time, sweep detail, a study period, and at the end of the day, taps. On weekends, the routine changed. Saturdays included periodic military inspections and town leave, while Sundays featured church services and occasional parades. Other cadet activities included the academy's elite honor guard and drill team, The Howie Rifles; weekend varsity and junior varsity sports, notably varsity football; periodic dances; a military ball each spring; and alumni events twice annually. The school year would be capped with graduation ceremonies in late May, highlighted by a formal review of the corps on Kable Field led by the next year's First Captain, the highest ranking cadet. The academy's demise During the 1960s and 1970s, the unpopularity of the Vietnam War created an anti-military sentiment that eroded enrollments at military academies across the U.S. Contributing to the difficulties faced by military schools, particularly in the South, was the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Under the act, programs receiving federal funds were required to racially integrate. SMA chose not to do this, instead giving up federal funds by dropping its JROTC program and remaining segregated, for white students only. SMA hoped to attract an influx of white students who were withdrawing from the now-racially integrated public schools. The enrollments never materialized and instead, students gravitated toward non-military private schools. JROTC was reestablished in a few years and continued until 1976's closure, when during that year the Corp received an unprecedented 100% score during the Annual Federal Inspection, held every spring by Army Command, and known as \\"GI Weekend\\". The enrollment at Staunton peaked during the 1966-67 school year, reaching a historic high of 665 cadets. By 1972, enrollment fell to about 250, climbing back into the 300s the following year, then entering a final decline to under 200 by 1976. Accordingly, the academy's finances began to decline. Its last profitable school year was 1969-70, which ended with a net of $69,000 for the Kable family. The next year, 1970-71, the owners experienced a loss of $98,000, followed by a deficit of $132,000 a year later. Faced with the prospect of bankruptcy, the Kables elected to sell the academy. The new owner, Layne Loeffler, changed SMA's charter to non-profit status when he took over the school in 1973. The following year, Loeffler undertook cost- cutting measures, reducing athletic scholarships. His introduction of aggressive religious practices, peculiar staff and management changes, and reactions to accidental fires in South Barracks and Kable Hall proved too much. The deteriorating situation, combined with management problems, forced the academy to close in 1976. Mary Baldwin University, then a women's college and SMA's longtime neighbor, bought the property for $1.1 million in a bankruptcy sale. Staunton Military Academy today Today, eight of the buildings in which SMA cadets lived and learned survive as part of the Mary Baldwin campus. The SMA Mess Hall sign still hangs over the entrance to the building, now the university's Student Activities Center. The military legacy of the academy's grounds continues through the Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership (VWIL) at Mary Baldwin, the only all-women's corps of cadets in the world. In 2001, a joint SMA-VWIL museum opened in the academy's former supply room at 227 Kable Street in Staunton. Additionally, the alumni association has endowed four scholarships to keep the school's legacy alive: SMA Leadership Scholarship, Henry Scholarship Honoring SMA, Henry SMA Legacy Scholarship for VWIL cadets, and SMA-John Deal Education Scholarship for a Florida State University student. In April of each year an SMA all-class reunion is held in Staunton. Events include an \\"Old Boys\\" parade on Friday afternoon in conjunction with VWIL on the former SMA parade field and a banquet on Saturday night.

Like many electronic games in the late 1970s, it was also released by Sears under their own brand and the name Electronic Touchdown.http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Sears/Touchdown.htm Gameplay The game plays a simplified version of football with three offensive players and either six or seven computer-controlled defensive players depending on the player-selected difficulty. As implied by the game's name, the focus is on running and passing; gameplay proceeds essentially without punts or kickoffs. Kickoffs typically result in a touchback, with the following drive starting at the 20-yard line; however, according to the game's instruction manual, occasionally the game allows a kickoff to be run back.

He was a prominent educator who served as the Vice Chancellor of University of Cambridge (1961‚Äì63) and University of Ceylon (1942‚Äì55). Education Sir Ivor was educated at Queen Elizabeth's Hospital, Bristol (a boarding school), at Bristol Grammar School, and at St Catharine's College, Cambridge. Career Jennings joined the University of Leeds as a Lecturer in Law in 1925 and became a Holt Scholar of Gray's Inn and was called to the bar in 1928. The following year he joined the London School of Economics as Lecturer in Law. Jennings was sent to Ceylon by the British Government in 1942, as the Principal of the University College, Colombo with a mandate to create a university for that land, then a Crown colony. The institution, on the model of University of London, was dubbed the University of Ceylon and was first established in Colombo, the capital city, then partially transferred in 1952 to a purpose-built campus in Peradeniya. During World War II he served as the Deputy Civil Defense Commissioner.First Vice Chancellor of University of Ceylon He was knighted in 1948, made a Queen's Counsel in 1949, and awarded the KBE in 1955. In 1955, Jennings received an honorary doctorate by vote of the senate of the University of Ceylon to recognize his work in creating and building the institution. A hall of residence at the University of Peradeniya is named in his honour. In the same year (1955) he returned to Britain to take up the post of Master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He subsequently served a term as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, a position which at that time rotated among the heads of the colleges. Jennings married Helen Emily Konsalik in 1928 and had two daughters, Shirley (Jennings) Watson and Claire (Jennings) Dewing. Together with his wife and daughter Claire, he was aboard the MS Lakonia, a Greek-owned cruise ship, when it caught fire and sank north of Madeira on 22 December 1963, with the loss of 128 lives.

Life is VERY Good, which began with 350 participants in 2009, gathered in excess of 12,000 between its two events, held before and after the March, in 2013.http://www.anchornews.org/youth- columnists/ozzie_pacheco/february_8_2013.php Evangelical events Clergy and laity at the 2017 United Methodist event for the March for Life hosted by Lifewatch, Taskforce of United Methodists on Abortion and Sexuality At the 2016 March for Life rally, the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, organized a conference \\"aimed at increasing the level of engagement in the pro-life cause\\". The Taskforce of United Methodists on Abortion and Sexuality, which is a part of the National Pro-Life Religious Council, holds its annual service of worship at the United Methodist Building, and the liturgy held for the 2016 March of Life featured \\"a sermon by Dr. Thomas C.

Virtual March for Life In 2010, Americans United for Life launched an online virtual March. Those unable to attend the March for Life in person could create avatars of themselves and take part in a virtual demonstration on a Google Maps version of the National Mall.Thousands march in D.C. demonstration against abortion, William Wan, January 23, 2010 Washington Post, January 23, 2010 The first online event attracted approximately 75,000 participants. Media attention Compared to other events, the March for Life has received relatively little media attention over the years. The 2017 Women's March in Washington, D.C. was used to illustrate the lack of media coverage for the March for Life generally receives. A study by the Media Research Center, the 2017 Women's March received 129 times more coverage on major television networks ABC, CBS, and NBC during their morning and evening newscasts. The 2017 Women's March received 75 minutes of coverage between the networks while the March for Life received just 35 seconds. The 2019 Women's March similarly received 14 minutes 26 seconds of news coverage, while the March for Life the day before only received 54 seconds. The New York Times countered this argument stating, \\"There is widespread resentment in the anti-abortion movement that the media has not devoted much coverage to the March for Life in the past, perhaps because it happens every year.\\" To counter the relative lack of media coverage, one of the March for Life's supporters, the Family Research Council, organized a \\"Blogs for Life\\" conference in Washington, D.C. The main goal of the conference was to \\"bring pro-life bloggers together to talk over strategies\\" for securing more effective media coverage and advancing pro-life issues. Such strategies include securing media coverage through legislative means or by tapping into new media outlets. EWTN, a Catholic radio and television network, has covered the march extensively in past years.

He was also one of the three brothers who founded Johnson & Johnson. Early life Johnson was born in Carbondale, Pennsylvania. His father was Sylvester Johnson III, and his mother was Frances Louisa Wood. Johnson grew up with two siblings: James Wood Johnson and Edward Mead Johnson. Johnson was educated in the public schools of Carbondale and at Wyoming Seminary in Kingston, Pennsylvania.https://books.google.com/books?id=Suu9yUKdA8IC&pg;=PA675&lpg;=PA675&dq;=robert+wood+johnson+wyoming+seminary&source;=bl&ots;=vKXpWRMLEV&sig;=ACfU3U0nuv5Bz3uPv1uqwuOQPdWjZzqpMg&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwizi6rq9OHoAhW0lnIEHSKxDYoQ6AEwAHoECBMQKQ#v=onepage&q;=robert%20wood%20johnson%20wyoming%20seminary&f;=false Career In 1861, Johnson accepted an apprenticeship in Poughkeepsie, New York from his uncle James Wood to work for the apothecary of Wood & Tittmer. This was to become his training for a lifelong career. He later left Wood & Tittmer in 1864, to work in New York City for Roushton & Aspinwall. Lister While working for Rouston & Aspinwall, Johnson met George J. Seabury and they decided to leave the firm and go into business together under the name of Seabury & Johnson. Both men were interested in Joseph Lister's discovery of the implications of sterile surgery and tried to make products that would assist in the operating room. Johnson worked 12-hour days to try to invent aseptic surgical equipment. By 1878, the firm was making $10,000 a month (or in 2017 dollars $258,046.31.) Seabury and Johnson disagreed on the distribution of the firm's profits. Seabury disapproved of having Johnson's brother, James Wood Johnson, in the firm. In 1880, Johnson sold his shares to Seabury, and agreed to abstain from the medical business for ten years. Johnson & Johnson Meanwhile, James Wood Johnson and Edward Mead Johnson started a family business called Johnson & Johnson. The firm struggled to remain profitable, as it had insufficient capital for a startup company. While the two brothers were proceeding alone, Seabury was unable to pay RWJ the monthly payments that had been agreed upon when Johnson departed the partnership. Seabury agreed to let Johnson re-enter the medical industry if Seabury could cease making the monthly payments. Johnson agreed, and joined his brothers' firm, providing the capital for a fresh start. The new partnership gave Johnson half of the company's shares in return for management of the company. His brothers received 30% of the company. Johnson toiled heroically, commuting between the factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey and the office in New York. By early 1888, Johnson & Johnson was making $25,000 a month. Kilmer Dr. Frederick Barnett Kilmer owned a pharmacy in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Johnson met Kilmer in early 1887, and developed a lifelong friendship. After meeting Johnson, Kilmer became more involved in Johnson & Johnson. He eventually became an employee and introduced one of the first medical research laboratories. Kilmer was responsible for making many of the innovations in sterilized dressings. The first marketing items Kilmer introduced were medical manuals; guides for how to react when injured aboard trains, such as when feet are crushed or when legs are broken. Later, Kilmer influenced most of America with his new products. By the late 19th century, railroads had covered most of the nation. Americans were traveling more and farther than ever before. To address the medical needs of travelers, Kilmer introduced first-aid kits. The Red Cross symbol became as well known. Soon, people believed that the first-aid kits were as important to them as railroads and light bulbs. It became an American way of life to grab a first-aid kit when in need of help. In 1890, Kilmer received a letter from a colleague seeking advice on treating skin irritation on one of his patients. The patient had used medicated plasters and it was assumed that the plaster caused the irritation. Kilmer sent him a small tin of Italian talc. With the success of this treatment, Johnson & Johnson started including containers of talc with its plasters. Personal life Evangeline Brewster Johnson (Prince Pierre Troubetzkoy, 1922) In 1880, Johnson married Ellen Cutler. They had one child: Roberta Johnson. Johnson later married Evangeline Brewster Armstrong. They had three children: John Seward Johnson I, Robert Wood Johnson II, and Evangeline Johnson. His daughter Evangeline married composer Leopold Stokowski by whom she had two children. In 1910, Johnson died of chronic kidney disease (Bright's disease) at the age of 64.

The Chav√≠n were named after Chav√≠n de Huantar, the main structure found in ruin at this archaeological site. The Chav√≠n are believed to have occupied this space from 900 BCE to 200 BCE, which places them in the Early Horizon period of Andean cultures. The Early Horizon came to rise after the spread and domination of Chav√≠n art styles, namely the hanging pendant eye and anthropomorphism/zoomorphism of feline, serpent, and crocodilian creatures. The stele is seven feet high, made of highly polished granite, with a lightly incised design featuring these key artistic choices shown in the depiction of the Staff God. After not being found in situ (in its original intended position), the stele now is housed in the courtyard of the Museo Nacional de Arqueolog√≠a Antropolog√≠a e Historia del Per√∫ in Lima. A detail of the Raimondi Stele  Finding  Rendered drawing of Raimondi Stele iconography The first modern record of someone writing about their finding of the stele was Jos√© Toribio Polo in 1871, but his sights at the time were more set on the Lanz√≥n. Two years later in 1873, Antonio Raimondi, an Italian-Peruvian naturalist, visited Chav√≠n de Huantar and described the structure as a \\"fortress,\\" taking note of the stele in the ceremonial center. As mentioned previously, the Raimondi Stele was not found in situ, but instead in the home of Timoteo Espinoza, a local farmer. According to Raimondi and other accounts of travelers at the time, the local people of Peru would collect and display objects representative of the past in their homes, aligning themselves with the past while also protecting their history. Once the modern world knew about the existence of the stele, Polo returned and focused his 1891/1892 study on the monolith. After excavations done by Julio C. Tello years later, it was confirmed that structures like the Raimondi Stele existed elsewhere on the grounds (the Tello Obelisk, for example) and led to further investigations of the purposes of these monoliths.  Visual analysis  Chavin artists frequently used the technique of contour rivalry in their art forms, and the Raimondi Stele shows this technique through dualism in the imagery of an indigenous god and its adornments. Contour rivalry means that the lines in an image can be read in multiple ways, depending on which way the object is being viewed, and in Chav√≠n culture it is often used to enlighten those who can understand the iconography and exclude those who can not. When the Raimondi Stela is viewed one way, the image depicts a fearsome deity, the Staff God, holding a staff in each hand that also double as Huachuma (or San Pedro) cactus. Spiritual leaders and elite would drink the juice from the San Pedro Cactus that would elicit a hallucinogenic response, allowing them to become closer to the deities that they honored. The eyes of the figure look upward toward his large, elaborate headdress of snakes and volutes. Contour rivalry is found not only in the physical transformation of the monolith, but also in the iconography. The Staff God's staffs are also vegetation, his belt is also a face, the ears of the face on the belt are snakes, and his headdress is made up of caiman. When flipped upside-down, the same image can be seen differently. The headdress can be \\"read\\" as a stacked row of smiling, fanged faces, while the deity's face has turned into the face of a smiling reptile. The deity's staffs also appear to be rows of stacked faces. This technique speaks to larger Andean concerns of the duality and reciprocal nature of nature, life, and society. The idea of transformation (through flipping a stone structure, making an image out of other images, or taking hallucinogens) is intrinsic to the Chav√≠n cosmology. This theme is found in the art of many other Andean indigenous civilizations.  Cosmology  The main figure in the image on the Raimondi Stele is the Staff God, an anthropomorphic creature that exhibits human, feline, reptilian, and avian characteristics. The animals represented were highly mythologized and rumored in Andean cultures because of their geographic location. They are all apex predators and lived in the jungles just above the mountain ranges, using their power and prowess to thrive. These characteristics of strength reflect on what was thought of the Staff God, considering he was the main deity of the Chav√≠n, showing his all- encompassing power and rule. The duality of the Raimondi Stele is shown throughout the entire structure. The image is perfectly symmetrical, placing an emphasis on the mirroring and double-imaging shown. Part of understanding the stele is in the looking; the whole structure would have to be turned upside down to see the other image. Because the Staff God is so paramount to the Chav√≠n worldview, the image was made difficult to see to separate those within the community from those outside.Weismantel, Mary J. / Inhuman eyes : Looking at Chav√≠n de Huantar. Relational Archaeologies: Humans, Animals, Things. Taylor and Francis, 2014. pp. 21-41 The interaction with the stone is not passive, it requires the viewer to become active in the knowing of this deity by either moving their head and body to see the other side, physically lifting the stone to flip the double image, or simply just focusing on the low relief that the stele was carved in to really observe all that is happening in the imagery. The transformation of the stone object reflects the transformation that the viewers of the Raimondi Stele would so often undergo. The duality shown through double meaning and contour rivalry is indicative of the importance of duality in their everyday lives: night and day, rainy and dry season, life and death, etc. ReferencesExternal links * Raimondi Stele Full Image Category:Chavin culture Category:Steles Category:Granite sculptures Category:Peruvian art Category:Pre-Columbian art ","title":"Raimondi Stele"},{"id":"3812008","text":"Boron deficiency is a pathology which may occur in animals due to a lack of boron.

This pathologic state is sometimes, but not always, associated with Sj√∂gren's syndrome. Presentation Benign lymphoepithelial lesion is most likely to occur in adults around 50 years of age. There is a predilection for gender with 60‚Äì80% being female. The gland affected has a diffuse swelling. The swelling can be asymptomatic, but mild pain can also be associated. There is a preponderance of this disease in those who suffer from HIV infection. Most cases of benign lymphoepithelial lesions appear in conjunction with Sj√∂gren's syndrome. When Sj√∂gren's syndrome is present, the swelling is usually bilateral. Otherwise, the affected glands are usually only on one side of the body. In many cases, a biopsy is needed to distinguish benign lymphoepithelial lesions from sialadenosis (sialosis). Locations In 80% of cases, the parotid gland is affected. Lacrimal glands are also affected. Histology Section from salivary gland showing dense lymphoid infiltrate around and within ductal epithelium-Lympho epithelial lesion (H&E;,100X) There is a marked lymphoplasmacytic infiltration. Lymphoid follicles surround solid epithelial nests, giving rise to the 'epimyoepithelial islands', that are mainly composed of ductal cells with occasional myoepithelial cells. Excess hyaline basement membrane material is deposited between cells, and there is also acinar atrophy and destruction. Treatment Treatment usually consists of observation unless the patient has concern, there is pain, drainage, or other symptoms related to the lesion. Surgical removal of the affected gland would be recommended in those cases. Another treatment option would be aspiration, which can be repeated multiple times. This is commonly performed in those who are debilitated or in those whose benefit from surgery would be outweighed by the risks. Prognosis is usually good; rarely this condition may devolve into lymphoma, or could actually represent 'occult' lymphoma from the outset. Eponym Historically, bilateral parotid and lacrimal gland enlargement was characterized by the term Mikulicz's disease if the enlargement appeared apart from other diseases. If it was secondary to another disease, such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, and Sj√∂gren's syndrome, the term used was Mikulicz's syndrome. Both names derive from Jan Mikulicz-Radecki, the Polish surgeon best known for describing these conditions. \\\\- \\"Mikulicz's disease\\" \\\\- \\"Mikulicz's syndrome\\" In more recent times, the terms \\"Mikulicz's disease\\" and \\"Mikulicz's syndrome\\" were viewed as ambiguous and outdated by some sources. Today Mikulicz's disease is considered to be a subtype of IgG4-related disease, usually accompanied by involvement of one or more other organs in the body.

There are also a number of variants within the definition of Milas carpets. These variants are called under such names as Ada Milas, Patlƒ±canlƒ±, Cƒ±ngƒ±llƒ± Cafer, Gemisuyu, and Elikoynunda, depending on the style, colors and other characteristics. Milas region and the T√ºrkmen tradition Milas is one of the regions in Turkey whose inhabitants kept their T√ºrkmen heritage in its liveliest (the term T√ºrkmen is often used in Turkey to denote ties to the former semi-nomadic lifestyle). As aside clothing and traditions, this heritage also includes the art of carpet weaving. It is generally admitted that a distinctive breed of Milas rugs came into existence in the 16th century starting with the \\"seccade\\", prayer rugs which are smaller in dimension. By the 18th century and the 19th century, two types of Milas rugs, traditional (or classical) and baroque, could be distinguished on the basis of their colors and designs. Classical Milas carpets A Milas prayer rug on the floor at left, with the Koran and \\"rahle\\" ‚Äî the reading stool ‚Äî in an 1890 painting by Osman Hamdi Bey \\"Two young girls visiting a shrine\\". Classical Milas carpets and rugs are those that can be said to have kept the essentials of the original 16th-century prayer rugs, with a usually rectangular niche (\\"mihr√¢b\\") in their fore to indicate the spot where the forehead of the faithful touches the rug at the moment of kneeling during the prayer. The inner frame of this niche is garnished with plant motifs and above the niche is a specially designed field called √¢lem, with references to heavenly promises. The type called \\"Ada Milas\\" is one of the oldest examples of classical Milas rugs. The name may have derived, according to different versions, from the queen Ada of Caria, a native of this very region and a contemporary of Alexander the Great, or from a hypothesis according to which this type of rugs was first woven by immigrants from the island of ƒ∞stank√∂y (Cos), \\"ada\\" meaning \\"island\\" in Turkish, or from the stylized carnation bouquets (another signification of the word \\"ada\\") sometimes depicted as placed on a branch around the rug. Many other such styles, such as cat's paws, soles, notches, always depicted in an abstract manner, exist. These side decorations always follow a repetitive order around the circumference of the rug, and their row is called a \\"water bed\\" (\\"su yataƒüƒ±\\"). Milas carpets in Baroque style Baroque style Milas rugs bear the echoes of the European influence densely introduced in the art and architecture of the Ottoman Empire starting with the reign of the Sultan Abdulmecid I in early 19th century. In these, zigzagging flower designs replace the orderly and abstract motifs of classical Milas rugs. Medalled Milas carpets Yet another group of Milas carpets and rugs, this time distinguished on the basis of their initial conception, are the ones referred to as \\"medalled\\". Their prototype has appeared in the village of Karacahisar near Milas, and this village and its vicinity is still producing carpets and rugs based on the same pattern, which are also called Karacahisar carpets and rugs, considered inside the category of Milas carpets and rugs. Instead of the niche and the alem placed in the fore as in the prayer rug tradition, Karacahisar carpets and rugs are characterized by a centrally situated and larger field called \\"belly\\" (\\"g√∂bek\\") with medal-like designs around, as well as abstract patterns of leaves and branches which are woven along the sides of the carpet. They are woven on a bed of white and red, regardless of the proportion these colors may occupy at the final stage of the finished product. Prayer rug types are usually woven in a tighter manner, and Karacahisar carpets and rugs looser. Colors For the final colors, brown, peculiar tones of reddish brown and of a very dark yellow are distinctive tints of Milas carpets and rugs. Wool has established itself as the main material for Milas rugs as of the 18th century, and the natural dyes are still widely used. Although industrial dyes of our day can more or less fully replace the savour and resistance of naturally obtained dyes, natural dyes will mature in the same manner as traditional rugs. The yellow is obtained from leaves of peach and apricot trees, the distinctive reddish brown (which is also frequently encountered in artefacts dating from the Carians, the inhabitants of the same region in antiquity) from Erica vulgaris, the brown from walnut leaves, the very dark, brownish yellow from acorns, the green from mint, and the wool is blackened by leaving it in the ground for a week. Weaving centers Karacahisar (near Milas) and Gereme (on the coast) carpets and rugs are the two most frequently woven Milas carpet and rug types in our day, each type considered as the specialty of a different group of villages. The villages which regularly weave Milas rugs are mainly, but not exclusively, situated south of the city of Milas, such as Karacahisar, √ñren (Gereme), √áomakdaƒü, D√∂rttepe, Bozalan, ƒ∞kizk√∂y, Pƒ±nark√∂y, Mezgit, G√ºrceƒüiz, Ak√ßakaya villages. Tighter Ada Milas rugs are usually woven on demand. Impact of international tourism Thanks to nearby Bodrum having become an international tourist venue and an intellectual center, Milas carpets and rugs occupy a privileged position among different Turkish carpet weaving traditions and they have entered into fashion trends both in and outside Turkey. For the whole territory of Milas district, up to 7000 weavers' looms remain in activity, full-time or at intervals following the demand.

Biography  The band was created in the summer of 1988 around √ûorvaldur Bjarni √ûorvaldsson, a vocalist, guitarist, and record producer. In the beginning, all 3 members were part of local bands and studying at the Reykjav√≠k College of Music in May 1989. \\"Sameiginlegt\\" was the name of their first demo, which made it onto the first studio album, Betra En Nokku√∞ Anna√∞. The following year, their most memorable self-titled album was released to rave reviews and respectability for their live concerts. This was followed by the release of their debut English-language songs \\"Opera\\" and \\"All Around\\". After the huge success of the Spillt album in 1993, the members of Todmobile moved onto other projects. Ey√æ√≥r joined a band called Bong, which had moderate success in 1994 in both Iceland and the UK. Andrea fronted a swing band called Citysister while collaborating with √ûorvaldur in 1994 to form Tweety, who made music in the dance/rock and pop genres, and she also took the lead role of Eva Per√≥n in the Icelandic production of Evita. In February 1996, after fans wrote to Andrea and √ûorvaldur pleading for them to revive Todmobile, they re-formed under the original name of Todmobile. Andrea, √ûorvaldur and new lead singer Vilhj√°lmur Go√∞i released their \\"comeback\\" CD titled Perlur og sv√≠n and once again started touring shortly after the album. Solo projects once again ensued, √ûorvaldur being the main success after co-writing the Icelandic ESC 1999 entry \\"All Out Of Luck\\" for Selma Bj√∂rnsd√≥ttir, which placed second. In 2003 Todmobile released their first live CD and DVD ‚Äì Sinf√≥n√≠a, which was a compilation of all their hits with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra.

History In the 1930s and 1940s, Indio Public Schools consisted of Washington, Roosevelt, Jackson, Lincoln and Hoover schools, with the Jefferson school the sole junior high-level facility. In 1966, voters approved the consolidation of the Indio Elementary School District and the Coachella Valley Joint Union High School District, with some smaller elementary districts, into one, 760 square mile, district called Desert Sands Unified School District. The district initially served about 6,600 students. In 2010, using funds provided by the Magnet Schools Assistance Program, two elementary schools were converted to magnet schools: the Carrillo Ranch Elementary Visual and Performing Arts Magnet School and the John F. Kennedy Elementary Math and Science Magnet School. In 2016, the school district celebrated its 50th anniversary with an exhibit at the Coachella Valley History Museum, a former one-room school house built in 1909. 7 Things you need to know about Desert Sands Unified School District In 2016-2017, Desert Sands began offering full- day Kindergarten at all schools (except for Washington Charter) in order to help prepare students and increase reading and writing skills. The expansion was funded by the district's Local Control and Accountability Plan. In 2017, Students in the Desert Sands Unified School District outperformed the other Coachella Valley school districts on statewide tests. In the 2018-19 school year, the school district launched a new One to World device initiative titled Connect. Chromebooks are used district-wide for grades 2-12 and the devices are being issued each year alongside textbooks. Students needing a wifi connection at home can also be issued a mifi device to connect to the district's network.

The parish has a population of 508. It lies between Chew Valley Lake and Blagdon Lake, north of the Mendip Hills, approximately south of Bristol on the A368 road Weston-super-Mare to Bath, between Blagdon and West Harptree. A spring rises near the church and feeds the village duck pond, which used to power a paper mill, and ultimately becomes the River Yeo. The Big Green Gathering takes place at Fernhill Farm above the village.  History  There is evidence of habitation of the area from prehistoric times and the Romans mined lead in the local hill. According to Robinson it is listed in the 1086 Domesday Book as Comtona. The Manor of Compton was given by William the Conqueror to Serlo de Burci. In the reign of Henry I of England it passed to his grandson, Robert fitz Martin, who gave the village the latter half of its name. The parish was part of the hundred of Chewton. In the 14th century the Manor passed to the Wake family. Alice, wife of Ralph de Wake, was tried and sentenced to be burned for the murder of her husband. Perhaps she is the inspiration for the legendary White Lady, a ghostly figure said to haunt the parish. Compton Martin was the birthplace of Saint Wulfric (1080‚Äì1154), hermit and miracle worker. Around 1500 teazle farming for use in the weaving of cloth became a major local industry. In 1770 a new whipping post was installed by the pond for corporal punishment for minor offences such as petty larceny, vagrancy or absence from church. The organ at Frenchay Unitarian Church came from the former Compton Martin Methodist Church in 1980. On 14 March 1944, during World War II a United States Navy Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber crashed near the village with the loss of five lives. In August 2010 the village had a surprise visit and performance by singer Kylie Minogue at the Ring O‚ÄôBells pub. Compton Martin Ochre Mine is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).  Governance  The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. Compton Martin is part of the Chew Valley South Ward, which is represented by one councillor on the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non- metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of Clutton Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It was also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament, prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected six MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.  Demographics  Compton Martin duck pond According to the 2001 Census, the Chew Valley South Ward (which includes Nempnett Thrubwell), had 1,032 residents, living in 411 households, with an average age of 42.1 years. Of these 74% of residents describing their health as 'good', 20% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no qualifications; and the area had an unemployment rate of 1.7% of all economically active people aged 16‚Äì74. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, it was ranked at 22,950 out of 32,482 wards in England, where 1 was the most deprived LSOA and 32,482 the least deprived.  Church of St Michael the Archangel  Church of St Michael the Archangel, Compton Martin The church, which was built in the Norman period, is dedicated to St Michael the Archangel. Norman vaulting can be seen in the chancel and Jacobean work in choir stalls and organ screen. The tower is approached from the nave via a lofty Tudor panelled arch which together with the tower itself dates from the early 16th century. It is some high and contains six 18th-century bells, five of which were cast by the Bilbies of Chew Stoke. In the north wall is a recess containing the effigy of Thomas de Moreton which was discovered in 1858. Above the ceiling of the Bickfield Chapel there is a void which contains a columbarium or dovecote. This housed 140 \\"squabs\\" or pigeons in 1606 for the rector's table. The church is a Grade I listed building (), and several of the monuments in the churchyard also have listed status; (), (), () Wade and Wade in their 1929 book \\"Somerset\\" described the church as \\"quite remarkable\\" \\"The church is one of the finest bits of Norm. work in the county. The nave is entirely late Norm., and possesses the unusual feature of a clerestory. The fine arcades, with their cylindrical columns and circular abaci, are too obvious to escape notice, but particular attention should be paid to the twisted pillar on the N.E. The chancel has an extremely low quadripartite vault, the effect of which is rather spoilt by the distortion of the chancel arch through some defect in the foundations. The aisles are Perp., and the one on the S. curiously encloses the clerestory. Note (1) the junction of the Perp. arch and Norm. pillars, (2) recessed effigy of a lady at E. end of N. aisle, (3) semi-circular recess, probably for additional altar (cp. Cudworth); (4) Norm. font on a fluted pedestal, (5) Perp. screen, said to have been an importation. There is a Perp.

Ascension Island is an island in the South Atlantic Ocean, part of the wider British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.

Early days Originally mail was carried on an irregular basis as ships called. A datestamp was in use from February 1858, and in 1863 the Union Steamship Co. began regular carriage of mail, continuing until 1977.

First stamps  On 2 November 1922, nine stamps of St. Helena overprinted \\"ASCENSION\\" replaced British stamps. These were followed up in 1924 by a series of 12 using the St. Helena design but inscribed for Ascension. In 1934 a pictorial series of ten engraved stamps depicted various views of the island.  George VI  In 1938 the pictorials were re-issued with a portrait of George VI replacing his father's image. Various colour and perforation changes ensued, with the last being issued in February 1953.  Queen Elizabeth  A new definitive series of 13 in 1956 resembled the previous stamps, but was a little taller, and used maps and pictures of native animals in addition to local scenes. No further stamps were issued until 1963 when there was a series of 14 featuring birds. From 1963 on, commemorative and special issues started to appear more frequently.

Internationally he is perhaps most well known for writing the book Cosmos 1999: L'√©pop√©e de la blancheur (DLM Editions, Paris: 1996), a highly acclaimed socio-cultural analysis of Gerry Anderson's TV-series Space: 1999.

He is the songwriter and keyboard player. Cosmos 1999: L'√©pop√©e de la blancheur Fageolle's analysis of Space: 1999 has been positively compared and contrasted with similar books, like Exploring Space: 1999 by John Kenneth Muir, and is often considered to be the deepest analysis of the series published so far.Willey, M. Space: 1999 Merchandise Guide, http://www.space1999.net/catacombs/main/merc/vmb.html The main focus of his analysis is on the symbolism of the series as a whole, seeing the main trio of writers as representing different interpretations of the world. In the writings of Johnny Byrne he sees a Catholic interpretation of the world, in Christopher Penfold he sees a Protestant worldview, and in Edward di Lorenzo he identifies a secular worldview based on psycho-analysis. He also makes important contributions to the interpretation of individual episodes by comparing the writing with French nouveau roman author Michel Butor, and otherwise he makes use of the psycho-analysis of Bruno Bettelheim for adding insights on subtext. Fageolle's interpretation of the visual aspects of the series, and how the visuals interplay with the music, is based on Wassily Kandinsky's philosophy of the spiritual in art.

The vessel was named for Samuel Gompers, a distinguished American labor leader during the late nineteenth century. Samuel Gompers was laid down on 9 July 1964 by the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington and launched on 14 May 1966; sponsored by Mrs. Joseph Holmes. The destroyer tender was commissioned on 1 July 1967, Capt. Harry Risch, Jr., in command. Service history=1967-1969 After her commissioning, Samuel Gompers spent the next several months in initial outfitting, with acceptance trials taking place from 28 August to 1 September. On 3 October, she got underway for her designated home port, San Diego. The next month, the destroyer tender underwent various inspections as she was to be deployed to the western Pacific without the benefit of a prior shakedown cruise. This necessitated that a high degree of readiness be attained in a short period of time. All inspections showed that the ship was ready for sea, and she departed San Diego on 10 November for Pearl Harbor. Following a weapons transfer from , Samuel Gompers stood out of Pearl Harbor on 20 November bound for Yokosuka, Japan. Upon arriving there on 30 November 1967, she began providing fleet repair support to the operating forces of the Pacific Fleet. In the first month of availability, her repair department accomplished job orders for 54 different ships and other activities. Samuel Gompers departed Yokosuka for Sasebo on 13 January 1968. Her \\"in port\\" period there was originally scheduled on 25 January. However, the capture of by North Korea brought increased activity by the Pacific Fleet in the Sea of Japan as part of Operation Formation Star. The destroyer tender's services were required to maintain the destroyer screen for the five aircraft carriers then alternating port visits to Sasebo. Seventy-one ships were serviced there before the AD departed. On 18 March, Samuel Gompers sailed to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, for three weeks. She anchored in mid-stream and serviced 17 ships before departing for Hong Kong, B.C.C.; Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines; and San Diego. Her first deployment ended on 8 May when she arrived at her home port. One month later, she moved to Bremerton for a period of yard availability. She embarked over 200 dependents to make the voyage up the west coast. On 27 July, Samuel Gompers stood out of Bremerton, with the dependents aboard, and returned to San Diego. From 30 July to 15 November, she serviced ships there. On 15 November, the tender departed San Diego, with Task Unit (TU) 15.8.2, bound for Subic Bay, via Pearl Harbor and Guam, and her second WestPac deployment. The Task Unit included the destroyers , , and destroyer leader . She provided underway replenishment for the accompanying ships three times during the transit, including hi-lining a seaman from Swenson for an emergency operation on Thanksgiving Day, 28 November. From 8 December 1968 to 13 May 1969, she performed fleet repair services in Subic Bay. Capt. Risch was relieved by Captain Claiborne S. Bradley on 3 January 1969. The period was broken by one five-day visit to Hong Kong. On 13 May, the AD sailed to Yokosuka for a short period of rest and recreation, from whence she sailed to the west coast, arriving on 4 June. 1970-1973 Samuel Gompers operated in the San Diego area until 13 March 1970 when she again deployed to the western Pacific, under command of her Executive Officer, Commander Pete Watson, while Capt. Bradley was on emergency leave. After making a port call at Pearl Harbor, she moored at Subic Bay. Except for five days rest and recreation in Hong Kong in June, with 164 Navy dependents from Subic Bay, the tender operated out of that port until 7 July 1970 when she sailed for Yokosuka, Japan, arriving 10 July. The ship's second change of command took place on 1 August 1970 when Captain Daniel L. Banks relieved Captain Bradley. She departed Japan and arrived in San Diego on 13 September 1970. She remained there until 2 November 1971 when she steamed west on another deployment. She made port calls in Pearl Harbor and Yokosuka. During her next nine-month deployment period, Samuel Gompers made two trips to Da Nang, South Vietnam, from 9 to 16 April; and from 22 to 30 April. During her deployment she picked up the nickname \\"FATSAM\\" for Fast Attack Tender, Samuel Gompers. When she reached her home port on 31 July, she remained there to provide repair services to fleet units until mid-July 1973. At this time, she moved up the coast to Portland, Oregon, entering a dry dock period at Swan Island Shipyard and was in dry dock having significant modifications to service areas far below the waterline. Boiler and fuel system modifications took place at this time. She was converted from burning Navy Bunker C, black oil to Naval Distillate fuel. Flooring in the mess decks and most crew heads was updated. She was reported to be the largest vessel ever to cruise up the Columbia River. A large metal hinge had to be welded to the top few feet of the mast and then the mast was cut and tipped down to allow passage under one of the bridges encountered along her Columbia River passage. Samuel Gompers remained there until returning to San Diego in early December. In 1972 the ship was deployed to Da Nang Harbor. The ship carried very few large weapons, which left her constantly vulnerable to enemy attack. In that deployment the ship was nicknamed \\"FAT Sam\\", a humorous suggestion that she was a \\"Fast Attack Tender.\\" Female crewmembers In October 1978, while in San Diego, Samuel Gompers took women on board as crew members for the first time; one of the first ships in the fleet to do so. In the next few years, all destroyer tenders, and all non-combative auxiliaries, would have women aboard. Combat ships other than submarines would follow suit beginning in the 1990s. 1984-1988 During WestPac 1984, Samuel Gompers would score another first: it became the first ship to do a major engine changeout while deployed, and not in port. The service was provided to the while both were anchored together off the coast of Oman in the Indian Ocean. Just a few months after this WestPac ended, the ties with San Diego ended, and Samuel Gompers docked at her new homeport of Alameda, California. The destroyer tender deployed on another WESTPAC in January 1988. Samuel Gompers stayed in the Gulf of Oman from March 1988 until late June 1988 supporting Operation Ernest Will and Operation Praying Mantis before returning to her home port. Decommissioning and awards On 2 October 1995 Samuel Gompers arrived in Norfolk, Virginia in preparation for decommissioning ceremonies, which took place 27 October. The principal speaker was Rear Admiral James F. Amerault, Commander, Western Hemisphere Group, and a former Samuel Gompers skipper. The ship had completed 28 years of active service by then, being awarded the Vietnam Service, Southwest Asia, Navy Expeditionary, and Humanitarian Service medals; Navy Unit and Joint Meritorious Unit commendations; Letter of Commendation from the Secretary of the Navy; and five Battle \\"E\\" Ribbons.  Sinking  On 22 July 2003, Samuel Gompers was sunk in the Atlantic as part of a fleet training exercise (SINKEX). EX-Samuel Gompers departed Portsmouth at 08:30 on 18 July 2003 under tow of en route to her SINKEX position. Three ships were sent to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of North Carolina: destroyer tender Samuel Gompers, fleet tug and submarine tender . Of the three ships, Samuel Gompers was the last to be sunk, and slipped beneath the waves at 00:06 on 22 July 2003. The first Harpoon missile to strike Samuel Gompers was from the guided-missile destroyer , designation Cole 4. Reports indicate it took 16 Harpoon missiles ( each) and over of ordnance to sink Samuel Gompers. When the Harpoons finished, a squadron of bombers dropped bombs on her to sink her.

Prior to European contact, Eastern Algonquian consisted of at least 17 languages, whose speakers collectively occupied the Atlantic coast of North America and adjacent inland areas, from what are now the Maritimes of Canada to North Carolina. The available information about individual languages varies widely. Some are known only from one or two documents containing words and phrases collected by missionaries, explorers or settlers, and some documents contain fragmentary evidence about more than one language or dialect. Nearly all of the Eastern Algonquian languages are extinct. MiÍûåkmaq and Malecite- Passamaquoddy have appreciable numbers of speakers, but Western Abenaki and Lenape (Delaware) are each reported to have fewer than 10 speakers after 2000. Eastern Algonquian constitutes a separate genetic subgroup within Algonquian. Two other recognized groups of Algonquian languages, Plains Algonquian and Central Algonquian, are geographic but do not refer to genetic subgroupings. Classification A consensus classification of the known Eastern Algonquian languages and dialects by Goddard (1996) is given below with some emendation, for example treatment of Massachusett and Narragansett as distinct languages. In the case of poorly attested languages, particularly in southern New England, conclusive classification of written records as representing separate languages or dialects may be ultimately impossible. Headings in upper case denote proposed subgroups within Eastern Algonquian. * Abenakian ** MiÍûåkmaq ** Abenaki ***Western Abenaki ***Eastern Abenaki ‚Ä† ** Maliseet-Passamaquoddy ** Etchemin? ‚Ä† * Southern New England ‚Ä† **Massachusett ‚Ä† *** Wompanoag (New Massachusett) ** Narragansett ‚Ä† ** Loup A? ‚Ä† ** Loup B? ‚Ä† ** Quiripi ‚Ä† ** Mohegan-Pequot ‚Ä† * Delawaran ** Mahican ‚Ä† ** Delaware *** Munsee *** Unami ‚Ä† * Nanticockan ** Nanticoke ‚Ä† ** Piscataway ‚Ä† * Powhatan ‚Ä† * Pamlico ‚Ä† Eastern Algonquian as a genetic subgroup, pro and con The languages assigned to the Eastern Algonquian group are hypothesized to descend from an intermediate common ancestor proto-language, referred to as Proto-Eastern Algonquian (PEA). By virtue of their common ancestry, the Eastern Algonquian languages constitute a genetic subgroup, and the individual Eastern Algonquian languages descend from PEA. By contrast, other Algonquian languages are hypothesized to descend directly from Proto-Algonquian, the ultimate common language ancestor of the Algonquian languages. In historical linguistics in general, the primary criterion for status as a genetic subgroup is that there are shared innovations assigned to the proposed subgroup that cannot be assigned to the ultimate ancestor language. A complex series of phonological and morphological innovations define Eastern Algonquian as a subgroup. \\"There is less diversity, by any measure, among [Eastern Algonquian languages] as a group than among the Algonquian languages as a whole or among the non-Eastern languages.\\" The validity of PEA as a genetic subgroup has been disputed by Pentland and Proulx. Pentland questions the Eastern Algonquian status of the southern New England languages and Powhatan and Carolina Algonquian. Proulx has proposed that the similarities can be explained as the result of diffusion. Goddard has countered that the extent of the similarities would require extensive diffusion very early in the breakup of the Eastern Algonquian languages and that such a position would be difficult in principle to differentiate from analyzing PEA as a genetic subgroup. Eastern Algonquian subgroupings Similarities among subsets of some of the Eastern Algonquian languages have led to several proposals for further subgroupings within Eastern Algonquian: Abenakian, Southern New England Algonquian (SNEA), and Delawaran, with the latter consisting of Mahican and Common Delaware, a further subgroup. The amount of evidence for each subgrouping varies, and the incomplete record for many parts of the Eastern Algonquian area makes interpretation of relations between the languages difficult. As well, diffusion means that some common features may have spread beyond their original starting point through contact, and as a result, a number of characteristics occur in a language assigned to a proposed subgroup, but the same feature is also found in other adjacent languages that are not analyzed as part of the subgroup in question. Appeal to both genetic subgroups and areal diffusion is required. Goddard notes: \\"Each Eastern Algonquian language shares features with each of its immediate neighbors, and the resulting continuum is of a sort that is likely to have resulted from the spread of linguistic innovations among forms of speech that were already partly differentiated but still similar enough to make partial bilingualism easy.\\"Goddard, Ives, 1978, p. 70 Proceeding north to south, the languages of the Maritimes and New England are strongly differentiated from those farther south (Mahican, the Delaware languages, Nanticoke, Carolina Algonquian, and Powhatan). At the same time the Southern New England languages (discussed below) share significant similarities, indicating a closer degree of relationship between them.Goddard, Ives, 1978, p. 76 Micmac has innovated significantly relative to other Eastern Algonquian languages, particularly in terms of grammatical features, but it shares a number of phonological innovations and lexical features with Maliseet-Passamaquoddy and Eastern and Western Abenaki. =Abenakian= The proposed Abenakian subdivision comprises Eastern and Western Abenaki as well as Maliseet-Passamaquoddy; several phonological innovations are shared by the three languages.Goddard, Ives, 1978, p. 74, p. 75 Table 2; Goddard, Ives, 1996, p. 5 = Southern New England Algonquian (SNEA) = Goddard notes the similarities shared by the Southern New England languages.Goddard, Ives, 1978, p. 74, p. 75, Table 2 Siebert made the first explicit proposal for a Southern New England subgroup.Siebert, Frank, 1975, pp. 442-443, 445-446 Costa develops the proposal in some detail, providing arguments based upon several shared innovations found within SNEA.Costa, David, 2007 Costa, largely following Siebert, proposes that the following languages are assigned to SNEA: Massachusett, Narragansett, Mohegan-Pequot-Montauk (probably also including Western and Niantic), Quiripi-Naugatuck, Unquachog, and Loup A.Costa, David, 2007, pp. 81-82 Etchemin may also have been part of this group but the very small amount of material available precludes a more definitive conclusion. Costa outlines three sound changes that are innovations uniquely assignable to Proto-Eastern Algonquian, and hence constitute evidence for the subgrouping (the asterisk denotes a reconstructed sound in the proto-language: (a) palatalization of Proto-Eastern-Algonquian (PEA) *k; (b) merger of PEA consonant clusters *hr and *hx; (c) shift of word-final PEA *r to ≈°, all of which occur in Massachusett phonology.Costa, David, 2007, pp. 84-90 As well, refining a proposal made by Siebert, Costa adduces evidence indicating an east-west split with the SNEA subgroup. On both phonological and lexical grounds, a distinction within SNEA can be made between a Western SNEA group consisting of the languages of central and Eastern Long Island, Connecticut and southern Rhode Island: Mohegan-Pequot-Montauk, Quiripi-Naugatuck, and Unquachog; and an Eastern group consisting of Massachusett and Narragansett. Loup, probably aboriginally found on the northern border of the Western SNEA area and to the west of Massachusett, would appear to share features of the Western and Eastern subgroups.Costa, David, 2007, pp. 99-102 =Delawaran and Common Delaware= The closely related Lenape (Delaware) languages Munsee and Unami form a subgroup, with the two languages descending from an immediate ancestor called Common Delaware (CD).Goddard, Ives, 1978, p. 74; Goddard, Ives, 1982 Goddard notes a small number of innovations in morphology and phonology that set Munsee and Unami off from their neighbours.Goddard, Ives, 1978, pp. 74, 75 As well, similarities between the Delaware languages and Mahican have been recognized in that Mahican shares innovations with Munsee and Unami, suggesting a subgroup containing Common Delaware and Mahican; this group has been referred to as Delawaran.Goddard, Ives, 1996, p. 5; Goddard, Ives, 1978, pp. 74, 75 See also *Algonquian languages *Algonquian peoples *Proto-Algonquian language FootnotesNotesReferences * Campbell, Lyle. 2004.

The major activities of the mint are minting and melting circulation and commemorative coins, and producing commemorative medals and other kind of casting products for government institutions and businesses in Taiwan. History The mint was originally established as Shanghai Mint in Shanghai in 1920. In 1928, Northern Expedition forces led by the Kuomintang took over Shanghai, and the Shanghai Mint was renamed Central Mint and became the subordinate of Ministry of Finance. Australian-Chinese merchant George Kwok Bew was appointed head of the Central Mint. Kwok was an associate of Sun Yat-sen and also managing director of Wing On. Five years later in 1933, the company started its operation in minting. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the company had to be relocated inland of Mainland China in which facilities were set up in Chengtu, Kweilin, Kunming, Lanchow and Wuchang. In 1946 after the National Revolutionary Army won the war against the Japanese, the company relocated back to Shanghai. In 1949, in the later stages of the Chinese Civil War, Shanghai was taken over by Communist forces. Part of the Central Mint was evacuated to Taiwan, while the remaining equipment and personnel were received by the Communist military administration in May 1949 and reorganised as \\"the People's Mint\\", now the Shanghai Mint, a subsidiary of China Banknote Printing and Minting. The Central Mint officially relocated to Taiwan in May 1949 and facilities were set up in Taipei. It then became the subordinate of the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan).

In 1270, she tended the sick and gave shelter to Beguine Mechthild of Magdeburg. Gertrude of Hackeborn is not to be confused with St. Gertrude the Great. The abbess never wrote anything, nor did she receive any revelations from God or become canonized. Gertrude the Great was born more than twenty years after her and lived as an ordinary nun in the Helfa convent.

Written by Roxy frontman Bryan Ferry, the song was recorded by the band in July 1972 at London's Command Studios. Backed with \\"The Numberer\\", an instrumental composed by Andy Mackay, as a single the song became a Top 10 hit in the UK, peaking at number four. The song was not included on the band's original UK debut album, Roxy Music, having not even been recorded when the album was released. After the success of the album in the UK, it was included on later re-issues. In 1977, it was re-released as a single, together with \\"Pyjamarama\\", originally the second Roxy Music single, to promote the Greatest Hits album, and reached number 11. Both \\"Virginia Plain\\" and \\"The Numberer\\" can be found on the 1995 The Thrill of it All boxset. \\"Virginia Plain\\" features bass guitarist Rik Kenton, who joined after Graham Simpson left the band. It begins with a deceptively quiet introduction, followed by an instant increase of volume as soon as the vocals come in on the first verse. Former art student Ferry took the title \\"Virginia Plain\\" from one of his own paintings, featuring an image of cigarette packaging - \\"Virginia Plain\\" is a variety of cigarette tobacco. Ferry later said in an interview: > It was a watercolour or a painting on paper. It was just like a surreal > drawing of a giant cigarette packet, with a pin-up girl on it.

The 519 serves both its local neighbourhood and the broader lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities in the Toronto area. The 519 defines its local neighbourhood by a catchment area that spans from Bloor Street to the north to Gerrard Street to the south, and from Bay Street in the west to Parliament Street in the east. According to the centre's website, \\"The 519 is the hub of community life in Toronto's diverse Church and Wellesley Village. For over 35 years, The 519 has been working with [its] neighbours and [its] lesbian, gay, bi, trans and queer (LGBTQ) communities to build healthy, welcoming spaces to meet, participate and celebrate together.\\" Governance model The 519 is one of the City of Toronto's agencies and corporations, alongside organizations like Build Toronto, Exhibition Place and the Toronto Public Library. Led by a community board of directors, rather than the city's parks and recreations department, The 519 leverages community insight, knowledge and resources to determine usage of the building. In 2012, for every $1 the City of Toronto provided to keep the building open and operational for the public, the 519 brought over $2 in community investment to provide programming Board of management The 519's board of management includes the Ward 27 City Councillor Kristyn Wong- Tam (ex-officio) and 11 citizens. Citizen members of the board are elected by members of the 519 who are residents of the catchment area. The board of management is subsequently appointed by the Toronto and East York Community Council, a delegated body of Toronto City Council. The board operates from a modified Policy Governance model which ensures delegation of day-to-day leadership of the organization to the executive director, Maura Lawless. The board is currently led by chair Margo Foster, who currently manages academic programs at Seneca College. Association of Community Centres The 519 is a member of the Association of Community Centres (AOCCs), which comprises 10 volunteer board-run multi-purpose facilities providing a broad range of community, recreation and social service programs to residents in the local community. Other AOCC community centres include Swansea Town Hall, Ralph Thornton Community Centre and Harbourfront Community Centre. The AOCC model is a hybrid between a city agency and an independent, not-for-profit, community- based organization. The core administration activities are funded by the city and treated like a city agency (building maintenance and upkeep, utilities, etc.). Community programming is funded through fund-raising (corporate and individual donations, grants, etc.) and is led by the community-based Board of Management. The 519 is a member agency of the United Way of Greater Toronto and the Toronto Neighbourhood Centres and has received funding from various governments, corporations and foundations including the Community One Foundation and Government of Ontario. Details of the relationship between the City of Toronto and AOCCs are outlined in a relationship framework approved by city council in 2006. Programs and community services The 519's governance model results in the development, evolution and creation of programs and services through community leadership and engagement. The centre offers staff- led programming funded through community investment as well as community-led initiatives that are volunteer-led. Staff-led programs The 519 offers a wide range of staff-led initiatives that serve a diverse community of members,Programs at The 519 Church Street Community Centre including: *Newcomer and Refugee Settlement Services *Sport and Recreation Initiatives *Community Drop-In Programs (Meal Trans, Sunday Drop-In) *Community Support Services (Counselling, Anti-Violence) *Trans Community Services (Trans Youth Mentorship Program, Trans Sex Worker Empowerment Project, Spark: Trans Youth Sports) *Older LGBT Services (Senior Pride Network) *Family and Children Services *Queer Parenting Programs *Social Enterprise Restaurant (FABARNAK) *Research, Education and Training Community-led programs The 519 provides free meeting space and support for community member volunteers and community organizations to develop their own programs.The 519 Space Use Policy In 2013, the 519 housed over 80 community led programs (in areas of community services, education, recreation, and self-help), and welcomed 250 regular user groups (in areas of community fundraising, recreation, professional associations and unions, social activists, social service organizations and tenants‚Äô organizations). The 519 estimates in its 2012 annual report that approximately 35,000 individuals visited the centre over 200,000 times. The 519 also actively supports a number of community-led partnerships such as the AIDS Candelight Vigil, the AIDS Memorial, and volunteer-led legal and tax clinics. Strategic initiatives In addition to ongoing programs and services, the 519 invests organizational resources in a number of strategic initiatives and partnerships that help to create healthier more welcoming communities for its members: Community sport and recreation centre In November 2013, the 519 submitted a report to Toronto City Council seeking authorization to develop a sport and recreation centre in the West Don Lands neighbourhood of Toronto.http://app.toronto.ca/tmmis/viewAgendaItemHistory.do?item=2013.CD25.12 City Council Report: The 519 Sport and Recreation Project The new centre would provide space and services to the local neighbourhood while also providing a home for lesbian, gay, bi, trans (LGBT) sport leagues and recreational organizations in the city. It is believed that this would be the first LGBT athletic centre in the world. The proposal's early supporters include city councillor Pam McConnell, former Olympian and Hart House warden Bruce Kidd, and the Gay and Lesbian International Sport Association. The report was adopted unanimously by the Community Development and Recreation Committee and was adopted on December 18, 2013 by Toronto City Council in a vote of 28-2 with councillor James Pasternak and mayor Rob Ford voting against the proposal.City of Toronto Council Meeting Monitor With this approval, staff of the City of Toronto and the 519 are now authorized to negotiate on a site for the new centre and to build a formal business case for approval by council at a later date. The Village Study The Village Study was a one-year urban and social planning exercise for the Church and Wellesley community that was funded by TD Bank Group and led by the 519 with the support of the Planning Partnership. Questions posed by the study included \\"What is the role of a ‚ÄòLGBTQ village‚Äô in a modern, progressive city?\\" and \\"What must be done to support the Church-Wellesley Village to solidify its role as a major cultural community hub in the Toronto context now and into the future?\\"Paul Gallant, \\"Ready for a Renaissance\\". In Toronto, June 2013. The final report of the Village Study is expected in early 2014 as the community prepares for World Pride. PrideHouseTO The 519 is the trustee of the PrideHouseTO initiative, a collaborative project of more than 15 community organizations working together to make the 2015 Pan American Games the most LGBT-inclusive multi-sport event in history. The PrideHouseTO leadership team includes organizations such as Ryerson University, Egale Canada, the Gay and Lesbian International Sport Association and the Toronto chapter of PFLAG. As trustee, the 519 provides administrative and project management support to the volunteer-led initiative. PrideHouseTO is modeled after the Pride House movement which was founded in 2010 during the 2010 Winter Olympics. Capital expansion In 2001, as use of the building reached capacity, the 519 undertook a process to raise money for a three-story addition to be built onto the existing structure. The 519's capital campaign, chaired by Salah Bachir, successfully raised money from the local community to fund the new wing. The addition of the Salah J. Bachir Wing and the renovation of the original building resulted in a 43 per cent increase in community space. The organization celebrated a grand reopening on May 19, 2010.

Life  Little is known with certainty about his life, but he was probably from Bologna or nearby, and seems to have spent part of his life in Ferrara. He was a Benedictine, and may have been the prior of San Nicol√≤ in Ferrara; in addition he was the organist there in 1407, and he is documented in that cathedral at the beginning of 1427. He also seems to have been connected with the chapel of John XXIII in Bologna, since one of his ballades (Arte psalentes) is probably addressed to the singers in his choir. (He is frequently referred to in manuscripts with the Latin form of his name, \\"Bartolomeus de Bononia\\") Music Bartolomeo is one of only a few native Italian composers of the early 15th century of whom works have survived with reliable attribution; many of the musicians in Italy during the 15th century were foreigners, and it was not until later in the century that there were as many Italians as there were √©migr√©s from northern Europe composing music there. Seven pieces by Bartolomeo have survived, all for three voices: two mass movements, and five secular songs, including a ballade, two ballatas, a rondeau and a virelai. Stylistically all are related to the ars subtilior which flourished in Avignon, Bologna and other regions held by the antipopes during the Western Schism. The two mass movements are among the first ever written which use parody technique, i.e. multi-voice material from another source, in this case two of his own secular songs, is recycled and fitted into a different context. That both he and the first composer of parody movements, Antonio \\"Zachara\\" da Teramo, probably overlapped in their service in the chapel of John XXIII in Bologna, is probably no coincidence. Yet, though Zachara was clearly influential on the younger composer, the techniques used by both composers in their parody movements are quite different‚ÄîZachara's are more free in their usage of the borrowed material while Bartolomeo quoted large, contiguous sections of his secular music around which he composed new melodies.Cuthbert, Michael Scott, ‚ÄúZacara‚Äôs D‚Äôamor Languire and Strategies for Borrowing in the Early Fifteenth-Century Italian Mass,‚Äù in Antonio Zacara da Teramo e il suo tempo, edited by Francesco Zimei, (Lucca: Libreria Musicale Italiana, 2004 [i.e., 2005]), pp. 337‚Äì57.

It is situated north of Wells and south of Bristol, on the northern slope of the Mendip Hills overlooking the Chew Valley. The parish has a population of 644. The parish includes the hamlet of Coley.  History  Church of St Lawrence One suggested explanation for the derivation for the Harptree name is from \\"hartreg\\", an Old English word for a grey hollow. According to Robinson it is listed in the 1086 Domesday Book as Harpetreu meaning 'The military road by the wood' from the Old English herepoep and treow. In November 1887, while searching for the source of a spring, a labourer called William Currell put his pick into a pewter vessel full of Roman coins. The jar was below the surface in swampy ground. It contained 1,496 coins, five ingots of silver and a ring. The coins covered the period between the reigns of Constantine the Great and Gratian. The parish was part of the Winterstoke Hundred. Around 1870-1880 the 'East Harptree Lead Works Co Ltd' mined the area around the village for lead, but this seems to have been largely unsuccessful and did not last for many years. Smitham Chimney is a visible reminder of the work.  Governance  The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. Along with West Harptree and Hinton Blewett, East Harptree is part of the Mendip ward which is represented by one councillor on the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non- metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Clutton Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It was also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament, prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected six MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.  Coley  Coley is a hamlet in East Harptree parish just off the B3114. It is near the Litton Reservoirs which is popular with dog walkers. The hamlet has roughly 100 people living there and has no amenities. Coley is quite often (and wrongly) mistaken to be in the Litton parish. Coley has a little bridge going through the centre which has the River Chew running under the bridge.  Demographics  According to the 2001 census the Mendip ward (which includes West Harptree and Hinton Blewett), had 1,465 residents, living in 548 households, with an average age of 39.0 years. Of these, 79% of residents described their health as 'good', 22% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no qualifications, and the area had an unemployment rate of 1.5% of all economically active people aged 16‚Äì74. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, it was ranked at 25,387 out of 32,482 wards in England, where 1 was the most deprived LSOA and 32,482 the least deprived.  Geography  The nearby Harptree Combe is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and slightly further southwest towards Priddy are the Lamb Leer Cavern and Wurt Pit and Devil's Punchbowl SSSIs.  Landmarks = Clock Tower  Clock Tower An interesting and unusual clock can be seen in the centre of the village. It was a gift of Mr W.W. Kettlewell, and was erected in 1897 to commemorate the 60-year reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria. Squared, irregular coursed rock- faced sandstone with stone dressings, plain tile roof and wooden bargeboards. Commemoration tablet beneath circular clock face set in chamfered stone surround with the inscription: 'TIME FLIES DONT DELAY' - each word in separate spandrels. Bargeboarded gable and has the wording 'HEAVEN'S LIGHT OUR GUIDE'. Set in prominent position at street junction. A Grade II listed building.  Richmont Castle  The scanty ruins of Richmont Castle are about southeast of the village church. The castle was besieged in 1138 when King Stephen captured it from Sir William de Harptree, a supporter of Queen Matilda's cause in the civil war between the king and queen. The castle was also visited by King John in 1205. The castle was demolished by its owner, Sir John Newton, in the reign of Henry VIII to build a house nearby called Eastwood.H. T. Ellacombe, 'Barre's Court, or Hannam' (London, 1869), p. 34. Wade and Wade in their 1929 book Somerset described it; \\"On an inaccessible tongue of land at the far end of the gorge are the remains of Richmont Castle, one of those lawless strongholds which in the days of Stephen were a terror to the country side. In 1138 it was strongly garrisoned by its owner, William de Harptree, on behalf of the Empress Matilda, but was taken by Stephen by the ruse of a feigned repulse. Now, only a fragment of the keep overlooks the glen.\\" By the 1540s the castle was described as ruinous.  Harptree Court  Grade II listed building Harptree Court was probably built in the late 18th century. It has a Greek Doric four-column portico probably added around 1820.  Eastwood Manor and farm Eastwood Manor is a Grade II listed house built in 1871. The neighbouring farm includes Eastwood Manor Farm Steading which is a Grade I listed building built in 1860.  Religious sites  Stile in St Lawrence churchyard Following his death in 1568 Sir John's huge, canopied tomb stands in the Norman porch of the Church of St Lawrence, which itself is a Grade II* listed building, parts of which date from the 12th century.

He was also known as J. Seward Johnson Sr. and Seward Johnson. He founded the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution (HBOI), and was the grandfather of Jamie Johnson, who directed the documentary Born Rich. Early life He was born on July 14, 1895 in New Brunswick, New Jersey, to Robert Wood Johnson I and Evangeline Brewster Armstrong. He had three siblings: Roberta Johnson, Robert Wood Johnson II, and Evangeline Johnson. Personal life Johnson's first marriage was to Ruth Dill, the sister of actress Diana Dill. They had four children: Mary Lea Johnson Richards, Elaine Johnson, John Seward Johnson II, and Diana Melville Johnson Firestone.People Archives It was alleged that Johnson would later sexually abuse his eldest daughter from age nine to fifteen.\\"The Battle of Bendel's: Crazier Than You and Me\\", New York Magazine, p. 129 (accessed October 9, 2010): \\"For six years, he committed incest with Mary Lea....\\" \\"Mary Lea Johnson was a victim of incest...\\" \\"She did anything that men wanted,\\" Richards says, sadly, \\"because of the abuse with her father.\\" In 1939, Johnson married Esther Underwood. They had two children: Jennifer Underwood Johnson and James Loring Johnson. During his thirty-two year marriage, he engaged in extramarital affairs with his chambermaid Barbara Piasecka. In 1971, they married with none of Johnson's children in attendance. Piasecka Johnson \\"often physically and emotionally abused her husband\\", trial adversaries said.Kristin McMurran, \\"The Band-Aid Heir Left All He Owned to His Widow, but His Children Claim It Was Just Seward's Folly\\", People, May 26, 1986.\\"Jury gets two views of widow\\", Boca Raton News, February 28, 1986, p. 2A.Samuel Maull, \\"Lawyers' speeches portray Johnson widow as shrew\\", The Telegraph February 28, 1986, p. 233. He signed his final will on April 14, 1983, leaving the bulk of his fortune to her. In that year, Johnson died of cancer at the age of 87. In accordance with the terms of the will, she received $402,824,971.59. The exclusion of the rest of his family from the will led to at least three highly publicized legal battles. In the Johnson v. Johnson court case, his six children from his first two marriages sued on grounds that he wasn't mentally competent at the time he signed the will. It was settled out of court, and the children were granted about 12% of the fortune.

It was founded by leaders of Jewish student groups across the country in January 2004 in Ottawa and became defunct in 2011. The CFJS Executive was made up of an elected President and four Vice- Presidents as well as a number of Committee Chairs and 'Members at Large' chosen by the elected portion of the executive. Elections were conducted on a proportional basis, with each university's campus being allotted 1 vote for every 500 Jewish students studying there, to a maximum of 5. CFJS was governed in part by a Congress, with representatives chosen by Jewish students at each university. History The Canadian Federation of Jewish Students was founded by the leaders of Jewish student groups across the country in January 2004 and exists to empower the Canadian Jewish student community. Since its founding, the CFJS has gained national recognition, most notably holding major national conferences from across Canada. CFJS has been noted for hosting an annual conference of Canadian Jewish leadership (Hillel and Jewish Students Association (JSA) presidents, Israel advocates, Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity leaders, et cetera). In the early years of CFJS, this conference was held at a camp in Parry Sound, Ontario. However, more recently, its annual conference has been moved to Guelph, Ontario.http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=17907&Itemid;=101 In September 2008, CFJS partnered with several other Jewish organization to send approximately 300 students to New York to protest \\"incitement to genocide\\" by Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was speaking that week at the United Nations.http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=15435&Itemid;=101 In the spring of 2009, CFJS assembled its congress - representatives of the major Jewish organizations from each Canadian campus - in Toronto, for leadership development, and elections of the CFJS executive. Speakers at the Congress included Jason Kenney, Canada's Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism.http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=16853&Itemid;=101 In early 2010, CFJS launched Milim, a publication devoted Canadian Jewish student art and literature.http://www.milim.ca/About.html Principles All of the organization's activities are based on the following five principles: Representation and Student Voice *CFJS helps to connect Jewish students on local campuses across Canada to both the Jewish and non-Jewish communities in Canada, Israel, and the world. CFJS takes its lead from the diverse and numerous Jewish groups on campus, advocating for students and helping their voices be heard. Convening and Uniting *CFJS helps to connect students from Victoria to London, Winnipeg to Halifax, and to physically bring them together to see and feel the common bond they share with their fellow Jewish students across the country. Leadership Development *CFJS works to identify and cultivate the diverse qualities of students, in order to help the Jewish student community in Canada continue to thrive and to shape tomorrow and today. Canadian Jewish Identity Development *CFJS believes students can take pride in their freedoms, and works to promote, develop, and defend this pride. It encourages students to explore and express their own Jewish identity and connection to Israel while cherishing Canadian ideals and values. National Communication *CFJS helps to facilitate communication between students on a local, regional, and national level and to establish a network among them. CFJS enables individuals to share resources, ideas and best practices with other Jewish students in all parts of the country. Representation CFJS strives to represent Jewish students and their concerns and interests to outside organizations, including but not limited to national Jewish and student organizations as well as international Jewish student organizations and in the news media. This representation exists through the consent and support of local campus-based Jewish student groups.http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=17907&Itemid;=101 2010-2011 Elected Executive * President: Aaron Vomberg, Dalhousie University * VP Internal: Rebecca Cherniak, McMaster University * VP External: Paige MacPherson, Dalhousie University * VP Programming: Shira Fenyes, University of Saskatchewan * VP Finance: Allie Novack, McGill University * Immediate Past President: Samantha Banks, Concordia University 2010-2011 Board * Graduate Student Chair: Noah Kadish, York University * Graduate Student Chair: Matt Rutchik, University of Toronto * Communication Chair: Ashley Faintuch, University of Winnipeg * Tzedec & Jewish Identity Chair: Maddie Axelrod, Queen's University * Tzedec & Jewish Identity Chair: Adam Moscoe, University of Ottawa * Campaigns Chair: Allie Cuperfain, University of Toronto * Campaigns Chair: Jeff Greenberg, University of Guelph * Advisory: Moishie Kahan, Universit√© de Montr√©al, Noah Kochman University of Ottawa CFJS also has representation on the following bodies: * CIJA - The Canadian Council for Jewish and Israel Advocacy * NJCL - National Jewish Campus Life * CIC - Canada-Israel Committee * UIA Federations Canada * Hillel International * World Union of Jewish Students External links * Canadian Federation of Jewish Students Notes=References Category:Jewish youth organizations Category:Zionism in Canada Category:Students' associations in Canada ","title":"Canadian Federation of Jewish Students"},{"id":"3812366","text":"The Great Outdoors is a 1988 American comedy film directed by Howard Deutch, and written and produced by John Hughes. It stars Dan Aykroyd, John Candy, Stephanie Faracy and Annette Bening in her film debut. The film follows two families spending time on vacation in Wisconsin. Plot Chicagoan Chester \\"Chet\\" Ripley (John Candy), his wife, Connie (Stephanie Faracy), and their two sons, Buckley \\"Buck\\" and Ben, are on vacation at a lake resort in Pechoggin, Wisconsin during the summer. All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate (Annette Bening), her investment broker husband, Roman Craig (Dan Aykroyd), and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories after the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear (Bart the Bear). When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from that day on, it was known as the \\"Bald-Headed Bear\\" of Clare County. After Roman pulls Chet around the lake on an impromptu water ski ride with his rented speedboat, tensions between the families erupt. Chet is ready to pack up and go home, even as his teenage son Buck tries to romance a local girl, Cammie. The budding romance goes well until Chet is challenged to eat the Old 96'er (a 96-ounce steak) at a family dinner which causes Buck to break their date. Buck tries to apologize to Cammie for being late, but Cammie refuses to speak to him. Connie and Kate bond at a local bar when the conversation drifts to Kate's challenges of being wealthy. Later, just at the peak of tension between families, it emerges that Roman has made a bad investment and is broke. He has not told Kate and was planning to hit up Chet for the cash. Later, during a thunderstorm, the twins wander off and fall into a mine shaft. Chet and Roman find them, but the claustrophobic Roman is reluctant to descend into the tiny mine shaft. After some encouragement from Chet, Roman summons up all his courage, while Chet goes in search of a rope to pull them out. Upon realizing that the mine is stocked with old dynamite, Roman takes his daughters and climbs out of the shaft on his own. When Chet returns with the rope, he is horrified to discover the \\"Bald-Headed Bear\\" lurking in the mine. It chases him back to his house, smashes through the door, and rampages through the house. Wally, the cabin owner, bursts in with a loaded shotgun while Roman tries to hold off the animal with a fireplace poker and an oar. Chet takes the gun and shoots the bear, blowing the fur off its rear. Roaring in pain, the bear runs out of the house. The next morning, the two families part on good terms. Unbeknownst to Chet, Connie has invited Roman's family to stay with them until they can get back on their feet. Cammie and Buck make up and end their summer romance, as Buck and his family head back to Chicago. In a post-credits scene, a family of raccoons (who rummaged through the trash cans throughout the film) discover the bear sitting in the lake out of embarrassment due to being \\"bald on both ends\\".

Ducey's Bass Lake Lodge, a rustic 1940s resort in Bass Lake, was featured as Wally and Juanita's Perk's Pine Lodge. The Loon's Nest vacation cabin, built on the backlot at Universal Studios,http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/fallslake_logcabin.shtml was designed to match the style of Ducey's existing cabins. Reception The Great Outdoors earned a mixed response from critics. Janet Maslin of The New York Times reported that the film did not have enough collective energy to light a campfire in her review. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called the film as \\"a crass, blah comedy about summer vacation perils\\" and said he was surprised the film got made at all. He described the end credits sequence where Aykroyd and Candy dance to Wilson Pickett's \\"Land of a Thousand Dances\\" as the only genuine fun and energy in the entire film. \\"Imagine that it's raining cats and dogs and you're locked in a north woods cabin for weeks with the people you like least, and you'll pretty much have a feel for what it's like to sit through this movie,\\" said Hal Hinson of The Washington Post. Box office The film grossed $6,121,115 in its opening weekend and ended up with a North American domestic box office gross of $41,455,230, and a worldwide gross of $43,455,230. Soundtrack A soundtrack for the film was released by Atlantic Records in 1988 and featured many of the songs used in the film. Reboot On April 27, 2017, Universal Pictures has Kevin Hart, Nia Long, Yara Shahidi, China Anne McClain and Shawn Kavanaugh starring in a reboot of the film, with Michael De Luca producing.

Even though representative fossils have only been found throughout Asia and North America, the range of Therizinosauridae is believed to have spanned much of the supercontinent of Laurasia based on several footprints and isolated remains on Europe and Africa. Therizinosauridae compromises currently seven described and named taxa. Therizinosauridae was named in 1954 by the Evgeny Maleev after the large, claw-bearing unguals of the type species Therizinosaurus cheloniformis. Therizinosaurids were generally large and very robustly built animals that had a near convergent body plan with the more recent (and also extinct) ground sloths. The largest genera of the group are Therizinosaurus and Segnosaurus, which were about and long, respectively. The physiology of therizinosaurids include a broad and rounded belly supported by a wide and robust pelvis with thick hind-limbs composed of very sout, four-toed feet, a strong arm build with enhanced hand flexibility, elongated hand claws, and a highly derived, nearly avian inner- ear. Traits that are also well-known include an elongated neck, a prominent keratinous beak and a prosauropod-like dentition that differs from all theropods. In addition, therizinosaurids are estimated to have had more advanced feathers in comparison to primitive therizinosaurs (Beipiaosaurus or Jianchangosaurus). The unique and bizarre features of group has encourage research into the paleobiology and paleoecology of the family. A fair portion of modern research has concentrated on the feeding-patterns of these dinosaurs, as they are considered to be the best regarded theropod canditates for herbivory. While other theropod groups are fully carnivorous, members of Therizinosauridae diverged and adopted an herbivorous and possibly omnivorous lifestyle. This is even more supported by their unusual morphology. As indicated by their feet morphology and several footprints from Asia, Africa and Europe, they probably were plantigrade walkers, but further examination may be required. Therizinosaurids were oviparous animals that nested in colonies and laid egg clutches. In fact, therizinosaur eggs are particularly common on Late Cretaceous formations, mainly in Asia. The oofamily Dendroolithidae is often attributed to therizinosaur-grade dinosaurs. Some of the first dendroolithid eggs were found on the Bayan Shireh and Nanchao formations. Their relationships were confusing and obscure on the early years of research mainly because of the unusual traits among members. Several alternative classifications were proposed (such as the naming of Segnosauridae in 1979) until more complete specimens and other taxa were described during the 1990s, which confirmed them as theropods. Many of the shared characters within the group also showed that Segnosauridae was a junior synonym of the much earlier family Therizinosauridae. The current phylogenetic consensus is that therizinosaurids evolved from small, bird-like maniraptorans, and thus they fall within the coelurosaurian clade called Maniraptora. Moreover, most of the traits of therizinosaurids (such as the ear structure) were inherited by smaller, agile, carnivorous ancestors. Extensive phylogenetic analyses have concluded that within Maniraptora, therizinosaurs were the first of five major groups to diverge. History of discovery Holotype claw cast of Therizinosaurus (PIN 551‚Äì483) The first definitive therizinosaurid discovered was Therizinosaurus. The fossil remains were discovered in 1918 during Mongolian field expedition on the Nemegt Formation of the Gobi Desert. Several claws were unearthed by the team and later described by the Soviet paleontologist Evgeny Maleev in 1954. The claws were unusually large, approximately long if restored, very straight and flattened. Maleev considered that the claws belonged to a giant marine turtle and named the new genus and species Therizinosaurus cheloniformis, also erecting the Therizinosauridae to include the new species. Translated paper In the 1970s more findings were made including the naming of more taxa. Additional specimens of Therizinosaurus were referred by the Mongolian paleontologist Rinchen Barsbold in 1976. He described a set of partial arms from the Nemegt Formation and given the similarities within the claws, he referred this specimen to the genus. The Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle described and named the new genus Segnosaurus in 1979, based on lower jaws and much of the hindlimbs. He also coined the newer Segnosauridae (now synonym of Therizinosauridae) to contain this species. Translated paper In the same year, paleontologist Dong Zhiming described the genus Nanshiungosaurus, but wrongly interpreted the remains to have pertained to some kind of dwarf sauropod. Translated paper In the following year, Barsbold and Perle coined the family Segnosauria (now Therizinosauria) to contain the Segnosauridae and kin. Also, they named and briefly described Erlikosaurus, a new genus smaller than Segnosaurus. Confusingly, Perle redescribed Erlikosaurus treating the taxon as a new genus and species in 1981. Translated paper Also, Perle described another specimen of Therizinosaurus in 1982, this time a partial hind limb. He referred the hindlimd to the genus based on the similarities with Segnosaurus. Translated paper In 2001, the new therizinosaurids Neimongosaurus and Nothronychus (N. mckinleyi) were described and named, and in the following year Erliansaurus was also described and named. Although a new species of Nothronychus (N. graffami) was named in 2009. With this, both species make Nothronychus the most complete therizinosaurid known. Description Size comparison between the genera of the Therizinosauridae Therizinosaurids were quite advanced and robustly-built animals that reached multi-ton dimensions which make them among the largest maniraptorans. The smallest known therizinosaurids are Erliansaurus, Erlikosaurus and Neimongosaurus which were around long, furthermore the holotype skull of Erlikosaurus is about . Segnosaurus and the possible therizinosaurid Suzhousaurus were about the same size, in length and weighing . Slightly smaller members are represented by Nanshiungosaurus and Nothronychus, estimated at long and in weight, respectively. Genus List for Holtz 2012 Weight Information The related \\"Nanshiungosaurus\\" bohlini was similar in size (about long), however, its assignment to Nanshiungosaurus is unlikely and it may or not represent another species or specimen of the better known Suzhousaurus. Therizinosaurus were the largest representatives, reaching the top dimensions of the group, they grew up to long weighing over . These dimensions that make the genus among the largest-known theropods. The exponential sizes obtained across the Therizinosauridae appear to have been triggered by the bulk and specialized diet within the group and early members of the Therizinosauria. Skin impressions from Beipiaosaurus and Jianchangosaurus indicate that primitive therizinosaurs were covered with a coat of down-like, sparse feathers similar to those seen in the compsognathid Sinosauropteryx, as well as longer, simpler, quill-like feathers that may have been used in display. However, while the earliest known example of primitive, stage-I feathers are found among early therizinosaurs, more advanced members are thought to have possessed more developed, avian-like feathers. Although typically associated with flight, the feathers which covered these animals were not used for that purpose, instead, they assisted in either metabolism or display. Crania Therizinosaurids had more specialized skulls compared to primitive members such as Falcarius, which had a generalist, beak-less snout. They had relatively elongated snouts and the tip was covered with a rhamphotheca (keratinous beak) used during feeding. Although the extension of the beak on the dorsal surface of the snout is unknown, it is estimated that it slightly overlapped the nasal cavity as in some modern-day birds. The dentary (lower jaw) also developed a rhamphotheca, seen on the edentulous (without teeth) anterior-most end. This extension was supplied by neurovascular foramina (small pits) found on the lateral surfaces. The known specimens of the therizinosaurids Erlikosaurus, Neimongosaurus and Segnosaurus preserve numerous neurovascular foramina (more notorious on Erlikosaurus), indicating that a well-developed beak was present in life. Both maxilla and premaxilla were toothed and some species of therizinosaurids had specialized, recurved dentaries such as Segnosaurus and possibly Neimongosaurus. Braincases are known from three therizinosaurids: Erlikosaurus, Neimongosaurus and N. mckinleyi. Unfortunately, the braincase of Neimongosaurus has not been described nor illustrated. The braincases are directed to the bottom, co- ossified with well-developed sideways oriented paroccipital projections, highly pneumatized and had a prominent central foramen. Much of the nerves and canals can be traced on the respective specimens of Erlikosaurus and Nothronychus, allowing the rendering of 3D endrocranial casts. The dentition is another featured trait in therizinosaurids which differs from all theropod groups. At least two different tooth morphologies are observed among therizinosaurids; the first is represented by relatively homodont, oval to lanceolate-shaped teeth with moderate coarse denticles (serrations) on the crowns (upper exposed part). This type of dentition is better represented by the complete, three-dimensional holotype skull of Erlikosaurus which features the mentioned characters. Two isolated teeth are known from the therizinosaurids Nothronychus and they are lanceolate-shaped, symmetrical, have moderate denticles, and strongly resemble those of Erlikosaurus. Furthermore, they seem to derive from the dentary based on comparisons with Erlikosaurus. The preserved holotype dentary tip of Neimongosaurus preserves an erupted tooth that is lanceolate-shaped with small coarse serrations, falling within this type of dentition. Another type of dental morphology is the one seen on the highly specialized Segnosaurus. In this taxon, the teeth are very heterodont, leaf-shaped with relatively less denticles that are prominently developed being bigger than in the previous therizinosaurids. These denticles are composed of numerous folded carinae (cutting edges) with denticulated front edges, creating a roughened and shredding surface near the base of the tooth crowns. Most therizinosaurids appear to have had a low tooth replacement rate or not able to loose them at all. Postcranial skeleton Frontal view of the arms in Therizinosaurus IGM 100/15 In therizinosaurids, the shoulder girdle was robustly specialized than in other maniraptorans and less bird-like. The scapula (shoulder blade) was very straight and flattened at the upper end being fused to the coracoid bone, forming the scapulocoracoid. Near the region of the scapulocoracoid suture, on the coracoid, a large foramen is present. The coracoid is a wide and broad element that is slightly convex and thickened near of the scapulocoracoid suture. The humerus (upper arm) was exceptionally robust and flexible with wide lower ends as seen on the humeri of the therizinosaurids Nothronychus and Therizinosaurus. Not only that but the biceps muscle was prominently well- developed in Therizinosaurus. In Segnosaurus, the deltopectoral crest (deltoid muscle attachment) was strongly built. The antebrachium was relatively straight in most members, particularly on Therizinosaurus. The reduced carpal block on therizinosaurids enabled an enhanced hand flexion. Manual phalanges are relatively standard in shape among maniraptorans with a formula of digits I, II and III. However, a new and as-yet unnamed therizinosaurid specimen from the Bayan Shireh Formation preserves a reduced third digit that is almost vestigial on both hands. The other two digits are regular in constitution indicating that this species had indeed, a functionally didactyl hand like some tyrannosaurids, which makes it to differ from all other known therizinosaurs. Photographs Right foot of Nothronychus graffami The manual unguals (claws) are proportionally larger than the phalanges, strongly flattened from side to side, and recurved with more degrees of specialization than therizinosauroids. Most therizinosaurids had sharply pointed and recurved unguals with very robust tubercles (flexor tendons attachment). These traits are better seen on Nothronychus and Segnosaurus. In Therizinosaurus, however, the manual unguals were extremely elongated and straight with poor curves. Although most of them are incomplete, if restored, they would measure about long, which make them the largest hand claws of any known terrestrial animal. The tubercles are not as strongly developed as in other therizinosaurids though, in addition, Therizinosaurus had some of the longest forelimbs known for any bipedal dinosaurs: the preserved right arm in specimen IGM 100/15 has a total length of . The vertebral column was highly pneumatized (air-spaced) and is relatively well documented from several badly to well-preserved elements among genera but specimens of Nanshiungosaurus and Nothronychus preserve the most complete series of vertebrae. Therizinosaurids had large and robust cervical vertebrae with relatively short neural spines and platycoelous (concave at both ends) to opisthocoelus (concave posterior ends) centra that were elongated and had some degree of pneumacity. In dorsal vertebrae the neural spines are more elongated and stiff. Several pneumatopores (small openings leading to air pockets) are present on the dorsolateral surfaces of the centra and they proggressively reduce in size. Some species like N. graffami had a narrow hump-like structure on their back as indicated by the very elongated neural spines of the first dorsals. In therizinosaurids, the sacrum was composed by about six sacral vertebrae with broad centra that have rounded facets. The caudal vertebrae were stocky with stiff and rounded transverse projections. When compared to early members, therizinosaurids had a reduction in the number of caudals and a minor chevron constriction, which indicates a shorter and flexible tail. Pelvis of Nothronychus graffami Therizinosaurids had wide torsos supported by a broad, sloth-like pelvis. The ribcage was very round and composed by elongated ribs with fairly robust capitula. The most modified element within the therizinosaurid build was the possession of a unique opisthopubic pelvis (pubis and ischium extending backwards), a feature known otherwise only in birds and ornithischians. The ilium was larger than the ischium and pubis, having very deflected and pronounced iliac blades. The prominent extension of the ilium shows that therizinosaurids had massive thighs. On the bottom of the ischium, a large obturator process (ridge-like expansion) was present, most notably in Segnosaurus and Nothronychus. The pubis was larger than the ischium and had a large pubic boot (wide expansion at the end). Unlike any other theropod group, the pubis and ischium were attached together forming a solid structure with a square end. Both femur and tibia were robust in constitution. The former was relatively straight with well-developed articulations and femoral head. The tibia was slightly shorter than the femur and had a wide lower end, forming a prominent ankle. The fibula was pinched to the bottom and very stiffened. Both astragalus and calcaneum were generally robust and elongated bones but the astragalar body was apparently reduced in this group. The astragalus has an elongated lateral condyle but the medial one is narrower. The lateral projection of the astragalus is thickened and extends to the midline of the whole element from the inner side to the rear, leading space for the lower end of the tibia; this exposes the lateral surface of the tibia in a frontal view. The calcaneum was larger and robust than most theropods. It has a rounded shape with concave articular surfaces and had a mobile articulation with the adjacent elements such as the astragalus or distal tarsals. Another highly modified element was the tetradactyl pes: the metatarsus was composed by four shortened, fully functionally metatarsals. Metatarsals III and IV were almost equal in size, the second was slightly narrow and the first one was the shortest. There are, however, traces of metatarsal V but it is highly reduced and has no functional significance‚àías seen on Segnosaurus. The phalangeal formula was as in other maniraptorans, IV-4, III-3, II-2 and I-1 (excluding the unguals). The pedal unguals were sharply pointed, side to side flattened and smaller than the manual unguals. In Erlikosaurus however, they are massive, combining a stiff and recurved shape with robust tubercles. Classification Segnosaurus holotype pelvis in lateral view and metatarsus in top view as in the original description by Perle The family Therizinosauridae was coined by Evgeny Maleev in 1954 to contain the enigmatic Therizinosaurus, who interpreted this taxon as representing giant marine turtles. Relatives of Therizinosaurus were later found but not recognized as such for some time. With the description of Segnosaurus in 1979, the paleontologist Altangerel Perle coined the family Segnosauridae to contain this enigmatic taxon and tentatively considered this group to represent theropods. He noted that this new family was different from Therizinosauridae based on claw and antebrachium traits. Moreover, in the same year Perle and Rinchen Barsbold analyzed the pelvis structure of Segnosaurus and concluded that it was unusually different from those of \\"traditional\\" theropods. Based on these observations, they proposed that segnosaurids should be separated into a separate grouping, near the level of the main division infraorder Saurischia. Translated paper Parallel to this, the newly and also described Nanshiungosaurus was assigned to the Titanosaurinae by Dong Zhiming based on the assumption it was a sauropod genus. In the following year, both Barsbold and Perle named the new theropod infraorder Segnosauria, containing the Segnosauridae. In this new paper they also described the new Erlikosaurus and Enigmosaurus (then unnamed) noting that segnosaurs were more similar to theropod dinosaurs and though some of their features resembled those of ornithischians and sauropods, these similarities were superficial and distinct when examined in detail. In 1982, Perle described a third specimen of the therizinosaurids Therizinosaurus. He referred this material to the genus based on the striking similarities with the specimens of Segnosaurus. Additionally, Perle acompared the forelimbs in these two taxa and concluded that they were characterized by elongated arms, possibly belonging to a single taxonomic group. However, based on osteological features, in 1984 Gregory S. Paul proposed that segnosaurs were no theropods but Late Cretaceous prosauropods and they represented a transitional form between prosauropods and ornithischians. For instance, segnosaurs resembled prosauropods in their skull and foot morphology and were also similar to ornithischians in their snout, pubis, and ankle. In 1988 he suggested a segnosaurian classification for the therizinosaurids Therizinosaurus. In a review article on the book The Dinosauria in 1990, Barsbold and Teresa Marya≈Ñska considered Segnosauria to be an enigmatic group of saurischians with a position subject to change. They however, disagreed with Therizinosaurus as a segnosaurian taxon since it was known from forelimb material; they corroborated the referred hindlimb material as segnosaurian though. Lastly, Barsbold and Marya≈Ñska noted the striking similarities between the pelvises of Nanshiungosaurus and Segnosaurus, such as the opisthopubic condition and large iliac blade. They concluded that the former was part of the Segnosauridae. Skeletal composite of two specimens of Alxasaurus With the description of the therizinosauroids Alxasaurus in 1993 by Dale A. Russell and Dong Zhiming, the affinities of the group were fairly more clear. This new taxon represented the most complete member and was known from multiple specimens with numerous theropod traits. Moreover, the preserved hindlimbs in some specimens showed that the assignment of segnosaurian hindlimbs to Therizinosaurus was correct and \\"segnosaurs\\" were in fact theropods. Russell and Dong also noted the extreme similarities between Therizinosauridae and Segnosauridae and considered that the latter was a synonym of the former due to priority. However, Alxasaurus was a fairly more primitive genus and the superfamily Therizinosauroidea was coined to contain it and related species. Posterior to this year, Clark and colleagues redescribed the holotype skull of Erlikosaurus and found more theropod traits than when first described. They concluded that therizinosaurs were more likely to be classified as maniraptoran theropods. Therizinosauria itself, was erected in 1997 by Rusell in order to contain all of these theropods. This new infraorder was composed of Therizinosauroidea and the more advanced Therizinosauridae. The family Therizinosauridae was first given a phylogenetic definition by Paul Sereno in 1998, who defined it as all dinosaurs closer to Erlikosaurus than to Ornithomimus. In 2010, Lindsay Zanno conducted the most detailed phylogenetic analysis of the Therizinosauria to that point. She cited the inaccessibility, damage, potential loss of holotype specimens, scarcity of cranial remains, and fragmentary specimens with few overlapping elements as the most significant obstacles to resolving the evolutionary relationships within the group. The position of Segnosaurus and those of some other Asian therizinosaurids was affected by these factors; Zanno stated more well- preserved specimens and the rediscovery of missing elements would be necessary. Zanno also revised Therizinosauroidea to exclude Falcarius and retained it in the wider clade Therizinosauria, which became the senior synonym of Segnosauria. In addition, she defined Therizinosauridae as the least inclusive clade containing Erlikosaurus, Nothronychus, Segnosaurus and Therizinosaurus. Falcarius and Jianchangosaurus are now regarded as the most primitive therizinosaurs while therizinosauroids are considered to be more derived that these two taxa, but less derived than therizinosaurids. Most phylogenetic analyses recover the family Therizinosauridae containing Erlikosaurus, Erliansaurus, Nanshiungosaurus, Neimongosaurus, Nothronychus, Segnosaurus and Therizinosaurus. However, Suzhousaurus is commonly recovered within the group. Therizinosauridae, along a handful of named genera, constitute the superfamily of Therizinosauroidea and finally, Therizinosauroidea falls within the higher infraorder of Therizinosauria. Although a consensus has yet to be reached, it has been proposed that therizinosaurs are the most primitive clade within Maniraptora, as well as the sister clade to oviraptorosaurs. The cladogram below follows the 2019 phylogenetic analysis by Scott Hartman and colleagues, which is largely based on the work from Zanno in 2010. While most therizinosaurids are recovered in relatively traditional, well-established positions, the therizinosauroid \\"N.\\" bohlini was unusually recovered as a therizinosaurid taxon: Skeletal composite of various therizinosaurs (not to scale) Paleobiology=Feeding Lower jaws of Erlikosaurus (bottom) and Segnosaurus (top) compared In 2009, Zanno and colleagues stated therizinosaurs were the most-widely regarded candidates for herbivory among theropods based on the small, densely packed, coarse serrations; lance-shaped teeth with a relatively low replacement rate; a well- developed keratinous beak; long neck for browsing; relatively small skulls; a very large gut capacity as indicated by the rib circumference at the trunk and the outwards flaring processes of the ilia; and the notable lack of cursorial adaptations in the hind limbs. All of these features suggest that members of this family feed on vegetation, as well as pre-processing it within their mouths to begin the breakdown of cellulose and lignin. This is perhaps even more so true for therizinosaurids, which seem to have further exploited these characters. One of the most notable adaptations in advanced therizinosaurids are the four-toed feet, which had a fully functional, weight-bearing first digit that was likely adapted to slow life-style. Zanno and colleagues found that Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, and Oviraptorosauria had either direct or morphological evidence for herbivory, which would mean either this diet evolved independently multiple times in coelurosaurian theropods or that the primitive condition of the group was at least facultative herbivory with carnivory only emerging in more derived maniraptorans. The skull of therizinosaurids was specialized as well, as it was likely capped off with a beak-like rostrum in the front. It has been argued that this rostrum was likely covered with a keratinous beak, an adaption that might have helped to enhance cranial stability by mitigating the stress and strain experienced by the skull during feeding. As indicated by their respective dental morphologies, the contemporaneous therizinosaurids Erlikosaurus and Segnosaurus were separated by niche partitioning. These differentiations include the relatively indistinct and symmetrical teeth with moderate serrations (denticles) in Erlikosaurus, and the enlarged serrations in Segnosaurus composed of additional carinae and folded carinae with denticulated front edges, which together created a roughened, shredding surface near the base of the tooth crowns that was apparently unique to Segnosaurus and suggest they consumed unique food resources or used highly specialized feeding strategies, and had a higher degree of oral food processing than other therizinosaurids. In addition to these morphological differences, in 2019 Button and Zanno note that herbivorous dinosaurs followed two main distinct modes of feeding. One of these was processing food in the gut which is characterized by gracile skulls and relatively low bite forces. The second was oral food processing, characterized by features associated with extensive processing such as the lower jaws or dentition. Segnosaurus was found to be in the former mode, whereas Erlikosaurus was more likely to fall in the second group, indicating these two therizinosaurids were functionally separated and occupied different niches. During the same year, Ali Nabavizadeh concluded that most therizinosaurs were mainly orthal feeders (moving their jaws up and down and not to the sides) and raised their jaws isognathously whereby the upper and lower teeth of each side contacted each other at once. However, advanced Late Cretaceous therizinosaurids had relatively weak bite forces compared to primitive therizinosaurs. In 2013 the paleontologist Stephan Lautenschlager performed digital reconstructions for the cranial musculature in Erlikosaurus and found the bite force of Edmontosaurus being greater than that for the former. The lesser bite force for Erlikosaurus better served in stripping and cropping leaves, rather than active mastication. On a newer study with more therizinosaur taxa, Lautenschlager found similar conclusions. The evolutionary trends in jaw mechanics of therizinosaurs noticed a change in bite force through time, from higher bite forces in early members to lesser ones in the advanced therizinosaurids. Therizinosaurids were aided by the down-turned tip and symphyseal regions (union between bones) of the dentaries, and probably also by beaks. By contrast, the straighter and more elongated dentaries of primitive therizinosaurs had the highest magnitudes of stress and strain. A downwards- pulling motion of the head while gripping vegetation was more likely than a sideways or upwards movement, though such behavior would be more likely in therizinosaurids with their stress-mitigating jaws. Foraging Skeletal mount of Nothronychus featuring prominent arms and claws Among therizinosaurids, the forelimbs were increased in robustness and the flexibility of the wrist was increased as well, with this, the presumed reach for foraging is likely to have lengthened. Moreover, the pectoral girdle has been modified to further augment upright reach, however the grasping ability of the animals is thought to have decreased. These adaptations are more linked to assist with their herbivorous lifestyle, as they have specialized the ability to harvest and collect vegetation. Moreover. in the therizinosaurids Neimongosaurus, the range of motion in the arms was roughly circular at the glenoid-humeral joint at the shoulder, and directed sideways and slightly downwards, which diverged from the more oval, backwards-and-downwards-directed ranges of other theropods. This ability to extend their arms considerably forwards may have helped these therizinosaurids reach and grasp for foliage. In 2014, Lautenschlager tested the biomechanical function of multiple therizinosaur claws. He noted that the hands of some therizinosaurids (such as Nothronyhus or Therizinosaurus) were more effective when piercong or pulling down vegetation. The arms would have had to be able to extend the range of the animal to a point that could not be reached by the head if they were used for browsing and pulling down vegetation. In genera where both neck and forelimb elements are preserved, however, the necks were equal in length or longer than the forelimbs, so pulling vegetation would only be likely if lower parts of long branches were pulled down to access out-of-reach vegetation. Lautenschlager also found that therizinosaurid claws would not have been used for digging, which would have been done with the foot claws because, since as in other maniraptorans, feathers on the forelimbs would have interfered with this function. Additionally, this action leads to a higher stress tension on the dorsal area of the claw‚àíthis is more evident in Therizinosaurus. However, he could neither confirm nor disregard that the hand claws could have been fully used for sexual display, self-defense, intraspecific competition, mate- gripping during mating or grasping stabilization when foraging. Brain and senses The group is also notable for adaptations to the structures of their ear. The structure of their inner-ear is almost avian, with bird-like semicircular canals and an extended cochlea. For birds, an extended cochlea allows them to hear across an increased range of frequencies, suggesting a similar function in the ponderous therizinosaurids and also allowing them a good hearing and balance, which indeed, are traits better associated with carnivorous theropods. Furthermore, the lengthening of the cochlea, an adaptation which has independently evolved in a number of other theropod groups, is thought to further improve auditory acumen. The forebrain of therizinosaurids was fairly enlarged and developed with elongated olfactory bulbs. The adaptations to the inner-ear and forebrain of therizinosaurids likely served a number of functions, such as well-developed senses of smell, complex social behavior, increased alertness to the vocalizations of juveniles or even communicating with conspecifics, moreover, the large pneumatic chambers on the sensorial areas in the skulls of therizinosaurids (Erlikosaurus or Nothronychus mckinleyi) indicates that the tympanic systems would result in increased and optimal low frequency sound reception, possibly infrasound. Such is the case of N. mckinleyi, which had an average hearing frequency of 1100 to 1450 Hz and possible upper limits between 3000 and 3700 Hz. Features include not only extensive basicranial pneumaticity, but also the development of a basisphenoid bulla (hollow bony structure). In addition, the orientation of the horizontal semicircular canal relative to the horizontal orientation of the occipital condyle gave therizinosaurids a horizontal head posture that enabled binocular vision with overlapping visual fields. A vast majority of these senses were also well-developed in earlier coelurosaurs and other theropods, indicating that therizinosaurids inherited many of these traits from their small, carnivorous maniraptoran ancestors and retained the ancestral, carnivorous ear configuration to be used for their different and very specialized dietary purposes. Locomotion Footprint of DMNH 2010-07-01 compared to the foot of Erlikosaurus In 1964, Zakharov described and named the particular ichnogenus Macropodosaurus, which is represented by a series of four-toed footprints. These tracks were found in beds of the Cenomanian age at Tajikistan, noting that they were made by a bipedal four- toed dinosaur and the toes were webbed or at least, very fleshy. It is unlikely that these were made by a quadrupedal animal since no manual footprints were found in association. The footprints are about long and wide. Since the research of therizinosaurs started posterior to these findings, Zakharov was not able to determine the exact type of dinosaur. Sennikov in 2006 re-examined these footprints and concluded that a therizinosaurid-grade dinosaur could have made those tracks. He compared Macropodosaurus with the articulated feet of Erlikosaurus and the referred one from Therizinosaurus revealing that when articulated in a plantigrade position they fit in the morphology of Macropodosaurus. Therefore, he considered these tracks to be more associated with therizinosaurids and was one of the first in propose a plantigrade stance in therizinosaurids. An additional Macropodosaurus-grade footprint was discovered in Poland and first reported in 2008. This footprint is reminiscent of the tracks described by Zakharov and therefore assigned to Macropodosaurus sp. These tracks could indicate the presence of therizinosaurs in Europe. In 2017 Masrour with colleagues reported Macropodosaurus footprints in what is now Morocco. They are similar to the original description with some degree of semiplantigradism. However, several other footprints may indicate a more digitigrade stance. Such is the case the footprints from the Cantwell Formation labelled under the numbers DMNH 2010-07-01, 2013-08-04, 2013-08-06 and 2014-11-05. These impressions are composed by four toes with the first digit slightly smaller than the others which is attributed to therizinosaurids. At least one footprint, DMNH 2010-07-01, was directly compared to the relatively complete right pes of Erlikosaurus revealing a consistent morphology. However, most of the footprint was made (apparently) by the fingers and a foot pad, indicating a more upright position of the metatarsals. Nevertheless, Botelho and colleagues have also considered a plantigrade stance for therizinosaurids in 2016. Accordingly, members of the Therizinosauridae (such as Neimongosaurus or Nothronychus) re-evolved a fully functional first digit that articulates to the ankle. ReproductionNesting= Some of the first dendroolithid eggs‚Äîwhich are attributed to therizinosaurs‚Äîwere reported from the Bayan Shireh and Nanchao formations on the same year, 1997. These consisted of several egg clutches (a group) with an average composition of 7 or more eggs. In addition, the Bayan Shireh Formation has produced fully grown, specific therizinosaurid taxa, such as Erlikosaurus and Segnosaurus. The egg nests from the Nanchao Formation remained undescribed for several years, only being briefly examined but identified to contain fossilized embryos. However, in 2007 these were described by paleontologist Martin Kundr√°t and colleagues and tentatively identified as therizinosaurids based on anatomical features such as the tooth-less premaxilla with a downturned edge, dentary with a lateral shelf, teeth with leaf-shaped crowns, humerus with a prominent deltopectoral crest, ilium with an expanded anterior end, and the elongated, sharply-pointed manual unguals. Most eggs have an average size of and given these dimensions, they likely were laid by a medium- sized female. Although several egg clutches were found, one was found containing 7 eggs of which 3 of them were preserving the embryos. In 2019, Hartman and colleagues were the first authors to include these embryos in a phylogenetic analysis and as expected, the embryos were recovered as therizinosaurids. In a 2013 conference abstract, paleontologist Yoshitsugu Kobayashi and colleagues reported an exceptional nesting ground site of theropod dinosaurs at the Javkhlant Formation, which contained at least 17 egg clutches from the same layer within an area of 22 m by 52 m. Each clutch contained spherical eggs which were in contact with each other and arranged in a circular structure without a central opening. Based on microscopical features in the eggshells, they identified the eggs as dendroolithids, which had previously been attributed to therizinosaur-grade dinosaurs. The multiple clutches indicate that some therizinosaurids were colonial nesters and the fact that they were found in a single stratigraphic layer suggests that they nested at the site on a single occasion and therefore did not exhibit philopatric behaviour. This nesting site was formally described in 2019 by Kohei Tanaka and colleagues. In this comprehensive description, the amount of egg clutches was corrected to at least 15, noting that the eggs were laid in clutches composed of 3 to 30 eggs and hatched in the same single nesting season. The eggs have an average diameter of with some variations between and . Based on the smooth outer surface, both inner and outer portions, and several irregular-shaped pore canals of these eggs, they were corroborated to pertain to the Dendroolithidae. Approximately the 50% of the nesting area has been eroded, and based on the egg clutches distribution, the nest density can be estimated around 1 nest per 10 m2. This indicates that up to 32 nests were originally present. The habitat that the parents nested in was a semi-arid flood plain and the egg clutches were covered in organic-rich material during incubation as some extant archosaurs do today (crocodiles and megapode birds). In addition, the egg-shell fragments association indicates that many of the clutches hatched before the site was buried by a flood event. Out of a total of 15 clutches, at least 9 successfully hatched, which represents a nesting success rate of at least 60% for the entire site. The prominent nesting site of the Javkhlant Formation indicates that colonial nesting first evolved in non-avian dinosaur species to increase hatching success in ecosystems subject to high nest predation pressure (such as this formation). Lastly, though dendroolithid eggs are also attributed to megalosauroids, and therizinosaurids are not known from the Javkhlant Formation, it overlies the Bayan Shireh Formation, where other dendroolithid eggs and the therizinosaurs Enigmosaurus, Erlikosaurus and Segnosaurus were found. Moreover, the absence of megalosauroids on these formations is notable. =Ontogeny= Embryonic therizinosaurid based on stage D fossilized embryos At least four developmental embryonic stages were reported from the Nanchao embryos; Kundr√°t and colleagues classified them from stages A to D depending on the development. Stage A is the earliest of all and is characterized by the poor ossification of bones and the porous structure of the centra in the vertebral column. During stages B and C the bones become slightly more articulated and ossified. These seem to correspond with developmental levels of 45‚Äì50, and 64-day-old embryos of the american alligator. The last and more advanced stage is D where the embryos had completely ossiÔ¨Åed vertebral centra and a partially reduced neurocentral suture in their cervical vertebrae. Additionally, most therizinosaurian characters are more notorious in this phase, such as the edentulous premaxilla. The most mature embryo is represented by CAGS-01-IG-5, which had a clearly more developed ossiÔ¨Åcation than alligator hatchlings. This indicates that embryonic therizinosaurids reached a more mature skeleton than other archosaur hatchilngs in ovo and stayed within the egg for a longer period to enlarge their proportions despite the advanced ossification. Based on the developmental states preserved within embryos, Kundr√°t and colleagues suggested a rough incubation period between 1.5 and 3 months. Given that some embryos had their bones ossified and the fact that no adults were found in association with the nests, therizinosaurid hatchlings were highly precocial (capabale of locomotion from birth) and able to leave their nests to feed alone, independently of their parents. Subterraneously constructed nests could be an indicative of the lack of parental care during the incubation period, furthermore, the skeletal maturity of stage D embryos was considerably adapted to allow immediate locomotion after birth, potentially suggesting a superprecocial behaviour. The independence from their parents may also be supported by the development of the teeth of the hatchlings that is consistent to an omnivorous diet. Paleoecology Hadrosaurid-therizinosaurid occurrence in the Cantwell Formation Therizinosaurids were very specialized herbivores that evolved a convergent life-style to the more recent ground sloths. They are so similar in some aspects that this idea is also reflected in the name of several species, such as Nothronychus (slothful claw) or Suzhousaurus megatherioides (Megatherium-like). Multiple of their anatomical and physiological traits such as leaf-shaped, coarsely serrated teeth, strong arm build with large claws, a notoriously elongated neck and the development of a keratinous beak situate therizinosaurids as browser herbivores. More specifically, therizinosaurids inhabited high-browsing niches in their ecosystems and commonly lived in semi-arid to wetland-like habitats composed of high vegetation as seen on the fluvial-lacrustrine setting of most specimens. As reflected by at least 31 therizinosaurid footprints at the Cantwell Formation of Alaska, some species formed small herds, which is consistent with the complex brain and ear structure in these theropods. The co-occurrence with hadrosaurids on this area may also indicate that these very different dinosaurs benefited from an ecological interaction, just as some animals today congregate together for mutual beneficial reasons, such as augmented resource acquisition or lesser predation pressure. It is also possible that a herd of hadrosaurids and therizinosaurids walked across this terrain at different times and did not encounter each another. Regardless of these explanations, the therizinosaurid trackway reflects a gregarious behaviour in these theropods. Distribution Faunal exchange between Asia and North America Although the vast majority of all therizinosaurids have come out of Asia (especially from China and Mongolia), the relatively complete remains of Nothronychus have been found outside Asia in North America. Though the fossil record of therizinosaurids indicates that the family flourished near the Turonian stage of the Late Cretaceous, by the Barremian stage there was already a pan-Laurasian distribution of therizinosauroids. Since Laurasia was beginning to break apart during the Cretaceous, two theories have arisen to explain how therizinosaurs could have spanned across Laurasia. One theory is that primitive members were already present in both Asia and North America before it began to drift apart, suggesting an emergence for therizinosaurs of at least the Late Triassic. A second theory is that the group dispersed between Asia and North America via a \\"Cretaceous\\" Beringian land bridge during the Berriasian-Valanginian stages. This last proposal is supported by the presence of therizinosaurids in North America during the early Late Cretaceous such as Nothronychus. Nevertheless, therizinosaurid-grade footprints are known from remote locations such as Europe or Africa. Several four-toed tracks were found in Poland, and a series of footprints dating back to the Late Cretaceous were found in Morocco. Both findings may indicate that therizinosaurids were far more disperse than previously thought. The idea of a land bridge is even more supported by the multiple co-occurrence of hadrosaurid and therizinosaurid footprints at the lower Cantwell Formation of the Denali National Park, which reflects an important faunal exchange between landmasses. These tracks show the dominant presence of hadrosaurids and a reduced concentration of therizinosaurids in the same location at potentially the same time. As indicated by the discovery of a waterlily-like impression representing a single fossil leaf from the same site, the trackway was made by the dinosaurs as they crossed a shallow body of water away from the main river channels, which is curious given that during the Late Cretaceous this part of North America was a semi-arid habitat. This occurrence at this single locality within the lower Cantwell Formation has not been documented elsewhere in North America and these trackways represent the first reported encounter between notoriously different dinosaurs from North America. The diversity of the ichnotaxa in this site supports the idea of similar dinosaur faunas between Alaska and Asia during the Late Cretaceous period, specifically with the Nemegt Formation which had relatively wet environments. Fiorillo and colleagues suggested that Alaska represented a \\"gateway\\" for faunal exchange between the two continental landmasses and the existence of a \\"Cretaceous\\" Beringian land bridge further allowed this mixing of faunas, which was encouraged as similar habitats were present within Asia and North America.

H. Mulcaster, R.N., K.C.H.', Sketches of Celebrated Canadians, and Persons Connected with Canada: From the Earliest Period in the History of the Province Down to the Present Time, 1865, pp. 226-7 Early life He was the son of Major General Frederick George Mulcaster (27 February 1739/40 ‚Äì 18 August 1797) of the Royal Engineers and Mary Juliana Auchmuty (1750‚Äì1830), his father's second wife. His mother was a daughter of the Reverend Samuel Auchmuty DD (1725‚Äì1777), the Rector of Trinity Church, New York. It seems likely that he was named after General Sir William Howe, whom his father came to know as his ADC, when serving in America. His elder half-brother was Lt-Gen Sir Frederick William Mulcaster (1772‚Äì1846), born in Florida. The family returned to England together in 1778. William was baptised in Saint Helier, Jersey, Channel Islands on 30 October 1783. Naval career Mulcaster was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy in January 1800. In 1809, he was serving as a lieutenant in the sixth rate vessel HMS Confiance. One of his fellow officers was his future commander, James Lucas Yeo. Confiance played a significant part in the capture of Cayenne, for which Mulcaster received a commemorative sword from the Prince Regent of Portugal and was promoted to commander. He was appointed to command the brig- rigged sloop of war HMS Emulous serving at Halifax, Nova Scotia. Shortly after war with America broke out in 1812, Emulous was wrecked on Cape Sable Island, and Mulcaster was recruited for service on the Great Lakes by Yeo (whose frigate, HMS Southampton had also been wrecked shortly before in the Caribbean). Mulcaster was initially offered command of the flotilla on Lake Erie but he declined on grounds of the scarcity of resources there. Instead, he acted as second in command to Yeo. In that role, he commanded the sloop Royal George in 1813 in several actions on Lake Ontario against the American squadron led by Isaac Chauncey. Both combatants on Lake Ontario were building progressively larger ships of war. Yeo laid down a frigate, to be named Prince Regent, and requested the Admiralty to promote Mulcaster to the rank of Post- Captain to command her. This was agreed. Before the ship was launched, in late 1813, Mulcaster commanded several vessels from the Lake Ontario flotilla which were escorting supply convoys up the Saint Lawrence River. He encountered the vessels of American General James Wilkinson's expedition against Montreal at French Creek and harassed the American encampments. When Wilkinson set off down the Saint Lawrence, Mulcaster hastened to Kingston with the news and then sailed in pursuit with armed schooners and gunboats, with a detachment of soldiers commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Wanton Morrison embarked. On 11 November Mulcaster's gunboats helped goad Wilkinson into a hasty attack against Morrison which led to the American defeat at the Battle of Crysler's Farm. On 2 May 1814, the British fleet and army on Lake Ontario mounted the Raid on Fort Oswego to intercept supplies and armaments for the American fleet. Mulcaster took part in the landing, leading 200 sailors armed with boarding pikes but he was severely wounded by a grapeshot and eventually lost a leg. This ended his active career, for which he received a pension of ¬£300 and was nominated a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Later life In October 1814, he married Sophia Sawyer Van Cortlandt (1789‚Äì1841), the youngest daughter of Colonel Philip Van Cortlandt (1739‚Äì1814) and Catherine Ogden (1746‚Äì1828) and a descendant of Stephanus Van Cortlandt, the first native born Mayor of New York City and the Schuyler family, at Duloe in Cornwall. Colonel Van Cortlandt was an American of Dutch descent who had refused to take the colonists' side in the American War of Independence. Having lost his substantial property in America, he left with the evacuation of New York City and sailed to England with his wife and family in 1783. Mulcaster and his wife Sophia had at least seven children, but only four survived into adulthood. His two surviving sons, William Edward Mulcaster (1820‚Äì1887) and William Sydney Smith Mulcaster (1825‚Äì1910), both became generals. In 1831 he received a knighthood and became Naval aide de camp to King William IV. He died at Guilford Lawn in Dover on 12 March 1837 of complications of a severe wound he received in the War of 1812. He was buried at St Mary's Church, Bishopsbourne, Kent, and there is a memorial tablet to him in the church. References * * Genealogical research carried out by Catherine Plowden, direct descendant.

While the status does not automatically include a mutual defense pact with the United States, it still confers a variety of military and financial advantages that otherwise are not obtainable by non-NATO countries.  History  Prayut Chan-o-cha, commander-in-chief of the Royal Thai Army, in Arlington, Virginia, June 6, 2013 MNNA status was first created in 1987 when section 2350a, otherwise known as the Sam Nunn Amendment, was added to Title 10 (Armed Forces) of the United States Code by Congress.Title 10, section 2350a of U.S. Code It stipulated that cooperative research and development agreements could be enacted with non-NATO allies by the Secretary of Defense with the concurrence of the Secretary of State. The initial MNNAs were Australia, Egypt, Israel, Japan, and South Korea. In 1996, major non-NATO allies received additional military and financial benefits when section 2321k was added to Title 22 (Foreign Relations) of the U.S. Code (also known as section 517 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961), which added MNNAs to many of the same exemptions from the Arms Export Control Act that were enjoyed by NATO members. It also authorized the President to designate a nation as an MNNA thirty days after notifying Congress. When enacted, the statute designated the initial five countries as major non-NATO allies, and added Jordan and New Zealand to the list. U.S.-New Zealand strategic and military cooperation suffered a setback after the breakdown of the ANZUS alliance in 1984 over nuclear ship entry. The designation of New Zealand as an MNNA reflected the warming of relations between the two. In June 2012 New Zealand signed a partnership arrangement with NATO further strengthening and consolidating relations. In 1998, President Bill Clinton named Argentina as an ally for the \\"Argentine compromise and contribution to international peace and security\\" materialized in its participation in the Gulf War (being the only Latin American country to do so), and for its continuing support of United Nations peacekeeping missions. When Congress enacted on September 30, 2002, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY 2003, it required that Taiwan be \\"treated as though it were designated a major non-NATO ally.\\" Despite some initial misgivings about Congress's perceived intrusion into the President's foreign affairs authority, the Bush administration subsequently submitted a letter to Congress on August 29, 2003, designating Taiwan as a major non-NATO ally. Around the same time, invitations were sent to Thailand and the Philippines, both of whom accepted. Singapore was reportedly offered a similar arrangement, but turned the offer down. NSA Bahrain base is home to U.S. Naval Forces Central Command and U.S. Fifth Fleet Defense Secretary Jim Mattis meets with Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi during a meeting held at the Pentagon, April 5, 2017. In 2014, following the 2014 Crimean Crisis, a bill was introduced to the United States Congress to grant major non-NATO ally status to Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. \\\\- Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014 In May 2015, US President Barack Obama declared his intention to make Tunisia a non-NATO ally while hosting his Tunisian counterpart Beji Caid Essebsi at the White House. During a 2015 Camp David summit with the Gulf Cooperation Council states, the Obama administration considered designating Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Qatar as MNNAs. The designation of certain countries as major non-NATO allies has not been without controversy. US Representatives Ted Poe (R-TX) and Rick Nolan (D-MN) introduced H.R. 3000, a bill to revoke Pakistan's position as an MNNA, citing inadequate counterterrorism efforts, the harboring of Osama bin Laden and Pakistani support for the Taliban. In 2017, General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, accused Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of having ties to terror groups.\\"General Dunford: Pakistan intelligence has links to 'terrorists'\\". Al- Jazeera. October 4, 2017. Reuters reported that \\"possible Trump administration responses being discussed include expanding U.S. drone strikes and perhaps eventually downgrading Pakistan‚Äôs status as a major non-NATO ally.\\"\\"Mattis says will try to work with Pakistan 'one more time'\\". Reuters. October 3, 2017. In 2019, Donald Trump designated Brazil as a major non-NATO ally after receiving a working visit from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. A bill to make Ukraine a major non-NATO ally was introduced into the US House of Representatives in May 2019. In June 2019 US lawmakers provided for enhancements to India's status, though this fell short of making them a MNNA.  Benefits  Nations named as major non-NATO allies are eligible for the following benefits: * entry into cooperative research and development projects with the Department of Defense (DoD) on a shared-cost basis * participation in certain counter-terrorism initiatives * purchase of depleted uranium anti-tank rounds * priority delivery of military surplus (ranging from rations to ships) * possession of War Reserve Stocks of DoD-owned equipment that are kept outside of American military bases * loans of equipment and materials for cooperative research and development projects and evaluations * permission to use American financing for the purchase or lease of certain defense equipment * reciprocal training * expedited export processing of space technology * permission for the country's corporations to bid on certain DoD contracts for the repair and maintenance of military equipment outside the United States Major Strategic Partner In December 2014 the US House passed the United States‚ÄìIsrael Strategic Partnership Act of 2013. This new category would have placed Israel one notch above the Major Non-NATO Ally classification and would have added additional support for defense, energy, and strengthen cooperation business and academics. The bill additionally called for the US to increase their war reserve stock in Israel to US$1.8 billion. The bill did not reach a vote, and as such did not pass or become law.  Major Defence Partner  In 2018 USA recognized India as a ‚Äúmajor defence partner‚Äù. The description came less than a month after the House of Representatives passed the ‚ÄòUS India Defense Technology and Partnership Act‚Äô.

It was the American author's first book for children, completed at the midpoint of nearly two decades living in England and Switzerland. Although set in her hometown Euclid, Ohio, it was not published in her native country until 1995 (HarperCollins), after she won the annual Newbery Medal recognizing Walk Two Moons as the preceding year's best American children's book. Absolutely Normal Chaos is a 13-year-old girl's \\"complete and unabridged journal for English class\\" and can be classed as a bildungsroman. Synopsis Mary Lou Finney is more than excited about her assignment to keep a journal over the summer. Not only does she have to keep a journal, but she must read The Odyssey. The Odyssey is continuously referenced within her own writing. She adds her own comments about the Odyssey that reference to her own life. As the novel unfolds, Mary Lou's cousin, Carl Ray stays with her family. Carl Ray does this in order to look for a job. As the novel progresses, Mary Lou learns about Carl Ray's difficulties in life and how he has struggled. After discovering this information, Mary Lou finds it easier to examine her struggles with her family, her friends, and herself. Sharon Creech stated that the inspiration for this story was an occasion when, \\"I'd been living overseas (England and Switzerland) for about ten years, and I was sadly missing my family back in the States. I thought I'd write a story about normal family chaos and that's how this began, with me trying to remember what it was like growing up in my family.

Pure Dead Magic was Gliori's first novel. The chronicles follow the Strega Borgias, a quirky, bizarre, Italian family: Signor and Signora Strega-Borgia (Luciano and Baci) and their four children, Titus, Pandora, Damp and Nieve, who live with their mythical companions in their fictitious home StregaSchloss, in Argyll. It consists of two trilogies: Pure Dead and Deep. The Strega-Borgias share similarities to The Addams Family. Characters=The family *Signor Luciano Strega-Borgia - The sometimes hot-tempered husband of Baci and father of Titus, Pandora, Damp and Nieve. He is very fond of his family, despite leaving them in a temper in the first book and frequently arguing with Baci. Enjoys coffee, especially cappuccino. *Signora Baci Strega-Borgia - Luciano's wife, mother to Titus, Pandora, Damp and Nieve. She dislikes being pregnant. Baci attends a witch academy, although she is absolutely appalling at magic. *Titus, son of the above. Twelve during the series Titus is something of a computer geek. His laptop has been used for, amongst other things, growing rather a lot of small pink clones, and receiving video clips from the future. Titus loves food, especially raspberry muffins. He has/had a band. Titus is terrified of spiders but unlike most arachnophobics seems willing to tolerate them when he has to. *Pandora - Titus's younger sister, ten or eleven during the series. Pandora is occasionally obsessed with makeup, much to the distress of her father who believes her far too young for it. She believes that technology is dreadful and loves her pet rats, Multitudina and Terminus. Pandora is probably the most observant and intelligent of the Borgias. During the series she gains a card for the Library, an assortment of magical items, and run by the centaur, Alpha. *Damp - The youngest Strega- Borgia up till the final book, the aptly named Damp is a baby magus who constantly keeps her nanny on her toes preventing Damp's magic from being discovered by her parents. Damp has a bat familiar called Vesper. She is a messy little girl who loves colours and glitter but in Pure Dead Brilliant she is revealed to grow up to be an arrogant and haughty individual. (This may change, seeing as that was the future in which Titus died, and was changed before the events starting to lead to that occurred.) *Nieve (a.k.a. \\"little no name\\" or \\"somebody else entirely\\") - The new baby and younger son of the Borgias' Nieve was born in the beginning of the last book. It is implied Nieve may be as powerful a magus as his sister Damp. Nieve has a salamander familiar called Orynx. He apparently has dark brown eyes (as revealed through his internal monologues in Deep Water). **REVISION**: Though in Deep Fear (the last book) Nieve's eyes are continuously referred to as navy blue. However, this is not to be confused with the green eyes of the demon baby/changeling that takes Nieve's place with Baci for most of the book. As for Nieve being a magus, the reader is left with the suggestion that he may instead be an earthbound (or fallen angel) when Damp notices that he has fine downy feathers like angel wings around his shoulders. This is reinforced when Damp motions to Nieve that she has noticed and will keep the 'secret.' However, it is also suggested that the feathers COULD be left over from the Swan transformation. Unfortunately, we never find out for sure and the reader is left wondering as to which it is. *Strega-Nonna (Amelia) - Cryogenically preserved six-times- great grandmother of Titus, Pandora, Damp and Nieve. She was an extremely powerful witch in her time and retains some of her power. She lives in the freezer where she lives in cryogenic preservation until science finds a cure for death and old age. This is treated as a matter of humour during most of the series but Sab considers her desperation to evade death sad as shown by his existentialist brodding in Deep Trouble. Strega-Nonna's cryogenic preservation is somewhat contradicted by the fact that witches are portrayed as immortal in the series. She may have known Mrs McLachlan as a child. *Don Lucifer di S'Embowelli Borgia - Luciano's evil half-brother. Don Lucifer hates his brother and often tries to kill him. He is a high player in the Mafia. Don Lucifer has had plastic surgery on his face, to reduce the size of his nose. Unfortunately, it went wrong and made him look and sound, like a rat. Don Lucifer serves as one of the main antagonists of the series. In Pure Dead Brilliant he inherits millions, signed over to him by Titus (originally inherited from his grandfather, Don Chimera) *Don Chimera - father of Luciano Strega-Borgia. Appears briefly in the first book, in a flashback to the birth of Titus. The Beasts The series takes place in a world similar to our own but where magical creatures are apparently quite commonplace. Among the pets belonging to Strega-Borgias are a large menagerie of sentient animals and monsters collectively referred as the Beasts. It is worth noting that Tarantella resents being called a Beast and instead refers to herself as \\"an arachnid.\\" *Ffup - A teenage dragon. Pregnant twice during the series, mother to Nestor, fianc√©e to The Sleeper. Fairly selfish, especially when it comes to nails and dieting. Strangely she is referred to as \\"he\\" throughout the first book. This was caused by the fact that Ffup did not realize that \\"he\\" was in fact a girl during the first book. In Pure Dead Wicked, Ffup finally realized that she was a female with a slightly hinted encounter with a male. *Sab - The intellectual of the beasts, Sab is a gryphon with a fondness for cross-words. He and Strega-Nonna are revealed to be old friends in Deep Trouble. He is egotistical and has the ability to turn into stone. Gryphons according to Sab have very long lifespans and are widely believed to be immortal although this is not the case. *Tock ‚Äì A crocodile, who lives in the castle moat. Supposedly a vegetarian by the later books. *Knot - A yeti who loves revolting food (including Marie Bain's slippers and the contents of Nestor's nappies). *Nestor - Ffup's young son, a half dragon. *Multitudina the Illiterat - An illiterate rat who 'was raised to eat books, not read them'. She is a free- range rat and one of Pandora's many pets. Multitudina has an intelligent daughter named Terminus. *Terminus - One of Multitudina's many children and one of Pandora's pets. In contrast to her \\"illiterat\\" mother Terminus is highly intelligent and well-educated and she and Tarantella have many intellectual discussions. *Tarantella - Pandora's pet spider. A highly sarcastic but very intelligent individual Tarantella is obsessed with lipstick and fond of eating male spiders. She is missing one leg after losing it to Fiamma D'Infer. Gliori acknowledges her similarities to the character of Tarentella. *The Sleeper - Fianc√©e of Ffup and Father to Nestor. Also known as the Loch Ness Monster, lives in Lochnagargoyle Loch on the Strega-Borgia grounds. He loves it when his fianc√©e brings him food and places it under the jetty but is caught two-timing her in Deep Fear. He has a strong Scottish accent and a somewhat surly and misanthropic approach to life. *Orynx - A salamander that, when it burns, makes light. \\"The good help that was hard to find\\" *Mrs Flora McLachlan ‚Äì Nanny to Titus, Pandora, Damp and Nieve. A gifted, and ancient witch who sometimes secretly helps Baci out with her spells. She is famous for her cooking skills especially with cakes and chips. *Marie Bain - The terrible French StregaSchloss cook. She makes disgusting food and gets very offended if the family doesn't like or eat it. In the fifth book, bribed by Don Lucifer, she arranges Luciano's arrest (see below) and later chokes to death on a putrid Christmas cake of her own making, which was rejected by the Streaga-Borgias the previous year. *Latch ‚Äì Long suffering butler to the Borgias. He answers the door and the phone. Latch often irons the newspaper. He falls in love with Miss McClachlan and eventually marries her. It is also mentioned that he is forced to wear a kilt made out of material used as a dog's bed, and hates it because it itches. Owns a small Japanese car. *Miss Araminta Fraser (Minty) ‚Äì Secondary nanny employed during Mrs McLachlan's absence. An inventive cook and all round nice person. Falls in love with Ludo Grabbit. The immortals Aside from Mrs McLachlan, many immortal characters appear in the series due to its nature as fantasy. The arch-villains of the series are demons who seek possession of the Chronostone with which they will be able to rule the universe. The Chronostone once belonged to the ruler of Hell, S'tan the Boss but he lost it and the main plot of the series concerns his quest to regain it by sending various minions to do battle with Mrs McLachlan for possession of the Stone. Mrs McLachlan is the only person aware of the threat posed by the demons although Titus, Pandora and Latch become aware of them. The demons are portrayed as extremely powerful and irredeemably evil creatures but are nonetheless used to great comic effect. Most demons in the series are cynical, egotistical and cruel but with a dry sense of humour. *Astaroth - is the Second Minister of the Hadean Executive. He accidentally loses the Chronostone and the plot of Pure Dead Brilliant concerns his quest to regain it for his Boss. He disguises himself as a beautiful witch named Fiamma D'Infer to do so, but after his/her failure he is reincarnated as a gnat in punishment and later becomes imprisoned in amber. He possesses the sarcastic sense of humour that apparently comes naturally to all high ranking demons in the series. *Isagoth: The Demonic Defence Minister, Isagoth is a demon determined to regain the Chronostone for his master, S'tan but later plans to steal it for his own ends. He is introduced in Deep Trouble and becomes one of the major antagonists over the course of the series. *S'tan the Boss: The ruler of Hades and the main antagonist of the series, S'tan is in fact the Biblical character of the Devil. He draws his power from the Chronostone. The main plotline of the books concerns his quest to regain it. In Deep Water, after the Stone drops out of the time space continuum, he discovers that he is losing his power. As a result the stress due to his power loss he becomes very overweight. He develops an interest in cooking in Deep Fear. His name is a play on the word \\"Satan\\". Other *Pronto - Don Lucifer Di S'Embowelli's right-hand man. He is very intelligent and presents a soothing foil to his psychotic boss in his moments of hysteria. He was accidentally turned into bagpipes by Mrs. McLachlan in Pure Dead Magic. It is implied that Latch left him in the attic. *Attila The Bun - One of the four gangsters hired to take out Titus Strega- Borgia, and anyone who stands in their way, in Don Lucifer's attempt to steal Titus' fortune.

The film is silent and made in the Kinemacolor additive color process. The film records the 12 December 1911 celebrations in India which marked the coronation of George V and Mary of Teck and their proclamation as Emperor and Empress of India. The film is often referred to as The Delhi Durbar or The Durbar at Delhi. Although it is commonly referred to as a single film, it is more accurate to think of it as a set of films documenting the royal visit to India in December 1911, with the Durbar ceremony as the centrepiece. Different showings of With Our King and Queen Through India would be made up of different sets of the films, so that the show (a more accurate concept) was exhibited in several different lengths. Today only two reels survive, one showing a review of troops after the main ceremony and the other a procession in Calcutta from the end of the royal tour. Production The film showcased the use of Kinemacolor, which had been launched by Charles Urban in 1908 as the first successful natural colour motion picture process. It was produced by Urban's Natural Color Kinematograph Company and he took five camera operators with him: Joseph De Frenes, Albuin Mariner, Alfred Gosden, Hiram Horton and an unidentified fifth (possibly John Mackenzie). Charles Urban (centre) and camera team at Delhi in 1911 Frames from lost sequence of With Our King and Queen Through India showing the state entry into Delhi. Kinemacolor films appear black-and-white - the colour effect occurs in projection British filmmakers had previously filmed the Delhi Durbar marking the coronation of King Edward VII in 1903 (which Edward did not attend). Release and reception The films were premiered at the Scala Theatre, London on 2 February 1912, with an accompaniment provided by a live orchestra of forty- eight pieces, a chorus of twenty-four, a twenty-piece fife and drum corps, and three bagpipes. The music echoed that played at the actual ceremonies in Delhi. The stage set featured a mock-up of the Taj Mahal, and there were elaborate lighting effects. Live commentary was provided by the Scala's stage manager St John Hamund. An article in the American periodical Munsey's Magazine praised the music, describing the band as \\"one of the best I have heard in London\\". The full show was made up of several sections, according to the 1912 Kinemacolor catalogue: # Royal Visit to Bombay (2‚Äì4 December 1911) # Scenes in Delhi, the New Capital of India # Arrival of the Ruling Chiefs at Kingsway Station, Delhi # Preparing for the Durbar - the Chiefs' Camps # The Royal Horse Artillery Firing a Salute # Arrival of Their Imperial Majesties at Selimgarh Station # Arrival at the Reception Tent, Delhi Fort (7 December 1911) # The State Entry into Delhi (7 December 1911) # The Royal Procession passing from the Ridge to the King's Camp (Delhi, 7 December 1911) # King Edward Memorial Ceremony (Delhi, 8 December 1911) # Presentation of Colors (11 December 1911) # The Delhi Polo Tournament (7 to 11 December 1911) # THE CORONATION DURBAR AT DELHI (12 December 1911) # The State Garden Party at Delhi Fort (13 December 1911) # The Royal Review of 50,000 Troops (Delhi, 14 December) [film survives] # Point to Point Races (Delhi, December, 13th, 1911) # State Departure of Their Imperial Majesties (Delhi, 16 December 1911) # The King's Camp and the Chiefs' Receptions # Preparations for the Calcutta Pageant # Arrival and Reception of Their Imperial Majesties at Princep's Ghat Calcutta (30 December 1911) # The Pageant Procession [film survives] # Their Imperial Majesties' Departure from Calcutta (8 January 1912) When the film was released, there had been several short black-and-white films of the Delhi Durbar made already by other companies. With Our King and Queen Through India made a huge impact worldwide because of its colour, length and multi-media spectacle. It had a great appeal for middle class audiences that had previously avoided film shows because of their low social status, and it was exhibited before royalty. George V saw it at the Scala on 11 May 1912, accompanied by Queen Mary, Queen Alexandra and Empress Maria of Russia. The Empress wrote to her son Nicholas II of Russia about the show. We are lunching today with Georgie and May at Buckingham Palace. They both send you greetings. Last night we saw their journey to India. Kinemacolor is wonderfully interesting and very beautiful and gives one the impression of having seen it all in reality. The films were also shown at Buckingham Palace on 12 December 1912. One of the surviving sequences from the film, The Pageant Procession, has been released on the DVD set Kinemacolor and Other Magic.Kinemacolor e altre magie / Kinemacolor and Other Magic (Cineteca Bologna, 2017) See also * List of early color feature films * List of incomplete or partially lost films ReferencesExternal links * * Description of complete show with colour illustrations from 1912 Kinemacolor catalogue * Category:1912 films Category:1910s color films Category:British films Category:British silent feature films Category:British documentary films Category:1912 documentary films Category:Films shot in Delhi Category:Documentary films about British royalty Category:George V Category:Documentary films about India Category:Silent films in color Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Lost British films Category:1912 lost films Category:Early color films ","title":"With Our King and Queen Through India"},{"id":"3812528","text":"Denis Joseph Oullahan (1824 - November 5, 1889) served as California State Treasurer 1884‚Äì1887.

Life Alekan was born in Montmartre in 1909. At the age of sixteen he and his brother became travelling puppeteers. A little later he started work as third assistant cameraman at the Billancourt Studios. He then spent a short time in the army, returning to Billancourt in 1931. In the late 1930s he was the camera operator to Eugene Shufftan on Marcel Carn√©'s Quai des Brumes and Dr√¥le de drame . He was greatly influenced by Schufftan's non-naturalistic style. His first success as a director of photography was Ren√© Cl√©ment's realistic war drama La Bataille du Rail of 1946. In the same year he worked on Jean Cocteau's fable La Belle et la B√™te. He found himself out of sympathy with the French New Wave cinema which emerged in the late 1950s and Alekan shot some rather conventional films in Hollywood. A new generation of directors appreciated his visionary style, and he worked with Ra√∫l Ruiz on The Territory and On Top of the Whale and with Wim Wenders on The State Of Things and Wings of Desire . His last films were made with the Israeli director Amos Gitai. He wrote one of the best books about cinematography Des lumi√®res et des ombres (1984, √âditions du Collectionneur).. Death Alekan died from leukemia on 15 June 2001 in Auxerre, Bourgogne, aged 92.

The headline reads: \\"Comrade Nicolae Ceau»ôescu's speech for radio and television stations\\" (official answer to the outbreak of the Romanian Revolution) Sc√Ænteia (\\"The Spark\\"; the initial spelling of the name in Romanian was Sc√¢nteia until the change of the orthography in 1953, as it would have been again, the orthography having officially reverted in 1993) was the name of two newspapers edited by Communist groups at different intervals in Romanian history. The title was a calque from the Russian Iskra. History=1919 in Odessa The first paper of that name was edited by Romanian revolutionaries in Bolshevist Russia, appearing throughout 1919 in the city of Odessa. In Romania (1931-1989) Miner reading Sc√¢nteia Sc√¢nteia reemerged as the official voice of the Communist Party of Romania on August 15, 1931, being published clandestinely in Bucharest until 1940 (when the hostility between Romania and the Soviet Union grew to a level where a crackdown on communist propaganda became imminent). With Romania withdrawing from the Axis and joining the Allies in August 1944, Sc√¢nteia was yet again being published, to remain the approved, sanctioning, body of communist politics. During Communist Romania (since early 1948), it was the barometer of policy changes, and the main medium through which the regime indicated its aims (for example, Sc√Ænteia served as the tribune for slander campaigns against intellectuals such as Tudor Arghezi). Moreover, in 1961, August 15, the date the newspaper had first been published in Romania 30 years previously, was declared the Romanian Press Day \\\\- indicative of the relations between the official voice and other media. The headquarters of the paper were the main feature of the Socialist Realist Combinatul Poligrafic Casa Sc√Ænteii \\"I.V.Stalin\\", a name later reduced to Casa Sc√Ænteii, after it dropped the reference to Joseph Stalin during De- Stalinization. Today, the building goes by the name Casa Presei Libere (\\"The House of the Free Press\\"). Sc√Ænteia was accompanied by a youth version, one edited by the Union of Communist Youth (a branch of the Party that resembled the Soviet Komsomol up to a point). Sc√Ænteia Tineretului (or Sc√¢nteia tineretului; approximately \\"Youth's Spark\\") began its edition in November 1944. It was also published under the names of Tinere»õea (\\"The Youth\\") and T√ÆnƒÉrul Muncitor (or T√¢nƒÉrul Muncitor; \\"The Young Worker\\").

History The Washington State Apple Blossom Festival, originally called \\"Blossom Days\\", was founded in 1919 to celebrate the importance of the apple industry to the region. The Ladies Musical Club produced the first festival in 1920, a one-day event in Memorial Park involving songs, speeches, maypoles, and baseball. The festival's relative success in drawing in large crowds from the area assured the continuation of the festival in subsequent years. In 1921, the Commercial Club, forerunner of the Wenatchee Valley Chamber of Commerce, took over sponsorship of the celebration. When the festival began again after World War II, the festival was renamed the Washington State Apple Blossom Festival to more accurately reflect the importance of the apple industry in North Central Washington. In 1967, Wenatchee established a sister city relationship with the Aomori Apple Blossom Festival in Japan. On what would've been the centennial anniversary in 2020, officials cite the COVID-19 pandemic as grounds for cancellation. There were other cancellations from 1942 to 1945.

Kesavan (23 May 1891 ‚Äì 7 July 1969) was the Chief Minister of Travancore- Cochin during 1950‚Äì1952. He was born in 1891 in the village of Mayyanad, near Kollam in the then princely state of Travancore. For some time he worked as a teacher and then took a law degree from Thiruvananthapuram and started practice in Kollam. Kesavan was influenced by the work of Padmanabhan Palpu, the social reform campaigner who was a member of the backward Ezhava community and a founder of the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana association where he later rose to the general secretary post. He became an activist for the Ezhava caste, seeking an improved socio-economic position for them, and in the 1930s he suggested that they should abandon Hinduism. Thus he was an atheist. C. Kesavan was influenced by the teachings of Sree Narayana Guru, Gandhiji and Karl Marx. He worked for temperance and eradication of untouchability and served as General Secretary of SNDP Yogam. From 1933, C. Kesavan was one of the prominent leaders of Abstention movement or Nivarthana Prakshobham in Travancore of present-day Kerala. Because of a speech he made at a public meeting in Kozhencherry he was arrested on 7 June 1935, tried for sedition, and sentenced to two years imprisonment. In Kesavan took an active part in organizing Travancore State Congress and became a member of its working Committee. During the agitation for responsible government in Travancore, he was arrested several times. During Quit India Movement in 1942, Kesavan was sentenced to one year simple imprisonment and was released on 19 July 1943. After Independence, Kesavan was elected to Travancore Assembly and became a member of the first cabinet headed by Pattom Thanu Pillai, but resigned after few months. Kesavan became Chief Minister of the erstwhile Travancore-Cochin (Thiruvithamkoor-Kochi) state in 1951 and was elected to State Assembly in 1952. C. Kesavan was considered to be one of the Triumvirate of Travancore (Thiruvithaamkoor) State Congress leadership, the other two being Pattom A. Thanu Pillai and T.M. Varghese. Kesavan wrote an incomplete autobiography, Jeevitha-Samaram, consisting of two volumes that described his life up to the time of his political prominence. A third volume was planned to cover that later period but was unwritten at the time of his death. The work combined the story of his own life with a wider narrative concerning the plight of the Ezhava caste of which he was a member. Udaya Kumar says that his \\"early memories are tinged with two lines of injustice: the discrimination he suffered as an Ezhava boy on the streets and other public places, where he was forced to defer to upper-caste people, and the unjust exercise of authority by the elders and the upper sub-divisions within the Ezhava caste\\". Statue of C. Kesavan in Thiruvananthapuram. The Kollam Corporation Town Hall was named the C. Kesavan Memorial Municipal Town Hall in Kesavan's memory. It is a decades- old building situated on the National Highway passing through the Kollam Cantonment. The building is now one of the main venues for several cultural events and meetings. He was instrumental in the starting of Medical College at Thiruvananthapuram. His presence is recorded in the batch photo of first batch of doctors from the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram. He has also worked for establishing a Govt Hospital in his home town Mayyanad. Which functioned well in its helm days and later shrunk to a health center.  As Chief Minister  C. Kesavan sworn in as Chief Minister of Travancore-Cochin on 3 March 1951. T.K. Narayana Pillai and A.J. John were the ministers. Both the ministers resigned in September 1951. New ministers sworn in were : K.M. Kora (Finance & Food), G. Chandrasekhara Pillai (PWD), L.M. Pylee (Education & Revenue), P.K. Krishnankutty Menon (Industries & Labour). After the declaration of general election of 1952, C. Kesavan ministry relinquished power on 12 March 1952. The historic Land Reforms Bill was piloted by C. Kesavan, but failed to pass through. The Trivandrum Medical College was opened by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru during C. Kesavan's tenure. A controversial statement made by C. Kesavan before he becoming Travancore -Kochi CM is history. When the fire broke out in Sabarimala, during May 1950 in the following months C. Kesavan, in his characteristic frankness said: \\"If a temple is destroyed that much of religious fanaticism will go off.\\"  Personal life  C.Kesavan was married to Vasanthi who was the daughter of C. V. Kunhiraman, the founder of Kerala Kaumudi. His son K. R. Bhadran died in an Air India Dakota plane crash near Mettupalayam in December 1950. At that time Kesavan was living in Ross House at Thiruvananthapuram which was widely considered as a haunted house and bad omen among political class of Kerala.

Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Threatt played college basketball at the West Virginia Institute of Technology from 1979 to 1983. Threatt, who has the distinction of being the last sixth round pick to play in the NBA (the NBA draft was shortened to the now-current two rounds in 1989), played in the NBA from 1983-1997 and finished his basketball career overseas. Professional career Threatt was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers in the sixth round of the 1983 NBA draft. He played for four seasons for the 76ers and was traded to the Chicago Bulls in 1986. In 1988, he was traded to the Seattle SuperSonics for Sam Vincent.https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/threase01.html He played for Seattle for four seasons before being traded to the Los Angeles Lakers on October 2, 1991, in exchange for three second round draft picks. Threatt was expected to play a backup role to Magic Johnson. However, after Johnson's sudden retirement for medical reasons (he announced that he was HIV positive), Threatt became the starting point guard. Threatt's ability to steal the ball earned him the nickname \\"The Thief\\" from Lakers commentators Chick Hearn and Stu Lantz. Threatt led the Lakers in assists, steals and minutes played each in his first two seasons. In 1992-93, he became the second player in Lakers franchise history (after Johnson) to lead the Lakers in scoring (15.1), assists (6.9), and steals (1.7). He scored a career high 42 points against the New York Knicks on March 10, 1992, and scored a career playoff high 35 points in Game 1 of the 1993 Western Conference Quarterfinals against the Phoenix Suns. He retired from the NBA after the 1996-97 season and went on to play basketball with the Gymnastikos S. Larissas (Greece) before retiring in 2002.

Background With the notable exceptions of the martyrdom of Cuthbert Mayne and several others the bloody persecution of Catholics under Queen Elizabeth I did not begin in earnest until more than 20 years into her reign. The frenzy of persecution was triggered by real conspiracies to remove the Queen, by her excommunication by Pope Pius V and by the hysteria that accompanied the arrival of the Jesuit St Edmund Campion on the English Mission in 1580. St Edmund and his colleagues brought to an end prevailing confusion over whether Catholics could in good conscience obey laws that compelled them to attend new Anglican services. Catholics were assured that they could not.\\"Blessed Robert Johnson\\", Diocese of Shrewsbury Life John Shert was born at Shert Hall near Macclesfield, Cheshire, and received his degree from Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1566.Wainewright, John. \\"Blessed John Shert.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

He was also an accomplished archaeologist, and is regarded as the pioneer of the museum curator's profession in Turkey. He was the founder of Istanbul Archaeology Museums and of Istanbul Academy of Fine Arts (Sanayi-i Nefise Mektebi in Turkish), known today as the Mimar Sinan University of Fine Arts. Early life Osman Hamdi was the son of Ibrahim Edhem Pasha, an Ottoman Grand Vizier (in office 1877‚Äì1878, replacing Midhat Pasha) who was originally a Greek boy from the Ottoman island of Sakƒ±z (Chios) orphaned at a very young age following the Chios massacre there. He was adopted by Kaptan-ƒ± Derya (Grand Admiral) H√ºsrev Pasha\\"Kaplumbaƒüa Terbiyecisi\\", Osman Hamdi Bey'in Romanƒ±, Emre Can, Kapƒ± Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, 2008, pp 200‚Äì201 and eventually rose to the ranks of the ruling class of the Ottoman Empire. Osman Hamdi in his youth Osman Hamdi went to primary school in the popular Istanbul quarter of Be≈üikta≈ü;The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Vol.7, Edited by Hugh Chisholm, (1911), 3; \\"Constantinople, the capital of the Turkish Empire...\\". after which he studied Law, first in Istanbul (1856) and then in Paris (1860). However, he decided to pursue his interest in painting instead, left the Law program, and trained under French orientalist painters Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me and Gustave Boulanger.Wendy M.K. Shaw, Possessors and Possessed: Museums, Archaeology, and visualisation of history in the late Ottoman Empire. University of California Press 2003, p. 98 During his nine- year stay in Paris, the international capital of fine arts at the time, he showed a keen interest for the artistic events of his day.Bloom J. and Blair, S., The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture, Oxford University Press, 2009 Vol. 3, p.361 His stay in Paris was also marked by the first ever visit by an Ottoman sultan to Western Europe, when Sultan Abd√ºlaziz was invited to the Exposition Universelle (1867) by Emperor Napoleon III. He also met many of the Young Ottomans in Paris, and even though he was exposed to their liberal ideas, he did not participate in their political activities, being the son of an Ottoman pasha who was loyal to the sultan and did not challenge the old absolutist system. Osman Hamdi Bey also met his first wife Marie, a French woman, in Paris when he was a student. After receiving his father's blessings, she accompanied him to Istanbul (Constantinople) when he returned in 1869, where the two got married and had two daughters. Once back in Turkey, he was sent to the Ottoman province of Baghdad as part of the administrative team of Midhat Pasha (the leading political figure and reformer among the Young Ottomans who enacted the First Ottoman Constitution in 1876, Midhat Pasha served as the Grand Vizier between 1876‚Äì1877, before being replaced by ƒ∞brahim Edhem Pasha, Osman Hamdi Bey's father.)W. Shaw, p. 98 In 1871, Osman Hamdi returned to Istanbul, as the vice-director of the Protocol Office of the Palace. During the 1870s, he worked on several assignments in the upper echelons of the Ottoman bureaucracy. Career Osman Hamdi exhibited three paintings at the 1867 Paris Exposition Universelle. None seem to have survived today, but their titles were Repose of the Gypsies, Black Sea Soldier Lying in Wait, and Death of the Soldier. An important step in his career was his assignment as the director of the Imperial Museum (M√ºze-i H√ºmayun) in 1881. He used his position as museum director to develop the museum and rewrite the antiquities laws and to create nationally sponsored archaeological expeditions. Osman Hamdi focused on building relationships with international institutions, notably the University of Pennsylvania, from which he received an honorary degree in 1894. In 1902, he painted the excavation of Nippur as a gift to the University of Pennsylvania Museum. In 1882, he instituted and became director of the Academy of Fine Arts, which provided Ottomans with training in aesthetics and artistic techniques without leaving the empire.W. Shaw, p. 99 In 1884, he oversaw the promulgation of a Regulation prohibiting historical artifacts from being smuggled abroad (Asar-ƒ± At√Æka Nizamnamesi), a giant step in constituting a legal framework of preservation of the antiquities. Representatives or middlemen of 19th-century European Powers routinely smuggled artifacts with historical value from within the boundaries of the Ottoman Empire (which then comprised the geographies of ancient Greek and Mesopotamian civilizations, among others), often resorting to shadily obtained licenses or bribes, to enrich museums in European capitals. He conducted the first scientific based archaeological researches done by a Turkish team. His digs included sites as varied as the Commagene tomb-sanctuary in Nemrut Daƒüƒ± in southeastern Anatolia (a top tourist's venue in Turkey and a UNESCO World Heritage Site today, within the Adƒ±yaman Province), the Hekate sanctuary in Lagina in southwestern Anatolia (much less visited, and within the Muƒüla Province today), and Sidon in Lebanon. The sarcophagi he discovered in Sidon (including the one known as the Alexander Sarcophagus, although this sarcophagus is thought to contain the remains of either Abdalonymus, King of Sidon; or Mazaeus, a Persian noble who was also the governor of Babylon) are considered among the worldwide jewels of archaeological findings. To lodge these, he started building what is today the Istanbul Archaeology Museum in 1881. The museum officially opened in 1891 under his directorship. Throughout his professional career as museum and academy director, Osman Hamdi continued to paint in the style of his teachers, G√©r√¥me and Boulanger. Yet, he frequently depicted himself and his family members in these paintings, complicating an assumption of a removed orientalist gaze in his work. The Tortoise Trainer Hamdi's 1906 painting, The Tortoise Trainer, has held the record until 2019 for the most valuable Turkish painting, after being sold for 5 million Turkish Liras (approx. US$3.5 million) in December 2004. At the 2004 Artam Antik A.√á. auction in Istanbul, the Pera Museum and the Turkish Modern Museum fought to acquire the painting, and was ultimately purchased by the Pera Museum. The painting depicts Hamdi's likeness clad in antiquated clothing, training tortoises in a mosque. This choice of subject matter leads many to see this painting as a commentary on Turkey's conflicted national identity. The painting expresses a sarcastic innuendo on the painter's own view of his style of work compared to those of his collaborators and apprentices, and is also a reference to the historical fact of tortoises having been employed for illuminating and decorative purposes, by placing candles on the shell, in evening outings during the Tulip Era in the early 18th century. The painting was acquired by the Suna and ƒ∞nan Kƒ±ra√ß Foundation and is currently on display at the Pera Museum in ƒ∞stanbul, which was established by this foundation. His Girl Reciting Qur'an (1880) broke the record by realizing US$7.8 million at a Bonhams auction in September 2019. Modern researchers have identified the animals portrayed are Testudo graeca ibera, a variety of the Spur-thighed tortoise. A reproduction of the painting appeared on the cover of the Bibliotheca Herpetologica issue in which the paper about the identification was published.Bettelheim, Matthew P. and Ertan Taskavak. 2006. \\"The Tortoise and the Tulip ‚Äì Testudo graeca ibera and Osman Hamdi's The Tortoise Trainer\\". Bibliotheca Herpetologica. 6(2): pp 11‚Äì15. The paper is mentioned, and the magazine cover is shown, at ISHBH publication list Historian Edhem Eldem has identified the source of the painting as an engraving of a Korean circus entertainer printed in Le Tour du Monde (1869) which was a popular French travel magazine. The meaning or any symbolic significance of the tortoises is still contested by scholars. Work Osman Hamdi was a prolific painter and author, whose work dealt with themes of archaeology, travel and folk customs in the Middle East. Hamdi studied painting in Paris under Gustave Boulanger and Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, two prominent artists in the French Orientalist school. Despite being trained by G√©r√¥me and Boulanger, and his reproduction of European orientalist motifs, Hamdi's paintings present Ottoman subjects differently than his contemporaries' works, most notably giving them more active and intellectual roles. Hamdi's status as an Ottoman intellectual causes many to see his use of orientalist motifs as subversive and critical of European orientalism. During his lifetime, his artwork was displayed more frequently in Europe than in Turkey. From 1880 on, he exhibited in Paris, Vienna, Berlin, Munich and London, and started a Salon in Constantinople. His works bear witness to a patient and conscientious method, and may be considered as documents of art history. He was the first who dared break with the Turkish pictorial tradition. Among his works are Prophet‚Äôs Tomb at Brussa, Miraculous Springs (Paris 1904), Reading the Coran 1890, Theologian (Patrimony of the Austrian Court). These paintings can be found in private collections and in museums in Vienna, Paris, Liverpool, New York, Berlin and Constantinople (at the Palace of Dolma Bagdsche, at the home of Crown Prince Abdulmedjid). His painting Reading the Coran has been exhibited at ‚ÄúXI BIENNALE INTERNATIONALE DES ANTIQUAIRES‚Äù in Paris in 1982 and at the ‚ÄúFINE ART OF THE NETHERLANDS‚Äù at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York in November 1982.

The town was founded in 1900 by Sir William Whyte and is located at the junction of Highway 9 and Highway 229 on the southwestern shore of Lake Winnipeg, about north of Winnipeg. It is bordered by the Rural Municipality of Gimli, the Rural Municipality of St. Andrews, and Dunnottar as well as Lake Winnipeg. Nearby towns are Ponemah, Whytewold, and Matlock (all to the south), Gimli, and Sandy Hook, (located to the north), as well as Teulon, and Selkirk. Its permanent population is 1,145 (as of 2016). History In 1900, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) purchased of undeveloped shoreline 65 kilometres north of Winnipeg on the southwestern shore of Lake Winnipeg and commenced construction of a resort town. In addition to the attraction of a three kilometre stretch of sandy beach, the CPR also built and offered an array of accommodation, recreation, and amusement facilities, including a prominent dance hall. In the early 1900s, ritzy hotels lined the main street of Winnipeg Beach. Piers, parks and picnic grounds were constructed to accommodate the weekend masses that would travel to Winnipeg Beach from the nearby capital city. By 1913, the summer retreat had become so popular that the CPR had 13 trains running the line between the beach and the City of Winnipeg. The famous Moonlight Special returned to the city at midnight every Saturday for fifty years. The round trip fare was only fifty cents.Vintage postcard of the wooden roller coaster at Winnipeg Beach. A boardwalk took strollers along the beach to the carnival concessions and cottages. A wooden roller coaster was one of the largest in the country at the time and carried hundreds of passengers on a busy day. The Pavilion housed a dance floor, reputed to be the largest in Western Canada. The romance of Winnipeg Beach began to wane during the 1950s, and although the beach itself still remained a popular destination, in 1964 the amusement park was permanently closed. Water tower Old CPR water tower, lettered for the TV series Falcon Beach Of the many recreation and railway related structures erected by the CPR at Winnipeg Beach, only the steel water tower survives. It was designed and constructed in 1928 by the Vulcan Iron Works Ltd. of Winnipeg. Utilitarian in design and appearance, the tower supported a capacity tank and provided a source of pressurized water for the CPR steam locomotives and fire protection services for the resort's facilities. Non-operational since the resort closed, the structure is the best example of only five surviving riveted-steel water towers in Manitoba. As in its heyday, the tower is a prominent visual landmark in and around the beach community. Today left After the closure of the resort and amusement facilities at Winnipeg Beach, the Province of Manitoba attempted to revitalize the town by creating a recreation park, Winnipeg Beach Provincial Park, in the 1960s, with various improvements to the beach and the parks lining it. A restaurant and lounge and several change-room structures were built, in addition to a large parking lot. The recreation park continues to be a popular destination for beachgoers. The Town has also built a skateboarding park, to stimulate the youth community. The Global Television Network TV series Falcon Beach was filmed in the town during the summers of 2005‚Äì2006. Several different residential summer camps, including Camp Massad of Manitoba, lie just north of the town. The town is governed by a mayor (currently Tony Pimentel) and a five-member town council.

Life He received a B.A. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (1992) from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a Ph.D. in Biochemistry (1999) from Stanford University. Joseph DeRisi is currently a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator and a Professor and Chairman of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) with a joint appointment at the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3). DeRisi's best-known achievements are printing the first whole genome expression array (), performing the first broad analysis of differential gene expression in cancer cells (), profiling gene expression throughout the lifecycle of the malaria-causing protozoan Plasmodium falciparum, his discovery of the SARS virus, and pioneering virus discovery using gene hybridization array and DNA sequencing technologies (). Joe is also known for tackling any \\"cool problem\\" whatsoever, which generally come in the form of biological questions complicated by obstacles not surmountable without invention of new protocols and techniques. DeRisi uses microarrays extensively in his work, and has designed and built both hardware and software for microarrays. He is a proponent of open access to microarray technology, and maintains a website with software and protocols for microarray operations. He is also a proponent of open access publishing, and has publications in the Public Library of Science journals. DeRisi has identified putative disease- causing viruses in humans (cancer, SARS, other respiratory infections, etc.), and animals ranging from parrots and cockatiels to honeybees and boa constrictors. He and a research partner, Don Ganem, have identified a parasite, Nosema ceranae, that appears to be responsible for colony collapse among honeybees. He has also de-bunked the relation of viruses to certain subsets of human cancer. Perhaps most relevant to contemporary global health, based on extensive characterization of the malaria-causing pathogen, Plasmodium falciparum, DeRisi's group has developed profoundly promising candidate drugs to cure malaria and a model for a vaccine to prevent malaria. In 2004 DeRisi was named a MacArthur fellow (the \\"Genius\\" award), in 2008 was awarded the 14th Annual Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy, and Employment, and in 2014 he received the John J. Carty Award for the Advancement of Science from the National Academy of Sciences. In 2016 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.. He was involved in the development of the ViroChip, which is used to rapidly identify viruses in bodily fluids. It was used to help identify the Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus in 2003. He has also been involved in the development of an online platform called IDseq, backed by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative which is used to identify viruses from metagenomic sequencing data.

Three of the album's songs were covered by Nirvana (as the Kirkwood brothers joined them onstage) during their \\"Unplugged\\" show for MTV (\\"Plateau\\", \\"Oh, Me\\", and \\"Lake of Fire\\"). Reception Kurt Loder in an April 1984 review in Rolling Stone described Meat Puppets II as \\"one of the funniest and most enjoyable albums\\" of the year, feeling that the band had developed beyond thrash music to become \\"a kind of cultural trash compacter\\" in which they blend head-banging with \\"a bit of the Byrds...Hendrix-style guitar...and...Blonde on Blonde-style wordsmithing\\". In his review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau felt that Curt Kirkwood had combined \\"the amateur and the avant-garde with a homely appeal\\", which resulted in a \\"calmly demented country music\\" in a \\"psychedelic\\" vein.

The earlier conflict restarted after the truce between the two kings expired (just long enough to see the harvest in, according to the chronicler Roger of Hoveden). Both kings invaded and pillaged the other's territory, causing great suffering to the local population by having their captives' eyes put out. Richard advanced through French territory by capturing several castles, most notably, the castle of Courcelles (of which the imposing unique oval donjon remains) and the stronghold at Burris. The French king tried to recapture Courcelles as he marched from Mante with 300 knights and a gathering of footsoldiers and citizens. The two forces met, after the Frankish army ‚Äî which was superior in numbers ‚Äî changed directions and advanced towards Gisors. The Anglo-Normans defeated the French and captured many prominent knights, as well as riderless horses. The French fled the field by crossing the bridge at the town of Gisors, which broke down under their weight, \\"and the king of France, as we have heard say, had to drink of the river\\" Richard reported to the Bishop of Durham; with the French king struggling for his life, his troops managed to pull him out of the water. The impregnable fortress of Gisors remained in French hands, nevertheless. The battle was followed by another temporary truce, made at Vernon. Allegedly, before Gisors, Richard coined as countersign the parole of the day to tell friend from foe, \\"Dieu et mon droit\\", a denial of his fealty to the King of France. By this motto, Richard attested that he owed his kingdom‚Äîand Normandy, Aquitaine, and Anjou‚Äîto God and his right alone. External links * The Annals of Roger of Hoveden (London, 1853), Henry T.

His career spanned the 1950s to 2018. Best known for regional hits recorded with Ernie Young's Nashville-based Excello Records, Lester also contributed to songs recorded by other Excello artists, including Slim Harpo, Lightnin' Slim, and Katie Webster. Cover versions of his songs have been recorded by (among others) the Kinks, the Flamin' Groovies, Freddy Fender, Dwight Yoakam, Dave Edmunds, Raful Neal, Anson Funderburgh, and the Fabulous Thunderbirds. In the comeback stage of his career (since the late 1980s) he recorded new albums backed by Mike Buck, Sue Foley, Gene Taylor, Kenny Neal, Lucky Peterson, and Jimmie Vaughan. Biography Lester started playing the guitar around age 11 and began performing in his teens around Baton Rouge with Raful Neal, later cofounding the Rhythm Rockers. In the mid-1950s, Lester was on the margins of the Louisiana blues scene. According to Rolling Stone (February 23, 2006), Buddy Guy, before moving to Chicago, had played in Louisiana \\"with some of the old masters: Lightnin' Hopkins, Lazy Lester, Slim Harpo.\\" When Guy left for Chicago, in 1957, Lester replaced him, on guitar, in a local band--even though Lester, at the time, did not own one. Lester's career took off when he found a seat next to Lightnin' Slim on a bus transporting Slim to an Excello recording session. At the studio, the scheduled harmonica player did not appear. Slim and Lester spent the afternoon unsuccessfully trying to find him, when Lester volunteered that he could play the harmonica. Lester's work on that first Lightnin' Slim session led the producer, Jay Miller, to record Lester as solo artist and also to use him as a multi-instrumentalist on percussion, guitar, bass, and harmonica in sessions headlined by other artists whose recordings were produced by Miller, including, notably, Slim Harpo. \\"Percussion\\" on these sessions went beyond the traditional drum kit and included a rolled-up newspaper striking a cardboard box. Miller dubbed Lester \\"Lazy Lester\\" because of his laconic, laid-back style. More than his vocal delivery, Lester is best remembered for songs that were later covered by a wide range of rock, country, blues, and Tex-Mex stars, chiefly, \\"I'm a Lover Not a Fighter,\\" \\"I Hear You Knockin',\\" and \\"Sugar Coated Love.\\" Lester stated that he wrote these songs, but almost all are credited to Miller or to Lester and Miller. Lester also stated he received few royalties, which embittered him and made him skeptical of the music industry. By the late 1960s, he had given up on the music industry, working manual labor and pursuing his favorite hobby--fishing. Lester moved to Pontiac, Michigan, living with Slim Harpo's sister. In 1971, Fred Reif set up a Lightnin' Slim concert at the University of Chicago Folk Festival, and Lester was brought up from Louisiana to accompany him. A few weeks after that performance, Lester was back in Louisiana. Years later Reif and Lester were both in Michigan, from where Reif orchestrated a comeback. Lester recorded and played around the United States and abroad, backed by blues bands, including, frequently, Loaded Dice. Lester's recordings in this period were on blues labels Alligator and Telarc, alongside releases in Europe. If disenchanted, Lester retained his harmonica, guitar, and vocal talents (the songwriting that had been muse to the Kinks and Dwight Yoakam having dried up long before). In September 2002, he was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Boston Blues Society. In 2003, Martin Scorsese included Lester in his blues tribute concert at Radio City Music Hall, a record of which was released as the film and album Lightning in a Bottle. The group photograph inside the album depicted Lester grinning, dead- center among peers and musical progeny including B.B. King, Solomon Burke, Clarence \\"Gatemouth\\" Brown, Buddy Guy, Levon Helm, Chuck D, the Neville Brothers, Dr. John, John Fogerty, and Aerosmith. He continued to perform nationally and abroad into 2018, often returning to Louisiana where he regularly shared the stage with Lil' Buck Sinegal, Carol Fran, and Kenny Neal. Lester appeared and performed in a television commercial aired nationally for Geico Insurance in 2018. Lester lived in Paradise, California, with his girlfriend. He appeared in the 2015 documentary film I Am the Blues.\\"Here Are 6 Must-See Music Films at Hot Docs\\". Exclaim!, April 19, 2016. Lester died of cancer on August 22, 2018, at the age of 85.

The album is unlike their later, better-known releases due to its hardcore punk sound. The album was recorded in a matter of days, there are very few overdubs and many of the tracks are first takes. Like other early SST albums the sound quality is rather spotty; there is noticeable fuzz in the background of the music. The band opted for this because they felt more comfortable recording live with only a few microphones rather than employing conventional studio separation techniques. In 1999, Curt Kirkwood stated, \\"The first [album] was our LSD record. We were three days in the studio, and we tripped the whole time. And it was really cool, and really trying, too, because we went insane.\\" The 1999 Rykodisc reissue features the entire In a Car EP as well as 13 other bonus tracks, many of them studio jams or outtakes, and a video clip of the band performing \\"Walking Boss\\" live. The booklet also has liner notes by Gregg Turkington and recording notes by drummer Derrick Bostrom. In the 2012 book, Too High to Die: Meet the Meat Puppets by Greg Prato, an entire chapter is dedicated to Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil explaining why Meat Puppets is one of his favorite all-time albums.

During its heyday, primarily between 1895 and 1900, it produced $13.5 million in gold. History The Delamar Lode newspaper office, 1890s In 1889, prospectors John Ferguson and Joseph Sharp discovered gold around Monkeywrench Wash. A mining camp was established west of the Monkeywrench Mine. It was called Ferguson. In April 1894, Captain Joseph Raphael De Lamar bought most of the important mines in the area and renamed the Ferguson camp as Delamar. In the same year, a newspaper called the Delamar Lode began publication and a post office was opened. From 1895 to 1900, Delamar was the primary ore producer in Nevada. The new settlement had more than 3000 residents by 1897. The town provided a hospital, an opera house, churches, a school, several businesses and saloons. Most buildings were made of native rock. By 1896, the Delamar mill was handling up to 260 tons of ore daily. Water for the camp was pumped from a well in Meadow Valley Wash, some twelve miles away. Supplies and materials traveled even further, by mule team over mountainous terrain from the railroad head at Milford, Utah, which was 150 miles from Delamar. The town was almost entirely destroyed by fire in the spring of 1900. In 1902, Captain De Lamar sold his mines which had produced $8.5 million in gold. The new owners installed a new 400-ton mill in 1903. The mine eventually discontinued operations in 1909.A town revival from 1929 to 1934 included the reopening of the post office (March 1933) and school. The post office closed in February 1941. Today, there are few reminders of the town. Many stone ruins stand semi-intact in the area. Mining foundations can easily be seen from adjacent hills. There are two graveyards, which have been vandalized. The area is honeycombed with mines and mine shafts, but in recent years the main shaft has been blasted closed. Wild horses roam the area. The nearby dry lake is known to pilots as Texas Lake, because its outline resembles the state of Texas. Silicosis The gold in the Delamar mines was embedded in quartzite, which created a fine dust when crushed. Miners breathing the dust often developed silicosis and the town became known as a \\"widow-maker.\\" See also * Delamar Dry Lake * Delamar Mountains Further reading James W.

Ltd., later known as Pentax Corporation, between 1964 and 1976. All Pentax Spotmatics used the M42 screw-thread lens mount which was developed before WWII by Zeiss and Praktica. Asahi Optical used the name Takumar for their lenses. These were high-quality, progressively improved lenses, later versions of which featured multi-coating and were called Super Multi Coated Takumars. The camera allowed one to focus the lens at maximum aperture with a bright viewfinder image. After focusing, a switch on the side of the lens mount stopped the lens down and switched on the metering which the camera displayed with a needle located on the side of the viewfinder. The use of stop-down light metering was at the time revolutionary, but it limited the capability of the lightmeter, especially in low light situations. Later models Spotmatic F, Electro Spotmatic, ES, and ESII were capable of open-aperture metering when used with Super Multi Coated (S-M-C) Takumar lenses with an aperture coupling prong in the lens mount. Honeywell was the U.S. importer of the Spotmatic. Cameras officially imported by Honeywell were labeled Honeywell Pentax, instead of Asahi Pentax. The Spotmatic IIa was only available as a Honeywell Pentax; it was sold exclusively in the USA and had an electronic interface for specific Honeywell Strobonar electronic flash units.  History  The original 1964 Spotmatic was one of the first SLRs on the market to offer a through-the-lens (TTL) exposure metering system. The camera was presented as a prototype at photokina 1960, and was originally designed to use spot metering. Shortly before production Asahi decided that spot metering would be too difficult to use, and so the metering system was altered to use center-weighted average metering. The change took place too close to production to change the name, and so Spotmatic stuck.http://www.photoethnography.com/ClassicCameras/index- frameset.html?AsahiPentaxSpotmatic.html~mainFramehttp://www.camerarepair.com/Used- Cameras/Pentax-SM-C210/Bodies-C212/Asahi-Pentax-Spotmatic-SP-Honeywell-Pentax- Spotmatic-P122/ The camera had a mechanical shutter with speed range from 1000 to 1 and Bulb. The lightmeter is activated by a lever on the side of the camera, which also stopped down the lens. Mercury battery (1.35 V Mallory RM640) was used to power the light metering system; however due to the way the circuit is designed, silver oxide batteries can be used instead.http://www.pentax-manuals.com/markroberts/nat_cam_spii.pdf Pentax Spotmatic Pentax Spotmatic Pentax Spotmatic Model Range and variations The model range includes the original Spotmatic (SP), which had an accessory \\"cold\\" shoe for flash Two budget models: the SP500 and SP1000 were also available and some features from the original Spotmatic were removed. The fastest shutter speeds were designated by the model number, the SP500 having a top speed of 1/500 s and the SP1000 having a top speed of 1/1000 s. These two models had no self-timer. There was also the Pentax SL, which was identical to the Spotmatic except that it did not have the built-in light meter. The Spotmatic II (SPII) heralded the arrival of the SMC lenses. Among some improvements were better metering system (Max ASA was increased to 3200) and film transport. A hot shoe for flash was added and the synchronization (FP or X) was placed on a dial switch located below the rewind crank. Spotmatic IIa camera Pentax Spotmatic IIa Spotmatic IIa was made exclusively for the American market. It was made to couple with the Honeywell Strobonar electronic flashes using an electronic eye that was located at the top-left of the camera. Electro Spotmatic In 1971 the Electro-Spotmatic was the first aperture-priority, electronic, automatic SLR but was only sold in Japan.AOHC It success was followed by the ES sold internationally from 1972. The ES had standardized and improved circuitry that addressed reliability issues in the original version.Cecchi 1990, Asahi Pentax and Pentax SLR 35 mm Cameras 1952‚Äì1989, Hove Collectors Books Two years later it was followed by the ES II. Special models could be special ordered with accessories such as Motor Drive, Data Back, etc. In 1973 the Spotmatic F joined the line. This camera, together with a revamped line of Super Multi Coated (S-M-C) Takumar had the capability of metering without stopping the lens down.

History The RECCO rescue technology was developed in response to an avalanche tragedy that involved the inventor, Magnus Granhed, in √Öre, Sweden, in 1973. He was riding the ski lift to the M√∂rvikshummeln when he heard a tremendous roar. An avalanche had ripped down the very steep slopes of Svartberget. The result was chaos. Nobody knew how many people, or who, had been swept away in its path. ‚ÄúWe started to search with our ski poles,‚Äù recalls Magnus. Later, probes and avalanche rescue dogs arrived, but in those days that was the only help available. Magnus remembers feeling ‚Äúutterly helpless poking a ski pole into the snow‚Äù in an area the size of two soccer fields. By the time they found the two buried skiers the search had gone on for hours and both skiers had died. The accident in √Öre set him thinking about the possibility of an electronic locating device to locate buried people. Granhed had just graduated with a Master of Science degree and turned to Professor Bengt Enander, Department of Electromagnetic Theory at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. After some testing, they saw that thermal imaging did not work and transceivers were too limited. It led Magnus to come up with the concept of a passive reflector that could be carried by a skier at all times and would be a simple and practical solution. During the winter of 1978-1979, Magnus worked together with the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, testing radio frequency penetration of snow. All winter, radio waves were sent into the snow, and by varying the frequencies every few hours an optimum frequency for penetration of the snowpack was arrived at. It took Enander‚Äôs team another two years to develop a harmonic radar that could be used to detect passive reflectors. Magnus formed RECCO AB in 1983 and soon created the first prototype, and although it was heavy and cumbersome, it worked. In 1987, a woman was localised with the RECCO rescue technology from a helicopter in Lenzerheide, Switzerland. She was the first live rescue found with the RECCO rescue technology. , the active part of the RECCO rescue technology utilizes a small hand-held detector, which can easily be carried by one rescuer traveling on foot or from a helicopter. These detectors are now standard equipment with more than 900 ski resorts, mountain rescue teams, and parks worldwide. In 2015, RECCO introduced the SAR-1 helicopter detector that expands the use of technology from avalanches to finding a missing person lost in the outdoors (mountains, forest...). How it works Integrated RECCO reflector on a jacket The RECCO rescue technology consists of two parts: a reflector (integrated into clothing, boots, helmets, and body protection) and a detector (used by professional rescue teams). left  The RECCO reflector  RECCO reflector integrated in the pants The reflector is a small (13 mm √ó 51 mm √ó 1.5 mm), light (4g) and they consist of a diode and an antenna. The reflector is a passive transponder, meaning it requires no batteries or activation. RECCO collaborates with more than 150 brands to integrate the RECCO rescue reflectors into their outdoor gears. Outdoors enthusiasts can thus equip themselves with products integrating reflectors such as ski boots, helmets, hiking shoes, jackets, pants and backpacks.  The RECCO handheld detector  The detector sends out a highly directional signal and if the signal ‚Äòhits‚Äô a reflector it bounces back, the returned signal is translated into an audio tone if the detector is pointed in the direction of a reflector. Judging from the audio tone a trained professional can determine the location of a buried victim. Due to the diode, the returned signal is doubled in frequency - harmonic radar. RECCO's newest, 9th generation, detector (R9) was released in 2009. The detector is the size of a school book and weighs 900 grams allowing for easy handling, and transportation. The signal sent from the RECCO detector passes through the air, snow, and ice. Its maximal range is up to 20 meters through the snow. Signal's range through snow is dependent on snow's dryness since liquid water absorbs the signal. Rescuers need to make slight adjustments to their search tactics when searching in wet snow conditions. It is equipped with an avalanche transceiver which allows a single rescuer to perform both the search for RECCO reflectors and avalanche beacons at the same time. Rescue application= Avalanche rescue  Many mountain rescues and ski patrols are equipped with the RECCO detectors in the world. The professional rescue teams use RECCO detectors as an electronic search method in addition to the avalanche transceiver to find victims in an avalanche. The search with the RECCO detector is very similar to that of an avalanche beacon. The avalanche debris area is searched in 20 meter wide corridors. The detector can be used by a rescuer on foot, skis, or from a helicopter who aims the detector toward the snow. Once a signal is heard the operator orients the detector in the direction of the strongest signal and follows the tone along a straight line. The detector is then aimed downwards at the snow and several rapid crisscross sweeps are done to pinpoint the signal. Unlike an avalanche beacon, the RECCO detector is truly directional and accurately pinpoints the location. A probe pole is recommended to determine the burial depth. RECCO SAR helicopter detector  Outdoor rescue  The RECCO SAR helicopter detector is designed for a large-scale search of missing persons in open terrain and used by professional rescue teams. In order to be located by the signal of the detector, one has to be equipped with a RECCO rescue reflector. With a search corridor up to 100 meters wide 1 square kilometer can be searched in about 6 minutes, which equals 30 football fields a minute. This search device makes it easier to search and find any outdoor sports enthusiasts equipped with RECCO rescue reflectors and practicing any outdoors activities, from skiers to hikers, mountain bikers, and climbers, in case of an avalanche or if lost in the outdoors. Capabilities The RECCO rescue technology is not intended for companion rescue and is not a substitute to transceiver used in the backcountry. The RECCO detector is another tool for organized rescue teams that complements their other search methods including rescue dogs, transceivers, and probe lines. The system was originally developed for use at ski resorts where it is already recognized to be extremely valuable for ski- resort-based rescue teams and ski patrols. However, its value is not confined only to ski resorts. Even in the backcountry, RECCO has demonstrated its capability to find buried victims quickly. Time is the enemy of all buried avalanche victims, and devices and technologies that can significantly reduce search times can make a difference for buried victims. Transceivers, RECCO, and dogs are all much faster than probe lines. The June 2016 issue of the Journal of Wilderness and Environmental Medicine presents the case report of a live rescue of a buried off-piste skier using RECCO equipment that occurred in Spain 2015. Other applications The RECCO technology has gained popularity among researchers of some amphibian species, especially tropical frogs. The system allows researchers to track small frogs in their natural habitat. It \\"is enabling scientists to begin unraveling the complex world of small- amphibian behavior in the hope that better understanding will improve conservation.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Recco AB Website Category:Rescue equipment Category:Skiing in Sweden Category:Avalanche safety Category:Mountaineering equipment Category:1983 establishments in Sweden ","title":"RECCO"},{"id":"3812907","text":"Chantal Claret Euringer (born February 21, 1982) is an American singer- songwriter.

However, it is also argued, along with certain evidence certain that Nautam Swami of Vadtal, had framed Ajendraprasadji via bribing the alleged persons involved and other evidence of corrupt acts were also seized by the CBI, however he was released due to unknown reasons. Ajendraprasadji was cleared of all these allegations in November 2016. Elections in the past also contributed for Ajendraprasad to come back into his former position, yet it is said that conspiracy and corruption also made sure such results were hidden and made sure that this did not occur. Ajendraprasad and his following have clarified that such elections should also not exists in this holy fellowship and that they should be done away with altogether. Therefore, many of the sect followers regard Ajendraprasadji as acharya. Ajendraprasad is present in Vadtals Raghuveer Vadi; however, the courts are still unclear as to the genuine acharya. The followers of Ajendraprasad declare that according to the tenets of Swaminarayan an acharya cannot be disposed of. They are on the seat of Swaminarayan and the opposition via court, too has not yet come across any evidence from the works and scriptures of Swaminarayan to back up the claim that acharyas can be disposed of. If anything the scriptures do however declare that all are to abide in their acharyas and that they shall not quarrel with the acharyas nor take them to court. Today, the court case of Acharya of Vadtal Gadi is still pending Swaminarayan Gadi The gadi was established by Swaminarayan and He appointed Raghuvirji Maharaj the first Acharya of Laxminarayandev gadi. Lord Swaminarayan ordered his devotees whether monks or householders to obey their Acharya. Vadtal gadi is also known as Lakshminarayandev gadi and dakshin desh gadi. Rakeshprasadji was elected by satsang mahasabha as an acharya of Laxminarayan dev gadi. Swaminarayan never stated that the temples can dispose or elect the head of diocese at their will, but rather previous acharya were to select oncoming acharya. He is the only one to claim acharya status against the will of Swaminarayan known as Desh Vibhag Lekh. Rakeshprasadji has interests in Sanskrit and Prakrit literature on religion, and that he has established temples and consecrated idols in them. (primary source) They also say he has given Diksha to more than 450, as per the wish of Swaminarayan who mentioned this in the Desh Vibhag Lekh. Sadhu's under him have been charged of multiple crimes such as theft, corruption, and rape.

According to group co-founder Delphine Djiraibe, following the rebellion by Idriss D√©by that overthrew the dictatorship of Hiss√®ne Habr√© in 1990, she and several colleagues returned to Chad from abroad and saw widespread starvation and poverty among the people. The event motivated them to found the ATDPH to prevent similar suffering in the future. Report on use of child soldiers ATPDH president and lawyer Jacqueline Moudeina accuses the current Chadian government of forcing minors into the Chadian military and using them \\"as human shields ... We have lots of information to back this up, including testimony from witnesses who have managed to escape...

The women had hoped to give the French ambassador a petition demanding new elections. Recognition In 2004, the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights presented Djiraibe the Robert F.

Israel National Trail on Google Street View. History  The Israel National Trail (INT) is the brainchild of Avraham Tamir a journalist and hiker who hiked the Appalachian Trail in the late 70's and Ori Dvir, hiker, educator and one of the founders of The Society for Protection of Nature in Israel (SPNI). The INT is over 1000 kilometers long and is marked, managed and maintained by The Israel Trails Committee which also blazes, marks and maintains the 15,000 kilometers of hiking trails all over Israel. The Israel National Trail was officially inaugurated by then President of Israel, Ezer Weizmann in 1994. One of its purposes is to give Israelis a way to experience the entire breadth of the land firsthand. The various sections of the trail have been added progressively during this development. Route of Israel National Trail In 2003 a portion of the trail was diverted from the Sharon and now runs along the coast. The reasons for the change were the development of Highway 6, avoiding the security risk of walking along the Green Line and the desire to add to the trail sections with city and sea views. According to statistics compiled in 2010, only 4 out of 10 hikers complete the entire trail. Recognizing this, the planners divided it into smaller sections that can be hiked separately. Some sections can be completed in day trips or over the weekend.Hiking the Israel Trail Because the southern section of the trail passes through many isolated areas, hikers cache supplies of food and water at designated points on the trail before beginning the hike or pay for supplies to be delivered. Hikers can seek help from \\"trail angels\\". For example, at Kibbutz Yagur, a soldier leaves the key to her room for hikers who need a place to sleep and a farmer in Hadera forest offers sleeping quarters in exchange for a day's work. Awards and recognition In 2012, National Geographic magazine included the trail on its best hiking trail list. It was praised for \\"connecting to something that often gets lost in all the headlines: the sublime beauty of the wilderness of the Middle East.\\" According to the magazine, \\"the joy of the trail is meeting the Israelis hiking it, and spending some time in small kibbutzim where local people take hikers into their homes.\\"National Geographic names Israel National Trail as one of world's best, Haaretz Sections  Hikers on Israel Trail The Israel National Trail may be described in sections as follows. Sand Mountains of the Negev in southern Israel Coast of Mediterranean Eastern part of Wadi Dishon Naftali Ridge and Ramim Cliffs (Upper Galilee) On the eastern slopes of the Ramim Cliffs (Matzoc Ramim) in the Upper Galilee are several dirt roads and walking routes, springs and observation points overlooking the Hula Valley. The Israel National Trail is marked here by afforestation roads and views of planted forests and natural undergrowth. The area ranges from a deserted sandstone quarry above Kiryat Shmona, at the height of 280m above sea level, southward towards Yesha Fortress (Metzudat Yesha). In the autumn, the trail is rich with rain- forecasting flowers, especially types of crocus and early blossoming cyclamens. Kadesh Ili stream and Yesha fortress (Upper Galilee) The bottom of the canyon is hard limestone, and the path lies in the shadow of the treetop canopy. (Note: The lower part of Kadesh Stream (Nakhal Kadesh) is for fit walkers only.) Elsewhere along the Kadesh Stream, hikers can climb rock steps up the stream's southern bank to view the ravine from above. The trail continues to Yesha Fortress, to the burial structure of Nebi Yusha and on to the exit point. Meron stream's parking lot to Ein Zeved and Shema ruins (Upper Galilee) Elijah's Chair on Mount Meron A circular trail on the eastern slopes of Mount Meron. The trail climbs upwards from the parking lot through Meron Stream and Meron Ili Stream, Ein Zeved, \\"Elijah's Chair\\" (Kisse Eliyahu, a pillar of rock resembling the shape of a seat), the Shema ruins and back to the parking lot. Part of the trail has regular trail marks and the walk down past Elijah's Chair has Israel National Trail marks only. During spring you can see a variety of rich blossoms including orchids. Towards summer, different flowers appear and color the area yellow. The raspberry fruit ripens at the end of the summer. Mount Tabor (Lower Galilee) As it says in the book of Jeremiah, \\"as Tavor among mountains\\", the presence of Mount Tabor is highly visible. The trail takes hikers up the Tabor and around the monasteries on its peak, near the remains of ancient walls, corner towers, places, exposed antiquities, spring blossoms and of course, views to any direction from the sides of the mountain. The \\"mountain surrounding\\" road at half-altitude (around 250-350M above sea level) created by the Jewish National Fund provides an impressive view. Tzippori stream (Lower Galilee) The Tzippori stream (Nahal Tzippori) trail segment covers one of the geographical areas least familiar to many travelers. This area of gall oaks (known in Hebrew as \\"Alon HaTavor\\" - Tabor oak) also features birch trees and carpets of blossom in winter and spring. Along the trail are streams of flowing water, improvised water pumps, a castle named \\"The Monks Mill\\" (Takhanat HaNezirim), and the remains of another impressive gristmill at the Alil ruins (Khurbat Alil). Ma'apilim/Nakhash stream (Carmel) A walk through Nakhash Stream provides an almost complete representation of the Carmel's hidden treasures: From the top of the trail and while walking down the ravine, you can see an impressive view of the Northern Coastal Plain and the Galilee. The path exits near Kibbutz Yagur. You can also see a vertical karstic hole, the \\"Arbutus Curve\\" (Icul HaCatlavim) and at the end of the trail, the Haganah slik (hiding place for weaponry) in Yagur. \\"Nakhash\\" means \\"snake\\" in Hebrew. The name is derived from the Arabic \\"Wadi al Hia\\". Nowadays, the stream is called \\"Nakhal Ma'apilim\\" after the illegal Jewish immigrants who secretly arrived at the Mediterranean shore during the time of the British mandate. After this part, the Israel National Trail continues through the Sharon plain, Gush Dan, and Shephelah areas, which are not mentioned among the 12 sections. Shayarot Range (Judean Mountains) The trip to the Shayarot Range (Shlukhat Shayarot) provides views down to the Coastal Plain and up to the Judean Mountains, hundreds of kilometers of mountain dirt tracks, walking routes, caves, and an abundance of flowers in the spring. The trail passes through the \\"Burma Road\\", or \\"Sheva Road\\". Here you can climb to the military posts overlooking Highway 1, the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv road, used by Palmach soldiers of the Harel Brigade in their battles on the road to Jerusalem during the Israeli War of Independence. From here there is a two-day site trip to Jerusalem via the Jerusalem Trail. Yatir ruins to Dragot Quarry This segment of the Israel National Trail goes from the Yatir ruins (Khurbat Yatir), one of the Levi cities in the land of Judea on the eastern brim of the Yatir Mountains ridge, through the Yatir Forest, the largest forest planted by the Jewish National Fund, to the Mount Amsha (Har Amasa) nature reserve, which has impressive views and unique plants. It also contains the remains of the Roman \\"freeway\\" Ma'ale Dragot. Mamshit and Mamshit Stream (Negev) The trail passes through the ancient city of Mamshit, its alleys, churches, remains of stables, houses and administrative structures. You can visit the ancient dams at Mamshit Stream's (Nakhal Mamshit) river bed, walk through the narrow canyon of the stream and see the remains of ancient agriculture. The path exits to Road 206, at the Rotem - Oron intersection.

Ibex roam free on the cliffs, and the colors of the crater change at different times of the day. Kisuy Stream and Ovda Valley (Negev) Near Ovda Valley (Bik'at Ovda) are dunes of sand as in the Sinai. Ancient remains include temples, ritual locations and interesting structures near the sides of the roads. From the modern settlement of Shakharot, there are views to the Arava desert. Shkhoret Stream (Eilat Mountains) On the route are sandstone geological formations such as the \\"Amir formation\\" and \\"Shkhoret formation\\". You can see element rocks, sorts of granite in streams (or wadis) that undermined in their predecessors' sediment walls, desert plants and perhaps even representatives of the local fauna. Different shades of sandstones, the granite and its shapes and dark colors, plaster ornaments on the rock and colors galore, all of it there in the Eilat area. The Israeli Trail is featured prominently in Israeli author David Grossman's 2008 novel \\"To the End of the Land.\\" In that story the mother of an Israeli soldier takes to the trail to occupy and distract herself while her son is engaged in a military operation.

Art by Jack Kirby and Dick Ayers. ¬© Marvel Comics. The Yancy Street Gang is a fictional street gang appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. It is occasionally featured in the Fantastic Four comic book. Publication history The Yancy Street Gang was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, and first appeared in Fantastic Four #15 (June 1963), though mostly off-panel; as in most of their appearances, only their arms are visible as they throw objects at the Thing and yell insults. The Dead End Kids type gang was first mentioned, although not seen, in Fantastic Four #6. Yancy Street is named in reference to the real Delancey Street, which extends from the Bowery in Manhattan's Lower East Side eastward to the Williamsburg Bridge. However, Yancy Street is seen in Fantastic Four #15 (June 1963) to intersect with 10th Avenue, which is on the west side of Manhattan. Fictional group history The Yancy Street Gang is depicted as frequenting downtown Manhattan, and serves as a recurring antagonist of the Thing, tormenting him for typically humorous effect. It was originally depicted as composed only of youths, but later depictions have both young members as well as adult members from an earlier generation, who have passed their grudge against the Thing to the younger members. Although described as a gang, the Yancy Streeters are rarely depicted as engaging in criminal activities (except in their harassment of the Thing, who rarely takes their actions seriously) and may be more accurately described as a circle of admittedly roughneck friends and associates who encourage neighborhood youths to divert their energies into harmlessly heckling the virtually indestructible Thing, rather than into more dangerous and illegal pursuits. The adult members of the Yancy Street Gang, all apparently blue-collar workers (many of them typically wear hardhats) who still live in the neighborhood, are often seen tormenting the Thing in some way, usually by throwing things at him and shouting abuse whenever he entered Yancy Street. They were also thought to send him booby-trapped parcels, although a retcon in Fantastic Four (vol. 3) #61, written by Mark Waid, revealed that these packages (or at least many of them) had actually been sent by the Human Torch as part of his own recurring campaign of pranks against the Thing. As a youth, Ben Grimm formerly led the gang, and the other members, who have retained their loyalty to it in adulthood, seemingly resent him for having \\"sold out\\" by leaving the neighborhood and pursuing a higher education and standard of living, culminating in his position as one of the Air Force's most accomplished pilots and, later, as a world-famous adventurer. However, they are generally portrayed as good-natured at heart and have occasionally helped the Fantastic Four if a supervillain threatens their neighborhood itself or if they think that a villain is giving the Thing too much trouble (noting on such occasions that \\"That's our job!\\"). They sometimes seem to genuinely like the Thing, if only because he makes such an effective and (sometimes) good-humored target for their pranks; they were quite remorseful when he seemingly died in action, only to quickly retract the sentiment when he proved to have survived.Marvel Two-in-One #48 (1974) Other heroes have become involved with the local life, such as when Spider-Man cleared out a Negative Zone invasion from Yancy Street and saved three residents from being lost forever.\\"Spider-Man\\" #90 (April 1998) Making peace In The Thing #6 (2006 series), the Thing's relationship with Yancy Street was finally reconciled, after the millionaire (following events in the ongoing Fantastic Four comic) Thing donates a state-of-the-art recreational facility to the neighborhood. Initially resentful because they regarded the project as an exercise in ego, they later learned that it was named in honor of the Thing's deceased brother, Daniel Grimm Jr. (another Yancy Street Gang alumnus), and they declared the facility to be under their informal protection. The facility is later seen again when Benjamin is encouraging the local youth to make use of the location, and to hit the bags instead of each other.Mighty Avengers vol. 1 #25 (July 2009). The adult Yancy Street Gang members are traditionally shown in the comics with their faces obscured by the shadows of their hardhats or other headwear. The younger \\"next generation\\" Yancy Streeters, however, have been fully seen, including in one story (Fantastic Four #361 \\"Miracle On Yancy Street!\\" by Paul Ryan & Tom DeFalco) which portrays the Gang with gimmicks and codenames similar to Kirby's DC Comics kid gangs. Civil War The Yancy Street Gang has become deeply involved during the Civil War storyline. They are part of a large group of New York citizens protesting the arresting of superheroes who do not wish to register with the United States Government. Ben Grimm becomes involved with the dispute, being asked by police forces to talk with the Gang regulars. Ben meets with Cee, a young man in a leadership position. Both Cee and the police wish for Ben to take a more active role, but he maintains his neutrality. While negotiations are going on, another gang member, Mouse, has become involved with longtime FF villains the Puppet Master and the Mad Thinker. The two men put in motion a plan that brings a superhero prisoner convoy down Yancy Street itself. Though Spider-Man recognizes the potential trouble as the convoy turns in, it is far too late.Fantastic Four #538-539 Military forces and superheroes on both sides of the Registration Act, some affected by the villains and some fighting with their own agendas, engage in a property-damaging fight. Mouse, not in control of his own mind, drops a bomb into the middle of the fight. In an effort to save lives, Ben Grimm smashes a large, empty truck onto the bomb. This effort fails, as the explosion kills Cee. Ben furiously hands Cee's body to the other gang members and shames the people involved into quitting the fighting. A later version of the Yancy Street Gang was composed of blue-collar criminals who were former dot-com start-ups, ex-Wall Street traders, and failed hedge fund managers. This Gang encountered Ben Grimm and the Human Torch during a period where the Thing briefly reverted to his human form. Despite his lack of physical strength, Ben was still able to send the Gang packing.Fantastic Four #584 (December 2010) Yancy Street was featured when a mysterious figure stealing Christmas decorations led Ben Grimm to the Yancy Street Children's Home. This interrupted Ben Grimm's plan to go a Jewish superhero dinner, but turned out well for the children, who were lacking their own dinner. The heroes shared with the children.Marvel Holiday Special One-Shot (December 2011) Fear Itself During the Fear Itself storyline, the physical Yancy Street itself is obliterated by the Thing, who was transformed into Angrir: Breaker of Souls.Heroes For Hire #9-11 (September 2011) Personal relations with heroes The Yancy Street Gang members Petey, Tony, and an unnamed member later played poker with the Thing and Gambit.A + X #6 At the time when the Fantastic Four were in space, the Yancy Street Gang took offense to Darla Deering acting as Ms. Thing where they took offense to her \\"posing\\" as the Thing. They sent one of their typical booby-trapped parcels to her hotel room after a musical performance. Darla and her teammate Ant-Man were covered in whipped cream and sparkles, while Yancy Street Gang members (who were wearing Thing masks) snapped photos of the pair before fleeing off into Times Square. They were able to get away, thanks to the New Year's Eve celebrations going on at the time, and they managed to post the embarrassing photos online.FF vol. 2 #3 The Yancy Street Gang then became more tech-savvy by including hackers Carlos Hernandez, Douglas Ray, and Jason Carter, where they hacked into the contest so that the Yancy Street Gang can be in attendance to Darla Deering's private acoustic performance. During Darla's performance, they pelted her with fruit and vegetables, forcing her to flee. However, Ant-Man stowed away on their bodies, learned the passwords to all their social media accounts and emailed all the information to their rivals in order to force them to stop harassing Darla Deering.FF vol. 2 #6 Following this incident, the hackers of the Yancy Street Gang agreed to help hack into Doctor Doom's computer database where they foiled his plans to destroy the Future Foundation alongside Annihilus and Kid Immortus.FF vol. 2 #16 The physical Yancy Street is later seen in an improved rebuilt condition when its subway system is invaded by slightly violent Killer Folk from the past.Moon-Girl and Devil Dinosaur #2 (2016) The gang was then fended off by the Killer Folk, who took over the street itself.Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #4-5 (2016) The Killer Folk were later fended off by Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur.Moon-Girl and Devil Dinosaur #6 (2016) Yancy Street is later the location of an incursion by Omnipotents, a force that eats universes.Moon-Girl and Devil Dinosaur #27-28 (2018) The Fantastic Four's move to Yancy Street, plus the intentional influence of super villains, caused the rents to spike. The safety of literally being near the Fantastic Four causes the street to become a more desirable neighborhood. Several members of the Yancy Street Gang are seen when they assist Ben Grimm in fighting the 'Terrible Trio'. This group was threatening the safety and lives of several innocent Yancy Street residents. Ultimately Reed Richards fixes the housing situation with a device that doubles the amount of apartments without altering the size of the actual apartment building.Fantastic Four: 4 Yancy Street (2019) Members * \\"Dictionary\\" Dawson - The eloquent member of the Yancy Street Gang. * \\"Lugwrench\\" Lubowski - * \\"Rhythm\\" Ruiz - * Carlos Hernandez - The Yancy Street Gang's hacker. * Douglas Ray - The Yancy Street Gang's hacker. * Jack - * Jason Carter - The Yancy Street Gang's hacker. * Larry \\"Little\\" Lee - * Manny \\"Smooth\\" Merengues - * Petey - * Stan - * Tommie \\"Two-Fisted\\" Boyd - * Tony - Former members * Cee - Member of the Yancy Street Gang.

He played a significant role in the development of Anglophone Caribbean literature both as a poet and an anthologist. He contributed to the development of the University College of the West Indies as an early member of staff, and had a parallel career as a broadcaster, working for various media organizations including the BBC. He also taught in Jamaica, Britain, the United States, Africa and Puerto Rico. Biography Figueroa was born in Jamaica, the eldest of the 13 children (10 of whom survived infancy) of Blanche Maria Palomino and Rupert Aston Figueroa.Esther Figueroa, \\"You Are Not Forgotten ‚Äì The Literary Heritage of John Figueroa\\",Caribbean Literary Heritage, 7 June 2019. He was educated at St George's College, and won a scholarship to attend Holy Cross College, Massachusetts, graduating in 1942. He then taught at St George's College and at Wolmer's School in Jamaica.Philip Nanton, \\"Wise words from the Caribbean\\" (John Figueroa obituary), The Guardian, 16 March 1999. In 1946 he went on a British Council fellowship to London University to study for a teaching diploma and a master's degree in education. He subsequently taught in some London schools, and spent six years as an English and philosophy lecturer at the Institute of Education. He also contributed criticism, stories and poetry to the BBC's Caribbean Voices radio programme produced by Henry Swanzy. In Jamaica Figueroa became the first West Indian to be appointed to a chair at the University College of the West Indies, and the first Dean of the Faculty of Education. Between 1964 and 1966 he was a visiting professor first at Rhode Island University and then Indiana University. In the early 1970s he became Professor of Humanities leading the Department of Education of the Centro Caribeno de Estudios Postgraduados, Puerto Rico. From 1976 to 1980 he was Professor of Education at the University of Jos in Nigeria. In the 1980s he moved to the UK, where he worked for the Open University, was a Fellow at the Centre for Caribbean Studies, University of Warwick, and an adviser in multicultural education in Manchester. He edited the pioneering two-volume anthology Caribbean Voices (vol. 1: Dreams and Visions and vol. 2: The Blue Horizons, 1966 and 1970 respectively), comprehensive landmark collections of West Indian poetry. He was also the first general editor of the Heinemann Caribbean Writers Series. He also played an important role in the development of Caribbean studies as a founder member of the Caribbean Studies Association and the Society for Caribbean Studies. His own poetry \\"reflects his origins as a Jamaican of [Hispanic] descent and a Catholic who, whilst deeply committed to the Caribbean, was concerned to maintain [the diversity of its] heritage without apology. He insisted that drums were not the only Caribbean musical instrument (no doubt a dig at Kamau Brathwaite) and championed Derek Walcott's relationship to the classical and European literary tradition. Ironically, one of Figueroa's most effective poems is in Nation language.\\"Peepal Tree Press website. In the words of Andrew Salkey, \\"The phrase 'cosmopolitan poet' does not really adequately describe him or the impact that he has had on Anglophone Caribbean poetry, but it certainly goes some way in defining a part of his concern in not being tagged as regional or provincial. This is so because he is absolutely free from national limitations.\\"Andrew Salkey, World Literature Today.

She now lives in Hailey, Idaho, with her husband Bob, a hunter/jumper and trainer. Debbie trains and teaches riders on Peggy and E. Parry Thomas's River Grove Farm in Sun Valley, Idaho. McDonald's first mount was an $800 pony. She agreed that she would pay for board if her parents bought it for her. Shortly thereafter Debbie managed to find a gaited horse trainer near her hometown who allowed her to groom horses and clean stalls in exchange for board. At age 14, when Debbie went to turn her pony out, she discovered a strange man in his stall, beating him. She went running for help and ran into a young trainer and her future husband, Bob McDonald, who ran a hunter/jumper farm and hired her as a stable hand. It was at this facility that she began her career. McDonald began her career in show jumping. However, she switched to dressage after a serious fall in which her horse somersaulted over her breaking ribs, rupturing her spleen, and fracturing a vertebra in her neck, She first met Parry and Peggy Thomas when she got a catch ride at a dressage show in Las Vegas on one of their horses whose rider was not available. The Thomases also became the owners of Brentina, a chestnut Hanoverian mare that became McDonald's primary mount. McDonald and her husband obtained the mare at an auction in Germany in 1994. Brentina, foaled in 1991, had a suitable temperament to respect McDonald, who is only five feet tall, and the team established a partnership that took them to the Olympics. McDonald and Brentina began by winning the Individual and Team Gold medals at the 1999 Pan American Games. In recognition of this accomplishment, McDonald was named the 1999 Equestrian of the Year by the United States Equestrian Federation and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) Female Equestrian Athlete of the Year. In 2003, McDonald become the first American rider to win the Dressage World Cup, and the pair placed third at the 2005 World Cup. As members of the United States Equestrian Team they won a team silver and team bronze at the 2002 and 2006 World Equestrian Games. At the 2004 Athens Olympics, the pair won the team bronze and were individually fourth overall, and McDonald was dubbed \\"First Lady of American Dressage.\\"By the U.S. Equestrian Federation. \\"McDonald Fourth and Dover Sixth in Dressage Individual Final\\" The Horse online edition, undated, 2004, accessed January 25, 2010 Brentina was named the 2005 Farnam/Platform USEF Horse of the Year.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Bob Clampett. The cartoon was released on April 8, 1944, and stars Porky Pig and Daffy Duck. This is a color remake of the 1937 cartoon Porky's Badtime Story, with Daffy filling the role that was previously played by Gabby Goat. A gag from Friz Freleng‚Äôs 1941 cartoon Notes to You was also resused as well. Plot The plot is largely the same as the plot of Porky's Badtime Story. When Porky Pig and Daffy Duck realize that they overslept to 10:00 after their alarm goes off at 06:00, they end up rushing to work at the Fly By Night Aircraft Co. and sneaking in. When it came to clocking in, Daffy ends up turning the clock backwards two hours earlier and clocks in, only for the alarm to go off. Their boss (a caricature of Clampett's immediate boss, production manager Ray Katz) catches them and in a cheerful manner, states that if they weren't going to make it, he would've sent their work to them. He then drops his friendly facade and angrily warns them that if they are late one more time, they'll be fired. Then he orders them to get to work, to which they dash into their office and close the door so fast that the sign on the door shatters. Later that night at 08:00, Porky sets the alarm clock as Daffy complains about having to go to bed early. Porky reminds Daffy that if they are late again, they will be fired. Porky climbs into bed and they both fall asleep until a bunch of cats and dogs next door wake them up. Later that night, the moon comes out and its light wakes up Porky. One of Porky's attempts to close the blind ends up wrecking his bed. This also disturbs Daffy who ends up grabbing a shotgun and shooting the moon, which then falls from the sky as a result. (\\"Unbelievable, isn't it?\\") As the night progresses, a thunderstorm occurs while Porky is sleeping in Daffy's bed. Porky closes the window only for a leak in the roof to disturb him and Daffy. Daffy opens an umbrella in the house with Porky telling him that it's bad luck. Daffy ignores Porky's statement until lightning destroys the umbrella. When Daffy quotes that he should try sleeping under Niagara Falls, a lot of water comes through the roof and down on them. The next morning, Porky and Daffy are shown sleeping in the drawers when the alarm clock goes off at 06:00. They get themselves ready and drive off to work. When Porky and Daffy arrive at the Fly By Night Aircraft Co., they see a sign on the door that says \\"Closed Sunday.\\" Porky states that they don't have to work today, to which Daffy boxes himself (\\"Now he tells me!\\") before they drive home. When they climb back into the drawers to sleep, the alarm clock goes off again at 06:15. It gets shot by Porky, falls over and dies.

Milbank Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton University.  Career  After receiving his BA from Manchester University, Indiana, and his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1985, Ikenberry became an assistant professor at Princeton, where he remained until 1992. He then moved to the University of Pennsylvania, where he taught from 1993 to 1999, serving as co- director of the Lauder Institute from 1994 to 1998, while since 1996 he has been Visiting Professor at the Catholic University of Milan in Italy. In 2001, he moved to Georgetown University, becoming the Peter F. Krogh Professor of Geopolitics and Global Justice in the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service. He returned to Princeton in 2004, recruited by Dean Anne-Marie Slaughter, becoming the Albert G. Milbank Professor of Politics and International Affairs in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs there. Ikenberry is also a Global Eminence Scholar at Kyung Hee University in Seoul, Korea. In 2013-2014 Ikenberry was the 72nd Eastman Visiting Professor at Balliol College, University of Oxford.Princeton University Faculty Website Ikenberry served on the State Department's Policy Planning staff from 1991 to 1992. He was a Senior Associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace from 1992 to 1993, a Fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars from 1998 to 1999, and a non-resident Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution from 1997 to 2002. He has also worked for several projects of the Council on Foreign Relations. Ikenberrry was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2016.  Criticism of U.S. policy  Ikenberry is known for vehement criticism of what he described as the \\"neoimperial grand strategy\\" of the United States under the Bush administration. His critique is primarily a pragmatic one, arguing not that the U.S. should eschew imperialism as a matter of principle, but rather, that it is not in a position to succeed at an imperial project. He contends that such a strategy, rather than enabling a successful War on Terrorism and preserving international peace, will end up alienating American allies, weakening international institutions, and provoking violent blowback, including terrorism, internationally, as well as being politically unsustainable domestically. Instead, in his article \\"The Rise of China and the Future of the West\\", Foreign Affairs, Ikenberry suggests strengthening and re- investing in the existing institutions and rules of U.S.-led western order. He argues that the first thing that U.S. must do is to reestablish itself as a foremost supporter of the global system that underpins the Western order. In this view, when other countries see the U.S. using its power to strengthen the existing rules and institutions, US authority will be strengthened because they will become more inclined to work in collaboration with U.S. power. Secondly, the U.S. should update the key post-war security pacts, such as NATO and Washington‚Äôs East Asian alliances. When the U.S. provides security, the U.S. allies, in return, will operate within the western order. Thirdly, the U.S. should renew its support for wide-ranging multilateral institutions. Economically speaking, building on the agreements of the WTO, concluding the current Doha Round of trade talks that seek to extend market opportunities and trade liberalization to developing countries are possible examples. Fourthly, the U.S. should make sure that the order is all-encompassing, meaning there shouldn‚Äôt be any space left for other rising countries to build up their own ‚Äúminilateral‚Äù order. Lastly, U.S. must support efforts to integrate rising developing countries into key global institutions. Less formal bodies, like G-20 and various other intergovernmental networks, can provide alternative avenues for voice and representation.Ikenberry, John. \\"The Rise of China and the Future of the West\\", Foreign Affairs, January/February 2008  Institutions  In After Victory: Institutions, Strategic Restraint, and the Rebuilding of Order after Major Wars, Ikenberry explores how the United States utilized its hegemony after both World Wars to shape future world order. In both cases, the U.S. attempted to institutionalize its power through the creation of a constitutional order, by which political order was organized around agreed-upon legal and political institutions that operate to allocate rights and limit the exercise of power. In the process, the United States agreed to \\"tame\\" its power by placing it within institutions and the set of rules and rights with which this came.John Ikenberry (2001). After Victory: Institutions, Strategic Restraint, and the Rebuilding of Order after Major Wars. Princeton University Press. pp.29 One of the advantages for the United States in doing so was locking itself into a guaranteed position for years to come. In the event that its power waned in the future, the institutional framework it created would nonetheless remain intactDall'Agnol, Augusto C. Vol. 7, No. 3 (2018), pp. 494-515, for critics on Ikenberry's main arguments in what relates to unipolarity after the Cold War..  The Settlement of World War I  Following World War 1, the distribution of power was greatly skewed towards the United States. President Woodrow Wilson possessed the power to set the terms of peace, and the manner in which the post-war order was constructed. He sought to do so through a model based on upholding collective security and sparking a democratic revolution across the European continent based on American ideals. Great Britain and France were worried about America's preponderance of power, and sought to tie the United States to the continent. Both sides attempted to meet at a middle ground, with European nations gaining security and financial considerations while the United States would institutionalize its power through the League of Nations and maintain its presence on the continent for decades to come. Ultimately, Woodrow Wilson's envisioned order encountered major obstacles, including the failure of the United States to join the League of Nations. Furthermore, the imposition of war guilt and stiff penalties on Germany through the terms set by the Treaty of Versailles set in place conditions favorable for Hitler to rise to power.  The Settlement of World War II  Compared to the end of the first World War, the United States was even more powerful in 1945 following the conclusion of the second World War. The nation possessed a preponderance of military power and close to half of the world's wealth.John Ikenberry (2001). After Victory: Institutions, Strategic Restraint, and the Rebuilding of Order after Major Wars. Princeton University Press. pp.167 Once again, leaders from the United States attempted to leverage this powerful position and create a stable order that would serve to benefit their nation for decades to come. Political and economic openness was the centerpiece of this envisioned framework. It was believed that the closed economic regions which had existed before the war had led to worldwide depression and at least in part contributed to the start of the conflict. Reconstructing a stable Europe was also a priority, as safeguarding American interests was seen as being rooted in European stability. The region also became a staging ground for the Cold War, and building a strong West Germany was seen as an important step in balancing against the Soviet Union. In the end, the United States created its desired order through a series of security, economic, and financial multilateral institutions, including NATO and the Marshall Plan. West Germany was bound to its democratic Western European neighbors through the European and Coal and Steel Community (later, the European Communities) and to the United States through Atlantic security pact; Japan was bound to the United States through an alliance partnership and expanding economic ties. The Bretton Woods system meeting in 1944 laid down the monetary and trade rules that facilitated the opening and subsequent flourishing of the world economy.Ikenberry, John. \\"The Rise of China and the Future of the West\\", Foreign Affairs, January/February 2008 In institutionalizing its power, the United States was willing to act as a \\"reluctant superpower,\\" making concessions to weaker states in order to ensure their participation in their desired framework.John Ikenberry (2001). After Victory: Institutions, Strategic Restraint, and the Rebuilding of Order after Major Wars. Princeton University Press. pp.200 Ikenberry asserts that the dense, encompassing, and broadly endorsed system of rules and institutions, which are rooted in and also reinforced by democracy and capitalism, laid a basis of cooperation and shared authority over the current U.S.-led global system. He says that system with the institutions that were built around rules and norms of nondiscrimination and market openness, provides low barrier of economic participation and high potential benefits. However, the key point is that while making active use of these institutions to promote the country's development of global power status, the country should work within the order, rather than the outside of it. Thus, no major state can modernize without integrating into the globalized capitalist system.Ikenberry, John. \\"The Rise of China and the Future of the West\\", Foreign Affairs, January/February 2008  Bibliography  Ikenberry is the author of: *The State, University of Minnesota Press, 1989 *Reasons of State: Oil Politics and the Capacities of American Government, Cornell University Press, 1988 *After Victory: Institutions, Strategic Restraint, and the Rebuilding of Order after Major Wars, Princeton University Press, 2001 (New edition, 2019). *Liberal Order and Imperial Ambition: American Power and International Order, Polity Press, 2005 *Liberal Leviathan: The Origins, Crisis, and Transformation of the American System, Princeton University Press, 2011 He has also co-authored or edited: *The State and American Foreign Economic Policy, Cornell University Press, 1988 *New Thinking in International Relations, Westview Press, 1997 *U.S. Democracy Promotion: Impulses, Strategies, and Impacts, Oxford University Press, 2000 *State Power and the World Markets, W.W.

Created by Mark Millar, it is set in the Judge Dredd universe, fifty years after the events detailed in the current Judge Dredd comics. The series debuted in Judge Dredd Megazine #1.08, in 1991. The stories focus on a Sov- Block (formerly East-Meg Two, formerly somewhere in Russia) Judge named Razors. Judge Razors is the prototype for a new breed of Judge, a brainwashed ex-gang member, conditioned to follow the orders of his superiors without question. His partner is a genetically enhanced horse named Comrade Ed. Plot The first storyline focused on the penetration of western culture and capitalism behind the iron curtain (for example, Elvis Presley is worshipped as a God). The storyline can be thought of as a satirical comment on Russia's current integration of western elements with its own culture. Subsequent entries were much more action-oriented, with little or no satire. Cameos in the series have included Judge Dredd. In his last appearance, Razors threw off his brainwashing and went on a killing spree, which ended when he was shot and killed by Dredd. Also there are obvious references in the series to other series (TV especially.) The main example is Comrade Ed, Razor's partner which is an obvious \\"take off\\" of Mister Ed, the talking horse.

Swaminarayan (IAST: ', 3 April 1781 ‚Äì 1 June 1830), also known as Sahajanand Swami, was a yogi and ascetic whose life and teachings brought a revival of central Hindu practices of dharma, ahimsa and brahmacarya. He is believed by followers to be a manifestation of God. Swaminarayan was born Ghanshyam Pande in Chhapaiya, Uttar Pradesh, India in 1781. In 1792, he began a 7-year pilgrimage across India at the age of 11 years, adopting the name Nilkanth Varni. During this journey, he did welfare activities and after 9 years and 11 months of this journey, he settled in the modern-day Indian state of Gujarat around 1799. In 1800, he was initiated into the Uddhav sampradaya by his guru, Swami Ramanand, and was given the name Sahajanand Swami. In 1802, his guru handed over the leadership of the Uddhav Sampraday to him before his death. Sahajanand Swami held a gathering and taught the Swaminarayan Mantra. From this point onwards, he was known as Swaminarayan. The Uddhav Sampraday became known as the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. Swaminarayan developed a good relationship with the British Raj. He had followers not only from Hindu denominations but also from Islam and Zoroastrianism. He built six temples in his lifetime and appointed 500 paramahamsas to spread his philosophy. In 1826, Swaminarayan wrote the Shikshapatri, a book of social principles. He died on 1 June 1830 and was cremated according to Hindu rites in Gadhada, Gujarat. Before his death, Swaminarayan appointed his adopted nephews as acharyas to head the two dioceses of Swaminarayan Sampradaya. Swaminarayan is also remembered within the sect for undertaking reforms for women and the poor, and performing non- violent yaj√±as (fire sacrifices) on a large scale. Childhood as Ghanshyam Dharmadev teaching Ghanshyam from the scriptures Swaminarayan was born on 3 April 1781 (Chaitra Sud 9, Samvat 1837) in Chhapaiya, Uttar Pradesh, a village near Ayodhya, in a Hindi speaking region in India. Born into the brahmin or priestly caste of Sarvariya, Swaminarayan was named Ghanshyam Pande by his parents, Hariprasad Pande (father, also known as Dharmadev) and Premvati Pande (mother, also known as Bhaktimata and Murtidevi). The birth of Swaminarayan coincided with the Hindu festival of Rama Navami, celebrating the birth of Rama. The ninth lunar day in the fortnight of the waxing moon in the month of Chaitra (March‚ÄìApril), is celebrated as both Rama Navami and Swaminarayan Jayanti by Swaminarayan followers. This celebration also marks the beginning of a ritual calendar for the followers. Swaminarayan had an elder brother, Rampratap Pande, and a younger brother, Ichcharam Pande. He is said to have mastered the scriptures, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Puranas, the Ramayana, and the Mahabharata by the age of seven. Travels as Nilkanth Varni Nilkanth Varni during his travels After the death of his parents, Ghanshyam Pande left his home on 29 June 1792 (Ashadh Sud 10, Samvat 1849) at the age of 11. He took the name Nilkanth Varni while on his journey. Nilkanth Varni travelled across India and parts of Nepal in search of an ashram, or hermitage, that practiced what he considered a correct understanding of Vedanta, Samkhya, Yoga, and Pancaratra, the four primary schools of Hindu philosophy. To find such an ashram, Nilkanth Varni asked the following five questions on the basic Vaishnava Vedanta categories: * What is '? * What is '? * What is '? * What is '? * What is '? While on his journey, Nilkanth Varni mastered Astanga yoga (eightfold yoga) in a span of nine months under the guidance of an aged yogic master named Gopal Yogi. In Nepal, it is said that he met King Rana Bahadur Shah and cured him of his stomach illness. As a result, the king freed all the ascetics he had imprisoned. Nilkanth Varni visited the Jagannath Temple in Puri as well as temples in Badrinath, Rameswaram, Nashik, Dwarka and Pandharpur. In 1799, after a seven-year journey, Nilkanth's travels as a yogi eventually concluded in Loj, a village in the Junagadh district of Gujarat. In Loj, Nilkanth Varni met Muktanand Swami, a senior disciple of Ramanand Swami. Muktanand Swami, who was 22 years older than Nilkanth, answered the 5 questions to Nilkanth's satisfaction. Nilkanth decided to stay for the opportunity to meet Ramanand Swami, whom he met a few months after his arrival in Gujarat. He later claimed in the Vachnamrut that during this period, he took up a severe penance to eliminate his mother's flesh and blood from his body so that the sign of his physical attachment to family, was completely removed.  Leadership as Sahajanand Swami  Traditional iconographical portrait of Swaminarayan According to the sect, Nilkanth's understanding of the metaphysical and epistemological concepts of the pancha-tattvas (five eternal elements), together with his mental and physical discipline, inspired senior swamis of Ramanand Swami. Nilkanth Varni received sannyasa initiation from Ramanand Swami on 20 October 1800, and with it was granted the names Sahajanand Swami and Narayan Muni to signify his new status. At the age of 21, Sahajanand Swami was appointed successor to Ramanand Swami as the leader of the Uddhav Sampradaya by Ramanand Swami, prior to his death. The Uddhav Sampradaya henceforth came to be known as the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. According to sources he proclaimed the worship of one sole deity, Krishna or Narayana. Krishna was considered by him his own ista devata. In contrast with the Vaishnava sect known as the Radha-vallabha Sampradaya, he had a more puritanical approach, rather than the theological views of Krishna that are strongly capricious in character and imagery. While being a worshipper of Krishna, Swaminarayan rejected licentious elements in Krishnology in favor of worship in the mood of majesty, alike to earlier Vaisnava teachers, Ramanuja and Yamunacharya. Sahajanand Swami was later known as Swaminarayan after the mantra he taught at a gathering, in Faneni, a fortnight after the death of Ramanand Swami. He gave his followers a new mantra, known as the Swaminarayan mantra, to repeat in their rituals: Swaminarayan. When chanting this mantra, some devotees went into samadhi (a form of meditation) This act is also called maha-samadhi (\\"great samadhi\\") and claimed that they could see their personal gods, even though they had no knowledge of Astanga Yoga. Swaminarayan also became known by the names Ghanshyam Maharaj, Shreeji Maharaj, Hari Krishna Maharaj and Shri Hari. As early as 1804, Swaminarayan, who was reported to have performed miracles, was described as a manifestation of God in the first work written by a disciple and paramhansa, Nishkulanand Swami. This work, the Yama Danda, was the first piece of literature written within the Swaminarayan sect. Swaminarayan encouraged his followers to combine devotion and dharma to lead a pious life. Using Hindu texts and rituals to form the base of his organisation, Swaminarayan founded what in later centuries would become a global organisation with strong Gujarati roots. He was particularly strict on the separation of sexes in temples. Swaminarayan was against the consumption of meat, alcohol or drugs, adultery, suicide, animal sacrifices, criminal activities and the appeasement of ghosts and tantric rituals. Alcohol consumption was forbidden by him even for medicinal purposes. Many of his followers took vows before becoming his disciple. He stated that four elements need to be conquered for ultimate salvation: dharma, bhakti (devotion), gnana (knowledge) and vairagya (detachment). Doctrinally, Swaminarayan was close to eleventh century philosopher Ramanuja and was critical of Shankaracharya's concept of advaita, or monistic non-dualism. Swaminarayan's ontology maintained that the supreme being is not formless and that God always has a divine form.  Work and views =Women Swaminarayan insisted that education was the inherent right of all people, including women, despite considerable criticism from those in his own contemporary society who \\"loathed the uplift of lower caste women\\". At that time, influential and wealthy individuals educated their girls through private and personal tuition. Male followers of Swaminarayan made arrangements to educate their female family members. The literacy rate among females began to increase during Swaminarayan's time, and they were able to give discourses on spiritual subjects. Members of the sect consider Swaminarayan a pioneer of education of females in India. According to the author Raymond Brady Williams, \\"Swaminarayan is an early representative of the practice of advocacy of women's rights without personal involvement with women\\". To counter the practice of sati (self-immolation by a widow on her husband‚Äôs funeral pyre), Swaminarayan argued that, as human life was given by God it could be taken only by God, and that sati had no Vedic sanction. He went to the extent to call sati nothing but suicide. Swaminarayan offered parents help with dowry expenses to discourage female infanticide, calling infanticide a sin. For calling a halt to these prevailing practices, Swaminarayan's \\"contemporaries naturally saw in him a pioneer of a reformed and purified Hinduism, and Swaminarayan Hinduism an ‚Äòingrazi dharma‚Äô or British religion.\\" Professor David Harman observed that Swaminarayan \\"criticized the popular shakta cults and 'gosai' and 'nath' ascetics for the contemptuous and instrumental way in which they viewed and treated women. These cults were often responsible for gross sexual abuse of women.\\" Hardiman added that Swaminarayan's view towards women was not in line with this type of misogyny and was rooted in his desire to prevent ill-treatment of women along with promoting celibacy for ascetics. Swaminarayan \\"forbade all sadhus and sadhvis (that is, male and female ascetics) of his sect from having any contact whatsoever with members of the opposite sex.\\" This strict precept was one he likely internalized \\"after travelling as an ascetic throughout India [when] he was reported to vomit if approached by even the shadow of a woman\\". To help his male ascetic followers maintain their vow of celibacy, Swaminarayan taught ‚Äúthe woman who attracts attention is made up of bones, blood vessels, spittle, blood, mucus and feces; she is simply a collection of these things, and there is nothing to be attractive. Members of the faith are defensive of the fact that some practices seem to restrict women and make gender equality in leadership impossible. They are only permitted to enter special sections of the temple reserved for women or have to go to separate women's temples. As with practices of niddah in Orthodox Judaism, concepts of pollution associated with the menstrual cycle lead to the exclusion of women from the temples and daily worship during the affected time. Swaminarayan also directed male devotees not to listen to religious discourses given by women. In the case of widows, Swaminarayan directed those who could not follow the path of chastity to remarry. For those who could, he lay down strict rules which included them being under the control of male members of the family. This may seem regressive, however, it gave them \\"a respected and secure place in the social order\\" of the time. Swaminarayan restricted widows \\"to live always under the control of male members of their family and prohibited them from receiving instruction in any science from any man excepting their nearest relations.\\"  Caste system and the poor  Swaminarayan distributing food among the needy After assuming the leadership of the sampradaya, Swaminarayan worked to assist the poor by distributing food and drinking water. He undertook several social service projects and opened almshouses for the poor. Swaminarayan organized food and water relief to people during times of drought. The faith largely had excluded the mass of the poor, such as marginal peasants, agricultural labourers, the informal sector working class, adivasis and dalits. Dalits were banned from Swaminarayan temples from the beginning though in one case a separate temple was created for their use. Some suggest that Swaminarayan worked towards ending the caste system, allowing everyone into the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. However partaking in the consumption food of lower castes and caste pollution was not supported by him. A political officer in Gujarat, Mr. Williamson reported to Bishop Herber that Swaminarayan had \\"destroyed the yoke of caste.\\" He instructed his paramhansas to collect alms from all sections of society and appointed people from the lower strata of society as his personal attendants. Members of the lower castes were attracted to the movement as it improved their social status. Swaminarayan would eat along with the lower Rajput and Khati castes but not any lower.Williams 2001, p. 170 He established separate places of worship for the lower caste population where they were in large numbers. However, Dalits - those outside of the caste system - were formally excluded from Swaminarayan temples.The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India Christopher John Fuller P. 173 Members of a lower caste are prohibited from wearing a full sect mark (tilak chandlo) on their forehead. Even now, however, for the vast majority of Gujarat's lower-caste, Untouchable and tribal population, the sect is out of bounds. Reginald Heber, the Lord Bishop of Calcutta, noted that disciples of Swaminarayan cut across all castes, and even included Muslims. He writes \\"they all pray to one God with no difference of castes. They live as if they were brothers.\\" Furthermore, in a meeting with Swaminarayan, he noted that \\"[Swaminarayan] did not regard the subject as of much importance, but that he wished not to give offense (to ancient Hindu system); that people might eat separately or together in this world, but that above \\"oopur\\" pointing to heaven, those distinctions would cease.\\" Swaminarayan worked thus to dispel the myth that moksha (salvation) was not attainable by everyone. He taught that the soul is neither male nor female, nor yoked to any specific caste.  Animal sacrifices and yajnas  Swaminarayan was against animal sacrifices as carried out by Brahmin priests during Vedic rituals, such as yajnas (fire sacrifices), influenced by the Kaula and Vama Marg cults. The priests consumed \\"sanctified\\" prasad in the form of meat of these animals. To solve this problem, Swaminarayan conducted several large-scale yajnas involving priests from Varanasi. These did not have animal sacrifices and were conducted in strict accordance with Vedic scriptures. Swaminarayan was successful in reinstating ahimsa through several such large-scale yajnas. Swaminarayan stressed lacto vegetarianism among his followers and forbade meat consumption, codifying the conduct in the Shikshapatri. Page 105  Establishing Law and Order of Gujarat  During the time when Swaminarayan came to Gujarat, the law and order situation of Gujarat was in worst ever. Neither British government nor local kings were able to control the robberies, killings, internal conflicts, rapes, and other uncultured events in Kathiyawar, Kutch and Gujarat. Upon reaching to Gujarat, Swaminarayan by His preaching and supernatural divine power restored noted notorious criminals as normal civilians. These criminals left their evil nature and started living life with high moral values to the extent that they would never rob, or kill any living being. Even they would not see the unknown women or would not drink alcohol and be strict vegetarian. Bombay Governor Sir Malcolm was impressed by social reforms of Swaminarayan and so had come down to Rajkot to meet Swaminarayan personally and to appreciate His work towards educating high moral values to the people of Gujarat and helping British Government in reducing criminal graph of Gujarat. Swaminarayan had vowed not to kill the evil people but to kill their evil nature. The Bishop of Calcutta also noted that Swaminarayan \\"preached a great degree of purity, forbidding his disciples so much as to (not) look on any woman whom they passed. He condemned theft and bloodshed; and those villages and districts which had received him, from being among worst, were now among the best and most orderly in the provinces.\\" Temples and ascetics Swaminarayan and Paramhansas in Gadhada Swaminarayan ordered the construction of several Hindu temples and he had built six huge temples by himself and installed the idols of various deities such as Nara-Narayana in two temples, Laxminarayan Dev, Gopinathji Maharaj, Radha Raman Dev and Madanmohan Lalji . The images in the temples built by Swaminarayan provide evidence of the priority of Krishna. Disciples of Swaminarayan composed devotional poems which are widely sung by the tradition during festivals. Swaminarayan introduced fasting and devotion among followers. He conducted the festivals of Vasant Panchami, Holi, and Janmashtami with organization of the traditional folk dance raas. The first temple Swaminarayan constructed was in Ahmedabad in 1822, with the land for construction given by the British Imperial Government. Following a request of devotees from Bhuj, Swaminarayan asked his follower Vaishnavananand to build a temple there. Construction commenced in 1822, and the temple was built within a year. A temple in Vadtal followed in 1824, a temple in Dholera in 1826, a temple in Junagadh in 1828 and a temple in Gadhada, also in 1828. By the time of his death, Swaminarayan had also ordered construction of temples in Muli, Dholka and Jetalpur. From early on, ascetics have played a major role in the Swaminarayan sect. They contribute towards growth and development of the movement, encouraging people to follow a pious and religious life. Tradition maintains that Swaminarayan initiated 500 ascetics as paramhansas in a single night. Paramhansa is a title of honour sometimes applied to Hindu spiritual teachers who are regarded as having attained enlightenment. Paramhansas were the highest order of sannyasi in the sect. Prominent paramhansas included Muktanand Swami, Gopalanand Swami, Brahmanand Swami, Gunatitanand Swami, Premanand Swami, Nishkulanand Swami, and Nityanand Swami. Scriptures Swaminarayan under a Neem tree in Gadhada Swaminarayan propagated general Hindu texts. He held the Bhagavata Purana in high authority. However, there are many texts that were written by Swaminarayan or his followers that are regarded as shastras or scriptures within the Swaminarayan sect. Notable scriptures throughout the sect include the Shikshapatri and the Vachanamrut. Other important works and scriptures include the Satsangi Jeevan, Swaminarayan's authorized biography, the Muktanand Kavya, the Nishkulanand Kavya and the Bhakta Chintamani. Shikshapatri Swaminarayan wrote the Shikshapatri on 11 February 1826. While the original Sanskrit manuscript is not available, it was translated into Gujarati by Nityanand Swami under the direction of Swaminarayan and is revered in the sect. The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency summarised it as a book of social laws that his followers should follow. A commentary on the practice and understanding of dharma, it is a small booklet containing 212 Sanskrit verses, outlining the basic tenets that Swaminarayan believed his followers should uphold in order to live a well-disciplined and moral life. The oldest copy of this text is preserved at the Bodleian Library of Oxford University and it is one of the very few presented by Sahajanand Swami himself. Acharya Tejendraprasad of Ahmedabad has indicated in a letter that he is not aware of any copy from the hand of Sahajanand older than this text. Swaminarayan in various places of Shikshapatri describes Shri Krishna as the greatest entity. In Shikshapatri shlok 1 and 108 are few places that mention that Swaminarayan prayed on Shri Krishna.

Vachanamrut The Vachanamrut (IAST: VacanƒÅm·πõta, lit. \\"immortalising ambrosia in the form of words\\") is a sacred Hindu text consisting of 273 religious discourses delivered by Swaminarayan from 1819 to 1829 CE and is considered the principal theological text within the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. Compiled by four of his senior disciples, Swaminarayan edited and approved the scripture. As followers believe Swaminarayan to be Parabrahman, or God, the Vachanamrut is considered a direct revelation from God and thus the most precise interpretation of the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and other important Hindu scriptures. In the Vachanamrut, Swaminarayan outlines the Akshar-Purushottam Darshan and the necessity of the Aksharbrahman guru to attain moksha, a spiritual state characterised by eternal bliss and devotion to God. This scripture is read by followers regularly and discourses are conducted daily in Swaminarayan temples around the world. Satsangi Jeevan Satsangi Jeevan is the authorised biography of Swaminarayan. The book contains information on the life and teachings of Swaminarayan. It is written by Shatanand Swami and completed in Vikram Samvat 1885. Swaminarayan decided to make Gadhada his permanent residence on the insistence of Dada Khachar and his sisters. Swaminarayan instructed Shatanand Swami to write a book on his life and pastimes. To enable Shatanand Swami to write from His childhood, Swaminarayan had blessed Shatanand Swami with Sanjay Drishti - special power to see the entire past right from His childhood. Once written by Shatanand Swami, this book was verified and authenticated by Swaminarayan. He was much pleased to read the book. Swaminarayan then asked his disciples to do Katha of Satsangi Jeevan.  Mahatma Gandhi on Swaminarayan  In relation to Swaminarayan's work and views, Gandhi remarked that \\"the work accomplished by Swaminarayan in Gujarat could not and would never have been achieved by the law.\\" However, in the letter to his nephew, he expressed that Swaminarayan's values didn't align perfectly with his interpretation of Vaishnavism and the love taught by Swaminarayana was all about sentimentalism. Commenting on Gandhi's social work, N.A. Toothi \\"most of his thought, activities and even methods of most of the institutions which he has been building up and serving, have the flavour of Swaminarayanism, more than that of any other sect of Hindu Dharma.\\" Relations with other religions and the British Government The first Swaminarayan Mandir was constructed on the land granted by the British Imperial Government in Ahmedabad. Swaminarayan strived to maintain good relationships with people of other religions, sometimes meeting prominent leaders. His followers cut across religious boundaries, including people of Muslim and Parsi backgrounds. Swaminarayan's personal attendants included Khoja Muslims. In Kathiawad, many Muslims wore kanthi necklaces given by Swaminarayan. He also had a meeting with Reginald Heber, Lord Bishop of Calcutta and a leader of Christians in India at the time. Bishop Heber mentions in his account of the meeting that about two hundred disciples of Swaminarayan accompanied him as his bodyguards mounted on horses and carrying Matchlocks and swords. Bishop Heber himself had about a hundred horse guards accompanying him (fifty horses and fifty muskets) and mentioned that it was humiliating for him to see two religious leaders meeting at the head of two small armies, his being the smaller contingent. As a result of the meeting, both leaders gained mutual respect for one another. Swaminarayan enjoyed a good relationship with the British Imperial Government. The first temple he built, in Ahmedabad, was built on of land given by the government. The British officers gave it a 101 gun salute when it was opened. It was in an 1825 meeting with Reginald Heber that Swaminarayan is said to have intimated that he was a manifestation of Krishna. In 1830, Swaminarayan had a meeting with Sir John Malcolm, Governor of Bombay (1827 to 1830). According to Malcolm, Swaminarayan had helped bring some stability to a lawless region. During the meeting with Malcolm, Swaminarayan gave him a copy of the Shikshapatri. This copy of the Shikshapatri is currently housed at the Bodleian Library at University of Oxford. Death and succession Madan Mohan and Radha (centre and right) with Swaminarayan in the form of Hari Krishna (left), installed by Swaminarayan on the central altar in Dholera (1826) In 1830, Swaminarayan gathered his followers and announced his departure. He later died on 1 June 1830 (Jeth sud 10, Samvat 1886), and it is believed by followers that, at the time of his death, Swaminarayan left Earth for Akshardham, his abode. He was cremated according to Hindu rites at Lakshmi Wadi in Gadhada. Prior to his death, Swaminarayan decided to establish a line of acharyas or preceptors, as his successors. He established two gadis (seats of leadership). One seat was established at Ahmedabad (Nar Narayan Dev Gadi) and the other one at Vadtal (Laxmi Narayan Dev Gadi) on 21 November 1825. Swaminarayan appointed an acharya to each of these gadis to pass on his message to others and to preserve his fellowship, the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. These acharyas came from his immediate family after sending representatives to search them out in Uttar Pradesh. He formally adopted a son from his brothers and appointed him to the office of acharya. Ayodhyaprasad, the son of Swaminarayan's elder brother Rampratap and Raghuvira, the son of his younger brother Ichcharam, were appointed acharyas of the Ahmedabad Gadi and the Vadtal Gadi respectively. Swaminarayan decreed that the office should be hereditary so that acharyas would maintain a direct line of blood descent from his family. The administrative division of his followers into two territorial dioceses is set forth in minute detail in a document written by Swaminarayan called Desh Vibhaag Lekh. Swaminarayan stated to all the devotees and saints to obey both the Acharyas and Gopalanand Swami who was considered as the main pillar and chief ascetic for the sampradaya. The current acharya of the Ahmedabad Gadi is Koshalendraprasad Pande and Ajendraprasad Pande, of the Vadtal Gadi. Decades after his death, several divisions occurred with different understandings of succession. This included the establishment of Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS), the founder of which left the Vadtal Gadi in 1905, and Maninagar Swaminarayan Gadi Sansthan, the founder of which left the Ahmedabad Gadi in the 1940s. The followers of BAPS hold Gunatitanand Swami as the spiritual successor to Swaminarayan, asserting that on several occasions Swaminarayan revealed to devotees that Gunatitanand Swami was Aksharbrahm manifest. Followers of BAPS believe that the acharyas were given administrative leadership of the sect while Gunatitanand Swami was given spiritual leadership by Swaminarayan. The current spiritual and administrative leader of BAPS is Mahant Swami Maharaj. The followers of the Maninagar Swaminarayan Gadi Sansthan hold Gopalanand Swami as the successor to Swaminarayan. The current leader of this sect is Purushottampriyadasji Maharaj. Following and manifestation belief Nara Narayana installed by Swaminarayan in the first Swaminarayan Temple, Ahmedabad. According to the biographer Raymond Williams, when Swaminarayan died, he had a following of 1.8 million people. In 2001, Swaminarayan centres existed on four continents, and the congregation was recorded to be five million, the majority in the homeland of Gujarat.Marcus J. Banks (1985). Review: A New Face of Hinduism: The Swaminarayan Religion. By Raymond Brady Williams. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 1984. Pp. xiv, 217. Modern Asian Studies 19 pp 872-874 The newspaper Indian Express estimated members of the Swaminarayan sect of Hinduism to number over 20 million (2 crore) worldwide in 2007. In his discourses recorded in the Vachanamrut, Swaminarayan mentions that humans would not be able to withstand meeting god in his divine form, hence God takes human form (simultaneously living in his abode) so people can approach, understand and love him in the form of an Avatar. While no detailed statistical information is available, most of the followers of Swaminarayan share a belief that Swaminarayan is the complete manifestation of Narayana or Purushottam Narayana - the Supreme Being and superior to other avatars. A Swaminarayan sectarian legend tells how Narayana from the Nara Narayana pair, was cursed by sage Durvasa to incarnate on the earth as Swaminarayan. Some of Swaminarayan's followers believe he was an incarnation of Lord Krishna. The images and stories of Swaminarayan and Krishna have coincided in the liturgy of the sect. The story of the birth of Swaminarayan parallels that of Krishna's birth from the scripture Bhagavata Purana. Swaminarayan himself is said to have intimated that he was a manifestation of God in a meeting with Reginald Heber, the Lord Bishop of Calcutta, in 1825. The belief of many followers that their founder was the incarnation of the Supreme God has also drawn criticism. According to Professor Raymond B. Williams, Swaminarayan was criticized because he received large gifts from his followers and dressed and traveled as a Maharaja even though he had taken the vows of renunciation of the world. Swaminarayan responded that he accepts gifts for the emancipation of his followers. Vedic scriptures support Lord Swaminarayan's existence as the incarnation of the Supreme being. One such scripture of Hinduism is the Skanda Puran (attributed to Rishi Veda Vyasa), which foretells of an incarnation named Narayan Muni (one of the names given to Swaminarayan by his guru Ramanand Swami) to take place in the age of Kali after the Buddha incarnation and before the incarnation of Kalki. The Skanda Puran's Vaishnav Khand's Vasudev Mahatmyam adhyay 18 shlok 42 onwards details this incarnation. It foretells that this incarnation will advent upon the region of Koshal Desh, due to a curse of a muni (Rishi Dursvasa). It mentions this incarnation will establish dharma and be born to Dharma and Bhakti as a Saamvedi Brahmin bestowed with the name Narayan Muni.http://vedicreserve.mum.edu/puranas/skanda_purana/skanda_purana_02vaishnava_09vasudeva.pdf  See also  * Akshar-Purushottam Darshan NotesReferences Sources   *Reginald Heber Lord Bishop of Calcutta - Narrative of a Journey Through the Upper Provinces of India, from Calcutta To Bombay, Volume 2 External links ;Swaminarayan Sampraday *The Ahmedabad Gadi of the Swaminarayan Sampraday *The Vadtal Gadi of the Swaminarayan Sampraday *BAPS *Shree Swaminarayan Gurukul Rajkot ;Other  * * Category:1781 births Category:1830 deaths Category:17th-century Hindu religious leaders Category:18th-century Hindu religious leaders Category:Founders of new religious movements Category:Indian Hindu religious leaders Category:Indian Vaishnavites Category:Regional Hindu gods Category:Swaminarayan sect of Hinduism Category:Vishishtadvaita Vedanta Category:Vaishnava saints Category:Vaishnavism Category:Scholars from Uttar Pradesh ","title":"Swaminarayan"},{"id":"3813017","text":"Farmer City is a ghost town in Wichita County, Kansas, United States.

It was notable for the use of its unique \\"living board game\\" concept and for premiering soon after the quiz show scandals. Personnel Jack Narz served as the host (introduced on-air as \\"the Mayor\\") from the show's premiere until September 9, 1960, after which he departed for personal reasons. Red Rowe filled in as Mayor for the week of September 16 (including the final nighttime episode); the following Monday, Monty Hall replaced Narz and hosted through the remainder of the show's run. Kenny Williams served as the announcer (the \\"town crier\\") throughout the show's run. Joanne Copeland (later to become the second Mrs. Johnny Carson) served as the show's original hostess during the time it originated from New York City. Shortly after Hall joined the show and Heatter-Quigley moved Village to CBS Television City in Hollywood, California, Copeland was replaced by Eileen Barton. Rules Two contestants played the role of tokens on a human-size game board with three streets: Money Street, Bridge Street and Magic Mile. Players advanced according to the roll of a large six-sided die in a chuck-a-luck, rolled on the sidelines by a partner (almost always a spouse or boyfriend/girlfriend) and called out by announcer Williams. After Video Village moved to California, the die was replaced by an electric randomizer. Any time a player landed on the space their opponent was on, they could either take an extra turn or force their opponent to return to the beginning of that street. The squares changed throughout the show's run, but some of the more notable ones included: *Money squares: Located on Money Street, contestants received between $5‚Äì$20 depending on the space. *Bus Stop, Do It Yourself and Take A Chance: Players landing on any one of these spaces must draw a card and follow the instructions written on the card. *Jail: Located between Money Street and Bridge Street, contestants could be sent here either by landing on a \\"Go to Jail\\" space or drawing a card which instructed them to do so. To get out, the contestant had to successfully predict whether their roll would be either even or odd. *Ask the Council: Located on Money Street and Magic Mile, the contestant was asked a humorous, open-ended question. He/she won cash if the audience ‚Äî acting as the \\"council\\" ‚Äî was judged to agree. *Finders Keepers: The first player to land on this space received a prize. *Shops: Located on the Magic Mile, these were five themed \\"stores\\" (Bank, Appliance Store, Jewelry Store, etc.) which each contained a prize. The first contestant to land on the store's space won that prize. *Safety Zone: Any player landing here is safe from any penalty imposed by their opponent. *1-2-3 Go: Any player landing on this space remained on it until getting a 1, 2, or 3. *Exchange Places: The very last square on the board before the two \\"Finish\\" lines, the unlucky contestant who landed here must change places with their opponent‚Äîno matter how far back he or she was. The first contestant to reach either of the two \\"Finish\\" spaces (they had to do so by an exact roll) won the game and the right to return to play in the next game. Both contestants kept the cash and prizes they accumulated. Spin- offs A spin-off, Video Village Junior (sometimes also called Kideo Village) aired on Saturday mornings from September 30, 1961 to June 16, 1962; It was essentially the same game, except with children participating as the contestants (and a parent serving as their \\"significant other\\"). Its last episode aired the day after Video Village concluded its run. Two years following Village's cancellation, a new Saturday morning kids' show, Shenanigans, premiered with game play similar to that of Village. It aired on ABC in 1964 and 1965, and was also a Heatter-Quigley production. The host was Stubby Kaye and the announcer was Kenny Williams (appearing as Kenny the Cop), who had also been the announcer on Village. Like Village, a board game based on the show was manufactured by Milton-Bradley. Episode status The series is believed to have been destroyed as per network practices of the era. Four episodes are known to survive ‚Äì the second nighttime episode, an episode guest-hosted by Rowe (also the final nighttime show), the 500th daytime episode, and the third-to-last episode of Video Village Junior. Foreign versions An Australian version, based on Video Village Junior, was in production from 1962 to 1966, made by Crawford Productions for HSV-7. Hosted by Danny Webb with Elizabeth Harris and Chris Christensen (later replaced by Vic Gordon). Each episode of the show ended with children singing a song. A similar concept was later used in the Canadian game show The Mad Dash, which aired on CTV from 1978 to 1985. Also similar have been Italian and Spanish language game shows named for and in imitation of the Game of the Goose. Board game In 1960, Milton Bradley released a board game \\"home version\\" of the game. Its rules closely matched those of the television program. The game proved popular enough that Milton Bradley continued to sell copies even after the show had been cancelled. Milton Bradley's Boob Tube game was also sold as a Video Village tie-in. Music Music for the show was provided by a live combo led by musical director Sid Wayne, consisting of organ, drums, xylophone and bass. Additionally, when Monty Hall became host, the \\"Village Bus\\", a golf cart-like vehicle, was added to shuttle contestants from the finish line back to start at the conclusion of the game. While driving it, he and hostess Eileen Barton would sing \\"The Village Bus Song\\", added to showcase both hosts' musical abilities.

It concentrates mainly on anchoring systems, fire protection systems, installation systems, measuring and detection tools (such as laser levels, range meters and line lasers), power tools (such as hammer drills, demolition hammers, diamond drills, cordless electric drills, heavy angle drills, power saws) and related software and services. Hilti, a registered trademark of the various Hilti corporate entities, is the family name of the company's founders. History= 1941‚Äì1946  In 1941, the Hilti company was founded by Martin and Eugen Hilti,Hilti: Company Milestones. with the opening of a mechanical workshop in Schaan, Liechtenstein. Martin Hilti was trained in mechanical engineering and automotive design at the Wismar Engineering College and was 26 at the time of founding the company.

To make ends meet Martin Hilti signed sub- contracts as diverse as gray cast iron parts for the Swiss textile industry, machining eggcups molds, or lighters and pencil sharpeners.Peter Geiger et al.: Frage zu Liechtenstein in der NS-Zeit und im Zweiten Weltkrieg: Fl√ºchtlinge, Verm√∂genswerte, Kunst R√ºstungsproduktion. Vaduz, Z√ºrich 2005. In the late 1940s Martin Hilti found a technology that would allow setting nails into concrete or masonry, and he acquired the original designs and the patents rights of what would later become Hilti's Direct Fastening first tool. Although promising, the technology proved to be immature, and required significant development. In the meantime, through the early 1950s, Hilti produced its own line of household products, which included a cigarette lighter, and a water-powered kitchen mixer called \\"Ello\\", which enjoyed considerable success. In 1952, with a solution that proved mature to be marketed, Hilti launched its first construction-related product, a manual tool to drive threaded studs into steel. In 1953 the company introduced its first powder-actuated high-velocity fastener that allowed setting nails into concrete, called Perfix. At this time Hilti opened offices in Italy, Belgium, Poland, Finland, Norway, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal, Austria, France, Australia, Canada and the USA. In 1963 Hilti was present in 23 countries, with a turnover of over 400 million Swiss francs.  1964‚Äì1979 In 1964 Hilti started marketing a drill that also had a chiselling function, made by the Kocher Company, in Basel, under the name \\"Torna 765\\". After receiving customer feedback Hilti started a product development and improvement project under the name \\"Torna Entwicklung\\" (German for \\"Torna Development\\"), or \\"TE\\" for short, which has since then become the standard name for all Hilti electropneumatic tools. In 1967 the company introduced the TE17, a fully electropneumatic rotary hammer drill which featured a safety clutch, and it was shipped to customers in Hilti's first distinctive red toolbox. The global expansion continued throughout the 1960s and by 1971, Hilti's global turnover was 376 million Swiss francs across 45 countries, including new production facilities in Austria and in Germany. In 1974 Hilti started to develop and market anchor bolts, and in 1977 Hilti introduced its first chemical anchor product line. Two more production facilities were opened, a plastic manufacturing plant in Germany purchased in 1975 and a plant in England acquired in 1978. In 1979 the company opened another production facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA, to produce anchors. During the 1980s Hilti formed market region centers for America, Europe, Africa and Asia, to improve the proximity to their customers. 1979‚Äìpresent In 1995 Hilti opened its first Chinese manufacturing plant in Zhanjiang this was plant was expanded to 55,000 square meters in 2005. Another manufacturing plant was opened in Shanghai in 2004.

Election expenses Sections 72 to 90 control the total election expenses that can be spent on behalf of a candidate. During the time limit of the election, all money spent on the promotion of a candidate must be authorised by his election agent.

In a statement released through his lawyer, Woolas stated that \\"this election petition raised fundamental issues about the freedom to question and criticise politicians\\" and that it \\"will inevitably chill political speech\\". The judicial review failed to overturn the ruling of the election court. In June 2015 the independent candidate in Mid Bedfordshire, Tim Ireland, lodged an appeal against the result at the general election, accusing Nadine Dorries of breaches of section 106 by making false statements about his character. The petition was rejected by the High Court of Justice because it was served at Dorries' constituency office and not her home address. Corrupt withdrawal from candidature Section 107 makes it illegal to bribe a candidate to withdraw from an election. Premises not to be used as committee rooms Section 108 made it illegal to hire a room in a pub for holding a campaign committee meeting. This section was repealed by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Payments for exhibition of election notices Section 109 prohibits hiring special advertising spaces (e.g. on the sides of houses) for the display of campaign posters (hiring ordinary advertising billboards used for regular advertising is permitted). Details to appear on election publications Section 110 states that any material, leaflet or advertisement for a candidate in an election must include the names and addresses of the printer, the promoter, and the person on behalf of whom the material is being published. In December 2008 a Liverpool City Liberal Democrats councillor was found guilty under this section for delivering leaflets during the 2007 United Kingdom local elections purporting to be on behalf of The United Socialist Party (but lacking the necessary names and addresses) attacking the Labour candidate for crossing a picket line during a strike, and accusing his wife (who is a sitting councillor) of leaving council meetings early to learn lap dancing.

After the Japanese captured the Dutch East Indies in 1942, most of the world's supply of natural rubber was out of Allied hands. Due to the importance of rubber products for both modern life and modern warfare, the loss of such an important resource at this phase in the war was a crisis. A factory was established in Sarnia, Ontario, using German patents from an American licensee. Polymer produced approximately 3,300 tons of synthetic rubber from oil every month from when production first began at the end of 1943 to the wars end in 1945. Sarnia was chosen because it is the point of intake the most secure and reliable source of crude oil coming into Canada; a type suitable for the synthetic rubber making process. The site was also chosen due to the adjacent St. Clair River which provides the necessary water supply for the production of synthetic rubber. The product was used in everything from tires to airplane parts and much of it was sold to the US as part of the common war effort. With the combination of synthetic rubber produced by Polymer, reclaimed rubber, and rubber product rationing, Canada was able to meet its war-time needs. The company was considered a roaring success, more efficient than its American counterparts and a national asset. Clarence Decatur Howe, under whose Department of Munitions and Supply the company fell, decided to keep Polymer going as a Crown corporation after the war. Even as early as 1942, Howe said, \\"I don't think we will ever go back to crude rubber.\\" It was a highly profitable enterprise, and he was not convinced that any buyer would pay a proper price or keep it going. Polymer therefore survived the war, reporting through Howe and his successors to Parliament until 1971 when it was sold to the Canada Development Corporation which was a government controlled enterprise. The company was also involved in the petrochemicals industry, primarily in the production of polyurethane. It was renamed Polysar in 1976 and the rubber component became a subsidiary, Polysar Rubber Corp. Sadly, the company became infamous for its pollution spills, including 48 spills reported in the Sarnia area between 1972 and 1984 alone. After a 1985 report showing that Polysar had more spills than any of its neighbours, further spills occurred: 7,000 gallons of oil on 25 July 1986 and 28,000 gallons of partially treated wastewater on 19 August 1986, and many more in subsequent years. By 1989, Polysar Ltd was listed among the \\"dirty dozen\\" polluters in Ontario: The company was privatized in 1988 with its sale to NOVA Corp which, in turn, sold Polysar Rubber in 1990 to Bayer AG of Germany. The original Sarnia production facilities were shut down through a series of closures from 1995 through 2002, but the site remains active, operating facilities built through expansion beginning in the 1980s. In 2005 Bayer AG spun off chemical divisions, including most of the Sarnia site, creating LANXESS AG, also of Germany. Polymer's contribution was recognized by the 1971 Canadian ten-dollar note of the Scenes of Canada series, which depicted a scene of its operations on the reverse.Bellamy, Matthew J., Profiting The Crown: Canada's Polymer Corporation, 1942-1990, McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, (2005) , page ii The image was used because the company had \\"achieved a world-wide reputation\\" and the image \\"provided detail ideally suited to engraving\\". It has been cited as an example of how crown corporations can be profitable over a sustained period of time and contribute to the economy.Bellamy, Matthew J., Profiting The Crown: Canada's Polymer Corporation, 1942-1990, McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, (2005) ReferencesExternal links *Profiting the Crown: Canada's Polymer Corporation, 1942-1990 by Matthew Bellamy (book excerpts) Category:Chemical companies of Canada Category:Chemical companies established in 1942 Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of Canada Category:Former Crown corporations of Canada Category:1942 establishments in Ontario Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 1988 Category:1988 disestablishments in Ontario ","title":"Polymer Corporation"},{"id":"3813164","text":"Alvin James Baldus (April 27, 1926 ‚Äì February 2, 2017) was an American Democratic politician and former member of Congress for Wisconsin.

Purchased by the Union Navy on 1 September 1862, she was converted to a gunboat and commissioned on 27 November 1862, Acting Master W. G. Saltonstall in command. Commodore Hull was named in honor of Commodore Isaac Hull (1773‚Äì1843), a significant U.S. Naval commander during and after the War of 1812. There were four subsequent s, all destroyers. Civil War Service=Assigned to the North Atlantic blockade Commodore Hulls ferryboat design made her especially useful for operations in sheltered waters, so she was assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and operated along the coasts and rivers of Virginia and North Carolina. She took part in the siege of Washington, N.C. from 30 March‚Äì16 April 1863. In Albemarle Sound, she took part in the 5 May 1864 Battle of Albemarle Sound with the Confederate ironclad CSS Albemarle. As a picket, Commodore Hull was the first to sight the formidable ram approaching and fired at her from close quarters in the three-hour engagement. Siege of Plymouth Commodore Hull joined in the attacks on and the capture of Plymouth, N.C. on 29 October. On 31 October, she was heavily damaged by Confederate batteries, losing four killed and three wounded. Coxswain Patrick Colbert was awarded the Medal of Honor for action on that date. Colbert's Medal of Honor citation reads: > Served on board the U.S.S. Commodore Hull at the capture of Plymouth, 31 > October 1864. Painfully wounded by a shell which killed the man at his side, > Colbert, as captain of the forward pivot gun, remained at his post until the > end of the action, braving the heavy enemy fire and appearing as cool as if > at mere target practice. End of service Commodore Hull was repaired and remained active until the end of the Civil War. She was decommissioned on 8 June 1865 at the New York Navy Yard. Commodore Hull was sold at the Yard on 27 September. She was subsequently renamed to Waccamaw in civilian employment, which lasted until sometime prior to 1885. Abandoned on the Cape Fear River across from downtown Wilmington, North Carolina, the steamboat was burned to the waterline in 1886. Some of her remains are still visible at low tide.

He has been a Jatiya Sangsad member from Nilphamari-2 constituency since 2001 and served as the Cultural Affairs Minister during 2014‚Äì2019. Noor worked as an actor in theatre, film and television productions. He is best known for his role as Baker Bhai in the television series Kothao Keu Nei. His other notable television works include Ayomoy, Bohubrihi and Ei Shob Din Ratri. His notable films are Shonkhonil Karagar (1992) and Aguner Poroshmoni (1994). In 2018, Noor was awarded the Independence Day Award, the highest civilian state award in Bangladesh, by the Government of Bangladesh. Early life Noor was born in Jalpaiguri in West Bengal (now in India) in 1946 to Abu Nazem Mohammad Ali and Amina. His family migrated to Nilphamari District in East Bengal (now in Bangladesh) in 1948. Both of his parents worked as school teachers. He studied in Nilphamari College, Carmichael College and the University of Dhaka. Career=Actor Noor's acting career began with the theatre. In 1973, he joined the theatre group \\"Nagorik\\". He was a receptionist of the paper \\"Chitraly\\" at that time and went to take the interview of the prominent actors that time. There he met Aly Zaker, an actor of Nagorik, who asked him to visit the rehearsal of his new team. Later he joined that group. At first, he used to work behind the stage as a prompter. At one point the rehearsal of the drama \\"Toilo Shonkot\\" which was written by Rashid Haider was going on, when with only two days remaining until performance day, the leading actor of that drama Abul Hayat got injured. As Noor had learned all the lines in his role as a prompter, Zaker asked Noor to take the part. Following a bit of persuasion from the other cast Noor performed the role and thus began his career as an actor. Noor's first television drama \\"Rang-er Phanush\\" was directed by Abdullah al Mamun in 1974.\\"Onek Din Por\\", Prothom Alo. 8 September 2005. Noor got his break-through in acting during his early days as a Bangladesh Television dramatic artist and has since starred in many television shows and films. In 2018, Noor returned to the stage with his long-term acting partner, Zaker, in a Bengali adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play The Life of Galileo about the 17th Century polymath Galileo Galilei. The role of Galileo was played by Zaker with Noor playing a number of supporting roles. The play ran for a limited number of performances in Dhaka's Bailey Road. Politics Noor came to politics during the period of Ayub Khan in 1962. He was a student and had joined the East Pakistan Students' Union, which was a left-sided organisation. Later he became the chairman of the Nilfamari Mohokuma Shomeetee. In 1966, he was admitted to Dhaka University to study law still a member of the Students' Union. Later he became the cultural secretary of the central committee. He also was the chairman of the Shongskriti Shongshod, a very large cultural organisation of Dhaka University. Noor stayed in the Iqbal Hall (now Johurul Huq hall) which was the centre of student politics during that period. At that time Noor came in contact with the versatile student leaders of that time. Though the followers of different political belief they worked together against the dictatorship of West Pakistan government. At the eve of Bangladesh Liberation War, Noor left Dhaka and came back to Nilphamari District when he received an order from his political party on 8 March 1971. There he helped the then East Pakistan Rifles (now Border Guards Bangladesh). He crossed the border during the War of Liberation on 8 April. Noor was a freedom fighter under the Sector-6 and helped to organise the war and took training. He also helped to recruit freedom fighters during the nine-month war period. But following the liberation of Bangladesh he grew more distant with active politics. However, later Noor became active in the 1990 Mass Uprising against the military leader Ershad. In 1996, Noor was asked by the Bangladesh Awami League leader and future Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, to run as an Awami League candidate in the upcoming parliamentary election. However, claiming he was not yet ready, he postponed participation until the subsequent general election in 2001, running in his home-town, Nilphamari. In the 2001 general election Noor was elected as the Member of Parliament for Nilphamari-2, a constituency in the north-west, where he won with 38% of the popular vote. In the subsequent 2008 general election Noor was re-elected, increasing his vote share to 62%. In 2013, his election convoy in Nilphamari was attacked by activists of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, causing the deaths of five people. Noor ran unopposed in the 2014 general election, as the election was boycotted by the opposition alliance. He was elected for a fourth consecutive time in the 2018 general election for Nilphamari-2. In 2014, Noor was appointed to the Cabinet by the Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, as Minister for the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. He served a full term as Minister but was dropped from the subsequent Cabinet formed in 2019.  Other Activities  Noor is an elocutionist known for his poetry and prose recitation and his oration. He has lent his voice to numerous television shows as a narrator and to advertisements. Noor is the former Vice Chairman at Asiatic Three Sixty and the former Managing Director at Desh Television, but resigned from these posts when assuming his role a Minister.

They had much in common with the Milwaukee Road's class F7 and the Chicago and North Western Railway's class E-4, all three types being fast, 84-inch drivered 4-6-4s for Midwestern service with 300 lb/in¬≤ boiler pressures. In December 1937, locomotive #3461 set a world record for the longest single run by a steam locomotive by completing the from Los Angeles, California to Chicago without maintenance other than five refuelling stops en route, hauling Train #8, the Fast Mail Express. An average speed of was obtained, including stops; maximum speed during the run was . During steeply graded portions of the run it was, of course, assisted by helper locomotives. Such long distance runs were a goal of railway operating departments, enabling a reduction in locomotive numbers and through increased locomotive utilization, reduce overall costs. The first locomotive, #3460, was built streamlined; painted light, robin's egg blue and silver, it became known as the \\"Blue Goose\\". It was the Santa Fe's only streamlined steam locomotive, featuring extensively in railroad publicity and was a railfan favorite. Locomotive #3461 was fitted with a streamlined \\"skyline\\" casing along the top of the boiler, encasing stack and domes, in an experiment to see if it helped clear smoke away from the locomotive. It was not retained. All of the locomotives otherwise had a Santa Fe-style telescoping stack extension fitted, which elongated the stack to clear smoke better and could be lowered to pass under low bridges and tunnels. The 3460 class 4-6-4s, the 3765 class 4-8-4s, and the 5001 class 2-10-4s were designed and ordered around the same time and had much in common in their designs; in addition, they used the same six-axle tender design. The classes together were often called the \\"Big Three\\". Only one of this class survives, #3463, on static display on the grounds to the Southeast of the Kansas Expocentre in Topeka, Kansas.

Rajeev Motwani contributed to the 2000, and later, edition.  Nickname  The Jargon File records the book's nickname thusly: \\"So called because the cover depicts a girl (putatively Cinderella) sitting in front of a Rube Goldberg device and holding a rope coming out of it. On the back cover, the device is in shambles after she has (inevitably) pulled on the rope.\\"  Edition history and reception  The forerunner of this book appeared under the title Formal Languages and Their Relation to Automata in 1968. Forming a basis both for the creation of courses on the topic, as well as for further research, that book shaped the field of automata theory for over a decade, cf. (Hopcroft 1989).  * * Formal Languages and Their Relation to Automata appeared in 1968, with an inornate cover. The first edition of Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation was published in 1979, the second edition in November 2000, and the third edition appeared in February 2006. Since the second edition, Rajeev Motwani has joined Hopcroft and Ullman as the third author. Starting with the second edition, the book features extended coverage of examples where automata theory is applied, whereas large parts of more advanced theory were taken out. While this makes the second and third editions more accessible to beginners, it makes it less suited for more advanced courses. The new bias away from theory is not seen positive by all: As Shallit quotes one professor, \\"they have removed all good parts.\\" (Shallit 2008). The first edition in turn constituted a major revision of a previous textbook also written by Hopcroft and Ullman, entitled Formal Languages and Their Relation to Automata. It was published in 1968 and is referred to in the introduction of the 1979 edition. In a personal historical note regarding the 1968 book, Hopcroft states: \\"Perhaps the success of the book came from our efforts to present the essence of each proof before actually giving the proof\\" (Hopcroft 1989). Compared with the forerunner book, the 1979 edition was expanded, and the material was reworked to make it more accessible to students, cf. (Hopcroft 1989). This gearing towards understandability at the price of succinctness was not seen positive by all. As Hopcroft reports on feedback to the overhauled 1979 edition: \\"It seems that our attempts to lower the level of our presentation for the benefit of students by including more detail and explanations had an adverse effect on the faculty, who then had to sift through the added material to outline and prepare their lectures\\" (Hopcroft 1989). Still, the most cited edition of the book is apparently the 1979 edition: According to the website CiteSeerX, over 3000 scientific papers freely available online cite this edition of the book (CiteSeerX, 2009).

History  The Civic Federation was founded in 1893 as a reform organization by several of Chicago's most prominent citizens, including Jane Addams, Bertha Honore Palmer and Lyman J. Gage. The group united around the need to address concerns about Chicago's economic, political and moral climate at the end of the 19th century. The group's formation was catalyzed by a book by a visiting journalist, William T. Stead. Lyman J. Gage, president of the First National Bank, and the prominent socialite Bertha Honore Palmer were elected President and First Vice President of the Federation. The Director of Hull House, Jane Addams, served as a trustee. Chicago-area merchants, educators, bankers, ministers and labor officials joined them as charter members. In its early years, the Civic Federation advocated for social and political reform. It led efforts to improve sanitation and education, as well as improve Chicago-area government efficiency. Steel magnate Clayton Mark, who built Marktown, the planned worker community in Northwest Indiana, served several terms as President of the Civic Federation.Smith, S. & Mark, S. (2011).

Amate ( from ) is a type of bark paper that has been manufactured in Mexico since the precontact times. It was used primarily to create codices. Amate paper was extensively produced and used for both communication, records, and ritual during the Triple Alliance; however, after the Spanish conquest, its production was mostly banned and replaced by European paper. Amate paper production never completely died, nor did the rituals associated with it. It remained strongest in the rugged, remote mountainous areas of northern Puebla and northern Veracruz states. Spiritual leaders in the small village of San Pablito, Puebla were described as producing paper with \\"magical\\" properties. Foreign academics began studying this ritual use of amate in the mid-20th century, and the Otomi people of the area began producing the paper commercially. Otomi craftspeople began selling it in cities such as Mexico City, where the paper was revived by Nahua painters in Guerrero to create \\"new\\" indigenous craft, which was then promoted by the Mexican government. Through this and other innovations, amate paper is one of the most widely available Mexican indigenous handicrafts, sold both nationally and abroad. Nahua paintings of the paper, which is also called \\"amate,\\" receive the most attention, but Otomi paper makers have also received attention not only for the paper itself but for crafts made with it such as elaborate cut-outs. History Amate paper has a long history. This history is not only because the raw materials for its manufacture have persisted but also that the manufacture, distribution and uses have adapted to the needs and restrictions of various epochs. This history can be roughly divided into three periods: the pre-Hispanic period, the Spanish colonial period to the 20th century, and from the latter 20th century to the present, marked by the paper's use as a commodity.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 8, 80 Pre-Hispanic period Lacandon ceremonial bark paper tunic at the Casa Na Bolom museum in San Crist√≥bal de las Casas. Amate tree growing in northern Guerrero, Mexico. The development of paper in Mesoamerica parallels that of China and Egypt, which used rice and papyrus respectively. It is not known exactly where or when papermaking began in Mesoamerica.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 2-7 The oldest known amate paper dates back to 75 CE. It was discovered at the site of Huitzilapa, Jalisco. Huitzilapa is a shaft tomb culture site located northwest of Tequila Volcano near the town of Magdalena. The crumpled piece of paper was found in the southern chamber of the site's shaft tomb, possibly associated with a male scribe. Rather than being produced from Trema micrantha, from which modern amate is made, the amate found at Huitzilapa is made from Ficus tecolutensis.Benz et al. 2006 Iconography (in stone) dating from the period contains depictions of items thought to be paper. For example, Monument 52 from the Olmec site of San Lorenzo Tenochtitl√°n illustrates an individual adorned with ear pennants of folded paper.Miller and Taube (1993, p. 131) The oldest known surviving book made from amate paper may be the Grolier Codex, which Michael D. Coe and other researchers have asserted is authentic and dated to the 12th-13th century CE.Annalee Newitz (12 September 2016). \\"Confirmed: Mysterious ancient Maya book, Grolier Codex, is genuine: 900 year- old astronomy guide is oldest known book written in the Americas.\\" Ars Technica. Accessed 12 September 2016. Arguments from the 1940s to the 1970s have centered on a time of 300 CE of the use of bark clothing by the Maya people. Ethnolinguistic studies lead to the names of two villages in Maya territory that relate the use of bark paper, Excachach√© (\\"place where white bark trusses are smoothed\\") and Yokzachu√∫n (\\"over the white paper\\"). Anthropologist Marion mentions that in Lacandones, in Chiapas, the Maya were still manufacturing and using bark clothing in the 1980s. For these reason, it was probably the Maya who first propagated knowledge about bark-paper-making and spread it throughout southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador, when it was at its height in the pre-classic period.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 81 However, according researcher Hans Lenz, this Maya paper was likely not the amate paper known in later Mesoamerica.

Amate paper was used most extensively during the Triple Alliance Empire.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, p. 80 This paper was manufactured in over 40 villages in territory controlled by the Aztecs and then handed over as tribute by the conquered peoples. This amounted to about 480,000 sheets annually. Most of the production was concentrated in the modern state of Morelos, where Ficus trees are abundant because of the climate.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 90 This paper was assigned to the royal sector, to be used as gifts on special occasions or as rewards for warriors. It was also sent to the religious elites for ritual purposes. The last share was allotted to royal scribes for the writing of codices and other records.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 89 Little is known about the paper's manufacture in the pre- Hispanic period. Stone beaters dating from the 6th century CE have been found, and these tools are most often found where amate trees grow. Most are made of volcanic stone with some made of marble and granite. They are usually rectangular or circular with grooves on one or both sides to macerate the fibers. These beaters are still used by Otomi artisans, and almost all are volcanic, with an additional groove added on the side to help hold the stone. According to some early Spanish accounts, the bark was left overnight in water to soak, after which the finer inner fibers were separated from coarser outer fibers and pounded into flat sheets. But it is not known who did the work, or how the labor was divided.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 121‚Äì122 As a tribute item, amate was assigned to the royal sector because it was not considered to be a commodity. This paper was related to power and religion, the way through which the Aztecs imposed and justified their dominance in Mesoamerica. As tribute, it represented a transaction between the dominant groups and the dominated villages. In the second phase, the paper used by the royal authorities and priests for sacred and political purposes was a way to empower and frequently register all the other sumptuary exclusive things.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 115 Amate paper was created as part of a line of technologies to satisfy the human need to express and communicate. It was preceded by stone, clay and leather to transmit knowledge first in the form of pictures, and later with the Olmecs and Maya through a form of hieroglyphic writing. Bark paper had important advantages as it is easier to obtain than animal skins and was easier to work than other fibers. It could be bent, shirred, glued and melded for specific finishing touches and for decoration. Two more advantages stimulated the extensive use of bark paper: its light weight and its ease of transport, which translated into great savings in time, space and labor when compared with other raw materials.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 83 In the Aztec era, paper retained its importance as a writing surface, especially in the production of chronicles and the keeping of records such as inventories and accounting. Codices were converted into \\"books\\" by folding into an accordion pattern. Of the approximately 500 surviving codices, about 16 date to before the conquest and 4 are made of bark paper. These include the Dresden Codex from the Yucat√°n, the Fej√©rv√°ry-Mayer Codex from the Mixteca region and the Borgia Codex from Oaxaca.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 84 However, paper also had a sacred aspect and was used in rituals along with other items such as incense, copal, maguey thorns and rubber. For ceremonial and religious events, bark paper was used in various ways: as decorations used in fertility rituals, yiataztli, a kind of bag, and as an amatet√©uitl, a badge used to symbolize a prisoner's soul after sacrifice. It was also used to dress idols, priests and sacrifice victims in forms of crowns, stoles, plumes, wigs, trusses and bracelets. Paper items such as flags, skeletons and very long papers, up to the length of a man, were used as offerings, often by burning them.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 86 Another important paper item for rituals was paper cut in the form of long flags or trapezoids and painted with black rubber spots to depict the characteristic of the god being honored. At a certain time of year, these were also used to ask for rain. At this time, the papers were colored blue with plumage at the spearhead.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 87 Colonial period to 20th century When the Spanish arrived, they noted the production of codices and paper, which was also made from maguey and palm fibers as well as bark. It was specifically noted by Pedro M√°rtir de Angler√≠a.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 82 After the Conquest, indigenous paper, especially bark paper lost its value as a tribute item not only because the Spanish preferred European paper but also because bark paper's connection to indigenous religion caused it to be banned. The justification for the banning of amate was that it was used for magic and witchcraft. This was part of the Spaniard's efforts to mass convert the indigenous to Catholicism, which included the mass burning of codices, which contained most of the native history as well as cultural and natural knowledge. Only 16 of 500 surviving codices were written before the Conquest. The other, post-conquest books were written on bark paper although a few were written on European paper, cotton, or animal hides. They were largely the work of missionaries, such as Bernardino de Sahag√∫n, who were interested in recording the history and knowledge of the indigenous people. Some of the important codices of this type include Codex Sierra, Codex La Cruz Badiano and Codex Florentino. The Codex Mendocino was commissioned by viceroy Antonio de Mendoza in 1525 to learn about the tribute system and other indigenous practices to be adapted to Spanish rule. However, it is on European paper.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 91-92 Although bark paper was banned, it did not completely disappear. In the early colonial period, there was a shortage of European paper, which made it necessary to use the indigenous version on occasion. During the evangelization process, amate, along with a paste made from corn canes was appropriated by missionaries to create Christian images, mostly in the 16th and 17th century. In addition, among the indigenous, paper continued to be made clandestinely for ritual purposes. In 1569, friar Diego de Mendoza observed several indigenous carrying offerings of paper, copal and woven mats to the lakes inside the Nevado de Toluca volcano as offerings. The most successful at keeping paper making traditions alive were certain indigenous groups living in the La Huasteca, Ixhuatl√°n and Chicontepec in the north of Veracruz and some villages in Hidalgo. The only records of bark paper making after the early 1800s refer to these areas.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 93-94 Most of these areas are dominated by the Otomi and the area's ruggedness and isolation from central Spanish authority allowed small villages to keep small quantities of paper in production. In fact, this clandestine nature helped it to survive as a way to defy Spanish culture and reaffirm identity. Later 20th century to the present The Aztec calendar stone painted on amate Painting on amate by Citlalli Arregu√≠n in an exhibit at Garros Galer√≠a, Mexico City By the mid-20th century, the knowledge of making amate paper was kept alive only in a few small towns in the rugged mountains of Puebla and Veracruz states, such as San Pablito, an Otomi village and Chicontepec, a Nahua village.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 94 It was particularly strong in San Pablito in Puebla as many of the villages around it believed this paper has special power when used in rituals.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 94-97 The making of paper here until the 1960s was strictly the purview of the shamans, who kept the process secret, making paper primarily to be used for cutting gods and other figures for ritual. However, these shamans came into contact with anthropologists, learning of the interest that people on the outside had for their paper and their culture.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 104 But although the ritual cutting of paper remained important for the Otomi people of northern Puebla, the use of amate paper was declining, with industrial paper or tissue paper replacing amate paper in rituals.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 103, 115, 105 One stimulus for amate's commercialization was the shamans' growing realization of the commercial value of the paper; they began to sell cutouts of bark paper figures on a small scale in Mexico City along with other Otomi handcrafts. What the sale of these figures did was to make the bark paper a commodity. The paper was not sacred until and unless a shaman cut it as part of a ritual. The making of the paper and non-ritualistic cutting did not interfere with the ritual aspects of paper in general. This allowed a product formerly reserved only for ritual to become something with market value as well. It also allowed the making of paper to become open to the population of San Pablito and not only to shamans.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 103, 115, 80 However, most amate paper is sold as the backing for paintings made by Nahua artists from Guerrero state. There are various stories as to how painting on bark paper came about but they are divided between whether it was a Nahua or an Otomi idea. However, it is known that both Nahua and Otomi sold crafts at the Bazar del S√°bado in San √Ångel in Mexico City in the 1960s. The Otomi were selling paper and other crafts and the Nahua were selling their traditionally painted pottery.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 106 The Nahua transferred many of their pottery painting designs onto amate paper, which is easier to transport and sell.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 105 The Nahua called the paintings by their word for bark paper, which is \\"amatl.\\" Today, the word is applied to all crafts which use the paper. The new painting form found great demand from the start, and at first, the Nahua would buy almost all of the Otomi's paper production. Painting on bark paper quickly spread to various villages in Guerrero and by the end of the 1960s, became the most important economic activity in eight Nahua villages Ameyaltepec, Oapan, Ahuahuapan, Ahuelican, Analco, San Juan Tetelcingo, Xalitla and Maxela. (page 106) Each Nahua village has its own painting styles developed from the tradition of painting ceramics, and this allowed works to be classified. The rise of amate paper occurred during a time when government policies towards rural indigenous people and their crafts were changing, with the latter being encourage especially to help develop the tourism industry. FONART became part of the consolidation of distribution efforts for amate paper. Much of this involved buying all of the Otomi production of bark paper to ensure that the Nahua would have sufficient supplies. Although this intervention lasted for only about two years, it was crucial for developing sales of amate crafts in national and international markets.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 107 Since then, while the Nahua are still the principle buyers of Otomi amate paper, the Otomi have since branched out into different types of paper and have developed some of their own products to sell. Today, amate paper is one of the most widely distributed Mexican handcrafts nationally and internationally. It has received artistic and academic attention at both levels as well. In 2006, an annual event called the Encuentro de Arte in Papel Amate was begun in the village, which includes events such as processions, Dance of the Voladors, Huapango music and more. The main event is the exhibition of works by various artists such as Francisco Toledo, Sergio Hern√°ndez, Gabriel Macotela, Gustavo MOnrroy, Cecilio S√°nchez, Nicol√°s de Jes√∫s, David Correa, H√©ctor Montiel, Jos√© Montiel, Laura Montiel, Santiago Regalado Juan Manuel de la Rosa, Ester Gonz√°lez, Alejandra Palma Padilla, Nic√©foro Hurbieta Moreles, Jorge Lozano and Alfonso Garc√≠a Tellez. The Museo de Arte Popular and the Egyptian embassy in Mexico held an exhibition in 2008 on amate and papyrus with over sixty objects on display comparing the two ancient traditions. One of the most noted artists in the medium is shaman Alfonso Margarito Garc√≠a T√©llez, who has exhibited his work in museums such as the San Pedro Museo de Arte in Puebla. San Pablito While amate is made in a few small villages in northern Puebla, northern Veracruz and southern Hidalgo state, only San Pablito in Puebla manufactures the paper commercially. San Pablito is a village in the municipality of Pahuatl√°n located in the Sierra Norte de Puebla. Tulancingo, Hidalgo is the closest urban center. The area is very mountainous and the village itself is on the side of a mountain called the Cerro del Brujo. The making of the paper is the primary economic activity of the community and has alleviated poverty in the village. Before the villagers only had very small houses made of wood, but now they have much larger houses made of block. The paper makers here guard the process greatly and will sever contact with anyone seeking to replicate their work.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 148 In addition to providing income to the paper makers themselves the craft has been employing an increasing number of people to harvest bark, over an area which now extends over 1,500km2 in the Sierra Norte de Puebla region. The village manufactures large quantities of paper, still using mostly pre-Hispanic technology and various tree species for raw material. About half of this paper production is still sold to Nahua painters in Guerrero.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 10 Paper making has not only brought money into the Otomi population of the community but political clout as well. It is now the most important community economically in the municipality of Pahuatl√°n, and the last three municipal governments have been headed by an Otomi, which had not happened before.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 9 However, most of the paper making is done by women. One reason for this is that many men still migrate out of the community to work, mostly to the United States. These two sources of income are combined in many households in San Pablito.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 146 The economic problems of the late 2000s cut sales by about half forcing more to migrate out for work. Before the crisis, the inhabitants of the village were making two thousand sheets per day. Ritual use While the paper has been commercialized in San Pablito, it has not lost its ritual character here or in other areas such as Texcatepec and Chicontepec, where it is still made for ritual purposes. In these communities, the making and ritual use of paper is similar. Figures are cut from light or dark paper, which each figure and each color having significance. There are two types of paper. Light or white paper is used for images of gods or humans. Dark paper is connected with evil characters or sorcery.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 99‚Äì101 In Chicontepec, the light paper is made from mulberry trees, and the dark paper is made from classic amate or fig trees. The older the tree the darker the paper. Ritual paper acquires a sacred value only when shamans cut it ritually.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 116 The cutting technique is most important, not necessarily artistic although many have aesthetic qualities. In San Pablito, the cut outs are of gods or supernatural beings related to the indigenous worldview, but never of Catholic figures. Most of the time, the cut out ceremonies relate to petitions such as good crops and health, although as agriculture declines in importance economically, petitions for health and protection have become more important. One particularly popular ceremony is related to young men who have returned from working abroad. In Chicontepec, there are cut outs related to gods or spirits linked to natural phenomena such as lightning, rain, mountains, mangos seeds and more, with those cut from dark paper called \\"devils\\" or represent evil spirits. However, figures can also represent people living or dead. Those made of light paper represent good spirits and people who make promises. Female figures are distinguished by locks of hair. Some figures have four arms and two heads in profile, and other have the head and tail of an animal. Those with shoes represent mestizos or bad people who have died in fights, accidents or by drowning, also women who have died in childbirth or children who disrespect their parents. Those without shoes represent indigenous people or good people who have died in sickness or old age. Bad spirits represented in dark paper are burned ceremoniously in order to end their bad influence. Those in light paper are kept as amulets. The origin of the use of these cut outs is not known. It may extend back to the pre-Hispanic period, but there are now 16th century chronicles documenting the practice. It may have been a post Conquest invention, after the Spanish destroyed all other forms of representing the gods. It was easy to carry, mold, make and hide. Many of the religious concepts related to the cut outs do have pre-Hispanic roots. However, during the colonial period, the Otomi, especially of San Pablito were accused numerous times of witchcraft involving the use of cut outs.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 101‚Äì102 Today, some cut out figures are being reinterpreted and sold as handcraft products or folk art, and the use of industrial paper for ritual is common as well. Cut outs made for sale often relate to gods of agriculture, which are less called upon in ritual. These cut outs are also not exactly the same as those made for ritual, with changes made in order to keep the ritual aspect separate. In San Pablito, the making and cutting of paper is not restricted to shamans, as the rest of the villagers may engage in this. However, only shamans may do paper cutting rituals and the exact techniques of paper making is guarded by the residents of the village from outsiders. The best known shaman related to cut out ritual is Alfonso Garc√≠a T√©llez of San Pablito. He strongly states that the cutting rituals are not witchcraft, but rather a way to honor the spirits of the natural world and a way to help those who have died, along with their families. Garc√≠a T√©llez also creates cut out books about the various Otomi deities, which he has not only sold but also exhibited at museums such as the San Pedro Museo de Arte in Puebla. Amate products Otomi amate paper cut out on display at the Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City Amate paper is one of a number of paper crafts of Mexico, along with papel picado and papier-m√¢ch√© (such as Judas figures, alebrijes or decorative items such as strands of chili peppers called ristras). However, amate paper has been made as a commodity only since the 1960s. Prior to that time, it was made for mostly ritual purposes. The success of amate paper has been as the base for the creation of other products based both in traditional Mexican handcraft designs and more modern uses. Because of the product's versatility, both Otomi artisans and others have developed a number of variations to satisfy the tastes a various handcraft consumers.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 80, 2-7, 111 The paper is sold plain, dyed in a variety of colors and decorated with items such as dried leaves and flowers. Although the Nahua people of Guerrero remain the principal buyers of Otomi paper,L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 135 other wholesale buyers have used it to create products such as lampshades, notebooks, furniture covers, wallpaper, fancy stationery and more.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 2-7,10,111, 114 The Otomi themselves have innovated by creating paper products such as envelopes, book separators, invitation cards as well as cut out figures mostly based on traditional ritual designs. The Otomi have also established two categories of paper, standard quality and that produced for the high-end market, geared to well known Nahua artists and other artists that prize the paper's qualities. This is leading to a number of paper makers to be individually recognized like master craftsmen in other fields.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 111, 142 The Otomi paper makers generally sell their production to a limited number of wholesalers, because of limited Spanish skills and contact with the outside. This means about ten wholesalers controlling the distribution of about half of all Otomi production. These wholesalers, as well as artisans such as the Nahua who use the paper as the basis of their own work, have many more contacts and as a result, retail sales of the product are wide-ranging and varied both within Mexico and abroad. Amate paper products are still sold on the streets and markets in Mexico, much as commercialization of the produce began in the 20th century, often in venues that cater to tourists. However, through wholesalers, the paper also ends up in handicraft stores, open bazaars, specialty shops and the Internet. Much of it is used to create paintings, and the finest of these have been exhibited in both national and international museums and galleries. The paper is sold retail in the town to tourists as well as in shops in cities such as Oaxaca, Tijuana, Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey and Puebla. It is also exported to the United States, especially to Miami. However, about 50 percent of all Otomi paper production is still done in standard 40 cm by 60 cm size and sold to Nahua painters from Guerrero, the market segment which made the mass commercialization of the product possible.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 111, 135, 142 105 Seventy percent of all the craft production of these Otomi and Nahuas is sold on the national market with about thirty percent reaching the international market.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 142 As most amate paper is sold as the backing for these paintings, many consumers assume the Nahua produce the paper as well.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 112 The amate paper paintings are a combination of Nahua and Otomi traditions. The Otomi produce the paper, and the Nahua have transferred and adapted painting traditions associated with ceramics to the paper. The Nahuatl word \\"amate\\" is applied to both the paper and the paintings done on the paper. Each Nahua village has its own painting style which was developed for ceramics, originally commercialized in Acapulco and other tourist areas as early as the 1940s. The adaption of this painting to amate paper came in the 1960s and quickly spread to various villages until it became the primary economic activity in eight Nahua villages in Guerrero, Ameyaltepec, Oapan, Ahuahuapan, Ahuelican, Analco, San Juan Tetelcingo, Xalitla and Maxela.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 105‚Äì106 The paper is that it evokes Mexico's pre-Columbian past in addition to the customary designs painted on it.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 109 The success of these paintings led to the Nahuas buying just about all of the Otomis' paper production in that decade. It also attracted the attention of the government, which was taking an interest in indigenous crafts and promoting them to tourists. The FONART agency became involved for two years, buying Otomi paper to make sure that the Nahua had sufficient supplies for painting. This was crucial for the development of national and international markets for the paintings and the paper. It also worked to validate the \\"new\\" craft as legitimate, using symbols of past and present minority peoples as part of Mexican identity. The paintings started with and still mostly based on traditional designs from pottery although there has been innovation since then. Painted designs began focusing on birds and flowers on the paper. Experimentation led to landscape painting, especially scenes related to rural life such as farming, fishing, weddings, funerals and religious festivals. It even has included the painting of picture frames.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 110 Some painters have become famous in their own right for their work. Painter Nicol√°s de Jes√∫s, from Ameyaltepec has gained international recognition for his paintings, exhibiting abroad in countries such as France, Germany, England and Italy. His works generally touch on themes such as death, oppression of indigenous peoples and various references to popular culture in his local community. Others have innovated ways to speed up the work, such as using silk-screen techniques to make multiple copies.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 125 While the Nahua paintings remain the most important craft form related to amate paper, the Otomi have adopted their elaborate cut out figures to the commercial market as well. This began with shamans creating booklets with miniature cut outs of gods with handwritten explanations. Eventually, these began to sell and this success led to their commercialization in markets in Mexico City, were the Otomi connected with the Nahua in the 1960s. The Otomi still sell cut outs in traditional designs, but have also experimented with newer designs, paper sizes, colors and types of paper. These cut outs include depictions of various gods, especially those related to beans, coffee, corn, pineapples, tomatoes and rain. However, these cut outs are not 100% authentic, with exact replicas still reserved to shamans for ritual purposes. Innovation has included the development of books, and cut outs of suns, flowers, birds, abstract designs from traditional beadwork and even Valentine hearts with painted flowers. Most cut outs are made of one type of paper, then glued onto a contrasting background. Their sizes range from miniatures in booklets to sizes large enough to frame and hang like a painting.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 113 The production and sale of these paper products have brought tourism to San Pablito, mostly from Hidalgo, Puebla and Mexico City, but some come from the far north and south of Mexico and even from abroad.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 138 Manufacture Hand lain grid of wet bark fibers before flattening. San Pablito, Puebla, Mexico The fibers are flattened with a flat volcanic rock. The chalk lines on the board serve as guides.San Pablito, Puebla, Mexico A partially flattened mass of fibers being smoothed with orange peel for demonstration.San Pablito, Puebla, Mexico While there have been some minor innovations, amate paper is still made using the same basic process that was used in the pre-Hispanic period.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 123-124 The process begins with obtaining the bark for its fiber. Traditionally, these are from trees of the fig (Ficus) family as this bark is the easiest to process. Some large Ficus trees are considered sacred and can be found surrounded with candles and offering of cut amate paper. Primary species used include F. cotinifolia, F. padifolia and F. petiolaris, the classic amate tree, along with several non-ficus species such as Morus celtidifolia, Citrus anurantifolia and Heliocarpos Donnell-Smithii Rose. However, the taxonomical identification of trees used for amate paper production is not exact, leading estimates of wild supplies inaccurate.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 17 The softer inner bark is preferred but other parts are used as well. Outer bark and bark from ficus trees tend to make darker paper and inner bark and mulberry bark tends to make lighter paper. Bark is best cut in the spring when it is new, which does less damage. It also is less damaging to take bark from older ficus trees as this bark tends to peel off more easily. The commercialization of the product has meant that a wider range of area needs to be searched for appropriate trees. This has specialized the harvesting of bark to mostly people from outside San Pablito, with only a few paper makers harvesting their own bark.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 123 These bark collectors generally come to the village at the end of the week, but numbers of harvesters and amount of bark can vary greatly, depending on the time of year and other factors.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 8 The paper makers generally buy the bark fresh then dry it for storage. After drying, the bark can be conserved for about a year. From the beginning of commercialization, the making of a paper brought in most of the village's population into the process in one way or another. However, in the 1980s, many men in the area began to leave as migrant workers, mostly to the United States, sending remittances home. This then became the main source of income to San Pablito, and made paper making not only secondary, but mostly done by women.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 123,125 The basic equipment used are stones to beat the fibers, wooden boards, and pans to boil the bark. All of these come from sources outside San Pablito. The stones come from Tlaxcala. The boards come from two nearby villages of Zoyotla and Honey and the boiling pans are obtained by local hardware stores from Tulancingo.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 130 In the pre-Hispanic period, the bark was first soaked for a day or more to soften it before it was worked. An innovation documented from at least the 20th century is to boil the bark instead, which is faster. To shorten the boiling time, ashes or lime were introduced into the water, later replaced by industrial caustic soda. With the last ingredient, the actual boiling time is between three and six hours, although with set up the process takes anywhere from half to a full day. It can only be done during certain weather conditions (dry days) and it requires constant attention. The amount boiled at one time ranges from 60 to 90 kg with 3.5 kg of caustic soda. The bark needs to be stirred constantly. After boiling, the bark is then rinsed in clean water.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 124-125 The softened fibers are kept in water until they are processed. This needs to be done as quickly as possible so that they do not rot.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 124, 127 At this stage, chlorine bleach may be added to either lighten the paper entirely or to create a mix of shades to create a marbled effect. This step has become necessary due to the lack of naturally light bark fibers.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 126 If the paper is to be colored, strong industrial dyes are used. These can vary from purple, red, green or pink, whatever the demand is.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 127 Wooden boards are sized to the paper being made. They are rubbed with soap so that the fibers do not stick. The fibers are arranged on wooden boards and beaten together into a thin flat mass. The best paper is made with long fibers arranged in a grid pattern to fit the board. Lesser quality paper is made from short masses arranged more haphazardly, but still beaten to the same effect.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 8, 124, 127 This maceration process liberates soluble carbohydrates that are in the cavities of the cell fibers and act as a kind of glue. The Ficus tree bark contains a high quantity of this substance allowing to make for firm but flexible paper. During the process, the stones are kept moist to keep the paper from sticking to it. The finished flat mass is then usually smoothed over with rounded orange peels. If there are any gaps after the maceration process, these are usually filled in by gluing small pieces of paper.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 12, 129 Remaining on their boards, the pounded sheets are taken outside to dry. Drying times vary due to weather conditions. On dry and sunny days, this can take an hour or two, but in humid conditions it can take days.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 124, 128 If the dried sheets are to be sold wholesale, they are then simply bundled. If to be sold retail, the edges are then trimmed with a blade.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 129 The production process in San Pablito has mostly evolved to make paper as quickly as possible, with labor being divided and specialized and new tools and ingredients added towards this end.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, page 117 Almost all production facilities are family based, but the level of organization varies. Most paper making is done inside the home by those who are dedicated to it either full or part-time. If the paper is made only part-time, then the work is done sporadically and usually only by women and children. A more recent phenomenon is the development of large workshops which hire artisans to do the work, supervised by the family which owns the enterprise. These are often established by families who have invested money sent home by migrant worker into materials and equipment.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 131-132 Most of the production of all these facilities is plain sheet of 40 cm by 60 cm, but the larger workshops make the greatest variety of products including giant sheets of 1.2 by 2.4 meters in size.L√≥pez Binnq√ºist, pages 129,132 Ecological concerns  The commercialization of amate paper has had negative environmental effects. In pre-Hispanic times, bark was taken only from the branches of adult trees, allowing for regeneration. Ficus trees should be optimally no younger than 25 years old before cutting. At that age the bark almost peels off by itself and does less damage to the tree. Other trees such as mulberry do not have to mature as much. The pressure to provide large quantities of bark means that it is taken from younger trees as well. This is negatively affecting the ecosystem of northern Puebla and forcing harvesters to take bark from other species as well as from a wider range, moving into areas such as Tlaxco. Another problem is the introduction of caustic soda and other industrial chemicals into the process, which not only gets into the environment and water supply, can also directly poison artisans who do not handle it properly. Fondo Nacional para el Fomento de las Artesan√≠as (FONART), the Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana-Iztapalapa, the Universidad Veracruzana and the Instituto de Artesan√≠as e Industrias Populares de Puebla have been working on ways to make amate paper making more sustainable. One aspect is to manage the collection of bark. Another is to find a substitute for caustic soda to soften and prepare the fibers without losing quality. Not only is the soda polluting, it has had negative effects on artisans' health. As of 2010, the group has reported advances in its investigations such as ways of including new types of bark from other species. In addition, the Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Superiores en Antropolog√≠a Social (CIESAS) is urging a reforestation plan in order to implement a more sustainable supply of bark.

The NK designation is derived from the initials of chief designer Nikolay Kuznetsov. The NK-33 was among the most powerful LOX/RP-1 rocket engines when it was built, with a high specific impulse and low structural mass. They were intended for the ill-fated Soviet N-1 moon rocket. The NK-33A rocket engine is now used on the first stage of the Soyuz-2-1v launch vehicle.  Design  The NK-33 series engines are high- pressure, regeneratively cooled staged combustion cycle bipropellant rocket engines. They use oxygen-rich preburners to drive the turbopumps. The turbopumps require subcooled liquid oxygen (LOX) to cool the bearings. These kinds of burners are highly unusual, since their hot, oxygen-rich exhaust tends to attack metal, causing burn-through failures. The United States had not investigated oxygen-rich combustion technologies until the Integrated Powerhead Demonstrator project in the early 2000s.U.S. Air Force-NASA Technology Demonstrator Engine for Future Launch Vehicles Successfully Fired During Initial Full Duration Test. The Soviets, however, perfected the metallurgy behind this method. The nozzle was constructed from corrugated metal, brazed to an outer and inner lining, giving a simple, light, but strong structure. In addition, since the NK-33 uses LOX and RP-1 as propellants, which have similar densities, a single rotating shaft could be used for both turbopumps.Astronautix NK-33 entry . The NK-33 engine has among the highest thrust-to-weight ratio of any Earth-launchable rocket engine, only NPO Energomash RD-253 and SpaceX Merlin 1D engine achieve a higher ratio. The specific impulse of the NK-33 is significantly higher than both of these engines. The NK-43 is similar to the NK-33, but is designed for an upper stage, not a first stage. It has a longer nozzle, optimized for operation at altitude, where there is little to no ambient air pressure. This gives it a higher thrust and specific impulse, but makes it longer and heavier. It has a thrust-to-weight ratio of about 120:1.Astronautix NK-43 entry The predecessors of NK-33 and NK-43 are the earlier NK-15 and NK-15V engines respectively. The oxygen-rich technology lives on in the RD-170/-171 engines, their RD-180, and recently developed RD-191 derivatives, but these engines have no direct connection to the NK-33.  History = N-1  The N-1 launcher originally used NK-15 engines for its first stage and a high-altitude modification (NK-15V) in its second stage. After four consecutive launch failures and no successes, the project was cancelled. While other aspects of the vehicle were being modified or redesigned, Kuznetsov improved his contributions into the NK-33 and NK-43 respectively.Lindroos, Marcus. The Soviet Manned Lunar Program Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Accessed: 4 October 2011. The 2nd-generation vehicle was to be called the N-1F. By this point the Moon race was long lost, and the Soviet space program was looking to the Energia as its heavy launcher. No N-1F ever reached the launch pad. When the N-1 program was shut down, all work on the project was ordered destroyed. A bureaucrat instead took the engines, worth millions of dollars each, and stored them in a warehouse. Word of the engines eventually spread to the US. Nearly 30 years after they were built, rocket engineers were led to the warehouse. One of the engines was later taken to the US, and the precise specification of the engine was demonstrated on a test stand.  Combustion- chamber design  The NK-33 closed-cycle technology works by sending the auxiliary engines' exhaust into the main combustion chamber. This made the engine design unique. This technology was believed to be impossible by Western rocket engineers. The fully heated liquid O2 flows through the pre-burner and into the main chamber in this design. The extremely hot oxygen-rich mixture made the engine dangerous: it was known to melt thick castings \\"like candle wax\\". One of the controversies in the Kremlin over supplying the engine to the US was that the design of the engine was similar to Russian ICBM engine design. The NK-33's design was used in the later RD-180 engine, which had twice the size of the NK-33. The RD-180 engines were used (as of 2016) to power the Atlas V rocket. This company also acquired a license for the production of new engines. Sale of engines to Aerojet About 60 engines survived in the \\"Forest of Engines\\", as described by engineers on a trip to the warehouse. In the mid-1990s, Russia sold 36 engines to Aerojet General for $1.1 million each, shipping them to the company facility in Sacramento CA. During the engine test in Sacramento, the engine hit its specifications. Aerojet has modified and renamed the updated NK-33 to AJ26-58, AJ-26-59 and AJ26-62, and NK-43 to AJ26-60.  Kistler K-1  Kistler Aerospace, later called Rocketplane Kistler (RpK), designed their K-1 rocket around three NK-33s and an NK-43. On August 18, 2006, NASA announced that RpK had been chosen to develop Commercial Orbital Transportation Services for the International Space Station. The plan called for demonstration flights between 2008 and 2010. RpK would have received up to $207 million if they met all NASA milestones, but on September 7, 2007, NASA issued a default letter, warning that it would terminate the COTS agreement with Rocketplane Kistler in 30 days because RpK had not met several contract milestones.  Antares  Antares rocket being rolled out for testing, showing the two NK-33 engines The initial version of the Orbital Sciences Antares light-to-medium-lift launcher had two modified NK-33 in the first stage, a solid Castor 30-based second stage and an optional solid or hypergolic third stage. The NK-33s were imported from Russia to the United States, modified, and re-designated as Aerojet AJ26s. This involved removing some electrical harnessing, adding U.S. electronics, qualifying it for U.S. propellants, and modifying the steering system. In 2010 stockpiled NK-33 engines were successfully tested for use by the Orbital Sciences Antares light-to-medium-lift launcher. The Antares rocket was successfully launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on April 21, 2013. This marked the first successful launch of the NK-33 heritage engines built in early 1970s. Aerojet agreed to recondition sufficient NK-33s to serve Orbital's 16-flight NASA Commercial Resupply Services contract. Beyond that, it had a stockpile of 23 1960s- and 1970s-era engines. Kuznetsov no longer manufactures the engines, so Orbital sought to buy RD-180 engines. Because NPO Energomash's contract with United Launch Alliance prevented this, Orbital sued ULA, alleging anti-trust violations. Aerojet offered to work with Kuznetsov to restart production of new NK-33 engines, to assure Orbital of an ongoing supply. However, manufacturing defects in the engine's liquid-oxygen turbopump and design flaws in the hydraulic balance assembly and thrust bearings were proposed as two possible causes of the 2014 Antares launch failure. As announced on 5 November 2014, Orbital decided to drop the AJ-26 first stage from the Antares and source an alternative engine. On 17 December 2014, Orbital Sciences announced that it would use the NPO Energomash RD-181 on second-generation Antares launch vehicles and had contracted directly with NPO Energomash for up to 60 RD-181 engines. Two engines are used on the first stage of the Antares 100-series.  Current and proposed uses  RSC Energia is proposing an \\"Aurora-L.SK\\" launch vehicle, which would use an NK-33 to power the first stage and a Blok DM-SL for the second stage.  Soyuz-2-1v  In the early 2010s the Soyuz launch vehicle family was retrofitted with the NK-33 engine ‚Äì using the lower weight and greater efficiency to increase payload; the simpler design and use of surplus hardware might actually reduce cost. TsSKB-Progress uses the NK-33 as the first-stage engine of the lightweight version of the Soyuz rocket family, the Soyuz-2-1v. The NK-33A intended for the Soyuz-2-1v was successfully hot-fired on 15 January 2013, following a series of cold-fire and systems tests of the fully assembled Soyuz-1 in 2011‚Äì2012.http://www.kosmonavtika.com/lanceurs/soyouz/version/14A15/14A15.html The NK-33 powered rocket was finally designated Soyuz-2-1v, with its maiden flight having taken place on 28 December 2013. One NK-33 engine replaces the Soyuz's central RD-108, with the four boosters of the first stage omitted. A version of the Soyuz rocket with four boosters powered by NK-33 engines (with one engine per booster) has not been built, which results in a reduced payload compared to the Soyuz-2 launch vehicle.  Versions  During the years there have been many versions of this engine: * NK-15 (GRAU index 11D51): Initial version for the N1 first stage. * NK-15V (GRAU index 11D52): Modified NK-15 optimized for vacuum operation, used on the N1 second stage. * NK-33 (GRAU index 11D111): Improved version for the N1F first stage, never flown. * NK-43 (GRAU index 11D112): Vacuum-optimized NK-33 for the N1F second stage, never flown. * AJ26-58 and AJ26-59: Modified NK-33 by Aerojet Rocketdyne. Planned used on the Kistler K-1. * AJ26-62: Modified NK-33 with additional gimbal mechanism by Aerojet Rocketdyne. Used on the Antares 100-series first stage. * NK-33A (GRAU index 14D15): Refurbished NK-33. Used on the Soyuz-2-1v first stage. * NK-33-1: Uprated NK-33 with gimbal mechanism.

It was on the prairie in buffalo country and was mainly used as a source of pemmican which was sent down the river to Fort Bas de la Rivi√®re at the mouth of the Winnipeg River. *(1787-1810) In 1787 Robert Grant of the North West Company established Fort Esperance on the south bank of the Qu'Appelle about one half mile below the mouth of Big Cut Arm Creek. It was about 150 feet square and the site was subject to flooding. Relations with the plains Indians were bad. According to a hearsay report in the journal of Alexander Henry the younger as of July 1810 it was destroyed and abandoned. *(1810-1814) A second fort was built on one of the Qu'Appelle lakes which operated for four years. During one of these years a brigade going downriver was ambushed and many of the men killed or wounded. *(1814-1816) In 1814 it was moved to the north bank of the river two miles west Parks Canada says 2 miles west, Losey says one half mile west of Big Cut Arm Creek and was renamed Fort John. It was 100 yards away from a Hudson's Bay post (called Fort Qu'Appelle and not to be confused with Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan built in 1855) that had been established the previous year. Fort John was inside a well-built stockade of 200 by 160 feet was the NWC's headquarters for the Assiniboine region. In the autumn of 1815, when the HBC men arrived for the winter's trade they found that their post had been burnt by the NWC. A week later the NWC men arrived. They made threats against the HBC men, but chose to do nothing. The following spring, when the HBC men took their furs downriver, the NWC attacked, took the men prisoner and burned the fort. The NWC men joined Cuthbert Grant and continued downriver and captured Brandon House. This operation culminated in the Battle of Seven Oaks in June 1816. The HBC responded by building a new post called Beaver Creek House on the Assiniboine River one and a half miles above the mouth of Beaver Creek. *(1816-1819) In the same year (1816) the NWC moved its fort to a hill on the south bank of the river 300 yards west of the original site. The post was closed in 1819 and in 1821 whatever was left was taken over by the HBC's Beaver Creek House. The Fort Esperance National Historic Site located nearby () was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1944. The XY post was a mile down river on the south bank. The location of the Qu'Appelle lake site is unknown. One source suggests Round Lake 35 km west.

Svartr√• is a former village and parish in Falkenberg Municipality, Sweden with about 200 citizens. It formed a parish until 2006, when the parish merged with K√∂inge and Okome parishes to form Okome parish. It was a municipality between 1863 and 1951. A brook, Svart√•n, flows through the area. It is likely to have given name to the village which in turn gave the parish its name. Svartr√• was first mentioned in 1461, then spelt Swa[r]teraa. Svart means black, while r√• means owner's mark or border. The children usually attend Okome school until the age of 12, after which they attend Apelskolan in Ullared. However, the children in the northernmost part of the area spend all their compulsory education at Apelskolan. The area is a political stronghold for the Centre Party which usually gains around 50 percent of the votes. Geography and geology Svartr√• is bordered on the east by H√∂gvads√•n, of which Svart√•n is a tributary. The southern and eastern parts of the area are predominantly cultivated farmland, while the northern and western parts are covered by forests. The ratio between cultivated and forested areas, however, has fluctuated considerably throughout history and the parish was almost free of any forest as late as in the early 20th century. Sumpafallen and Bj√∂rkekullen Nature Reserve are located in the area, the latter being a farm museum. As the ice receded during the last glacial period parts of Svartr√• formed a bay. Glacier rivers eroded the land and made it comparatively hilly. History Some remains from the Stone Age have been found, such as flint objects and arrow points. There are Bronze Age and Iron Age remains in the vicinity of the church, as well as Bronze Age remains at V√•rdh√∂gen, a hill top. The church dates back to the 12th century and has survived several planned demolitions. The village was split up due to agricultural reforms in the mid 19th century (laga skifte). Falkenberg railway and Varberg-√Ñtran railway had stations in Svartr√•hed and Skinnarlyngen in the first part of the 20th century. Svartr√• had a school in one form or another from about 1850 to 1960. The population topped during the later part of the 19th century, when it reached about 500 people. It was depopulated during most of the 20th century, until a population of about 200 people was reached. It has remained on that level for the last decades. Economy Svartr√• has never been home to any major industrial activity, although it has had a few minor sawmills as well as a gravel pit.

She was originally intended as a mount for Peggy, but as a young horse, Brentina threw Mrs. Thomas off and McDonald kept her as a ride. The mare has since had incredible success at the international level in dressage, becoming one of the most successful U.S. horses in history, mainly due to her excellent work ethic and the partnership she shares with her rider. In 2003, Brentina underwent surgery to correct a breathing problem, caused by a paralyzed windpipe, that restricted air intake to 30% of normal capacity. After a mild tendon strain at the 2004 CDI*** in Dortmund, Germany, McDonald and the Thomas' decided not to compete the mare in the upcoming Athens Olympics selection trials. However, due to their #1 standing in the USEF Grand Prix Rankings, and after a recommendation by Klaus Balkenhol, the U.S. Dressage Team Coach, the Committee on Selections of the United States Equestrian Federation added her to the short list for the Olympic Games. Brentina was also named to the 2006 World Equestrian Games team. She completed the team competition, finishing with a very good score and helping the Americans to a bronze medal. However, her rider felt a few tentative steps during the extended trot, and decided not to ride in the individual competition, fearing it might be a sign of injury and another ride might lead to serious injury. After a full work-up in the States, scanning the tendon, the veterinarians found diagnosed the injury as a strain, and treated it with A Cell. Brentina is expected to fully recover and return to work. On February 10, 2009, Brentina underwent surgery for colic. McDonald reported a few days later that she was on the mend and recovering well. She remained at the veterinary facility until February 23. Brentina was retired from competition on April 17 at the Las Vegas 2009 World Cup. Brentina has also been made into a Breyer horse model.

The 2000 census reported a population of 2,611 persons.Wadmalaw Island: Census Tract 22, Charleston County, South Carolina United States Census Bureau History Wadmalaw Island was landed upon by Captain Robert Sandford and the crew of the Berkeley Bay in mid-June 1666 after an excursion up the Bohicket Creek. It is believed that Sandford landed where Rockville, South Carolina now sits. On June 23, 1666, Captain and crew carried out the ritual of turf and twig, claiming the land for England and the Lords Proprietors.Zepke, Terrance. Coastal South Carolina: Welcome to the Low Country. Pineapple Press, Inc., 2006. p. 155 In 1670, 148 colonists arrived and settled on the west bank of the Ashley (Kiawah) River. They survived the first four years of poor crop production through the generosity of natives who shared beans and corn. They later moved to what is now Charleston.Zepke, Terrance. Coastal South Carolina: Welcome to the Low Country. Pineapple Press, Inc., 2006. p. 155 In 1890, planters organized the first sailing regatta at Rockville, less than a mile from the tea garden. The 120th Rockville Regatta was held in August, 2010. In more recent times, The Lipton Tea Company operated an experimental tea farm on Wadmalaw Island from 1960 until 1987, when it was sold to Mack Fleming and Bill Hall. These gentlemen converted the experimental farm into a working tea Garden. The Charleston Tea Garden utilized a converted cotton picker and tobacco harvester to mechanically harvest the tea.Franklin PM, Mikula N. Backroads of South Carolina: a Guide to South Carolina‚Äôs Most Scenic Backroad Adventures. Voyageur Press, 2006 p. 37 The Charleston Tea Garden sold tea mail order known as American Classic Tea and also produced Sam's Choice Instant Tea, sold through Sam's Clubs. American Classic Tea has been the official tea of the White House since 1987. In 2003, Bigelow Tea Company purchased the Charleston Tea Garden and temporarily closed the garden in order to renovate it.Franklin PM, Mikula N. Backroads of South Carolina: a Guide to South Carolina‚Äôs Most Scenic Backroad Adventures. Voyageur Press, 2006 p. 40 The garden reopened in January 2006. Tours are now offered of this last remaining working Tea Farm in America. Wadmalaw now produces Firefly, a sweet tea flavored vodka. It is popular throughout the Southern United States because of its recognizable flavor and cultural significance.  See also  *Charleston Tea Garden ReferencesExternal links *Yahoo!

When he was 13, he and two of his brothers formed a band called The Rack. At age 17, he joined the Scratch Band in Connecticut. Early career He played in many local bands until around 1980, when he started working in New York studios. While working in Manhattan, he joined the band Tom Dickie and the Desires, managed by Tommy Mottola, manager of Hall & Oates. Impressed by Curry's work, Mottola asked him to record with Hall & Oates on their album Private Eyes. He subsequently toured with Hall & Oates until 1986. Bryan Adams During the period he was playing with Hall & Oates, Curry met producer Bob Clearmountain, who had recently begun working with a young Bryan Adams, and appeared on Adams' second album, You Want It You Got It. His appearance on nearly all of Adams' subsequent albums coincided with his rise to prominence. Following his stint with Hall & Oates, Curry began touring full time with Adams, a collaboration that continues to this day.

The character is depicted as a member of the Acolytes. Fictional character biography Neophyte is a shy, quiet mutant with the ability to phase his body and others, allowing complete intangibility and high-speed transport through inanimate matter. Discovered by Cargill, Unuscione, and Milan in an abandoned church in Switzerland while praying for something to believe in, he accepted their invitation to join the group of Magneto followers known as the Acolytes. The youngest member of the group, he was assigned tasks of little importance and did not accompany the other Acolytes into battle. He was put in charge of feeding the captive Moira MacTaggert, but eventually discovered through her that their de facto leader, Fabian Cortez, had secretly murdered Magneto (though it would later be revealed that Magneto actually survived the attempt). Cortez used his own mutant power to amplify the powers of others to uncontrollable levels to jettison Neophyte from their headquarters, where he fell into a grotto. A woman came to his rescue, although he was confused about why a human would help a mutant. Suddenly, a trio of Acolytes appeared and killed the woman. This act caused him to rethink his loyalties towards Fabian Cortez and the Acolytes. He agreed to use his knowledge and powers to aid the X-Men in infiltrating the Acolytes' base of operations. After the conflict Neophyte was offered sanctuary with the X-Men, but declined the offer and departed alone to search for meaning on his own terms.Uncanny X-Men #300 Eventually, Neophyte was captured by the Acolytes and put on trial for the crime of treason after aiding the X-Men. The former X-Man Colossus decided to defend Neophyte in his case, opting for a second chance for the boy instead of the penalty of death that most of the other Acolytes wished for. Neophyte felt hopeless, fully expecting to be executed. Being prosecuted by Amelia Voght and judged by Exodus, Neophyte claimed the Acolytes as hypocrites, as they preached Magneto's way but were guilty of doing the same hatred and violence as those they condemned. When he mentioned Professor Charles Xavier's name, the Acolytes were sent into an uproar, only to be stopped by Exodus, who stated that Neophyte's death would only occur after the trial. Colossus stepped forward and managed to convince Exodus to banish Neophyte from Avalon, teleporting him back to Earth.Uncanny X-Men #315 (Aug 1994) Neophyte eventually returns to the Acolytes' ranks after Magneto resurfaces. Still among the more compassionate members, he is frequently ridiculed and is thought of as weak by several others. On the battlefield, however, he held his own, and proved to be a useful teammate. After M-Day Neophyte was one of the few mutants to survive Cassandra Nova's Sentinel attack on Genosha. Neophyte retained his mutant powers during the M-Day, and appeared briefly during X-Men: Messiah Complex among a small group of Acolytes.The Uncanny X-Men #492 (Jan. 2008) Later he moved to Utopia and was seen among the group of mutants, which were assembled by Cyclops to fight the invasion of Nimrods.New Mutants #14 Powers and abilities Neophyte is a phase-morpher, able to travel distances through mass by breaking down his physical structure and entering a solid material. When in contact with matter, Neophyte relaxes the molecular bonding forces in his body so that his molecules merge with the object he's touching in a non-substantial state. He can then cause the mass of his body to reform itself at a different angle or position to emerge from the object. When the Acolytes were based in a large French castle, he could merge his mass with one stone wall of the castle and reform himself a moment later out of any of the connecting stone surfaces. Later, on the rocky hillside of Wundagore, Neophyte could almost instantly relocate himself across the landscape by merging with the uniform earth and rock of the area. He could also separate his mass into multiple small masses, such as when he jumped off a balcony and disappeared into a rainstorm by dividing his mass up into the rain, only to reform later as the rain hit the ground below. He is able to carry several other people with him as he travels in this state, acting as a means of high-speed transport. The maximum distance he can travel and the maximum amount of mass he can transport are unknown. Other versions=Age of X In the Age of X reality, Neophyte is briefly mentioned in a report. After being captured, he is interrogated and forced to give information on Legacy and Magneto.http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id;=30188 ReferencesExternal links * Neophyte at Marvel Wiki * UncannyXmen.net Character Profile on Neophyte Category:Characters created by John Romita Jr. Category:Characters created by Scott Lobdell Category:Comics characters introduced in 1993 Category:Fictional characters who can turn intangible Category:Marvel Comics mutants Category:Marvel Comics supervillains ","title":"Neophyte (comics)"},{"id":"3813584","text":"James H. Pierce and Joan Burroughs Pierce starred in the 1932‚Äì34 Tarzan radio series James Hubert Pierce (August 8, 1900 ‚Äì December 11, 1983) was an American actor and the fourth actor to portray Tarzan on film. He appeared in films from 1924 to 1951.  Background  Pierce was born in Freedom, Indiana. He was an All-American center on the Indiana Hoosiers football team. Following his graduation in 1921, he coached high school football in Arizona, and began acting in his spare time. After he was cast in the 1923 production of The Deerslayer, he remained in California and coached football at Glendale High School (one of his players was John Wayne).  Portrayal of Tarzan  Pierce's life changed when he attended a party given by Edgar Rice Burroughs and his daughter Joan. Burroughs, the creator and author of the Tarzan books, immediately wanted Pierce to star in the next Tarzan movie. Pierce gave up a role in the film Wings to accept the Tarzan role. His part in Wings was given to a newcomer named Gary Cooper. The silent Tarzan film Burroughs talked him into accepting was released in 1927 by RKO Radio Pictures, and entitled Tarzan and the Golden Lion.  Marriage/radio career/later life  Pierce wed Joan Burroughs on August 8, 1928, his 28th birthday. From 1932 to 1936, James and Joan Pierce were the voices of Tarzan and Jane on national radio in Tarzan. They remained married until Joan's death in 1972. Both are buried in Shelbyville, Indiana, and their tombstones bear the inscriptions Tarzan and Jane. They had a daughter Joanne II Anselmo, n√©e Pierce (1930‚Äì2005), and a son James Michael Pierce (1935‚Äì1984). Pierce is also remembered for playing Prince Thun of the Lion Men in the 1936 serial film Flash Gordon. He acted in small roles in several films, mostly westerns, through 1951, and worked in a lucrative real estate agency in the San Fernando Valley. He was an accomplished pilot, active during World War II with the National Airmen's Reserve, the forerunner of today's Air National Guard. For many years, near the end of his life, Pierce attempted, to no avail, to find a print of Tarzan and the Golden Lion, which was thought lost. After his death, a copy was found in a foreign archive.

Life and career During the early 1930s he was a student at the Akademie der Tonkunst in Munich, where Carl Orff was his teacher. Orff thereafter remained a powerful influence on his music. Returning to Switzerland in the mid-1930s, Sutermeister devoted his life to composition. He wrote some works for the radio, starting with Die schwarze Spinne in 1936, before turning later to television opera. His most successful stage work was Romeo und Julia, premiered in Dresden in 1940 under Karl B√∂hm. Sutermeister's penultimate stage work, Madame Bovary, first given in Zurich in 1967, is loosely based on Flaubert's novel. With many characters cut, it consists largely of monologues for Emma Bovary, who was sung by Anneliese Rothenberger. For his final opera, he adapted Eug√®ne Ionesco's play Exit the King (Le Roi se meurt). According to musicologist Elizabeth Forbes, this opera, premiered in 1985 at Bavarian State Opera, with only six characters, a tiny chorus and a small orchestra is, in its modest way, as effective as anything Sutermeister wrote.Elizabeth Forbes.\\"Obituary: Heinrich Sutermeister.

He lived most of his life in Chile, although he spent many years in self-imposed exile in Mexico, the United States and Spain. Although he had left his country in the sixties for personal reasons, after 1973 he said his exile was also a form of protest against the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. He returned to Chile in 1981 and lived there until his death. Donoso is the author of a number of short stories and novels, which contributed greatly to the Latin American literary boom. His best known works include the novels Coronaci√≥n (Coronation), El lugar sin l√≠mites (Hell Has No Limits) and El obsceno p√°jaro de la noche (The Obscene Bird of Night). His works deal with a number of themes, including sexuality, the duplicity of identity, psychology, and a sense of dark humor. Early life Donoso was born in Santiago to the physician Jos√© Donoso Donoso and Alicia Y√°√±ez (Eliodoro Y√°√±ez's niece). He studied in The Grange School, where he was classmates with Luis Alberto Heiremans and Carlos Fuentes, and in Liceo Jos√© Victorino Lastarria (Jos√© Victorino Lastarria High School). Coming from a comfortable family, during his childhood he worked as a juggler and an office worker, much before he developed as a writer and teacher. In 1945 he traveled to the southernmost part of Chile and Argentina, where he worked on sheep farms in the province of Magallanes. Two years later, he finished high school and signed up to study English in the Institute of Teaching in the Universidad de Chile (University of Chile). In 1949, thanks to a scholarship from the Doherty Foundation, he changed to studying English literature at Princeton University, where he studied under such professors as R. P. Blackmur, Lawrence Thompson and Allan Tate. The Princeton magazine, MSS, published his first two stories, both written in English: \\"The Blue Woman\\" (1950) and \\"The Poisoned Pastries\\" (1951). Donoso graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English from Princeton in 1951 after completing a senior thesis titled \\"The Elegance of Mind of Jane Austen. An Interpretation of Her Novels Through the Attitudes of Heroines.\\" Career In 1951, he traveled to Mexico and Central America. He then returned to Chile and in 1954 started teaching English at the Universidad Cat√≥lica (Catholic University) and in the Kent School. His first book, Veraneo y otros cuentos (Summer Vacation and Other Stories), was published in 1955 and won the Premio Municipal de Santiago (Municipal Prize of Santiago) the following year. In 1957, while he lived with a family of fishermen in the Isla Negra, he published his first novel, Coronaci√≥n (Coronation), in which he described the high Santiaguina classes and their decadence. Eight years later, it was translated and published in the United States by Alfred A Knopf and in England by The Bodley Head. In 1958, he left Chile for Buenos Aires, returning to Chile in 1960. He started writing for the magazine Revista Ercilla in 1959 when he found himself traveling through Europe, from where he sent his reports. He continued as an editor and literary critic of that publication until 1964. He was also a co-editor of the Mexican journal Siempre. In 1961, he married the painter, writer and translator Mar√≠a del Pilar Serrano (1925‚Äì1997), also known as Mar√≠a Esther Serrano Mendieta, daughter of Juan Enrique Serrano Pell√© from Chile and Graciela Mendieta Alvarez from Bolivia. Donoso had previously met her in Buenos Aires. They left Chile again in 1965 for Mexico and later Donoso was a writer-in-residence at the University of Iowa from 1965 to 1967, when he moved with his wife to Spain. In 1968, the couple adopted a three-month-old girl from Madrid, whom they named Mar√≠a del Pilar Donoso Serrano, best known as Pilar Donoso. In 1981, after his return to Chile, he conducted a literature workshop in the which, during the first period, many writers like Roberto Brodsky, Marco Antonio de la Parra, Carlos Franz, Carlos Iturra, Eduardo Llanos, Marcelo Maturana, Sonia Montecino Aguirre, Dar√≠o Oses, Roberto Rivera and, very fleetingly, Jaime Collyer, Gonzalo Contreras, and Jorge Marchant Lazcano, among others. Later, Arturo Fontaine Talavera, Alberto Fuguet and √Ågata Gligo attended, among others. At the same time, he continued publishing novels, even though they didn't receive the same repercussions as preceding works: La desesperanza (Curfew), the novellas Taratuta and Naturaleza muerta con cachimba (Still Life with Pipe) and Donde van a morir los elefantes (1995). El mocho (1997) and Lagartija sin cola (The Lizard's Tale) were published posthumously. Death Jos√© Donoso died of liver cancer in his house in Santiago, 7 December 1996 at the age of 72. On his deathbed, according to popular belief, he asked that they read him the poems of Altazor of Vicente Huidobro. His remains were buried in the cemetery of a spa located in the province of Petorca, 80 kilometers from Valpara√≠so. In 2009, his daughter, Pilar Donoso, published a biography of her father titled Correr el tupido velo (Drawing the Veil), based on her father's private diaries, notes and letters, as well as Pilar's own memories.

She was born at Aspatria, Cumberland in 1931 and although she lived in London for the greater part of her life, she devoted her career to painting and drawing places close to her place of birth. The Cumberland landscape would always remain her chief influence, inspiration and theme. Biography=Early beginnings Sheila Fell was born into a poor household at Aspatria in 1931, the only child of John (Jack) and Anne Fell. Her father was a coalminer who worked at the Brayton Domain Colliery about a mile and a half from Aspatria. Her mother was a seamstress.Goldman, R. (ed) 2012. Breakthrough: Autobiographical Accounts of the Education of Some Socially Disadvantaged Children, Vol. 212. Abingdon: Routledge Library Editions. . Chapter IV: \\"Sheila Fell\\", p. 57-72. By 1936 her father was out of work, but later found work in Whitehaven. Whilst working at another pit in Siddick, some time later, he had both legs crushed in a roof fall. After his convalescence, he returned to work for a year, but then gave up work altogether. At the age of six Fell contracted diphtheria, but her mother refused to have her admitted to hospital, instead caring for her at home. Education After her early education at Richmond Hill School, Aspatria, Fell gained a scholarship allowing her to attend the Nelson Thomlinson School in Wigton, where the teacher responsible for art, Mrs Campbell-Taylor, recognised her ability and encouraged her to go to art college. At the age of 16 she enrolled at the Carlisle School of Art (1947‚Äì1949), then housed in Tullie House. She later described this experience as a 'dismal disaster'. She explained: ‚ÄúThey said I would never make a painter and should do textile design.‚Äù After rejecting their advice she enrolled at Saint Martin's School of Art (1949‚Äì1951) where she studied under Roland Vivian Pitchforth and John Napper. She gained her National Diploma in Design at the age of 21, and then stayed on for a further twelve months to complete a post graduate course. Fell augmented the grant received from Cumberland County Council by working in a night club and also at the National Gallery. During her college years she exhibited her work in the Young Contemporaries Show in 1952 and 1953. After leaving college, she worked for a while as a freelance painter during the day, did head modelling, and worked in a caf√© at night. In 1955 at the age of 24, she held her first exhibition, becoming the youngest ever artist to exhibit at the Beaux Arts Gallery in Bond Street, London.West Cumberland Times 6 August 1955 In December 1955, she appeared on the ten-minute 'Highlight' television programme, which spotlighted the personalities of the day.West Cumberland Times 3 December 1955 She joined the teaching staff of Chelsea School of Art in 1958. She would never return to live in Cumberland but its landscape dominated her work for the rest of her life, Personal life Not only did her first exhibition in London completely sell out but it brought her to the attention of artist L. S. Lowry, who bought two paintings and a drawing, bringing a friendship that would last for many years. Lowry gave her all the help he could, he advised, encouraged, sympathised, and above all bought her pictures, some twenty of them in total, many later donated to international galleries. He made her a weekly allowance of ¬£3 and would often visit her when she returned home to Aspatria for her regular holidays. They would go out to the countryside to paint. Lowry got on well with her parents and always called her \\"Miss Fell\\", until shortly before his death. Success never changed her; she had few pretensions of grandeur, as observed by the photographer Lord Kilbracken, who wrote in The Tatler: ‚ÄúShe still smokes Woodbines, is still as likely to eat in a workingman's caf√© and still spends less on clothes than the average typist.‚Äù.Cumbrian Life, February/March 1991, page 63 Although never married, she had a daughter Anna in 1958, by the Greek sculptor Takis Vassilakis. Style and influences Sheila Fell never painted romantic pictures of nature or pretty chocolate box pictures of sunny days among the lakes and fells of her native countryside, but used powerful, melancholy oils of living landscape, presided over by huge brooding mountains and dark looming clouds. Colour was always less important than tone, she painted the hills and the seas of the area she loved so well, she painted the earth and those who worked it, depicting rich brown soils, piles of potatoes, small groups of driven cattle, indistinguishable farm buildings and terraced houses running along the streets of Aspatria.Cumbrian Life February/March 1991, page 62 Several major artists influenced her style, C√©zanne, Constant Permeke, Auerbach and Van Gogh are all evident in parts of her early work. Death Sheila Fell Memorial at Aspatria In December 1979, Hunter Davies began his article for the Sunday Times: ‚ÄúSheila Fell lives at the top of a long flight of stairs in Chelsea.‚Äù He ended it with Fell's own words. ‚ÄúI don't think of myself as a woman artist. Artists are either good or bad. I also intend to live until 104. I've promised myself I will. It's what keeps me going when I worry if I'll ever have time to do all the paintings in my head.‚ÄùSunday Times 16 December 1979 However, by the time the article appeared she was already dead. The inquest into her death reported that she had died of alcohol poisoning, on 15 December, at her London flat. She was 48 years of age. Awards Fell's first major award came in October 1957 after she entered a painting in the John Moores painting exhibition at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. The competition drew 3,000 entries, short listed to 250. Fell, the only female winner, came second in the junior section and picked up a cheque for ¬£250.West Cumberland Times 19 October 1957 In 1959, she received a 'Boise' travelling scholarship. Although she travelled extensively throughout Italy, Greece, Switzerland and France the period was not a success. As she told one enquirer: ‚ÄúI have an obsession about Cumberland. I have tried painting in other parts of the world, particularly Greece, but it just doesn't work.‚ÄùWest Cumberland Times 26 March 1960 In 1967, she was awarded an Arts Council Purchase Award. In 1969 she was elected Associate Member of the Royal Academy (A.R.A.) and a full membership (R.A.) five years later.

Her battle was shown in Freeheld (2007), the winner of the Academy Award for Best Short Documentary, and the feature film of the same name (2015), in which Hester is portrayed by Julianne Moore. Early life She was born in Elgin, Illinois, and grew up in Florham Park, the daughter of Diana (1922‚Äì1995) and George Hester (1919‚Äì1992). She has two brothers, George II and James, and a sister, real-estate agent Lynda (Hester) D'Orio. Hester realized she was gay at a young age. Though she accepted herself, at times her sexual orientation made her feel isolated. As a child her family often summered at the Jersey Shore, and later Hester would return to work in the area.Laurel Hester obituary accessed March 22, 2015 Education She earned a bachelor's degree in criminal justice and psychology from Stockton State College, now Stockton University. While in school, she was a charter member and co-coordinator of the student club, Gay People's Alliance, the first LGBT group on Stockton's campus. Along with Kevin M. Cathcart, Hester served as co-president, but used a pseudonym so no one outside of the group would know she was gay. Her role in this student group was made public in November 1975, in a letter to the editor of The Argo entitled, Gay's rebuttal, which later resulted in her loss of a police department internship. She would continue to write articles advocating LGBT rights for The Argo until her graduation in 1977.http://stocktonargo.com/ Career Her first position in law enforcement was in North Wildwood, New Jersey. After two summers working as a seasonal officer, she was told she would not be hired for a third because she was gay. She was then hired in Ocean County, New Jersey as a police officer. Hester spent 23 years there, becoming a detective in the Ocean County prosecutor's office, where she worked on a variety of cases. She was one of the first women to achieve the rank of lieutenant in her department and was greatly respected by her fellow officers. Relationship In 1999, Hester met Stacie Andree at a volleyball game in Philadelphia. Hester was 19 years older than Andree, and the two women soon fell in love. They ended up buying a house together in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, and registered their domestic partnership on October 28, 2004.Stacie Andree public record Retrieved July 22, 2015 At the time, same-sex marriage was not legal in the United States. Illness and Death Hester was a Detective in the Ocean County prosecutor's office when she was diagnosed with rapidly spreading lung cancer. She died on February 18, 2006, aged 49, in the home she shared with her partner, Stacie Andree.Wilson, Michael. \\"Lieutenant Who Won Pension Rights for Her Domestic Partner Dies at 49\\", The New York Times, February 20, 2006. Accessed December 18, 2007. \\"Lieutenant Hester died in the house in Point Pleasant that she owned with her partner, Stacie Andree.\\" Freeheld Laurel Hester's cancer metastasized, spread to her brain, and it became clear that she had little time to live. Hester lived with and jointly owned a house with her registered domestic partner, Stacie Andree, who would not be able to afford mortgage payments upon Hester's death. A married heterosexual with Hester's years of police service would be able to pass on pension benefits to a spouse, but this privilege was not afforded to same-sex domestic partners in Ocean County. Hester appealed to local authorities to change this policy, and was supported by the local Policemen's Benefit Association. Instead, in a private meeting on November 9, 2005, the five Republican members of the county board of chosen freeholders voted against the proposal, with freeholder John P. Kelly arguing that it threatened \\"the sanctity of marriage.\\" On November 23, a rally of between 100 and 200 supporters gathered to protest the county's inaction. On January 18, 2006, an impassioned videotaped appeal by a weakening Hester from her hospital bed was shown at a meeting of the freeholders, who then met with county Republican leaders in a teleconference on January 20. The next day, the freeholders announced that they were reversing their stance, and would meet on January 25 to extend pension benefits to registered domestic partners, three weeks before Hester's death. Tributes Hester's battle for pension benefits was shown in Freeheld (2007), the winner of the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) and the feature film Freeheld (2015), in which Hester is portrayed by Julianne Moore. The LEAGUE Foundation, which provides financial resources for American LGBT high school seniors entering their first year of institutions of higher learning, has awarded the Laurel Hester Memorial Scholarship annually since 2006. The Gay Officers Action League (GOAL) of New York awards the Laurel Hester Award. In February 2016, Stockton University's Board of Trustees presented the original GPU charter (of which Hester co-founded) to its renamed student club, Pride Alliance. This framed historical document now hangs in the Women's, Gender & Sexuality Center at Stockton University for all to visit.

It comes from an iron-rich red earth, or bole, found in Armenia. Armenian bole, also known as bolus armenus or bole armoniac, is an earthy clay, usually red, native to Armenia but also found in other places. The term Armenian was later referred to a specific quality of the clay. Originally used in medication, it has also been used as a pigment, as a poliment or base for gilding, and for other uses. It is red due to the presence of iron oxide; the clay also contains hydrous silicates of aluminum and possibly magnesium. Uses Historically, the term bolu or bolus was used only for medicinal earths and Armenian bole was used as an astringent, prescribed against diarrhea, dysentery, and bleeding. References to Armenian bole were made by Theophrastus, Dioscorides (c. 41‚Äì90 AD) and Pliny the Elder (23‚Äì79 AD). Externally, it was used in strengthening plasters, against dislocations of the joints. Physicians sometimes also called it Rubrica Synopica, from the city of Synope, where it is supposed to be found. Use for internal medicine may have side effects as the minerals often include heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, lead and zinc that can cause toxicity. In the nineteenth century, it was incorporated into non-soluble tooth powder. These types of powders would get stuck between the gums and the teeth and leave an unsightly discoloration. As a result, they were coloured red using Armenian bole to disguise the buildup around the teeth. It is also used in bookbinding for coloring, or applied to the edges during gilding, as a base for the gold leaf and to give the binding a greater depth and luster. In pottery, it is used as a red pigment for the ƒ∞znik pottery of Turkey. Finally, it has also been used in the waterproofing of windmill sails. A popular mixture was: 10 liters of water, combined with 0.75 liter linseed oil, 0.75 liter grease, and 1 kg of bolus.Werken met molens by Werkgroep West-Vlaamse Molens v.z.w.Bolus used for windmill sail See also *Levant bole, a similar clay, often used in place of Armenian bole References Category:Natural materials Category:Medicinal clay ","title":"Armenian bole"},{"id":"3813657","text":"Sono, SONO, or SoNo may refer to: Places * SoNo, Atlanta, a district in the city of Atlanta, Georgia * Sono Department, a department in Burkina Faso * South Norwalk or \\"SoNo\\", a neighborhood in Norwalk, Connecticut :* SoNo Collection, a mall in South Norwalk. * Sono, Jamui, a village in the Indian state of Bihar * SoNo Collection, an upscale shopping mall in Norwalk, Connecticut  People with the surname  *, Japanese writer * Sion Sono, Japanese filmmaker Music groups * SONO (vocal group), an a cappella music group from Denmark * Sono (band), a band from Germany Other uses *Sono arsenic filter, a water filter *Sono Motors, a German electric carmaker, behind the Sion (electric car) Category:Japanese-language surnames ","title":"Sono"},{"id":"3813676","text":"Cynthia Harriss is an American retail and tourism industry executive, notable for her senior roles with Gap Inc. and The Walt Disney Company.
