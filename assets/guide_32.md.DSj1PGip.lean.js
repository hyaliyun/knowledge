Utian is a physician, reproductive endocrinologist, clinical researcher, and academic women's health department administrator. He is best known for first recognizing menopause as a potential health-related issue. He is the co-founder of the International Menopause Society and founder of the North American Menopause Society. Previously he has worked as a medical department administrator at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, the University Hospitals of Cleveland, and academic chairman of the department of Reproductive Biology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. He is currently the Arthur H. Bill Professor Emeritus of Reproductive Biology at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, a consultant in women's health, and Scientific Director of Rapid Medical Research Inc. Education Utian received an MD from the University of the Witwatersrand and a PhD from the University of Cape Town. He also received a DSc degree in medicine in 2007, becoming only the eleventh recipient of the degree in 100 years. Career in South Africa Utian is credited for describing menopause as a potential health-related issue in 1967. He has described the situation that led to his discovery as occurring when he was invited to visit a large pharmaceutical firm in West Berlin. He has stated that \\"A new female hormone was mentioned and thereby started my interest in the subject. Upon me return [home] I approached the Chairman of the Department of Gynaecology of the University of Cape Town ... and spelled out my plans for a menopause clinic.\\" This clinic, named the Femininity Clinic (later renamed the Mature Woman Clinic), was the first of its kind in the world, located at the Groote Schuur Hospital. In 1976 he also became one of the three co-founders of the International Menopause Society. Utian ultimately left South Africa due to conflicts with the Apartheid government, including his objections to the treatment of non-white physicians in the country's hospitals. Career in Cleveland Utian ran the South African clinic until his move to Cleveland Ohio in 1976, where he began to work for the Mount Sinai Medical Center. There he eventually served as Director of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. In 1982 he began performing In vitro fertilisations, becoming one of the first medical doctors in the US to do so. In 1985 he became the first physician to successfully complete the in vitro fertilization of a surrogate mother without using an egg from the surrogate mother. Utian's team instead removed eggs from the ovaries of a woman whose uterus had been removed, fertilized them with her husband's sperm, and implanted the fertilized eggs into the womb of a surrogate mother. Utian reported the event to the New England Journal of Medicine in a published letter announcing it as the world's first successful effort of this kind. All previous surrogate pregnancies had used an egg from the surrogate mother instead of the woman unable to have children. The baby was also the world's first baby where a court in Michigan determined that the genetic mother and not the birth mother was the one who should be listed on the birth certificate (the first baby in the world where the women who gave birth was not recognized as the mother). The story was featured on the cover of Life magazine and on Nova. Utian became the Director of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University Hospitals of Cleveland and Chairman of Reproductive Biology at Case Western Reserve University in 1989, staying in the position until 1999. In 1989 Utian also became the Executive director and founder of the North American Menopause Society, located in Cleveland, Ohio. He also served as the editor of the society's scientific journal Menopause. He has additionally served as the President of the International Menopause Society. In 1998 he became the founding Secretary of the Council of Affiliated Menopause Societies. Utian retired from the head of the North American Menopause Society in 2009. Utian left academic department administration after twenty years service to continue as a medical practitioner at the Cleveland Clinic, and clinical research scientist at Rapid Medical Research, which he founded in 1997. He also served as a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Case Western Reserve University, where he is now Arthur H. Bill Professor Emeritus of Reproductive Biology. Utian served as the Medical Editor of Maturitas from 1983-1993, was named Honorary Founding Editor of Menopause (1994-2010), and served as Editor of Menopause Management between 1987 and 2009. Views on menopause In 1976 Utian co-determined the first internationally accepted definitions of menopause and time-related events. In 1985 Utian publicly disagreed with the medical definition of menopause agreed upon by the International Menopause Society. He believed menopause to be a potential endocrinopathy (disease of the endocrine system), with potential adverse physical effects on pelvic and extra-pelvic organs such as bone, cardiovascular system, brain, skin and sensory organs. He has written that menopause has been recognized by society as a stage of life as far back as Biblical times. Utian has stated that the symptoms women experience when their ovaries shut down are due to an evolutionary lag, as the endocrine system of the human female has not kept pace with the increase in life expectancy human beings have experienced recently. Utian is known as the world's most prolific author of studies in the field of menopause,Greer, 14. including 26 authored or co-authored articles during the first ten years of the field's existence and more than 200 over his career.Greer, 16.

According to Engels, the seed for this book was planted 40 years before, in The German Ideology written by Marx and Engels, but unpublished in their lifetime. The undertaking is performed to deal critically with German philosophy from a dialectical materialist position. Here Engels emphasized the importance of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Ludwig Feuerbach for their own theories. Hegel's idealist, conservative system must be distinguished from his materialist, revolutionary method of dialectics. Feuerbach had turned to law against Hegel's idealistic system and \\"the fundamental question of philosophy\\": the relation of thinking and being. But Feuerbach rejected Hegel's dialectical method, which is why his view of man and nature remained abstract and unhistorical. Marx only kept the \\"rational\\" content from the dialectical method and freed it from their idealistic form.  Publication history  The book was only about 50 pages long, and was written early in 1886, and published that year in \\"Die Neue Zeit\\", issues No. 4 and 5. In 1888 a revised print by Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Dietz was published in Stuttgart, which contained some additional commentary by Engels. In this edition, Marx' 1845 Theses on Feuerbach was also reprinted for the first time. The first English translation by Austin Lewis was published in the United States in 1903 by Charles H. Kerr & Company.

(\\"It's that time again!\\"), also known as Waldolala, is a Dutch television show from 1978, written and directed by Wim T. Schippers and co-produced by Schippers, Gied Jaspars, Wim van der Linden en Ellen Jens. It was the last TV show written for Dolf Brouwers, who had played the character Sjef van Oekel in previous shows (De Fred Hachéshow, Barend is weer bezig, and Van Oekel's Discohoek). The show ran for ten episodes, and featured Brouwers as Waldo van Dungen, formerly a waiter at the night club Waldolala, who had acquired the club after a rich woman (Gé Braadslee, played by Mimi Kok) fell in love with him and bought the place for him. The show featured other characters from the previous shows Schippers had done for the VPRO, and shared many other characteristics—nudity, vulgarity, linguistic games (including many double entendres). The plot line and individual scenes were typically chaotic; in the end, van Dungen dies and it is revealed that the entire series of events was a kind of flashback told by van Dungen's psychiatrist. The show's alternate name, Waldolala, was explained by Waldo van Dungen as a combination between his first name and the phrase \\"Oh-la-la\\". It was also part of the title of the theme song, a \\"megahit\\" for the girls group Luv', a group formed by producer Hans van Hemert, who had been commissioned to write the show's theme song. Luv' had had two modestly successful singles with ABBA-esque songs, but van Hemert wanted to try a different style of music; Schippers and Jaspars pushed him, and van Hemert agreed to have Luv' sing the tune. They performed \\"U.O.Me (Theme from Waldolala)\\" on the show, and the song became a hit—in hindsight, van Hemert credited the VPRO with the band's commercial success. The show was released on DVD in 2008 as the fifth volume in the series Wim T. Schippers' Televisiepraktijken - sinds 1962; the DVD includes a clip from the NOS Journaal, 24 September 1979, on the death of Dolf Brouwers, and \\"Flagula\\" (1966), one of the Sad Movies Schippers and Van der Linden made in the 1960s.

The Karen were encouraged to settle in the Andaman islands in 1924 by Dr Marshall, the principal of the Karen Baptist Theological Seminary, following a visit to his cousin, who was the commissioner there. In 1925, the first thirteen families arrived, led by a priest, Reverend Luygi. In 1926, another fifty families arrived and the first Karen village, Webi, was founded on the Middle Andaman Island. They worked as foresters, for which purpose the British government had moved them to the Islands with the help of the missionaries, and the population of the village was about 500 people in 2009. In 2004, the total population of Karen in the Andamans was about 2000 people, living in eight villages in the Mayabunder tehsil of the North and Middle Andaman district: Borang, Chipon, Deopur, Lataw, Karmatang 9 and 10, Lucknow (Burmadera) and Webi. A government declaration was made on 12 December 2005, reserving some government jobs and places in higher education for the Karen as one of the Other Backward Classes in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Karen respect the natural forest in a spiritual way and so avoid defiling it by spitting or urinating. Their harvesting of its resources for their community is sensitive to the need for sustainability and so they avoid killing female animals in their hunting. They use a variety of forest plants for construction, food and medicine. For example, they make canoes from the trunks of mulberry trees (artocarpus chaplasha Roxb.) and use a paste of the sweet flag laniti with other aromatic plants as a poultice for colds and headaches.

Life and career Paddy O'Brien was born in Castlebarnagh, a small townsland outside of Daingean, County Offaly, in the Midlands of Ireland. He is the son of Christopher and Molly O'Brien, who had a small farm in Castlebarnagh. He attended National School in Daingean, and Tullamore Vocational School, and then became an apprentice for Bord na Mona at Boora, where he worked from 1961 to 1969. From an early age, he was interested in traditional music, and played in competitions and on television for RTE. In 1969, O'Brien moved to Dublin and became involved in the Irish traditional music scene there. Paddy O’Brien is a collector of Irish traditional music; in a musical career that spans more than sixty years, he has collected more than 3,000 compositions—jigs, reels, hornpipes, airs, and marches, including many rare and unusual tunes. He was named Oireachtas champion four times, and All- Ireland senior accordion champion in 1975. In Ireland, he played and recorded with the Castle Ceili Band and Ceoltoiri Laighean. In 1978, Paddy O'Brien began recording and playing in the United States, in Washington D.C., Saint Louis, Saint Paul, San Francisco, Boston, and New York. He has been featured on six recordings with Shanachie Records since 1978, and in 1988 released his first solo album, \\"Stranger at the Gate,\\" on the Green Linnet label. His second solo recording, \\"Mixing the Punch,\\" was released by New Folk Records in 2011, and his work has been included on live recordings and compilations of Irish traditional music. O'Brien has taught at the Swannanoa Gathering, the Goderich Celtic Week, and the Catskills Irish Arts Week, and at the Willie Clancy Summer School held in Milltown Malbay, County Clare, and has served several times as a master artist in the Minnesota State Arts Board Folk Arts Apprenticeship Program. He has played and toured with other Irish traditional musicians, including James Kelly, Martin Hayes, Susan McKeown, Tommy Peoples, Peter Ostroushko, Patrick Ourceau, and others at concerts and festivals in North America, Ireland, and Europe. In 2007 he was invited to play Irish traditional music for audiences in Moscow. In 1994, O'Brien embarked on an Irish traditional music project, to record and assemble background information on 500 jigs and reels from his repertoire of traditional melodies. The result was Volume One of The Paddy OBrien Tune Collection: A Personal Treasury of Irish Traditional Music. In 2011, he released The Paddy O'Brien Tune Collection, Volume Two, featuring another 500 tunes, including jigs, reels, hornpipes, slip jigs, and polkas. A third volume of the Paddy O'Brien Tune Collection, Volune Three. containing another 500 tunes, was released in 2013. O'Brien currently tours nationally and internationally as a solo musician and with his trio Chulrua, and also plays dances and concerts around the American midwest with his seven-piece Irish traditional music group, O'Rourke's Feast. He lives in Saint Paul, Minnesota with his wife, crime novelist Erin Hart. =Discography= *Castle Céilí Band / Irish Pub Music / Arfolk SB 314 (1970) *Castle Céilí Band / Castle Céilí Band / Comhaltas Ceoltoiri Éireann (1971) *Ceoltoiri Laighean / The Crooked Road / Gael-Linn CEF 035 (1973) *Ceoltoiri Laighean / The Star of Munster / Gael-Linn CEF 047 (1975) *James Kelly, Paddy O'Brien,and Dáithí Sproule / Is It Yourself? / Shanachie 29015 (1978) *James Kelly, Paddy O'Brien,and Dáithí Sproule / Spring in the Air / Shanachie 29018 (1982) *Hill 16 / Hill 16 / Meadowlark101 (1984) *Paddy O'Brien, Dáithí Sproule, Karen Andersen, Erin Hart / Stranger at the Gate / Green Linnet GLCD 1091 (1988) *Irish accordion anthology / The Big Squeeze / Green Linnet 9014 (1988) *Seán O'Driscoll / Up the Airy Mountain (guest) Green Linnet (1988) *Peter Ostroushko / Blue Mesa (guest)/ Red House Records RHR30(1989) *Paddy O'Brien Paddy O'Brien Tune Collection, Volume One (1995) * James Kelly, Paddy O'Brien, Dáithí Sproule / Traditional Music of Ireland / Shanachie 34014 (1995, re-release) *Irish music anthology / Hunger No More / Eire Arts, MN Food Share (1997) *Live concert recording / Gaelic Roots Festival 1995 / Boston College, Kells 9514 (1997) *Chulrua / Barefoot on the Altar / Pied Piper Productions PPP 301 (2000) *Irish music anthology / The Ice Palace / Irish Music & Dance Association (2001) *Chulrua / Down the Back Lane / Shanachie 22001 (2003) *Paddy O'Brien, Jamie Gans,and Dáithí Sproule / Snug in the Blanket / Black Tea Tunes BTT012 (2004) *Accordion anthology / Minnesota All Stars / Rounder 82161-6110-2 (2005) *The Doon Céilí Band / Around the World for Sport / Shanachie 23001 (2006) *Chulrua / The Singing Kettle / Shanachie 23002 (2007) *Paddy O'Brien, Dáithí Sproule, Karen Andersen, Erin Hart / Stranger at the Gate / Green Linnet GLI 1091 (re-release by Compass Records, 2008) *Live concert recording / Young Irish Musicians Weekend / Center for Irish Music (2008) *Irish music anthology / Hooley in the Heartland / Irish Music & Dance Association (2009) *Paddy O'Brien, Tom Schaefer,Paul Wehling, Erin Hart / The Sailor's Cravat / New Folk Records WCM001 (2011) *Paddy O'Brien / Paddy O'Brien Tune Collection, Volume Two (2011) *Paddy O'Brien, Theresa Baker / Mixing the Punch / New Folk Records WCM003 (2011) *Paddy O'Brien / Paddy O'Brien Tune Collection, Volume Three (2013) =Awards= *1969 Oireachtas / First place Solo Accordion, First place Céilí Band (Castle Ceili Band) *1970 Oireachtas / First Place Solo Accordion *1973 Oireachtas / First Place Solo Accordion *1975 Fleadh Cheoil (All-Ireland) / First Place Senior AccordionList of All-Ireland Fleadh champions *1975 Fleadh Cheoil (All-Ireland) / First place Trio with fiddler Joe Ryan and flute player Micheál Ó hAlmhainList of All-Ireland Fleadh champions *1977 Oireachtas / First place Solo Accordion, First place Duet with Joe Ryan *1989 Minnesota State Arts Board / Master Artist—Folk Arts Apprenticeship *1993 Minnesota State Arts Board / Master Artist—Folk Arts Apprenticeship *1994 National Endowment for the Arts / Folk Arts Project Grant (To Minnesota Folklife Society) *1996 Minnesota State Arts Board / Master Artist—Folk Arts Apprenticeship *1998 Minnesota State Arts Board / Master Artist—Folk Arts Apprenticeship *2006 Minnesota Irish Fair / Legacy Fund Grant *2008 Minnesota State Arts Board / Artist Initiative Grant *2009 Bush Foundation, Saint Paul MN / Bush Artist Fellowship *2010 Irish Music & Dance Association / IMDA Honors Lifetime Achievement *2012 TG4 Gradam Ceoil (Irish Traditional Music Awards)/ Cumadóir – Composer of the Year *2013 Minnesota State Arts Board / Folk and Traditional Arts Grant =Publications= * Dal gCais, Journal of Clare (Vol. 11, 1993) Poems about Willie Clancy and Seamus Ennis * Paddy O'Brien Tune Collection: Volume One (1995) Library of Congress Card Catalog Number 95-92420 * Paddy O'Brien Tune Collection: Volume Two (2011) Library of Congress Card Catalog Number 95-92420 * The Road from Castlebarnagh: Growing Up In Irish Music, Orpen Press, Dublin (2012) References Category:1945 births Category:Irish musicians Category:Irish accordionists Category:Living people Category:People from County Offaly Category:Musicians from Saint Paul, Minnesota Category:Irish writers Category:Writers from Saint Paul, Minnesota Category:21st-century accordionists Category:Green Linnet Records artists Category:Shanachie Records artists ","title":"Paddy O'Brien (musician and author)"},{"id":"40301957","title":"Mohammed Abukhousa"},{"id":"40301971","text":"Qeshlaq-e Bakhtiar () may refer to: * Qeshlaq-e Bakhtiar, Ardabil * Qeshlaq-e Bakhtiar, West Azerbaijan ","title":"Qeshlaq-e Bakhtiar"},{"id":"40302062","text":"Muirgel was an Irish woman who helped her country get rid of a powerful enemy. She killed one of their chieftains in 882 AD. Muirgel was born to an important leader in Ulster, Maelechlainn. According to the Chronicum Scotorum, she slayed the son of Ausli with the help of Otir, son of Eirgni. The son of Ausli was an important chieftain of the long time enemy Vikings. Later historians recalled this act and similar ones as a display by woman of \\"loyalty of kith, kin and country.” Though the majority of sources point to Muirgel's story as unfolding with the slaying of the foreign chieftain, a few sources point to a slightly different version of her life. It is reported that Muirgel may have married Iarnkne in order to create an alliance amongst the two peoples. This version of her story is further expanded on in The Mystery of the Angels and Bloody Sunday: The Story of the 1920 Irish Rebellion, both fiction novels by Joseph Murphy.

Schippers, Ruud van Hemert, Gied Jaspars, and Wim van der Linden. Biography Born in Utrecht in 1912, Brouwers grew up in The Hague and held various jobs including hairdresser, travel guide, and vacuum cleaner salesman. He loved operetta and tried without success for a career as a singer, having only one minor hit. In 1972 he was discovered when he auditioned as an extra for the Wim T. Schippers television show De Fred Hachéshow (he was friends with the show's lead actor, Harry Touw), and quickly rose to prominence. Schippers created the character Sjef van Oekel for Brouwers, who returned in two later Schippers shows, Barend is weer bezig (1972–1973) and Van Oekel's Discohoek (1974). The van Oekel character was ancillary in De Fred Hachéshow and Barend is weer bezig, both of which had Barend Servet as the lead, but central in Van Oekel's Discohoek, where he played the host of a music show on television that parodied popular music programs of the era. In Het is weer zo laat! (1974) Brouwers, who was 67 at the time, plays Waldo van Dungen, a bumbling and chaotic nightclub owner. Formerly a waiter at the club, van Dungen had married a rich admirer, Gé Braadslee, who buys it for him; he renames it Waldolala. As van Oekel and van Dungen, Brouwers was a striking character with a large television presence, and equipped with large glasses, a tuxedo, and a \\"Hitler mustache\\". His sense of humor corresponded with Schippers'; both were extraordinarily fond of and gifted in creating puns and using unorthodox and humorous syntax and diction. Brouwers recorded many Schippers-penned and other songs, most of which comic and dramatic. With Manke Nelis he recorded \\"Vis wordt duur betaald\\" (#46 in the Dutch charts in 1988), but his best known song is probably \\"Vette jus\\" (\\"[Sauerkraut with] greasy gravy\\"), a dish still associated with him in a song that is little more than a list of Dutch dishes. The song was first performed on the 1974 Christmas special for Barend is weer bezig; it was written by Schippers, Gied Jaspars, and Clous van Mechelen.* Whether van Oekel was just used or also abused by Schippers and others was the topic of a 2004 theater production. According to Hein Janssen, writing in de Volkskrant, it is certainly true that Brouwers jumped at the opportunity to become a celebrity, but the extent to which Schippers and the other writers and directors pushed Brouwers (he balked, for instance, at having to simulate sex with an inflatable doll) is questionable.

Sjef van Oekel was a popular TV comedy character created by Dutch artist Wim T. Schippers and played by Dutch comedian, singer and actor Dolf Brouwers (1912–1997). Van Oekel started as a side character in De Fred Hachéshow in 1972, but became such a cult figure that he gained his own television show, Van Oekel's Discohoek, songs and even a comic strip, all written by Schippers.http://www.beeldengeluidwiki.nl/index.php/Dolf_Brouwers Character Wim T. Schippers created Sjef van Oekel in 1972 as a Belgian french fries salesman from the village Reet. Schippers had never visited Reet, but had seen the name on a company manufacturing car accessories and enjoyed the double entendre of the name (\\"Reet\\" means \\"crack\\" or \\"buttcrack\\" in Dutch).http://www.beeldengeluidwiki.nl/index.php/Dolf_Brouwers In line with his character's origin Van Oekel originally used a Flemish accent, but quickly dropped this in favor for his own Dutch accent. Van Oekel is typically dressed in a fine black tuxedo and always talks and behaves in a refined manner, complete with archaisms. However something always went wrong during his presentations, either on the set or he himself tripped or went nauseous. Situations like these always lead to his well-known catch phrase: \\"Ik word niet goed!\\" (\\"I'm starting to feel not well!\\"). Whenever Van Oekel said this he usually used a handkerchief to clean off the sweat on his forehead. In one controversial episode he threw up in the bicycle bag of his sidekick Evert van de Pik (played by Jaap Bar), which outraged Dutch journalist Henk van der Meyden so much that he started an unsuccessful campaign to get the program banned. Other well-known catch phrases of Van Oekel were \\"Als het ware...\\" (\\"As it were...\\") and \\"Pardon...reeds\\" (\\"Pardon... already\\"). History The character made his debut in 1972, in De Fred Hachéshow, a controversial television show created by Wim T. Schippers. He later returned in two later Schippers shows, Barend is weer bezig (1972–1973) and Van Oekel's Discohoek (1974). The van Oekel character was ancillary in De Fred Hachéshow and Barend is weer bezig, both of which had Barend Servet as the lead, but central in Van Oekel's Discohoek, where he played the host of a music show on television that parodied popular music programs of the era. Van Oekel quickly became a cult figure with viewers. Brouwers recorded many Schippers-penned and other songs, most of which comic and dramatic. With Manke Nelis he recorded \\"Vis wordt duur betaald\\" (#46 in the Dutch charts in 1988), but his best known song is probably \\"Vette jus\\" (\\"[Sauerkraut with] greasy gravy\\"), a dish still associated with him in a song that is little more than a list of Dutch dishes. The song was first performed on the 1973 Christmas special for Barend is weer bezig; it was written by Schippers, Gied Jaspars, and Clous van Mechelen.* Comic strip In 1976 Wim T. Schippers and Theo van den Boogaard drew a celebrity comic strip series based on the character. Many stories and gags feature Van Oekel embarrassing other people or meeting rather eccentric and exhibitionistic people himself. Sjef van Oekel quickly became notorious for featuring very risqué subject matter, including religion, pornography, pedophilia, prostitution, vulgar language, and so on. The stories were published in De Nieuwe Revu and sold well enough to be translated in French (\\"Léon Van Oukel\\", later \\"Léon La Terreur\\"), German (\\"Julius Patzenhofer\\", later \\"Leo, der Terrorist\\"), Danish and Spanish.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/boogaard.htm Brouwers' personal backlash Van Oekel made a few media appearances in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but by 1984 this came to a halt too. Brouwers felt increasingly exploited by Schippers, especially regarding the comic strip. In 1989 he dragged Schippers and Van den Boogaard to court because the comic strip frequently portrayed him in vulgar situations without him earning a penny from it. The judge ruled in favor of Brouwers and decided that the series could continue, but the character was no longer allowed to be portrayed in \\"obscene or pornographic situations\\". A financial settlement was also agreed on.http://www.beeldengeluidwiki.nl/index.php/Dolf_Brouwershttps://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/boogaard.htm Whether van Oekel was just used or also abused by Schippers and others was the topic of a 2004 theater production.

History The old part of the building was built for Emil Hjort (1843–1924) as a new home for his trading house, S. Seidelin, which had outgrown its premises on Amagertorv. The new building wasdesigned by Valdemar Ingemann and Bernhard Ingemann (1869–1923) while P. Gram was responsible for its construction. The building was acquired by Pressens Fællesindkøb. In 1973, needing more space, they acquired the neighbouring building, a house from 1730. It was demolished and replaced by a modern infill built from 1974 to 1976 to a design by . A number of artifacts were in connection with the work retrieved from the site, in an old well which had been covered in 1868, including porcelain from the East Indies, glass with Frederick V's coat of arms, long Dutch clay pibes and a pocket watch in a case of turtle shell. In June 2007, Danske Mediers Arbejdsgiverforening acquired the building for DKK 87 million. In November 2018, it was sold to a property company owned by the founders of Rekom. Architecture The modern infill is built in a narrow site of just eight metres width. The building fills the entire lot, thereby raising the courtyard space to its rear. It is a concrete structure covered with a glazed curtain wall which is slanted on the rear side. The dark-painted steel frames of the glass panels are asymmetrically placed, creating a composition remniscient of Piet Mondrian's paintings. The modern extension was listed in 1992. It was described as a fine example of the integration of contemporary architecture in a historical neighbourhood, an excellent example of Modernist architecture of the 1970s with fine detailing showcasing craftsmanship of high quality.

Previous companies  Perlman went on to “launch five successful startups before he turned 30.” On its list of the world’s top 35 innovators under 35, the MIT Technology Review cites Perlman’s former project GreatPoint Energy as well as other disruptive technology ventures in important areas: “cheaper desalination plants, anti-obesity medicines, drugs that fight diseases of old age, and [processes for converting garbage into biofuel and generating electricity from geothermal energy].” To date, Perlman has helped launch the following companies: # Cignal Global Communications – A pioneer in integrated voice/data communications technology; acquired by United Pan-European Communications (NASDAQ: UCOMA). # Coatue Corporation – Developer of high speed flash memory chips; acquired by Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD). # Coskata, Inc. – Commercializing technology to produce low cost liquid fuels and chemicals from natural gas or gasified biomass # Sirtris Pharmaceuticals – Commercializing Sirtuin activating compounds to prevent and treat diseases of old age, such as cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes; taken public and then acquired by GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK). # Zafgen – Developing novel drugs for the treatment of obesity; entering Phase III human trials. Zafgen executed an IPO on the NASDAQ in June 2014 and trades as (NASDAQ: ZFGN) # AltaRock Energy – Developed and commercialized enhanced geothermal technology for 100% renewable power production. # Foro Energy – Commercializing high power lasers for the oil, natural gas, geothermal, and mining industries. # Oasys Water – Provider of advanced seawater desalination and water treatment technology # GreatPoint Energy – Developed a catalyst to convert coal into clean-burning methane gas, using much less water and chemicals than hydrofracking and producing much less pollution than coal combustion power plants # Jetti Resources – Developing technology to extract copper from low-grade primary sulfides. Perlman is on the board of directors for Jetti Resources, which recently appointed mining veteran Chip Goodyear to its board.  GreatPoint Energy  As the former CEO, Perlman was responsible for developing the company's strategy, attracting commercialization partners, fundraising, and the development and execution of capital projects. The company has raised $562 million to date and is backed by leading strategic investors including The Dow Chemical Company, Suncor Energy, AES Corporation, and Peabody Energy, as well as major financial institutions and venture capital firms, including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Khosla Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Advanced Technology Ventures, and Citi’s Sustainable Development Investments.\\"GreatPoint Energy\\" Crunchbase  References   External links  * GreatPoint Energy official site Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:American chairmen of corporations Category:Jewish inventors Category:American technology chief executives Category:American technology company founders Category:Businesspeople from Chicago Category:American chief technology officers ","title":"Andrew Perlman"},{"id":"40302234","text":"Denielsan Martins (born 16 March 1987) is a Cape Verdean sprinter.

Trami also made a fujiwhara interaction with Tropical Depression 13W north of it. The storm also enhanced the southwest monsoon causing more than 20 casualties in the Philippines. Meteorological history During August 16, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started to monitor a tropical depression, that had developed from the outflow of Typhoon Utor, and within a marginal environment for further development about to the southeast of Taipei, Taiwan. During that day the depressions low level circulation centre consolidated as the system moved towards the southeast, before it was named Maring by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration later that day. Early on August 17, as the system moved south-eastwards along the subtropical ridge of high pressure, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)initiated advisories on Maring and designated it as Tropical Depression 12W. Maring began to interact with Tropical Depression 13W north of it and a small high-pressure in the middle of the two storms, exhibiting a Fujiwhara Effect. On August 18, 12W strengthened into a tropical storm, receiving the name of Trami, while steadily tracking generally eastwards. On August 21, at 18:40 UTC, (02:40 CST, August 22), Trami made landfall on China's Fujian province as the JTWC issued their final advisory. Over the next couple of days the system passed through the Chinese provinces of Jiangxi and Hunan as it gradually weakened into a tropical depression. Trami was subsequently last noted by the JMA on August 24, as it dissipated over the autonomous region of Guangxi. Preparations and Impact =Philippines= In the afternoon of August 18, as heavy rains poured down across Luzon, government officials were forced to suspend classes and government work in some cities. PAGASA subsequently issued several rainfall advisories. Major areas in Metro Manila and nearby provinces reported severe flooding.

Units from both MMDA and PNRC also responded to the call and pre- positioned its personnel along critical areas of Metro Manila. Trami killed 18 people in the Philippines and caused intensive flooding all over the nation. The system also intensified floods brought by earlier monsoonal rains in China, wreaking havoc. In the final report by NDRRMC, 32 people were dead, while total damages were amounted to be P1.65 billion (US$37.7 million). =Taiwan and China= During August 20, the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau issued specific warnings for the land and sea.Land warning for Tropical Storm Trami.

On August 21, gale-force winds struck heavily populated areas in northern Taiwan as Trami tracked in a westerly direction. The system brought torrential rainfall to the area, with Taipei receiving 12 inches of rain. A landslide occurred in Hsinchu county and trapped 70 residents. 10 people have been injured in Taiwan and more than 6000 had to evacuate homes. Despite gusty conditions and heavy rainfall, Trami only caused minor damage in Taiwan. Damage across East China amounted to ¥3.43 billion (US$560 million), the majority of which occurred in Fujian Province. At least two people were killed by flooding in Guangxi Province. Trami continued to move west, and made landfall in the Fujian province of China on August 22, 2:40 a.m. local time. Winds peaked at 126 km/h, and immense downpours were recorded over the cities of Fujian, Ningde, Putian and Sanming. 191 counties throughout the province had over 100 mm of rain. Many public services were seriously affected. Hundreds of thousands of residents were evacuated.

He joined the university in the Department of Economics in 1962 after serving in the Delhi School of Economics & the Institute of Economic Growth, Delhi. With his M.A. in Economics from the University of Manchester, Dr Mishra completed his Ph.D. from the London School of Economics and research under the guidance of Nobel laureate Sir William Arthur Lewis. Struggle for freedom Dr Vikas Mishra was born in 1924. With the struggle for freedom on its peak and the country united in its fight for independence, Dr Mishra still studying in school formed a village revolutionary cell to fight for Indian Freedom. A small library was established in the remote village from where he belonged to motivate the youth. Attempts were also made to blow off railway bridges. One instance that Dr Mishra always recounted was the demonstration against the British atrocities in Bettiah. A day before the demonstration many people gathered in Bettiah including Dr Mishra and his friend Kedar Pandey (who went on to become the Railway Minister in Independent India). With these two young bloods in the forefront of the procession Pandit Durga Mishra Ji, their uncle knew that they would be in the line of fire by the British, sensing the danger to the young comrades he locked them both in a house and handed over the keys to one of his trusted lieutenants. Many people died in the police firing and the Bettiah Shaheed (Martyr) Memorial in West Champaran is still a testimony to the incident. Later on he went to jail twice during the freedom struggle. According to Dr Mishra young boys in jail like him were called \\"Gandhi Boys\\" by the British Tommies (policemen). Another memorial for freedom fighters with his name is located at Narkatiaganj Block Office. Alma Mater After India's Independence Dr Mishra, who was studying Law to help Indian freedom fighters, decided not to become a practising lawyer. Teaching and research were to be his future. Without any government funding, he went to England for further studies. Earlier he did his M.Com. and LL.B. from Lucknow University. After teaching for five years, he went to England in 1952 and earned his M.A.(Economics) from the University of Manchester and his PhD from the London School of Economics. Career Dr Mishra worked as a Senior Economist on the team of the Techno-Economic Survey of Bihar undertaken by the NCAER. He was also at the Delhi School of Economics and the Institute of Economic Growth, Delhi before shifting to Kurukshetra University where, later on, he became the Registrar & the youngest Vice-Chancellor. He has proved a worthy student of his worthy teacher Sir William Arthur Lewis, a Nobel Laureate. Professor C. H. Hanumantha Rao, an illustrious student of Dr Mishra, on being conferred Padma Bhushan, said in his felicitation speech: “I learnt precision in writing from Professor Vikas Mishra who was my supervisor for Ph.D thesis. Prof. Mishra used to say, ‘one should always ask whether the sentence that one has written is really necessary’. After reading the first draft of my thesis, he suggested deletion of a number of passages by putting round brackets indicating the portions to be deleted. On one occasion he picked up from his shelf an old draft of his own thesis and showed me the similar round brackets placed by his supervisor, Arthur Lewis who was later to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics.” Contribution Dr Mishra's contributions were often quoted by noted scholars. In their books 'India:Social Structure' and 'Social Transformation in Modern India' noted Indian Sociologist Dr MN Srinivas and Dr A Kumar quoted Prof. Mishra as \\"In his book Hinduism and Economic growth,1962, Dr. Vikas Mishra has made a study of the occupational patterns of the different religious groups in India. He concludes that the occupational distribution of the Parsis, Jews and Jains is “advanced” though not diversified. Hindus and Muslims have a diversified occupational pattern while the tribal's pattern is neither advanced nor diversified. Dr Mishra's analysis points to the conclusion that minority religions are advantageously situated as far as occupational distribution is concerned. It is likely, however, that there are differences between one region of India and another. Syrian Christians, for instance, show a more “advanced” pattern in Travancore than in North Kerala. Similarly, Moplahs in North Kerala are more advanced than their co-coreligionists in South and Central Kerala. This is perhaps related to the fact that in North Kerala the Moplahs formerly wielded political power.\\" Dr Mishra’s concept of his “Growth Multiplier” precedes Professor Hirschman's \\"linkage effects\\" which is clear by his claim in his book \\"The Growth Multiplier and a General Theory of Economic Growth”, pp. 7\\\\. He says “The direct investment effect sounds very much like Professor Hirschman’s linkage effects. But perhaps I should mention that two of my earlier drafts had been circulated before his Strategy of Economic Development was published.” K S Chalam writes in his book Social Enquiry of Development in India, pp.350, Sage Publications,\\"It was Vikas Mishra who studied Hinduism and found that it was not conducive for rapid economic development due to several rigidities and perhaps prepared Raj Krishna later to coin what is called the Hindu rate of growth.\\"Again at pp.372 he writes,'Vikas Mishra was an economist who worked on the Economics of Religion first time in India. Mishra, Hinduism and Economic Growth (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1962). Mishra trained Raj Krishna, Agricultural economist, Member, Planning Commission, who has coined the popular term \\"Hindu rate of growth\\".' Biography Dr Mishra with Mother Teresa at the 17th Covocation of Kurukshetra University The first regular VC of Kurukshetra University Mr Hardwari Lal, invited Dr. Mishra to join the Economics Department as its Head. Mishra served also as Registrar of the University (1969–1970), and was appointed a Professor of Economics in the year 1971. He took over as Vice-Chancellor of the university on 6 April 1978. With an original cast of mind Dr Mishra kept off the beaten track. He was a voracious reader of books, but wanted something far more than mere scholarship. As a teacher, Dr Mishra firmly believed that there was no point in burdening the minds of students. He firmly believed and insisted that a teacher's duty lies in making his students think by developing in them a spirit of enquiry and a habit of critical analysis. That is why he promoted the study of methodology in social sciences, which he thought was the foundation of knowledge. Dr Vikas Mishra conceived the idea of setting up the Social Science Faculty Forum. Fortnightly meetings would take place where faculty members from the departments of History, Economics and Political Science would assemble and take up a specific theme for discussion. Later, teachers from the Science faculty were also invited. Dr Mishra's intellectual honesty can be understood by the fact that he realised that he could not go forward in his research and development contribution to International Economics without a firm grasp of the application of mathematical and statistical techniques to economic theories. His time as the Vice-Chancellor of the University was characterised by his leadership and the immense respect he gave to the teaching community, there was no question of the local or regional virus creeping into the functioning of the university. His view had always been that a University should be international in character. The last year of Dr Mishra's tenure was marred by a few non-teaching strike guided by political motives, which was triggered off by disgruntled elements in the university. Dr Mishra refused to yield to their demands which he thought were unreasonable. Publications Dr Mishra wrote the following books: HINDUISM AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. Oxford University Press,1962.

Due to the truss bodywork, it was difficult to cut doors in the sides of the body so doors at either end of the cars were provided with covered platforms to allow access to the carriages. They became the most numerous group of carriages built for any Australian railway system with a total of 659 carriages built. A further 196 carriages, known as Lucy Suburban Carriages were constructed between 1913 and 1916 but had steel under frames and separate bodywork. While they retained the general layout and appearance of the American Suburban Carriage, they were generally not referred to as such and 193 were later completely rebuilt for use in Electric train stock in the 1920s. The American Suburban carriages were built primarily as suburban passenger carriages for the Sydney network. Following the electrification of the Sydney network in the 1920s and 1930s, most carriages were converted for use on longer distance services, whilst others were transferred to Newcastle and Wollongong for continued suburban service or to country branch lines. The last examples were withdrawn in the mid-1970s. Preservation A number of American Suburban carriages have been preserved.

The ultimate goal is to prove or disprove the possibility of spacetime metric engineering with reasonable amounts of energy. Motivation Visualisation of York time, a measurement of spacetime curvature as induced by the Alcubierre metric. Spacetime metric engineering is a requirement for physically recreating solutions of general relativity such as Einstein–Rosen bridges or the Alcubierre drive. Current experiments focus on the Alcubierre metric and its modifications. Alcubierre's work from 1994 implies that even if the required exotic matter with negative energy densities can be created, the total mass–energy demand for his proposed warp drive would exceed anything that could be realistically attained by human technology. Other researchers aimed to improve the energy efficiency (see ), but the propositions remain mostly speculative. Research groups at NASA's Johnsons Space Center and Dakota State University currently aim to experimentally evaluate several new approaches, especially a redesigned energy-density topology as well as an implication of brane cosmology theory. If space actually were to be embedded in higher dimensions, the energy requirements could be decreased dramatically and a comparatively small energy density could already lead to a spacetime curvature measurable using an interferometer. The theoretical framework for the experiments dates back to work by Harold G. White from 2003 as well as work by White and Eric W. Davis from 2006 that was published in the AIP, where they also consider how baryonic matter could, at least mathematically, adopt characteristics of dark energy (see section below). In the process, they described how a toroidal positive energy density may result in a spherical negative-pressure region, possibly eliminating the need for actual exotic matter. Theoretical framework The metric derived by Alcubierre was mathematically motivated by cosmological inflation. The original \\"warp-drive\\" spacetime metric can be written in (t,x,y,z) coordinates as: It uses the curve (world line) x=x_s(t),y=0,z=0 where x_s expresses the x-coordinate position of the moving spaceship frame. The radius r_s=[(x-x_s(t))^2+y^2+z^2] is the euclidean distance from the curve. Furthermore, c is the speed of light and v_s(t) is equivalent to dx_s/dt, the velocity associated with the curve. The shaping function f(r_s) is any smooth function that satisfies f(0)=1 and decreases from the origin, vanishing at r_s>R for some point R. The driving phenomenon behind the apparently arbitrary velocity (including v_s>c) could be (and was) postulated to be the York extrinsic time, \\\\Theta, defined as: It provides for the contraction of space in front, and expansion in the back of the warp bubble. The idea can be seen in some way as an applied extension of the hypothesis that the early universe also saw a rapid inflationary expansion that possibly exceeded the speed of light for some time. However, according to research, it appears that the York time behaviour is merely a side effect of another underlying mechanism. The problem that led to the assumption that York time is only one part in the larger picture is the unusual symmetry in the required energy density. Using the Einstein field equations, the stress energy tensor T^{\\\\mu u} can be derived from the Alcubierre metric, resulting in the necessary energy density: where G is the gravitational constant and \\\\rho=\\\\sqrt{y^2+z^2}. EFE This corresponds to a negative toroidal energy density symmetric to the x-axis. It is notable here, that during a sensitivity analysis for the DARPA-funded 100 Year Starship symposium, Harold White discovered that changing the energy-density distribution from a thin ring as originally proposed to more of a doughnut shape (effectively increasing the warp-bubble wall thickness) can decrease the required total negative energy by several orders of magnitude. The symmetry in the energy distribution leads to the scenario in which the choice of positive x-axis is in fact arbitrary. The warp-drive mechanism would not know whether to go forward or backward along the x-axis. This paradox can be resolved by putting the Alcubierre metric into canonical form using Rindler's method and extracting the potential, \\\\Phi. With the potential it is possible to derive the field equation for the spacetime expansion \\"boost\\", \\\\gamma: Cross-section of the boost topology throughout the sphere The boost can roughly be seen as a scalar multiplier acting on an initial velocity leading to the actual warp-velocity: This boost is also an important analogy when considering higher-dimensional models (as seen below). The expansion and contraction of space as measured by York time are now more of a secondary effect and can be considered equivalent to a pressure gradient of a moving sphere in a fluid. The scalar nature of the effect is an important clue when considering higher dimensions. Considering the null geodesics for v_s>c inside the warp field, it can be seen that the world lines are space- like for external observers, but the moving frame never travels outside its local comoving light cone and thus does not violate special relativity. From there on, White and Davis showed similarities of the spacetime boost when considered in a higher-dimensional spacetime, such as in the Chung-Freese model. In this particular model our space exists on a brane and the space surrounding the brane is called the \\"bulk\\". The size of each extra dimension is considered to be at least finite and the latest research at CERN also constrains any large extra dimension theories. However, the actual size and total number of extra dimensions is not important when considering the implications on the boost field. The modified Robertson–Walker metric representing the model by Chung and Freese is: dX^2+dU^2}} where the dX^2 term specifies our normal space and dU^2 the higher-dimensional bulk with our space located at the U=0 plane. a(t) is a typical cosmological expansion parameter (see accelerated expansion) and k is an arbitrary compactification factor for the extra dimensions. Considering the null geodesic solutions (ds^2=0) allows to develop the following relationship: {a(t)}\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{dU^2}{c^2dt^2}}}} For zero U the expected speed of the photon is , as expected. For large off- bulk coordinates U\\\\gg 1 the speed d/d can be made arbitrarily large. That means that light rays could have a spacelike appearance, an obvious parallel to the Alcubierre model. However, in the Alcubierre model the spacetime expansion boost is the driving phenomenon, whereas in the Chung–Freese model the off-brane bulk location U serves this purpose. It is thus theoretically possible that the boost of a 3+1 spacetime model is a scalar correction factor for higher-dimensional geometric effects on our brane, leading the following analogies to Alcubierre's model: If a particle like an electron gains a high spacetime boost relative to an observer, it might actually leave the 3+1 brane (i.e. it gains non-zero bulk coordinates) and its ability to interact electromagnetically diminishes. To illustrate this, White and Davis stated that in a 2D lab located at the x,y plane, a 2D electron that gets accelerated (obtains a high boost) gains a non-zero z coordinate. Thus, if a photon were to interact with it, it would need to be at the same (,,,) coordinate. Considering the null geodesic equation again, one can see that if d/d = , d/d = 0 meaning that light comes to a standstill. This implies that a high hyperspace velocity reduces spacetime's \\"stiffness\\" or ability to resist being curved by energy, effectively reducing the energy requirements to warp it. This observation, together with the modified energy density distribution, first led researchers at NASA to begin thinking of testbeds to verify the new theoretical approach. Using the analogy between and \\\\Phi, it is obvious that a high velocity (d/d) with = 0 requires a field oscillation. Back in the Alcubierre model, it is notable that an outside observer would perceive a uniform potential (from the uniform boost within the sphere) that represents the warp-field region even though it originates from a toroidal energy density. It has similar characteristics as a Gaussian spherical surface held at constant electrostatic potential. To the outside observer, the warp-field sphere has a uniform energy density. By expanding the spherical region while maintaining the same relative boost value for the Gaussian surface, when considering the first law of thermodynamics, the following can be concluded (limited to the 3+1 brane): dE can be replaced by \\\\rho_sdV, which is the total energy for the warp sphere with the same volume change dV as on the right side of the equation. Thus, the equation of state relating the pressure of the warp sphere p_s to its energy density \\\\rho_s is which noticeably resembles the equation of state of cosmological vacuum energy (moreover, it is the equation of state of dark energy). If \\\\rho_s of the original warp sphere is negative, p_s would be positive. However the last equation shows that the opposite is true, \\\\rho_s is positive and p_s is negative. Considering that the spacetime expansion boost for the Alcubierre model can be made arbitrarily high depending on the choice of input variables, a high boost is thereby clearly not an exclusive feature common only to negative energy densities and could be obtained in the lab, provided powerful enough equipment. Difficulties Einstein's field equations show that comparatively high amounts of energy are required for any significant curvature of spacetime under ordinary conditions. With the energy-requirement-decreasing concepts only being partially implemented yet, the available measurement methods are reaching the limits of what is technically possible. That is why current results remain mostly inconclusive until measurements can be further refined or the effect can be increased. New experimental setups have been proposed to boost sensitivity, and using the higher-dimensional yet still purely theoretical approach may increase any effect sufficiently to obtain significant results to prove or disprove the theory. Current and proposed experiments STAIF conference proceedings The only reported warp-field experiment currently being conducted is on a modified Michelson–Morley interferometer as proposed by Harold White and Eric Davis in 2003. This setup includes a ring-shaped energy device using high-voltage barium-titanate ceramic capacitors to attempt to warp space as shown in the diagram. White announced at a 2013 space conference that the first experimental results from this device were inconclusive. A time-of-flight experiment was proposed in 2013 using a modified Fabry–Pérot interferometer.

It is also the first film to use the camera system known as 2P. It was filmed in Almería. It is produced by Francesco Genesi, Vincenzo Genesi, Daniele Senatore, Stefano Melpignano and Jose Lopez Moreno, scored by Nico Massi and edited by Rosa G. Salgado. Plot At the start of the story the band of Sanchez ambushes a military transport escorting $100,000 to Omaha. He leaves together with two men to take the money to Mexico, while the other gang members dress in the uniforms of the dead soldiers and continue the transport, to use this as a cover to enter and rob the bank of Omaha. This nifty plan is undone by the bounty hunter Hank Fellow, who has been watching the attack in the telescopic sight of his rifle – without firing or otherwise interfering. He then takes his time following Sanchez’ group, unnerving the men with some long range pot shots, before confronting and killing them in a stand up gunfight at close range. Then he hurries back to warn the town, and the ”soldiers” are ambushed at the bank and killed, most of them by Fellows himself. The mine owner Collins, who urgently needs to ship a load of gold past the dangerous gang of Gus Kennebeck, suggests a deal – Fellows cuts up his 10% reward as an insurance, and gets the double amount back if he manages to get the gold to Omaha and keep it there until a military escort picks it up. Fellows accepts, and when Kennebeck’s gang waits in ambush, the bounty killer picks off a few of them, which makes Kennebeck hold off the attack. At night Fellows has the gold taken away from the bank, and refuses to tell Collins where it is. The same night he has observed Kennebeck visiting a woman in town, Isabelle, and the next day he captures Kennebeck’s captain Machete after a visit there. The sheriff and his men beat up Machete until he confesses to them that Isabelle is Kennebeck’s woman, and when the gang will attack. When the bandits attack, Fellows blows up a bridge on their way to town. They attack from other directions against the citizens waiting in prepared positions. After a lot of casualties on both sides the bandits reach the bank and make their way into the vault, where Fellows has prepared a barrel of explosives connected to the telegraph line. When a signal is given that they are inside, Fellows orders the telegraph operator to start sending, and the remaining bandits are killed in an explosion. Kennebeck did not take part in the attack, but when he learns about the outcome he arrives to fight Fellows. He challenges him to drop the rifle with the telescopic sight. When his two remaining men appear, and are killed before they can shoot, Kennebeck goes for that rifle but is shot by Fellows through the sight. When the military troop arrives the banker discloses that the gold has been disguised as the new stairs of the bank. Fellows is paid and leaves. On the road he observes the military transport being ambushed by another gang of bandits, and grins.

The film grossed a total of 495.449 million Italian lire in Italy. Reception In his investigation of narrative structures in Spaghetti Western films, Fridlund writes that Per il gusto di uccidere, unlike influential Spaghetti Western films like For a Few Dollars More or Django, presents a protagonist who is always in control. The developments never put him at the mercy of any villain, so he is never subject to torture. He does not go out of his way to pursue a second motive, and his choices do not put any loved ones of his in danger. However, these kinds of complications are not missing, but instead befall other characters in the story.Fridlund, Bert: The Spaghetti Western. A Thematic Analysis.

Biography During World War II, Gregory was a prisoner of war in a German camp for military officers. After the war he graduated from the École Polytechnique and École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Paris, then went to the United States to study fundamental particle interactions in high-energy cosmic rays. After earning his Ph.D. in 1950 at MIT, under the supervision of Professor Bruno Rossi, Gregory returned to France. He became known in the high energy physics world in the 1950s when he worked as a researcher, with the title of deputy director, under Professor Leprince- Ringuet at the École Polytechnique. At the École Polytechnique he worked with a number of physicists including Charles Peyrou, Jean Crussard, André Lagarrigue, and later André Astier. In 1958, Gregory was appointed professor of physics at the Polytechnique. Around 1960, Gregory got involved in the bubble chambers research. He directed the work on the 81 cm Saclay Bubble Chamber, developed by the technical services at Saturne for the laboratory of the École Polytechnique, and was subsequently brought to CERN PS in Geneva. He was Directorate Member for Research at CERN from 1964 to 1965. From 1966 to 1970, he was Director General of CERN. At CERN, he supervised most of the construction of the world's first hadron collider, the Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR). Following his mandate as CERN Director-General, Gregory returned to the Polytechnique laboratory in Paris. Soon he became director-general of the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), which he led from 1973 to 1976. The same year, he became Délégué général à la Recherche scientifique et technique (DGRST). Gregory was elected president for the CERN Council for 1978, but died before entering this position.

The R4 (also known as Revolution for DS) is a series of flash cartridges for the Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS handheld system. It allows ROMs and homebrew to be booted on the Nintendo DS handheld system from a microSD card. This allows the user to run homebrew applications, to store multiple games on a single memory card, and to play games that have been backed up by the user. The R4 flashcard's original developer stopped producing the R4 Card that plays ROMs and homebrew for the Nintendo DS, however, there are a new line of R4 clones that have taken its place, notably the R4 3DS, R4 Gold, R4 DSi and R4 NES, which are used to play ROMs and homebrew from various Nintendo platforms such as the Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo DSi, Nintendo DSi XL and Nintendo Entertainment System. Some of these cartridges can also store a 3DS boot image; a 3DS can in turn be made to boot from the cartridge by way of an undocumented button combination recognized by the system's bootloader. Since the 3DS's secure boot signature validation has been broken, this provides a useful means of installing custom firmware on a 3DS. Original cards The original R4 cards use a microSD (<=2GB) card for its firmware and games, and does not support SDHC microSD cards. The original Revolution for DS card is no longer available in stores, although it can be bought online. However, there are other cards that are of similar quality made by other entities that have adapted the name, commonly referred as 1:1 clones. These are flash cards that use exactly the same hardware and are, for all intents and purposes, also referred to as the original R4 revolution. However, they often include SDHC support and other small changes and add-ons that make them different to the original R4 cards. However, using the official kernel for a clone card from the clone card's manufacturer can result in the card ceasing to function once a certain amount of time has passed, leading many consumers to compare the card to a sort of time bomb. Legal issues The R4 flash cartridges are banned in some countries due to copyright infringement lawsuits from Nintendo. In late 2007, Nintendo began a legal crackdown with a series of raids against R4 merchants. =United Kingdom= In 2010, the company Playables Limited, importers of R4 flashcards, was ruled against by the London High Court. The ruling outlawed any sales, importation, or advertising of the R4 flashcards. The defence of Playables Limited claimed that the R4 flashcards were legal because it uses a homebrew application. However, bypassing Nintendo's security system is against the law in the United Kingdom. After the news broke, Nintendo released on a statement saying that they do support game developers that create their own applications legitimately. 100,000 copying devices including R4s were seized in 2009. Nintendo claimed that the cards were not only seized for the benefit of their own company, but the benefit for over 1400 video game companies that depend on the sales of their games. =France= In October 2011, the R4 cards were banned in France. While Nintendo's original lawsuit was dismissed on the basis that the devices could be used to make homebrews and develop software in 2009, the 2011 ruling reversed this, and the Paris court of appeals ruled against five R4 sellers and distributors. The sellers and distributors were fined over €460,000, and some were sentenced to jail. Stephan Bole, the managing director of Nintendo France released a statement saying \\"Nintendo supported this criminal action not only for the company’s sake, but for the interests of its game developer partners who spend time and money legitimately developing software for Nintendo’s game platforms, and customers who expect the highest standards and integrity from products bearing the Nintendo name.\\" =Japan= In 2009, the government of Japan outlawed the sales of the R4 flashcard. In 2012, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry revealed that the importing of R4 cards, and similar devices, is now punishable by law. In 2013, Nintendo won a court case against two R4 card distributors in Japan. The Tokyo district court ruled that the sellers of the R4 cards owed Nintendo and 49 other video game developers ¥95,625,000. =Germany= In 2009, Nintendo lost a lawsuit against a seller of flashcards, however Nintendo won the second and final instance. Since December 2014, flashcards are officially illegal due to Germany's copyright law. The seller and distributor of the R4 flashcards was fined over €1 million. = Italy = In 2009, Nintendo started a lawsuit against a seller of flashcards, which lasted three instances and ended only in 2017 with the sentence of the seller, however the punishment is undisclosed. Curiously, in another trial held in 2016 Court of Catania declared flashcards legal since they have been exchanged for microSD-to-DScart adapters, citing the fact the R4 is not able to run any copyrighted code without a kernel, which is not sold with the flashcard, and the hardware-embedded protection breaking functionalities were considerate legitimate to run unsigned code. =Other countries= Other countries that have banned the R4 flashcards include Australia, Belgium, and the Netherlands.

It is a type of aside, consisting of cutaways to a close-up shot of one (or occasionally more) cast members talking directly to camera. Confessionals are used to provide narration, exposition, and commentary on ongoing action within the show. While confessionals are typically presented as an immediate reaction to events in the show (an illusion enforced by the use of the present tense), they are generally filmed later, sometimes much later, and often at another location. Cutaway interviews have their origin in documentary filmmaking. Confessionals in the modern sense may have begun with The People's Court, in which litigants gave interviews to the court reporter after arguing their case, in the style of post-game interviews. Judge Judy later dropped the court reporter from these interactions, and had litigants speak directly to camera. Confessionals were also used on MTV's The Real World, which debuted in 1992. Confessionals have been criticized as a \\"gimmick\\" of the reality TV genre that has lost its freshness and purpose, and their introduction to more traditional game shows has been derided. The confessional device has been deployed in scripted series parodying the reality genre, most notably The Office.

History  Because normal forces could not be employed on reconnaissance and combat tasks in the high mountains of the Alps, in 1916 Alpine Streif companies (Streifkompanien) were established. They were renamed in 1917 to Hochgebirgskompanien (\\"Alpine companies\\" or, literally \\"high mountain companies\\"). The members of these companies represented all the ethnic groups of the monarchy together. They all had previous Alpine experience, either as a result of their agricultural experience or as Alpine tourists before the war, and were specifically trained for fighting in the mountains. The specially selected officers and men of the mountain companies were issued with Alpine equipment, and were intended, and in practice were able, to overcome natural obstacles even in the most difficult terrain.  Mission  The mission of this specialist force (or Schwarm) was to secure and maintain climbing paths and routes in high-Alpine terrain, as well as to make military supply routes practicable. For this, they were equipped with wire cables, rope ladders, iron bars and other equipment.  Organisation  An Alpine company was divided into a company HQ, three rifle platoons and a machine gun platoon equipped with two 07/12 machine guns, three to four mountain guide patrols, two telephone patrols and a technical section. The replacement of personnel came from the units available in the respective branch of the army. Those battle casualty replacement battalions (Ersatzbataillone) from which the majority of the men in the individual companies originated, were designated as a replacement cadres; as a result they could be units in the Common Army or the k.k. Landwehr.  Equipment  The personal equipment of a soldier in the Alpine companies consisted of: rucksack, alpenstock, snowshoes (Schneereifen), snow goggles, mountaineering boots, Krötteln (crampons) and, in accordance with regulations of 1918 for the equipment and clothing in mountain warfare: a pair of ten-pointed crampons, full ski equipment, avalanche cord, a pair of shoe covers, a pair of overmitts, a windcheater, windproof trousers and a snowsuit or – in its absence – a snow jacket. The Alpine companies were among the most highly decorated units of the imperial forces. Several members were awarded the Military Order of Maria Theresa, for example, Lieutenant Peter Scheider of the 17 Alpine Coy for the capture of the Monticello Ridge on the Tonale Pass (together with the 28 Coy under Lieutenant Toni Kaaserer) in the summer of 1918 during Operation Avalanche (Unternehmen Lawine).

Lo spaghetti western secondo Tonino Valerii, Unmondoaparte, Roma 2008.

Valerii's latest film My Name is Nobody (1973) was his most popular to date. Valerii and screenwriter Massimo De Rita started developing a few ideas and had three story outlines for the film. These ideas were an omnibus film about a police patrol on a night shift, the second was a revenge film that Valerii described as \\"in the vein of Death Wish\\" about a lawyer who uses his knowledge of crime to seek revenge on gangs. The last idea was a story about a bodyguard. Valerii saw a newspaper on Gori's desk about a wealthy Italian industrialist who moved abroad in fear of being kidnapped. Feeling that the story captured the era that Italy was in, they decided on the story of the bodyguard (or gorillas as they were nicknamed). Valerii says they convinced Gori on the film when De Rita told him the title \\"Go Gorilla!\\". Valerii cast Fabio Testi in the role after he had been in a few films (Blood River and Red Coat) that did poorly in the box office. Al Lettieri had a small role as Testi's best friend in the film. It would be one of Lettieri's final roles as he died of a heart attack on October 18, 1975. For the villain, Valerii cast Antonio Marsina who had recently given up acting after a few roles in 1960s Westerns and had become a photographer. Marsina arrived with his girlfriend who auditioned for a part but was not cast. Valerii thought that Marsina had an interesting face and got him to do a screen test which got him the role. Valerii stated that the film's script was written quickly with a lot of dialogue being re-written in the editing room to \\"rescue\\" a few scenes. The film was shot at De Paolis Studios in Rome. Release Go Gorilla Go was distributed in Italy by Cineriz on November 14, 1975. The film received a v.m. 18 rating in Italy, making it not permitted to an audience under the age of 18. When this happened, Cecci Gori insisted that Valerii cut the most violent scenes as requested. Valerii did not accept this and no cuts were made. The film was a great box office success in Italy, where it grossed a total of 1,846,285,530 Italian lire. It re-launched Fabio Testi's career as one of Italy's most popular action film actors.

Dating from the 13th to the 14th century, the church has unusually richly decorated portals. It belongs to the Diocese of Visby of the Church of Sweden. History Carved stone decorations in the main portal A first stone church was built in Romanesque style here during the 12th century. The oldest part of presently visible church however, is the tower dating from the first half of the 13th century. The rest of the Romanesque church was eventually pulled down and replaced with a Gothic main building. Thus the choir and the vestry are from the end of the 13th century, while the nave was built during the early 14th century. When the nave was constructed, the choir was also modestly \\"modernised\\" by the insertion of the presently visible eastern window. Original plans probably intended to eventually also replace the comparatively small tower with a more proportional, Gothic church tower. The church retains much of its medieval character. A restoration was carried out in 1937. Architecture The church has two unusually richly sculptured portals. The choir portal display carved foliage and a few figures: two fish and a lion. The main portal is crowned by a sculpture of Saint Michael wielding a club and carrying a shield, sitting astride the wimperg. Underneath, the capitals are profusely sculpted with scenes from the apocalypse. Other capitals are decorated with foliage ornamentation. Both of the portals may have been made by the stone sculptor or workshop known by its modern notname Egypticus, which was active on Gotland. Some of the church windows display original stained glass paintings, displaying architectural motifs, foliage and a depiction of Bartholomew the Apostle. The church's altarpiece is a curious mix between Gothic wooden sculptures, evidently stemming from an earlier (14th century) altarpiece, incorporated into a Baroque altar from 1701. The church also has a notable triumphal cross, where the figure of Jesus is 15th century but the cross itself from the 17th. The pews, the pulpit and baptismal font are all from the 17th and 18th centuries.

The history of Tsinghua University spans over a century since it was founded in 1911. The school is located on the site of Tsinghua Garden in Beijing, the former residence of Yinzhi, the third son of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty. In 1909, the indemnity payment to the United States from the Boxer Protocol was reduced by US$10.8 million by Theodore Roosevelt's administration. The Qing imperial court used the difference to create the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Programme and established the China Institute along with a preparatory school. The school was later renamed Tsinghua School and expanded in 1925 with the addition of a college department. It was officially chartered as a national university by the Nationalist Government of the Republic of China in 1928. After the onset of Second Sino-Japanese War, Tsinghua was relocated to Changsha along with Peking University and Nankai University to form National Changsha Provisional University. The combined school was relocated to Kunming in 1938 and renamed as National Southwest Associated University. In 1946, Tsinghua University was restored and resumed its operation after the school was relocated back to Tsinghua Garden. After a series of education policy reform beginning in 1952, Tsinghua transformed into the top institute dedicated to science and technology in National Key Universities. In the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, the school was elevated again through the introduction of Project 211 and Project 985 that aimed to improve the research standard of higher education in China.  Background  Bond for Boxer Rebellion Indemnity The history of Tsinghua originated in the Boxer Protocol signed in 1901. The Qing dynasty had to pay war reparations amounting to US$333 million with four percent annual interest rate in taels of fine silver to the Eight-Nation Alliance, in which the United States had a share of US$24,440,778.81. With difficulties in settling the debt, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs instructed the Chinese ambassador Liang Cheng to negotiate with United States. On 5 December, Liang had the first meeting with United States Secretary of State John Hay, in which Hay proposed that the reparations exceeded the original demand from the United States, and the reduction of payment was settled. With approval from the United States Congress, President Theodore Roosevelt authorised the further reduction of the reparation down to US$13,655,492.69. The remaining difference was to be returned to China, gradually starting in January 1909 for educational programmes, and to create scholarship programmes for Chinese students to study in the United States. To honour Theodore Roosevelt for his contributions to the founding of Tsinghua University, a gymnasium on the Tsinghua campus was named Roosevelt Memorial Gymnasium. On 11 July 1908, the document for reduction of reparation was delivered to the Qing imperial court by ambassador William Woodville Rockhill. Prince Qing responded to the United States government as follows: Tang Shaoyi was dispatched to the United States to deliver the official letter from the Qing imperial court. The letter says: The first batch of Chinese students to study in the United States in 1909 The United States government begin to remit the difference in 1909. In May, Tenney Charles Daniel was assigned to represent the United States government in the study programme. The selection of students was finalised after a series of discussion in June, and the proposal received the imperial approval on 10 July. The office for the study programme was officially set up on 17 July.有“游美学务处”建立于“6月或7月”、“六月初四日”等说法，但根据《游美学务处为报宣统元年全年经费事致外务部呈文》，应为“六月初一”，即1909年7月17日。 On 25 August, Zhou Ziqi周自齐在1909年初授外务部右参议，署（“代理”之意）左参议，5月补任左参议，8月署右丞，不久改为署左丞。8月25日，兼任学部丞参上行走并出任游美学务处总办。此时，其职位有四：外务部署左丞、外务部左参议、学部丞参上行走、游美学务处总办，官品为候补三四品京堂。后于1922年代行中华民国北京政府总统。 and Tang Guo'an were appointed to the board of directors to run the office operations.

During the Cultural Revolution = Early Cultural Revolution = The Tsinghua University High School was the cradle for the Cultural Revolution's Red Guard movement. Beginning in the early 1960s, the attached high school's cadres promoted the ideology of class struggle based in familial pride. At the beginning of May 1966, some students, under the influence of the 5-16 Circular, posted a big character poster stating \\"participate in this class struggle in the most positive and self- aware way\\", receiving resistance from the school authorities. On the night of May 29, a handful of upper-grade students, after group delibrations at the Old Summer Palace ruins, decided to name their movement the \\"red guards\\", meaning \\"Mao Zedong's red guards\\". On June the 2nd, they posted the big character poster \\"Pledge our lives to defend Mao Zedong thought, pledge our lives to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat\\" in response to Nie Yuanzi's big- character poster at Peking University, attracting students from surrounding secondary schools to sign their names in support. Between June 24 and July 27, the Tsinghua University High School posted three big character posters, the ensemble of which was entitled \\"long live the proletariat class's revolutionary spirit of rebellion!\\" The first two portions were passed on to Chairman Mao Zedong, who responded with support on August 1. The contents of the big character posters were carried in full by the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine. On 8 occasions, Mao Zedong met the red guards in person, pushing the red guard movement into the milieu of university students and the general public. The red guards began campaigns such as destroying the four olds and promoting the \\"right to link up\\". On the afternoon of August 24, 1966, the historical secondary gate to the university was pulled down by the red guards to symbolize their opposition to feudalism and capitalism and their support for Marxist–Leninist revisionism. On the same site, a giant sculpture of Mao Zedong was raised on May 4, 1967, reported in the People's Daily as a \\"spectacular event\\", inciting a wave of construction of similar sculptures across the country. On June 8, 1966, a task force led by Ye Lin with participation from Chinese President Liu Shaoqi and his wife Wang Guangmei entered Tsinghua University, attacking principal Jiang Nanyu and other cadres as \\"capitalist roaders\\", \\"counterrevolutionary academic authorities\\", and \\"cow demons and snake spirits\\", took over the Tsinghua party committee, and criticized rebellious students. Radical students like Peng Dafu from the university's engineering chemistry faculty resisted. On June 21, in what has since been called the \\"June 21st incident\\", Peng lambasted the task force, claiming that it did not represent the revolution, and demanded to seize power. The taskforce criticized Peng, revoked his party credentials, and detained him for 18 days. At least 50 people were condemned for being sympathetic to Peng;500 people were implicated, and several attempted suicides occurred, causing two deaths. In July, Mao Zedong returned to Beijing, condemned the task force, supported the radicals, and hinted at disagreements with Liu Shaoqi. In late August, several large-character posters condemning Liu were posted in the Tsinghua Garden. In October, a large-character poster exclaiming \\"defeat Liu Shaoqi\\" was posted in the same garden. On December 19, 1966, under commands from the \\"proletariat headquarters\\", the \\"Tsinghua University Jinggangshan Corps\\", Tsinghua's largest red guard organization with defeating Liu Shaoqi as its purpose, was established. Peng Dafu became its leader and was nicknamed \\"commander Peng\\". On December 25, commanded by the Cultural Revolution Group, the Tsinghua University Jinggangshan Corps' 5000 members led a protest against President Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, spreading the Cultural Revolution into the entirety of Beijing. On January 6, 1967, Peng Dafu and others implemented the so-called \\"strategically seize Wang Guangmei\\" plan, using the supposed injury of Liu Shaoqi's daughter Liu Pingping as bait to lure wife Wang Guangmei out and detain her. On April 10, with the agreement of the \\"proletariat headquarters\\", the \\"Jinggangshan corps\\" rallied tens of thousands of people for the public denunciation of Wang Guangmei. More than 300 radical organizations participated in the event. On April 14, 1967, due to internal disputes over major issues in the Cultural Revolution, the Jinggangshan red guards split into the \\"Corps headquarters\\" and the \\"414 faction\\". The two parties had rather large-scale disputes over the representatives who were to make up the revolutionary committee. The \\"headquarters\\" and \\"414 faction\\", on the radical and conservative sides of the red guard movement respectively, both declared themselves to be the proper representatives of the proletariat. The two factions had disputes over three core issues: how should the \\"Cultural Revolution\\" be understood? How should the first ten years of the Cultural Revolution be seen? How should cadres be treated? In the winter of 1967, to prevent chaos, the Chinese government demanded that all students return to school to engage in \\"revolution in the classroom\\". In March 1968, following the \\"Yang, Yu, Bo incident\\", the Cultural Revolution Group launched a campaign against \\"rightist inclinations\\". Tensions between the two factions at Tsinghua again began to rise, leading to incessant small-scale clashes. Between April 23 and July 27 in 1968, the opposing red guard factions erupted into the \\"100-day clashes\\", the most severe clashes to occur during the Cultural Revolution in Beijing. Red guards used batons, stones, landmines, grenades, improvised guns, improvised cannons, toxic arrows, semiautomatic weapons, molotov cocktails, and improvised armored vehicles. They occupied and looted the grand auditorium and other important buildings. The clashes caused 18 deaths and more than 1100 injuries, and rendered 30 people disabled for life. Direct economic loses reached at least ten million. At the end of the skirmishes, the \\"414 faction\\" was forced to surrender by the \\"headquarters faction\\". On July 27, the Chinese Central Committee, seeking to stop the clashes in higher-education schools, placed the Ministry of Education under military control. On the same day, a 30,000-strong Mao Zedong thought propaganda team led by 61889 Regiment deputy regimental commander Zhang Rongwen entered Tsinghua. The \\"headquarters faction\\" red guards refused to surrender and publicly resisted the propaganda team, using spears, grenades, and rifles to attack its members. 5 propaganda team members were killed and 731 injured in an incident that astonished the city of Beijing. The \\"July 27th incident\\" directly led to Mao Zedong finally ordering the end of public clashes. On 3:00 AM Beijing Time on the following day, Mao Zedong and Lin Biao held an emergency meeting with the \\"five important leaders\\" of the red guards, including Peng Dafu, demanding an end to armed clashes and the welcoming of the propaganda team into Tsinghua. = Mid-to- Late Cultural Revolution = In August 1968, the propaganda team began to \\"re- educate\\" the students at the school. Students were sent en masse to countryside farms and factories. Beginning in the end of 1968, the propaganda team launched the \\"every man must line up, every level must get down to earth\\" campaign, leading to numerous suicides or suicidal attempts, causing approximately 16 \\"irregular deaths\\".According to estimates, the irregular death count at Tsinghua during the Cultural Revolution reached 52. In 1969, the school constructed a model farm in Nanchang County and sent down 2821 educational staff to engage in labour. In that year, 747 people contracted confirmed cases of schistosomiasis and 1111 people were suspected of having contracted the disease. In the following year, the number of confirmed schistosomiasis patients surpassed one thousand people; the medical department of Tsinghua University had to continue to treat and examine schistosomiasis patients until 1997. One person remarked that \\"at the model farm, labour was seen as the punishment for academics; only those who completely obeyed the propaganda team were seen as having been completely reeducated. It was pure enslavement.\\" Beginning in 1970, Tsinghua engaged in an \\"educational revolution\\" based on Mao Zedong thought that lasted until the end of the Cultural Revolution. The \\"educational revolution\\" consisted of the following facets. Firstly, the working class was to direct all activities; the propaganda team, party committee, and revolutionary committee were to hold power. Secondly, the current faculty was to be reformed while also performing their duties. Thirdly, the school was to engage in industrial activities and faculty and students were to fully commit to industrial production (which, in reality, disrupted education and research). Fourthly, Worker-Peasant-Soldier students were to be enrolled. Fifthly, the old curriculum and educational materials were to be replaced with new proletariat educational material based on educational material from the Soviet Union. Finally, the institution was to follow the path of the people and uphold the Cultural Revolution's new educational method, which, in practice, meant public denunciations. Between 1970 and 1975, Tsinghua University made large-scale changes to its organization. In 1970, the school planned to put in place three factories, the experimental chemistry factory, automotive factory, and the precise instrument and machine tool factory. The school now had seven majors: electrical engineering, industrial automation, chemical engineering, infrastructure engineering, hydraulic works engineering, engineering physics, and engineering mechanics mathematics. There was a mechanical repair military company and also basic university courses. The school had two \\"branch campuses\\": the Mianyang campus and the Jiangxi campus (the model farm at Nanchang). In 1972, a rural campus was established in Daxing and a hydraulics works facility was established in Sanmenxia. The school opened further education courses for industrial workers, professional further studies courses, short-term training courses, part-time courses, and local sites to offer education to worker- peasant-soldier students outside major campuses. On June 27, 1970, after a four-year-long hiatus in normal admissions, worker-peasant-soldier students began to be admitted. Mao Zedong directed the school to shorten the length of its education to three years. Student recruitment was done through recommendation by the general public, approval by cadres, and examination by the school. After graduation, students were to be returned to their original working units. After October 15, similar schemes were implemented at other institutes of higher education. The last class of worker-peasant-soldier students graduated in 1981. In 1975, Deng Xiaoping's power in the country's government increased. In August and October, vice general secretaries of Tsinghua's party committee Liu Bing, Liu Yi'an and Hui Xianjun as well as political work department director Lu Fangzheng wrote letters passed on through Deng Xiaoping to Mao Zedong expressing their strong dislike of the de facto leaders of Tsinghua, Chi Qun and Xie Jingyi from the propaganda team. Mao saw this as a form of rebellion against the Cultural Revolution and becan criticizing Liu Bing and other cadres who wrote the letter and Deng Xiaoping. By mid-November, this became a large debate about the \\"educational revolution\\". In December, it evolved into the nationwide Counterattack the Right-Deviationist Reversal-of-Verdicts Trend movement. In this final mass movement of the Cultural Revolution, under the leadership of Chi Qun, Tsinghua University practically ceased its normal educational activities in order to \\"condemn Deng\\" and invite cadres and citizens from across the world to \\"study at\\" and \\"visit\\" Tsinghua. Within a period of ten months, hundreds of thousands of big-character posters were posted and Liu Bing was subjected to criticism and denunciation 214 times.清华大学报. 1978-10-28. On March 31, 1976, after the death of Zhou Enlai, Chi Qun demanded that \\"Tsinghua must not send a single flower wreath to Tiananmen\\". On April 3, some students sent white flowers to the Monument to the People's Heroes, becoming part of the Tiananmen Incident, known in Chinese as the April 5th movement. On the night of the 6th, Chi Qun referred to the movement as an \\"organized, purposeful, planned, sequential counterrevolutionary assault\\". Being defined as such, the movement was subjected to the arrests of \\"counterrevolutionaries\\" and the censorship of \\"counterrevolutionary political rumours\\". By June 10, more than 100 people had been investigated, 38 had been subjected to school-level isolation, and one person had been arrested. In October 1976, the Gang of Four was toppled and the Cultural Revolution ended. On October 16, the Communist Party committee in Beijing began efforts to restore the University. The revolutionary committee system was abolished the following year.

St. Gobhan of Seagoe in Iveagh Clans, landscapes and borders A holy man named St. Gobhan (St Goban-Gobban-Goba) is associated with the foundation , of a church of Celtic Christianity origins in the parish of Seagoe, Portadown, County Armagh, Northern Ireland.Place Names NI - Home The present St. Gobhan's church is a post reformation Church of Ireland and is located within the Diocese of Down and Dromore (of the Church of Ireland), or alternatively the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dromore.Area Deanery of Clanbrassil  Down and DromoreDromore Diocese The 17th century Irish historian and hagiographer John Colgan wrote of this location: \\"Gobanus – Goba of Teg da-goba – Seagoe, on the bank of the Bann in Iveagh of Ulidia (also) St. Gobanus of Killamery, near the mountain called Slievenaman.\\"Acta Sanctoriam Hiberniae, 750b Ireland early peoples and politics Situated four miles due south of Lough Neagh, St. Gobhan's church stands on a high- commanding ridge overlooking and to the east of the upper river Bann in a region where three counties almost meet – County Armagh, County Down and County Antrim. When St. Gobhan first arrived in this locale almost one and a half thousand years ago he was in the lands of the Uí Echach Cobo whose territory would later become the baronies of Upper & Lower Iveagh, in modern- day County Down.Ireland's History in Maps - Ancient Uladh, Ulidia, the Kingdom of UlsterGuinness or MacGuinness family pedigreehttp://www.smo.uhi.ac.uk/~oduibhin/oirthear/downmaps.htm In this old barony map Seagoe is located just beyond the western border of Lower Iveagh, having been annexed to county Armagh in 1605.(seagoe is just below the letter H in ARMAGH boundary line.) This boundary remained for many centuries until the Plantation of Ulster when in 1605 \\"The land east of the Upper Bann on the shore of Lough Neagh, known as Clanbrassilagh was formally annexed to the County of Ardmaghe...becoming eventually the barony of Oneilland East\\".The Ulster PlantationThe Scots in Ulster: Scottish LandlordsPlace-Names of Northern Ireland, Vol.111, County Down. Publisher; Queen's University Belfast.1993 The continuous spread of urban development and the re- designation of boundaries has masked or obliterated the ancient topography allowing many small and independent hamlets to be swallowed up. Seagoe continued its independent existence until in 1888 the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 facilitated its inclusion into Portadown Urban District. So although present-day Seagoe by definition is in county Armagh, its location and ancient history displays an affinity and tenuous bond of ecclesiastical ties with the lands within the historical diocese of Down and Dromore. The original foundation of St. Gobhan's church is in the ancient cemetery some one hundred yards distance from the present church. The old church ruins set amid tall Yew trees and ornate headstones are a poignant reminder of many past incarnations. Gobban of Killamery Whether political upheaval or ecclesiastical differences precipitated St. Gobban's departure from OldLeighlin is unclear. However, prior to the highly important synod of 633, it would appear that he left his monastery and along with numerous monks journeyed into the west of the kingdom of Ossory. Again whether or not he founded or inherited the monastery at Killamery:Cill lamraidhe in Ossory is disputed; however, during his abbacy, its fame and importance flourished. The 9th-century book - \\"The Martyrology of Oengus states “of Gobban of Cell Lamraide in Hui Cathrenn in the west of Ossory, a thousand monks it had, as experts say and of them was Gobban.\\",Martyrology of Oengus,page 425 The Killamery High Cross has become famous as part of the west Ossory group of High crosses.

However prior to its breakup during the Cambro-Norman invasion of Ireland, Ui Ferba not only included the forementioned lands but also included territory to the west of Tralee in the Dingle/Corkaguiny peninsular.https://archive.org/stream/journalofroyalso40royauoft#page/n131/mode/2uphttps://www.academia.edu/2058460/Lordship_and_colony_in_Anglo- Norman_Kerry_1177-1400https://www.academia.edu/2058454/The_see- lands_of_the_diocese_of_Ardfert_an_essay_in_reconstruction Scattered and embedded into this primitive landscape of stone age dolmens and Iron Age forts are the very foundation stones of early Irish medieval ecclesiastical sites. Many of these early Christian sites have been lost to the vagaries of time, man, and nature. However many still exist to some extent: one of which is the ancient ecclesiastic site of Rattoo, with its famous round tower. The estate of the Abbey and churches of Rattoo arose within the ancient ecclesiastical see of Ardferthttp://www.libraryireland.com/topog/A/Ardfert-Diocese-of.php in the cantred of Altry bordering Ui Ferba, within the over kingdom of Ciarraige Luachra and was founded by - \\"the gentle bishop Lugdach\\".https://archive.org/stream/martyrologyofoen29oenguoft#page/214/mode/2uphttps://archive.org/stream/martyrologyofoen29oenguoft#page/220/mode/2up This ecclesastical site, which was reported to consist of seven churches was long known as \\"Rath Muighe tuaiscirt\\" - the fort of the northern plain. This bishop Lugdach, could be the father of Gobban find mac Lugdach and this ecclesiaastical enclosure might not only be St. Gobhan's birthplace: but also that of his real final resting abode. It is generally regarded that St. Gobhan was buried, or his holy relics preserved at the celebrated monastery of St. Fintan of Clonenagh(Cluain Ednech), county Laois. However St. Gobhan had no apparent ecclesiastical ties to this historic establishment. An examination of the etymology of Cluain Eidhneachhttp://www.logainm.ie/en/28686?s=Clonenagh may be instructive. The meaning of the middle Irish word Cluain is invariably found to be a piece of fertile land surrounded by a bog or moor, or on one side by a bog, and the other by water. Also the word eidnech/eidhneach refers to an area of ivy-clad trees.http://edil.qub.ac.uk/dictionary/results- new.php?srch=eidnech&dictionary;_choice=edil_2012 In summary an area of raised fertile land surrounded by bog/swamp. A few miles to the north of Ratoo the river Feale, Brick and Gale converge: thus united they become the Cashen river which flows some six more miles before emptying into Cashen bay on the River Shannon estuary. The low ground south of the Cashen river was known as cashen bog. The church of Rattoo lies within this bog, though now much reduced: however one and a half thousand years ago this topography would have been more apparent. The church of Rattoo adjoins the ancient townland of Clooneagh:Cluain Each.http://www.logainm.ie/en/23909http://maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V1,487695,633627,6,9 \\\\- while seven miles west of Tralee, on the Corkaguiny peninsular is the old church of Kilgobbin.http://ireland.anglican.org/information/dioceses/parish/16980http://www.libraryireland.com/topog/K/Kilgobbin- Corkaguiney-Kerry.php St Gobban and St Scuithin St. Gobban founded his monastery at OldLeighlin in 616. The boundary lines of counties Carlow, Laois and Kilkenny all meet on the castlecomer plateau. A portion of this plateau has often been referred to as Slieve Margy. OldLeighlin sits on the eastern slopes of the Johnswell hills in the south of the plateau in county Carlow. In the 6th century Scuithin left Ireland to become a disciple of the Welsh holy man Saint David, whom he is credited with saving from poisoning.St David of wales;Cult,ChurchandNation.JohnWynDavies,JonathanM.Vooding,p133 On returning home to Ireland he became a hermit and holy man in the Johnswell hills where the memory of his name and abode are preserved in \\"tigh scuithin.\\" While the site of \\"Tigh Scuthin\\" has thankfully been preserved in the eponymous location of Tiscoffin it has unfortunately almost obliterated the memory of St. Scuithin as an actual historical entity. When the ancient tuatha were reorganised Kilkenny was divided into baronies and parishes. The Kilkenny barony of Gowran includes the civil parish of Tiscoffinhttp://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~irlkik/twlnd/parisw.htm (tigh scuithin) which stretches into the Johnswell hills. It seems probable that here, in the 7th century, existed the fluid and fluctuating boundary between the Kingdom of Ossory and that of Leinster in which Old leighlin is situated. Kilkenny would eventually become a county of Leinster in 1210.http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~irlkik/ihm/ireclans.htm The county Kilkenny town of Castlewarren:(Caisleán an Bhairínigh) in the civil parish of Tiscoffin preserves his memory with the Church of Scuithin.http://www.ossory.ie/parishes-and-people/diocesan-database/parish- details/?page=ddb_parish_details&parishID;=6 This church is seven kilometres distant from OldLeighlin. No doubt the ancient abode of St. Gobban of OldLeighlin is on the periphery of Tigh Scuthin – Tiscoffin. Also according to the Journal of the Royal Antiquaries of Ireland (1876) St. Gobban may have briefly aboded at tigh Scuithin. (after leaving OldLeighlin and before Killamery) for at a time unknown a monastery was erected here. Time, linguistic variations, dialects and anglicisation has confused and entangled St Goban and St.Scuithin: however, two distinct historical persons did exist. Vague references to a tascaffin in county Limerick are extant but no designation of that name can be found. However Tiscoffin monastery, county Kilkenny is in the List of monastic houses in Ireland. The Goban Saor. The history of Ireland is steeped in mythology. According to Irish invasions tradition, the fifth group to arrive was the Tuatha Dé Danann. They fought and won many battles and displaced and disposest the Fir Bolg. The Tuatha de Danann had a trinity of gods of craft, the most important of which was Goibniu. Goibnui forged lethal weapons and brewed their magical elixirs of invincibility. His name in Old Irish Gobae~Gobann translates as smith~craftsman. Gobann the craftsman – a skilled builder – the Gobán Saor. St. Gobhan was renowned as a builder-founder of many churches. However, as a founder, he should be acclaimed, for the churches were not lavish, spectacular Romanesque or Gothic cathedrals but simple mud and wattle mixtures that embraced usually the holy well – Christianized to act as the font. The interconnectedness and mutuality of names and professions undoubtedly gave rise to an expression of oneness. The Goban Saor of the Tuatha de Danann existed in an un-dateable period of Ireland's pre-history. St. Gobhan's death is recorded during a dateable period of Ireland's early history. Although St. Gobhan is not the goban saor of the Tuatha de Danann, he could be described as a Goban Saor of 6th–7th century Ireland.

Halifax: Nimbus Publishing and The Nova Scotia Museum. The cliffs, which stretch approximately from Wasson Brook in the east, to Swan Creek in the west, consist of 200-million- year-old rocks that have yielded a wide array of fossils including more than 100,000 bones from Canada's oldest-known dinosaurs as well as the smallest dinosaur tracks ever found.Lessem, Don (1992) Kings of Creation: How a New Breed of Scientists is Revolutionizing Our Understanding of Dinosaurs. New York: Simon and Schuster.Atlantic Geoscience Society (2001)The Last Billion Years: A Geological History of the Maritime Provinces of Canada. Halifax: Nimbus Publishing. The fossils date from a critical time in the evolution of life, the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic geological periods, when mass extinctions led not only to the dominance of the dinosaurs, but also to the evolution of groups of vertebrates, such as fish, crocodiles, frogs and mammals, whose descendants are still alive today. The abrasive action of the tides, considered to be the world's highest, constantly exposes fossils on the cliff faces, shores and seabed.Thurston, Harry (1990) Tidal Life: A Natural History of the Bay of Fundy. Camden East, Ontario: Camden House Publishing. In 1990, Paul E. Olsen, one of the paleontologists who has conducted extensive fossil excavations at Wasson Bluff wrote: \\"Every time I stand before these cliffs, I feel dwarfed by the immensity of time.\\" Geology The cliffs at Wasson Bluff stand at the edge of the ancient rift valley known as the Fundy Basin. It was created when the supercontinent Pangaea began to break up about 225 million years ago. As the continental plates moved apart, they ruptured, and blocks subsided or rose along fault lines creating complex, twisted layers of rock turned at odd angles.Roland, Albert E. (1982)Geological Background and Physiography of Nova Scotia. Halifax: The Nova Scotian Institute of Science. The orange and red sandstones visible at Wasson Bluff formed as rivers swollen by intense rains carried coarse sediments from nearby highlands into the Fundy Basin. Other deposits came from wind-blown sand dunes or from the sediments on the bottoms of shallow lakes that, at various times, occupied the floor of the basin. As Pangea broke apart, magma rose to the surface through deep fissures in the Earth's crust erupting as lava flows. This massive volcanic activity created the greenish-grey columns and grey-black blocks of basalt that form large sections of the cliffs. Fossil discoveries =Tiny dinosaur tracks= World's smallest dinosaur tracks On April 10, 1984, veteran fossil hunter and amateur geologist, Eldon George, made a discovery that drew the world's attention to Wasson Bluff. George was riding along the shoreline on his all-terrain vehicle when he stopped behind an outcropping to take shelter from the wind. As he bent over his ATV to warm his hands, his experienced eye picked out what appeared to be tiny tracks. Using a jackknife, he gradually exposed five fossil trackways imprinted in a slab of sandstone measuring . The three-toed, penny-sized footprints were made by a theropod dinosaur about the size of a robin. They were the smallest dinosaur tracks ever found. Although the tiny dinosaur tracks are Eldon George's most famous discovery, he has made many others in a career that began in the 1940s. His finds include a wide variety of fossilized amphibian and dinosaur prints that are displayed, along with the world's smallest dinosaur tracks, at his Parrsboro Rock and Mineral Shop and Museum. One of them, also found at Wasson Bluff, is a track that may have been made by a primitive, two-legged, crocodile-like creature that was nearly long.Janes, Heather. \\"Important fossil discovery draws thousands to Parrsboro.\\" The Citizen, Nov. 28, 1987. =Rich fossil beds= In January 1986, American paleontologists Paul Olsen and Neil Shubin announced they had recovered hundreds of thousands of bones at Wasson Bluff, the largest fossil find in North America dating from the geological period 200 million years ago known as the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. It was a time when massive lakes of lava spewed from fissures in the earth as the supercontinent Pangea broke apart. Some scientists believe that the volcanic eruptions and the poisonous gases they released caused the mass extinction of nearly half of the world's creatures ending a period dominated by huge reptiles and enabling dinosaurs to become dominant. The sandstone and basalt cliffs at Wasson Bluff were formed during the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. They contain fossil remains of the creatures who lived both before and after the mass extinction. In 1984, Neil Shubin found the jaw of a mammal-like reptile known as a trithelodont, the first such discovery in North America. The next summer he and Paul Olsen, along with Hans-Dieter Sues of the Royal Ontario Museum and William Amaral, Charles Schaff, and Steven Orzack of Harvard University, uncovered 12 complete skulls of trithelodonts, a discovery that has helped scientists gain a better understanding of the origins of mammals. They also retrieved many other fossils including teeth from small, bird-hipped dinosaurs, skulls of lizard- like creatures known as sphenodontids, ancestral crocodile bones and skulls, as well as fossilized fish and shark bones. Restrictions on fossil collection A special permit is required before anyone can collect fossils or use rock hammers in the Wasson Bluff area. The site is protected under Nova Scotia's Special Places Protection Act. The law aims to preserve places that are important for cultural, historical and environmental reasons and that are significant sites for scientific research.

The PlayStation 4 game was released in North America and the PAL region in November 2013 and in Japan in February 2014, while the Vita and PlayStation 3 versions were released in December 2014. Resogun: Heroes, the first downloadable content (DLC), was released in North America on June 24, 2014, while the second DLC, Resogun: Defenders was released on February 17, 2015. Resogun draws heavily from the games Defender and Datastorm, and is considered the spiritual successor to Housemarque's previous shoot 'em up games Super Stardust HD and Super Stardust Delta. In Resogun the player battles enemies and rescues trapped humans in a cylindrical, voxel-based world. The game was well received by video game journalists, who lauded its graphical prowess, fast-paced gameplay, and soundtrack. The game was criticized for its short length and lack of tutorials or explanations for several gameplay elements. Resogun won several awards, and was nominated for Action Game of the Year at the 2014 DICE Awards, and also appeared at the 2014 GDC Choice Awards.  Gameplay  In Resogun, the player battles enemies in a cylindrical, voxel-based world. Here, the player fights off enemies coming from both directions as they wait for the next human to be released. In Resogun, the player battles phases of enemies on five distinct, cylindrical, voxel-based levels: Acis, Ceres, Decima, Febris, and Mefitis. Each level is separated into three phases and includes a unique boss enemy. Although the primary goal of each level is to eliminate all enemies, including the boss, humans can be saved in order to gain a bonus score towards the player's final score. In order to save a human, it must first be released from its chamber by killing a set of \\"keepers.\\" Upon release, the player can pick up the human and bring it to one of two safety points. Three ships (Nemesis, Ferox, and Phobos) are available for selection; each ship has different levels of agility, boost, and overdrive. In addition, various upgrades and powerups are available to the player throughout each level. Overdrive, once charged, produces a powerful beam of energy that is capable of taking out large quantities of enemies. Boost acts as a speed boost and allows the player to escape from enemies, as well as destroy enemies by colliding with them. The nova-bomb produces a large explosion that clears all enemies currently on the level. These are limited in quantity but can be obtained through pickups. Ship upgrades and extra lives can also be obtained through pickups, or by saving humans. You can also choose from a selection of custom made skins for your ship made by other people online. Upon completion of each level, the player will receive a bonus score. The amount of bonus score depends on various factors, including the number of humans saved and the number of nova-bombs preserved, to name a few. In addition, the game features two game modes: Single Level and Arcade. In Single Level mode, the player selects one single level and attempts to complete that level for a single high score. In Arcade Mode, however, the player continues to the next level after the successful completion of each level. Difficulties include Rookie, Experienced, Veteran, Master, and Hero.  Development and release  Resogun was heavily inspired by the classic arcade game Defender. Resogun was developed by Housemarque, an independent game development studio from Finland known for its previous shoot 'em up games, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. Resogun draws heavy inspiration from the games Defender and Datastorm, and acts as the spiritual successor to Housemarque's most recent Super Stardust games (Super Stardust HD and Super Stardust Delta), from which it directly borrows certain gameplay mechanics like the boost power-up. Harry Krueger, the lead programmer of Resogun, expanded on the inspiration for the game in an interview with S2P Magazine, explaining that \\"on the one hand, you have the classic shoot-and-survive gameplay of shoot 'em ups ... but there was this extra layer of gameplay there with micromanaging and saving the humans.\\" Despite being a launch title, Resogun makes extensive use of the PlayStation 4's hardware, with each level being built by nearly 200 million voxels. Housemarque CEO Ilari Kuittinen stated that \\"we wanted to create a world which can break down into tiny pieces, so voxels were one of the options to use.\\" The game went through several stylistic changes through development, partly due to Housemarque's initial uncertainty of the graphical capabilities of the PlayStation 4. In the end, the developers struggled more with \\"how 'retro' the game had to look\\", going through several stages (including a colorful style reminiscent of games like Minecraft and Parodius) until they settled with the neon aesthetic of the game. Certain render-heavy visual effects were cut, however, to avoid placing too many fast-moving objects on the screen and to prevent visual clutter. Many Housemarque developers have remarked that the PlayStation 4 was easier to develop for than the PlayStation 3, which played a role in creating the GPU-intensive levels of Resogun. Tommaso De Benetti, community manager at Housemarque, explained that many PlayStation 3 features were initially poorly documented, and that \\"we [didn't] have to spend an afternoon reverse engineering basic features\\" during the development of Resogun. Resogun was released in North America on November 15, 2013, in Europe on November 29, 2013, and in Japan on February 22, 2014 exclusively for the PlayStation 4 as one of two free titles offered to PlayStation Plus members. Resogun was completed mere days before its release in North America, due to last-minute tweaks and polishing by the developers. Prior to its release, a demo version of the game was playable at the Sony PlayStation booth at Gamescom 2013 and at the Eurogamer Expo in London. On June 24, 2014, the first Resogun DLC, Resogun: Heroes, was released, featuring a new game world, two new game modes, a new and improved leaderboard, and new trophies. The second DLC, Resogun: Defenders was released on February 17, 2015. The expansion includes 2 new modes, namely Protector mode and Commando mode. Several smaller DLC was also released, which includes additional skins for the ships and the humans. The official soundtrack was released on June 9, 2015. All the additional content is free for owners of the Season Pass.  Reception  Resogun received a generally positive response from critics upon release. Ben Kuchera, writing for The Penny Arcade Report, declared Resogun as \\"the best PlayStation 4 launch game\\". GameRankings, an aggregator for video game reviews, assigned the game a score of 85% based on 38 reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the game received an average score of 84 based on 66 reviews. Brian Albert of IGN gave Resogun a score of 9.0/10, praising the fast-paced, lagless gameplay, the energetic music, and the co-op experience, but insisted that several boss fights were not challenging enough. Peter Brown of GameSpot also praised the music, as well as the use of voxels, explaining that the \\"accompanying beat of the techno-laden soundtrack and the constant trickle of voxels are mesmerizing.\\" Brad Shoemaker of Giant Bomb described Resogun as \\"a real audio-visual treat\\", also praising the graphics and sound. Edge magazine gave Resogun a score of 8/10, praising Housemarque's use of voxels: \\"despite the modest expectations players might have ... Housemarque never wants you to forget that Resogun is running on new tech.\\" Christian Donlan of Eurogamer praised Resogun's gameplay elements and challenge, such as the need for the player to be aware of their surroundings in order to do well. David Jenkins of GameCentral also praised the gameplay, but criticized the game's length, explaining that the game was too short. Jenkins was also unimpressed with the graphics, as well as the visuals: \\"the backdrops in particular are very disappointing as all the new stages look almost identical, just with a slightly different kind of fortress-like structure in the middle.\\" Eric L. Patterson of EGM gave Resogun a score of 9.0/10, describing it as \\"another expertly produced retro-inspired shooter from Housemarque.\\" McKinley Noble of GamesBeat gave Resogun a score of 65/100, praising it for its graphics and challenging gameplay, but criticizing it for its lack of clarity with regard to gameplay elements; in particular, the lack of any kind of tutorial level or \\"training wheels\\". Noble expanded on this by explaining that \\"some players might get bewildered when trying to figure out their weapons and when to use them, and the audio cues aren’t obvious enough to be helpful.\\" Noble also criticized the game's lack of appeal to players who wanted to \\"blitz through tons of levels\\" and \\"unlock extra ships\\", stating that \\"you won’t find much content past what's offered upfront.\\" Kyle Hilliard of Game Informer gave Resogun a score of 8/10, criticizing the graphics as \\"doing little to showcase the next generation\\", as well as the sound, which he described as \\"forgettable-yet-appropriate\\". Hilliard praised the game for its controls, however, as well as the accessible and fun nature of the gameplay. The game won several awards, and was nominated for Action Game of the Year at the 2014 DICE Awards in addition to appearing at the 2014 GDC Choice Awards.

Life Abadula Gemeda was born Minase Woldegiorgis in Arsi Zone, Oromia Region, on 5 July 1958. The name Abadula Gemeda is a pseudonym or 'nom de guerre' he obtained at some point during his life. Abbaa Duulaa is the traditional title of the war leader of the Oromo people, an aristocratic horse name. Abadula has a mix of military and civilian education. His military education was obtained from the Defense University of China in Military Leadership in 1995. His civilian education was focused on public administration. His Bachelor and Master's of Arts degrees from the US were both obtained from Century University in 2001 and 2004, respectively. Abadula also obtained his master's degree from Greenwich University, UK, in 2009. Political career With the change in government in 1991, Abadula became the chief of operations of the National Defense Force. After five years of service, he became the chief of intelligence in 1996. He was appointed as commander of the ground force of the National Defense Force in 1998. He reached the rank of Major General. In 2000 he was appointed as Minister of National Defense. Moving to a civilian profile, Abadula became President of the Oromia Region in 2005. Abadula is considered one of the few influential politicians within the OPDO. In 2010 he became Speaker of the House of Representatives. He resigned on 7 October 2017; the Addis Standard reported that it was in protest of Federal government’s handling of clashes surrounding the boundary dispute between the Oromo and Somali regions. However he later withdrew his resignation after consultations in this government, remaining in office until April 2018 when he was replaced by Muferiat Kamil. Immediately thereafter he was appointed National Security Advisor. His tenure was however short-lived; he was \\"honourably retired\\" in June 2018 less than two months after being named to the post.

The output work of the engine is driven by this cam. Cam engines have been a success. The first engine to get an airworthiness certificate from the United States government was, in fact, a radial cam engine. A variation of the cam engine, the swashplate engine (also the closely related wobble-plate engine), was briefly popular. These are generally thought of as internal combustion engines, although they have also been used as hydraulic- and pneumatic motors. Hydraulic motors, particularly the swashplate form, are widely and successfully used. Internal combustion engines, though, remain almost unknown.  Operation  =Operating cycle= Some cam engines are two-stroke engines, rather than four-stroke. Two modern example are the KamTech and Earthstar, both radial-cam engines. In a two-stroke engine, the forces on the piston act uniformly downwards, throughout the cycle. In a four- stroke engine, these forces reverse cyclically: In the induction phase, the piston is forced upwards, against the reduced induction depression. The simple cam mechanism only works with a force in one direction. In the first Michel engines, the cam had two surfaces, a main surface on which the pistons worked when running and another ring inside this that gave a desmodromic action to constrain the piston position during engine startup. Usually, only one cam is required, even for multiple cylinders. Most cam engines were thus opposed twin or radial engines. An early version of the Michel engine was a rotary engine, a form of radial engine where the cylinders rotate around a fixed crank.  Advantages  # Perfect balance, a crank system is impossible to dynamically balance, because one cannot attenuate a reciprocal force or action with a rotary reaction or force. The modern KamTech cam engine uses another piston to attenuate the reciprocal forces. It runs as smoothly as an electric motor. # A more ideal combustion dynamic, a look at a PV diagram of the \\"ideal IC engine\\" and one will find that the combustion event ideally should be a more-or-less \\"constant volume event\\".Ideal Otto Cycle The short dwell time that a crank produces does not provide a more-or-less constant volume for the combustion event to take place in. A crank system reaches significant mechanical advantage at 6° before TDC; it then reaches maximum advantage at 45° to 50°. This limits the burn time to less than 60°. Also, the quickly descending piston lowers the pressure ahead of the flame front, reducing the burn time. This means less time to burn under lower pressure. This dynamic is why in all crank engines a significant amount of the fuel is burned not above the piston, where its power can be extracted, but in the catalytic converter, which only produces heat. A modern cam can be manufactured with computer numerical control (CNC) technology so as to have a delayed mechanical advantage. The KamTech cam, for example, reaches significant advantage at 20°, permitting the ignition to start sooner in the rotation, and maximum advantage is moved to 90°, permitting a longer burn time before the exhaust is vented. This means the burn under high pressure takes place during 110° with a cam, rather than 60°, as happens when a crank is used. Therefore, the KamTech engine at any speed and under any load never has fire coming out of the exhaust, because there is time for full and complete combustion to take place under high pressure above the piston.Requires Linkedin login A few other advantages of modern cam engines: * Ideal piston dynamics * Lower internal friction * Cleaner exhaust * Lower fuel consumption * Longer life * More power per kilogram * Compact, modular design permits better vehicle design * Fewer parts, cost less to make To suggest that cam engines were or are a failure when robustness is concerned is in error. After extensive testing by the United States government, the Fairchild Model 447-C radial-cam engine had the distinction of receiving the very first Department of Commerce Approved Type Certificate. At a time when aircraft crank engine had a life of 30 to 50 hours, the Model 447-C was far more robust than any other aircraft engine then in production.Fairchild (Ranger) Sadly, in this pre-CNC age it had a very poor cam profile, which meant it shook too severely for the wood propellers and the wood, wire, and cloth airframes of the time. = Bearing area = One advantage is that the bearing surface area can be larger than for a crankshaft. In the early days of bearing material development, the reduced bearing pressure this allowed could give better reliability. A relatively successful swashplate cam engine was developed by the bearing expert George Michell, who also developed the slipper-pad thrust block. The Michel engine (no relation) began with roller cam followers, but switched during development to plain bearing followers. = Effective gearing = Unlike a crankshaft, a cam may easily have more than one throw per rotation. This allows more than one piston stroke per revolution. For aircraft use, this was an alternative to using a propeller speed reduction unit: high engine speed for an improved power-to-weight ratio, combined with a slower propeller speed for an efficient propeller. In practice, the cam engine design weighed more than the combination of a conventional engine and gearbox.  Swashplate and wobble plate engines  The only internal combustion cam engines that have been remotely successful were the swashplate engines. These were almost all axial engines, where the cylinders are arranged parallel to the engine axis, in one or two rings. The purpose of such engines was usually to achieve this axial or \\"barrel\\" layout, making an engine with a very compact frontal area. There were plans at one time to use barrel engines as aircraft engines, with their reduced frontal area allowing a smaller fuselage and lower drag. A similar engine to the swashplate engine is the wobble plate engine, also known as nutator or Z-crank drive. This uses a bearing that purely nutates, rather than also rotating as for the swashplate. The wobble plate is separated from the output shaft by a rotary bearing. Wobble plate engines are thus not cam engines.  Pistonless rotary engines  Some engines use cams, but are not \\"cam engines\\" in the sense described here. These are a form of pistonless rotary engine. Since the time of James Watt, inventors have sought a rotary engine that relied on purely rotating movement, without the reciprocating movement and balance problems of the piston engine. These engines don't work either.With the occasional, and usually tenuous, exception of the Wankel engine. This is however a pistonless rotary engine without being a cam engine. Most pistonless engines relying on cams, such as the Rand cam engine, use the cam mechanism to control the motion of sealing vanes. Combustion pressure against these vanes causes a vane carrier, separate from the cam, to rotate. In the Rand engine, the camshaft moves the vanes so that they have a varying length exposed and so enclose a combustion chamber of varying volume as the engine rotates. The work done in rotating the engine to cause this expansion is the thermodynamic work done by the engine and what causes the engine to rotate.

Early life and career Alemayehu was born on 12 February 1969 in the village of Sere in Welega Province, now in Bonaya Boshe District in the Misraq Welega Zone of the Oromia Region. Alemayehu attended school close to his home district at Gubo Leyo Primary School and Siri Secondary School.http://hornaffairs.com/en/2014/03/09/profile- ethiopia-oromia-alemayehu-atomsa/ During the Ethiopian Civil War, he was conscripted by the government to fight against EPLF and TPLF rebels. He, however, was captured by TPLF rebels. Not too long, his capturers gave him the option of continuing to be their POW or becoming a founding member of the Oromo People's Democratic Organization (OPDO); he chose the later. He received a law degree from the Ethiopian Civil Service University and a Master of Public Policy degree from Peking University in Beijing, China. Alemayehu started his career as a teacher. He rose to become the Director of the Information Agency of the Oromia Region, and then managing director of the Ethiopian Radio and Television Agency. Alemayehu joined the armed struggle against the military junta of President Mengistu Hailemariam in 1989. He had been part of the leadership of OPDO and EPRDF since the ouster of the military junta in 1991; among others, as head of Oromia’s eastern Wolega zone and head of Oromia’s western Wolega zone. Alemayehu served as Oromia’s chief of security, as head of OPDO’s political department and as head of OPDO’s headquarters from 1996 to 2002. He was head of Oromia’s Communications Bureau, then Director General of Ethiopian Radio and Television Agency from 2006 to 2010. In 2012, Alemayehu became Chairperson of OPDO and President of Oromia region. He was the father of two daughters and two son. Presidency of the Oromia Region Alemayehu, an \\"obscure figure with little connection to the OPDO’s rank and file\\" became president of the Oromia Region on 6 September 2010, succeeding former General Abadula Gemeda, who was elected to the Federal Parliamentary Assembly and became the Speaker of the House of Peoples' Representatives. \\"Hailed [for] his strength and leadership charisma\\", as president, Alemayehu took a strong, public, and controversial stance against corruption, and within months of his assuming office several public officials had been arrested for bribery, nepotism, and other acts of corruption. Under his presidency, the Addis Ababa - Adama Expressway, the country's first modern motorway, was built to connect the capital city of Addis Ababa to the city of Adama, the largest city and de facto capital of the Oromia Region. However, within months of taking office, he fell severely ill due to food poisoning, and remained so throughout his tenure. Thus for much of his tenure, he was abroad seeking medical treatment, and by 2013 he had \\"virtually withdrawn from public life\\" as a result. In 2012, he tendered his resignation to then-Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, but it was rejected, as were several other requests, before his resignation was finally accepted on 17 February 2014. Illness and death Alemayehu died of food poisoning on 6 March 2014 at the Bumrungrad International Hospital in Bangkok, at 1AM in the morning, having received treatment for the five weeks prior. Some opposition sources has suggested that foul play was at hand in his death, as his anti-corruption campaign threatened existing political figures. At a memorial service at Holy Trinity Cathedral, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn said that Alemayehu had been \\"a fighter and a comrade who worked tirelessly till the end for the people of Oromia and Ethiopia.\\" Flags around the country flew for three days at half-mast.

She has been painting for over 40 years and is known for portraits of New York celebrities and colorful works based on Asian Buddha’s and deities created with silkscreen on canvas done in a manner influenced by her friend Andy Warhol. Her paintings have been shown at Tibet House US, Patterson Museum of Contemporary Art and The New England Museum of Contemporary Art. Early life Hedy Klineman grew up in Williamsburg Brooklyn. After attending F.I.T and Pratt Institute, she graduated from Cooper Union in 1962 where she came under the influence of the Abstract Expressionists such as Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline. After working for Charles Jourdan shoes and creating their American division, she focused on painting in the 1970s. Art During the 1970s, Hedy Klineman painted brushy abstractions and splashy Color Field drip paintings influenced by Hans Hofmann, Helen Frankenthaler and Larry Poons. 1980s Klineman developed, in the early 1980s, a very personal style of portraiture called “Fashion Portraits.” She became known as a chronicler of the downtown art scene and of uptown socialite personalities, using an unusual collage-assemblage technique. Sitters were asked to contribute pieces of clothing that represented them. Then Klineman would adhere the clothing to the canvas along with painted elements and objects to create a mixed media portrait. Andy Warhol donated a pair of glasses, Henry Geldzahler gave her a hat and Julian Schnabel gave her the clothes he painted in. Keith Haring, Mary McFadden, Bret Easton Ellis, Larry Rivers, Betsey Johnson and Jane Holzer all donated items that were used in their portraits. These were shown at Harm Bouckaert Gallery in 1984 and Sensory Evolution Gallery in 1986. During this period, she also painted day glow nudes and figures. Latter in the 1980s as the Cold War ended, she turned to political content using silkscreened newspaper images of current events. These were shown at Rempire Gallery in Soho in 1991 along with some of the first Buddhas. 1990s In the 1990s Klineman embarked on a spiritual journey studying meditation and yoga. She then began using deities from India, China and Indonesia. Using multiple silk- screens, Klineman overlapped Hindu and Buddhist imagery over textured backgrounds that sometimes included gold leaf. A major show of this work was held at Bridgewater Lustberg Gallery in 1996. 2000s Pool Buddha 72\\" x 56\\" Acrylic Silkscreen on Canvas 2011 Through the 2000s Klineman focused on the Buddha as subject matter and produced series of large multi paneled silkscreen paintings where the Buddha is repeated in bright Pop colors called “Buddha’s in the Garden.” Concurrently she continued to make hand painted Buddha’s, still lives, landscapes and abstracts. Currently Recently Klineman has continued portrait painting with a series called “African American Portraits” depicting prominent African Americans using African masks in silkscreen collage. Some of her subjects are Russell Simmons, Mary Schmidt Campbell and Jessye Norman. Paintings from this series were exhibited at Benrimon Contemporary in 2012.

Trial operations were begun on 1 February 2015, with several months of testing following that. It is operated by the Shenzhen Metro Group. Overview Mexico Square) Urael Station Light Rail vehicle Of the two line rail lines, the east-west line extends , stretching from Ayat Village to Torhailoch, and passing through Megenagna, Meskel Square, Legehar and Mexico Square. The north-south line, which is in length, passes through Menelik II Square, Merkato, Lideta, Legehar, Meskel Square, Gotera and Kaliti. However, two lines have a common track of about 2.7 km. The common track is the elevated section which runs east to west across the southern edge of the CBD from Meskel Square to Mexico Square, and onwards to Lideta. Trains on the north south line are blue and white, whilst on the east west line they are green and white. The Fares cost 2-6 Ethiopian birr. Tickets are bought at orange coloured kiosks next to each station. The final cost to build the railway was US$475m, with construction taking three years. The Addis Ababa Light Rail was originally to have a total of 41 stations on its two lines, and each train was planned have a capacity to carry 286 passengers. This will enable the light rail transit to provide a transportation service to 15,000 passengers per hour per direction (PPHPD) and 60,000 in all four directions. The railway lines have their own dedicated power grid. According to CREC the system carried on average 113,500 daily passengers in January 2016 with 153,000 passengers as highest passenger load during a single day. Service frequency was 10 minutes during peak hours on both lines and 20 minutes during off-peak hours. On average there were 94 train rotations on the Blue line (3,177.2 vehicle-kilometres) and 93 rotations on the Green line (3,236.4 vehicle-kilometres).China Railway NO.2 Engineering Group Co., Ltd  Future expansion  There are future plans for extensions in all four directions. According to Getachew Betru, CEO of Ethiopian Railways Corporation, the Ethiopian government indicated that any new line built should be completely grade-separated. Apart from extending the existing lines, two new lines are under consideration by the Ethiopian government. The first one will start at St. George's Cathedral, pass along Mexico Square to the African Union Headquarters and will terminate at Lebu, connecting to the new national rail network. The second line will start at Megenagna Roundabout and passes via Bole Airport, Wello Sefer area, Saris market area and Jommo area and terminates at Lebu.

Gameplay The game's art direction follows the style of Edward Gorey. The titular character, known only as \\"Baby\\", is a young girl with an upside-down face. She carries a heart-shaped balloon, as do the other characters that Baby encounters throughout the adventure. Popping the other characters' balloons (via a tap on the Vita's touch screen) unlocks additional powers via different level backdrops. Up to three additional backdrops are unlocked on each level, and can be swapped at any time via a swipe of the Vita's rear touchpad. Many of the game's puzzles require quick shifting between various backdrops/powers in order to proceed. The game world is a world populated by children's fantasies and fears. Using the Vita touch screen, the player must guide Baby through the world by \\"holding\\" her hand and guiding her throughout the game.http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2013/08/20/murasaki-baby-unveiled-for-ps- vita/ Reception Metacritic, a review aggregator, rated the game 69/100 based on 48 reviews.

The game was released for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita with cross-play, on March 3, 2015 in North America and on March 4, 2015 in Europe, respectively. A version for Microsoft Windows was also released via Steam on December 7, 2015. It features couch or online co-op, or a combination of both, for up to four players. Helldivers takes inspiration from military science fiction such as Aliens and Starship Troopers. While solo play is possible, the intent is for two to four players to cooperate on missions to enemy-controlled planets. Almost every weapon or tool accessible to players can hurt their teammates, making discipline and coordination paramount. Gameplay In Helldivers, the players need to learn to coordinate their actions during chaotic combat, to complete objectives and to avoid friendly-fire casualties. The game is set in a procedurally generated universe where the community must fight three different enemy species to ensure the survival of Super Earth. Gameplay takes place on procedurally-generated missions where players must accomplish a series of objectives. Unlike many similar games where fighting certain enemies in a certain order is mandatory, the players make their own decisions about where to drop, whether to go on foot or in vehicles, in what order objectives should be completed and when to call down certain pieces of equipment, referred to as stratagems within the game. Before missions, the players select from a wide variety of weapons and equipment; some strategems drop a cargo pod containing heavy weapons or vehicles to be operated by players, while others consist of orbital strikes, airdropped minefields or other support firepower. To win, players must fight or sneak through enemy-controlled territory, complete objectives, and call a dropship to extract them from the planet. Outside of certain trophies/achievements, there are no rewards granted for simply killing enemies, which are endless. It is possible to hold out indefinitely against waves of defenders, calling in more and more ammunition and defenses and racking up huge kill counts, without making the slightest progress toward winning the mission. When the game was shown during Gamescom 2013 the game's difficulty included three levels: Challenging, Hard, or \\"Hell Dive\\". The build presented at E3 2014 and Gamescom 2014 however indicated there to be more than nine difficulties, depending on which planet the player chose. The final game does indeed feature one global difficulty level within which the player can choose an easy or hard planet. Once on the planet's surface, players follow an escalating pattern. Weak enemy patrols crisscross the planet semi-randomly, keeping watch on objectives. Players can see nearby patrols on the radar, try to avoid them, or kill them before discovery. If they spot the player, they will quickly sound an alarm, calling in front-line troops to fight the players and interfere with completing objectives. Endless troops can pour in forever if the players continue to set off alerts. If the player can kill or escape from the responders without new alarms going off, the map will quiet down, giving players an opportunity to advance without resistance until the next alarm goes off. When all objectives are completed or failed, the players call the dropship. It takes 90 seconds to arrive, and during that time, hostiles are strongly attracted to the landing zone for a final fight. Entering the dropship completes the mission. =Multiplayer= As with Arrowhead Game Studios's previous title Magicka friendly fire, the ability to harm teammates, is always on, and there is no way to disable the feature. Not only can players' personal weapons harm teammates, but so can air support and turrets they deploy. Players' thoughtlessly deployed vehicles and supply drops can also crush themselves or teammates. This requires the players to carefully plan their actions during the game's many chaotic combat sequences. There are ways to work around friendly fire: some weapons can launch over teammates' heads, and some turrets can be upgraded to stop shooting when players enter the line of fire. But player skill is still the main solution. The opportunity for teamwork is also present in other areas. Teammates can be helped up if downed, healed if injured, resupplied if out of ammo. Several heavy weapons come with a backpack that allows a second player to help reload; there are also ammo packs for carrying normal magazines and grenades for the group to access. Players use the Reinforce strategem to call in respawns for killed teammates. While online, an SOS beacon is available to invite random players to join a mission in progress, although games can also be set to private. Plot The dystopian universe of Helldivers has mankind ruled by a 'managed democracy', an improvement of contemporary democracy where the outcome of elections are more predictable. The improved democracy has become more than a way of electing a government, it has become a creed by which the brainwashed inhabitants of Super Earth fight for - without fully acknowledging what it means. Super Earth, the fictional futuristic Earth is beset on all sides by three hostile enemy races (the Bugs, the Cyborgs and the Illuminates) that, according to the government, in one way or another needs to be subdued. And while the Helldivers are a pure combat unit, they are often tasked with retrieving technology, activating oil-pumps or other activity that is deemed important by the government to preserve freedom and the Earth 'way of life'. Reception The game received generally favourable reviews from critics. It currently holds 84% on Metacritic. IGN played the demo version of Helldivers at the 2013 Gamescom, and reviewed the demo positively. Game Informer also gave the demo a positive rating, commenting that it \\"isn't easy, but this throwback to classic top down shooters is still a good time.\\" GameSpot's reviewer Cameron Woolsey gave the game an 8/10. He noted that the game has \\"fantastic cooperative action\\" but \\"missions and story are lacking.\\" IGN awarded it 9.0 out of 10, saying \\"Brutal, focused, and mechanically rich, Helldivers is one of the best co-op action experiences you can have.\\"http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/03/14/helldivers-review In a review- based web series Previously Recorded, Rich Evans described the game as \\"stratem-up\\": Helldivers was nominated for \\"Best Action\\" and won \\"Best Handheld Game of the Year\\" at the 2016 D.I.C.E.

Hoping to gain both plunder and a vassal state, Mongol leader Genghis Khan commanded some initial raids against Western Xia before launching a full-scale invasion in 1209. This marked both the first major invasion conducted by Genghis and the first major Mongol invasion of China. After a nearly year-long siege of the capital, Yinchuan, although the diverted river accidentally flooded the Mongol camp, the Tangut emperor Li Anquan surrendered in January 1210. For nearly a decade the Western Xia served the Mongols as vassals and aided them in the Mongol–Jin War, but when Genghis invaded the Islamic Khwarazmian dynasty in 1219, Western Xia attempted to break away from the Empire and ally with the Jin and Song dynasties. Angered by this betrayal, in 1225 Genghis Khan sent a second, punitive expedition into Western Xia. Genghis intended to annihilate the entire Western Xia culture, and his campaign systematically destroyed Western Xia cities and the countryside, culminating in the siege of the capital in 1227 along with forays into Jin territory. Near the end of the siege, in August 1227, Genghis Khan died from an uncertain cause, though some accounts say he was killed in action against Western Xia. After his death, Yinchuan fell to the Mongols and most of its population was massacred.  Background  The Western Xia dynasty, also called Xi-Xia, the Tangut Empire, or Minya, emerged in 1038, and eventually covered what are now the northwestern Chinese provinces of Ningxia, Gansu, eastern Qinghai, northern Shaanxi, northeastern Xinjiang, southwest Inner Mongolia, and southernmost Outer Mongolia.Wang 1993Bian 2005 A fairly small state, Western Xia struggled against its larger and more powerful neighbors, the Liao dynasty to the east and northeast, and the Song dynasty to the southeast. When the Jin dynasty emerged in 1115 and displaced the Liao, Western Xia eventually accepted vassal status to the new Jin empire. Aiding Jin in their wars against the Song, Western Xia gained thousands of square miles of former Song territory. However, over many years the relations between Western Xia and Jin gradually declined. Upon the death of its fourth ruler, Emperor Renzong, Emperor Huanzong took the throne and Western Xia's power began to fail. Though militarily inferior to the neighboring Jin, the Western Xia still exerted a significant influence upon the northern steppes. The state often welcomed deposed Kerait leaders because of close trade connections to the steppes and because of the possibility of using the refugees as pawns in the Mongolian Plateau.May 2012, pg. 1211 In the late 1190s and early 1200s, Temujin, soon to be Genghis Khan, began consolidating his power in Mongolia. Following the death of the Keraites leader Ong Khan to Temujin's emerging Mongol Empire in 1203, Keriat leader Nilqa Senggum led a small band of followers into Western Xia. However, after his adherents took to plundering the locals, Nilqa Senggum was expelled from Western Xia territory.  Preliminary raids  Using his rival Nilga Senggum's temporary refuge in Western Xia as a pretext, Temujin launched a raid against the state in 1205 in the Edsin region.Atwood, pg. 590de Hartog 2004, pg. 59 The Mongols plundered border settlements and one local Western Xia noble accepted Mongol supremacy.Bor, pg. 204 During a raid on Ganzhou (present-day Zhangye), the Mongols captured the son of the city's commander.Man 2004, pg. 212 This young boy joined Mongol service and took a Mongol name, Chagaan, and eventually rose through the ranks to become commander of Temujin's personal guard.Man 2004, pg. 213 The next year, 1206, Temujin was formally proclaimed Genghis Khan, ruler of all the Mongols, marking the official start of the Mongol Empire, while Li Anquan killed Huanzong of Western Xia in a coup d'état and installed himself as Emperor Xiangzong. In 1207, Genghis led another raid into Western Xia, invading the Ordo region and sacking Wuhai, the main garrison along the Yellow River, before withdrawing in 1208.Rossabi 2009, pg. 156 Genghis then began preparing for a full-scale invasion. By invading Western Xia, he would gain a tribute-paying vassal, and also would take control of caravan routes along the Silk Road and provide the Mongols with valuable revenue.Kohn 2007, pg. 205 Furthermore, from Western Xia he could launch raids into the even more wealthy Jin dynasty.Man 2004, pg. 130  First invasion  Mongol invasion of Western Xia in 1209 In 1209, Genghis undertook his campaign to actually conquer Western Xia. Li Anquan requested aid from the Jin dynasty, but the new Jin emperor Wanyan Yongji refused to send aid, stating that \\"It is to our advantage when our enemies attack each other. Wherein lies the danger to us?\\"Man 2004, pg.131. After defeating a force led by Kao Liang-Hui outside Wulahai, Genghis captured the city and pushed up along the Yellow River, defeating several cities as he went, until he reached the fortress Kiemen which guarded the only pass through the Helan Mountains to the capital, Yinchuan.Man 2004, pg. 131Peers 2006, pg. 135 Containing an army of up to 70,000, plus 50,000 reinforcements, the fortress proved too difficult to capture, and after a two-month stand-off the Mongols feinted a retreat, luring the garrison, led by Wei-ming Ling-kung, out onto the field where it was easily destroyed. His path now open, Genghis advanced to the capital. Well fortified, Yinchuan held about 150,000 soldiers, nearly twice the size of the Mongol army.Weatherford, pg. 85 One of their first endeavors at siege warfare, the Mongols lacked the proper equipment and experience to take the city. They arrived at the city in May, but by October were still unsuccessful at breaking through. Genghis attempted to flood the capital by diverting the river and its network of irrigation canals into the city, and by January 1210 the walls of Yinchuan were nearly breached. However, the dike used to divert the river broke, and the ensuing flood wiped out the Mongol camp, forcing the Mongols to take higher ground. Despite this setback, the Mongols still posed a threat to Western Xia, and with the state's crops destroyed and no relief coming from the Jin, Li Anquan agreed to submit to Mongol rule, demonstrating his loyalty by giving a daughter, Chaka, in marriage to Genghis and paying a tribute of camels, falcons, and textiles.Man 2004, pg. 133  Western Xia as a Mongol vassal  In 1210, Western Xia attacked the Jin dynasty as punishment for their refusal to aid them against the Mongols.Kessler 2012, pg. 91 The following year, the Mongols joined Western Xia and began a 23-year-long campaign against Jin. The same year Li Anquan abdicated the throne, and subsequently died, after Shenzong seized power. However, despite aiding the Mongols against Jin, in 1217 when Genghis Khan requested help for his Central Asian campaigns, Western Xia refused to commit troops, and as a warning the Mongols besieged the capital before withdrawing.Dunnell 1996, pg. xxvSinor, Shimin, Kychanov 1998, pg. 213 In 1219, Genghis Khan launched his campaign against the Khwarazmian dynasty in Central Asia, and requested military aid from Western Xia. However, the emperor and his military commander Asha refused to take part in the campaign, stating that if Genghis had too few troops to attack Khwarazm, then he had no claim to supreme power.Man 2004, pg. 160 Infuriated, Genghis swore vengeance and left to invade Khwarazm, while Western Xia attempted alliances with the Jin and Song dynasties against the Mongols.Ebrey 2012, pg. 199  Second invasion  Mongol invasion of Western Xia, 1226-1227 After defeating Khwarazm in 1221, Genghis prepared his armies to punish Western Xia for their betrayal. Meanwhile, Emperor Shenzong stepped down from power in 1223, leaving his son, Xianzong, in his place. In 1225, Genghis Khan attacked with a force of approximately 180,000.Emmons 2012, pg. 139 After taking Khara-Khoto, the Mongols began a steady advance southward. Asha, commander of the Western Xia troops, could not afford to meet the Mongols as it would involve an exhausting westward march from the capital Yinchuan through 500 kilometers of desert. With no army to meet them in pitched battle, the Mongols picked the best targets for attack and as each city fell the Mongols would draw on prisoners, defectors, supplies, and weapons to take the next one. Enraged by Western Xia's fierce resistance, Genghis engaged the countryside in annihilative warfare and ordered his generals to systematically destroy cities and garrisons as they went.Mote 1999, pp. 255–256 Two months after taking Khara- Khoto, the Mongols reached a point where the Qilian Mountains force the Etsin River eastward, about 300 kilometers south of Khara-Khoto. At this point, Genghis divided his army, sending general Subutai to take care of the westernmost cities, while the main force moved east into the heart of the Western Xia Empire. Genghis lay siege to Suzhou, which fell after five weeks. Genghis then moved to Ganzhou, the hometown of his general Chagaan.Man 2004, pp. 212–213 Chagaan's father still commanded the city garrison, so Chagaan attempted negotiations with him. However, the second-in-command of the city staged a coup, killed Chagaan's father, and refused to surrender. The city took five months to subdue, and though the now furious Genghis threatened vengeance, Chagaan convinced him to only kill the 35 conspirators who killed Chagaan's father.Hartog 2004, pg. 134 In August 1226, Genghis escaped the heat by residing in the Qilian Mountains while his troops approached Wuwei, the second-largest city of the Western Xia empire. As no relief came from the capital, Wuwei decided to surrender and avoid certain destruction. At this point, Emperor Xianzong died, leaving Mozhu to deal with a collapsing state as the Mongols encroached on the capital.Man 2004, pg. 214 In Autumn, Genghis rejoined his troops, took Liangchow, crossed the Helan Shan desert, and in November lay siege to Lingwu, a mere 30 kilometers from Yinchuan. Here, in the Battle of Yellow River, Western Xia led a counter-attack with an estimated force of over 300,000 troops, engaging Mongol forces along the banks of the frozen river and canal systems.Tucker 2010, pg. 276 The Mongols destroyed the Western Xia troops, supposedly counting 300,000 bodies of Western Xia soldiers after the battle. Upon reaching Yinchuan in 1227 and setting siege to the city, Genghis prepared to invade the Jin dynasty in order to neutralize any threat of them sending relief troops to Western Xia as well as setting the stage for a final conquest of the Jin empire. Genghis sent a force under his son Ogedai and commander Chagaan toward the southern border, and they pushed into Jin territories along the Wei River and south Shaanxi, even sending some troops over the Qin Mountains to threaten Kaifeng, the Jin capital.de Hartog 2004, pg. 135 Genghis himself rejoined with Subedai and headed southwest to slice across an approximately 150 kilometer-wide territory mainly in present- day Ningxia and Gansu.Man 2004, pg. 215 Subedai crossed the northern parts of the Liupan mountain range, zigzagging from town to town throughout February and March, and conquered the Tao River valley and Lanzhou region.Man 2004, pp. 215, 217 Meanwhile, Genghis went due south, following the Qing Shui river. Back in Western Xia, Yinchuan lay besieged for about six months, and Genghis, himself busy directing a siege of Longde, sent Chagaan to negotiate terms.Man 2004, pg. 219 Chagaan reported that the emperor agreed to capitulate, but wanted a month to prepare suitable gifts. Genghis agreed, though secretly planned to kill the emperor. During the peace negotiations, Genghis continued his military operations around the Liupan mountains near Guyuan, rejected an offer of peace from the Jin, and prepared to invade them near their border with the Song.Man 2004, pg. 219–220de Hartog 2004, pg. 137 However, in August 1227, Genghis died of a historically uncertain cause, and, in order not to jeopardize the ongoing campaign, his death was kept a secret.Lange 2003, pg. 71Man 2004, pg. 238 In September 1227, Emperor Mozhu surrendered to the Mongols and was promptly executed.Sinor, Shimin, Kychanov 1998, pg. 214 The Mongols then mercilessly pillaged Yinchuan, slaughtered the city's population, plundered the imperial tombs west of the city, and completed the effective annihilation of the Western Xia state.Mote 1999, pg. 256Boland-Crewe & Lea 2002, pg. 215 = Death of Genghis Khan = In August 1227, during the fall of Yinchuan, Genghis Khan died. The exact cause of his death remains a mystery, and is variously attributed to being killed in action by Western Xia, falling from his horse, illness, or wounds sustained in hunting or battle.Hart-Davis 2007, pg. 165Man 2004, pp. 239–240 The Galician-Volhynian Chronicle alleges he was killed by the Western Xia in battle, while Marco Polo wrote that he died after the infection of an arrow wound he received during his final campaign. Later Mongol chronicles connect Genghis' death with a Western Xia princess taken as war booty. One chronicle from the early 17th century even relates the legend that the princess hid a small dagger and stabbed him, though some Mongol authors have doubted this version and suspected it to be an invention by the rival Oirads.Heissig 1964, pg.124  Aftermath  Mongol Empire at the time of Genghis Khan's death in 1227. The destruction of Western Xia during the second campaign was near total. According to John Man, Western Xia is little known to anyone other than experts in the field precisely because of Genghis Khan's policy calling for their complete eradication. He states that \\"There is a case to be made that this was the first ever recorded example of attempted genocide. It was certainly very successful ethnocide.\\"Man 2004, pp. 116–117 However, some members of the Western Xia royal clan emigrated to western Sichuan, northern Tibet, even possibly northeast India, in some instances becoming local rulers.Herbert & Twitchett 1995, pg. 214. A small Western Xia state was established in Tibet along the upper reaches of the Yarlung River, while other Western Xia populations settled in what are now the modern provinces of Henan and Hebei. In China, remnants of the Western Xia persisted into the middle of the Ming dynasty.Mote 1999, pp. 256–257 Despite the death of Genghis, the Mongol Empire was at last successful in defeating Western Xia. Now, Genghis Khan's successors concentrated on unifying the rest of China. The Jin dynasty, already reeling from great losses of land and troops due to the ongoing Mongol campaign since 1211, finally collapsed in 1234. The Kingdom of Dali in southwest China fell in an invasion in 1253, and the Song dynasty of southern China, after over four decades of a conflict begun 1235, surrendered in 1279.

It is part of Marriott's Luxury Collection. It has 293 rooms, as well as a number of villas. Profile The hotel was built by MIDROC Ethiopia, and designed by architect Kosek Ivo. Sheik Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi, built the hotel as a way of creating jobs and promoting the country's image- saying that he is \\"investing in Ethiopia by following my heart, not my head\\". The hotel cost over $200 million to build, and over 500 families had to be relocated for its construction. It opened on 29 February 1998, and has been considered one of the country's leading hotels. The hotel is located between two palaces, the National Palace (formerly the Jubilee Palace), which is the residence of the President of Ethiopia, and the Menelik Palace, residence of the Prime Minister of Ethiopia. The hotel has hosted countless high-profile events, including Pan-African and African Union summits, as well as New Year’s Eve celebrations with special performances by world-renowned artists such as Beyonce, Ludacris, The Black Eyed Peas, Rihanna and Akon, among other guests. The hotel has been host to a number of celebrities, including the aforementioned performers; indeed, most, if not all, choose to stay in the Sheraton when in Ethiopia, according to The Independent. Among the many guests include Tony Blair, Rita Marley, Princess Anne, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton. Doormen at the Sheraton Addis. Confusingly, the Sheraton Addis is not part of the Sheraton hotel chain, but rather Marriott's The Luxury Collection. (As of 2015, a search on Sheraton's website would claim that \\"There are no Sheraton hotels in [Addis Ababa]\\") When it was built, the hotel was part of the ITT Sheraton Luxury Collection division of Sheraton. However, Starwood, which bought Sheraton later in 1998, spun off The Luxury Collection group as a completely different chain. Most of the \\"Sheraton\\" properties within it were gradually renamed, there are two other remaining hotels in the same situation, operating with the name Sheraton, but not technically part of Sheraton -- the Sheraton Grande Sukhumvit (Bangkok, Thailand) and Sheraton Kuwait (Kuwait City, Kuwait). In 2018, following the acquisition of Starwood Hotels by Marriott International, the Reporter newspaper reported the hotel's name would be changed to the Marriott Addis. However, this was later denied by hotel management. =Labour dispute= In February 2011, a labour dispute over compensation threatened to close the hotel. In late 2010, a union was formed at the hotel, and in December got involved in a dispute of the distribution of profits from service charges. The workers, who were already the most well-paid hotel employees in the country, taking home 5,337 Ethiopian Birr (US$283) on average per month, felt that the sharing of the service charges was not sufficient. The union argued that management should be excluded from the proceeds which would increase salaries by 52 birr. Sheik Hussein said that he felt \\"unappreciated and unrecognised\\" for his \\"generosity to employees of the hotel\\", and threatened to close the hotel for expansion work. The crisis was solved before the 15 February deadline. =Expansion plans= 42 hectares across two districts- Kirkos and Arada, was acquired by the hotel in 2004 for an expansion project, that would contain retail, a mosque, and 8050 apartments. The program was stalled, however, due to the city's inability to find funds to relocate the over 3,000 households that were to be displaced by the project. In 2010 MIDROC gave the municipality 151 million birr to expedite the process. As of 2013, the land has been cleared but construction has not begun. A model of the hotel compound. An additional 5 hectares has been set aside for the construction of a new 9-story hotel wing of 25,000 m2 containing extended stay apartments. Also included are villas, bungalows, as well as a 31,400 m2 health centre, in response to guest complaints about the paucity of health facilities. The health center will contain Olympic and outdoor tennis courts, an olympic swimming pool, restaurants, a soccer pitches, and a basketball court. This project is projected to cost $127 million. As of 2013, construction has begun on the health centre. Features The hotel has over 1,500 square meters of function space over 11 conference rooms, allowing for a capacity of 1,500 person at events. The hotel provides an array of dining options including Italian, French, Indian restaurants, as well as a poolside restaurant and all-day dining international restaurant with 5 bars and lounges. The hotel's health club, the Aqva Club, includes outdoor swimming pools, sauna, massage and Jacuzzi. A special feature of the pool is its underwater music. Within the Aqva Club is also found the special Simba Club, the children’s playground. However, the health club has been criticised in many reviews as having minimal facilities, leading to expansion plans. The hotel has a nightclub, called The Gaslight. The Sheraton Addis is the only hotel in Ethiopia to have a water treatment plant using an ultra-violet water sterilization system, which ensures sterilization and bacteria free purification of water. It has a number of generators, meaning that the hotel is never affected by the power cuts and load shedding that plague Addis Ababa.

Life Johnson was born in the Ettrick Valley, the third of four children to Bessie Bleck and James Johnstan, a herdsman. He may have been trained to become an engraver under James Reed of Edinburgh. He was a prolific engraver of music and made the plates for over half the music printed in Scotland from 1772 to 1790. His early engravings were done on copper and included Six Canzones for Two Voices (1772), A Collection of Favourite Scots Tunes … by the Late Mr Chs McLean and other Eminent Masters (c1772) and Twenty Minuets (1773) by Daniel Dow. In 1786 he became burgess of Edinburgh. On 2 July 1791 he married Charlotte Grant, daughter of the writer Lauchlan Grant. They had a son, James, baptised on 13 September 1792, who appears not to have survived to his majority. He opened a music shop, Johnson & Co., in 1790 in the Lawnmarket in Edinburgh which was continued after his death until 1815 as Johnson & Anderson by his apprentice John Anderson. He died in Edinburgh on 26 February 1811 and a public appeal was made for support for his widow in March 1819. The Scots Musical Museum Johnson had a plan for a two-volume collection of Scottish, Irish and English songs, when he met Robert Burns. The nature of the project then changed: its scope was restricted to Scottish songs, and the number of volumes rose to six, produced from 1787 to 1803. The success of the conception was not matched by financial security for Johnson. Burns contributed 184 pieces; some were original, including many of his best-known lyrics, and others were alterations of or derived from old ballads. Prefaces to some of the volumes were by Burns, who in effect edited the work. Johnson tried pewter plates to cut down the production costs. Burns produced an interleaved version of the Museum of the first four volumes for Robert Riddell.

The film would be Grieco's final film, dying in 1982. The main character of the film, Nanni Vitali, was loosely inspired by Renato Vallanzasca. Plot Dangerous criminal Nanni Vitali escapes from prison with four accomplices. The four steal a car, rob a petrol station and beat the owners to death. They then they kidnap Barbareschi, the person who had originally given the tip off to the authorities that led to Vitali's arrest. At the time of Barbareschi's kidnapping, there is also his woman, Giuliana, who is raped by Vitali himself while his accomplices beat up and kill Barbareschi. Commissioner Santini, son of the prosecutor who had sentenced Vitali, tries to stop him. Battles continue between the two: the criminals blackmail Giuliana, trying to organize a robbery with her which is unsuccessful thanks to the confession of Giuliana, who goes to the police station to reveal the intentions of the criminals. Commissioner Santini then organizes a trap in which Vitali's accomplices are captured. They manage to escape, making his way by shooting his machine gun from a speeding car. Vitali visits his sister to ask her for money and tells her that he will leave the country only after settling accounts with Commissioner Santini and with Giuliana who has betrayed him. Back in the city, he lurks in the building opposite the one where Giuliana is staying managing to wound her with a rifle. Later, having secured the collaboration of a young delinquent of his admirer, Aldo Pacesi known as Bimbo, kidnaps Carla and Judge Santini, respectively sister and father of the commissioner. Receiving phone calls asking for ransom, Inspector Santini locates the kidnappers in an abandoned shed in a small village. They shoot and kill Pacesi as Santini also manages to get the better of Vitali with a fight that ends in a hand-to-hand combat. The police intervene to arrest Vitali, and at the same time Santini's father, who had been wounded by Pacesi in a clumsy escape attempt, is taken away in an ambulance, remaining alive.

Biography Rhys Williams was born in 1890 to David Thomas Williams. In 1919 he participated in the dispute resolution between the International Structural Steel and Iron Workers Union and the Contractors Association of Cleveland, Ohio, where he was a labor arbitrator. During the 1920s and 1930s he joined the League for Industrial Democracy and by 1936 became a member of its local planning committee in Rochester, New York. In 1928 he left the Third Unitarian Church of Chicago. He supported Soviet- American relations between 1929 and 1931, probably because his brother, Albert, was a journalist in Russia, and took part in the Open Road to Russia movement. From 1933 to 1934 he was a vice president of the Rochester Torch Club, and a year later became its president, holding that office for a year. From 1936 to 1937 he served as president of the Unitarian Fellowship for Social Justice. In 1938 he was charged with Communism by the Rochester Social Justice Club because of his opposition to the racist and anti-Semitic opinions of Charles Coughlin. From 1928 to 1958 he served as minister at the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, and continued there as Minister Emeritus until his death. During the 1950s he stood in opposition to Senator Joseph McCarthy and to New York's Feinberg Law (which barred \\"subversives\\" from teaching in the state's public schools). Two years later he was given the Champion of the Oppressed award by the Unitarian Fellowship for Social Justice. He advocated independence for India, Ireland, and the Philippines, and for the Jews to be permitted to settle in Palestine. He also was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto and was a member of the World Parliament of Religions. He sponsored the Emergency Committee in Cuba and the Mental Hygiene Society in Monroe County, New York. He supported the abolition of the House Un-American Committee. He was a chairman of the Rochester Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy. He advocated placing Susan B. Anthony in the Hall of Fame, and funding for the Black Affairs Council of the Unitarian Universalist Association.

Function  An avalanche cord is 20-25 metres long and about 3.5 mm thick. It is usually made of red cotton with direction arrows positioned at metre intervals, each with the length marked in metres, and 10 cm long loops. It is wound into a ball. The ski mountaineer or climber ties the loop with the 1 metre mark (arrow against himself) around his waist. If there is a risk of avalanches he throws the ball out and pulls the avalanche cord along the snow behind him. If he is buried by an avalanche, there is a relatively good chance that part of the avalanche cord will be visible on top of the avalanche slide, thanks to its length. Rescuers can determine from the direction arrows, in which direction and how many metres they must dig and are then able to follow the cord to the victim.  History  First World War sign warning of avalanches and the need to use avalanche cords The avalanche cord was part of the personal mountaineering equipment of the Austro-Hungarian Alpine companies in the First World War. They were prescribed around 1915 for the Austrian mountain troops in the war in the mountains. Thanks to more recent developments such as avalanche transceivers the classic avalanche cord is rarely used today. The functional principle of the avalanche cord continues to be used and developed, however, in the avalanche ball.

Training Mikhail Dudko was accepted into the Imperial theatre school at the St. Petersburg Imperial troupe. His teachers were Samuil Andrianov, Viktor Semyonov (teacher and first husband of Marina Semyonova), and Leonid Leontyev. He showed his outstanding talent and was considered a future star of ballet. During an exam, he danced with a student, Lidya Ivanova, a performance that was so successful that all the teachers believed them both to have great ballet careers ahead of them. The lives of both, however, were tragic. Lidya Ivanova first became famous for her roles in small ballet. Portraits of her would be painted by famous artists, including several by Zinaida Serebriakova. Poets including Mikhail Kuzmin devoted poems to her,КУЗМИН И «СМЕРТЬ ТАНЦОВЩИЦЫ» the Russian writer Konstantin Vaginov, even making her the prototype of his heroine.Russian ballet.

Ступников She would later drown in the Gulf of Finland, June 16, 1924. During the revolution in 1917, Mikhail Dudko was a student. The Imperial theatre school where he was studying became the Soviet school, although the rules and teachers still remained the same. In 1920 he finished his studies and was admitted to the Leningrad theater of opera and ballet, formerly known as the Mariinsky Ballet.  Performances  For twenty years, he performed in many ballet roles, including:ДУДКО Михаил Андреевич *Khan’s Servant — The Little Humpbacked Horse *Jean de Brienne and Abderahman — Raymonda *Young Marquis and Actor – Flames of Paris *Eros — Eros *Prince — Swan Lake *Prince — The Nutcracker *Basilio — Don Quixote *Prince Désiré — The Sleeping Beauty *Young man — Les Sylphides *Claude Frollo and Phoebus — La Esmeralda *Albert — Giselle *Conrad — Le Corsaire *Khan Girey — The Fountain of Bakhchisarai *Paris — Romeo and Juliet *Soviet Captain — The Red Poppy *Ivan Tsarévitch — The Firebird *Gyges — Tsar Kandavl or Le Roi Candaule *Ta-Hor — The Pharaoh's Daughter *Damis — Les Ruses d'Amour *Solor — La Bayadère *Lucien d'Hervilly — Paquita *Taras Bulba — Taras Bulba *Commander — Laurencia  Discredit  After the start of World War II, in the summer of 1941, Dudko fled Leningrad and Nazi occupation for the countryside. In the same area, there was another famous actor and opera singer, Nikolay Pechkovskiy (ru: Николай Константинович Печковский). There were also several other actors present. The Germans decided to force them all to join the theatre company of the town, Gatchina, and the actors agreed because they had nowhere else to go. They continued putting on plays and earned money for their performances. The war ended after five years, but the Soviet government issued a decree that all those who had collaborated with the fascists were to be considered traitors. A lot of people were executed under this law, and the performers were considered as criminals. Mikhail Dudko and Nikolay Pechkovskiy were not executed, but they were imprisoned in Gulag camps for 8 years. In connection with the arrest of Mikhail Dudko, all his achievements in Soviet ballet were immediately taken away by the government. Soviet dictionaries and encyclopedias stated that Mikhail Dudko had been a bad dancer and had performed the main roles solely because of his beautiful appearance, not because of his ballet professionalism. Even in modern times, the encyclopedia \\"Russian ballet\\" declares: An acute shortage of soloists in the 1920s helped to Dudko quickly occupy the position of the stars of ballet, performer of the leading parties of almost all classical and contemporary repertoire. Dudko was not remarkable virtuoso dance technique, but he possessed an extremely effective scenic appearance and nobility of style, played a worthy partner of the ballerinas (ru: «Острая нехватка солистов в 1920-е гг. помогла Д. быстро занять положение премьера, исполнителя ведущих партий практически всего классич. и совр. репертуара.

Дудко Михаил Андреевич Retrieved August 20, 2013). Less biased sources consider Dudko to be among the first ballet dancers of his time, mentioning his lyricism, the sculpturing of his poses, and the noble manner of his dance - all characteristics of the so-called French school of dance. Famous Russian choreographer and ballet dancer Rostislav Zakharov also highly praised the virtuoso technique of Mikhail Dudko. Mikhail Dudko was released from prison in 1953, but he did not receive permission to return to Leningrad. He worked in provincial theatres of Ufa, Novosibirsk, Tbilisi, dancing for small roles. During this period he only had one serious role. Vakhtang Chabukiani invited M.Dudko in 1960 to participate in his film Othello, in the role of Brabantio. Only at the end of his life was Mikhail Dudko allowed to move back to his native city. However, he could not return to the profession of a ballet dancer because of his age. Mikhail Andreyevich Dudko died on September 11, 1981, in Leningrad, at the age of 78.

Asterium - under its later name Peiresiae - is shown toward the centre, near Mt. Titanus. Asterium or Asterion () was a city in ancient Thessaly mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships in Homer's Iliad as belonging to Eurypylus. Homer speaks of \\"Asterium and the white summits of Titanus - Ἀστέριον Τιτάνοιό τε λευκὰ κάρηνα. Strabo places the city in the neighbourhood of Cierium. Stephanus of Byzantium relates that the place was later called Peiresia (Πειρεσία), no doubt from the Argonautica of Apollonius of Rhodes who describes the place as near the junction of rivers Apidanus (the modern Pharsalitis) and Enipeus. Strabo, who places Titanus near Arne, also speaks of its white colour. Peiresiae is said by Apollonius to have been near Mount Phylleium. Near Mount Phylleium Strabo places a city Phyllus, noted for a temple of Apollo Phylleius. Statius calls this city Phylli.Stat. Theb. 4.45. William Smith conjectures that the town of Iresiae mentioned by Livy, is perhaps a false reading for Peiresiae; however, modern scholars treat the town as distinct from Peiresiae and suggest the site is to be found in Magnesia not at Peiresiae.

She was the first, and only, woman to become reeve of Long Branch. She and Dorothy Hague of the Village of Swansea were the first women to become reeves or mayors in the Toronto area, both taking office for the first time on January 1, 1953. As reeve, she also served on Metropolitan Toronto Council (Metro Toronto Council) from its creation in 1953 until 1962 and was the first woman on its executive. Background Born Ann Marie McCarthy in Midland, Ontario, Canada in 1912, she was one of seven children. She was raised in the United States in St. Louis, Missouri by an aunt. Curtis moved back to Canada and worked in a hat factory in Toronto. She married Bryce Curtis in 1933 and the couple settled in the village of Long Branch, then outside of Toronto, in 1935 because the rents were too high in Toronto. A self-described housewife, whose \\"political commentary was as crusty as the scrumptious apple pies she loved to bake\\", Curtis did not go to high school or college, but did take university extension courses. The firing of seven teachers in her community prompted Curtis to become involved in activism and public service. Curtis became president of the Home and School Association and successfully lobbied for kindergarten classes to be brought to the community. Curtis started attending Long Branch Council meetings. In 1950, on learning that the deputy reeve of Long Branch was about to be acclaimed, she decided to run against him and won, becoming the first woman elected to Long Branch's village council.\\"Three Major Upsets Scored in Heavy Voting In Six Suburban Areas\\", The Globe and Mail (1936-2016); Toronto, Ont. [Toronto, Ont]11 Dec 1950: 1. \\"I thought that was awful. Why he hadn't done anything but rubber-stamp the rest of the council all the time I was watching. So I went out to try and find someone to fight that drone.\\" Political career Curtis was elected reeve of Long Branch in the 1952 municipal election, defeating incumbent reeve Thomas Carter by 150 votes in an upset victory. Curtis became the first female reeve of Long Branch and was welcomed with a corsage of orchids at the first meeting. As reeve, she oversaw improvements to infrastructure such as the installation of storm sewers on every street, the paving of roads, and the planting of crab apple trees alongside them. In December 1962, Curtis opened the Long Branch Arena, a new artificial ice rink in Long Branch. A plebiscite of taxpayers had turned down using taxpayer funds, and Curtis formed a citizen's committee instead and was able to fund-raise $97,000 of the $100,000 cost within two years, getting the Ontario government to chip in $10,000 to put it over the top. In October 1954, Hurricane Hazel caused Etobicoke Creek to flood Island Road and 43rd Street and a trailer park in Long Branch, washing trailers and homes into Lake Ontario, killing seven persons. 700 people were evacuated from the trailer park and streets. Curtis oversaw the relocation of flood victims and advocated for the conversion of a flood plain on which the devastated homes stood into parkland, for which she was able to get the support of Metro Chairman Fred Gardiner. A million ($ in dollars) plan to demolish 300 homes, the trailer park and create a park was developed. Curtis delivered compensation checks personally to the flood victims. As reeve, Curtis became a member of York County Council also, which opposed the Cumming Report to create Metropolitan Toronto, which grouped Toronto and its surrounding suburbs into a two-tier government The Government of Ontario over-rode the suburban concerns and Metropolitan Toronto came into being in 1954, while Metro Toronto Council came into being first, on April 15, 1953 and Curtis became a member of the first Metro Toronto Council. At Metro, Curtis was a critic of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). She was an opponent of the two-zone fare plan put in place by Metro and the TTC, causing persons in Long Branch to pay two fares to get downtown, while service was poor. Curtis and other suburban politicians organized protests and community meetings, but were unsuccessful in stopping its implementation, although they were able to block the TTC's suburban representative from reappointment. Curtis arranged for Allan Lamport, TTC commissioner and William Russell, chairman of the TTC, to ride from Long Branch to downtown and back, to impress upon them the slow service. They compared times with Curtis' times recorded the week before by Long Branch residents. The trips took 20 minutes less than usual, and Curtis claimed that the TTC had arranged a \\"smart fix\\", having extra streetcars and inspectors around during the test, a claim the TTC denied. In 1962, Curtis claimed that the TTC was concealing a report that a one-zone policy would cut its annual deficit by half. The two-zone policy was phased out in 1973. Streetcars still travel along Lake Shore Boulevard to Long Branch Loop. GO Transit service direct to downtown was inaugurated in the 1960s and it included a Long Branch station. Curtis was the first woman to sit on Metro Toronto Council's executive committee but lost her place on the body after leading a fight up to the Supreme Court of Canada against a tax to help pay for the construction of the TTC's Bloor-Danforth subway. A portion of the funds would come from TTC fares, but Curtis and others wanted the entire project to be funded from fares. She objected to a proposed $7 property tax increase to pay for the subway saying, “I am afraid these taxes will tie people up so tightly it will make them move out of here, the same as some of us moved from the city” and claiming that the subway would be “of doubtful benefit to our municipality.” Long Branch, Mimico, New Toronto, Etobicoke and Scarborough all objected and opposed the proposal at the Ontario Municipal Board in August 1958, followed by an appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal in October 1958. After failing in both cases, Etobicoke and Scarborough dropped out, leaving the Lakeshore municipalities to continue. A week after filing her appeal to the Supreme Court, Curtis was voted off of the Metro executive by Metro Toronto Council and replaced by a pro-subway councillor. The Supreme Court of Canada sided with Metro Toronto on the case and denied an appeal. In 1962, Curtis opposed Metro Toronto providing an annual subsidy to the TTC. Retirement Curtis retired from politics in 1962. According to Curtis, two major reasons for her to get into politics had been resolved: storm sewers and paved roads in Long Branch. The lack of sewers had caused her garden to flood after every storm. The lack of paved roads meant that Long Branch sprinkled tar yearly on dirt roads, leaving children to track the tar into the house. Curtis moved with her husband to a retirement home in Flesherton, Ontario. After leaving Long Branch she served for six years as secretary of the Association of Mayors and Reeves in Ontario. Curtis had served as its president in 1958. She also served as spokesperson and advisor to members of Grey County Council in the 1960s and 1970s. Curtis advocated in 1962 for the amalgamation of Long Branch with neighbouring villages Mimico and New Toronto, on the basis that the three small communities had three votes on Metro Council, more votes than larger municipalities in Metro. The proposal eventually went to the Ontario Municipal Board, which left the villages in place. The Government of Ontario amalgamated the three communities into Etobicoke in 1967, and later Toronto. Curtis died in 2006 at the age of 94 of an apparent stroke in the Grey Gables home in Markdale, Ontario. Curtis' husband died in 1998, and her son Bill in 1987. She was survived by her daughter Joan McGee, five grandchildren and ten great- grandchildren. Curtis was interred in Markdale Cemetery. The Curtis's modest bungalow at 10 31st street in Long Branch was demolished in 2018. The 35-acre park created at the mouth of Etobicoke Creek was named Marie Curtis Park in her honour. It was dedicated on June 5, 1959 by Fred Gardiner, the Metro Chairman, and is marked by a plaque and cairn. Curtis is an inductee into the Etobicoke Hall of Fame. She was inducted in 1988.

Truth Games(1998), Family of Guguletu Seven - why were you smiling – Capt. John Sterrenberg Sue Williamson (born 1941) is an artist and writer based in Cape Town, South Africa. Messages from the Atlantic Passage, Installation, Basel Unlimited 2017, Switzerland  Life  Sue Williamson was born in Lichfield, England in 1941. In 1948 she immigrated with her family to South Africa. Between 1963 and 1965 she studied at the Art Students League of New York. In 1983 she earned her Advanced Diploma in Fine Art from the Michaelis School of Fine Art, Cape Town. In 2007 she received the Visual Arts Research Award from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C and in 2011 the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Creative Arts Fellowship. In 2013 she was a guest curator of the summer academy at the Zentrum Paul Klee in Bern.  Work  Williamson's work engages with themes related to memory and identity formation. Trained as a printmaker, Williamson has worked across a variety of media including archival photography, video, mixed media installations, and constructed objects. Her earlier work, such as Mementos of District Six (1993), Out of the Ashes (1994), and R.I.P. Annie Silinga (1995), are a few early examples that convey her investment in the recuperation and interrogation of South African history. Since the coming of democracy in 1994, in works such as Truth Games, Can’t Forget, Can't Remember, Messages from the Moat, and Better Lives, Williamson has continued to focus on such issues as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, slavery, and immigration. In No More Fairy Tales (2016), a series of five two-channel video conversations highlights the reality of daily life in South Africa twenty years after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was embarked upon as a process which many hoped then would bring healing to the stricken country. In mid 2015, with student unrest that swept across the country it became clear that the wounds had not healed. One of the first completed videos - It's a pleasure to meet you - follows a conversation between two young people in their twenties - Candice Mama and Siyah Mgoduka - whose fathers were killed by apartheid assassin Eugene de Kock. In One Hundred and Nineteen Deeds of Sale (2018), the names given by slave masters, ages, sexes, and places of birth, along with the names of buyers and sellers, prices paid, and the date of purchase of people from the slave trade in India are written in black ink on cotton shirts. The shirts are imported from India, dipped into muddy waters drawn from the Cape Coast Castle, and hung around the grounds until Heritage Day, September 24, 2019. They are then taken down and returned to India, where they are washed clean and rehung as an installation at the Aspinwall House in Kochi. These people were transported by Dutch East India Company to work at the Cape Town Castle and the Company's Gardens. One Hundred and Nineteen Deeds of Sale Williamson incorporates the history and memory of the slave trade in order to transform the stigmatizing history into a history that can address and combat global inequalities. Upon opening the exhibition, WIlliamson read extracts of historical accounts while a woman picked up each shirt, read out the information on it, and then took it inside to be dipped in mud and hung on a washing line. Art brings history of slave trade to life The installation tells a story of loss and symbolizes the essence of a person that is floating in the wind, but all that remains is their memory. Sue Williamson, 'One Hundred and Nineteen Deeds of Sale' Williamson's ethical lens has expanded in more recent years to consider social issues on a more global scale, as in her work 'Other Voices, Other Cities, from 2009.  Public collections  Williamson's work is in the collection of a variety of museums, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the National Museum of African Art - Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., the South African National Gallery in Cape Town, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Williamson has also participated in group exhibitions including The Short Century (2001), Liberated Voices (1999), the Johannesburg Art Biennale (in 1997 and 1995), the Havana Biennale (1994), and the Venice Biennale (1993).

It is located just off Linthorpe Road outside the entrance gates to Albert Park in front of the Dorman Museum. It commemorates the local men who lost their lives in the First and Second World Wars and other conflicts. The cenotaph was built on land given by Sir Arthur Dorman who favoured a replica of The Cenotaph in Whitehall, London. The cenotaph was designed by Brierley and Rutherford of York based on the Whitehall cenotaph, and built in 1922 by masons Messrs Coxhead of Middlesbrough at a cost of over £17,000. It was unveiled on 11 November that year by the deputy mayor of Middlesbrough J.G. Pallister in memory of over 3,000 local men from the Yorkshire Regiment and others who lost their lives in the First World War. The cenotaph was constructed using polished grey Aberdeen granite ashlar and stands over 10m high. After the Second World War the cenotaph was rededicated to those who died in that conflict and other wars. The north and south faces of the monument are inscribed with the epitaph \\"THE GLORIOUS DEAD 1914–1919, 1939–1945\\". The Cenotaph and surrounds were restored and improved in 2008 at a cost of £275,000. Work included cleaning and pointing, pedestrianisation of the surrounding area, and improved lighting.

It believes that a person's actions in this world are what count and that humanity is called to engage the world, both with compassion and with love. A stated tenet of the church is to respect all faith traditions and not to ignore their importance or their differences. Christianity is acknowledged as different from Buddhism. Islam is acknowledged as different from Humanism, and so forth.

It is capable of hosting 400 vehicles and has a 45 by 96 foot movie screen. As of August 2013, it has been operated by the same family for over 60 years. The welcome screen at Cumberland Drive-In Theater History Cumberland Drive-In Theatre was opened by Donn Mowery on August 1, 1952 and celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2012. The first movie ever shown at Cumberland Drive-In was Annie Get Your Gun. The theater was built just before the peak years of drive-in theater popularity. At the height of the drive-in culture there were over 4,000 drive-in theaters in the United States: 25% of the nation’s movie theaters. Today Cumberland Drive-In is one of 368 remaining drive-ins in the United States. Its location is ideal in that it is close to Interstate 81 and U.S. Route 11, making it easily accessible. Even though it is near the area’s major highways, the drive-in is situated in a low- population area with dark skies. After the closure of Sunset Drive-In in nearby Chambersburg, the Cumberland Drive-In became the only drive-in theater to service Chambersburg, Hagerstown, MD and the surrounding area. The Cumberland Drive-In Theatre features a snack bar and a large playground area. The theater is family friendly; most features are rated G, PG or PG-13, with R features typically showing in the latter part of the season. Children play while waiting for movie at Cumberland Drive In The theater is one of 4 businesses of “81Fun” which includes Cumberland Drive-In, Midway Skating, Midway Bowling, and Cumberland Golf Club – all owned by the Mowery family. Digital versus 35 millimeter  In 2013, movie studios announced that they would be switching from 35 millimeter films to digital distribution –exclusively – by the end of the year. The average cost for an outdoor or single-screen theater to convert to digital projection is approximately $75,000. As of 2013, Cumberland Drive-In was using the same movie projector it used in 1952. The only major change is that in 2003 the lamp houses were changed from carbon arc lamp to powerful light bulbs. Ticket sales do not generate large sums of money for drive-in theaters such as the Cumberland Drive-In. Film companies claim most of the ticket price. Concession sales (food and drink) are the main source of profit for the Cumberland (and for most theaters). In addition, many drive-ins (such as the Cumberland) are only open in late spring and in summer. It may take 10-15 years for smaller drive- in theaters to pay for the new equipment. In order to survive, the theater competed for one of five digital projectors being donated by Honda as part of Project Drive-In. Because of the switch to digital projection, a substantial number of the remaining drive-in theaters faced closing their doors after the summer season. As of August 2013, Honda was urging drive-in patrons to take advantage of social media (such as Facebook and Twitter) and texting in order to vote for their favorite theater. Previous technology updates (movies downloaded from the Internet, cable television, etc.) cost the Cumberland Drive-In in terms of fewer visitors. The mandated switch to digital, however, is different: film companies are forcing drive-ins to change. Movies will no longer be available in cans of 35 mm film. Despite the odds, co-owner Jay Mowery was optimistic, saying, “To say we're closing, I hope not. We'd have to explore our options. It would be great if we got this. We want to continue to provide family entertainment to the community and that means converting to digital. It's not only about the cars and drive-in movies; it's also about people's fond memories that date back to the 1950s”. The Cumberland opened in the spring of 2014 to find a diminished pool of available celluloid prints, with many of the popular religious-themed features like Heaven Is for Real unavailable at all on film. Finally, on June 26, the drive-in made the changeover to digital. The first features shown on that Thursday night were Transformers: Age of Extinction and X-Men: Days of Future Past.

He is the CEO of Yelp, which he co-founded in 2004. Stoppelman obtained a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1999. After briefly working for @Home Network, he worked at X.com and later became the VP of Engineering after the company was renamed PayPal. Stoppelman left PayPal to attend Harvard Business School. During a summer internship at MRL Ventures, he and others came up with the idea for Yelp Inc. He turned down an acquisition offer by Google and took the company public in 2012. Early life Stoppelman was born in Arlington, Virginia in 1977. His mother, Lynn, was an English teacher, and his father, John, was a securities lawyer. Stoppelman is Jewish. He attended Langley High School and a Reform temple as a child and had a Bar Mitzvah. As a child Stoppelman had an interest in computers and business and began investing in stocks at the age of 14. Stoppelman aspired to be a video game developer and took computer programming classes, where he learned the Turbo Pascal software programming system. He attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and obtained a bachelor's degree in computer engineering in 1999. After graduating he took a job with @Home Network. Career After four months of working for @Home Network, Stoppelman accepted a position as an engineer at X.com, which later became PayPal. It was here that Stoppelman met businessman Max Levchin, who later became an investor in Stoppelman's company, Yelp Inc. Stoppelman became the V.P. of engineering at PayPal, and is one of a group of PayPal's early employees sometimes referred to as the PayPal Mafia. Stoppelman left PayPal after its 2003 acquisition by eBay and attended Harvard Business School for one year. During Stoppelman's school break Levchin persuaded Stoppelman to do an internship at the business incubator, MRL ventures. =Yelp= In the summer of 2004, Jeremy Stoppelman got the flu and had a hard time finding recommendations for a local doctor. He and former PayPal colleague, Russel Simmons, who was also working at MRL Ventures, began brainstorming on how to create an online community where users could share recommendations for local services. Stoppelman and Simmons pitched the idea to Levchin who provided $1 million in initial funding. Under Stoppelman's leadership, Yelp grew to a market capitalization of $4 billion and hosted 138 million user reviews. Steve Jobs called Stoppelman in January 2010 in an effort to persuade him to turn down an acquisition offer by Google and in March 2012 Stoppelman rang the bell for the New York Stock Exchange after Yelp went public. According to Stoppelman, the biggest challenge at Yelp has been \\"the same problem Google faces in its rankings.\\" Business owners have been suing reviewers that leave negative reviews and raising allegations that Yelp tampers with reviews to favor companies that advertise, leading to legal troubles for the company. In February 2013, Stoppelman accepted a salary of $1, though he continues to earn income from the investment of his 11 percent interest in the company. Stoppelman was the target of a viral 2016 open letter by Talia Jane on Medium, who worked at a Yelp subsidiary Eat24 in San Francisco. The letter described the difficulties Jane and her coworkers faced trying to live in the Bay Area on the wages provided to her, noting that she could not afford groceries or to use a heater in the winter. She was fired immediately after the letter's publication. Stoppelman denied her firing was a result of the letter. Yelp increased wages and benefits for low-level employees two months after the letter's publication. Management style Stoppelman has a hands-on management style. Instead of a corner office, he has a desk among his employees. In a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything), when asked about the single most important management technique he'd learned and where, he said \\"This one I got from PayPal, but I'm a strong believer in doing one on one meetings with each of my reports every week. Sometimes I feel like the company's psychiatrist, but I do feel like listening to people and hearing about their problems (personal and professional) cleans out the cobwebs and keeps the organization humming.” Personal Stoppelman is a \\"voracious\\" non-fiction reader, and his brother Michael previously worked at Yelp as Senior Vice President of Engineering. As of 2012, Stoppelman had written over one-thousand Yelp reviews. As of 2011, his net worth was estimated to be $111 million to $222 million.

The novels reflect a complex, multi-ethnic and ever-evolving L.A., with an eye to the connections and tensions that develop in that proximity. Race, class, historical context, sexual orientation and politics all play an intrinsic part in Revoyr's fiction: \\"Not because I'm trying to be politically correct but because that is the world as I know it.\\" In a 2014 APA interview she elaborated \\"By virtue of who the characters are and the situations I put them in, I hope to compel readers to think about issues of race, community, love, family, the things we have in common, and the things that make us different.

Sunny is a female Portuguese Water Dog, who has been called the younger sister of Bo, who held the title of First Dog of the United States. Sunny was introduced via First Lady Michelle Obama's Twitter account on August 19, 2013. Breed background The Portuguese Water Dog is originally from the Algarve region of Portugal. Only 48 Portuguese Water Dogs were entered for Britain's Crufts competition in 2009 and the author of The New Complete Portuguese Water Dog, Kitty Braund, believes there are about 50,000 in North America. Due to its fleecy coat of non-shedding hair (instead of fur), the Portuguese Water Dog is considered a hypoallergenic dog breed. Portuguese water dogs are super swimmers, or superior seafarers, because they have webbed toes. The breed was important to fishers along the coast of Portugal as a companion and guard dog. Lisa Peterson, spokesperson for the American Kennel Club (AKC), stated, \\"The Portuguese water dog is historically a working dog, a fisherman's accompaniment. When you think of their history with fishermen, they were a team – that's the environment they thrive in.\\" The breed was almost pushed to extinction toward the end of the nineteenth century until Vasco Bensaude, a wealthy Portuguese businessman, became interested in saving the breed in the 1930s. Thirty years later the breed reached the United States, where they became classified in the Working Group. (recognized by the American Kennel Club) According to American Kennel Club, the dogs do jobs such as guard dog, pulling sleds, and rescuing people and things from water – they are mostly family friendly. \\"People who love Portuguese water dogs say they are like potato chips, you can't have just one. That bubbly, happy personality is the whole package. The beautiful coat, the trainability, the need for a job. They're just adorable\\", according to Lisa Peterson. This quote explains why the Obamas chose to get another Portuguese water pup, after they got their first one (Bo) in 2009 – younger dogs will mimic the behaviors of older dogs so the two siblings get along well. Breeding and original owners Sunny is a purebred Portuguese Water Dog, and was selected from a breeder in the Great Lakes area. Media response Although Sunny was purchased from a breeder, president of The Humane Society of the United States, Wayne Pacelle, wrote on a blog post, \\"As we always say in such circumstances, we hope the Obamas considered adoption or rescue as the first choice in obtaining a pet.\\" He further went on to thank the Obama family for making a contribution to the Humane Society in Sunny's name, and helping reduce the suffering of dogs, although he would like the policies to finally become law. Incidents There have been minor incidents involving Sunny. In 2013, at a Military family arts and crafts event, Sunny knocked over a 2-year- old girl while in front of Michelle Obama. However, the child was unharmed. Sunny was not aggressive to the child, licking her face. In January 2017, Sunny reportedly bit a White House visitor on the face, leaving a cut under the visitor's eye, which required stitches. The visitor, who was a teen friend of Malia, was treated by the president's physician Dr. Ronny Jackson.

Her other early work involves issues of violence against women, oppression and peacemaking, with many essays focusing on war rape and just war theory. Her later work addresses these issues along with solidarity, as explored in her book Political Solidarity (2008). Her work on solidarity involves research on collective movements for social change and global and transnational feminist accounts of solidarity. Publications Scholz served as Editor of APA Newsletter on Feminism and Philosophy from 2003 to 2008 and Co-editor for the Journal for Peace and Justice Studies from 2006 to 2011. She is the former Editor of Hypatia, resigning in protest in 2017 due to the Hypatia transracialism controversy that took place under her stewardship.

Mussett. She has published 20 peer reviewed journal articles, 10 anthology contributions and 20 book reviews. She also contributed articles to the Encyclopedia of Global Justice (2011), edited by Deen Chatterjee. =Political Solidarity= In Political Solidarity, Scholz argues for greater nuance in the meaning of solidarity and highlights three distinct types of solidarity: social solidarity, civic solidarity, and political solidarity. She finds all three types of solidarity importantly distinct, although they do have some unifying characteristics. Scholz goes to great efforts to avoid vagueness when discussing concepts, providing concrete articulations of concepts like 'injustice' and 'oppression,' rather than resorting to vague or demogogic treatments of such concepts. Scholz notes that effective political solidarity can only occur through a \\"genuine mutually shared commitment to a cause.\\" Scholz argues that political solidarity is a moral relation among humans; political solidarity with non-human animals, then, is not possible but political solidarity on behalf of nonhuman animals is. Some ecofeminists have challenged her on this point, seeking to conceptualize solidarity with non- humans. Scholz has suggested that a more fruitful approach is to think of the moral relations of social solidarity with non-human animals.

Space Launch Complex 40 was damaged in the Amos-6 accident on September 2016 and repair work was completed by December 2017. SpaceX believes that they can optimize their launch operations, and reduce launch costs, by dividing their launch missions amongst these four launch facilities: LC-39A for NASA launches, SLC-40 for USAF national security launches, SLC-4E for polar launches, and South Texas Launch Site for commercial launches. COO Gwynne Shotwell stated in 2014 that \\"we are expanding in all of our locations\\" and \\"you will end up seeing a lot of SpaceX launch sites in order to meet the future demand that we anticipate.\\" , SpaceX discussed preliminary plans to launch an average of 90 rockets per year after 2019. SpaceX have indicated that, depending on market demand, they may actually need another commercial launch site in addition to the Texas location. In 2016, SpaceX signed a five-year lease to use a former Spacehab building at Port Canaveral. A new building nearby is also planned, and these facilities would be used to refurbish rockets. In addition, SpaceX uses a suborbital test facility, the SpaceX Rocket Development and Test Facility in Texas. A high-altitude suborbital test facility was under construction in New Mexico, but was abandoned following the switch to flight tests on commercial missions. SpaceX has indicated that they see a niche for each of the four orbital facilities currently in use or under construction, and that they have sufficient launch business to fill each pad, particularly so by the end of the decade if SpaceX business remains strong.  Cape Canaveral Air Force Station  Falcon 9, Flight 3, above SpaceX Cape Canaveral launch complex, May 2012. In 2007, the US Air Force leased Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40 to SpaceX to launch the Falcon 9 rocket. During April 2008, construction started on the ground facilities necessary to support the launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Renovations included installation of new liquid oxygen and kerosene tanks and construction of a hangar for rocket and payload preparation. The first Falcon 9 rocket arrived at SLC-40 in late 2008, and was first erected on January 10, 2009. It successfully reached orbit on its maiden launch on June 4, 2010, carrying a dummy payload qualification unit. SpaceX modified the launch pad in 2013 in order to support launches of the Falcon 9 v1.1 launch vehicle, a 60 percent heavier rocket with 60 percent more thrust on realigned engines and 60 percent longer fuel tank than the v1.0 version of the Falcon 9, requiring a modified transporter/erector. In September 2016, the pad was damaged when a Falcon 9 rocket exploded during liquid oxygen loading in preparation for a hot-fire test. The pad was repaired and used for the first time since the explosion in the SpaceX CRS-13 mission in December 2017.  Kennedy Space Center  Robert D. Cabana, director of KSC, announces the signing of the LC-39A lease agreement on April 14, 2014. In December 2013, NASA and SpaceX were in negotiations for SpaceX to lease Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A, after SpaceX was selected in a multi-company bid process, following NASA's decision in early 2013 to lease the unused complex out as part of a bid to reduce annual operation and maintenance costs of unused government facilities. The SpaceX bid was for exclusive use of the launch complex to support their future crewed missions, but SpaceX said in September 2013 that they are also willing to support a multi-user arrangement for LC-39A, and they reiterated that position in December 2013. A competing bid for commercial use of the launch complex was submitted by Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, who bid for a shared non-exclusive use of the complex such that the launchpad can interface with multiple vehicles, and costs of pad operational expenses could be shared over the long term. One potential shared user in the Blue Origin notional plan was with United Launch Alliance. In September 2013—prior to completion of the bid period, and prior to any public announcement by NASA of the results of the process—Blue Origin filed a protest with the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) over what it said was \\"a plan by NASA to award an exclusive commercial lease to SpaceX for use of mothballed space shuttle launch LC-39A.\\" NASA planned to complete the bid award and have the pad transferred by October 1, 2013, but the protest delayed a decision until after the GAO resolved the protest. Following the eruption of the controversy, on September 21, SpaceX said that they were willing to support a multi-user arrangement for LC-39A. In December 2013, the GAO denied the protest and sided with NASA, which argued that the solicitation contains no preference on the use of the facility as multi-use or single-use. \\"The [solicitation] document merely asks bidders to explain their reasons for selecting one approach instead of the other and how they would manage the facility.\\" SpaceX began architectural and engineering design work on the pad modifications in 2013, and signed the contractual documents to lease the pad for 20 years from NASA in April 2014. SpaceX is building a large Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF) just outside the perimeter of the existing launch pad in order to \\"house the Falcon [rockets] and associated hardware and payloads during processing.\\" This is a marked difference from the vertical integration facility used by previous US government rockets that used the launch pad (Apollo Program and the Space Shuttle)—plus the installation of all new instrumentation and control systems, with substantial new plumbing for a variety of rocket liquids and gasses. The Falcon rockets will be transported from the HIF to the launch pad aboard a Transporter Erector (TE) which will ride on rails up the former crawlerway path. In February 2016, it was reported that the pad was completed and activated indicating it is ready for launches of Falcon 9 Full Thrust. The first SpaceX launch from LC-39A occurred in February 2017, followed by a successful first-stage landing at Landing Zone 1. Further work will be needed to support Falcon Heavy and crewed launches which is expected to take at least 60 days and is currently planned to occur after Cape Canaveral LC-40 is back in operation, not earlier than October 2017. SpaceX's first crewed space missions are expected to launch in 2019 from the Kennedy LC-39A launch pad. In April 2018, SpaceX completed a draft environmental assessment for a new facility \\"that would include a booster processing hangar and launch control center on of KSC property\\" to support a faster flight rate of \\"Falcon rockets, including processing of landed booster stages and recovered payload fairings for reuse.\\"SpaceX proposing expansion of Florida launch processing facilities, 11 June 2018, accessed 12 June 2018. = Future support = The SpaceX Starship was initially deemed too large to launch from any existing SpaceX facility. In 2014, SpaceX indicated that the historic Florida launchpad LC-39A would not be large enough, and they planned to build a new site to accommodate the rocket. The Starship is projected to be powered by 37 Raptor liquid oxygen/liquid methane engines producing approximately of thrust at liftoff. (This needs updating, no longer true) However, in his September 2016 presentation, Elon Musk stated that the large launch vehicle would indeed be launched from LC-39A.  Vandenberg Air Force Base  west coast launch facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base, during the launch of CASSIOPE, September 2013. SpaceX operate a West Coast launch site located at Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 4 in order to deliver satellites to polar or Sun-synchronous orbits with Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches. SpaceX broke ground at Vandenberg in July 2011. A 2011 estimate showed that the project was expected to cost between $20 to $30 million for the first 24 months of construction and operation; thereafter, operational costs were expected to be $5–10 million per year. The sixth flight of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle launched in September 2013, which was the maiden flight of Falcon 9 v1.1. The site was used for a second time in January 2016 for the Jason-3 launch (which was the last flight of Falcon 9 v1.1) and for a third time in January 2017 for the first of the Iridium Next launches.  Other launch pads  The first Falcon 1 at SpaceX's leased launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. This vehicle was removed from VAFB due to delays and eventually launched from Omelek Island. SpaceX originally intended to launch their first launch vehicle, the Falcon 1, from Space Launch Complex 3 West (SLC-3W) at Vandenberg Air Force Base. SLC-3W was modified by SpaceX to support the Falcon 1, and the Falcon 1 was erected on the pad in 2005. Problems arose when SpaceX was unable to obtain sufficient launch window availability because the pad would overfly other Air Force pads that were frequently left occupied for weeks or months at a time, thus severely restricting SpaceX launches. Ultimately, this launch pad was never used for orbital launch, although it was used for a number of ground tests. SpaceX proceeded to then build a launch facility in the northern Pacific Ocean at the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site, on Omelek Island, a part of the Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands. SpaceX began launching Falcon 1 rockets from Omelek in 2006. Falcon 1 Flight 4 was the first successful privately funded, liquid-propelled launch vehicle to achieve orbit, and was launched from Omelek Island on 28 September 2008, followed by another Falcon 1 launch on 13 July 2009, placing RazakSAT into orbit. SpaceX originally planned to upgrade the Omelek launch site for use by the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, but later cancelled their plans to do so, and have since disassembled the entire installation. In December 2010, the SpaceX launch manifest listed Omelek (Kwajalein) as a potential site for several Falcon 9 launches, the first planned for as early as 2012. The \\"Falcon 9 Overview\\" document also offered Kwajalein as a launch option in 2010. Since then, the FAA Environmental Impact Report of May 2014 lists this site as non-operational and returned to its original state, to no longer be used, \\"Five Falcon 1 launches occurred at Omelek Island, Kwajalein Atoll. After these launches of the Falcon 1, the site was no longer needed and SpaceX closed the site and returned the property to pre-launch conditions\\". All Falcon 1 launches took place at this location, five launches from 2006 to 2009. SpaceX abandoned Omelek when Falcon 1 was retired, due to the expense of logistics.  Suborbital test facilities  SpaceX has two rocket test facilities for vertical takeoff, vertical landing rockets: the SpaceX Rocket Development and Test Facility in McGregor, Texas and a leased test facility at Spaceport America in southern New Mexico. All SpaceX rocket engines are tested on rocket test stands, and low-altitude VTVL flight testing of the Falcon 9 Grasshopper v1.0 test vehicle are done at McGregor. High-altitude, high-velocity flight testing of Grasshopper v1.1 were planned to be done at Spaceport America. In addition to atmospheric flight testing, and rocket engine testing, the McGregor facility is also used for post-flight disassembly and defueling of the SpaceX Dragon following orbital missions. Both flight test facilities are principally involved in developing and testing various elements of the SpaceX reusable launch system development program, with a goal to making future SpaceX launch systems fully and rapidly reusable. =SpaceX Rocket Development and Test Facility, McGregor, Texas= thumb SpaceX's Rocket Development and Test Facility in McGregor, Texas is used for research and development of new rocket engines and thrusters as well as for testing final manufactured engines, various components, and engines during development. Although SpaceX manufactures all of their rocket engines and thrusters at their Hawthorne headquarters, each must pass through McGregor where the company tests each new engine off of the assembly line as well as those being developed for future missions to orbit and beyond before each one can be used on a flight mission. \\"The company's headquarters and factory in ... southern California gets a lot of the attention, but most of the noisy, dirty and critical testing work is done just outside this small central Texas town nestled in amid the farm fields.\\" Extensive and repeated rocket engine testing is a key to increasing reliability and thereby mission success, while lowering operating cost for SpaceX. Dragon spacecraft, following use on a space mission, splashdown and recovery, are shipped to McGregor for de- fueling, cleanup, and refurbishment for potential reuse in flight missions. The first scaled methane-fueled Raptor rocket engine, manufactured at the Hawthorne facility in California, shipped to McGregor by August 2016 for development testing. In 2011, the company announced plans to upgrade the facility for launch testing a VTVL rocket, known as Grasshopper, and then constructed a half-acre concrete launch facility in 2012 to support the test flight program. After 8 flights of Grasshopper, and 5 flights of its successor \\"F9R Dev1\\" between 2012 and 2014, the FAA permit to fly Grasshopper flight tests in Texas expired in October 2014. In 2003,U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (November 2011) \\"Final Environmental Assessment for Issuing an Experimental Permit to SpaceX for Operation of the Grasshopper Vehicle at the McGregor Test Site, Texas\\" , p. 1. the company leased the McGregor testing facilities of defunct Beal Aerospace—on land formerly used for the World War II Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant—where it refitted the largest test stand at the facilities for Falcon 9 engine testing. SpaceX has made a number of improvements to the facility since purchase, and has also extended the size of the facility by purchasing several pieces of adjacent farmland. The area to support the test facility was initially just but by April 2011 this more than doubled to over . With only three initial employees onsite, the facility grew to over 140 employees by late 2011. , the McGregor facility consisted of seven test stands operated 18 hours a day, six days a week, and was building more test stands because production was ramping up and the company had a large manifest in the next several years. , the McGregor facility operated 11 test stands involved in the rocket engine test program, and was averaging two tests each day. The largest test stand by 2013 was the tall Falcon 9 tripod. , the facility comprised , with 12 test stands; it had run over 4000 Merlin engine tests, including some 50 firings of the integrated nine-engine first stage. In May 2016, the McGregor City Council instituted more restrictive rules on rocket engine, rocket stage, and low-altitude flight testing. SpaceX has not commented publicly on how the new rules will affect their testing operations, nor whether they will be evaluating other locations where they might conduct such testing. In 2019, SpaceX begin refitting the original vertical test stand at McGregor—previously used for testing Falcon 9 booster stages and second stages starting in the mid-2000s—to be a vertical test stand for Raptor rocket engines to add test capabilities not present in their multiple-bay Raptor test stand. Rocket engines designed for many uses, tested constantly in horizontal test stands with a gravity gradient orthogonal to the turbine pumps, have somewhat differing wear characteristics on the bearing surfaces which increases wear on startup and shutdown.https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1183813898748563456 =SpaceX high-altitude test facility, New Mexico= As part of the SpaceX reusable launch system development program, SpaceX announced in May 2013 that the follow up to Grasshopper, a high-altitude, vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL) suborbital technology demonstrator would be tested at Spaceport America near Las Cruces, New Mexico. SpaceX signed a three-year lease for land and facilities at the recently operational spaceport. , SpaceX indicated that they did not yet know how many jobs would move from McGregor, Texas to New Mexico to support the second phase of VTVL Grasshopper testing. In 2013, SpaceX constructed a pad at Spaceport America, southwest of the spaceport's main campus, and will lease the pad for per month plus per Grasshopper flight. The spaceport administrator expected SpaceX to be operational at the Spaceport between October 2013 and February 2014, and anticipated that the lease payments would begin at that time. By May 2014, SpaceX expended more than on construction of the New Mexico facility, and is using more than 20 local firms to work on the project. Work items have included modifying the Range Operations Plan as well as a variety of fire-prevention measures. While in July 2014 the first test flight was still expected to occur sometime in 2014,Businesses prepare for first flight , Las Cruces Bulletin, Alta LeCompte, 11 July 2014, accessed 30 July 2014. reports in October 2014 indicated that the first flight of F9R Dev2 at Spaceport America would not occur until the first half of 2015. On 19 February 2015, SpaceX announced that the F9R Dev2 would be discontinued indicating that ocean tests using operational Falcon 9 rockets were sufficiently successful that it was no longer necessary. Instead the New Mexico site will be used for testing the returned first stages. During April 2015, SpaceX performed tanking tests on the In-Flight Abort rocket on the Vandenberg Air Force Base SLC-4E. Since this rocket only possessed three Merlin 1D engines, it was speculated that the discontinued F9R Dev2 was re- purposed as the launch vehicle in the In-Flight Abort Test. = SpaceX South Texas Launch Site = Map showing proposed locations of the control center and vertical launch area at the Texas facility, from the FAA draft Environmental Impact Statement, April 2013. Until 2019, SpaceX was building a new spaceport at Boca Chica Village near Brownsville, Texas for their private use, with an emphasis on commercial space transport work. The site is to be optimized for launches of commercial telecommunication satellites that would be launched to the east, across the Gulf of Mexico into geostationary transfer orbits. During 2011–2014, SpaceX considered as many as seven potential locations around the country for a new private launch facility for orbital flights, including Alaska, California, Florida, Texas, Virginia, Georgia, and Puerto Rico. One of the proposed locations for the new commercial-mission-only spaceport was south Texas, which was revealed in April 2012, via preliminary regulatory documentation. The FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation began a multi-year process to conduct an Environmental Impact Statement and public hearings on the new launch site, which would be located in Cameron County, Texas. The site was to initially support up to 12 commercial launches per year, including two Falcon Heavy launches. As early as March 2013, Texas became the leading candidate for the location of the new SpaceX commercial launch facility, although Florida, Georgia and other locations remained in the running. Legislation was introduced in the Texas Legislature in early 2013 that would enable temporary closings of State beaches during launches, limit liability for noise and some other specific commercial spaceflight risks, while the legislature also considered a package of incentives to encourage SpaceX to locate at the Brownsville, Texas location. The Texas incentive package and beach closing legislation is now in place. In October 2013, CEO Musk said that \\"Texas is looking increasingly likely,\\" waiting for final regulatory approvals. The FAA released the draft Environmental Impact Statement in April 2013, and \\"found that 'no impacts would occur' that would force the Federal Aviation Administration to deny SpaceX a permit for rocket operations near Brownsville.\\" See also *SpaceX reusable launch system development program *SpaceX Landing Zone References ","title":"SpaceX launch facilities"},{"id":"40305822","text":"Map of Bouvetøya Mowinckelkysten is a coastal area at the southeastern side of the island of Bouvetøya.

The company mainly produced cassiterite from the Keystone-Hill City area. Another mine in the town, The Good Luck Mine, mined tungsten. In December 1892, the Grand Island & Wyoming Central Railroad built a line running from the town to the tin mill east of Hill City. The mine never became successful, despite shaft and drift mining down to 800 feet. On February 25, 1900, the railroad extended to Keystone, causing the town to grow again. The town included a boarding house, saloon, platform station, and commissary car for railroaders. The town declined when, in June 1917, the railroad leading into the town was removed. This turned Addie Camp into a small farming community. Geography The former site of the town is in Pennington County and is located 2.7 miles east of Hill City. The elevation is 4,892 feet (1,491 m) above sea level. There are only a few ruined houses remaining, which are located on the north side of the former railroad tracks and along an old gravel road.

Originally created by then-executive producer Shane Brennan, the story arc first aired in 2009 during the sixth season of the show and continued into the seventh season. Episodes followed the events that originally led to Ziva's being taken hostage by an Islamic terrorist and the later effects of the event: her relationship with Michael Rivkin, the collapse of her relationship with Tony DiNozzo, Rivkin's death at the hands of Tony and the loss of trust between Ziva and the NCIS team as a result, her leaving NCIS to rejoin Mossad, her captivity and eventual rescue, and the ramifications of the abuse she suffered. Elements of prisoner abuse and torture were used for the storyline, though most of the violence perpetrated against the character takes place off screen; producers avoided depicting explicit torture scenes like those commonly associated with the TV series 24. The portrayal of Ziva's divided loyalties to the United States and Israel during this period attracted attention from several Jewish critics and columnists, who discussed its implications. Specifically, the actions of Ziva's father, Eli David (Michael Nouri), drew widespread debate, and his seeming nonchalant attitude towards his daughter's abuse garnered much criticism for the character. Within the series, it led to her decision to resign from Mossad and apply to become an NCIS agent and an American citizen.  Background  The character of Ziva David was introduced by series creator Donald P. Bellisario in 2005 during the third season of NCIS, which follows a team of government agents who work for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. Chilean-American actress Cote de Pablo was cast to portray the character, who underwent a number of revisions before ultimately being scripted as an Israeli Mossad officer assigned as a liaison to the NCIS team. She is portrayed as having a vibrant personality despite her background as an assassin and being \\"an extremely skilled interrogator, nearly impossible to break\\". Initially rejected by most of the other characters, she is eventually accepted as a member of the NCIS team and as a surrogate daughter figure to team leader Gibbs (Mark Harmon). She also serves as a foil for Special Agent Tony DiNozzo, a former Baltimore homicide cop and \\"wannabe playboy\\" played by Michael Weatherly. From early in Ziva's time on the show producers began to toy with the idea of pairing them romantically, but continued to place a number of obstacles in their way (namely difficult circumstances and other love interests). Ziva's upbringing is alluded in her first few seasons. She is depicted as having a somewhat troubled background with a difficult family history. Her younger sister was killed in a terrorist attack against Israel, and her half-brother Ari Haswari became a Hamas terrorist; she eventually kills him onscreen to prevent him from killing Gibbs. Before de Pablo's first appearance, Ari's father—and thus Ziva's as well—is referred to as \\"Doctor Benjamin Weinstein\\" before \\"the series writing staff later Hebraized Dr. Weinstein's name to Eli David\\". Shane Brennan replaced Bellisario as executive producer in 2007, and in the sixth- season premiere, he simultaneously introduced Ziva's father, Mossad Director Eli David (Michael Nouri), and Mossad Officer Michael Rivkin (Merik Tadros). Their appearances catalyzed the events that lead to Ziva being taken hostage later in the season.  Development  Filming of \\"Legend\\" NCIS writers introduced Merik Tadros' character, Mossad Officer Michael Rivkin, as a potential love interest for Ziva in the sixth-season premiere, \\"Last Man Standing\\". After initial trepidation over how to move forward with the character, and an aborted idea of revising him as a relative of Ziva, executive producer Shane Brennan decided to script what he considered to be a love triangle between Ziva, Tony, and Rivkin for the latter half of the season. The story arc, which was planned to end in a \\"tragic\\" fashion, was set to cover the last four episodes of the year. Brennan began the arc by writing the two-part episode \\"Legend\\" which served as a backdoor pilot episode for the spin-off series, \\"NCIS: Los Angeles\\" featuring the hunt for a terrorist; when Special Agents Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) and Timothy McGee (Sean Murray) fly to Los Angeles to work with the NCIS Office of Special Projects — Los Angeles team to solve the murder of a marine, they discover that the killing is linked to members of a sleeper cell. Rivkin becomes involved and, rather than working with NCIS to apprehend the terrorists, kills the suspects, frustrating the other agents. Back in Washington D.C., Tony starts to question Ziva's loyalty when she defends Rivkin's actions. In a confrontation between the two over Ziva's reluctance to tell Gibbs about her connection to Rivkin, Ziva asks if Tony's suspicions of Rivkin are fuelled by jealousy. It is made evident that Ziva is in a romantic relationship with Rivkin in the closing moments of Part II as the two are seen in bed together. The nature of Ziva's romance with Rivkin became a subject of debate among viewers, and some speculated that it could have been arranged by her father against her will. Tadros opined that \\"Rivkin loves Ziva\\" regardless of the circumstances and acted accordingly from that perspective. Despite this, the relationship becomes more ambiguous in the last two episodes of the season as a security breach at the SECNAV's residence leads to the death of an ICE agent and evidence points to Rivkin. After going to Ziva's apartment to speak to her Tony ends up confronting a drunken Rivkin, resulting in a vicious brawl between them that culminates with Tony being forced to shoot Rivkin in self- defense when Rivkin attempts to stab Tony with a piece of glass. Despite Ziva's efforts, Rivkin ultimately succumbs to his wounds and dies. The killing, and the ensuing events, generated some controversy among viewers. On screen, it causes a rift between Tony and Ziva, as well as a violent confrontation between the two in the season finale. Cote de Pablo described Tony's actions as \\"almost unforgivable\\" from her character's perspective despite their being in self-defense and stated, \\"I think sometimes when people make mistakes, they can be impulsive and judge someone on one particular thing. Ziva isn't overreacting—Tony did kill someone who was a big part of her life—but, at the time, she couldn't see clearly.\\" NCIS Director Leon Vance (Rocky Carroll) agrees to a request from Eli and brings the involved parties to Israel. Eli interrogates Tony and accuses him of killing Rivkin out of jealously, a motivation that Michael Weatherly voiced to have been plausible. Tony, in turn, accuses him of ordering Rivkin to seduce Ziva in order to keep an eye on her, which he does not deny. Eli confronts Ziva about her divided loyalties between NCIS and Mossad, and after telling Gibbs that she no longer trusts Tony and feels unable to work with him, Ziva stays in Israel and returns to the Mossad as a full-time operative. She takes Rivkin's place on the Kidon Unit, embarking a mission to assassinate Saleem Ulman (Omid Abtahi), the leader of a terrorist training camp in Somalia. With Ziva back at Mossad, her position at NCIS is terminated and the Major Case Response Team is reduced to three active members: Gibbs, DiNozzo and McGee. Gibbs confronts Vance about the turn of events, insisting that he still trusts Ziva because of her choice to save him by killing her brother four years earlier. In response, Vance claims that she had only done so because her father had ordered to. The final moments of the episode show her to have been taken hostage and tortured by Saleem. The search for and rescue of Ziva was written into the seventh season premiere, but rather than show her in captivity, the writers decided to script the episode from Tony's point of view. This allowed them to shock the audience by opening the episode with Tony strapped to the interrogation chair, rather than Ziva, as well as keep viewers wondering about Ziva's fate. Brennan relayed, \\"You'll think you know what's going on, but then you'll go, 'Am I seeing things? What just happened?'\\" Within the episode, Tony, under the influence of truth serum, recounts to Saleem the events that occurred during the four months since Ziva's disappearance: the team at first attempted to replace Ziva without success. After becoming concerned about her continued lack of communication, they hacked into Mossad's database and learned that she had been put on the assignment to find and kill Saleem. Gibbs then informed them that the Damocles, the ship the Mossad team had taken, had sunk in a storm and that there were no survivors. Tony subsequently became despondent for some time until deciding that they needed to avenge Ziva's death by killing Saleem. This led to him and McGee intentionally being taken captive and interrogated upon locating the camp through the shipment of the fictional drink, \\"Caf-Pow!\\". In present day, he concludes that Ziva is \\"not replaceable\\". \\"Caf-Pow!\\", the fictional drink used to locate the camp where Ziva is held hostage. An infuriated Saleem demands the locations and identities of all other NCIS operatives in the area, threatening to execute a hostage if they refuse to cooperate. To Tony's shock and relief, Saleem brings a bound Ziva into the cell, who is very much alive. Tension is still evident between Tony and Ziva after the events of their last meeting, even as Tony informs Ziva that he \\"couldn't live without her\\" (something that is later confirmed to have been reciprocated when Ziva's diaries are discovered in Season 16 episode 'She'). Tony tells a despondent Ziva that they have an escape plan, and Gibbs kills Saleem before he can harm either captive. The camp is then raided by Navy SEALs. In the closing moments of the episode, Ziva returns to NCIS with the team and is welcomed back in the office as Tony stares at her from across the room. Subsequent episodes center on her recovery and integration back into the team. The other characters are at first uncertain of her allegiances, and Ziva herself suffers from the trauma of what was done to her during captivity. \\"Things are different for her with everyone,\\" de Pablo explained. \\"When she returns, her loyalty is questioned - but, in this season, it will become very clear that she sees NCIS as her family and that her loyalty is really with this family, as opposed to her blood family in Israel.\\" McGee is perhaps the most welcoming of Ziva's return to the team, though he seems sceptical of Ziva's insistence that the past is behind her as she continually avoids speaking to Tony. She has a more difficult reunion with Abby, who (while happy to see Ziva) confronts her angrily about the breakdown of hers and Tony's relationship that led to her leaving NCIS and the accusations Tony faced about his motivations for killing Rivkin. After several awkward encounters, Ziva and Tony finally have a heart- to-heart in the men's bathroom where Ziva apologises for questioning his motives and thanks him for saving her life and the two tentatively repair their relationship. When confronted by Gibbs, Ziva assures him that she had in fact killed Ari to save his life. However, Gibbs continues to distance himself emotionally from her. Producers used the storyline as an opportunity for Ziva to resign from Mossad and apply to become a full-time NCIS agent and American citizen, solidifying her presence at the agency. Brennan had the fourth episode of the season, \\"Good Cop, Bad Cop\\", scripted to in effect \\"[fill] in the blanks\\" left between the season finale and premiere. In it, the team discovers that Damocles did not sink in a storm but rather was abandoned after a shootout resulted in the entire crew and one member of the Mossad team being killed. Flashbacks are threaded through the episode, mostly set on the Damocles, showing that Ziva had befriended a U.S. Marine deserter-turned- freelance-agent on board who was among those killed and that Eli later ordered her to continue on the mission despite the risks making her death almost inevitable. Rather than risk the remaining members of her team being killed, as they were both injured in the shooting, she opted to continue alone and as a result was taken hostage. She becomes a suspect for the marine's death when Eli, in an attempt to prevent her from leaving Mossad, orders her former team leader, Malachi Ben Gidon, who had been on the mission with her, to accuse her of being responsible for the killing. After she is proven innocent, Gibbs angrily states that Ziva is \\"off limits\\" to Eli. They reconcile, with Ziva relaying the rest of what happened up to being taken captive. Gibbs then whispers something in her ear and kisses her forehead as she breaks down crying. Mark Harmon explained that Gibbs, despite being \\"a huge fan of hers\\" and the character who \\"perhaps cares the most\\" about Ziva, had to be wary of her in the beginning due to the question of loyalty. He improvised the final moments of the characters' reconciliation, and what Gibbs whispered to her became a subject of discussion among viewers. Likewise, de Pablo's reaction to it was not scripted either. Harmon declined to divulge what was said, stating, \\"That's our secret.\\" These events propelled the idea of Gibbs as a surrogate father figure to Ziva, marking the first time it was verbally acknowledged within the series.Ziva calls Gibbs \\"the closest thing [she has] to a father\\" in \\"Reunion\\", the second episode of Season 7. Following \\"Good Cop, Bad Cop\\", Ziva's attempts to gain American citizenship became the main subplot while her captivity is only mentioned in passing throughout the rest of Season 7 and into Season 8. To assure the audience that the seriousness of the character's trauma had not been overlooked, a February episode had her briefly discuss the experience with Tony. \\"In true NCIS fashion, it's never quite addressed...\\" de Pablo said. \\"The way it was written was sort of glazed over, but it was so there. We're constantly being bombarded with new information, or else the characters just wouldn't grow or go anywhere.\\" Ziva is uncomfortable when Tony recommends picking the lock of a warehouse to search it without a warrant, reasoning that doing so would help them solve the case more quickly. She explains that when she was in Somalia, Saleem would regularly attempt to justify his crimes by claiming that he committed them to protect his way of life. Afterwards, the subject is alluded to during specific cases, such as when the team deals with a rape victim at the end of Season 7 and an abused wife in the middle of Season 8. In the latter case, Head Medical Examiner Ducky Mallard (David McCallum) suggests that Gibbs have Ziva be the one to confront the woman, saying, \\"Agent David has been through things you and I can't even imagine, and she knows what it's like to be controlled.\\" Michael Nouri was brought back to guest star as Eli David during the eighth season, and the consequences of his actions are addressed. Ziva is able to forgive him somewhat, and he tries to reach a full reconciliation in Season 10's \\"Shabbat Shalom\\". However, he is killed in a targeted shooting before he is able to make peace with his daughter, greatly devastating Ziva and prompting her to embark on a campaign of revenge against the man responsible: Ilan Bodnar.  Use of torture  Ziva's ordeal in Somalia included being tortured by Saleem and his men, but the producers avoided depicting it graphically. Shane Brennan wrote a cliffhanger for the season finale that briefly shows her in the aftermath of an evidently brutal interrogation; in it, she is limp and tied to a chair, bloody and bruised. Makeup specialists were able to use a significant amount of cosmetics on de Pablo to make her face \\"nearly unrecognizable\\". The torturer, later identified as Saleem, casually returns to her cell, rips off her Star of David pendant, and demands that she tell him what she knows about NCIS. She does not appear again until her rescue in the Season 7 premiere, where she is hooded, \\"ready to die\\", and unable to walk on her own. Tony and McGee are both later captured by Saleem on purpose as part of the operation to take down the terrorist prison camp. They suffer an initial beating on being taken hostage, but neither are shown being subjected to torture for information. As the entire premiere is set during Tony's interrogation, NCIS writers opted to script Saleem as injecting Tony with truth serum as a means of obtaining information from him. Glue, which tightens the skin, was put on the actors' lips to effectively make all three characters look sunburned and dehydrated. The specifics of Ziva's abuse are not discussed following her rescue, and, within the series, the other characters only refer to it vaguely. For example, Vance tells Gibbs that \\"Saleem's men put a world of hurt on her\\" and Ducky states that \\"she went through far more than [they] originally suspected\\". Though an episode was filmed to clear some of the questions by showing the events that led up to her captivity, it did not delve into her time as a hostage and de Pablo later confirmed that the ambiguity of what had happened during those four months was intentional. Viewers began to speculate that Ziva had been raped while in captivity and questioned whether the plot was too dark for a primetime drama to explore in depth. De Pablo did not comment on the subject of her character's ordeal except to affirm that Saleem and his men did \\"bad things\\" to Ziva and to suggest that she had suppressed her feelings regarding the trauma in its aftermath.  Impact and significance  = Personality of Ziva David = When first introduced to the series, Ziva is \\"a cocky, young kid who thinks she knows it all and thinks that nothing can really touch her [or] beat her\\". She maintains this demeanor over the next several seasons despite some of the hardships she endures, such as killing her brother and seeing a love interest die from radiation poisoning. During the summer prior to the seventh season, NCIS producers divulged that Ziva would be \\"a changed woman\\" after her experiences in Somalia. This manifests in her being written as a softer, more subdued character, and, in the words of Cote de Pablo, \\"more inclined to listen before acting out\\". While it has been suggested that these aspects made her more likeable, the changes to her personality were not universally welcomed, and Jewish critics expressed concern about the choice to \\"Americanize\\" the only Israeli regular on Western television. De Pablo herself preferred the more wild and reckless version of Ziva and eventually began to request that she be allowed to return to some of her pre-Somalia behavior. Gary Glasberg, who took over as executive producer for Shane Brennan in 2011, gave her that opportunity in the latter half of the tenth season, which focused on Ziva's attempts to get revenge for her father's assassination. = Eli David = The actions of Eli David, both before and after Ziva's captivity, and the extent of their reflection on Israel and Mossad as a whole became a controversial matter during the course of the storyline. On a moral level, viewers were unnerved by the idea of him instructing Michael Rivkin, a Mossad officer, to engage in a sexual relationship with his daughter \\"to exploit [her] liaison position with NCIS, and perhaps to breed him a grandchild\\". The situation was made more sordid when the new season revealed that Eli had ordered her to continue on her assignment, even after it became clear that her chances of survival were slim; to make matters worse, he failed to rescue his daughter after she had been taken captive by the Somali terrorists. Rabbi Elliot B. Gertel wrote: Harvard academic Eitan Kensky also weighed in on the matter: Cote de Pablo, who has been to Israel, considered Eli to be a sympathetic character despite his transgressions, explaining, \\"These characters are able to justify [their actions] because they come from a country that's at war.\\" However, she also considered Ziva's anger to be justifiable as well, as her father \\"[sent] her away on, basically, what I would call a suicide mission\\". Within the series, Ziva is able to partially reconcile with Eli and reach an \\"unspoken forgiveness\\" for him in the eighth season, but the show's writers did not begin to redeem his character until shortly before his death in the tenth- season episode \\"Shabbat Shalom\\". = Diplomatic relations between Israel and the United States = During the first few seasons, storylines related to Israel focus on the \\"peculiar arrangement\\" between the agencies \\"in which the brilliant daughter of the head of Mossad (Ziva David) has been embedded in the American NCIS\\". For example, the Season 4 premiere involves a plot surrounding Iranian agents framing Ziva, and by extension Israel, for the murder of two FBI agents and a terrorist in their custody. Situations are made more complicated due to her being \\"stigmatized as the (half) sister of a Hamas terrorist killer\\". In general, the show avoids creating black-and-white portrayals of the Israeli people; Mossad agents are depicted as effective with justified motivations, but the series has introduced \\"bad\\" Israelis, most prominently a rogue Mossad officer who participates in the framing of Ziva in Season 4. Ziva herself is a sympathetic figure who is \\"unashamedly Jewish\\" and proud of being Israeli, though she is often more ruthless than her colleagues at NCIS. The captivity storylines took a different route by using the characters of Ziva and Michael Rivkin to symbolize the \\"two Israels American policy makers have faced over the years\\". Ziva is \\"the cooperative and quiet Israeli, who has the technical and personal skills to be of enormous assistance in achieving the mission\\" while Rivkin is \\"bright and pro-American, but in this case tough, aggressive, thinks he knows what is best for the United States better than the Americans, is sly and wily, and he doesn't heed the advice of his American counterparts\\". Both are received differently by the American agents—Ziva is respected and trusted by her colleagues; Rivkin is an object of suspicion. Steven L. Spiegel, Director of the Center for Middle East Development and Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), drew parallels between their interactions with their American counterparts and those of prominent Israeli politicians. Ziva, he reasoned, could be likened to Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Rabin, or Ehud Olmert in that she is able to agree with the American agencies on a more basic, fundamental level. Rivkin, he continued, was more like Yitzhak Shamir. NCIS writers continued to present the Israeli personalities as capable and justified, though Spiegel suggested that they \\"[were] too affected by their tragic past\\".  Reception  The first four of the arc's eight episodes average between 16.20 and 16.72 million viewers while the last four all maintained over 20 million following their broadcast. Despite the controversial aspects, the storyline received generally positive reviews, with it being called \\"harrowing\\" and \\"fantastic\\". Response for \\"Truth or Consequences\\", the seventh season premiere, was particularly favorable, and it was later listed among BuddyTV's \\"10 Best [Tony and Ziva] episodes\\". Allison Waldman from AOL summarized the execution of the characters' search for and rescue of Ziva: Viewers disliked the character of Michael Rivkin, partly due to an attachment to the \\"will they/won't they\\" relationship between Tony and Ziva. Zap2it's Brandon Millman referred to the three of them as \\"the love triangle of death\\". A portion of the audience criticized the writers for not directly confronting what Ziva had endured in captivity, believing that in doing so they had not properly addressed her trauma. When the Season 8 episode focusing on domestic abuse aired, Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic commented, \\"What was most intriguing about the case was not the evidence or the unfolding mystery but the fact that this powerful woman, a Marine martial arts trainer, was an abuse victim. Sounds like someone we know. Ziva opened up to Georgia about similar abuse she suffered and made some inroads, although this could have been extrapolated upon further. It seemed like a prime opportunity for Ziva's character to shine - relating to a suspect similarly strong, powerful, yet vulnerable - but the plot quickly moved in other directions.\\" There were also complaints about the choice to partially rewrite the details of the earlier storyline surrounding Ziva's killing of her brother, which had served as her introduction to the series.  Similar use in NCIS: Los Angeles  Executive producer Shane Brennan left NCIS to focus on its spin-off, NCIS: Los Angeles, in 2011. Two years later, a similar storyline and cliff-hanger featuring the torture of two main characters was used for the fourth season finale. The characters, Sam Hanna (LL Cool J) and Marty Deeks (Eric Christian Olsen), are taken hostage by Isaak Sidorov, a Russian arms dealer who interrogates them for information. Unlike with the original NCIS, Brennan opted to have them tortured onscreen, with Sidorov electrocuting Sam and forcing a dentist drill into Deeks' mouth. The choice to include the scene drew criticism; a number of viewers were disturbed by the torture and accused the producers of engaging in gratuitous violence. In response to complaints, Carla Day from TV Fanatic wrote an article naming several instances in which television shows featured storylines that included torture, among them Ziva's captivity storyline. She concluded that what was shown was \\"just enough to get the point across without overdoing it\\".

The school primarily serves the Charedi Jewish community of Stamford Hill. The school has been rated \\"inadequate\\" by Ofsted for the highly restrictive education it provided to its pupils. The Charedi community does not have access to television, the Internet, or other media, and members of the community aim to lead modest lives governed by the codes of Torah observance. In 2008, it emerged that nine pupils, supported by their parents, had refused to sit a Key Stage 3 Shakespeare test on The Tempest because they felt the character of Shylock in The Merchant of Venice was anti-semitic. There have also been recurring controversies at the school due to failures to teach sex education, the theory of evolution, or various aspects of British history. History The school was founded in 1942 as an independent school with separate sections for boys and girls, and with junior and senior departments. The girls' senior department became a voluntary aided school in September 2005. At this time, the school moved into new accommodation. Several figures attended the formal opening of the new school building, including Tony Blair, Lord Levy, Gerald Ronson, and Richard Desmond. In 2007, the school was top of the Department for Education's school's \\"value-added\\" scoring system for pupil progress. In October 2014, the school was downgraded from \\"Outstanding\\" to \\"Good\\" in its ratings by the Ofsted inspectorate, following a no-notice inspection.http://hackneycitizen.co.uk/2014/10/31/yesodey-hatorah- stamford-hill-school-defiant-exam-question-redaction-ofsted-visit/ In 2014, the Oxford, Cambridge, and RSA (OCR) Exam board, having conducted an investigation into alleged exam malpractice, concluded that the school had redacted (deleted) questions involving the evolution of species on GCSE science exam questions. Ofqual subsequently ruled that blocking out exam questions is malpractice, and, accordingly, not permissible. However, it was later revealed that OCR had privately agreed that the school could advise students not to answer particular questions if they \\"need to do this in view of their religious beliefs\\". It was downgraded to \\"inadequate\\" in 2018, due to not following the national curriculum, limiting pupils' access to knowledge, poor governance, poor quality teaching, lack of safeguarding, lack of respect for diversity or promotion of tolerance, and failures to meet statutory requirements to equip pupils for adulthood in British society. The school's then-principal, Rabbi Abraham Pinter (who died in April 2020), said in 2015 that few students go to university because \\"there isn't the environment for Haredi girls to do that\\", and that \\"Our experience is that the better educated girls turn out to be the most successful mothers. For us, that's the most important role a woman plays.\\" In 2018, the school admitted censoring sections of GCSE textbooks to remove mentions of homosexual people and examples of women socialising with men. Ofsted found further censorship when it reviewed the school, as well as other systemic failures. It rated the school \\"Inadequate\\", and recommended it be put into \\"special measures\\".

The 2011 breakfast is shown. A pancake breakfast is a public meal attached to many festivals, religious celebrations, and community events which involves volunteers cooking large quantities of pancakes and other hot breakfast foods for the general public, often for free or for a nominal charge if the event is a fundraiser. Throughout Christendom, the tradition of pancake breakfasts is carried out on Shrove Tuesday, the last day of Shrovetide and the day preceding the start of the somber season of Lent, as many Christians give up fatty foods as their Lenten sacrifice. The tradition is especially noted in Western Canada, where it is associated with the region's cattle ranching history, presumably because cowboys would have been fed pancakes from a chuckwagon while on the trail. This mainly Canadian tradition appears to be related to the tradition in the neighboring United States in which various groups use pancake breakfasts as a means to raise funds for schools, churches, hospitals, charities, non-profits, volunteer fire departments, or civic organizations. Alberta In Alberta, Canada, the tradition is also closely associated with the major summer fairs and exhibitions of each town and city, including most famously K-Days in Edmonton, and the Calgary Stampede in that city. The Calgary Stampede, Canada's largest rodeo, had been associated with pancake breakfasts since 1923 when a local rancher began serving pancakes from his camp stove during the festivities to anyone who came by. The tradition soon became for local businesses and charities across Calgary and Edmonton to host breakfasts for their employees, customers, and others during the Stampede and K-Days. Likewise with Westerner Days in Red Deer, etc. Besides the fairs and rodeos, pancakes are also widely served on Canada Day, including at the Alberta Legislature. Green Party of Canada leader Elizabeth May at a 2008 Calgary Stampede pancake breakfast There has also been a long connection between these breakfast events and politics. The Premier of Alberta annually hosts pancake breakfasts at both K-Days and the Calgary Stampede which are frequently attended by many other politicians, keen to be seen by the public at such events. And politicians are also the main volunteers behind the Canada Day breakfast hosted by the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. Likewise, most small town fairs in Alberta feature a pancake breakfast hosted by the mayor and councilors and other local notables. These events are now part of a \\"barbecue circuit\\" of summer community events that Canadian politicians are expected to attend. Over time, the pancake breakfasts associated with the Calgary Stampede have evolved into large affairs in which big international corporate sponsors tried to out do each other and sometime overshadows the smaller breakfasts. Many large deals are sometime made at these breakfasts. More than 100 different breakfasts might be hosted during this time period. Breakfasts at the Stampede is important enough for the Canadian Prime Minister and national leaders of the other important political parties to attend as a server at some of these breakfasts. One of the largest breakfasts is held annually at the Chinook Centre in which 60,000 people are served. Pancake breakfasts are also closely associated with Canadian football fan culture, especially around the Alberta teams. Both Calgary and Edmonton fan organizations host pancake breakfasts during Grey Cup week festivities each year. The tradition began at the 1948 championship when hundreds of Calgary Stampeders fans descended on Toronto for their team's first appearance in the game. Bringing chuckwagons and horses, the fans organized a Stampede week style pancake breakfast for bewildered Torontonians. According to historian Hugh Dempsey, \\"[t]he Grey Cup was just another game until Calgary went down to Toronto with chuckwagons and everything and turned it into an event.\\" Free pancake breakfasts are now offered in the Grey Cup host city anytime Calgary is invited to the Grey Cup match.

He also introduced the term \\"Code Stroke\\" as an in-hospital method for summoning specialists to the stroke patient bedside.  Early life  Gomez was born in Holguín, Cuba and emigrated in 1965, his family settling in Caracas, Venezuela. There, he attended the Fray Luis Amigo and Santo Tomas de Villanueva catholic schools. Later, in 1981, he received a M.D. from the Universidad Central del Este in San Pedro de Macorís, Dominican Republic, and immediately emigrated to the United States to continue postgraduate education in neurology at Saint Louis University  Career  In 1986, having completed his neurology residency, he became the founding director of the Saint Louis University stroke center, incorporating a neurovascular ultrasound laboratory dedicated to the application of the new diagnostic technique of Transcranial Doppler. This work earned the first EME Transcranial Doppler Research Award in 1990, and caught the attention of Sylvia N. Souers, widow of the late Admiral Sidney W. Souers, who later agreed to donate a portion of her estate to the creation of the Souers Stroke Institute, which Gomez directed until 1995. In 1995, he was recruited by the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and became the founding director of its Comprehensive Stroke Center, a post that he held until 2003. He then switched to private practice, maintained an adjunct appointment to the UAB School of Public Health, and remained the principal neurology investigator of the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS), a federally funded project intended to uncover the underlying causes for the existence of the Stroke Belt. In 2015 he led the team that secured Primary Stroke Center certification by The Joint Commission for Brookwood Medical Center and, in 2016, he became Professor of Neurology and Neurosurgery at Loyola University Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine. At that institution, he also was Vice-Chairman of the Department of Neurology, and Medical Director of the Neuroendovascular Surgery Program at Loyola University Medical Center. In 2019, he joined the faculty of the department of neurology at the University of Missouri School of Medicine in Columbia, Missouri, continuing to practice vascular and interventional neurology within the University of Missouri Health Care System. = Neuroimaging and Interventional neurology = He joined the American Society of Neuroimaging (ASN) in the mid-1980s, serving in its Board of Directors for over ten years, and as its president between 2007–2009. He was instrumental in the education and certification of neurologists in diagnostic vascular ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and angiography. Following his seminal endovascular work in St. Louis, upon moving to UAB, he continued to collaborate closely with interventional cardiologists and radiologists, becoming a member of the team that largely influenced the application of carotid artery stenting for stroke prevention. He also worked closely with interventional neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons of the Instituto Nacional de Neurología y Neurocirugía in Mexico City, exchanging working visits several times each year, and leading to a productive interaction in the endovascular management of cerebral aneurysms. The 1990s witnessed an interventional turf war between the three major specialties with stakes in the practice of neuroendovascular procedures, namely neurology, neurosurgery and neuroradiology. During this period, Gomez took part on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) in negotiating a common educational pathway and, as a byproduct, vascular neurology became an accredited subspecialty, as well as a prerequisite for neurologists training in interventional neuroradiology. His work on mechanical neuroendovascular rescue of acute ischemic stroke preceded the approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of devices specifically designed for this purpose, culminating in the widespread acceptance of endovascular thrombectomy as an urgent treatment strategy in these cases. = Urgent and intensive stroke care = In the early 1990s he coined the phrase Time is Brain!, as an argument for the need to expedite the treatment of stroke victims at a time when this was not the norm, and also introduced one of the first experiences using a \\"Code Stroke\\" system for managing stroke patients, in parallel to the existing procedures for treating patients with cardiac arrest. He promoted the use of hypothermia for the management of critically ill neurologic patients, including stroke, a subject highlighted in a 2001 article and television piece by CNN. He partnered with the Birmingham Regional Emergency Medical Services System (BREMSS) to construct a regional stroke transportation system that was unique in the country. The product served as a model for national guidelines. It became operational in 2000 and, for the first time, used a dedicated computerized system to link dedicated stroke centers within the six counties that surround the city of Birmingham, allowing them to work in a symbiotic way. The system included a process for certifying stroke centers based upon a set of criteria, anteceding the current stroke center certification process by the Joint Commission.  Military service  In 1986 he joined the U.S. Army Medical Corps, becoming a member of the Saint Louis University Medical Detachment of the 21st General Hospital, 102nd Army Reserve Command (ARCOM). In December 1990, he was called to active duty in support of Operation Desert Storm, and was honorably discharged in 1994.  Honors and awards  Gomez was the commencement speaker for the graduation ceremonies at Universidad Central del Este in 1988 and is a member of the Phi Kappa Phi and Beta Gamma Sigma honor societies in business. He has been listed in several editions of Best Doctors in America. In 1990, he was awarded the first Eden Medical Electronics (EME) Transcranial Doppler Research Award for his work on cerebral perfusion during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and, in 2000, the Birmingham Regional EMS (BREMSS) awarded him the R. Floyd Yarborough EMS Award for being instrumental in organizing the care of stroke patients in the counties that surround the city of Birmingham, Alabama. He then received the Interventional Pioneer Award by the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology (SVIN) during their inaugural meeting in 2007.  Business degree  In 2006, he completed and earned the degree of Master in Business Administration (MBA) from the Physician Executive MBA (PEMBA) program at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.  Personal life  He married Sandra Maria Lopez Quiroga in 1981, but they divorced in 2007 after having had two children.  Publications (books only)  * Tegeler CH, Babikian VL and Gomez CR.

Increasing resistance to cephalosporins among Gram-(−) bacterial pathogens, especially among hospital-acquired infections, results in part from the production of β-lactamase enzymes that deactivate these antibiotics.

He played college football at Indiana University from 1944 to 1947 and helped lead the Indiana Hoosiers football team to the Big Ten Conference championship in 1945. In April 1948, he signed with the Detroit Lions, becoming the first African-American signed by the team. He played for the Lions during the 1948 and 1949 seasons and spent the next four years serving in the United States Air Force. He later spent more than 30 years, as a professor and head baseball coach, at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro, North Carolina. Early years and family Groomes was born in Trenton, New Jersey, in 1927. He was the son of Malachi and Margaret Groomes, both of whom were natives of Virginia. At the time of the 1930 United States Census, Groomes' father was employed as a fireman for a gas company. The family was living in Trenton's fifth ward and consisted of Groomes, his parents, three step-brothers, four step-sisters, and two brothers.Census entry for Malachi and Margaret Groomes and family. Son Mell age 3 years and one month (born approx. March 1927.

Ancestry.com. 1930 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Groomes played halfback on the Trenton Central High School football team. He was also a competitor in track and field and set the New Jersey high school records in the high jump and the broad jump. In 1954, Groomes' younger brother, Ronald Groomes, was the first African-American to enroll in the New Jersey State Police Academy. Indiana University Groomes in October 1947: \\"READY FOR HIS MEDICINE. Mel Groomes gets ready for the plunge as Bob Ravensberg tries to bring down a potential Badger tackler in the Hoosier homecoming.\\" (Photo and caption from the 1948 Arbutus) Groomes enrolled at Indiana University in 1944 where he played college football and was also a member of the track and field team, specializing in the high jump. He set an Indiana freshman record in the high jump at 6 feet, 4 inches, which record stood until 1959. Groomes was also a member of the football team from 1944 to 1947. He was a third-stringer in 1944, but established himself as the team's starting wingback during the 1945 season. Groomes and fellow African-American halfback George Taliaferro helped lead the 1945 Indiana team to the school's first-ever Big Ten Conference football championship. In the first game of the 1945 Big Ten Conference schedule, Groomes had a 54-yard touchdown reception in a 13-7 upset over Michigan. Indiana became a leader in integrating college football in the 1940s. The 1947 team included eight African-American players, giving it \\"more colored gridmen than any other large squad in the country.\\" That year, the Hoosiers upset the Ohio State Buckeyes 7-0, with the key play in the game coming on a pass from Taliaferro to Groomes that gained 63 yards. Groomes also played defensive back, and Indiana coach Bo McMillin in 1947 called Groomes \\"the finest defensive back\\" in the Big Nine Conference.The conference now known as the Big Ten had only nine members following the departure of the University of Chicago in 1946. The conference remained at nine members until Michigan State University joined in 1949. See History of the Big Ten Conference for more details. Detroit Lions In 1948, Bo McMillin left Indiana to take over as the head coach and general manager of the Detroit Lions. One of McMillin's first personnel moves was signing Groomes to a contract with the Lions on April 17, 1948. At the time, only one other NFL team, the Los Angeles Rams, had an African-American player, and Groomes was the first African-American to sign a contract with the Detroit Lions.Charlie Sanders, Charlie Sanders Tales from the Detroit Lions, p. 25. (Bob Mann signed with the Lions one week later.) During the 1948 season, Groomes wrote a series of articles, \\"How It Feels To Be A Rookie In The National Football League\\", for a Detroit newspaper. Groomes made his debut for the Lions on September 22, 1948, in the first game of the 1948 season against the Los Angeles Rams in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Bob Mann and Groomes both played in the game, becoming the first African-Americans to appear in a game for the Lions. Early in the game, Groomes fumbled a ball inside the Detroit 30-yard line, resulting in a Rams' touchdown. The Rams won the game, 44-7. Groomes suffered a broken wrist during the 1948 season, limiting him to six games. Groomes appeared in three more games for the Lions during the 1949 season. In his career with the Lions, Groomes caught five passes for 51 yards and one touchdown. Military service In 1950, Groomes entered the United States Air Force. He played football for the football team from Bolling Field in Washington, D.C., for three years from 1951 to 1953. Coaching career After being discharged from the military, Groomes was hired in August 1954 as the backfield coach for the football team at Howard University, historically black university located in Washington, D.C. In 1955 Groomes was hired as an assistant football coach at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, a historically black college in Greensboro, North Carolina. In 1955, he also became the head baseball coach at North Carolina A&T.; Groomes remained at the school until he retired in 1987. In 31 years as the school's head baseball coach, he compiled a record of 471–224. Groomes also served as a professor and was instrumental in developing the North Carolina A&T;'s Health, Physical Education, and Recreation department. Family and death Groomes and his wife, Juanita Bradley, had three daughters. Melita Rene was born in Philadelphia in May 1952, Deborah Lynn was born March 1955, and Glenna Marie was born February 1959. In 19XX, Mel and Juanita divorced. Mel married Jean in 19XX. They had a daughter, Majeana, in MMM YYYY. In September 1997, Groomes died at age 70 at the Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital in Greensboro.

Life  Gustav Langenscheidt was the son of Johann Ludwig Langenscheidt, a decorator, and his wife Sophie Caroline Schwartze. After graduating from high school in 1850 Langenscheidt started a commercial apprenticeship, which he completed in two years. Between 1851 and the spring of 1853 Langenscheidt traveled to almost all the neighboring countries of Germany and covered around 7000 kilometers on foot and by stagecoach. After returning to Germany he joined the army in summer of 1853. During his time in the military Langenscheidt extensively studied the different ways of learning the French language. In 1857, he married Pauline Hartmann (1832 – 1903) in Berlin and had two daughters and four sons, including the writer and publisher Paul Langenscheidt and Carl Langenscheidt, who later became his successor. Gustav Langenscheidt died on November 11, 1895, at the age of nearly 63 years. He was first buried in the old St. Matthew's Cemetery in Schöneberg, and then in his final resting place in the family grave in West Stahnsdorf in 1935. The family's mausoleum is in Department D of the cemetery.  Work  Spanish, which uses the Toussaint-Langenscheidt method Together with Charles Toussaint Langenscheidt developed a self-learning method, which he published in 1856 under the title Unterrichtsbriefe zur Erlernung der französischen Sprache (\\"Teaching letters for learning the French language\\"). Langenscheidt had copied the idea of such a teaching method and especially the sales strategy of William Cobbett. Since no publisher was interested in this teaching work, Langenscheidt himself established a publishing house on October 1, 1856. These correspondence lessons became very popular and were widely read, so today Langenscheidt can be considered the \\"Father of distance education.\\" In 1857 Langenscheidt was appointed chief writer of the 11th Infantry Brigade in Berlin. In 1861, together with Carl Dalen and Henry Lloyd, Langenscheidt published \\"English lessons letters\\" (similar in structure to the French). From 1867 Langenscheidt Publishing Group had its own printing press. From 1869 Langenscheidt worked with Karl Sachs and Césaire Villatte on the Encyklopädisches französisch-deutsches und deutsch-französisches Wörterbuch (\\"Encyclopedic French-German and German-French dictionary\\") and was finally able to publish it in 1880. In 1874, Langenscheidt was awarded the title of professor. In 1891, in close collaboration with Eduard Muret and Daniel Sanders, he started working on the English equivalent, the Encyklopädisches englisch-deutsches und deutsch-englisches Wörterbuch (\\"Encyclopedic English- German and German-English dictionary\\"). Langenscheidt did not live to see its publication; his son Carl, his successor, published it in 1901. The Toussaint- Langenscheidt method is based on the language teaching methodology of James Hamilton and Jean Joseph Jacotot. The revolutionary aspect of this method was that the focus was no longer on grammar, but on reading and communication. Langenscheidt and Toussaint created a new phonetic alphabet for the representation of pronunciation in order to facilitate learning. This was used until the Second World War, after which it was replaced by the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).

However, it was less active against Gram-negative pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with MIC90 values of 32, 16, and 32 g/ml, respectively. The new drug also is effective against C.difficile isolates that are resistant to other quinolones, and is more potent than levofloxacin or moxifloxacin.

In the United States, it was approved in October 2018, for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute skin and skin structure infections. In vitro studies In vitro studies have shown that omadacycline has activity against a broad range of Gram-positive and select Gram-negative pathogens. Omadacycline has potent in vitro activity against Gram-positive aerobic bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-resistant and multi-drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Omadacycline also has antimicrobial activity against common Gram-negative aerobes, some anaerobes, and atypical bacteria such as Legionella and Chlamydia. This activity translated to potent efficacy for omadacycline in an in vivo systemic infection model in mice. Additional in vitro and in vivo studies of omadacycline metabolism, disposition, and drug interactions show that omadacycline is metabolically stable (i.e., it does not undergo significant biotransformation) and neither inhibits nor interacts with metabolizing enzymes or transporters. Mechanism of action The mechanism of action of omadacycline is similar to that of other tetracyclines – inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis. Omadacycline has activity against bacterial strains expressing the two main forms of tetracycline resistance (efflux and ribosomal protection). Clinical trials A phase II study was conducted comparing the safety and efficacy of omadacycline to linezolid for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections. Patients were randomized at 11 sites in the US to receive either omadacycline 100 mg intravenously once daily with an option to transition to 200 mg orally once daily or linezolid 600 mg intravenously twice daily with an option to transition to 600 mg orally twice daily. The results indicated that omadacycline is well tolerated and has the potential to be an effective treatment in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections. In June 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designated the intravenous and oral formulations of omadacycline as a qualified infectious disease product in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. A 650 patient phase III registration study comparing omadacycline to linezolid for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections began in June 2015. Omadacycline met the primary efficacy endpoint of early clinical response with statistical non-inferiority (10% margin) compared to linezolid, and was generally safe and well tolerated. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were gastrointestinal side effects (18.0% for omadacycline vs. 15.8% for linezolid). A 750 patient phase III study comparing omadacycline to moxifloxacin for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia began in November 2015. Omadacycline was statistically non-inferior to moxifloxacin at the early clinical response, 72 to 120 hours after therapy was initiated. In May 2016, a phase Ib study of omadacycline in urinary tract infection was initiated. In August 2016, a second phase III study of omadacycline was initiated in patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, comparing the efficacy and safety of once-daily, oral omadacycline to that of twice-daily, oral linezolid. In July 2017, analysis of the data showed that all of the primary and secondary endpoints required for submission to the FDA and EMA were met. This was the third phase 3 registration study of omadacycline with favorable results. Discovery Omadacycline was invented at Tufts University School of Medicine by a research team led by Mark L. Nelson with Mohamed Ismail while at Tufts and Kwasi Ohemeng and Laura Honeyman at Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Boston. The team applying their chemistry methods to the tetracycline scaffolds created over 3000 new derivatives, leading to the novel third generation compounds omadacycline and sarecycline.

As of 2019 it is recommended only for those in whom alternatives are not an option. It is given by injection into a vein. Common side effects include kidney problems, diarrhea, nausea, and blood pressure changes. Other severe side effects include hearing loss, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, anaphylaxis, and muscle weakness. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Plazomicin works by decreasing the ability of bacteria to make protein. Plazomicin was approved for medical use in the United States in 2018. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses Plazomicin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adults with complicated urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, or Enterobacter cloacae, in patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options. Zemdri is an intravenous infusion, administered once daily. The FDA declined approval for treating bloodstream infections due to lack of demonstrated effectiveness. Plazomicin has been reported to demonstrate in vitro synergistic activity when combined with daptomycin or ceftobiprole versus methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus and against Pseudomonas aeruginosa when combined with cefepime, doripenem, imipenem or piperacillin/tazobactam. It also demonstrates potent in vitro activity versus carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Plazomicin was found to be noninferior to meropenem. History The drug was developed by the biotech company Achaogen. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted fast track designation for the development and regulatory review of plazomicin. The FDA approved plazomicin for adults with complicated UTIs and limited or no alternative treatment options in 2018. Achaogen was unable to find a robust market for the drug, and declared bankruptcy a few months later. A generic version is manufactured by Cipla USA.

Shaw (born October 24, 1943 in Dallas, Texas) is an American environmental health scientist, explorer, ocean conservationist, and author. A Doctor of Public Health, she is a professor in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences at the School of Public Health at the State University of New York at Albany, and Founder/President of the Shaw Institute, a nonprofit scientific institution with a mission to improve human and ecological health through innovative science and strategic partnerships. Shaw is globally recognized for pioneering high-impact environmental research on ocean pollution, climate change, oil spills, and plastics that has fueled public policy over three decades. In 1983, with landscape photographer Ansel Adams, she published Overexposure, the first book to document the health hazards of photographic chemicals. Shaw is credited as the first scientist to show that brominated flame retardant chemicals used in consumer products have contaminated marine mammals and commercially important fish stocks in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. She became the first scientist to dive into the Gulf of Mexico oil slick following the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion to investigate the impacts of chemical dispersants used in response to the spill. Recognized as an outspoken voice on emerging contaminants like plastic, Shaw travels globally to raise awareness on toxic legacy of man-made chemicals and its impact on public health and the environment. An expert in occupational exposure to burning plastic and cancer in firefighters, Shaw was named US Science Liaison to the international Plastic Health Coalition in 2019.  Education and early career  Shaw received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Texas in 1967 with a major in Plan II, an interdisciplinary honors program modeled after the Harvard Society of Fellows Program. Selected for the UT-Chilean Exchange Program in 1964, she spent a year in Chile as a Fulbright Scholar. She earned an MFA degree in Film from Columbia University in 1970, and a doctorate in Public Health/Environmental Health Sciences (Dr.P.H.) from Columbia University's School of Public Health in 1999. In 1980, Ansel Adams commissioned her to write Overexposure, published in 1983 as the first book to document the health hazards of photographic chemicals used in the darkroom. A second edition of the book was published in 1991. Shaw founded the Shaw Institute in Blue Hill, Maine in 1990 following the deaths of 20,000 harbor seals inhabiting polluted waters of northwestern Europe. This wildlife “signal” event was followed by other mass die-offs of marine mammals in polluted marine regions. Advancing understanding of the impacts of toxic chemicals on marine mammal health became the Institute's research focus over the next two decades. The Institute's mission is to protect the environment and people from the effects of harmful exposure in three priority areas: halogenated flame retardants and other persistent organic pollutants (POPs), chemical dispersants used in oil spills, and plastic pollution.  Research  For three decades, Shaw's work has focused on the health effects of environmental chemical exposure in marine wildlife and humans. In 2000, the Shaw Institute began its long-term research focused on marine sentinel species to characterize the extent of contamination of the northwest Atlantic marine ecosystem from Maine to New York. Funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), this region-wide effort has produced a large body of data on a wide range of persistent organic pollutants, including flame retardants, in marine mammals and fish that has placed the region in a global perspective. This work has shown that levels of toxic chemicals, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), in northwest Atlantic harbor seals are among the highest in the world. In 2007, Shaw was credited as the first scientist to show that brominated flame retardant chemicals used in household and consumer products have contaminated marine mammals and fish in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. This information helped support toxics policy reform in the state of Maine when the Legislature banned Deca-BDE from household products as of 2010. That same year, Shaw was lead author on a review paper on halogenated flame retardants, titled Halogenated Flame Retardants: Do the Fire Safety Benefits Justify the Risks?, which challenged the efficacy of these chemicals in preventing fire deaths. It presented a large body of scientific evidence of the negative health effects, including cancer, that are associated with exposure to halogenated flame retardants in consumer products. The paper had national policy implications, laying the groundwork for the San Antonio Statement, which cited the need for regulatory action on halogenated flame retardant chemicals worldwide. It was signed by more than 300 scientists from 30 countries. Shaw's paper and the statement were, in turn, the basis for the Chicago Tribune’s 2012 exposé of the chemical industry’s campaign to market harmful flame retardant chemicals to the American public.  BP Oil Spill  In May 2010, a month after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, Shaw dove into the oil slick to investigate the impact of the chemical dispersant Corexit, which was being used to contain the oil spill. Her findings informed the national debate on the dangers of chemical dispersant use. She maintained that the dispersant-oil mixture was more toxic to wildlife and human health than the oil alone, because of the increased exposure to hydrocarbons in the water column, and the synergistic toxicity of Corexit and oil components combined. Shaw was appointed to the Strategic Sciences Working Group (SSWG), convened by the US Department of the Interior, to assess the consequences of the oil spill and make policy recommendations to federal agencies. In September 2010, she drafted a scientific memo titled “It’s Not About Dose” on behalf of the SSWG stating there is no safe level of exposure to cancer-causing hydrocarbons in oil. The memo warned that the use of Corexit dispersants, in combination with crude oil, would result in long- term damage to wildlife and human health in the Gulf region. The Shaw Institute subsequently launched Gulf EcoTox, an independent investigation into the effects of oil and chemical dispersants in the food web. Shaw predicted the decimation of deep-water coral, species known to be sensitive to the Corexit-oil mixture, and the deaths of dolphins from unavoidable inhalation of the mixture as they surfaced to breathe. Both outcomes have since occurred. She also predicted with certainty the human health crisis in the Gulf today, stating that a scientific review found that “five of the Corexit ingredients are linked to cancer, 33 are associated with skin irritation from rashes to burns, 33 are linked to eye irritation, 11 are or are suspected of being potential respiratory toxins or irritants, and 10 are suspected kidney toxins.” She delivered three TEDx talks discussing the long-term damage to the ecosystem and the impending human health crisis in the Gulf as a result of exposure to the oil-Corexit mixture. She appeared in documentary films on the oil spill, including Animal Planet’s Black Tide: Voices of the Gulf and Green Planet's The Big Fix.  Current work  Dr. Shaw onstage at the Plastic Health Summit in Amsterdam, 2019 The Shaw Institute's research examines the sources, fate, exposure pathways, tissue-specific bioaccumulation/biomagnification, and health effects of organic halogenated chemicals and other toxic man-made chemicals in the environment. The organization's current work focuses on highly exposed populations, including firefighters, to indoor contaminants including flame retardants and carcinogenic combustion by-products that may relate to their elevated rates of cancer. An expert on marine pollution, Shaw currently leads a multinational project with scientists from Sweden, Greenland and Iceland to assess the converging impacts of climate change and flame retardant chemicals on marine mammals from the US Atlantic, Baltic, and Arctic seas. In 2013, Shaw was lead investigator of a study that tested a group of firefighters in San Francisco and found that their blood contains high levels of flame retardants and cancer-causing chemicals such as dioxins and furans, produced by the burning of flame-retarded household materials. The study's findings suggested that chemical exposure during firefighting may carry higher risk for multiple cancers than previously demonstrated. Based on these findings, in 2014, the Institute announced plans for a long-term study of chemical exposure and cancer risk in U.S. firefighters. In 2012 Shaw launched a study into microplastics in the Gulf of Maine that influenced a nationwide ban of microbeads in cosmetics. Shaw Institute scientists lead a 2018 study on the uptake and expulsion of microplastic fibers by blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) in the Gulf of Maine. In 2018, Shaw Institute partnered with the international Plastics Health Coalition in order to advance understanding of the damaging effects of microplastics in the human body and to promote plastic reduction across multiple sectors on a global scale.  Honors and awards  Shaw is a Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellow to U.S. universities and was named a Gulf of Maine Visionary by the Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment in 2007 In May 2011, she received the Society of Woman Geographers’ Gold Medal Award. In March 2012, Shaw received the Explorers Club Citation of Merit Award for her work in ocean conservation. In 2011, she was named “Woman of the Gulf” by Audubon Society Women in Conservation at the Rachel Carson Awards. She was a recipient of the 2012 Next Award from Mainebiz magazine for her work in shaping the future and the economy of Maine.

Her scholarship is in the field of ethnomusicology, where she is known for her studies of Asian American and Thai music. She identifies herself as Chinese-American, Asian-American, and multi-ethnic. Early life and education Wong was born on the East Coast of the US, and now lives in California. She earned her Bachelor of Arts in anthropology and music at the University of Pennsylvania in 1982. Wong later attended the University of Michigan where she earned her master's degree and then her PhD in 1991.  Scholarship  Wong has taught as a Professor of Music at the University of California, Riverside since 1996. She has served as President of the Society for Ethnomusicology, and also founded the Committee on the Status of Women with Elizabeth Tolbert in 1996. Wong is also the president of the Board of Directors for the Alliance for California Traditional Arts. She is committed to her public sector work, and has served on the advisory council for the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage since 2011. Wong's focus is on Asian American issues and activities; she has addressed these issues in curriculum and students’ needs. Wong was nominated to be a member of the National Council on the Humanities by President Barack Obama in December 2015.  Taiko drumming  Wong has studied Taiko, Japanese American drumming, and is part of Satori Daiko, a performing group in Los Angeles. Taiko provides a space that allows women to talk about their performances together and talk about what drumming provides them. The physicality and powerful sounds of Taiko are what moved Wong to discover drumming. She said that music practices, like Taiko, have helped to build community. About 75% of Taiko players are women, most of them Asian American. Wong has said that Asian American women come from family environments where they are encouraged to be quiet and respectful, and Taiko is a way of breaking out of this silence — musically, socially, and politically.  Asian American studies Wong focuses on Asian American performance and the way it intersects with the racial imagination in America. She says, race is very much a part of our lives, America has racist structures that drive it, and looking at race when studying music is a different approach. She used a $10,000 grant from the California Council for the Humanities to help fund the research for the site, www.asianamericanriverside.ucr.edu. She wanted to spread the word about the little-known story of the city's lively Asian community. \\"Asian American Riverside\\" is a resource for local schools and the community. The project will help support interethnic understanding and strengthen community in Riverside. Selected bibliography * Wong's first book is about ritual performance and its implications for the cultural politics of Thai court music and dance in Bangkok in the late twentieth-century. * This book focuses on music and identity by looking at case studies.

He was a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council for 35 years (1866–1901). Holmes was from Ireland and made his money in Victoria from farming, exporting wool, and supplying the gold fields. The family lived in Scotland for some years but Holmes moved to New Zealand. His family followed him years later and they lived for most of their time in Otago, but retired to Wellington. Early life Born in Strabane, County Tyrone, Ireland on 15 September 1817, Holmes received his education in his home town. After school, he was trained in commerce at McFarland's woollen mill in Londonderry. Life in Australia William Street, Melbourne The rightmost building was constructed in 1862 for Holmes White & Co in Lydiard Street, Ballarat. Holmes moved to Australia in 1837 and his first business venture was a stationery shop in Melbourne's Collins Street with William Kerr. The partnership was dissolved at the end of 1841; his business partner would later found The Argus. Holmes took over the running of the stationery shop by himself. In 1843, he was declared insolvent by the courts and the stock was auctioned. It was not until 1845 that he was discharged. For some time, he had a dairy farm called \\"Glencairn\\" in the Barrabool Hills outside of Geelong. On 26 May 1841 at Port Phillip, he married Anne McLean, the daughter of Allan McLean of Strathallan near Echuca. After being burned out in the Black Thursday bushfires on 6 February 1851 and their youngest child dying from the effects, he relocated to Geelong and built up a profitable wool exporting company operating under the style of Holmes, White & Co. He also supplied the gold diggings during the Victorian gold rush. The store of Holmes, White & Co in Melbourne's William Street does not exist any longer, but their premises at 114 Lydiard Street North in Ballarat still stand and are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. Life in Scotland Holmes and his family moved to Scotland in 1854 as there was better medical care available for his wife's poor health. He purchased a large estate in Lasswade near Edinburgh, and became involved in a group which became the New Zealand and Australia Land Company. Life in New Zealand In 1859, he returned to New Zealand on the Pirate as the company's general manager, but also spent time in Victoria to look after business interests there. In 1862, he travelled to England as one of the commissioners for the 1862 International Exhibition. In 1864, he sold his estate in Scotland and moved his family back to New Zealand. At first, they were living at Andersons Bay on Otago Peninsula. They then lived partly at Andersons Bay and partly at Awamoa, near Oamaru in North Otago. He was the owner of large sheep runs both at Awamoa and at Castlerock near Lumsden in Southland. His station at Castlerock was overrun by rabbits in the 1870s, but Holmes managed to get on top of the problem; his son Stuart later gave presentations on how they went about this. Holmes was well known for importing quality stock for breeding, including Clydesdale horses and Cheviot sheep. Holmes was one of the original directors of the Mosgiel Woollen Mill and on retirement from active business, he sold his trading interests to Dalgety, Rattray & Co. In their later years, the Holmes lived in Hawkestone House, Wellington. =Political career= Holmes represented the Oteramika electorate in the Southland Provincial Council from 7 November 1864 to 6 July 1867. He represented the Oreti electorate in Southland on the Otago Provincial Council, after Otago and Southland had reunited, from 31 March 1871 to 22 May 1873. Holmes was a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council from 19 June 1866 until 1901, when he died. Family and death His wife was related to the brothers John and Allan McLean. The Holmes had six children, including the barrister Allan Holmes. Their daughter Katherine was an artist whose work has been collected by the Hocken Library and the Alexander Turnbull Library. A daughter was Isabella, a founder of Dunedin Public Art Gallery. Isabella married George McLean, who served as a member of parliament in the 1860s and 1870s, and became a member of the Legislative Council in 1881. A daughter of Isabella and George McLean married Thomas Wilford. The eldest daughter of the Holmes, Elizabeth, married in Melbourne in 1860. His wife died in 1897, and Holmes died on 27 September 1901 aged 84. He was buried at Karori Cemetery.

The school closed in July 2017, in a phased closure, when the pupils who started in September 2012 completed their GCSE studies, while the younger three year groups were transferred to other schools from September 2016; with Dormston or High Arcal in neighbouring Sedgley being the most popular destinations. The site is now scheduled to be mothballed for three years, re-opening in September 2020 to cater for the likely increase in secondary school pupils living in Coseley following the construction of a new housing development on the former Bean Industries and Newey Goodman sites in the south of the town. History The Coseley School opened in September 1968 as a secondary modern school from children aged between 11 and 16 years, although building work delays meant that pupils had to be bussed to classrooms at Ellowes Hall School for a term until the buildings in Ivyhouse Lane were ready for occupation in January 1969. The age range was reorganised to 12-16 in September 1972, when the school took in the remaining pupils at nearby Mount Pleasant Senior School. Coseley converted to comprehensive status in September 1975, and in September 1990 became an 11–16 school. Further expansion took place at this time when Coseley took in approximately half of the pupils and staff from Mons Hill School in Dudley, which had closed that summer. In March 2008, Dudley Council's cabinet member for children's services claimed that there was a \\"50/50 chance\\" of Coseley School (or possibly either nearby Dormston or High Arcal) closing within the next 10 years. This came after 147 pupils leaving primary school in 2007 put Coseley as their first choice when it had a maximum of 195 places available. This would have left Coseley without a secondary school for the first time since the 19th century. However, the council later stated that no more secondary schools were scheduled for closure in the borough, following the closure of Cradley High School at Halesowen in 2008, and the phased closure of Pensnett High School from 2010 to 2012. In May 2016, Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council announced that The Coseley School would be closed due to falling pupil numbers and low pupil achievement. The school finally closed in July 2017, with all but the oldest pupils in the school being transferred to other schools from September 2016.

Matsumoto was born in Tokyo to an ex-samurai family. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University, was accepted into the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce as a bureaucrat, before returning to Tokyo Imperial University as an assistant professor in 1903. He travelled to Europe from 1906 to 1909 for further studies, and returned to Tokyo Imperial University in 1910 as a full professor. In 1919, Matsumoto accepted a post on the board of directors of the South Manchurian Railway Company, and eventually rose to the position of Vice- President.Ito. Life Along the South Manchurian Railway. Page 39. From 1923, under the second Yamamoto and the Kiyoura administrations, he served as Assistant Director-General of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau. Matsumoto was elected to the Imperial Academy in 1924, and also became the President of Kansai University the same year. In 1934, Prime Minister Saito Makoto asked that Matsumoto replace Kumakichi Nakajima as Minister of Commerce and Industry. In 1938, he supervised the implementation of a new commercial law. Matsumoto returned to the government after World War II under the Shidehara administration as a Minister of State, in charge of the “Committee to Study Constitutional Problems” established by order of General Douglas MacArthur to study constitutional amendment, informally known as the “Matsumoto Committee”. However, the Committee soon decided that only minor changes were needed. Their proposals (i.e. the “Matsumoto Proposal”) were immediately rejected as being too conservative, and a draft of what later became the post-war Constitution of Japan prepared by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers was issued instead.Thiel.

After his schooling, he started with the merchants Calder, Blacklock and Co. When that company was sold, Hawke went to the stock and station agents Martin and Maitland. After a year, that business sold out to the National Mortgage and Agency Company of New Zealand (NMA) in May 1878. He stayed with that company for 40 years and after having worked in Invercargill, Christchurch (as accountant), and Dunedin (as sales agent), he returned to Invercargill in 1890 as the branch manager.

In 1916 the parish was getting large and it was divided so that there would be a church for the outer islands and a church for the inner areas of the municipality. Since the church on Herøya was in the middle, it was decided to tear that one down and build two new churches elsewhere. The same year, a new main church for Herøy was built in Fosnavåg on the island of Bergsøya and Indre Herøy Church was built on the east coast of the island of Gurskøy. Herøy Church burned down the night of Boxing Day in 1998. Many works of art from the Middle Ages were lost in the fire. The new (present) church was completed in 2003.

The album was released in 1985. It was recorded concurrently with its follow-up Optimizm. Even though the copyright date on the album states 1985, the album was recorded in 1988. There is a long and involved history as to why. The original versions of Poganaya molodezh and Optimizm were recorded in 1984 with Egor Letov and Konstantin Ryabinov (Kuzya UO, Кузя УО) and intended to be a Posev album. In late 1984, when the KGB found out about Poganaya molodezh, the band was forcibly broken up; Kuzya UO was conscripted into the army and Letov was sent to a mental asylum. Three months later, on 8 December 1984, Letov was released. The KGB ordered him to destroy the masters, but the albums were already circulating. In 1988, after Letov finished his army service, he decided to reconstruct Poganaya molodezh and Optimizm. On 12 January of that year, Letov started re-recording both albums. He also included recordings from Posev's final album Reggae, Punk and Rock 'n Roll and a few tracks recorded in July 1985 at the House of Culture \\"Zvezdny\\". The project was finished on the 22nd of that month. These re- recordings are now the most common versions. Egor Letov played all instruments on the 1988 album. The 1985 album had Letov on vocals and bass and Kuzya Ryabinov on drums and backing vocals. The album had no cover until the 1999 release on XOP, because it was originally distributed via magnitizdat. On the 2011 vinyl reissue, it was incorrectly released with the wrong track list on the gatefold (left over from the Misteria reissue). The mistake was realised and two stickers were added to the shrinkwrap: one with the correct track list and another with a note from Natalia Chumakova stating the tracks appearing on the album were recorded in 1988.  Track list  For unspecified reasons, \\"Nenavizhu zhenshchin\\" was left off the vinyl and replaced with \\"Blues (nikak ne nazyvaetsya)\\", which had previously appeared on \\"Khorosho!!\\" and the 1999 XOP/Moroz reissue of Poganaya molodezh. \\"V sadike\\" later appeared on the 2007 CD reissue of Istoriya: Posev 1982-1985 on Misteria Zvuka.

He built a two- story frame house for himself and added a dance hall and saloon, both of which became very well known to the locals. In 1880, a post office was established, and a school soon followed. However, the anticipated railroad bypassed the town, and in 1887, the store and saloon closed their doors. Today, the town is completely abandoned, and little remains. Geography Big Bottom is located on the Great Plains in western Meade County, South Dakota.

It is governed by a panchayat, which also governs several nearby villages, and is famous for the large number of turtles in Nelia Pond beside the temple of Shiva. Golia is away from the city of Brahampur and away from the state capital, Bhubaneswar.  Climate  Golia has a tropical wet and dry climate. The summer seasons (March–July) are often close to , and maximum temperatures often exceed between April and June. However, winter lows are around .  Demographics  According to the 2001 Census of India, the population of Golia was 4688, consisting of 2312 males and 2376 females. The literacy rate of Golia is 74.45%, which is slightly higher than the National average of 74.04%. As of 2011, the total number of voters in the village was 3121. Golia is away from the Brahampur, and away from the town of Asika, which is famous for its sugar factory. It is surrounded by Polasara Tehsil to the south, Jagantha Prasad Tehsil to the north, Bellaguntha Tehsil to the west, and Bhanjanager Tehsil to the east. Its neighboring villages are Chirikipada, Kusapali, DahaniPali, Saturusola, Mareyapali, Mala, Lembhu Bagicha, and Badua. The village is very dependent on towns such as Buguda, Polasara, Aska, Chatrapura, Berhampur, Purusotampur, and Jaganath Prasad. = Education = Golia is an education hub for nearby villages, which stretch from Mareyepoli and Kusapali to Kuanala. Multiple students from neighboring villages attend schools in the village to learn and improve their future prospects. Several educational organizations are present in the village: * Golia Primary School * Nua Sahi Sarkari Prathamika Vidayalya * Upendra Bhanja ME School * Sri Kanta Swamy Tapobana High School. Golia SKST High School Golia's Anganwadi Kendra childcare center plays a major role in raising awareness of the value of children's education in the village. Parents are encouraged to allow their children to participate in extra-curricular activities. Thus, some children move to nearby towns like Buguda, Polasara, and Asika for a better education and to study English. = Sources of income = There are no industries currently in this area, and most families are farmers. Golia is known for its fertile soil and agricultural productivity. Most people in the village depend greatly on their land and gardens. Farmers are dependent on rain-fed agriculture and climate sensitive variables. Varieties of crops such as rice, dal, sugar cane, oil seed, mung, and biri are cultivated by farmers. People who want to make more money often leave the village for better opportunities. Industrial cities like Surat (known as \\"The Diamond City\\"), which is known for implementing child labour to process rough Conflict Diamonds from Africa, and Mumbai (known as \\"The Dream City\\") are two common destinations for the people of Golia. Local and state government workers are also present in the village, including teachers, civil servants (such as police officers and people employed in the army, air force, or navy), doctors, nurses, and pharmacists.

Exposition in commemoration of 100th anniversary of the publication of Du \\"Cubisme\\"] (Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris), is a reference to the principle accessory of Metzinger's seminal 1911 Le goûter (Tea Time); dubbed by André Salmon \\"La Joconde du Cubisme\\" (The Mona Lisa of Cubism).André Salmon, L'Art Vivant, Paris, 1920André Salmon, Artistes d'hier et d'aujourd'hui, L'Art Vivant, 6th edition, Paris, 1920Guillaume Apollinaire, Dorothéa Eimert, Anatoli Podoksik, Le Cubisme, 2010 Philadelphia Museum of Art, Tea Time (Woman with a Teaspoon), Provenance Gleizes utilizes a multitude of colors—unlike the limited palette often associated with early Cubism—ranging from large areas of ochre, red, white and blue, surrounding the grisaille figure.Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Karen Lee Spaulding, Masterworks at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Hudson Hills Press, 1999 The man represented in the painting is very likely a portrait of Jean Metzinger. The book entitled Paroles devant la vie,Alexandre Mercereau, Paroles devant la vie, Published 1913 by E. Figuière in Paris held prominently by the model was written by Alexandre Mercereau in 1913. Gleizes had collaborated in founding the Abbaye de Créteil, and was very familiar with Mercereau's writings. Metzinger wrote an important text about Mercereau in 1911.Alexandre Mercereau, Vers et prose 27, October–November 1911: 122-129 It was Mercereau who introduced Gleizes to Metzinger in 1910. Mercereau's publisher, Eugène Figuière, a year earlier had published Du \\"Cubisme\\", the Cubist manifesto written by Gleizes and Metzinger. Gustave Courbet, 1844, Le Rêve (The Hammock), oil on canvas, 70.5 × 97 cm, Museum Oskar Reinhart, Switzerland In Gleizes' painting, one does not merely see a figure swinging in a hammock; one sees multiple aspects of the same figure simultaneously refracted into new pictorial language. Mercereau attempted to represent facets of time in his writings, much as Gleizes and Metzinger attempted to represent facets of space, time and form in their paintings.Bernard Augustine De Voto, Saturday Review, Volume 48, Saturday Review Company, 1965 Man in a Hammock integrates the man into the landscape, forming a single image by virtue of a non-linear grid. This device is used by Gleizes very skillfully to accommodate all aspects of the scene. Mercereau's book, the still-life next to the sitter, the man, and the environment are all symbols of fundamental importance to Gleizes, an artist who rarely, if ever, contented himself with mundane subjects (a guitar, violin, or a bowl of fruit).Painters of the Section d'Or: The Alternatives to Cubism. Exhibition, September 27-October 22, 1967, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York Man in a Hammock is testament to the close association of two artists, Metzinger and Gleizes, and to their shared social, cultural and philosophical conviction that painting represented more than a fleeting glimpse of the world in which they lived, that indeed by showing multiple facets of a subject captured at successive intervals in time simultaneously, a truer more complete image would emerge. > 'We feared the dogmas and hermetic ideas, destructive acts disguised as new > constructions, before they appeared as we knew they would. Rejecting > nothing, we sketched out a traditional curve in French painting from Courbet > to ourselves as the latest arrivals, persuaded that the new order cannot be > created independently of the permanent order'.

Schippers. After he left the television and film industry he started a career as a business man; throughout his career he had a great interest in nature, expressed in narrative, meditative reflections in television and radio series which were later bundled as a single collection. Biography =Television= Jaspars was born in Gronsveld, and studied at the Filmacademie in Amsterdam. In 1964 he was the founder, with Nicolai van der Heyde and Pim de la Parra, of the movie magazine Skoop. His career as a television producer took off in 1967 when he was part of the team (with Wim T. Schippers) that made the groundbreaking show Hoepla for the VPRO, possibly the most controversial TV program of the 1960s and the first program to have a completely naked woman (Phil Bloom) on television, even leading to questions being asked in parliament. Jaspars went on to collaborate with Schippers (who referred to Jaspars as his \\"soundboard\\"), Wim van der Linden, and Ruud van Hemert on other shows, including De Fred Hachéshow (1972), Barend is weer bezig (1972-1973), and Het is weer zo laat! (1978), and he produced the Schippers play Going to the Dogs (1986). He also produced popular programs such as the BB-kwis (with Berend Boudewijn), Sonja's goed nieuwsshow (with Sonja Barend), and Waar gebeurd (in which people were allowed to tell the craziest stores, made with Paul Haenen). For VPRO radio he directed, in 1981, a show dedicated to a \\"shameful night of love\\", in which radio hosts talked to listeners about their love lives; in between, Jaspars read passages from Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther. In 1981-1982 he produced and narrated a series of segments that closed the day's shows, in collaboration with the nature preservation society Natuurmonumenten. In 1984 he produced Een dagje naar het strand, directed by Theo van Gogh. =Inventions= After his television career he was active as a business man selling inventions, developing a storage system (with Samuel Meyering), the Rolykit, which made him almost a millionaire. Working with a collective of inventors they had made a revolutionary caster, but he was unable to bring it to market since he didn't succeed in getting it patented. =Nature and radio= As he got older, he became more and more interested in making nature his profession. A lifelong lover of nature and an avid walker, at age 50 he turned himself into a storyteller, making radio shows for the VPRO about his fascination with nature and his youth in Limburg; he is praised for his narrative talent and poetic style, displayed also in the 1992-1993 eight-part series Ontmoetingen in de natuur in which Jaspars recounted episodes from his childhood, followed by an eight-part series in 1994, Gied Jaspars vertelt. At around the same time Frans Bromet (a friend with whom he had studied at the Filmacademie) worked on a television series on Jaspars, Het leven van Gied Jaspars, as an homage; Jaspars, diagnosed with bowel cancer, and spent two years undergoing surgery and chemotherapy (which he discussed in Vinger aan de pols, a medical television show), but had learned recently that the end was near. He spoke at length on his passion for the outdoors and his love of Dutch landscape in an interview with Frank Flippo in the walkers magazine Te Voet six months before he died. The collection Mijmeringen anthologizes some of his best radio narrations done for the VPRO and the VARA. Jaspars died of bowel cancer, at age 56.

Schippers. It consists of a floor covered with peanut butter and nothing else. That means the art is literally just a floor partially covered with peanut butter. Background The idea for Peanut-Butter Platform evolved from some of Schippers' earlier work. He installed two floor sculptures in a 1962 exhibit at Museum Fodor; he covered the entire floor of one gallery with salt, and another with shards of broken sheet glass. The concept for Peanut-Butter Platform dates from 1962, a time when he began his association with the Fluxus movement; during the 1960s he gained a reputation for absurdist and controversial works of art. He worked on short films as well, with Wim van der Linden and others, but his relations with the established art world were troubled and by the early 1970s he was working almost exclusively on writing and making television shows for the VPRO. Schippers referred to television as \\"the greatest gallery in the world\\". Execution Peanut-Butter Platform was first executed in 1969 in the Mickery gallery in Loenersloot. The work was redone in 1997 in conjunction with a Schippers retrospective at the Centraal Museum in Utrecht, and again in a gallery in 2010. Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam bought the concept in 2010 and installed it in 2011. Museum director Sjarel Ex stated that it was \\"one of the most important acquisitions made in 2010\\". The purchase price was not officially disclosed, but it was reportedly over . The artwork has flexible specifications, and may be installed in various ways. While previous installations were square, the piece constructed in the Rotterdam museum had dimensions of , and consisted of of peanut butter. According to a museum newsletter, \\"Schippers' works are known for their beauty and their senselessness.\\" At least three visitors accidentally walked onto the floor, and were held responsible for the 'damage'. Schippers fielded more than 500 questions asked via video on the blog Pindakaaspost.

Background Since returning to boxing in January 1999, former Undisputed Heavyweight Champion Mike Tyson was undefeated in the five fights he had fought between 1999 and 2000, notching three knockout wins over Francois Botha, Julius Francis and Lou Savarese, and fighting two no-contests with Orlin Norris and Andrew Golota. Tyson's previous fight had come against Golota almost a year earlier on October 20, 2000. Tyson dominated Golota for two rounds before Golota decided to quit between the second and third rounds. Originally, Tyson was rewarded with a technical knockout victory, but it was later changed to a no-contest in January 2001 after a post-fight drug test revealed that Tyson had tested positive for marijuana.Tyson Tests Positive For Marijuana, NY Times article, 2001-01-19, Retrieved on 2013-08-20 Just days before Tyson's positive test became known to the public, he was also issued a three-month suspension by the State of Michigan, which the Nevada Athletic Commission agreed to uphold, though the suspension had little effect on Tyson's boxing schedule as he had already announced his intentions to take those three months off.Michigan Suspends Tyson for 3 Months, NY Times article, 2001-01-17, Retrieved on 2013-08-20 After serving the suspension, Tyson's next fight was initially going to be against David Izon in June 2001,Tyson-Izon Fight Could Be in Australia, Sports Illustrated article, 2001-03-24, Retrieved on 2013-08-20 but the fight was postponed as Showtime attempted to work out a mega-deal that would see Tyson face WBC and IBF Heavyweight champion Hasim Rahman in what would have been Tyson's first title shot since his controversial 1997 fight with Evander Holyfield, but Rahman would go on to have a rematch with Lennox Lewis instead.Lots of Ifs, So Tyson Postpones June Bout, NY Times article, 2001-05-09, Retrieved on 2013-08-20 As such, Tyson moved on from his planned match with Izon and instead agree to meet Danish fighter Brian Nielsen,Tyson to face Brian Nielsen, A.P. article, 2001-08-22, Retrieved on 2013-08-20 whose 62–1 record was one of the most impressive in boxing history, but a large majority of his fights had come against either little-known journeymen or former contenders who were past their prime (including former Tyson adversaries Tony Tubbs, Larry Holmes and Orlin Norris). At a press conference to promote the fight, controversy arose when Nielsen called Tyson a \\"abekat\\", a Danish word meaning \\"monkey cat\\" that was slang for someone who acts foolish, but the word was erroneously translated as \\"monkey man\\". Tyson, thinking it was a racial slur, took offense and proclaimed that the remark would \\"make me punish him even more than I had planned.\\"Tyson angered by alleged remark by Nielsen, ESPN article, 2001-10-13, Retrieved on 2013-08-20 The fight Tyson would have little trouble with Nielsen, constantly landing punch after punch to the defensively challenged Nielsen who offered little movement and largely stood right in front of Tyson. With around 35 seconds left in the third round, Tyson was able to land a six- punch combination to the head of Nielsen that sent Nielsen into the ropes and down onto the canvas in what was only the second knockdown of his career. Nielsen was able to get back up and the fight resumed with 16 seconds, Tyson attempted to land more power punches in hopes of gaining another knockdown, but Nielsen clinched Tyson to ensure that he would make it to the next round. Just before the round ended, Tyson landed an accidental low blow on Nielsen. Though Nielsen was clearly in pain and could now take up to five minutes to recover, he chose to only take a minute and a half before proceeding to the fourth round. Tyson would continue to dominate the remainder of the fight and by the end of sixth round, Nielsen's left eye, which had been cut in the second, was completely shut. As the bell rang to start the seventh round, Nielsen remained seated in his corner and informed referee Steve Smoger that he could not continue. After Smoger confirmed Nielsen's decision, he awarded the victory to Tyson by way of technical knockout. For Tyson it was his longest fight since his 11th round loss to Evander Holyfield in 1996. In between his first fight with Holyfield and his sixth round win over Nielsen, Tyson had six fights, none of which made it past the fifth round.Tyson defeats Nielsen by KO in sixth round, SE Missourian article, 2001-10-14, Retrieved on 2013-08-20 Aftermath Tyson's victory kept him the WBC's number one contender and mandatory challenger to the winner of the Hasim Rahman–Lennox Lewis rematch, which Lewis would win by fourth round knockout the following month.

Schippers, located on the campus of the University of Twente in Enschede. Description Schippers made the tower long after he had left a career in visual arts for television. In the 1960s, he was associated with the Fluxus movement and had gained a reputation for absurdist and controversial works of art, including the famous Pindakaasvloer (1962-1967), consisting basically of a floor covered with peanut butter. He worked on short films as well, with Wim van der Linden and others, but his relations with the established art world were troubled and by the early 1970s he was working almost exclusively on writing and making television shows for the VPRO-- Schippers referred to television as \\"the greatest gallery in the world\\". The work of art consists of the spire of a church tower rising up just above the surface of a pond, suggesting that the church itself has sunk deeply. This partly mysterious quality was Schippers' goal, and was supposed to bring life to the college campus. On the occasion of Schippers' seventieth birthday, a replica of the tower was revealed in Kortrickvijver, near the Willy Dobbeplantsoen in Olst. The replica, like the Willy Dobbeplantsoen, was made by the \\"Gentlemen's Society\\" De Nuts Neut. In February 2013 the tower had been moved to an area in between the summer- and winter dikes of the IJssel river, an area that promptly flooded. Campus life The University of Twente is proud of its extensive collection of art objects on campus, and the tower is the best-known of them all. As a landmark on the UT campus it is a center of year-round activity. In the wintertime, the pond is the location for short- track skating events and the end location for the Elfvijvertocht (the UT variation on the Elfstedentocht since 1987, but with skaters skating on eleven ponds instead of by eleven cities). During soccer tournaments Dutch and German students occupy the tower alternately to hang national flags on, and during rush week events students swim to it—in March.

The modern neighborhood Sugar House, Salt Lake City is named for that trial sugar factory.  Early life  DeLaMare was born on the Isle of Jersey in 1823. His parents were Francis DeLaMare and Jane Esther Hier.  Role in founding the Sugarhouse area  DeLaMare converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in 1849. In 1851, while on a mission to France, DeLaMare accompanied apostle John Taylor to Arras. Arras was home to extensive beet sugar plants and DeLaMare was able to carefully study the industry and evaluate whether or not this business would work well in Utah. Taylor and DeLaMare, along with others, purchased beet sugar manufacturing supplies and imported it to America.  The Philip DeLaMare Company  The sugar factory machinery was first shipped from Liverpool to St. Louis then the equipment had to be taken to Utah by wagon.Richard Jensen, \\"A New Home, A New Life: Contributions of the European Saints in Building the Kingdom\\", Ensign, August 1973. This was the first beet sugar machinery ever brought to America. The company, known as the Philip De La Mare Company, left for Utah Territory on July 4, 1852 with over 80 people. They would arrive on November 10, 1852.\\"Philip De La Mare\\", Pioneer Database 1847–1868, 2020. Retrieved on 24 March 2020. DeLaMare led 52 teams of oxen that hauled the equipment to Salt Lake City. Some of these wagons would break down during the journey due to the heavy weight of equipment. The company also had trouble with their cattle dying and more cattle had to be brought in along the way. It is believed that parts of the intricate machinery were lost during this journey, which would later lead to problems in the factory’s attempts to produce sugar.  The Sugar House Sugar Factory  On March 5, 1853, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, John Taylor, Mr. Mollenhauer, Daniel H. Wells, and Amasa M. Lyman selected the southeast corner of 21st South and Highland Drive as the location for the sugar factory. This is in the part of Salt Lake City now known as \\"Sugar House\\". Seeds were sent ahead and about 300 acres of land were planted with sugar beets. The factory began operating in February 1855. The finished factory used a water wheel in Parley’s Creek to power the factory. By the end of the summer in 1855, Brigham Young concluded the factory to be a failure and ordered it to be shut down. The factory could not produce sugar, and would only ever create molasses. There are several theories as to why the factory could not produce sugar. It appears some parts of the factory machinery may have been lost on the journey to Utah. In the Agricultural History journal, historian Leonard Arrington theorized that the problems was with the chemical nature of the beets made them difficult to convert since they were grown in alkali soil. Another historian believed the salt content of the beets was much higher than the content of those grown in France and that this imbalance caused the problem. Others have speculated that the Sugar House factory was never able to master the crystallization method necessary for the process. It is believed that approximately $100,000 was spent in the attempt to make sugar production successful at the factory. The factory was later used as a paper mill (which processed sunflower seeds, weeds, straw, and old rags), roundhouse, bucket and tub works, woolen factory, a machine shop for the Utah Central Railroad, coal yard office, and weighing station. The factory was completely torn down in 1928.

He moved to Liverpool in November 1837 to join a firm of merchants. After a year, he was promoted to the firm's head office in London. After his health deteriorated through lung disease, he moved back to Scotland in 1845.

On 3 June 1852 at St Paul's Church, Gilfillan married Gertrude Anne Eliza Davies, the eldest daughter of colonial surgeon William Davies. They were to have five sons and three daughters. Gilfillan was one of the original six appointees from Auckland to the Legislative Council. He was appointed on 6 May 1854 and served until 2 August 1861 when he resigned; then 12 July 1862 to 23 April 1866 when he again resigned. He was elected to the Auckland Provincial Council at the 1853 New Zealand provincial elections. He represented the Suburbs of Auckland electorate in the first council, from 20 July 1853 until 25 September 1855. He then represented the Auckland West electorate in the fifth council from 2 May 1867 until 27 May 1868. He was a member of the executive council for three periods (14 March 1854 – 21 January 1855; 8 April 1864 – 4 November 1864; 6 May 1867 – 6 February 1868) and during some of that time, he was Provincial Secretary. Gilfillan died on 1 February 1875 from chronic bronchitis, aged 53 years.

Accounts of Chemical Research As brilacidin is modeled after a defensin, it is also called a defensin mimetic. Brilacidin is an antibiotic that works by disrupting bacterial cell membranes, mimicking defensins that play a role in innate immunity. Several mimics of antimicrobial peptides, both peptides and non-peptides, have been studied, but none have overcome difficulties to reach the market. Structure and action Brilacidin, a non-peptide chemical mimic, is an arylamide foldamer designed to replicate the amphiphilic properties of antimicrobial peptides while solving the problems encountered by peptide-based antimicrobials. Brilacidin, a broad- spectrum antibiotic, has potent Gram positive activity and Gram negative coverage, and is highly effective in treating the 'superbug' methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Brilacidin has low cytotoxicity against mammalian cells while selectively targeting bacteria, directly and rapidly disrupting their membranes, resulting in the bacteria's death. Due to this unique mechanism of action (mimicking the host's natural immune response, proven to be successful in fighting off infections over millions of years of evolution), bacterial antibiotic resistance is less likely to develop. Potential significance There has not been a new drug approval from a new class of antibiotics since 1987. While six antibiotics have been approved over the last year, they are all adaptations of existing antibiotic classes. None of the recently approved novel antibiotics represent entirely new classes. Novel antibiotics are crucial as antibiotic resistance poses a global health risk. The World Health Organization, warning of a \\"post-antibiotic era\\" has stated that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a \\"problem so serious that it threatens the achievements of modern medicine\\".  History  Leveraging advanced computational bioinformatics,twst.com brilacidin and other defensin mimetics were first developed by University of Pennsylvania-based researchers. Their efforts were consolidated, and officially incorporated, in 2002, under the company name PolyMedix. PolyMedix conducted pre-clinical and clinical research with brilacidin through a completed Phase 2a human clinical trial with positive results. After discontinuing a clinical trial for an unrelated compound PolyMedix filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection on April 1, 2013. Cellceutix acquired the PolyMedix assets and intellectual property, including the licenses and patents for brilacidin and the rest of the HDP-mimetic pipeline, from bankruptcy court which on September 4, 2013 approved Cellceutix's stalking horse bid.  Other uses  Cellceutix is pursuing other clinical applications of brilacidin and related anti-infective HDP-mimetic compounds, including their prophylactic use on implanted medical devices, having already entered into a material transfer agreement with a division of a large U.S. pharmaceutical company. An active clinical trial, brilacidin for oral mucositis is detailed below. In pre-clinical research, a mouthwash formulation of brilacidin was well tolerated and efficacious for oral mucositis, significantly reducing the number of days with ulcerations and significantly reducing the mucositis scores in a dose dependent manner. Pre- clinical research has shown potential for brilacidin for ocular, Otic, and diabetic foot ulcers.  Clinical trials  PolyMedix advanced brilacidin through early stage human clinical trials to a completed Phase 2a proof-of- concept clinical trial. Since acquisition, brilacidin has to date completed a Phase 2b clinical trial with positive results. Results, as detailed below, showed brilacidin compared favorably with Daptomycin, though administered in a single-dose as compared to Daptomycin's 7-day dosing regimen. Discussions presently are underway between Cellceutix and the FDA to begin a pivotal Phase 3 trial for ABSSSI. Plans and trial design for the Phase 3 clinical trail(s) are expected be made public after the post-P2b clinical trial with the FDA expected in June 2015 Brilacidin was granted the Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation by the FDA under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act of 2011 (GAIN Act). Receiving QIDP designation means that brilacidin is now eligible for additional FDA incentives in the approval and marketing pathway, including fast track designation and priority review for development and a five-year extension of market exclusivity. = Phase 2a clinical trial – ABSSSI = Initial Treatment for Acute Bacterial Skin Infections (ABSSSI) Caused by Staphylococcus aureus Randomized, Dose Ranging, Active Controlled Efficacy and Safety Evaluation of PMX-30063 As Initial Treatment for Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI) Caused by Staphylococcus aureus The study started in October 2010 and had a primary completion date of December 2011 for final data collection for the primary outcome measure. Overall, 215 patients were randomized into either one of the three brilacidin arms or the active comparator Daptomycin arm. There were three dosing regimens for brilacidin, a low, medium and high dose administered for three days, and one dosing regimen for Daptomycin administered for seven days. The clinical trial was successful, demonstrating safety and clinical efficacy for all evaluated doses of brilacidin, with three-day brilacidin cure rates of all dosing regimens comparable with seven days of Daptomycin. The results indicated the potential for a shorter brilacidin dosing regimen. Shorter dosing regimens are important as they reduce the risks from Intravenous therapy complications, reduce costs such as reduced hospital stays and clinic visits, and can help reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance through a combination of a quick bacterial kill, shorter duration of treatment,Marc Bonten, MD; Eijkman-Winkler Institute for Medical Microbiology, Utrecht, the Netherland  Infectious Diseases, and Inflammation and increased patient compliance. As patients may feel better before treatment is complete and discontinue treatment too early, this is a risk for their health and also the development of antibiotic resistance. A single one day dosage eliminates the risk of patient non-compliance. = Phase 2b clinical trial – ABSSSI = Efficacy and Safety Study of Brilacidin to Treat Serious Skin Infections A Randomized, Double-Blind Study Comparing Three Dosing Regimens of Brilacidin to daptomycin in the Treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI) The study started February 2014 and announced completed enrollment August 19, 2014. Overall, 215 patients were randomized to one of three dosing regimens of brilacidin (single dose 0.6 mg/kg; single-dose 0.8 mg/kg; 1.2 mg/kg over 3 days) or 7 days of once daily daptomycin. The Clinical Trial had positive results, indicating that single dose brilacidin was comparable to 7 days of daptomycin. The primary endpoint was clinical success in the intent-to-treat population, defined as reduction of at least 20% in area of the ABSSSI lesion, relative to baseline, when observed 48–72 hours after the first dose of study drug, and no rescue antibiotics administered. All three brilacidin treatment arms (two single-dose regimens and one three-day dose regimen) had clinical success rates comparable to the clinical success rate of the FDA-approved seven-day dosing regimen of daptomycin. All brilacidin treatment regimens were generally well tolerated. There were six serious adverse events (SAEs) reported in the study, none of which were considered related to brilacidin by the principal investigator. The results were also positive in the microbiological intent-to-treat population (MITT). This is an important population, as it consists of patients enrolled in the trial who had cultures obtained at the baseline visit that were positive for common ABSSSI pathogens. Most of these cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, and approximately 40% of these were (MRSA). This is currently the most important bacterial pathogen in patients with ABSSSI. The P2b clinical trial results were reported for peer review by abstract and oral presentation at the 2015 European Congress of Clinical microbiology and Infectious Diseases = Phase 2 clinical trial – oral mucositis = Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety & Efficacy of Brilacidin Oral Rinse in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer The brilacidin trial for oral mucositis (Briladidin- OM) has started in May 2015 and is expected to be completed in December 2017. Brilacidin-OM is an oral rinse of brilacidin in water. Approximately 60 patients who are receiving chemoradiation for head and neck cancer are randomized to receive either brilacidin-OM or the placebo three times daily for seven weeks. The study design is double blind. Various primary and secondary outcome measures will be recorded to assess efficacy of brilacidin- OM to prevent or reduce the severity of oral mucositis in patients receiving chemo-radiation.  The HDP-mimetic pipeline  Development is ongoing for numerous brilacidin analogs, selected by laboratory testing of the various HDP mimetics and defensin-mimetic compounds in the antibiotic pipeline. Pre- clinical research has been shown select brilacidin analogs effective in killing a variety of important Gram-negative pathogens (the so-called superbugs), such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii as well as highly multi-drug resistant ndm-1-producing K. pneumoniae. An abstract update on these efforts was presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease (ECCMID) 2015 annual conference. The footnote links to the full presentation. Other HDP-Mimetic analogs have proven effective in vitro against C. albicans and other Candida species. Also acquired with brilacidin and the HDP-mimetic pipeline were the rights to the related PolyCide family of compounds, polymeric formulations that function as antimicrobial agents. These compounds are similar to brilacidin in that they are also synthetic mimics of HDPs. These compounds have superior bacterial killing activity over triclosan and silver nitrate, common biocidal agents. PolyCide compounds could be used as additives to paints, plastics, textiles and other materials to create self- sterilizing products and surfaces.

Phase III studies in complicated intra- abdominal infections (cIAI) and complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) were recently completed with mixed results. Eravacycline has been granted fast track designation by the FDA.  Medical uses  Eravacycline has shown broad spectrum of activity against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including multi-drug resistant strains, such as methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.

Clinical trials  Current and past clinical trial information: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=&term;=eravacycline&cntry1;=&state1;=&recrs;= = Phase 3 trials =  Complicated Intra-abdominal infections (IGNITE 1)  The IGNITE 1 trial compared twice-daily IV eravacycline to once-daily ertapenem for the treatment of cIAI. A total of 541 patients were included and eravacycline demonstrated noninferiority to ertapenem. An additional pivotal phase 3 study (IGNITE 4) is planned for late 2016 with initial results likely available in the fourth quarter of 2017.  Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (IGNITE 4)  IGNITE 4 assessed twice-daily intravenous eravacycline(1.0 mg/kg every 12 hours) compared to those receiving meropenem (1g every 8 hours). The study enrolled 500 adult patients with the primary endpoint being clinical response at the test-of-cure visit which is 25–31 days after initial dosing. Primary efficiency analysis was conducted using a 12.5% non-inferiority margin in the microbiological intent-to-treat (micro-ITT) population. On July 25, 2017 Tetraphase pharmaceuticals released top line data via press showing clinical cure rates in the micro-ITT population to be 90.8% and 91.2% for eravacycline (n=195) and meropenem (n=205), respectively (95% CI: -6.3%,5.3%). Primary analysis was conducted using a 12.5% non-inferiority margin of the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) and clinically evaluable (CE) patient populations. Clinical cure rates in the MITT population were 92.4% and 91.6% for eravacycline (n=250) and meropenem (n=249), respectively (95% CI: -4.1%,5.8%). Clinical cure rates in the CE population were 96.9% and 96.1% for eravacycline (n=225) and meropenem (n=231), respectively (95% CI: -2.9%,4.5%). Eravacycline met the primary efficacy endpoints according to the FDA and EMA guidelines. The secondary analyses were consistent with, and supportive of, the primary outcome according to Tetraphase. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) in the trial. Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAEs) rates were similar in both treatment groups with the most commonly reported drug-related adverse events (AEs) for eravacycline were infusion site reactions, nausea and vomiting, each occurring at a rate of less than 5%. The most common Gram-negative pathogens in the study included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas and Bacteroides. Full data from IGNITE4 will become available as the company prepares to submit its New Drug Application (NDA) in the first quarter of 2018 for Eravacycline treatment of Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections.  Complicated Urinary Tract infections (IGNITE 2)  The IGNITE 2 trial compared 7 days of IV eravacycline to IV levofloxacin with the option to convert patients in either group to oral therapy after 3 days for cUTI. Overall, eravacyline was inferior to levofloxacin in response rate (60.4 vs 66.9%); however it was noted that patients who completed therapy with the IV formulation had higher response rates, suggesting formulation issues with the oral option. Due to the performance of the IV formulation, an additional phase 3 trial is planned to support a supplemental NDA for the cUTI indication. = Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (IGNITE 3) = IGNITE3 is currently ongoing starting January 2017 with expected completion December 2018. This study is evaluating IV eravacycline (1.5 mg/kg every 24 hours) compared to ertapenem (1g every 24 hours) for the treatment of cUTI. IGNITE3 is currently enrolling approximately 1,000 patients who will be randomized 1:1 to receive intravenous eravacycline or ertapenem for a minimum of 5 days, and will then be eligible for transition to oral levofloxacin. The primary endpoints are Proportion of Participants in the microbiological Intent-to-treat (micro-ITT) Population demonstrating Clinical Cure and Microbiologic Success at the End of Intravenous (EOI) Visit [Time Frame: EOI visit (within 1 day of the completion of intravenous study drug treatment) ] & Proportion of Participants in the micro-ITT Population Demonstrating Clinical Cure and Microbiologic Success at the Test-Of-Cure (TOC) Visit [ Time Frame: TOC visit (14–17 days after randomization) ].

Schippers with Wim van der Linden, Gied Jaspars, and Ruud van Hemert and broadcast by the VPRO in 1972-1973. The show was produced by Ellen Jens. Four regular episodes and a Christmas special were made. The series caused considerable controversy, particularly because of a scene in which Queen Juliana of the Netherlands was mocked. Genesis and content The show was built around the character of Barend Servet, a clumsy journalist played by IJf Blokker, who had first appeared in the 1971 TV show De Fred Haché Show. Other characters who returned from the Hachéshow were Sjef van Oekel (played by Dolf Brouwers) and Fred Haché (played by Harry Touw). In typical Wim T. Schippers fashion the show, like its predecessor, derived its comedy from low-brow humor involving silly costumes, dog turds, nudity, and chaos; it combined the trivial and banal with controversial content. To some the show appeared to be 'anti-television' (a hidden protest against tv productions being too polished and error free.)Schumacher 247. There were four episodes plus a Christmas special, Waar heb dat nou voor nodig. (\\"What Does It Need to be Like That Anyway?\\") Schippers et al. Het Barend Servet effect, 6. The Christmas special was notable, especially for two songs written by Schippers and Van Mechelen for Dolf Brouwers, \\"Vette jus\\" (\\"Fat Gravy\\") and \\"Juliana onze vorstin\\" (\\"Juliana Our Monarch\\").Schippers et al. Het Barend Servet effect, 203. Controversy and praise The show provoked national controversy with a skit in which Barend Servet interviewed Juliana of the Netherlands (played by \\"Ria\\", one \\"RiMiCo ladies\\"); the queen drank sherry, and cleaned Brussels sprouts in order to pretend to feel close to the Dutch people, before throwing them in the trash or donating them to a children's home. The show rose quite a few questions in Dutch parliament about the depiction of Her Majesty the Queen. VPRO was reprimanded by the minister of culture, narrowly escaping having its broadcasting hours cut. While there were plenty of negative reviews, one notable supporter of De Fred Haché Show and Barend is weer bezig was Frans Haks, an art historian and critic who in 1978 became the director of the Groninger Museum (where he became known and controversial for his appreciation of avant-garde art). In the Museumjournaal, a well-established magazine for art and art history, he praised the show and said that its apparent clumsiness and triviality in \\"een geprofileerd and consistent kunstbegrip\\", \\"a well-shaped and consistent conception of art\\". His article also provoked strong reactions: the issue sold out quickly, at the same time that some readers canceled their subscriptions.

It was released on September 13, 2013 through Relapse Records to positive reviews. It is the first album by Ulcerate to be released through Relapse. Musical style and writing While the band has been noted for its use of dissonance, drummer Jamie Saint Merat countered that \\"dissonance for dissonance’s sake is extremely fatiguing\\". Given this, Merat said that Vermis uses melody in a \\"weird and unsettling\\" way to create \\"a tangible amount of tension and release\\". Merat further noted that the band made a conscious decision with Vermis to bring back \\"a level of unpredictability we've always had in the past\\" due to the feeling that the previous album, The Destroyers of All, \\"came out a little too fluid on the whole\\". According to Merat, Vermis uses the metaphor of invertebrate animal species to explore \\"the over-arching theme of spinelessness [and] oppression\\". Merat explained that different forms of oppression are explored on the album, including: Critical reception Vermis has received positive reviews from critics. Several reviewers noted that Ulcerate's approach posed a challenge for casual listeners, with Greg Pratt, Dave Schalek, and Brandon Ringo cautioning that Vermis placed exceptional demands upon its audience prior to disclosing its positive features. Pitchfork's Andy O'Connor cited the album's use of technicality favourably, remarking that \\"as complicated as the music may be, Vermis is an album of songs, not exercises. Technicality is used to convey madness; it's not the ultimate goal in and of itself\\". Praising the band's \\"distinctive voice\\", Popmatters' Craig Hayes observed that Vermis extended the band's \\"continually refined\\" creative trajectory by \\"bringing more artful sculpturing to its downtuned dissonance and complex time signatures, and setting that against a backdrop of often droning and industrial textures. The band’s work has evolved to become steadily more nerve-shredding and formidable, with the usual riff-based shreds of death metal mutilated into a seething and polychromatic canvas of avant-garde atmospherics\\".

Biography Morse was born in Exeter, England, in 1822. In New Zealand, he initially lived near Nelson in Waimea West near the Redwood family. Morse was a prominent member of the Nelson Jockey Club and a successful breeder of race horses; his horse Ladybird won the 1863 New Zealand Championship Race in Dunedin. Morse was an early settler, and together with John Cooper, he was the first to bring sheep into the Wairau Valley in November 1846. Morse and Cooper established a homestead above the Wairau River and they called it Top House, as it was at a higher altitude and further inland than any other dwelling in the Wairau Valley. A hotel and then a telegraph station were built, and they all adopted the name Top House. When a post office opened in 1891, the name was standardised as a single word; the Tophouse locality is located near State Highway 63. Since 1861, national shooting competitions were held in New Zealand and Morse was the national champion in 1863. Morse was a member of the Nelson Volunteers and on 1 June 1860, he became the Captain of the 8th Company, Waimea West of the Nelson volunteer force. He succeeded Nathaniel Edwards, who had become too busy with business interests to devote his time to the volunteer forces. In May 1866, Morse was appointed Major in command of the Nelson militia and volunteer forces. Morse was a member of the Legislative Council from 8 May 1866, and he was appointed to that body at the same time as Joseph Hawdon (Christchurch) and Ponsonby Peacocke (Auckland). Morse remained a member until 12 May 1869, when he resigned. In 1869, Morse was made a Justice of the Peace. In 1873, he moved to Wanganui where he lived in a residence called Headlands. He continued with horse breeding and became a prominent member of the local jockey club. He was a member of the Wangaehu Highway Board. He died on 16 November 1882 at his residence, after having been ill for several weeks. He had suffered from dropsy for a long time. He was described as having been good humoured and possessing common sense.

He started his career as an engineer in Lahore, and later turned to art. He shifted to Delhi after partition of India in 1947, and in 1950 studied art education from New York University School of Education. Subsequently, became an art educator, teaching at College of Art, Delhi, and in time a noted modern sculptor to his generation. Though he also ventured into painting, drawings and poetry. In 1979, Amar Nath Sehgal set up his studio in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and lived between Luxembourg and India until his return to New Delhi in 2004. His long romance with Luxembourg goes back to 1966 when he had his first solo exhibition at the Musée National d'Histoire et d'Arts in Luxembourg-City. His iconic bronze bust sculpture of Mahatma Gandhi in the Municipal Park in Luxembourg celebrates the strong connection he had with Luxembourg. The bronze bust, a gift by the philanthropist Henry J. Leir was inaugurated on 21 June 1973 in the presence of the Minister of Foreign Affaires Gaston Thorn and the Ambassador of India to Luxembourg K. B. Lall. In February 1980, the original bust was stolen and in 1982 Amar Nath Sehgal gifted a copy of the original which was inaugurated on 2 October 1982, on the 113th Anniversary of the Birth of Mahatma Gandhi. Later in life, he also became a pioneer of intellectual property rights, especially moral rights in copyright for artists in India, after he fought a 13-year-long legal case with Government of India. A bronze mural which he created for the Vigyan Bhavan, Delhi in the 1960s, was removed without his consent, during renovations in 1979. He filed the case at Delhi High Court in 1992, and the courts finally awarded him damages in 2005. In 1986, he founded \\"The Creative Fund\\" in Luxembourg to help young artists from Luxembourg and India discover and be inspired by the rich history, the culture and the heritage of both countries. 1993, he was awarded the Lalit Kala Akademi Fellowship by the Lalit Kala Akademi, India's National Academy of Art, the highest honour in the fine arts conferred by the Government of India.

Subsequently, he started worked as an engineer in Lahore, while studying arts privately. During the riots that preceded the partition of India in 1947, he left Lahore in May 1947, and travelled to Eastern Punjab and Kangra-Kullu Valley, where he witnessed macabre killings of local Muslim minority. This was to have a lasting impact both of his psyche and his art. Finally he settled in Delhi, where he reestablished himself. He travelled on a freight for 47 days to New York. He later obtained a master's degree in art education from New York University School of Education (now rename Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development) in 1950. During this period he was exposed to world art and inspirations of Henri Matisse. Career His first exhibition was inaugurated in New York in 1951, by India's permanent representative to the United Nations. Upon his return from US, Sehgal taught at the Modern School, New Delhi for a short while, and his wife Sheila Dhawan was also a teacher at its Junior School. Later he remained a faculty at College of Art, Delhi, University of Delhi and established his studio in Delhi. In time, he became a leading exponents of modernism in Indian sculptor. Themes of much of his oeuvre revolved around the importance of individual freedom and human dignity, and his response the horrors of political violence.Bhattacharya, p. 18 His works were exhibited in many places across the world, winning him international acclaim. Many of his sculptures in stone and metal are in the collection of National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi.Bhattacharya, p. 19 In 1957, he was commission to create mural for the Vigyan Bhavan, India's first state convention centre. The bronze mural spanned 140 feet by 40 feet, depicting rural and modern India, and was completed five years later and installed in the foyer of the building in 1962. Subsequently, in 1979, during renovations, the mural was removed without his consent, and shifted to the storehouse. When in the following years despite his request no action was taken, He filed a case at the Delhi High Court seeking damages. Thus Amar Nath Sehgal v. Union of India. After a 13-year-long legal proceeding, the case was finally decided in his favour on 21 February 2005. Thus it became a landmark case in Indian legal history, as for the first time uphold the moral right of an author under the Indian Copyright Act and awarded damages. The government was also asked to return his mural Besides art, Sehgal was also a poet, he published two collection of his poems, Lonesome Journey (1996) and Awaiting a New Dawn (1998).

It is native to parts of Africa and Asia, and it has been introduced to other continents, such as Australia and the Americas. It is cultivated as a fodder for livestock, for erosion control,Cook, B., et al. Alysicarpus vaginalis. Tropical Forages. 2005. and as a green manure.Alysicarpus vaginalis. Flora of China. Common names include alyce clover, buffalo clover, buffalo-bur, one-leaf clover, and white moneywort.Alysicarpus vaginalis. Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk (PIER). USDA Forest Service. Description This species is an annual or perennial herb; different varieties may be either annual or perennial, and some behave as perennials in wet conditions but grow as annuals in dry regions. The stems take an erect form or run along the ground, more often erect when growing in dense stands.Alysicarpus vaginalis (L.) DC. Grassland Species Profiles. Plant Production and Protection Division. FAO. They reach one meter in length and usually have branches. The leaves are not divided into leaflets. The blades are variable in shape and up to about 6.5 centimeters long. Racemes of up to 12 flowers occur at the stem tips and grow from the leaf axils. The flower corolla is half a centimeter long and can be shades of red, purple, blue, or yellow. The fruit is a lightly hairy, cylindrical but compressed legume pod up to 2.5 centimeters long. The dark red seeds are no more than 1.5 millimeters long. Cultivation This plant is grown in pastures as forage for livestock and is sometimes cut for hay. Cattle and horses find it palatable, and sheep found it about as palatable as alfalfa in one trial. It is very tolerant of grazing and mowing. It is most successful in the tropics, but it also grows well in warmer temperate regions. It loses leaves in light frosts and is killed by heavy frosts, but it grows back when winter ends. It tolerates shade and can be grown in the cover of shrubs. It grows in many types of soils, from sands to clays. It does not tolerate high soil salinity. The crop reportedly yields up to six tons of hay per hectare. If allowed to set seed it yields about 300 kilograms of seed per hectare. To improve its nitrogen fixation for soil improvement the seeds can be inoculated with the rhizobia used for cowpeas.Newman, Y. C., et al. Alyceclover - Summer Annual Legume. SS-AGR-47. Florida Cooperative Extension Service. University of Florida IFAS. Original publication 2000, revised 2010. Ecology Good companion plants include grasses such as St. Augustine grass (Stenotaphrum secundatum), hurricane grass (Bothriochloa pertusa), and Nadi blue grass (Dichanthium caricosum). It can be grown with other legumes, such as Spanish clover (Desmodium heterophyllum) and showy pigeon pea (Cajanus scarabaeoides). A main disadvantage of the crop is its susceptibility to root-knot nematodes. Prevention measures include growing the plant on heavier soils, which reduce the severity of infestation, and to use certain cultivars that may be more resistant to nematodes.

On the slide: a photograph of the sculpture Classmates by Paul Tadlock, which is often used to illustrate 'mansplaining'. Mansplaining (a blend word of man and the informal form splaining of the gerund explaining) is a pejorative term meaning \\"(of a man) to comment on or explain something to a woman in a condescending, overconfident, and often inaccurate or oversimplified manner\\".'Definition' Dictionary.comMansplaining, Merriam-Webster.com Author Rebecca Solnit ascribed the phenomenon to a combination of \\"overconfidence and cluelessness\\". Lily Rothman, of The Atlantic, defined it as \\"explaining without regard to the fact that the explainee knows more than the explainer, often done by a man to a woman\\". In its original use, mansplaining differed from other forms of condescension in that it was said to be rooted in the assumption that a man is likely to be more knowledgeable than a woman. However, it has come to be used more broadly, often applied when a man takes a condescending tone in an explanation to anyone, regardless of the age or gender of the intended recipients: a \\"man 'splaining\\" can be delivered to any audience. In 2010, it was named by the New York Times as one of its \\"Words of the Year\\". American Dialect Society nominated Mansplaining as the “most creative” new word in 2012.  Origins  The verb splain has been in use for more than 200 years, originally as a colloquial pronunciation of the Late Middle English word explain. It came increasingly to refer to condescending or verbose explanations. The term mansplaining was inspired by an essay, \\"Men Explain Things to Me: Facts Didn't Get in Their Way\\", written by Rebecca Solnit and published on TomDispatch.com on 13 April 2008. In the essay, Solnit told an anecdote about a man at a party who said he had heard she had written some books. She began to talk about her most recent, on Eadweard Muybridge, whereupon the man cut her off and asked if she had \\"heard about the very important Muybridge book that came out this year\\"—not considering that it might be (as, in fact, it was) Solnit's book. Solnit did not use the word mansplaining in the essay, but she described the phenomenon as \\"something every woman knows\\". A month later the word appeared in a comment on the social network LiveJournal. It became popular among feminist bloggers before entering mainstream commentary. The word was included in 2010 by the New York Times as one of its words of the year, nominated in 2012 for the American Dialect Society's \\"most creative word of the year\\" honor, and added in 2014 to the online Oxford Dictionaries. Solnit later published Men Explain Things to Me (2014), a collection of seven essays on similar themes. Women, including professionals and experts, are routinely seen or treated as less credible than men, she wrote in the title essay, and their insights or even legal testimony are dismissed unless validated by a man. She argued that this was one symptom of a widespread phenomenon that \\"keeps women from speaking up and from being heard when they dare; that crushes young women into silence by indicating, the way harassment on the street does, that this is not their world. It trains us in self-doubt and self-limitation just as it exercises men's unsupported overconfidence.\\" In 2018, during a lecture at Moe's Books in Berkeley, California, Solnit said, “I’m falsely credited with coining the term ‘mansplaining’. It was a 2010 New York Times word of the year. I did not actually coin it. I was a bit ambivalent about the word because it seems a little bit more condemnatory of the male of the species than I ever wanted it to be.”Solnit did not coin the term ‘mansplaining’ Financial Times  Usage  Journalists have used the word to describe the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney; President Donald Trump; Governor of Texas Rick Perry; MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell; various characters on the HBO drama series The Newsroom; music executive Jimmy Iovine; Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull; actor Matt Damon; and consumer rights advocate Ralph Nader. In February 2016 the term sparked an argument between two members of a committee of the Australian Senate, when Labor senator Katy Gallagher told Communications Minister Mitch Fifield: \\"I love the mansplaining. I'm enjoying it.\\" In 2013 Dictionary.com said it was adding both mansplain and the suffix (libfix) -splain to its dictionary. Its announcement read in part: \\"In addition to being creative, this term, particularly the -splaining part, has proven to be incredibly robust and useful as a combining form in 2013.\\" Dictionary.com noted that the meaning of mansplain had changed somewhat since 2009, from \\"intense and serious to casual and jocular\\", while older -splain words still have \\"heavy cultural and political connotations and are often added to the names of politicians\\". Mansplaining has also engendered parallel constructions such as womansplaining, whitesplaining, rightsplaining, and Damonsplaining. In November 2017 Dr. Jennifer Gunter suggested in The New York Times that the collective noun rash be used for mansplainers, as in \\"a rash of mansplainers\\", partly because \\"[i]n medicine a rash can be a mild annoyance that goes away and never returns.\\"  Criticism  MPR News Staff disputed the usefulness of the term. Given its gender-specific nature and negative connotation, Lesley Kinzel described it as inherently biased, essentialist, dismissive, and a double standard. In a 2016 Washington Post article, Cathy Young wrote that it is just one of a number of terms using \\"man\\" as a derogatory prefix, and that this convention is part of a \\"current cycle of misandry\\". Meghan Daum, in a 2015 Los Angeles Times article, wrote that \\"To suggest that men are more qualified for the designation than women is not only sexist but almost as tone deaf as categorizing everything that a man says as mansplaining.\\" In 2014 Solnit herself said she had doubts about it: \\"[I]t seems to me to go a little heavy on the idea that men are inherently flawed this way, rather than that some men explain things they shouldn't and don't hear things they should.\\" As the word became more popular, several commentators complained that misappropriation had diluted its original meaning. Joshua Sealy-Harrington and Tom McLaughlin wrote in newspaper The Globe and Mail that the term has been used as an ad hominem to silence debate.

He is most notable for suppressing a Slavic revolt in the Peloponnese in 921/22. Origin and appointment to the Peloponnese Arotras was a scion of the Krenites family, an aristocratic clan of Armenian origin present in Byzantium since the early 9th century. In early 921 or 922 (earlier scholars dated this event to ), when he held the rank of protospatharios, he was appointed as military governor (strategos) of the theme of the Peloponnese and tasked with suppressing the revolt of the Slavic tribes of the Melingoi and Ezeritai. The two tribes had rebelled in the past, in 840–42, and after their defeat by Theoktistos Bryennios had been obliged to pay an annual tribute of 60 and 300 gold solidi respectively. In , they began to disobey the commands of the strategos John Proteuon, refusing to accept the rulers (\\"archons\\") he chose for them and to be conscripted for overseas service in southern Italy against an ongoing Lombard rebellion. According to the account of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos () in his De administrando imperio, Arotras began his campaign against them in March, burning and plundering their lands around Mount Taygetos until November. The two tribes submitted again, and were condemned to pay an increased tribute of 600 solidi. Arotras was transferred (late 922 or early 923) to the neighbouring theme of Hellas and was replaced by Bardas Platypodes. Under Platypodes, strife in the Peloponnese resumed as he quarrelled with the local nobility, while another revolt by Slavic troops in the Peloponnese followed soon after, which the Melingoi and Ezeritai exploited in getting their tribute reduced to the previous amounts. Possible identifications Two 10th-century seals mentioning the \\"imperial protospatharios and strategos of the Peloponnese Krenites\\" are known and probably belong to him. He has also been identified by some with a person of the same name, mentioned in the hagiography of Saint Luke of Steiris. This Krenites served as strategos of Hellas from until 952/955, before going on to serve as strategos of the Peloponnese. Most scholars, however, believe the two to be separate persons. Some scholars, like Steven Runciman, also equated him with another Krenites, who was used by Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920–944) in diplomatic missions to the Armenian princes.

Her work uses the idioms of mainstream art to express the experience of Aboriginal people in Canada. Life Jane Ash Poitras was born in Fort Chipewyan Alberta in 1951. Her mother died of tuberculosis when Poitras was six and she was adopted by an elderly German woman. She grew up in Edmonton, Alberta in a Catholic household. Before turning to a career in the arts, she obtained a B.Sc. in microbiology at the University of Alberta. She later obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in printmaking from the University of Alberta and a Master's from Columbia University. Work Poitras uses a vocabulary of layered images, readymades and text to explore the historical and personal experience of an aboriginal person in Canadian society. This approach to creating images was developed out of Dada by the American Abstract Expressionists and their associates; Mark Rothko, Kurt Schwitters, Robert Rauschenberg, and Cy Twombly. Poitras was exposed to this work during her studies at Columbia University. Poitras extends the meaning of her paintings by applying objects holding symbolic significance to the surface of the compositions. A Sacred Prayer for a Sacred Island, 1991 includes an eagle feather and a five dollar bill. An eagle feather is considered sacred by North American Aboriginal People; the five-dollar bill represents the treaty annuity paid by the Canadian government to aboriginal individuals. The paintings Poitras creates can be very large. One of the pieces acquired by the Royal Ontario Museum in 2010 is a triptych 25 feet long by 9 feet high. Potato Peeling 101 to Ethnobotany 101 (2004), portrays a narrative of the experience of preserving aboriginal cultural knowledge through the years of forced assimilation. Poitras maintains an active exhibition schedule, having participated in over 30 solo exhibitions and 60 group exhibitions before 2006. She is a long-standing sessional instructor with the University of Alberta and travels as a guest lecturer across North America. =Mentorship= Poitras has mentored young apprentice artists of Aboriginal background, including Linus Woods.

History Nicolas Schöffer's CYSP I (1956) was perhaps the first artwork to explicitly employ cybernetic principles (CYSP is an acronym that joins the first two letters of the words \\"CYbernetic\\" and \\"SPatiodynamic\\"). The artist Roy Ascott elaborated an extensive theory of cybernetic art in \\"Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision\\" (Cybernetica, Journal of the International Association for Cybernetics (Namur), Volume IX, No.4, 1966; Volume X No.1, 1967) and in \\"The Cybernetic Stance: My Process and Purpose\\" (Leonardo Vol 1, No 2, 1968). Art historian Edward A. Shanken has written about the history of art and cybernetics in essays including \\"Cybernetics and Art: Cultural Convergence in the 1960s\\" and \\"From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott\\"(2003), which traces the trajectory of Ascott's work from cybernetic art to telematic art (art using computer networking as its medium, a precursor to net.art.) Audio feedback and the use of tape loops, sound synthesis and computer generated compositions reflected a cybernetic awareness of information, systems and cycles. Such techniques became widespread in the 1960s in the music industry. The visual effects of electronic feedback became a focus of artistic research in the late 1960s, when video equipment first reached the consumer market. Steina and Woody Vasulka, for example, used \\"all manner and combination of audio and video signals to generate electronic feedback in their respective of corresponding media.\\"Edward A. Shanken, \\"From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott,\\" in Roy Ascott (2003, 2007), Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness, University of California, . With related work by Edward Ihnatowicz, Wen-Ying Tsai and cybernetician Gordon Pask and the animist kinetics of Robert Breer and Jean Tinguely, the 1960s produced a strain of cyborg art that was very much concerned with the shared circuits within and between the living and the technological. A line of cyborg art theory also emerged during the late 1960s. Writers like Jonathan Benthall and Gene Youngblood drew on cybernetics and cybernetic. The most substantial contributors here were the British artist and theorist Roy Ascott with his essay \\"Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision\\" in the journal Cybernetica (1976), and the American critic and theorist Jack Burnham. In \\"Beyond Modern Sculpture\\" from 1968 he builds cybernetic art into an extensive theory that centers on art's drive to imitate and ultimately reproduce life.Mitchell Whitelaw (2004), Metacreation: Art and Artificial Life, MIT Press, p.17-18. Leading art theorists and historians in this field include Christiane Paul (curator), Frank Popper, Christine Buci- Glucksmann, Dominique Moulon, Robert C.

Following his kidnapping by Apaches as a child, he was raised as one and became a warrior. Later he joined the US Army's Apache scouts, serving at Fort Verde between December 1874 and May 1878 and was given the nickname Mickey Free. Early life Telles' mother was Maria Jesus Martinez, a Mexican woman. His father was Santiago Telles. As sixteen-year-olds the two met and fell in love but Telles did not marry Maria Jesus, perhaps because of resistance from Santiago's parents. His given name at birth was Felix. In 1858, Maria Jesus and her two children, Felix and his half-sister, Teodora Rangel, met and moved in with John Ward,Arizona Highway, PDF, pg. 25, 28-29, July 2003 an Irishman who had migrated to the Arizona Territory and started a ranch. The August 26, 1860 United States Census for the Sonoita Creek settlement in the Arizona Territory indicates that Felix Ward was 12 years old, his sister Teodora was 10, and his sister Mary Ward was 5 months. Maria Jesus Martinez was listed as 30 years old and John Ward as 54 years old. A half-brother, Santiago Ward, later claimed his birth as July 25, 1860, but this contradicts the census record. John Ward and María Jesús had five children before his death in 1867. Capture by the Apaches Felix was abducted at age 12 on January 27, 1861, by a Pinal Apache raiding party. He was later traded to the Coyotero Apache, who are also known as White Mountain Apaches. The kidnapping had lasting implications for relations between the Apache and the United States. John Ward was away from his home on Sonoita Creek on business. Returning home, he learned from neighbors that his cattle and step-son had been taken by Apaches. He went immediately to Lieutenant Colonel Pitcairn Morrison at Fort Buchanan and believing that his stepson had been taken by Chiricahua Apaches, insisted on military intervention. Second Lieutenant George Nicholas Bascom, acting on orders set out on January 28 to find the trail. In the morning he could not locate it. In the afternoon, he located a trail leading east toward Chiricahua country and Apache Pass. Bascom, commander of Company C, 7th Infantry, knew from experience that only Chiricahua would go east. What he did not realize was that the opening of Fort Breckinridge on Aravaipa Creek and the San Pedro River in the Pinal homeland was forcing all raiders to go east. The events which followed became known as the Bascom Affair and triggered the Chiricahua Wars. On 4 February 1861, on orders to retrieve the child at all costs, Bascom went to Apache Pass to seek out Cochise, son-in-law of Mangas Coloradas. Cochise said he didn't have the child but thought he knew who did and if given ten days could bring him in. Bascom had the Apaches surrounded, informing Cochise they would be held as hostages until the child was returned. Cochise escaped and captured his own hostages to offer in exchange, but Bascom refused. A series of violent retaliatory actions followed from each side before the Chiricahua Apaches eventually declared war. Telles was adopted and raised by Nayundiie, a White Mountain Apache, and became foster brother to Tlol-dil-zil, later known as John Rope. Scout for the US Army He joined the U.S. Army's Apache Scouts on 2 December 1872 as a scout and within two years he was promoted to the rank of sergeant. He was posted to Camp Verde to serve as an interpreter, where he met Al Sieber. Because the soldiers could not pronounce the Scouts' names, they gave them nicknames. Due to his red hair and other features, the soldiers claimed the scout named Feliz, bore a resemblance to a character in Charles Lever's 1840 novel, Charles O'Malley: The Irish Dragoon named \\"Mickey Free\\". Free served as a scout for George Crook in the pursuit of Geronimo and Nana. He accompanied Crook on his expedition to the Sierra Madres in 1883 and accompanied Chatto and other Apaches on a visit to Washington, D.C. in 1886. He left the scouts in 1893. In his time as a bounty hunter, Free tracked the Apache Kid, who at one point had a $15,000 reward on his head. Later life and death After leaving the Army, Free moved to the Fort Apache Indian Reservation with the remainder of the White Mountain Apache Scouts and lived out the rest of his life as a farmer until his death in 1914. He married four times and had two sons and two daughters.

It was a successful coal mining town for decades.Parker, Watson, and Hugh K. Lambert. Black Hills Ghost Towns. First ed. Vol. 1. Chicago, IL: The Swallow Press Incorporated, 1974. 54-56. 1 vols. Print. History =Founding= Cambria started out as a mining town. It is possible that the coal in the area was used by early Western settlers to heat their homes. After the American Civil War, demand for coal skyrocketed as railroads began westward expansion. The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad stopped its westward expansion in Alliance, Nebraska, due to high eastern coal costs. Kilpatrick Brothers & Collins (KB&C;) sent prospectors into the Black Hills to search for coal in the hopes of securing a railroad contract with the railroad. In 1887, high-grade anthracite deposits were discovered by Frank Mondell inside Coal Creek Canyon or Little Oil Creek Canyon, Wyoming. This area was renamed Cambria Canyon. The Cambria Fuel Company was founded by KB&C; with Frank Mondell as its manager. The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad signed the contract and laid tracks north from Newcastle, Wyoming to the new mine, which were completed in 1889. =Life in Cambria= KB&C; took over the building of Cambria. One of the first buildings was a hospital with four beds, an operation room, and eventually an x-ray room. The company also built a deep well that could pump of water per day and used compressed air to bring the water to the top; a reservoir; a school; three churches; two hotels (one of which was three stories high); a lodge hall; a bank; a courthouse; offices; a concert band; a boarding house for bachelor workers; an opera house, which once sold out a production of Faust; a recreation building that included billiard and pool tables and a bowling alley; and about 150 houses for miners and their families. There was a commissary store at which Company script could be used. The company issued small, cheap coins called \\"clackers\\", so named for the noise they made. This store was even visited by people who were not from the Black Hills. In June 1889, the first property patents were signed to Joseph M. and Robert J. Kilpatrick. A post office was added in 1890. As the town grew, several other stores sprang up, many of which had false fronts. A cemetery was located northeast of town. Many deaths in Cambria resulted from disease (most of these victims were children) and mining disasters. The mining company later placed a prohibition on all alcohol stronger than beer, and saloons and dance halls were banned. This resulted in bootlegging. Fatal brawls were not uncommon in the town. However, a daily beer wagon arrived from Newcastle to satisfy the miners. The first Catholic church service in Cambria was held in 1891 and was led by Reverend P. Cassidy, a resident of Hot Springs, South Dakota. The church services were attended by members of several different denominations. The St. James Roman Catholic Church was constructed by Reverend P. J. Lynch in 1903, under a 99-year lease from the company that cost $2,000. Cambria was also home to an Episcopal church, which was once visited by Ethelbert Talbot. The Grand Lodge was home to three fraternities: the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Knights of Pythias, and the Improved Order of Red Men, which was not added until 1894. This hall also included a swimming pool and gym. Among the more famous members of the Hall were Solomon Star, the business partner of Seth Bullock; Edward McDonald, the sheriff of Lawrence County, South Dakota, mayor of Deadwood, South Dakota, and secretary of the Deadwood Lodge; and J. F. Edmonds, the Past Grand Chancellor and Past Grand Prelate of Dakota Territory. In 1904, the Cambria Coal Company announced that the population of the town was about 1,400, but the official 1900 census counted 966 residents. In 1923, the company started building a small resort facility known as Cambria Casino Park, which would cost $250,000 to finish. Construction was completed in 1928. =The mining operations= In 1878, James LeGraves began panning for salt on Salt Creek, Wyoming. This salt pan was , and the site became famous as salt licks for deer where his wagons stopped. The salt was mainly used for chlorination of the gold ore. However, the salt was impure, and his operation failed. The Cambria Fuel Company, which consisted of six mines built throughout the valley, began operation on December 4, 1889. The mining equipment was shipped from Nebraska using wagon trains and lowered into place by block and tackle. The coal was hauled using trestles and grounded railroad tracks that connected to bins, which were located over the central railroad. 74 beehive ovens were built to convert waste coal into coke, which was then shipped to smelters throughout the Black Hills. The boilers were emptied by an electric conveyor system, and could only be operated by one person. At one point, the coke was worth $5.60 a ton in gold. Cambria coal included small amounts of gold ore, which sold for $2 per ton. Horses and mules were brought into town for mine use by a KB&C-owned; ranch. An electrical system was installed, which was powered by 1,800 horsepower steam engines. One of the first requirements to work in the mine was to buy a homestead adjacent to the mine and then sell the property and mineral rights to the Cambria Fuel Company. Through this method, the company eventually accumulated 17,000 acres. The company later contracted workers from Sicily, Greece, Macedonia, Slovenia, and other European countries. The company paid for their passage to the United States and gave them clothing and housing. Between 1900 and 1904, about 550-750 men were working at the mine. In 1907, the Cambria Salt Company opened in an attempt to revive the old salt mines, but the operation failed within four years. In 1910, KB&C; sold the mines to investors in the East. Overall, the Cambria Fuel Company produced about 13 million tons of bituminous coal worth $20 million. =Decline and abandonment of Cambria= By 1928, the anthracite vein had been thinned down to less than three feet. In February 1928, Cambria Fuel Company announced the closing of the mine by April 1, unless new deposits were found. At 4:30 P.M. on March 15, 1928,Cox, Earl. \\"Cambria was a company town.\\" Deadwood Magazine 2002. Web. 20 Aug. 2013. the whistle blew for the final time and reportedly sounded the disaster warning, which consisted of a series of short blasts. According to legend, the town went into a sort of chaos. Many miners didn't pack up their belongings before they left to find new work. Other miners, sure the mine would reopen, went on vacation. By the evening, the shop owners and clerks had left town. The town was deserted so quickly that the courthouse lawn sprinkler was said to have been left running until the reservoir was emptied. However, the exodus was not actually that quick. Closing ceremonies were done on April 28, 1928. Cambrians marked the occasion with a dance, music, and speeches. The post office was discontinued on December 31, 1928. The Cambria Casino Park was sold to Cambria Park Commissioners; the facility survived until 1932, when it was leased. In 1929, the railroad tracks were removed by the company with the permission of the Interstate Commerce Commission.Lee, Russell. \\"Cambria.\\" Wyoming Tales and Trails. N.p., n.d. Web. 21 Aug. 2013. Several buildings were sold and their businesses moved. Others were salvaged for lumber or vandalized. The town wasn't thoroughly dismantled until World War II. =Today= The Cambria Casino Park is now a resort sometimes leased to the Flying V Ranch, and still operates as a bed and breakfast known as the Flying V Cambria Inn. Several houses are still standing on the site today. The home of the superintendent, the church steeple, the mule stables, the bank and office vaults, a few garages, many mine buildings, and cold cellars are also among the ruins. The 365 steps leading up to where the school and residential area once stood are still intact. Clearings through the trees mark where the paths and roads were. Geography Cambria was located north of Newcastle, just off U.S. Highway 85. Demographics In 1895, Cambria had a population of 329. In 1900, official U.S. Census records counted 966 people living in Cambria, but the company reported an approximate number of 1,400. In 1904, somewhere between 550 and 750 men were employed at the site. In 1928, the town became abandoned.

The intention is that by showing the flag of a country regarded favorably by the region they are visiting, they will receive friendlier treatment or service than they might otherwise have encountered. Origin The term flag-jacking gained additional popularity after an article entitled \\"How to Spot Flag-Jacking Frauds Abroad\\" was published on 1 July 2013 by The Huffington Post. The article stated that flag-jacking is a transitory act involving a person's use of a country's flag to create the false impression of being a citizen of a favored nation. The most common situation, according to the article, is when Americans pose as Canadians. Instances of flag-jacking date to the late 1990s. Identification Business Insider, CNN, FlightNetwork, and The Huffington Post have claimed it is possible to identify flag jackers by analysing their body language. In honor of Canada Day in 2013, FlightNetwork and their PR Agency (Pointman News Creation) commissioned Mark Bowden (of Truthplane) a top international body language expert, to provide humorous tips on how Americans can pass themselves off as Canadians by adopting gestures that he termed the \\"Maple-o-gy\\", the \\"Canuck Crinkle\\", the \\"Toque Tilt\\", the \\"Stars and Gripes Forever\\", the \\"Polka-Loon\\" and the \\"American Psycho\\".

It proved successful, with 80 completed by January 2011. Since 1995 Chernov's designs have either been built by the Gidroplan (Hydroplane) Company or by Gidrosamolet. The wing of the Korvet has no sweep and is of constant chord, with 1.5° dihedral; its thick airfoil section has a thickness-to-chord ratio of 0.15. It is a single spar, riveted duralumin covered structure, apart from its full span slotted flaperons, which are fabric covered, and GFRP sandwich, down turned, buoyant wing tips which support the wings when the aircraft is moored. Later aircraft have remodelled tips which include integral miniature float bodies to provide stability at speed on the water; they may also have separate flaps and ailerons. The wing is braced to the mid-fuselage by a single streamlined strut on each side, with the assistance of jury struts. Cabane struts carry the wing over the cabin. The tail unit is a GFRP structure with a straight edged, tapered, swept fin and balanced rudder which carries the unswept, straight edged tailplane, braced from above, a little above the upper fuselage line. The elevators are split by the rudder; the port surface has a trim tab. Different variants of the Korvet have been fitted with several different engine types; some have a single engine and some are twins. In all cases the engines are mounted over and above the wing leading edge. Twins have their engines as close together as the propellers diameters will allow. Most engines have been from the Rotax range: the Rotax 503 UL-2V and the Rotax 582 UL two cylinder two strokes, the first air-cooled and the latter with mixed air and water cooling, and the Rotax 912 UL water-cooled flat four. The Jabiru 2200 has also been fitted. Some drive two blade propellers, though others have three blades. The Korvet's fuselage is a flat sided, two step hull design, built from GFRP. The cabin is completely enclosed in a blister canopy which is all transparent apart from the underwing roof, giving all round views. Entry is by upward canopy sections on each side. The flying boat can be equipped as an amphibian with short spring cantilever legs with small mainwheels, the legs rotating through 90° for water touch-downs. There is a small tailwheel below the rudder. Skis are another option. Operational history The first delivery of a Korvet was in 1990, when a pre-production aircraft went to a forest control organization. The first production aircraft flew in 1993, four years after the prototype. After receiving Russian certification at the end of 2001 and JAR/FAR certification a few months later, the Korvet sold quite well, with 60 built by the end of February 2002. An early Korvet 582 was sold in the Philippines, then bought by the Vietnamese and used as a model for the locally built A41 Factory VNS-41. Two Korvet-Js went to Cuba in military markings in 2008. Another Korvet-J was equipped for Earth resource survey with large underwing aerials; after successful trials these aerials were internally accommodated. By January 2011, eighty had been sold, the most recent to Costa Rica. Of the eighty built, seventeen were Jabiru powered. As well as selling flyaway aircraft, Gidroplan also sell kits in different stages of finish.

Biography Marie de Heredia was the second of three daughters of Cuban-born French poet José-Maria de Heredia, and from an early age she mixed with many writers and artists that came to her father's house, including Leconte de Lisle, Anna de Noailles, Paul Valéry, Pierre Louÿs and Anatole France.Tama Lea Engelking, ‘The Secret Rebellion of a Literary Daughter: The Poetry of Gérard d'Houville’, French Literary Series vol. XVI, 1989 Her private life was somewhat convoluted. She married poet Henri de Régnier, but had a long-term relationship with Pierre Louÿs, who was probably the father of her son Pierre de Régnier (1898–1943). She also took several other lovers, including Edmond Jaloux, Jean-Louis Vaudoyer, Gabriele D'Annunzio (during his exile in Paris from 1910 to 1914), and dramatist Henri Bernstein. Her association with openly lesbian colleagues also led to rumours about her own sexuality. Works Though sometimes better known for her liaisons with other artists, Marie de Régnier was a very accomplished poet and novelist in her own right, \\"considered one of the most gifted of the bevy of women writers that her age produced\\". Her first attempts at poetry were written at the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal, where her father was a director. He and his friends encouraged her talents from a very young age, and she eventually began publishing under her married name, later taking the masculine-sounding pseudonym \\"Gérard d'Houville\\" (derived from the name of a Norman grandmother, \\"Louise Gérard d'Houville\\" or \\"Girard d'Ouville\\"Norman R. Shapiro (Ed.), French Women Poets of Nine Centuries, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008, ). She later said her use of a pen-name was a way of distancing herself from her more famous husband and father, but it was not a serious attempt to disguise her sex: contemporary critics and commentators always referred to \\"Madame\\" Gérard d'Houville. Her work appeared notably in the Revue des deux Mondes from 1894 and was widely admired, with some critics comparing her favourably to Mallarmé. Many of these poems have still not been collected into a modern edition. Her first novel, L'Inconstante, appeared in 1903. Critical reception and legacy Marie de Régnier posing for her portrait in the workshop of Jacques-Émile Blanche, 1893. Photograph by Giuseppe Primoli. De Heredia's work was acclaimed throughout her career and she was a popular writer with the public as well as critics. When French newspaper L'Intransigeant asked readers in 1910 to name the top three female writers deserving of a place in the Académie française, \\"Gérard d'Houville\\" was placed in top position, above Anna de Noailles and Colette.Jennifer E. Milligan, The Forgotten Generation: French Women Writers of the Inter-war Period, Berg Publishers 1996, In 1918 she was the recipient of the Académie française's inaugural Grand Prix de Littérature, awarded for her fiction, and in 1958 she was also given the Académie's Grand Prix de Poésie for her poetic oeuvre – to this day the only woman to have received both awards. Several artists and painters of the time took her portrait, including Jacques-Émile Blanche and Jean-Louis Forain. She was also the subject of several of Pierre Louÿs's nude photographs.

She is an campaigner for a peaceful and equitable world, a human rights and social justice advocate, and works to empower women and girls.  Personal life and background  Rainatou was born in the mining town of Fria. At the age of 12 she began teaching evening classes to girls unable to go to school, and later engaged with the political system, becoming a member of the Guinean children's parliament as minister for children and Women's affairs, including appearances on Guinean radio and television. Rainatou gained a Master's degree in International Law at l'Université Kofi Annan de Guinée, and a Master's degree in International Relations at London Metropolitan University. She is fluent in French, English, Pulaar and Susu.  Early political activities  Rainatou held several positions in Guinea, including with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), World Health Organization and UNICEF. After moving to New York in 2009, Rainatou took an internship at the WILPF Peacewomen Project, working exclusively on United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325: a resolution adopted in 2000 calling for women's rights to be respected in conflict.  Foundation of Make Every Woman Count  Inspired by the activities at Peacewoman, and motivated by the African Union naming 2010-2020 \\"The African Women's Decade\\", Rainatou founded a new organisation to provide news and resources for African Women, both those in Africa and those living abroad in the Diaspora. Aimed at promoting the theme for the African Women's Decade, this online resource centre began collating news events from across the continent, and providing self-published articles highlighting the work of grassroots organisations, together with interviews with successful women. On returning to the United Kingdom in 2011, Rainatou applied for Make Every Woman Count to become a registered charity, a status it achieved on 13 October that year. Since founding the organisation, Rainatou has expanded the team to include a diverse range of volunteers from around the world.  Beliefs and inspirations  Talking to CNN, Rainatou gave the reasons for her dedication to the African Women's Decade: \\"Basically, when they launched African Women's Decade it was in Nairobi; you had people from all over [the world] coming, delegates, African governments, it was a big feast. But then after a few months you hardly heard about it - because of the credit crunch basically we didn't hear about financing going into women's projects there and it was really calm. So we thought what can we do? Are we going to sit down and let this decade pass away, or are we going to do something, mainly us as the younger generation\\". She was motivated by her vision that one day all women will have voice in governance institutions and fully participate equally in public dialogue and decision making. In her interview with Women 4 Africa she said: \\"Most International organizations focused on empowering and gaining the equal rights of women often neglect the voices of African women themselves\\".  Recognition and awards  Rainatou was awarded 'Inspirational Women of the Year' in 2012 by Women for Africa, in recognition of her work promoting the African Women's Decade, and was featured in the '20 Youngest Power Women in Africa' by Forbes Magazine. She was recognized in 2013 by THE BUZZ in the Equality for all among the 'Eight Foreign Women's Equality Activists To Know'  Media appearances  Justina Mutale, Rainatou Sow, Naana Otoo-Oyortey and Dr Anouka van Eerdewijk Rainatou has appeared on CNN's African Voices show, being interviewed at the publication event for the organisation's annual report.

The Sotiates were a Gallic- Aquitani tribe, dwelling in the region surrounding Sos (Lot-et-Garonne). They are mentioned by Julius Caesar in the Commentarii de Bello Gallico, his firsthand account of the Gallic Wars, where he narrates the expedition of P. Licinius Crassus to Aquitania.  Name  They are mentioned as Sotiates (var. sontiates, sociates) by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC),Caesar. Commentarii de Bello Gallico, 3:20:3; 3:21:1 and as Sottiates by Pliny (1st c. AD).Pliny. Naturalis Historia, 4:108 The meaning of the name Sotiates is unclear. The suffix is possibly the Gaulish -ates ('belonging to'), which appears in the names of many Gallic tribes across Europe (e.g., Atrebates, Nantuates, Caeracates). The origin of the first element Soti- is unknown. The city of Sos, attested as oppidum Sotiatum in the 1st c. BCE (archidiaconatus Socientis in the late 13th c. CE) is named after the tribe.  Culture  The ethnic identity of the Sotiates is debated. Their lifestyle was very similar to that of the Gauls, which led some scholars to postulate that they were originally a Gallic people that had settled at the frontier of Aquitania. In the mid-first century BCE, led by their chief Adiatuanos, the Sotiates fought alone against the Roman armies of Crassus, whereas other Aquitani tribes had formed a coalition against the foreign invader. Furthermore, the name Adiatuanos is probably related to the Gaulish adiantu- ('eagerness, desire, ambition'; perhaps cognate with the Middle Welsh add-iant 'wish'), and thus may be translated as 'zealously striving (for rulership)'. Caesar mentions that their chief was protected by a troop of 600 men named soldurii, which could be a Latinized form of Gaulish soldurio ('body-guard, loyal, devoted') according to Xavier Delamarre. Theo Vennemann argues on the contrary that the name may be of Aquitanian (Vasconic) origin, since it is used by the local people (illi), and the first element of sol-durii could be related to the Basque zor ('debt'). In any case, the soldurii of Adiatuanos were probably involved in a patron-client relationship that has been compared to the Gallic ambactus, and the size of his army (600 men) illustrates the concentration of a personal power ruling over different clans. They may also have been an Aquitanian tribe that had been Celticized before Caesar's first historical accounts. A sword found in a funeral near Sotiatum and dated to the 3rd century BCE attests the diffusion of prestigious items of Celtic (La Tène) type among the local population. Joaquín Gorrochategui notes that the province of Aquitania experienced \\"a profound Gallic influence, which becomes more evident as one moves away from the Pyrenees northwards and eastwards. Evidence of this penetration are the names of Gallic persons and deities, the names of tribes in -ates, and later the Romance toponyms in -ac\\".  Geography  Their capital was the oppidum Sotiatum (Sot(t)ium; present-day Sos), located at the confluence of the Gueyze and Gélise rivers.  History  The Sotiates are mentioned in two classical sources: Caesar's Bellum Gallicum and Cassius Dio's History of Rome.Julius Caesar. Bellum Gallicum. 3, 20–22.Cassius Dio. Ῥωμαϊκὴ Ἱστορία (Historia Romana). 39, 46. = Gallic Wars (58–50 BC) = In 56 BCE, the Sotiates were led by their chief Adiatuanos in the defence of their oppidum against the Roman officer P.

Life  Born in Riga, Edgars Vinters was the only child of the facade and decoration painter Hermanis Vinters (1874–1939) and his wife Anna, née Kalniņa, (1879–1953). As a ten-year-old boy he met with the popular pastelist Voldemārs Irbe, who detected the boy’s talent, taught him the basics of pastel painting and opened his eyes to the beauty of nature in its so-called minor details. From 1935 on, he wrote small articles for children's and youth magazines, which he illustrated with pen and ink drawings and linocuts.Journal Cīrulītis, 1934 to 1938: * Pen drawing of fifteen year old Edgars Vinters. * Linocut illustrating a Latvian poem (Daina): (Sadly cry the sparrows / When they see me threshing / Don't cry, little sparrows/ There still remains a lot). * Pen drawing illustrating popular song Tumšā nakte, zaļā zālē (\\"Dark night, green grass\\"). * Pen drawing Island in lake „Baltezers“ . * Linocut Portrait of Martin Luther. * Linocut Portrait of composer Jāzeps Vītols. Journal Skolu Dzīve, January to December 1936: * Linocut Portrait of theologian and linguist Gotthard Friedrich Stender * Pen drawing My house * Violinist E. Vinters plays an own composition Memories of childhood * Illustration to Christmas evening. With the money he made, he contributed to the school fee for the commercial college he attended until 1940, after a change of school. Resulting from contact he made with the painter Hugo Kārlis Grotuss, from 1937 Vinters changed his painting style. Grotuss encouraged him to give up ‘the dark phase’ he was in through Irbe, to use brighter primers and to show more briskness and colours in his paintings. A porcelain factory engaged him to paint a series of porcelain plates for president Kārlis Ulmanis. After he had taken his high-school-diploma, he joined the Latvian Art Academy and until 1944 studied under the professors Jānis Kuga, Leo Svemps, Jānis Cielavs, Valdemārs Tone, Jānis Annuss, Kārlis Miesnieks und Vilhelms Purvītis. In 1944, Vinters had to drop out of his studies; he was drafted for the service in the Latvian Legion and deployed near Toruń on the Vistula River. In 1945 he was taken prisoner of war by the Soviet Army and deported to a POW camp near Moscow. There Russian officers made out his artistic abilities and facilitated the establishment of an atelier. During this time Vinters made a series of drawings and paintings, which he for the first time showed to an art lover, who had worked about his life and his works and which were published in an art book in 2012. Back in Riga in 1947, he could teach art and drafting at a secondary school. At the same time, he attended Janis Rozentāls Art Highschool and got his qualifications in teaching in 1949.  Work  Vinters painted objectively, mostly landscape painting. Early works from childhood and youth were made with pencil and ink pen; later, for a short time he made linocuts and pastel works and then found his means of painting, his favorite being oil painting. Frequently in his craft he made aquarelles and, as a speciality during the 1970s, monotypes. But oil painting remained his prime means of expression for his interpretations of his beloved Latvian landscapes during the seasons, of flowers and townscapes. During the time of the German occupation, Vinters published drawings and aquarelles in German Journals.Journal \\"Deutsche Zeitung im Ostland \\" from December 1941 to April 1942: * Pen drawing Brook in winter * Pen drawing Forest lake in winter. * Aquarelle Country path. * Pen drawing Time of snow melting. * Pen drawing Light lake in spring time.

He was born in Tokyo, Japan, and grew up in Taiwan and the United States. Lin is considered a leading Taiwanese contemporary painter and conceptual artist. Biography Lin was born in Tokyo in 1964 to a Taiwanese family, and raised in Taiwan. His family immigrated to Los Angeles in 1973, during a time of political uncertainty for Taiwan. Lin embraced the multiculturalism of Southern California, and took an interest in its art and skateboarding scenes. Lin graduated from Otis Art Institute of Parsons School of Design, Los Angeles in 1990, and obtained an MFA from Art Center College of Design, Pasadena in 1993. He counted among his influences the artists Daniel Buren, Dan Graham, and Franz West, the essayist Elaine Scarry and her work on culture in the body, and Taiwanese New Wave Cinema directors such as Hou Hsiao-hsien, Tsai Ming-liang, and Edward Yang. Lin has worked as an artist in Taipei, Paris, Brussels, and Shanghai. He currently lives and works in Brussels and Taipei. Career PALAIS DE TOKYO 22.01-22.8.2002, 2002 (Emulsion on wood). Palais de Tokyo, Paris, France. Permanent installation, 2007. Rogaland School of Art, Stavanger, Norway =1993–2000= Lin moved to Taipei from Los Angeles in 1993. The artist Richard Lin, a relative on his father's side, became an important early mentor. For two years Lin worked as a bartender at the independent artist-run IT Park Gallery (伊通公園), where he met a group of like-minded artists and launched his career. Lin's first solo exhibition, Meander (IT Park, 1994), featured monochrome steel panels spray-painted at an auto body shop. Lin had been exposed to industrial and automotive design at art school, where he adopted the materials and techniques for painting with car lacquer and spray guns. However, he did not find the Taipei audience as receptive to his work's minimalist aesthetic rooted in Los Angeles car culture. Lin responded to the challenge of audience communication with Interior (IT Park, 1996). He modeled a domestic setting in the gallery space by re-locating some of his home furnishings, including two carpets, a stereo, and his music collection, with a sign that read, \\"Please remove your shoes before stepping on to the carpet. Feel free to choose from the selection of music.\\" Lin opened a dialog between the public space of the gallery and the private space of the home, to address the gap between his and his audience's conceptions of contemporary art. This initiated the role of the public in Lin's work, his concept of artist as host and audience as guest, and his approach of creating participatory artwork using everyday objects. Interior was Lin's first exhibition to feature paintings with flower motifs. He had chanced upon embroidered muslin pillowcases in his home, and recalled the traditional floral patterns from his youth in the countryside, where they would adorn the bedding given as part of a wedding dowry. He crafted frames the same size as the pillows, copied their patterns and projected them onto a canvas, and reproduced them as colorful paintings. With House (Bamboo Curtain Studio, 1998), Lin began working on an architectural scale, filling an entire wall of the exhibition space with a 45 square meter floral patterned mural. Complementary (Dimension Endowment of Art, 1998) paired paintings of pillowcases with a raised tatami mat featuring real pillows. This public resting place created a kind of \\"social sculpture\\", and Lin removed a wall to let in natural light. Untitled–Cigarette Break (IT Park, 1999) featured flower print paintings and a pair of Le Corbusier LC-2 chairs partially upholstered with the same patterns, as a critique of the relationship between art, design, and architecture, and the opposition of ornamentation with modernism. Lin continued to explore the role of the public and the environment in his work. For Imported (La Ferme du Buisson, 1998), he replicated a scenario from his hometown daily life by installing tables and stools and offering hundreds of cigarettes and bottles of Taiwan Beer to visitors, framed by billboards for the brands. Lin's contribution to the group show Tu parles/J'écoute (Taipei Fine Arts Museum, 1998) invited the other artists to document the lighting conditions for their artworks, and integrated their drawings and descriptions into a new multimedia work with sound samples of museum visitor announcements. Lin was invited to participate in the 2000 Taipei Biennial, The Sky is the Limit, curated by Jérôme Sans and Manray Hsu. He created a \\"social space\\" in the entrance hall of the Taipei Fine Arts Museum, deploying a large-scale floor painting decorated with phoenix and peony motifs and furnished with cushions bearing the same pattern. =2001–2005= After 2000, Lin received numerous invitations to exhibit his work abroad. He represented Taiwan at the 2001 Venice Biennale, and participated in the 2001 Istanbul Biennial and the 2002 Gwangju Biennale. He continued to create installations for museums, such as such as Kiasma Day Bed (Kiasma, 2001), and for large public spaces, such as ATRIUM STADHUIS DEN HAAG, 12.07-08.09.2002 (The Hague City Hall, 2002). Lin moved his studio to Paris in 2002. That year he was commissioned by Nicolas Bourriaud and Jérôme Sans to create a site-specific installation and floor painting for the café lounge at Palais de Tokyo. Bourriaud and Sans invited Lin to the 2005 Biennale de Lyon, where he covered La Sucrière in a 100 square meter mural of an enlarged wallpaper pattern. He followed this up with Notre Histoire (Palais de Tokyo, 2006), featuring a large mural painting from a cartoon image. For Grind (MoMA PS1, 2004), Lin installed an indoors skateboard half-pipe decorated with a floral motif, and presented a similar work based on a traditional design from the Shanghai fabric market at the group show Odyssey (Shanghai Gallery of Art, 2004). At Kunsthalle Wien in 2005, Lin covered the windows with decorative patterns but left the gallery space empty, transforming the glass pavilion into an enormous oriental lamp. =2006–2015= What a Difference a Day Made, 2008. 10th Biennale de Lyon. A Modest Veil, 2010. Vancouver Art Gallery, Vancouver, Canada. Utah Sky 2065-40 (blue curve), 2015. High Museum of Art, Atlanta, GA. Lin moved to Shanghai in 2006, and continued to explore themes of personal, cultural, and political identity through his artwork. Island Life (2006, Eslite Gallery) presented paintings based on Uyghur and Tibetan carpets alongside a painting of a Tai Bao Zheng, a travel permit for Taiwanese to enter mainland China. I am the Sun (2009, Eslite Gallery) featured paintings based on suncake logos and elementary school workbooks, and large tangram- shaped paintings of Bambi. Concurrent to the exhibition, Lin wrapped thousands of books at the Eslite Bookstore in Taipei in pink paper bearing phoenix and peony motifs, in a work titled \\"21.2.1972\\" after Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. Lin opened a number of exhibitions that did not feature his signature floral paintings. For What a Difference a Day Made (Shanghai Gallery of Art, 2008), Lin bought out an entire daily goods store, cataloguing and arranging its contents for viewing in the gallery. He later presented the work at the 2009 Biennale de Lyon and the 2011 Singapore Biennale. For Place Libre (Tang Contemporary, 2013), he used a minimal paint scheme to transform the gallery into a free parking lot. Lin's exhibition A Modest Veil (Vancouver Art Gallery, 2010) installed large floral paintings on the façade of the museum. He collaborated with the architecture firm Atelier Bow-Wow and video artist Cheng Ran on Model Home: A Proposition by Michael Lin (Rockbund Art Museum, 2012). They created a temporary workers' dormitory, and painted the museum interior with a pattern borrowed from bedding used by laborers in Shanghai, while filming the whole process. They adapted the work for the 2013 Auckland Triennial, using a paper building technique in place of welded steel, and participated in Frieze London 2014. For FreePort [No. 005]: Michael Lin (Peabody Essex Museum, 2012), Lin turned to patterns from coats of arms to decorate the museum floors and walls, and installed hundreds of mass-produced copies of an early Chinese porcelain depiction of a European. At the 2013 California-Pacific Triennial, Lin showed an acrylic mural titled \\"Sharawadgi\\", based on a Chinoiserie portrayal of Chinese garden features. In 2015, he re- staged his installation from Interior (1996) for the ASIA NOW Paris Asian Art Fair, created a site-specific work for the SCAD Museum of Art, and presented \\"Utah Sky 2065-40 (blue curve)\\" at the High Museum of Art. =2016–present= Lin left Shanghai in 2016, splitting his time between Taipei and Brussels. His exhibition A Tale of Today (LEO XU Projects, 2016) featured a row of vintage Shanghai Forever bicycles, and walls painted with patterns and designs borrowed from the bicycle frames. New Paradise (Eslite Gallery, 2016) showed landscape paintings based on the packaging of daily foodstuffs. Lin worked with local communities and art college students in Manila on his exhibition Locomotion (MCAD Manila, 2016). He exchanged tarps that adorn neighborhood pedicabs for ones of his own design. The used tarps, a local design tradition, were showcased in the exhibition, while the artist-designed ones were ridden around the city. In 2017, the National Gallery of Victoria commissioned a floor painting, titled \\"Federation\\", which Lin painted in collaboration with local artists, and Chiostro del Bramante featured a floor painting for the group exhibition Enjoy. The following year, Lin collaborated with Swiss visual artist Beat Streuli on the architectural and curatorial project Opening (Taiwan Contemporary Culture Lab, 2018) and the exhibition One Plus One (Eslite Gallery, 2018). During the 2019 Art Basel Hong Kong, BANK exhibited works by Michael Lin together with those of Richard Lin (who died in 2011). At the same time, the Centre for Heritage, Arts and Textile (CHAT) in Hong Kong commissioned a site-specific work, a set of large curtains for their lounge. Back in Taipei, Lin created a public installation 24/7 (Taipei Fine Arts Museum, 2019) featuring raised tatami mats, walls and cushions colored after Taiwanese convenience stores, and paper lamps by Isamu Noguchi. In 2020, Lin presented a digital artwork based on traditional Taiwanese window patterns, which was displayed on the side of the Taipei 101 skyscraper in conjunction with the second edition of Taipei Dangdai art fair. He also completed a 1300 square meter floor painting for the plaza and ground floor of Museo Jumex, derived from a popular Mexican tablecloth pattern. =Commercial work= Lin has undertaken a number of collaborations with luxury fashion, furniture, and tableware brands. He has worked with Italian furniture manufacturer Moroso and the fashion house Dolce and Gabbana, and created store interiors for Louis Vuitton. Lin has designed a series of cups for illy, and key cards for several Le Méridien hotels. Many of his exhibitions feature artist's multiples and design objects, which re-conceive the museum and gallery shops as an extension of his art practice. In 2008, Lin contributed a floral mosaic flooring to the Chanel Mobile Art Pavilion, a portable exhibition hall designed by Zaha Hadid which was shown in Tokyo and New York. Critical Reception Lin is associated with the generation of artists who are invested in the philosophy of Relational Aesthetics, but he also concerns himself with the regional cultural topography and works in the local vernacular. He started developing a reputation in the late 1990s for his use of vast expanse of bold flowers, a visual motif that is characteristic of the endemic culture of Taiwan. His floral patterns, imitating embroideries that would typically adorn Taiwanese pillows, are inspired by the vicissitudes in the domestic and political climates of Taiwan felt by the artist when he returned to the region after many years abroad. His repetitive and ostensibly simple floralscapes, highly attuned to the Taiwanese visual vocabulary, have, however, proved to be the most politically and culturally resonant portion of his work. Lin's work has associations with architecture, as he conceives of his art not merely as a piece of flat canvas, but as a space that the viewers can interact with and within. This idiosyncratic artistic understanding is shown by many of his large-scale installation works, including Model Home: A Proposition by Michael Lin at the Rockbund Art Museum in Shanghai, and Grind at MoMA PS1 in New York.
