Though initial handling problems were partly resolved, the aircraft was deemed too slow and did not go into production. Design and development In late 1932 Lat√©co√®re received an order from the Commission d'examen des Prototypes et Appareils Nouveaux de l'Aeronautique (CEPANA) for a large four-engined floatplane for bomber and torpedo bomber r√¥les. The resulting aircraft, the Lat√©co√®re 550 flew the following year. It was a high-wing monoplane with its four Gn√¥me et Rh√¥ne 9 Kdr radial engines mounted on the wings in tandem, tractor-pusher pairs. Flight 1 February 1934 p. 107 The tractor motors, neatly cowled, projected well clear of the leading edge; the pusher pair were placed in deep cut-outs in the trailing edge. The cowlings of the latter pair were removed after the first few flights to improve cooling. The wing centre section, between the engines, had an all-metal internal structure and the forward part of the skin was also metal, replaced by fabric further aft. The outer wing sections were slightly tapered on the leading edge only, with elliptical tips; they were entirely fabric-covered over a largely wooden structure, though the principal ribs were metal lattices. 6¬∞ of dihedral were added after the first tests. Double ailerons of mixed wood-and-metal construction filled almost all the trailing edges beyond the engine cut-outs. The fuselage was flat-sided and bottomed and only slightly curved on the upper surface. The forward part, from the nose to about midway to the tail was an all-steel structure built on four longerons. Further aft, the longerons continued but were now internally braced with spruce struts and fabric-covered. The forward part was deeper, ending at the rear with an open position for a ventral gunner. At the nose, where the upper fuselage sides curved inwards to an upper gun turret and a navigator's glazed position below, the lower part ended slightly further aft in an enclosure for the bomb aimer. Pilot and co-pilot sat side by side in a glazed cockpit ahead of the leading edge. Behind them, under the same glazing, sat the engineer and the radio operator. Further aft, at the wing trailing edge, was a dorsal gunner's turret. All crew positions were joined by a corridor. The Lat√©co√®re 550 had its tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage, strut braced from below and bearing twin inboard fins and rudders separately braced to the top of the fuselage. During flight trials, these vertical surfaces evolved in stages from a rather blunt shape, with extensions below the tailplane to a surface with a smoothly curved trailing edge entirely above the tailplane. The rudders were fitted with trim tabs. Because of the inboard rudders, the elevators had three sections. The 550 was normally equipped with long, single stepped floats. These were mounted below the engines with four vertical spars per side and braced to the fuselage with a further pair running upwards and inwards. Each float also held the inner ends of a pair of lift struts which joined the outer section of the wing at about mid-span. Between engine, float and fuselage the bracing was complicated by further diagonal struts. The floats were replaced for a time with a pair of single wheels, contained in a streamlined structure strong enough to allow attachment of the same struts that connected to the floats. In this landplane configuration a small steerable tailwheel was added. The split undercarriage allowed the 550 to launch torpedoes and bombs from a longitudinally divided bay beneath the fuselage, with a maximum weapons weight of 1,500 kg (3,100 lbs) and torpedoes carried on the port side. The first flight was made from Lat√©co√®re's marine base at Biscarosse on 29 April 1933 with the 550 in seaplane form. After some modifications to engine cowlings, wings and tail it went to CEPANA at Saint- Rapha√´l, Var for trials in October 1933 and in November was converted, in less than four hours, into a landplane. It was not well received and described as unfit for purpose: instabilities, high control loads and pitching on contact with the water were amongst the criticisms. After modifications, including the final vertical stabiliser changes, the 550 went back to CEPANA in April 1934 in seaplane form. It seems to have handled better, but by now its maximum speed was seen as low; when the sole 550 was lost in October 1934, its port float struts collapsing on alighting, there was no enthusiasm for further development.

Alive training is performed with the intent to win, rather than for mastery or demonstration purposes as in regular sparring, where victory is not an option. Aliveness has also been defined in relation to martial arts techniques as an evaluation of combat effectiveness. Some trainers, like Cus D'Amato, Kevin Rooney, Floyd Mayweather Sr., resort to the alive training, requesting both their trainees and sparring partners to do their best.Mike Tyson - Most Brutal Boxing Sparring Wars Such method became known as the wars in the gym (or sometimes Philly wars by the place they reportedly originated).No Ordinary Joe, p. 298. Others, like Angelo Dundee, prefer rather mild and less extreme methods.Lessons From Angelo Dundee - Training & Technique Components of aliveness Aliveness often attempts to mimic the level of resistance found in the activity the training is intended to prepare a student for, i.e. Hand-to-Hand Combat or Combat sport. According to MMA gym owner Matt Thornton, an Alive training method must incorporate Movement, including spontaneous footwork and the active resistance and intent of all parties during drills or sparring; Timing, in which there is no \\"predictable rhythm... pattern, [or] repeatable series of sets\\" which would lead students away from acquiring applicable skill; and Energy, the practice of committing, with intent and realism, a given technique during sparring, \\"bag work\\" or drills. Matt goes on to say that \\"...there are many things we may do that improve [our] bodies that are not 'Alive'. Its just that all of those things fall under the category of conditioning/exercise... Aliveness comes in when you include a partner.\\" Training benefits Many believe that incorporating Aliveness into training regimens is important, if not a requisite for producing an effective martial artist. Because Alive training involves resisting opponents, sparring sessions produce situations of continuous, un-choreographed attack, an effect which cannot be replicated through the practice of rehearsed routines. Students also learn to deal with the physical pain and stresses involved in combat situations requiring high levels of exertion. Alive training imparts a sense of fluidity and spontaneity; Alive drills do not follow set patterns, and are designed to seamlessly transition from one drill to the next. Not only Tyson's camp resorted for such extremes in the training, as Jesse Ferguson recalled Razor Ruddock (trained by George Chuvalo,) Lennox Lewis and Michael Moorer's camps employed the same philosophy of survival type of fight instead of a regular sparring.Riddick Bowe vs Jesse Ferguson, HBO Program Training methods The Judo practice of Randori has been called an alive training method because of its unpredictability and the intense active resistance by both participants. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu pressure-tests its techniques in an alive setting against resisting opponents. Sparring and competitions in Kyokushin Karate and Sanshou in Chinese martial arts are examples of alive practice. \\"Thai Pad\\" work in Muay Thai conditioning is an alive drill, focusing on dynamic, spontaneous and hard-contact striking training. In the \\"internal\\" Chinese martial arts, the two-person drill Pushing Hands can often be an alive training method that incorporates spontaneous throws and takedowns. In the 1930s, Zhejiang police officer Liu Jinsheng noted a decline in the aliveness of Chinese martial arts practice: As for boxing, it is widely known that daily gym sparrings in Philadelphia, the 'middleweight capital of the world,' were often as tough as most professional fights, the dividends of this approach were that 'Philly warriors' fought with incredible determination and ability to absorb punishment. For that reason some boxers moved to Philadelphia, to spar hard and improve their skills in the toughest way.Punching from the Shadows: Memoir of a Minor League Professional Boxer, 2018, p. 38.

It is located in Farquhar Street, George Town, within the heritage core zone of the city. The church is the third oldest Catholic church in Malaysia. This church was the seat of the bishop of Penang from 1955 to 2003 and it is also a World Heritage Church. History In 1786, Captain Francis Light landed on Penang Island and named it Prince of Wales Island. He set up the Fort Cornwallis. In conjunction with their landing in Penang which coincides with the feast of the Assumption of The Blessed Mary on 15 August that year, he and his companions built a church and named it Church of the Assumption. It was the first Roman Catholic church in the northern region of Malaysia, as well as the first church built after the British landed in Penang. They went on to control Malaya later on. As the population of Penang Island continues to increase, there was a need for a bigger church. In 1860, the present crucifix shaped church, was constructed. It was completed in 1861 and opened. It consists of two bell towers and a huge altar. The pipe organ, by Morton & Moody of Oakham, England, was installed in 1916 and the choir gallery was extended. In December 1941, when the Japanese conquered Penang, the church was closed except for a few masses. It was said that during one day, when the bells of the church were tolled, a Japanese soldier went into the church to cut off the ropes, saying that the bells were noisy. Life went back to normal when the Japanese surrendered in August 1945. In 1954, in conjunction with the Marian Year, the statue of Our Lady of Fatima was carried on a long procession through the streets of George Town. It was replaced with a shrine built in front of the church. The need for a diocese was raised up after the Japanese occupation. After much discussion, finally on 25 February 1955, the Penang Diocese was established together with the Archdiocese of Kuala Lumpur. At the same time, Bishop Francis Chan and Bishop Dominic Vendargon were appointed as bishops of Penang and Kuala Lumpur, respectively. This church, together with St. John's Cathedral in Kuala Lumpur, was given the cathedral status. At that period of time, Cathedral of the Assumption served as the main church of the northern region of Malaysia. A lot of diocesan activities were held there. It was in the mid-1970s, when the cathedral and three other churches in George Town suffered a major setback. The Catholic population there started to dwindle until only about 1,500 Catholics were left in the city. Since the number of the priests were shrinking, in 1988 Bishop Antony Selvanayagam decided to merge the four parishes into one parish, named City Parish. In the 1990s, main functions of the diocese were moved to other churches. That was also the time when the Bishop of Penang had a meeting with the priests to discuss about moving the cathedral to some other places. In 2001, Bishop Antony Selvanayagam announced that in January 2003, the status of the cathedral will be moved to the Cathedral of The Holy Spirit in Green Lane, Penang. This parish emerged as the new cathedral because it has a high number of parishioners and was also a very active parish in the diocese. On 20 January 2003, the cathedral status and bishop's seat were officially moved to the new Cathedral of The Holy Spirit, thus lowering the status of the cathedral to Church of The Assumption. In 2008, when George Town and Malacca Town became UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the church was named as world heritage church. The church building was over 160 years old and has historical significance. In 2011, the church marked a year-long celebration of its 225th anniversary and also fund-raising for the restoration of the pipe organ and church building. Also at the same time, the Assumption Formation Centre was opened to cater for visitors and also spiritual formations and church activities. In 2013, the church successfully restored its organ after receiving generous donations. A concert was held in June 2014, and various choirs were invited to sing and celebrate the restoration of \\"The Old Lady\\" organ. In August 2016, the church was closed for 16 months to undergo a RM 2.5 million restoration project which included landscaping, repainting of the building, reconstruction of the sanctuary and installation of air conditioning units. The church was brought back to her former glory of 1928. The Church of the Assumption was rededicated on New Year's Day in January 2018. The Penang Roman Catholic Diocese Museum was also opened within the same grounds which features the history of the Catholic Church in Penang Island. Current status The Church of the Assumption has been under the City Parish since 1988. Today the Parish Priest is Msgr Aloysius Tan, and he is assisted by Fr Francis Anthony. It is a World Heritage Church and the oldest church in Penang. It also has a 1914 Morton & Moody pipe organ and is one of seven pipe organs still in use in Malaysia today.

Early life Bryn was born in Trondheim, Norway, the son of physician Thomas Bryn (1813‚Äì1902) and Kristine Emilie Karoline Richter (1826‚Äì1869). He was a grandson of Thomas Bryn, Sr., and a brother of Knud √òrn Bryn and Alfred J√∏rgen Bryn. In November 1892, he married Wilhelmine \\"Willa\\" Thane (1873‚Äì1929). He was also an uncle of Alf Bonnevie Bryn and Finn Bryn. Bryn took his examen artium in 1882 and graduated cand.med. from the University of Oslo in 1889. Military career Bryn first practiced as a physician in Dakota and New York between 1890 and 1891, before working as a chief resident at the hospital in Trondheim from 1891 to 1892, and then starting his own medical practice. However, he was conscripted as an army doctor, at first with the rank of lieutenant. He served at first as a military doctor in Trondheim, from 1894 holding the rank of captain. He was head of the Decorative Line Company from 1901 to 1904 and of the land conservation partnership from 1904 to 1907. In 1911, he was appointed brigade major and from 1916 was medical physician to the 5th Brigade, remaining in this position until 1924, when he was discharged from the military. As an army doctor, Bryn had good opportunities to study men from different parts of the country. His work with military recruits inspired him to do research on physical anthropology. Recognizing his interest, Colonel Hans Daae made it possible for him to conduct studies in the field, sometimes almost on a full-time basis. In 1914, he published his first anthropological work, Anthropological surveys I, and in 1917, he won the King Haakon VII gold medal for another work. That same year he received a scholarship from the Nansen Fund for conducting anthropological studies in Norway. Anthropological career After Bryn left the military, he concentrated on anthropological research. Despite his relatively advanced age, he was extremely productive and provided a number of interesting contributions to the country's anthropology, at a time when industrialization and restructuring of society had not yet managed to put their mark on the population. Already in 1921, he had presented two remarkable works, Selbu and Tydal and also published the controversial article En nordisk Cro-Magnon type, which claimed that people in Tydal were descendants of the Cro-Magnon. He released volume one of the uncompleted work Anthropologia Norwegica in 1925, and Die Somatologie der Norweger together with Kristian Schreiner in 1929. In 1932, he published Norwegische Samen, being one of the first to take an interest in the physical anthropology of the Sami people.Halfdan Bryn, 'Norwegische Lapp, Eine anthropologische Study', in Mitteilungen der anthropologischen Gesellschaft in Wien, 52 (1932) Despite not holding a doctoral degree, Bryn was a fellow of the learned societies Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters from 1892, and of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1923. He was also a member of Trondhjem city council from 1898 to 1914 and, in 1919, he was invited to join the Norwegian Society for Heredity Research.Kyllingstad, Jon R√∏yne. Kortskaller og langskaller. Scandinavian Academic Press, 2004, p. 161. From 1921 to 1922, he chaired the Norwegian Medical Association. From 1926 to 1933, he served as praeses of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters, during which time he received an honorary degree from Uppsala University in 1927. Bryn initially experienced great success and influence through his earlier works; for instance in 1920 he was referred to as \\"Norway's most famous anthropologist\\"Kyllingstad, Jon R√∏yne. Kortskaller og langskaller. Scandinavian Academic Press, 2004, p. 93. by Kristian Emil Schreiner. At this time Bryn was considered a well-established and fairly uncontroversial member of Norwegian academia. Norway's leading academic contemporaries on issues of genetics and heredity such as Kristinne Bonnevie, Otto Lous Mohr Kristian & Alette Schreiner belonged to his academic circle. Toward the later years of his life the same prominent members of that society would develop a more critical attitude towards his research methods; he would become a controversial figure among anthropologists. This was due to Bryn's contributions to scientific racism; his tendency to promote unorthodox, speculative, anthropological theories from scant and inconclusive evidence. He was a close colleague of the notorious racial theorist Hans F. K. G√ºnther, and collaborated with Herman Lundborg at the Swedish State Institute for Racial Biology, Statens institut f√∂r rasbiologi. His views on race were typical of nordicist Nordic race ideas during the interwar period. He viewed populations from Northern and Coastal Norway as bastardized populations of Nordic; dolichocephalic and brachycephalic; Lappish and Alpine stock. Bryn also referred to the populations of Trondheim and M√∏re as \\"inordinately well mixed bastard populations\\". One of Halfdan Bryn's correspondents for a short period in the early 1920s, who would eventually become a colleague, was Norway's leading eugenicist and racial hygienicist, Jon Alfred Mj√∏en. Contemporary academics such as Kristine Bonnevie and the Schreiners, viewed Mj√∏en as a dilettante. As Mj√∏en's controversial theories, and related activism, caused him to become ever more alienated from Norwegian academia, Bryn - whose his research was relevant to Mj√∏en's theories - was sometimes called upon to correct Mj√∏en by his colleagues.Kyllingstad, Jon R√∏yne. Kortskaller og langskaller. Scandinavian Academic Press, 2004, p. 164. Bryn however, proved disinclined to do this, as he seemed to agree with much of Mj√∏en's work, and eventually allied himself with Mj√∏en to the exclusion of his former colleagues. He joined the IFEO International Federation of Eugenics Organizations under Mj√∏en's behest, but did not take an active interest in the organization. He died in March 1933, in Trondheim (the new city name from 1931).

G√§ssl√∂sa is a nature reserve in Varberg Municipality, Sweden. It's situated close to Rolfstorp. The reserve has an area of 34.5 hectares. It was established in 1977.  Description  G√§ssl√∂sa consists of beech forest. Inside the reserve, there is a hill called B√∂stesberget. On the hill, there is also oak. In clear weather, the Kattegat is visible from the top of the hill. A small stream, Sten√•n, runs through the reserve in a ravine. In the spring, species such as European wood anemone, common wood sorrel and false lily of the valley are blooming. In the summer, when the canopy blocks out a lot of the sunlight, the ground is covered of less light-demanding species, such as various ferns. In addition, there are many different species of lichens in the nature reserve. The wildlife in the nature reserve is rich. Elk and deer sometimes seek out to the stream to drink the water. There are also smaller mammals, such as badger, mink and stoat. Also hazel dormouse has been observed. The population of red fox has become smaller because of scabies. Various species of birds live in the nature reserve, such as European pied flycatcher, Eurasian nuthatch, great tit, marsh tit, blue tit, green woodpecker, black woodpecker and great spotted woodpecker. In the river, there are brown trout. There are also insects like ground beetles and Geotrupes stercorarius.  Mills  Ruins of the 1844 watermill. Throughout history, several watermills have existed at the stream. In 1844, some smaller mills were replaced by one larger mill. There are still ruins of this mill in the nature reserve. It was used to extract linseed oil, but also to grind grain. After two years, the mill was taken out of service because of the low pressure on the water. It was replaced by a new watermill at Hovg√•rd in the western part of the current nature reserve. By damming up the stream and lead the water through a canal and a wooden tube, a drop height of 31.9 meters, one of the highest in southern Sweden, was created. The mill was used until the 1990s. Because of the dam at Hovg√•rd, salmon and brown trout were prevented from reproducing in the stream. The dam was demolished in 2006 and the old riverbed was restored. In the fall it was clear that the salmon had reproduced again at the original areas, which was is not possible for hundreds of years because of the dams.

In April 1958 Citro√´n, responding to the high tariff barriers that protected Spain's domestic auto-makers, established the Vigo car plantVigo Vigo, PSA Peugeot Citro√´n, 27 may 2010. in Galicia.PSA renforce son avance dans les utilitaires, L'Argus, 31 janvier 2008, page 55 the Vigo car plant is one of the largest employers in the region, with 9,700 on the payroll in 2007. It's the company's largest plant outside France with mostly outsourced employees. Beginnings Citro√´n 2CV minivan Citro√´n GS Citro√´n C15. This was the first Vigo produced Citro√´n to break through the 1,000,000 barrier, although most of the cars produced avoided the attention of Dutch graffiti artists. The plant's origins go back to the establishment at Vigo in April 1958 of \\"Citro√´n Hispania\\", employing, during that first year, approximately 100 people. The choice of Vigo arose from the presence of the port and from the tax advantages arising from the existence of a government created \\"freeport\\" zone. The first vehicle produced was the Furgoneta AZU, a locally assembled small 2CV van, which would be joined at the plant a year later by the passenger car version of the same vehicle. During the first year 400 were produced. In August 1959 saw a move to the nearby district of Bala√≠dos. The factory's second year was a time of steady expansion, and production rose to 1,700 vehicles, reflecting the increasing pace of apparently economic growth in Spain. Production was focused on the domestic market due to poverty and because of the high mutual tariffs characteristic of Spain's economic relations with its neighbours. By 1960 production was up to 3,600 vehicles and there were more than 500 employees. A decade after the creation of \\"Citro√´n Hispania\\", the factory site had virtually reached its current size. Life became more difficult in the later 1960s and 1970s. The pace of economic growth became less frenetic and other automakers established a presence in Spain including Ford, who arrived with deep pockets and negotiated a deal with the government which from the beginning permitted (and, if their project were to succeed financially, required) capital intensive high volume low cost production methods for their Fiesta model. Vigo continued to produce only the 2CV and its derivatives, small cars and vans, until 1971 when the mid-size (and by Spanish passenger car standards of the 1960s, \\"large\\") Citro√´n GS was added to the range. Nevertheless, the ongoing focus on inexpensive economy diesel cars and vans reduced the vulnerability of the business to slumps in demand for larger cars that would follow when the economy faltered during the 1970s. The Oil Price shock of 1973 hit the automobile industry particularly hard, and in the case of Spain was followed in 1975 by the death of Francisco Franco, and a period of threatening socio-economic disruption and unrest as the ensuing r√©gime change unfolded. Citroen's Vigo business nevertheless maintained unspectacular but steady growth, with a record output of more than 110,000 vehicles in 1975, by which time the plant was employing more than 6,000 people. After Peugeot bought Citro√´n, the Peugeot 504 began production in Vigo in 1977. Later the Peugeot 505 was built at the plant. However, the bulk of production were Citro√´n cars such as the Citro√´n Visa, Citro√´n BX, Citro√´n AX, Citro√´n ZX, Citro√´n Xsara, Citro√´n Xsara Picasso and Citro√´n C4 Picasso. Also, over 1.1 million units of the Citro√´n C15 van were produced from 1984 to 2005. In 1996, the Citro√´n Berlingo and Peugeot Partner began production. On 15 July 2008 the plant celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in the presence of Thierry Peugeot and Juan Carlos I of Spain. The site The site includes factory units covering panel stamping, welding, painting and assembly. Production Models produced include the Grand C4 Picasso since 2006, and C4 Picasso since 2007, Xsara Picasso and Citro√´n Berlingo/Peugeot Partner and Opel Combo. In 2012, the Peugeot 301 and Citro√´n C-Elys√©e low cost models both began production at the Vigo Plant. In 2005 Vigo produced 422,950 vehicles as well as 46,410 CKD kits. By 2007, supported by the success of the second generation Citro√´n Xsara Picasso,Christian Streiff conforte l'avenir de son site espagnol de Vigo, Bertrand Gay, Les Echos, 18 janvier 2008. the plant reported an output of 547,000, grouped into three production teams.Dossier de presse PSA Berlingo et Partner II, page 10.

Newly built ' usually only have a basic equipment (Alsdorf-Busch). ' as terminal station (Mecklenburg Spa Railway). A railway stop is a spot along a railway line, usually between stations or at a seldom-used station, where passengers can board and exit the train. While a junction or interlocking usually divides two or more lines or routes, and thus has remotely or locally operated signals, a station stop does not. A station stop usually does not have any tracks other than the main tracks, and may or may not have switches (points, crossovers).  Germany  In Germany, a ' (abbreviation: ') is a railway facility at which passengers can board or leave trains, i.e. an access point for travellers. In contrast to a railway station, a ' does not necessarily have railroad switches. There are exceptions, however, if it is locally connected to another service point. The important operational difference is that at a Haltepunkt only boarding and disembarking takes place (the train thus only stops), but at railway stations can be shunted or other trains can be awaited. The exact definition depends on national legal and operational provisions, which is why ' are usually classified as less important access points, which are often - but not necessarily - poorly accessible to passengers. Definition according to EBO The Eisenbahn-Bau- und Betriebsordnung (EBO) defines ' as a railway installation without points where trains may stop, begin or end as scheduled ( 4 8) and ' as a branch or connecting point which are locally connected to a stopping point ( 4 9). Comparable railway installations in Austria, Switzerland and South Tyrol are generally referred as '. Operational facilities A ' offers only one possibility to get on and off the trains. In contrast to a railway station, these can only stop there and in some cases also turn, but cannot overtake or cross each other. A ' consists of one or more platforms, which are arranged at the individual tracks of the open line with entrances and exits. In some areas, it can also be merely an unpaved access possibility instead of a platform. Many of today's ' used to be stations with overtaking and stabling tracks, which were then abandoned or dismantled. Typical examples are the former Hamburg Dammtor station or Gevelsberg Hauptbahnhof, both of which are only stops from an operational point of view. Some stations - for example M√ºlheim (Ruhr) Hauptbahnhof - differ from a ' only by a single pair of points. The stopping points now also include many end points of branch lines where the only track ends without a turnout connection and can only be turned, e.g. ' and '. There are usually no signals set up at a breakpoint. If the stopping point is not easily visible due to local conditions, a stopping point board () is set up at a braking distance distance. However, if a platform is located between a pre-signal and a main signal ‚Äí usually a block signal ‚Äí the pre-signal at the end of the platform is repeated with a pre-signal repeater. In the case of a stop, the signals belonging to the branch can be positioned in the area of the stop. Demand stop A special form of stopping point is the demand stop (). Trains only stop at these points when passengers actually want to board or alight. There are stop request buttons in the train which can be activated in good time by passengers who want to get off at the demand stop. Some demand stop points have a switch on the platform with which passengers who want to board can signal the approaching train that they need to do so at an early stage. This is the case, for example, at some new stops of the . On many lines, however, there are no special technical signalling devices on the platform. There it is necessary for passengers to be aware of the approaching train so that it stops. When even the smallest stations were still staffed, passengers who wanted to board a train had to report to the station supervisor and passengers who were getting off had to inform the conductor or train driver of their wish at least one station in advance.

The Ginzburg criterion tells quantitatively when mean field theory is valid. It also gives the idea of an upper critical dimension, a dimensionality of the system above which mean field theory gives proper results, and the critical exponents predicted by mean field theory match exactly with those obtained by numerical methods. Example: Ising model If \\\\phi is the order parameter of the system, then mean field theory requires that the fluctuations in the order parameter are much smaller than the actual value of the order parameter near the critical point. Quantitatively, this means that : \\\\displaystyle\\\\mathcal \\\\langle(\\\\delta \\\\phi)^2\\\\rangle \\\\quad{ \\\\ll }\\\\quad \\\\langle\\\\phi\\\\rangle^2 Using this in the Landau theory, which is identical to the mean field theory for the Ising model, the value of the upper critical dimension comes out to be 4. If the dimension of the space is greater than 4, the mean-field results are good and self-consistent. But for dimensions less than 4, the predictions are less accurate. For instance, in one dimension, the mean field approximation predicts a phase transition at finite temperatures for the Ising model, whereas the exact analytic solution in one dimension has none (except for T=0 and T\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty). Example: Classical Heisenberg model In the classical Heisenberg model of magnetism, the order parameter has a higher symmetry, and it has violent directional fluctuations which are more important than the size fluctuations. They overtake to the Ginzburg temperature interval over which fluctuations modify the mean-field description thus replacing the criterion by another, more relevant one.

He deplored the rise of socialism in the 1880s and after a serious illness he abandoned politics for local concerns. These included bowling greens for workers, tree planting and free libraries and parks for the people. Due to worsening health, he spent winters in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, where he died and was buried. A marble bust of Adams was unveiled by Thomas Burt MP on the first anniversary of his death.

They usually have a home signal in each direction and on each running line. They are mainly found where the distance between two railway stations is greater than average. In the early years of the railway, block posts were local signal boxes manned with block post keepers. Today there are only a few of these classic, railway staff-operated block posts. Their function has been largely superseded by equipment that forms part of an automatic block signalling (Selbstt√§tigen Streckenblocks or Sbk) system or by a central block post in a station signal box at one end of the section between two stations.

They were built for passenger and mail-carrying work in the US in the late 1920s. Design and development The Hamilton Metalplane Company, which merged with Boeing in 1926, built some of the earliest all-metal US aircraft. The H-45 and the H-47, which differed chiefly in having a more powerful engine, were part of that series. Both types were corrugated-aluminium-skinned in the Junkers style. The high wings were semi-cantilevers, unsupported apart from pairs of parallel struts from the fuselage bottom edge to the wing close to the fuselage. The main legs of the fixed, tailwheel undercarriage were attached at the same wing points as the struts and joined laterally by inverted V bracing. The fuselage was flat-sided, with wide windows to the passenger cabin under the wing. This was accessed via a portside door, aft of which was a smaller door into a baggage compartment. The two crew members sat in a cabin in front of the wings, accessed by a rooftop hatch. The tail was conventional, with a braced tailplane. Both the H-45 and the H-47 were powered by a single, uncowled, Pratt & Whitney 9-cylinder radial: the H-45 had a 450 hp (335 kW) Wasp and the H-47 a 525 hp (390 kW) Hornet. The Hornet gave a 10 mph (16 km/h) increase in cruising speed and a slight (3%) increase in useful load to 2300 lb (1043 kg). Both types first flew in 1928. Both could be mounted on floats. In all, about 25 H-45s and 21 H-47s were built. Operational history The H-45 and H-47 were used from 1928 to operate passenger and mail services within the US. Northwest Airways flew at least nine aircraft, introducing them on their Chicago-Minneapolis/St Paul route CAM 9 from September 1928.Davies, 1998, p.127 Other U.S. airlines to use the type for both passengers and cargo were Coastal Air Freight and Condor Air Lines.Davies, 1998, p.126. Wien Airways of Alaskaused at least one H-45 on a route from Fairbanks to the western coast and on to Point Barrow. During 1930, Isthmian Airways used Hamilton floatplanes for their service linking the Atlantic to the Pacific between respectively Crist√≥bal, Col√≥n and Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone. The airline impudently claimed the 30-minute flight as the \\"fastest transcontinental service in North America\\".Davies, 1998, p. 151 One H-47 (originally built as an H-45) was impressed by the United States Army as a UC-89 in 1942. It was found unsuitable for Army work and was struck off charge in August 1943. It was a featured aircraft in Howard Hawk's 1939 \\"Only Angels Have Wings\\" flying mail for \\"Barranca\\". The flying scenes were fake; however, the aircraft was used in ground scenes. The movie prop model (or one of them) survives. Variants H-45 Wasp powered, ~25 built. H-47 Hornet powered, 20 built. H-47 Special 525 hp (390 kW) Wright Cyclone powered, span extended to 60 ft 5 in (18.4 m). One built. UC-89 Single impressed aircraft. Surviving aircraft One H-47 remains flyable.

It monitors a system that divides athletically-competing high schools in Indiana based on the school's enrollment. The divisions, known as classes, are intended to foster fair competition among schools of similar sizes. A school ranked 3A is larger than a school ranked 1A, but not as large as a 6A-ranked school. Only football has 6 classes. Boys' basketball, girls' basketball, volleyball, baseball and softball are divided into four classes. Boys' and girls' soccer have featured three classes since the 2017‚Äì18 school year. All other sports compete in a single class. Structure See also: Indiana High School Athletic Conferences Page 1, 2, 3, or IHSAA Conference- Independent Schools The IHSAA is divided into three board of director districts: Northern, Central, and Southern. For the State Tournament, there are two divisions. The Northern District is composed of 21 of Indiana's Counties consisting the northern third of Indiana. The Southern District is composed of the remaining 71 counties and includes all of the Indianapolis area except Boone, Hamilton, and Madison Counties. It is from these two districts, the top two teams meet at the state finals usually held in or around Indianapolis. In the regular season, most of the member-schools' sports activities are governed by one, sometimes two or even three of Indiana's 51 athletic conferences. Some conferences only offer one sport while the school participates in a primary conference for all other sports. Other schools maintain independence in certain sports, like football or basketball. Some smaller sports are governed by other organizations in Indiana. For example, boys' ice hockey is under the auspices of the Indiana State High School Hockey Association (ISHSHA). High school hockey in Indiana is concentrated in the northern portion of the state, around Indianapolis, plus a few other areas, such as Columbus and Evansville.

It has been split since the nineteenth century into East and West Divisions (an Roinn Thoir/Thiar).Carbery East (W.D.) Legal context Baronies were created after the Norman invasion of Ireland as divisions of counties and were used the administration of justice and the raising of revenue. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they have been administratively obsolete since 1898. However, they continue to be used in land registration and in specification, such as in planning permissions. In many cases, a barony corresponds to an earlier Gaelic t√∫ath which had submitted to the Crown.  History  Originally Carbery East formed a single Barony of Carbery with Carbery West. This was essentially a small, semi-independent kingdom, ruled over by the MacCarthy Reagh dynasty from the 13th through 16th centuries, that broke away from the larger Kingdom of Desmond. Patrick Weston Joyce said the name Carbery comes from U√≠ Chairpre √Åebda, of which a sept, the O'Donovans under Cathal Ua Donnub√°in, migrated to the area c.1300 after being driven from County Limerick by the Fitzgeralds. Canon John O'Mahony disagreed, and offered three alternatives: Cairpre founder of D√°l Riata; or Cairbre of Uibh Laoghaire; or the Ui Carbre of Corcu Lo√≠gde, from whom Rosscarbery in the barony is named. However, supporting the first theory is that the O'Donovans, such as Crom Ua Donnab√°in, are closely associated with earliest MacCarthys in the area, and soon became their chief vassals, holding approximately right in the middle of the medieval barony.Butler, W.F.T., \\"The Barony of Carbery\\", in Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society, Volume X, Second Series. 1904. pp. 1‚Äì10, 73‚Äì84  Location and settlements  Carbery East is bordered by the baronies of Carbery West to the west, Bantry to the northwest, Muskerry West to the north, Kinalmeaky to the northeast, and Kinsale and Courceys to the east.

Manure is organic matter that is used as organic fertilizer in agriculture. Most manure consists of animal feces; other sources include compost and green manure. Manures contribute to the fertility of soil by adding organic matter and nutrients, such as nitrogen, that are utilised by bacteria, fungi and other organisms in the soil. Higher organisms then feed on the fungi and bacteria in a chain of life that comprises the soil food web. History According to a Byzantine tradition attributed to Cassianus Bassus pig dung was generally not usable as fertilizer, except for almond trees. Similar views recorded by Columella were unrelated to the Islamic taboos of later centuries, though the medieval Andalusian writer Ibn Bassal and some later writers from Yemen also recorded negative effects of pig dung \\"burning\\" plants. Ibn Bassal described a sort of mixed manure with straw or sweeping mixed in as mudaf, implying that was not composed of only manure. The sweepings from hot baths included urine and human wastes, which Ibn Bassal describes as dry and salty, unsuitable for use as fertilizer unless mixed with manure. Ibn Bassal gives two recipes for composting pigeon (hamam) and possibly donkey (himar) manure, though the translation is uncertain. Bassal says the excessive heat and moist qualities of pigeon dung worked well for weaker and less hardy plants, especially those effected by cold temperatures.Manure Matters: Historical, Archaeological and Ethnographic Perspectives Types Skatole is the source of the foul smelling odor of manure. There are in the 21st century three main classes of manures used in soil management: Animal manure Concrete reservoirs, one new, and one containing cow manure mixed with water. This is common in rural Hainan Province, China. Most animal manure consists of feces. Common forms of animal manure include farmyard manure (FYM) or farm slurry (liquid manure). FYM also contains plant material (often straw), which has been used as bedding for animals and has absorbed the feces and urine. Agricultural manure in liquid form, known as slurry, is produced by more intensive livestock rearing systems where concrete or slats are used, instead of straw bedding. Manure from different animals has different qualities and requires different application rates when used as fertilizer. For example horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, chickens, turkeys, rabbits, and guano from seabirds and bats all have different properties. For instance, sheep manure is high in nitrogen and potash, while pig manure is relatively low in both. Horses mainly eat grass and a few weeds so horse manure can contain grass and weed seeds, as horses do not digest seeds the way that cattle do. Cattle manure is a good source of nitrogen as well as organic carbon.Chicken litter, coming from a bird, is very concentrated in nitrogen and phosphate and is prized for both properties. Animal manures may be adulterated or contaminated with other animal products, such as wool (shoddy and other hair), feathers, blood, and bone. Livestock feed can be mixed with the manure due to spillage. For example, chickens are often fed meat and bone meal, an animal product, which can end up becoming mixed with chicken litter. Compost Compost containing turkey manure and wood chips from bedding material is dried and then applied to pastures for fertilizer. Compost is the decomposed remnants of organic materials. It is usually of plant origin, but often includes some animal dung or bedding. Green manure Green manures are crops grown for the express purpose of plowing them in, thus increasing fertility through the incorporation of nutrients and organic matter into the soil. Leguminous plants such as clover are often used for this, as they fix nitrogen using Rhizobia bacteria in specialized nodes in the root structure. Other types of plant matter used as manure include the contents of the rumens of slaughtered ruminants, spent grain (left over from brewing beer) and seaweed. Uses of manure=Animal manure Manure on a wall. Odor is an obvious and major issue with manure. Components in swine manure include low molecular weight carboxylic acids, acetic, propionic, butyric, and valeric acids. Other components include skatole and trimethyl amine. Animal manure, such as chicken manure and cow dung, has been used for centuries as a fertilizer for farming. It can improve the soil structure (aggregation) so that the soil holds more nutrients and water, and therefore becomes more fertile. Animal manure also encourages soil microbial activity which promotes the soil's trace mineral supply, improving plant nutrition. It also contains some nitrogen and other nutrients that assist the growth of plants. Manures with a particularly unpleasant odor (such as slurries from intensive pig farming) are usually knifed (injected) directly into the soil to reduce release of the odor. Manure from pigs and cattle is usually spread on fields using a manure spreader. Due to the relatively lower level of proteins in vegetable matter, herbivore manure has a milder smell than the dung of carnivores or omnivores. However, herbivore slurry that has undergone anaerobic fermentation may develop more unpleasant odors, and this can be a problem in some agricultural regions. Poultry droppings are harmful to plants when fresh, but after a period of composting are valuable fertilizers. Manure is also commercially composted and bagged and sold as a soil amendment.https://wimastergardener.org/article/using-manure-in-the-home- garden/ In 2018, Austrian scientists offered a method of paper production from elephant and cow manure. Issues The women of a neighborhood ward with manure on their way to the field of one of them, Tireli, Mali 1990 Any quantity of manure may be a source of pathogens or food spoilage organisms which may be carried by flies, rodents or a range of other vector organisms and cause disease or put food safety at risk. Livestock antibiotics In 2007, a University of Minnesota study indicated that foods such as corn, lettuce, and potatoes have been found to accumulate antibiotics from soils spread with animal manure that contains these drugs. Organic foods may be much more or much less likely to contain antibiotics, depending on their sources and treatment of manure. For instance, by Soil Association Standard 4.7.38, most organic arable farmers either have their own supply of manure (which would, therefore, not normally contain drug residues) or else rely on green manure crops for the extra fertility (if any nonorganic manure is used by organic farmers, then it usually has to be rotted or composted to degrade any residues of drugs and eliminate any pathogenic bacteria‚ÄîStandard 4.7.38, Soil Association organic farming standards). On the other hand, as found in the University of Minnesota study, the non-usage of artificial fertilizers, and resulting exclusive use of manure as fertilizer, by organic farmers can result in significantly greater accumulations of antibiotics in organic foods.

History A Techichi, likely the ancestor of Chihuahuas. National Museum of Anthropology. The Chihuahua's history is convoluted, and many theories surround the origin of the breed. Both folklore and archaeological finds show that the breed has origins in Mexico. The most common theory is that Chihuahua is descended from the Techichi, a companion dog favored by the Toltec civilization in Mexico. No records of the Techichi are available before the 9th century, although dog pots from Colima, Mexico, buried as part of the western Mexico shaft tomb tradition, which date back to 300 BC, are thought to depict Techichis. The earlier ancestors probably had been present before the Mayas, as dogs approximating the Chihuahua are found in materials from the Great Pyramid of Cholula, antedating 1530 and in the ruins of Chichen Itza on the Yucat√°n Peninsula. However, a genetic study indicated that there was less than 2 percent pre-European mitochondrial DNA in modern Chihuahuas due to admixture with the European dogs. In a 1520 letter, Hernan Cort√©s wrote that the Aztecs raised and sold little dogs as food. Colonial records refer to small, nearly hairless dogs at the beginning of the 19th century, one of which claims 16th-century Conquistadores found them plentiful in the region later known as Chihuahua.Pedro Baptista Pino y Juan Lopez Cancelada, Exposici√≥n sucinta y sencilla de la Provincia del Nuevo M√©xico y otros escritos. Ed. Jesus Paniagua Perez. Valladolid: Junta de Castilla / Le√≥n: Universidad de Le√≥n, 2007, p. 244: \\"even in the desert the tiny dogs could be found, hunting rats, mice, and lizards. \\" The footnote that follows alludes to starving Conquistadores reportedly hunting and stewing the dogs (Universidad Veracruzana, Arquivo Viejo, XXVI.2711). Small dogs such as Chihuahuas were also used as living heating pads during illness or injury. Some believe this practice is where the idea of pain being transferred to animals from humans originated, which gave way to rituals such as burning the deceased with live dogs, such as the Techichi, to exonerate the deceased human's sins.Coile, C. (2000). The Chihuahua Handbook. Hauppauge, NY: Barron‚Äôs Educational Series, p. 3: \\"Small dogs have been used as living hot-water bottles throughout the world for centuries. Placing a warm dog onto an aching body part can be soothing, and it may be where the idea arose that the pain was being transferred from the person to the dog.\\" Chihuahuas as we know them today remained a rarity until the early 20th century; the American Kennel Club (AKC) did not register a Chihuahua until 1904.Coile, C. (2013). Chihuahuas: Everything about purchase, care, nutrition, behavior, and training. Hauppauge, NY: Barron‚Äôs Educational Series, p. 7: \\"Only in 1904 did the American Kennel Club (AKC) register its first Chihuahua; a total of five were registered that year.‚Äù Appearance  Chihuahuas are the smallest breed recognised by some kennel clubs. There are two varieties of Chihuahua recognised by the AKC and the UK Kennel Club ‚Äì the Smooth Coat (smooth-haired) and the Long Coat (long- haired). The UK Kennel Club considers the two to be distinct breeds; mating between the two are not eligible for KC registration. The AKC considers Long and Smooth coated chihuahuas to be the same breed. Typically, the breed standard for both the Long and Smooth coat Chihuahuas will be identical except for the description of the coat. Both the Smooth and the Long Coats have their special attractions and are equally easy to keep clean and well-groomed. The term smooth coat does not mean that the hair is necessarily smooth, as the hair can range from having a velvet touch to a whiskery feel. Longhaired Chihuahuas are actually smoother to the touch, having soft, fine guard hairs and a downy undercoat, which gives them their fluffy appearance. Unlike many longhaired breeds, longhaired Chihuahuas require no trimming and minimal grooming. Contrary to popular belief, the longhaired breed also typically sheds less than its shorthaired counterparts. Up to three or more years may be needed before a full longhaired coat develops. Current breed standards defined by registries such as the AKC specify an \\"apple-head\\" or \\"apple-dome\\" skull conformation. Chihuahuas have large, round eyes and large, erect ears, set in a high, dramatically rounded skull. The stop is well defined, forming a near 90 degree angle where the muzzle meets the skull. Breed standards for this dog do not generally specify a height; only a weight and a description of their overall proportions. Generally, the height ranges between ; however, some dogs grow as tall as . Both British and American breed standards state that a Chihuahua must not weigh more than for conformation. However, the British standard also states that a weight of is preferred. A clause stating. \\"if two dogs are equally good in type, the more diminutive one is preferred\\" was removed in 2009. The F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale standard calls for dogs ideally between 1.5 and 3.0 kg (3.3 and 6.6 lb), although smaller ones are acceptable in the show ring. Pet Chihuahuas (that is, those bred or purchased as companions rather than show dogs) often range above these weights, even above 10 lb if they have large bone structures or are allowed to become overweight. This does not mean that they are not purebred Chihuahuas; they just do not meet the requirements to enter a conformation show. Oversized Chihuahuas are seen in some of the best, and worst, bloodlines. Chihuahuas do not breed true for size, and puppies from the same litter can mature in drastically different sizes from one another. Also, larger breeding females are less likely to experience dystocia (obstructed labour). Many breeders try to breed Chihuahuas as small as possible, because those marketed as \\"teacup\\" or \\"tiny teacup\\" command higher prices. Chihuahuas occur in virtually any color combination, from solid to marked or splashed,American Kennel Club Chihuahua page, retrieved on July 29, 2007. allowing for colors from solid black to solid white, spotted, sabled, or a variety of other colors and patterns. Colors and patterns can combine and affect each other, resulting in a very high degree of variation. Common colors are fawn, red, cream, chocolate, brown, mixed, white, and black. No color or pattern is considered more valuable than another. The merle coat pattern, which appears mottled, is not traditionally considered part of the breed standard. In May 2007, The Kennel Club decided not to register puppies with this coloration due to the health risks associated with the responsible gene, and in December of that year, formally amended its breed standard to disqualify merle dogs. The F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale, which represents the major kennel clubs of 84 countries, also disqualified merle. Other countries' kennel clubs, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Germany, have also disqualified merle. However, in May 2008, the Chihuahua Club of America voted that merles would not be disqualified in the United States, and would be fully registrable and able to compete in AKC events. Opponents of merle recognition suspect the coloration came about by modern crossbreeding with other dogs and not by natural genetic drift.  Apple head vs. Deer head Chihuahuas  Dogs of any coat type may be identified as either \\"apple head\\" or \\"deer head\\" Chihuahuas. Apple heads have rounded heads, close-set eyes, and relatively short ears and legs. Deer heads have flat-topped heads, more widely set eyes, larger ears, and longer, more slender legs. Deer heads were the breed standard conformation in the mid-20th century, but current breed standards defined by registries such as the AKC specify the apple-head conformation. The Apple Head Chihuahua is known for having a round/apple-shaped head and a definite \\"stop\\" whereas a Deer Head Chihuahua \\"may\\" have a flatter head, thinner skull, but is unlikely to have a \\"stop\\" and will probably have a much longer nose. Their physical body shape is largely the same, except the Deer Head Chihuahua is known to have longer legs than other Chihuahuas. The Deer Head Chihuahua tends to be larger in weight, where an Apple Head is more likely to keep their weight under ten pounds. Apple Head Chihuahuas are longer than they are tall and have shorter necks. Deer Head Chihuahuas have longer ears than Apple Heads and their head also has a slope-shaped form. Both Apple Head and Deer Head can have short hair or long hair. They also both come in various different colors such as brown, black, tan, or white. Chihuahuas can show traits from both Apple Head and Deer Head. \\"Deer Head Chihuahuas tend to have better health than Apple Heads, due to their longer noses\\". There is no scientific evidence that Apple Heads have a higher risk of getting respiratory issues, due to having a smaller airway. Deer Headed Chihuahuas are not allowed in the AKC due to not meeting the standards that Apple Heads do. Deer Head Chihuahuas are not allowed because they have a longer jaw line and a slope that connects their muzzle and head, creating a 45 degree angle instead of a 90 degree angle like the Apple Head. Apple Heads are allowed in the AKC and meet the requirements due to having a smaller weight, having a rounder head, and also having a 90 degree angle formed by the muzzle to the forehead. Temperament Chihuahua lounging on owner's lap How a Chihuahua behaves depends on the genetic temperament of their parents and grandparents. Their small size makes them delicate and vulnerable to injuries and attacks from larger animals. Like all dogs, they benefit from appropriate socialization and training. Chihuahuas tend to learn better when being rewarded positive reinforcement, such as a treat or praise. With the proper training a Chihuahua needs, this dog can be extremely intelligent. The way a dog is trained will influence its behavior. Chihuahuas are fragile and can be easily frightened, so are generally unsuitable for homes with small children. The breed tends to be fiercely loyal to one particular person and in some cases may become overprotective of the person, especially around other people or animals,The Chihuahua, Dog Owners Guide at canismajor.com. and tend to have a \\"clannish\\" nature, often preferring the companionship of other Chihuahuas or Chihuahua mixes over other dogs.About Chihuahuas, British Chihuahua Club, retrieved on July 29, 2007. These traits generally make them unsuitable for households with children who are not patient and calm. Because Chihuahuas get cold easily they tend to love their dens and will often burrow themselves in pillows, clothes hampers, and blankets. They are often found under the covers or at the bottom of the bed, deep in the dark and safety of what they perceive as their den. Chihuahuas also enjoy time in sunlight. Chihuahuas sometimes act like cats and climb up to the highest point on a couch, usually on top of the pillows, and curl up into a ball. Chihuahuas have their own type of personality. They tend to be alert. Chihuahuas typically do not show fear; even though they are a smaller breed, they do not view their size as a disadvantage. Health Chihuahua puppy This breed requires expert veterinary attention in areas such as birthing and dental care. Dental care is a must for these small dogs, whose jaw size makes for weaker teeth. Although daily brushing provides the best preventive measure, feeding a dental diet or using dental chews for dogs is an effective approach pet owners can take to help prevent and control accumulation of plaque and tartar to avoid consequences of severe periodontal disease. The best physical characteristics of dog food to contribute to cleaning a dog's teeth would be food that is large and dense, so more time is spent chewing, which leads to the surface of the teeth being cleaned. Chihuahuas, and other toy breeds, can be affected by hydrocephalus. Chihuahua puppies with hydrocephalus have an abnormally large head, are lethargic, and do not grow at the same pace as their siblings. A true case of hydrocephalus can be diagnosed by a veterinarian, though the prognosis is grim. Apple head Chihuahuas can have moleras, or a soft spot in their skulls, and they are the only breed of dog to be born with an incomplete skull. This is not a defect; it is a normal adaptation facilitating the passage through the birth canal and growth and development of the domed type of forehead. The molera is predominant in the apple heads and is present in nearly all Chihuahua puppies. The molera fills in with age, but great care needs to be taken during the first six months until the skull is fully formed. Some moleras do not close completely and require extra care to prevent injury. Chihuahua puppies can be at risk for hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Signs of hypoglycemia include lethargy, sleepiness, uncoordinated walking, unfocused eyes, spasms of the neck muscles or head pulling back or to the side, fainting, and seizures. Hypoglycemia can be avoided with adequate nutrition and frequent feedings, especially for Chihuahuas that are younger, smaller, or leaner. Chihuahua owners should have a simple-sugar supplement on hand to use in emergencies, such as Nutri-Cal or corn syrup. These supplements can be rubbed on the gums and roof of the mouth to rapidly raise the blood sugar level. However, as with any dog, owners should take care not to overfeed their Chihuahua, since obesity can result in increased rates of joint injuries, tracheal collapse, chronic bronchitis, and shortened lifespan. As in other breeds with large protruding eyes, Chihuahuas are prone to eye infections and eye injury. The eyes may water in response to dry air, dust, or airborne allergens. Collapsed trachea is a health concern characteristic of the Chihuahua breed. Chihuahuas may tremble or shiver when stressed, excited, or cold. These dogs, especially the short coat variety, are less tolerant of cold than larger breeds, and require a sweater/coat and/or boots in cold weather. They seek warmth in sunshine, under blankets, or on furniture, or human laps. Some Chihuahuas may present separation anxiety as a result of being so close and loyal to their owners. This is a fairly common cause behind any pacing, excessive salivating, destructive chewing, or barking, howling, or whining in dogs. Many treatments and tips can help prevent separation anxiety in dogs. The lifespan for a Chihuahua is usually between 12 and 20 years. Chihuahuas are also known for luxating patella, a genetic condition that can occur in all dogs. In some dogs, the ridges forming the patellar groove are not shaped correctly and a shallow groove is created, causing the patella to luxate or slip out of place, sideways. The knee cap sliding across the bony ridges of the femur can cause some pain. The affected chihuahua will hold its leg flexed, and foot off the ground until the quadriceps muscle relaxes and lengthens, after which the animal feels no discomfort and continues with activity. Chihuahuas are also prone to some heart-related disorders, such as heart murmurs and pulmonic stenosis, a condition in which the blood outflow from the heart's right ventricle is obstructed at the pulmonic valve.  Chihuahua crossbreeds  Apart from different types of Chihuahuas, breeders across the world started crossbreeding Chihuahuas with other dog breeds in order to create breeds of mixed traits. The result of crossbreeding Chihuahuas with other dog breeds such as Pomeranian dogs, Pembroke Welsh Corgis, Boston Terriers, Pugs and so on, usually ends up in a dog breed of a Chihuahua's body size and the other parent breed's coat color and fur traits. These are the most common Chihuahua crossbreeds: * Chihuahua and Yorkshire Terrier - also known as the Chorkie * Chihuahua and Pug ‚Äì also called the Chug * Chihuahua and Bichon Frise ‚Äì also called the Chi Chon * Chihuahua and Boston Terrier ‚Äì also known as the Boston Huahua * Chihuahua and Pekingese ‚Äì also known as the Cheek * Chihuahua and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel ‚Äì also known as the Chilier * Chihuahua and Jack Russell ‚Äì also called the Jack Huahua * Chihuahua and Pomeranian ‚Äì also called the Pomchi * Chihuahua and Pembroke Welsh Corgi ‚Äì also called the Chigi * Chihuahua and Poodle ‚Äì also known as Chipoo * Chihuahua and Dachshund ‚Äì also called the Chiweenie * Chihuahua and MinPin (Miniature Pinscher) ‚Äì also called the Chipin * Chihuahua and Pitbull/Terrier - also called a Chibull or Pithuahua * Chihuahua and Chinese Crested - also called a ChiChi Poodles and Bichon Frise dog breeds are often used in crossbreeding because of their hypoallergenic fur. This way, the developed crossbreed might inherit entirely or partly this allergy-friendly trait, which makes it more suitable for individuals that suffer from pet allergies.

It is one of many coal mines in Central Queensland, Australia and is located at Moranbah about 30 km north of the township. The mine produced 12.4 million tonnes of metallurgical coal from July 2012 to June 2013. It is owned by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance. The Goonyella Upper Seam, the Goonyella Middle Seam and the Goonyella Lower Seam are all mined at the site. The coal is well known for its great coking characteristics. Much of the coal was such a high grade, the wash plants were often programmed to add ash to meet the contracted export quality targets. The Goonyella Mine was developed by Central Queensland Coal Associates, (Utah International Corporation 85% and Mitsubishi Development Co 15%) before being sold to BHP.Massive Coal Trains Move Over Queensland's Heaviest Tracks Railway Transportation December 1971 page 19 Operations commenced in 1971 at Goonyella while mining began at Riverside in 1982.

Accessed 2011-10-01 The Act has been considered ineffective to the legislation's purpose, as seen in court decisions and the minimal amendments and recommendations implemented. The minimal updates to the Act are dissimilar to the significant changes that have been made to other heritage protection acts such as the Native Title Act 1993 and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.  Purpose and function  The Act was established as a 'final resort' to heritage protection where state and territory protections were unsuccessful. As Senator Ryan stated when introducing the bill, \\"Where a State or Territory has no law capable of providing effective protection, or no action is being taken to give effect to that law, the Commonwealth will act in appropriate cases.‚ÄùCommonwealth, Parliamentary Debates, House of Representatives, 6 June 1984 ( Senator Ryan). The Act defines ‚ÄòAboriginal tradition‚Äô as: ‚Äú the body of traditions, observances, customs and beliefs of Aboriginals generally or of a particular community or group of Aboriginals, and includes any such traditions, observances, customs or beliefs relating to particular persons, areas, objects or relationships.‚ÄùAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (Cth) s 3(1). The Federal Court of Australia has expanded the definition to require ‚Äúa degree of antiquity to the traditions‚ÄùChapman v Luminis Pty Ltd (No 5) [2001] FCA 1106, 398. whilst respecting intergenerational transmission may incorporate some variation. ‚ÄòAreas of significance‚Äô can be Australian land- freehold, leasehold, private, national park or crown land- across states and territories, and internal waters or territorial seas.Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (Cth) s 8. An area is considered injured or desecrated if it is used or treated in a manner inconsistent with Aboriginal traditions, including if a persons presence there would be inconsistent.Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (Cth) s 3(2). The threat of injury or desecration must be specific; a declaration cannot be made against acts already taken, or potential acts in the future. The threat of injury or desecration also, cannot compel action such as developing a management plan.Heritage Division of Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Introduction to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, (2010), p 9. Aboriginal human remains can be claimed as objects of significance however the Act has a limited definition of which Aboriginal human remains can be considered of particular significance to Aboriginal traditions.  Key Cases = The Wamba Wamba case  An emergency declaration for area protection was made in 1989 on a development site for a golf course and country club.Wamba Wamba Local Aboriginal Land Council and Murray River Regional Aboriginal Land Council v The Minister Administering the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 and Murrays Downs Golf & Country Club Limited [1989] FCA 210. Before development, in 1986, archeological evidence found the area was likely to have skeletal remains dating back 30,000 year. Development was approved in 1987 and in December 1988, human remains were found in the construction site. Those remains were reburied however more were found and left on the golf course building site.Prue Vines, \\"Resting in Peace? A Comparison of the Legal Control of Bodily Remains in Cemeteries and Aboriginal Burial Grounds Australia‚Äù 20 (1) Sydney Law Review 78, 1998. Aboriginal custodians requested reburial in the same site and the movement of the club house and bowling green to an alternative area. Justice Lockhart noted: ‚Äú[Burial sites] are the places which Aboriginals believe are the place of the spirits waiting to be called back, and, if the spirits are disturbed, the Aboriginal people believe that they will suffer because of the failure to care for them.‚Äù Despite Justice Lockhart saying ‚Äúundoubted historical significance and strength of Aboriginal tradition relating to land with which this case is concerned and land nearby raise questions of political sensitivity, high emotion and spiritual, as well as material, significance‚Äù, the application was dismissed.

The Minister did not declare the site protected as he did not believe it met the threshold of significance. Williams sued the Minister for ‚Äúfailure to take into account a relevant consideration‚Äù and ‚Äòunreasonableness. The claim of unreasonableness was unsuccessful as ‚Äúa court is not entitled to strike down an administrative decision on the ground of unreasonableness simply because the judge would have decided the issue differently\\". However, the minister was ordered to reconsider the application. Lake Cowal is not under declared protection.

The delays often resulted in the destruction and injury of areas and objects. * The legislation was deemed ineffectual as few areas, from 1984 to January 1996, had protective declarations made. Between the allotted time frame, 4 out of 49 applications for requested declarations of protection were approved.Elizabeth Evatt, Parliament of Australia, ‚ÄôReview of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984.‚Äô (Report no. 170 of 1996, July 1996). p.11.

Requiring applicants to disclose restricted information to claim significance meant Indigenous cultural obligations were disregarded.Douglas v Tickner [1994] FCA 1066. Despite criticism, the review noted existing positive outcomes of the Act. The Act had instigated state, Indigenous and developer negotiations which at times produced protections without making declarations. The Act also intervened to modify or withdraw proposals, which resulted in developers consulting with Indigenous communities to discuss their respective interests. The Evatt review was criticised for its time limitations regarding submissions and consultations. It was also criticised for not reviewing the Act in light of the Mabo decision. The Evatt report‚Äôs recommendations are summarised as follows: * It was recommended that a cohesive national policy managed by a co-ordinating body should be created to reduce duplication and complication of state and federal laws.Elizabeth Evatt, Parliament of Australia, ‚ÄôReview of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984.‚Äô (Report no. 170 of 1996, July 1996). p.42-43, 119.

The proposed changes also included a new system of accreditation for state or territory heritage protection laws . Where heritage protection laws in states and territories were deemed effective by the federal minister, the laws would become ‚Äòaccredited‚Äô.New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council, Summary of key proposed changes to the Federal Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, (online factsheet, retrieved 27 May 2020) The effect would be applications be referred back to respective states or territories to be considered by their accredited legislation, and emergency declarations to the federal minister could not be made. This would minimise federal participation and ensure federal decisions would not override state or territory laws. It is noted that the ‚Äúproposed changes [were] not designed to allow Aboriginal people to make final decisions regarding their cultural heritage. The final decision would be made by the relevant government department, agency or Minister.‚Äù The discussion paper also proposed that only ‚Äúlegally recognised traditional custodians‚ÄùDepartment of Environment and Heritage, ‚ÄòThe Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984: Guide to purposes, applications and decision-making‚Äô, August 2009.

Amendments  From 1984, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs was responsible for administering the ATSIHP Act and was ‚Äúassisted by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.‚ÄùAustralian Human Rights Commission, Native Title Report 2000: Chapter 4: Indigenous heritage (Report 2000, 23 February 2001) However, independent of legislative amendments, from December 1998, the ‚Äúresponsibility was then transferred to the Minister for the Environment who administers the Act through Environment Australia.‚Äù  The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998  In 1998 a bill of amendments was announced, as the Act had been overhauled after the Evatt Review, but failed to be introduced.Clare Culvenor. ‚ÄòCommonwealth Heritage Protection Legislation‚Äô. (2000) 5(3) Indigenous Law Bulletin 17. The bill introduced requirements for applicants to prove that protection was in the ‚Äònational interest‚Äô and that applicants had exhausted all state or territory remedies.Bills Digest Service (Cth), Bills Digest No. 47 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998 (Digest No. 47 of 1998, 1 December 1998). No Indigenous Heritage Advisory Board was instituted. This bill received mixed reviews.Commonwealth, Parliamentary Debates'', Senate, 22 November 1999 (Senator Cooney). Requiring the exhaustion of state or territory remedies, where those legislative measures were deemed unsatisfactory, was believed to ‚Äúwaste valuable time and resources‚Ä¶risking the desecration of a significant area or object‚Äù. The national interest test was considered too high a threshold for a last resort legislative measureCommonwealth of Australia, Explanatory Memorandum: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill (No.2) 1998, cl 45, p15. and ‚Äònational interest‚Äô was not defined in the bill. Consensus on the bill and various amendments between the House of Representatives and the Senate could not be made. Two commonwealth parliamentary committees - the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Indigenous Land Fund and the Senate Legal and Constitutional (Legislation) Committee - were formed to decide on the validity of the Evatt Recommendations. Both committees suggested the bill introduce Evatt recommendations however government majority maintained minimal inclusion of recommendations. Evatt recommendations were not implemented.  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Amendment Act 2006  Victorian Amendments = In 2006, amendments to the ATSIHP Act were made to remove the Victoria specific provisions.Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (Cth) sIIA. Since 1987, Victoria had state specific provisions within the Act that served as their heritage protection legislation which the Victorian government requested to repeal in 2005 as it limited the ability for the state to create Victorian specific heritage protection legislation.Commonwealth, Parliamentary Debates, Senate, 8 August 2006 (Senator Abetz) Senator Siewert was concerned that the state legislation would be insufficient, stating ‚ÄúI am concerned that handing over responsibility to Victoria effectively means that the Commonwealth is failing to meet its heritage obligations to the Indigenous peoples of Victoria.‚ÄùCommonwealth, Parliamentary Debates, Senate, 11 May 2006 (Senator Siewert)< https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2F2006-05-11%2F0091%22 This concern arose out of believed ‚Äúlack of appropriate and adequate consultation that was involved in the drafting of the Victorian legislation.‚Äù In response to this amendment, Victoria produced the ‚ÄòAboriginal Heritage Act 2006'. The effect of this amendment was the commonwealth Act having the same application across Australia. = Significant Object Amendments = After the Dja Dja Wurrung Bark Etchings Case, where 19th century bark etchings loaned to Museum Victoria from London were placed under emergency declarations under the Act,Elizabeth Willis, ‚ÄòThe Law, Politics, and ‚ÄúHistorical Wounds‚Äù: The Dja Dja Warrung Bark Etchings Case in Australia‚Äô (2008) vol 15 (1) International Journal of Cultural Property, 49-63. sections were added to the Act to stop declarations being made on objects that were under the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986,,Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (Cth) s12(3A) and s18(2A). like items owned by museums. This was added as overseas institutions, like museums, would be reluctant to loan material without the assurance of the objects returnCommonwealth, Parliamentary Debates, Senate, 12 October 2005 (Senator Patterson).< https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2F2005-10-12%2F0005%22> and this amendment would ‚Äúhelp to secure the framework for future international cultural exchanges of benefit to Australia‚Äù. This bill was passed, however concerns around the effectiveness of the Act were raised as ‚ÄúIndigenous communities would not consider the ability to view behind glass in a museum what they see as stolen items as any substitute for the loss of this heritage‚Äù. Senator Siewart also stated ‚Äúthere is increasing international activity around the return of cultural artefacts‚Ä¶more must be done to pursue the return of these precious and sacred artefacts from overseas‚Äù and this amendment would reduce repatriation efforts.  Examples of Declared Protected Areas  Todd River, which intersects with Junction Waterhole and where a dam was planned in 1990's.  Junction Waterhole (Niltye/Tnyere-Akerte), Alice Springs  A declaration spanning 20 years was placed on Junction Waterhole in 1992. The declaration was contentious due to existing flooding concerns and town water supply. The declaration halted the damming of the Todd river which would have flooded sacred sites. The area is considered sacred as it is the site of ‚Äútwo Dreaming tracks which converge and interact in this area‚Äù.Hal Wootten, ‚ÄòThe Alice Springs Dam and Sacred Sites‚Äô The Australian Quarterly 65 (4) The Politics of Mabo (Summer, 1993), p 13. These Dreaming tracks \\"traverses the continent from Port Augusta to the North Australian coast\\". This place was notable in the Act‚Äôs history as it was the first site to receive a long-term declaration.Tamzin Chapman, Corroboree Shield: A comparative Historical Analysis of (the lack of) International, National and State Level Indigenous Cultural Heritage Protection (2008) 5(1) Macquarie Journal of International and Comparative Environmental Law 81.  Boobera Lagoon, Moree, NSW.  Boobera Lagoon is protected under a permanent protection declaration as of the 1 July 2000. The area, the lagoon and the land bordering it, is of great significance to Kamilaroi people and was at risk of environmental damage by power boats and water skiing.Quiggin, Robynne ‚ÄòBoobera Lagoon‚Äô (2001) 5(6) Indigenous Law Bulletin 4. Earlier efforts to protect the site were its being catalogued by the National Parks and Wildlife Service in 1977, and two separate emergency declarations under the Act in 1992 and 1994. The declaration for protection was decided in 1998, after considering separate reports on the Lagoon.Einfield, Hon. Justice Marcus, Killen, Hon. Sir James & Mundine, Kaye, The Toomelah Report, Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sydney, June 1988.Hal Wootten AC QC Report to Minister for Aboriginal Affairs re Boobera Lagoon, April 1996. The date of commencement of the declaration was two years after deciding the site was under threat of injury or desecration as ‚Äúrelevant State and Local Government agencies to establish an alternative water-skiing site‚Äù.Hon. Senator John Herron, Statement of Reasons, January 1999. In May 2000 there was an attempt to postpone the commencement date by Senator Hill‚Äôs review which stated ‚Äúthe lagoon has been extensively used for water skiing for 50 years... Water-skiing has become a significant family based activity in an area of regional Australia where there are few such opportunitiesSenator the Honourable Robert Hill, Decision on the Future of Boobera Lagoon, (Media Release, 28 June 2000) However negative international attention regarding the lagoon meant the date of commencement remained the 1st July 2001. The decision to delay and attempted postponement has been recorded as showing ‚Äúloss for the Aboriginal community and the wider Australian community..[as] the interests of recreational users have been preferred to the human right of Indigenous people to have their culture protected‚Äù and ‚Äúlocal Aboriginal people [were] prevented from fulfilling their role as custodians of the area‚Äù due to the delays.

It is a member of the family Varanidae. Etymology The specific name, dumerilii, is in honour of French herpetologist Andr√© Marie Constant Dum√©ril.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Varanus dumerilii, p. 77).

(in German). however, it has been observed eating snails, insects, molluscs, fish, frogs, and smaller rodents. Little is known overall about this species compared to other monitor lizards. Description Adult Dumeril's monitors are largely dark coffee-brown in colour, with occasional brighter indistinct crossbars. For juveniles the colors and patterns are quite different. \\"The major color is a dark varnish black which is interrupted by several yellow crossways bars on the back.\\" Juveniles have shiny orange red or, sometimes yellow heads. This youth coloration disappears after only 4‚Äì8 weeks. Adult Dumeril's can reach up to in total length (including tail) although typical length is long.

He became well known for his genre paintings of children.Biography of Henry Lejeune Life Henry Le Jeune was born in London, the son of Anthony Le Jeune, a professional musician of Flemish origin, and the third of five children.Le Jeune's father and grandfather were professional musicians, and his brothers organists at various chapels. His sister, who was also musical, became a photographer. After showing an early interest in art he was encouraged by his family to study the art collections in the British Museum. Eft (1862) In 1834, Le Jeune was admitted to the Royal Academy where, after winning 4 silver medals in succession, he won a gold medal in 1841 for the biblical painting \\"Samson Bursting his Bonds\\" (exhibited the following year at the British Institution). He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1840 with a work entitled \\"Joseph Interpreting the Dream of Pharaoh's Chief Butler\\". From 1845-48 he taught at the Government School of design at Somerset House, and from 1848-64 was curator and instructor at the Royal Academy. He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy (ARA) in 1863 and an honorary retired associate in 1886. Family Le Jeune married Dorothy Lewis (1815‚Äì1864) on 21 June 1844 and had five sons and three daughters.Family details can be found at tollis.com. He lived in London all his life, dying in Hampstead in 1904. He was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. Work Le Jeune painted in both oils and watercolours. His works were exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1840‚Äì94, at the British Institution between 1842‚Äì63, and at other galleries. Early in his career he painted mainly biblical or literary scenes (Shakespeare or Spenser). These included such titles as \\"The infancy of Moses\\" (1842), \\"Prospero and Miranda\\" (1844), \\"Ruth and Boaz (1845), \\"The Sermon on the mount\\" (1845) and \\"The liberation of the slaves\\" (1847 - which was purchased by Prince Albert). From the 1850s, he became well known as a genre painter. In this category belong works such as \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" (1863), \\"Early sorrow\\" (1869), \\"Little Bo Peep\\" (1873 and 1881), \\"Much ado about nothing\\" (1873) and many others.

The title 'Mr' derived from earlier forms of master, as the equivalent female titles Mrs, Miss, and Ms all derived from earlier forms of mistress. Master is sometimes still used as an honorific for boys and young men. The modern plural form is Misters, although its usual formal abbreviation Messrs(.) derives from use of the French title ' in the 18th century.Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd ed. \\"messieurs, n.\\" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 2001. ' is the plural of ' (originally ', \\"my lord\\"), formed by declining both of its constituent parts separately. Historic etiquette Historically, mister was applied only to those above one's own status if they had no higher title such as Sir or my lord in the English class system. That understanding is now obsolete, as it was gradually expanded as a mark of respect to those of equal status and then to all men without a higher style. In the 19th century and earlier in Britain, two gradations of \\"gentleman\\" were recognised; the higher was entitled to use \\"esquire\\" (usually abbreviated to Esq, which followed the name), and the lower employed \\"Mr\\" before the name. Today, on post from Buckingham Palace, a man who is a UK citizen is addressed as \\"Esq\\", and a man of foreign nationality is addressed as \\"Mr\\". In past centuries, Mr was used with a first name to distinguish among family members who might otherwise be confused in conversation: Mr Doe would be the eldest present; younger brothers or cousins were then referred to as Mr Richard Doe and Mr William Doe and so on. Such usage survived longer in family-owned business or when domestic workers were referring to adult male family members with the same surname: \\"Mr Robert and Mr Richard will be out this evening, but Mr Edward is dining in.\\" In other circumstances, similar usage to indicate respect combined with familiarity is common in most anglophone cultures, including that of the southern United States. Professional titles Mr is sometimes combined with certain titles (Mr President, Mr Speaker, Mr Justice, Mr Dean). The feminine equivalent is usually Madam although Mrs is also used in some contexts. All of these except Mr Justice are used in direct address and without the name. In certain professional contexts in different regions, Mr has specific meanings; the following are some examples. Medicine In the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and in some Commonwealth countries (such as South Africa, New Zealand and some states of Australia), many surgeons use the title Mr (or Miss, Ms, Mrs, as appropriate), rather than Dr (Doctor). Until the 19th century, earning a medical degree was not required to become a qualified surgeon. Hence, the modern practice of reverting from Dr to Mr after successfully completing qualifying exams in surgery (e.g., Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons or the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons) is a historical reference to the origins of surgery in the United Kingdom as non- medically qualified barber surgeons. Military usage In the United States Military, warrant officers and chief warrant officers are addressed as Mister by senior commissioned officers. In the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard it is proper to use Mister to refer to commissioned officers below the rank of lieutenant commander, or to subordinate commissioned officers, though the use of Mister implies familiarity compared to the use of rank title for an unknown officer. Women officers below the rank of lieutenant commander may be addressed as Miss, Ms. or Mrs. as appropriate. In the British Armed Forces, a warrant officer is addressed as Sir by other ranks and non- commissioned officers; commissioned officers, particularly of junior rank, should address a warrant officer using his surname and the prefix Mister; for example, \\"Mr Smith\\", although often their rank or appointment is used, for example \\"Sergeant Major\\", \\"Regimental Sergeant Major\\", or \\"RSM\\". In the British Armed Forces a subaltern is often referred to by his surname and the prefix Mister by both other ranks and more senior commissioned officers, e.g., \\"Report to Mister Smithe-Jones at once\\" rather than \\"Report to 2nd Lieutenant Smithe-Jones at once\\". Judges In the Courts of England and Wales, Judges of the High Court are called, for example, Mr Justice Crane (unless they are entitled to be addressed as Lord Justice). Where a forename is necessary to avoid ambiguity it is always used, for example Mr Justice Robert Goff to distinguish from a predecessor Mr Justice Goff. The female equivalent is Mrs Justice Hallett, not Madam Justice Hallett. When more than one judge is sitting and one needs to be specific, one would refer to My Lord, Mr Justice Crane. High Court Judges are entitled to be styled with the prefix The Honourable while holding office: e.g., the Honourable Mr Justice Robert Goff. In writing, such as in the law reports, the titles \\"Mr Justice\\" or \\"Mrs Justice\\" are both abbreviated to a \\"J\\" placed after the name. For example, Crane J would be substituted for Mr Justice Crane. Female judges are still properly addressed \\"My Lord\\", however \\"My Lady\\" is more modernly acceptable. The Chief Justice of the United States may be referred to as either \\"Mr Chief Justice,\\" or \\"Chief Justice.\\" For example, \\"Mr Chief Justice Roberts,\\" or \\"Chief Justice Roberts.\\" Catholic clerics Among Catholic clergy, \\"Mr\\" is the correct title and form of address for seminarians and other students for the priesthood and was once the proper title for all secular and parish priests, the use of the title \\"Father\\" being reserved to religious clergy only. The use of the title \\"Father\\" for parish clergy became customary around the 1820s. A diocesan seminarian is correctly addressed as \\"Mr\\", and once ordained a transitional deacon, is addressed in formal correspondence (though rarely in conversation) as the Reverend Mister (or \\"Rev. Mr\\"). In clerical religious institutes (those primarily made up of priests), Mr is the title given to scholastics. For instance, in the Jesuits, a man preparing for priesthood who has completed the novitiate but who is not yet ordained is properly, \\"Mr John Smith, SJ\\" and is addressed verbally as \\"Mister Smith\\"‚Äîthis is to distinguish him from Jesuit brothers, and priests. (Although, before the 1820s, many Jesuit priests were also called \\"Mr\\".) Orders founded before the 16th century do not, as a rule, follow this practice: a Franciscan or Dominican, for instance, becomes a friar after novitiate and so is properly titled \\"Brother\\" or, if a priest, \\"Father\\". Permanent deacons in the United States are styled as \\"Deacon\\" or \\"the Reverend Deacon\\" followed by their first and last names (e.g., \\"Deacon John Jones\\", rather than \\"the Reverend Mr\\").USCCB, National Directory for the Formation, Ministry and Life of Permanent Deacons in the United States ¬ß88. Washington: 2005. It is also customary in some places, especially in the Eastern Catholic Churches to address deacons while speaking, like presbyters, as \\"Father\\" or \\"Father Deacon\\". Other usages * \\"Mister\\" can also be used in combination with another word to refer to someone who is regarded as the personification of, or master of, a particular field or subject, especially in the fields of popular entertainment and sports. * In Italian football, deference to a coach is shown by players, staff and fans referring to him as \\"Il Mister,\\" or directly, \\"Mister\\". This is traditionally attributed to the conversion of the local game of Calcio to English-rules Association Football by British sailors, who would have been the first coaches. *In the old Dutch title system the title \\"mr.\\" is used for a Master of Laws (LLM) See also * Slavic honorifics * Sri NotesReferences Category:Men's social titles Category:Honorifics ","title":"Mr."},{"id":"26998588","text":"Rui Machado was the defending champion, but chose to compete in Rome instead.

In physics, a field is a physical quantity, represented by a number or tensor, that has a value for each point in space and time. For example, on a weather map, the surface temperature is described by assigning a number to each point on the map; the temperature can be considered at a certain point in time or over some interval of time, to study the dynamics of temperature change. A surface wind map, assigning an arrow to each point on a map that describes the wind speed and direction at that point, would be an example of a vector field, i.e. a 1-dimensional tensor field. Field theories, mathematical descriptions of how field values change in space and time, are ubiquitous in physics. For instance, the electric field is another rank-1 tensor field, and the full description of electrodynamics can be formulated in terms of two interacting vector fields at each point in space-time, or as a single-rank 2-tensor field theory.Lecture 1  Quantum Entanglements, Part 1 (Stanford), Leonard Susskind, Stanford, Video, 2006-09-25. In the modern framework of the quantum theory of fields, even without referring to a test particle, a field occupies space, contains energy, and its presence precludes a classical \\"true vacuum\\". This has led physicists to consider electromagnetic fields to be a physical entity, making the field concept a supporting paradigm of the edifice of modern physics. \\"The fact that the electromagnetic field can possess momentum and energy makes it very real ... a particle makes a field, and a field acts on another particle, and the field has such familiar properties as energy content and momentum, just as particles can have.\\" In practice, the strength of most fields has been found to diminish with distance to the point of being undetectable. For instance the strength of many relevant classical fields, such as the gravitational field in Newton's theory of gravity or the electrostatic field in classical electromagnetism, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source (i.e., they follow Gauss's law). One consequence is that the magnitude of the Earth's gravitational field quickly becomes undetectable on cosmic scales. A field can be classified as a scalar field, a vector field, a spinor field or a tensor field according to whether the represented physical quantity is a scalar, a vector, a spinor, or a tensor, respectively. A field has a unique tensorial character in every point where it is defined: i.e. a field cannot be a scalar field somewhere and a vector field somewhere else. For example, the Newtonian gravitational field is a vector field: specifying its value at a point in space-time requires three numbers, the components of the gravitational field vector at that point. Moreover, within each category (scalar, vector, tensor), a field can be either a classical field or a quantum field, depending on whether it is characterized by numbers or quantum operators respectively. In fact in this theory an equivalent representation of field is a field particle, namely a boson. History To Isaac Newton, his law of universal gravitation simply expressed the gravitational force that acted between any pair of massive objects. When looking at the motion of many bodies all interacting with each other, such as the planets in the Solar System, dealing with the force between each pair of bodies separately rapidly becomes computationally inconvenient. In the eighteenth century, a new quantity was devised to simplify the bookkeeping of all these gravitational forces. This quantity, the gravitational field, gave at each point in space the total gravitational acceleration which would be felt by a small object at that point. This did not change the physics in any way: it did not matter if all the gravitational forces on an object were calculated individually and then added together, or if all the contributions were first added together as a gravitational field and then applied to an object. The development of the independent concept of a field truly began in the nineteenth century with the development of the theory of electromagnetism. In the early stages, Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re and Charles- Augustin de Coulomb could manage with Newton-style laws that expressed the forces between pairs of electric charges or electric currents. However, it became much more natural to take the field approach and express these laws in terms of electric and magnetic fields; in 1849 Michael Faraday became the first to coin the term \\"field\\". The independent nature of the field became more apparent with James Clerk Maxwell's discovery that waves in these fields propagated at a finite speed. Consequently, the forces on charges and currents no longer just depended on the positions and velocities of other charges and currents at the same time, but also on their positions and velocities in the past. Maxwell, at first, did not adopt the modern concept of a field as a fundamental quantity that could independently exist. Instead, he supposed that the electromagnetic field expressed the deformation of some underlying medium‚Äîthe luminiferous aether‚Äîmuch like the tension in a rubber membrane. If that were the case, the observed velocity of the electromagnetic waves should depend upon the velocity of the observer with respect to the aether. Despite much effort, no experimental evidence of such an effect was ever found; the situation was resolved by the introduction of the special theory of relativity by Albert Einstein in 1905. This theory changed the way the viewpoints of moving observers were related to each other. They became related to each other in such a way that velocity of electromagnetic waves in Maxwell's theory would be the same for all observers. By doing away with the need for a background medium, this development opened the way for physicists to start thinking about fields as truly independent entities. In the late 1920s, the new rules of quantum mechanics were first applied to the electromagnetic field. In 1927, Paul Dirac used quantum fields to successfully explain how the decay of an atom to a lower quantum state led to the spontaneous emission of a photon, the quantum of the electromagnetic field. This was soon followed by the realization (following the work of Pascual Jordan, Eugene Wigner, Werner Heisenberg, and Wolfgang Pauli) that all particles, including electrons and protons, could be understood as the quanta of some quantum field, elevating fields to the status of the most fundamental objects in nature. That said, John Wheeler and Richard Feynman seriously considered Newton's pre-field concept of action at a distance (although they set it aside because of the ongoing utility of the field concept for research in general relativity and quantum electrodynamics). Classical fields There are several examples of classical fields. Classical field theories remain useful wherever quantum properties do not arise, and can be active areas of research. Elasticity of materials, fluid dynamics and Maxwell's equations are cases in point. Some of the simplest physical fields are vector force fields. Historically, the first time that fields were taken seriously was with Faraday's lines of force when describing the electric field. The gravitational field was then similarly described. Newtonian gravitation In classical gravitation, mass is the source of an attractive gravitational field g. A classical field theory describing gravity is Newtonian gravitation, which describes the gravitational force as a mutual interaction between two masses. Any body with mass M is associated with a gravitational field g which describes its influence on other bodies with mass. The gravitational field of M at a point r in space corresponds to the ratio between force F that M exerts on a small or negligible test mass m located at r and the test mass itself: : \\\\mathbf{g}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{r})}{m}. Stipulating that m is much smaller than M ensures that the presence of m has a negligible influence on the behavior of M. According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, F(r) is given by :\\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = -\\\\frac{G M m}{r^2}\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}}, where \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}} is a unit vector lying along the line joining M and m and pointing from M to m. Therefore, the gravitational field of M is :\\\\mathbf{g}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{r})}{m} = -\\\\frac{G M}{r^2}\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}}. The experimental observation that inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal to an unprecedented level of accuracy leads to the identity that gravitational field strength is identical to the acceleration experienced by a particle. This is the starting point of the equivalence principle, which leads to general relativity. Because the gravitational force F is conservative, the gravitational field g can be rewritten in terms of the gradient of a scalar function, the gravitational potential Œ¶(r): :\\\\mathbf{g}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = - abla \\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{r}). Electromagnetism Michael Faraday first realized the importance of a field as a physical quantity, during his investigations into magnetism. He realized that electric and magnetic fields are not only fields of force which dictate the motion of particles, but also have an independent physical reality because they carry energy. These ideas eventually led to the creation, by James Clerk Maxwell, of the first unified field theory in physics with the introduction of equations for the electromagnetic field. The modern version of these equations is called Maxwell's equations. =Electrostatics= A charged test particle with charge q experiences a force F based solely on its charge. We can similarly describe the electric field E so that . Using this and Coulomb's law tells us that the electric field due to a single charged particle is : \\\\mathbf{E} = \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0}\\\\frac{q}{r^2}\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}}. The electric field is conservative, and hence can be described by a scalar potential, V(r): : \\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = - abla V(\\\\mathbf{r}). =Magnetostatics= A steady current I flowing along a path ‚Ñì will create a field B, that exerts a force on nearby moving charged particles that is quantitatively different from the electric field force described above. The force exerted by I on a nearby charge q with velocity v is : \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = q\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B}(\\\\mathbf{r}), where B(r) is the magnetic field, which is determined from I by the Biot‚ÄìSavart law: :\\\\mathbf{B}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0}{4\\\\pi} \\\\int \\\\frac{I d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\ell} \\\\times \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}. The magnetic field is not conservative in general, and hence cannot usually be written in terms of a scalar potential. However, it can be written in terms of a vector potential, A(r): : \\\\mathbf{B}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{r}) E fields and B fields due to electric charges (black/white) and magnetic poles (red/blue). Top: E field due to an electric dipole moment d. Bottom left: B field due to a mathematical magnetic dipole m formed by two magnetic monopoles. Bottom right: B field due to a pure magnetic dipole moment m found in ordinary matter (not from monopoles). =Electrodynamics= In general, in the presence of both a charge density œÅ(r, t) and current density J(r, t), there will be both an electric and a magnetic field, and both will vary in time. They are determined by Maxwell's equations, a set of differential equations which directly relate E and B to œÅ and J. Alternatively, one can describe the system in terms of its scalar and vector potentials V and A. A set of integral equations known as retarded potentials allow one to calculate V and A from œÅ and J, and from there the electric and magnetic fields are determined via the relations : \\\\mathbf{E} = -\\\\boldsymbol{ abla} V - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{A}}{\\\\partial t} : \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{A}. At the end of the 19th century, the electromagnetic field was understood as a collection of two vector fields in space. Nowadays, one recognizes this as a single antisymmetric 2nd-rank tensor field in space-time. E fields and B fields due to electric charges (black/white) and magnetic poles (red/blue). E fields due to stationary electric charges and B fields due to stationary magnetic charges (note in nature N and S monopoles do not exist). In motion (velocity v), an electric charge induces a B field while a magnetic charge (not found in nature) would induce an E field. Conventional current is used. Gravitation in general relativity In general relativity, mass-energy warps space time (Einstein tensor G), and rotating asymmetric mass-energy distributions with angular momentum J generate GEM fields H Einstein's theory of gravity, called general relativity, is another example of a field theory. Here the principal field is the metric tensor, a symmetric 2nd-rank tensor field in space-time. This replaces Newton's law of universal gravitation. Waves as fields Waves can be constructed as physical fields, due to their finite propagation speed and causal nature when a simplified physical model of an isolated closed system is set . They are also subject to the inverse-square law. For electromagnetic waves, there are optical fields, and terms such as near- and far-field limits for diffraction. In practice though, the field theories of optics are superseded by the electromagnetic field theory of Maxwell. Quantum fields It is now believed that quantum mechanics should underlie all physical phenomena, so that a classical field theory should, at least in principle, permit a recasting in quantum mechanical terms; success yields the corresponding quantum field theory. For example, quantizing classical electrodynamics gives quantum electrodynamics. Quantum electrodynamics is arguably the most successful scientific theory; experimental data confirm its predictions to a higher precision (to more significant digits) than any other theory.. Also see precision tests of QED. The two other fundamental quantum field theories are quantum chromodynamics and the electroweak theory. Fields due to color charges, like in quarks (G is the gluon field strength tensor). These are \\"colorless\\" combinations. Top: Color charge has \\"ternary neutral states\\" as well as binary neutrality (analogous to electric charge). Bottom: The quark/antiquark combinations. In quantum chromodynamics, the color field lines are coupled at short distances by gluons, which are polarized by the field and line up with it. This effect increases within a short distance (around 1 fm from the vicinity of the quarks) making the color force increase within a short distance, confining the quarks within hadrons. As the field lines are pulled together tightly by gluons, they do not \\"bow\\" outwards as much as an electric field between electric charges. These three quantum field theories can all be derived as special cases of the so-called standard model of particle physics. General relativity, the Einsteinian field theory of gravity, has yet to be successfully quantized. However an extension, thermal field theory, deals with quantum field theory at finite temperatures, something seldom considered in quantum field theory. In BRST theory one deals with odd fields, e.g. Faddeev‚ÄìPopov ghosts. There are different descriptions of odd classical fields both on graded manifolds and supermanifolds. As above with classical fields, it is possible to approach their quantum counterparts from a purely mathematical view using similar techniques as before. The equations governing the quantum fields are in fact PDEs (specifically, relativistic wave equations (RWEs)). Thus one can speak of Yang‚ÄìMills, Dirac, Klein‚ÄìGordon and Schr√∂dinger fields as being solutions to their respective equations. A possible problem is that these RWEs can deal with complicated mathematical objects with exotic algebraic properties (e.g. spinors are not tensors, so may need calculus for spinor fields), but these in theory can still be subjected to analytical methods given appropriate mathematical generalization. Field theory Field theory usually refers to a construction of the dynamics of a field, i.e. a specification of how a field changes with time or with respect to other independent physical variables on which the field depends. Usually this is done by writing a Lagrangian or a Hamiltonian of the field, and treating it as a classical or quantum mechanical system with an infinite number of degrees of freedom. The resulting field theories are referred to as classical or quantum field theories. The dynamics of a classical field are usually specified by the Lagrangian density in terms of the field components; the dynamics can be obtained by using the action principle. It is possible to construct simple fields without any prior knowledge of physics using only mathematics from several variable calculus, potential theory and partial differential equations (PDEs). For example, scalar PDEs might consider quantities such as amplitude, density and pressure fields for the wave equation and fluid dynamics; temperature/concentration fields for the heat/diffusion equations. Outside of physics proper (e.g., radiometry and computer graphics), there are even light fields. All these previous examples are scalar fields. Similarly for vectors, there are vector PDEs for displacement, velocity and vorticity fields in (applied mathematical) fluid dynamics, but vector calculus may now be needed in addition, being calculus for vector fields (as are these three quantities, and those for vector PDEs in general). More generally problems in continuum mechanics may involve for example, directional elasticity (from which comes the term tensor, derived from the Latin word for stretch), complex fluid flows or anisotropic diffusion, which are framed as matrix-tensor PDEs, and then require matrices or tensor fields, hence matrix or tensor calculus. The scalars (and hence the vectors, matrices and tensors) can be real or complex as both are fields in the abstract-algebraic/ring-theoretic sense. In a general setting, classical fields are described by sections of fiber bundles and their dynamics is formulated in the terms of jet manifolds (covariant classical field theory).Giachetta, G., Mangiarotti, L., Sardanashvily, G. (2009) Advanced Classical Field Theory. Singapore: World Scientific, () In modern physics, the most often studied fields are those that model the four fundamental forces which one day may lead to the Unified Field Theory. Symmetries of fields A convenient way of classifying a field (classical or quantum) is by the symmetries it possesses. Physical symmetries are usually of two types: =Space-time symmetries= Fields are often classified by their behaviour under transformations of space-time. The terms used in this classification are: * scalar fields (such as temperature) whose values are given by a single variable at each point of space. This value does not change under transformations of space. * vector fields (such as the magnitude and direction of the force at each point in a magnetic field) which are specified by attaching a vector to each point of space. The components of this vector transform between themselves contravariantly under rotations in space. Similarly, a dual (or co-) vector field attaches a dual vector to each point of space, and the components of each dual vector transform covariantly. * tensor fields, (such as the stress tensor of a crystal) specified by a tensor at each point of space. Under rotations in space, the components of the tensor transform in a more general way which depends on the number of covariant indices and contravariant indices. * spinor fields (such as the Dirac spinor) arise in quantum field theory to describe particles with spin which transform like vectors except for the one of their component; in other words, when one rotates a vector field 360 degrees around a specific axis, the vector field turns to itself; however, spinors would turn to their negatives in the same case. =Internal symmetries= Fields may have internal symmetries in addition to space-time symmetries. In many situations, one needs fields which are a list of space-time scalars: (œÜ1, œÜ2, ... œÜN). For example, in weather prediction these may be temperature, pressure, humidity, etc. In particle physics, the color symmetry of the interaction of quarks is an example of an internal symmetry, that of the strong interaction. Other examples are isospin, weak isospin, strangeness and any other flavour symmetry. If there is a symmetry of the problem, not involving space-time, under which these components transform into each other, then this set of symmetries is called an internal symmetry. One may also make a classification of the charges of the fields under internal symmetries. Statistical field theory Statistical field theory attempts to extend the field-theoretic paradigm toward many-body systems and statistical mechanics. As above, it can be approached by the usual infinite number of degrees of freedom argument. Much like statistical mechanics has some overlap between quantum and classical mechanics, statistical field theory has links to both quantum and classical field theories, especially the former with which it shares many methods. One important example is mean field theory. Continuous random fields Classical fields as above, such as the electromagnetic field, are usually infinitely differentiable functions, but they are in any case almost always twice differentiable. In contrast, generalized functions are not continuous. When dealing carefully with classical fields at finite temperature, the mathematical methods of continuous random fields are used, because thermally fluctuating classical fields are nowhere differentiable. Random fields are indexed sets of random variables; a continuous random field is a random field that has a set of functions as its index set. In particular, it is often mathematically convenient to take a continuous random field to have a Schwartz space of functions as its index set, in which case the continuous random field is a tempered distribution. We can think about a continuous random field, in a (very) rough way, as an ordinary function that is \\\\pm\\\\infty almost everywhere, but such that when we take a weighted average of all the infinities over any finite region, we get a finite result. The infinities are not well-defined; but the finite values can be associated with the functions used as the weight functions to get the finite values, and that can be well-defined. We can define a continuous random field well enough as a linear map from a space of functions into the real numbers.

Life Born on 28 November 1701 in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldersgate, he was the youngest child of Sir Daniel Wray (died 1719), a London citizen and soap-boiler residing in Little Britain, by his second wife. His father was knighted on 24 March 1708, while High Sheriff of Essex, where he possessed an estate near Ingatestone. At the age of thirteen Daniel the son entered Charterhouse School as a day scholar. In 1718 he matriculated from Queens' College, Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1722, and M.A. in 1728. Between 1722 and 1728 he paid a prolonged visit to Italy in the company of James Douglas. On 13 March 1729 he was admitted a fellow of the Royal Society, and on 18 June 1731 he was incorporated at Oxford. He resided generally at Cambridge until 1739 or 1740, but after being elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in January 1741 he became a more habitual resident of London, lodging at the house of Arthur Pond. At a later date he removed to lodgings at Richmond and after his marriage took a house in town, first in King Street, Covent Garden, and afterwards in Duke Street, Soho, and another at Richmond. In 1737 Wray became acquainted with Philip Yorke, and a lifelong friendship grew up. In 1741 Philip and his brother, Charles Yorke, brought out the first volume of the Athenian Letters, to which Wray contributed under the signature \\"W.\\" In 1745 Philip Yorke appointed Wray his deputy teller of the exchequer, an office which he continued to hold until 1782. Wray had many friends among his literary contemporaries, among them Henry Coventry, William Heberden the elder, William Warburton, Conyers Middleton, and Nicholas Hardinge. He was a keen antiquary and collector of rare books, and on 18 June 1765 was appointed one of the trustees of the British Museum. He had younger men as protegees, including Francis Wollaston, George Hardinge, and William Heberden the younger. Wray died on 29 December 1783, and was buried in the church of St. Botolph Without, where there is a tablet to his memory. He married Mary (died 10 March 1803), daughter of Robert Darell of Richmond, Surrey. His portrait by Sir Nathaniel Holland was presented by his widow to Queens' College, Cambridge. Another, engraved by Henry Meyer from a painting by Nathaniel Dance, forms the frontispiece of the first volume of John Nichols's Literary Illustrations. A copy of Dance's portrait by John Powell was presented to the Charterhouse library. In the Literary Illustrations there is an engraving by Barak Longmate of a profile of Wray cut out in paper by his wife, said to be a good likeness, and a copy of a profile in bronze executed in Rome by G. Pozzo in 1726. His library was presented by his widow to Charterhouse in 1785, and a Catalogue was printed in 1790. In 1830 James Falconar published a work entitled The Secret Revealed, in which he made out a case for the identification of Wray as Junius. Works Though Wray wrote much, he published little in his lifetime. He contributed three papers to the first two volumes of Arch√¶ologia on classical antiquities. After his death George Hardinge compiled a memoir to accompany a collection of his verses and correspondence, which he published in 1817 in the first volume of ‚ÄòLiterary Illustrations,‚Äô with a dedication to Philip Yorke, 3rd Earl of Hardwicke. Two sonnets to Wray by Thomas Edwards (1699‚Äì1757) appear in the later editions of Edwards's Canons of Criticism. Hardinge states that a sonnet by Richard Roderick, printed in Robert Dodsley's ‚ÄòCollection of Poems‚Äô (ed. 1775, ii. 321), and again in ‚ÄòElegant Extracts,‚Äô edited by Vicesimus Knox (ed. 1796, p. 838), is also addressed to Wray, but this has been doubted.

The Penetrator required a crew of four (pilot, forward weapons officer, and two rear-facing weapons operators) and could carry six to eight additional passengers. Operational history The prototype aircraft was overhauled by Robert Laura and flying as of 2004.

In the strike of 1839 he favoured a view, in contrast to the majority, that a deal should be struck with the employers. He resigned from the committee but was part of negotiations of the final settlement. In 1840, he took part in reorganization of the existing in London bookbinders' trade union groups which resulted in defection of the London Consolidated Society of Journeymen Bookbinders from the national union.David Goodway.

Aldershot and Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2013, p. 26. He continued to edit the Bookbinder's Trade Circular that he founded until his death in 1873. Dunning married twice, first, on 28 June 1824 taking Susannah Hooper as his wife; and then, after becoming a widower, on 8 September 1840 he married Susannah Heath. Political and economic views Title page of Trades' unions and strikes (1860) Dunning was involved with the Chartist movement in 1840s and collaborated with William Lovett.Golldman, p. 27. He continued to support political franchise after the defeat of Chartism becoming a staunch Liberal. However, as a trade union leader he advised to avoid entanglement in disputes and schemes of major party politics and negatively viewed participation in potentially dividing political campaigns especially when they involved international issues. For example, Dunning advocated non-involvement during the 1863 Polish rebellion crisis and supported the independence of the South in the American Civil War; like some other ex-Chartists, i.e., John Bedford Leno and Patrick Matthew, he distrusted centralization of the federal government in America and compared Abraham Lincoln to Xerxes.Eugenio F. Biagini. Liberty, Retrenchment and Reform. Popular Liberalism in the Age of Gladstone, 1860-1880. Cambridge University Press, 1992, p. 71, n. 244.Gildart, Keith; Howell, David; Kirk, Neville (ed.). Dictionary of Labour Biography, Volume 11. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003, p. 183. Dunning viewed laws regulating relations between employers and employees, such as Master and Servant Acts, as putting industrial labour under \\"the old feudal notion of serfdom\\".Biagini, p. 148. In his writing, he called for industrial harmony but also justified the right of British workingmen, both urban and rural, to strike and unionize in order to raise the price of labour during the ongoing mid-Victorian economic upswing. On the request of the members of his trade union, he wrote and published a pamphlet on the philosophy of trade unionism, Trades' unions and strikes: their philosophy and intention (1860). He argued that employer and employed workmen were not standing on equal footing during bargaining process and encouraged workers to combine into unions to increase their bargaining powers. However, he cautioned against falling into radicalism and anarchy and emphasized that capital and labour \\"are each, notwithstanding these occasional disagreements, the truest friends of the other, and neither can inflict an injury on the other without its recoiling on himself. Capital and Labour should go hand in hand. Experience has amply proved that the Capitalist cannot injure the Labourer, or the Labourer the Capitalist, without each inflicting injury, and perhaps ruin, upon themselves.\\" Trades' Unions and Strikes: Their Philosophy and Intention by Thomas Joseph Dunning, p. 26. He argued that rural trade unionism was not a revolutionary threat: \\"...the landowners and farmers ought to rejoice that it has taken place, for it is of all others a circumstance which if successful, will give stability to their position and render impossible to them similar fate to that of the French nobility and farmers who were swept from the face of the earth for the same kind of oppression. To avert such a catastrophe, success must attend the movement of the agricultural labourers.\\".Biagini, p. 60. He criticised land nationalisation as not only economically inefficient but politically dangerous as it would create a government monopoly. The solution was to liberalise the market through the abolition of primogeniture and the laws of settlement and entail.Biagini, p. 189. Recognition Liberal political economist John Stuart Mill commended Dunning for writing an \\"able tract\\" containing \\"many sound arguments.\\"John Stuart Mill. Principles of Political Economy, 5th edn. London, 1862, Vol. 2, book 5, ch. 10, p. 542. Socialist economists Sydney and Beatrice Webb characterized Dunning as \\"one of the ablest Trade Unionists of his time.\\"Kenneth Lapides. Marx's Wage Theory in Historical Perspective: Its Origins, Development, and. Interpretation. Westport, Conn., and London: Praeger, 1998, pp. 83-84. In his turn, Karl Marx thought highly of Dunning and quoted him several times. Famous quote in Marx's Capital from Dunning's pamphlet, Trades' unions and strikesTrades' unions and strikes: their philosophy and intention, pp. 35-36. runs as: British labour historian Royden Harrison called Dunning, \\"the authoritative voice of the Trades Union oligarchy\\".Royden Harrison. Before the Socialists. Studies in Labour and Politics. 1861-1881. Routledge, 1965, p. 233. Another British historian Lawrence Goldman summarised Dunning's legacy as follows: \\"Dunning and his contemporaries had harnessed the organized working class to the Liberal Party, to liberal political economy, and to the liberal values of equality before the law.\\"Goldman, p. 30. Later life Dunning remained secretary of the London Consolidated Lodge for thirty-one years. In June 1871, he was knocked over by a vehicle, hospitalised with a severe concussion, and partially paralysed. He resigned as secretary, but was granted a pension by the union, and continued to edit the union's newsletter, the Circular, until 1873.

The Sancta Sanctorum () is a Roman Catholic chapel entered via the Scala Sancta (Holy Staircase) of the Lateran Palace in Rome. It was the original private chapel of the papacy before it moved to Avignon, and later to the Vatican Palace. The chapel is the only building from the old Lateran Palace that was not destroyed during its reconstruction.  Name  The chapel acquired the Sancta Sanctorum sometime in the ninth century.\\"The Sancta Sanctorum\\", Scala Santa di Roma The spelling is Sancta, the neuter plural form of the Latin adjective \\"holy\\": this is a reference to the multiple relics preserved there (i.e. \\"the most holy things\\") and to the Holy of Holies in Jerusalem, traditionally called in Latin both sanctum sanctorum (the singular form) or sancta sanctorum. History The founder of the chapel is unknown. It was originally dedicated to Saint Lawrence, and served as the pope's private oratory until the Renaissance. It is located at the top of the Scala Sancta, (\\"Holy Stairs\\"). The first mention of the chapel is found in the Liber Pontificalis, during the tenure of Pope Stephen III (‚Ä†772). It formed part of the Lateran Palace, headquarters of the public offices of the papal court throughout the Middle Ages. Gregory IV (‚Ä†844) had a private apartment built near the chapel to allow him to pray there. It later became part of the Palace and Holy Steps complex commissioned by Sixtus V in 1586.\\"New Display of Sacred Objects from the Sancta Sanctorum\\", Patrons of the Arts in the Vatican Museums, September 1, 2015  Artwork  Sancta sanctorum, cosmateque pavement from 1278 The chapel contains a cypress wood reliquary box, placed under the altar by Pope Leo III (‚Ä†816). It supposedly houses the bones of at least 13 saints (whereof the chapel derives the name \\"holy of holies\\"). The reliquary box itself is taken to represent the Ark of the Covenant in Solomon's Temple. Over the course of time, other relics were added, including the cloisonn√© enameled cross commissioned by Paschal I (‚Ä†824). The opus sectile floor dates from 1278. This style of intarsiated pavement was created in the 12th century by the Cosmati family of stonecutters and widely copied throughout Rome in the 13th century. The chapel also houses an icon of Christ Pantocrator, known as the Veronica, that was supposedly begun by Saint Luke and finished by an angel. It belongs to a class of icons known as acheiropoieta, or images not made by human hands, the most famous of which is the image of Christ‚Äôs face that miraculously imprinted itself on the sudarium of Veronica.

It was noted that in Resolution 976 (1995), the Council expected that UNAVEM III would complete its mandate in February 1997, but that the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol was behind schedule. The Government of Angola and UNITA were reminded of their obligations with regard to maintaining a ceasefire, concluding military talks on integration of the armed forces, the demining process, and commencing the integration of UNITA personnel. There were positive steps taken that would put Angola were welcomed and it was expected that the country would continue quartering of the rapid reaction police, deployment of the Angolan Armed Forces to barracks, the repatriation of expatriate personnel and a programme for disarming the civilian population. In particular, the quartering and disarming of UNITA troops was delayed and in this regard, UNITA was therefore urged to implement this part of the agreement as part of the peace process. Both parties were then asked to cease the broadcast of hostile propaganda through the radio and to contribute towards the impartial UNAVEM radio. Also, the President of Angola and the President of UNITA were encouraged to meet regularly; all countries were reminded to observe the arms embargo against UNITA in Resolution 864 (1993).

Fua Mulaku Havitta (formerly Dhadimagi Havitta) is the ruin of a Buddhist chaitya whose main feature is its ruined stupa.Xavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom The Havitta is located at the northeastern end of Fuvahmulah, Maldives in the historical area of Dhadimagu ward of the island, after which it was named.ﬁäﬁÆﬁìﬁØ ﬁêﬁ∞ﬁìﬁØﬁÉﬁ©: ﬁáﬁ®ﬁÄﬁ™ﬁéﬁ¨ ﬁäﬁ™ﬁàﬁ¶ﬁáﬁ∞ﬁâﬁ™ﬁçﬁ¶ﬁáﬁ∞ÿå ﬁâﬁ®ﬁÄﬁßﬁÉﬁ™ Being the most important center of the Buddhist community in the pre- Islamic period, Dhadimagu was the last ward of the island to have accepted Islam. It was after the acceptance of Islam by the residents of Dhadimagu ward that the Havitta was buried under a mound of sand and one of the temples in the area got converted into a mosque to be known as Gemmiskiy. This happened in the early 1200s under the leadership of Abu Bakr Naib, who completed the conversion process in Fuvahmulah started by his great grandfather Yoosuf Naib in the year 1145 CE. In 1922, when H.C.P Bell saw the ruin, the big Havitta was of about 40 feet in height. A smaller mound, about 15 feet in height, was located nearby. In 1982, their shapes had already been lost because of the damage done by careless diggings to find valuable artifacts or for bungled research purposes, which according to islanders' reports had been made in the 1940s.Xavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean KingdomHeyerdahl, Fua Mulaku (German version, Bertelsmann 1986). p. 53. Until the late 18th century, the residents of Dhadimagu used to live in the proximity of Havitta and surrounding areas. From then onwards, the area started to be used primarily for farming and plantation while the people chose to live only in the southern areas of the ward. Names of the houses which were there in the Havitta area, the families who lived in those houses and plantations of those families in the area, which were passed down from generation to generation can still be traced from related documents and genealogical writings. Apart from that, it can be established from the local oral traditions and the writings of H.C.P Bell, Luthfee and other historians that the Havitta area is located in Dhadimagu ward. Starting from the late 1990s, the Havitta area up to \\"Gemmiskiy Fannu\\" started to be claimed by the then leaders of Hoadhadu ward which became a popular stance among residents of the ward too. This was partly due to the inhabitance of the neighbouring areas by the residents of Hoadhadu as a result of the increase in population and subsequent northerly extension of the ward towards the end of the 20th century. Also, there were other factors like politics, the historical and geographical significance of the area and the important sights it hosts, which contributed to their claim. No historically valid arguments are there for the claim even if it has gained momentum due to political and other factors. Despite these claims, there have been no formal decisions regarding the matter and area claims of different views out of traditional boundaries exist. Even if the houses in close proximity built by settlers from Hoadhadu were registered for Hoadhadu ward due to geopolitical reasons, the areas to the North of Havitta and most of the disputed areas still remain uninhabited and consist of farmlands (known popularly as \\"Dhadimagi Dhadomathi\\" or Dhadimagu farmlands) and woods all the way up to Thoondu, which along with the Havitta are still considered as Dhadimagu areas by many. Apart from the reliable sources and historians, official authorities like Fuvahmulah City Council also identify the Havitta historically with Dhadimagu ward.ﬁäﬁÆﬁìﬁØ ﬁêﬁ∞ﬁìﬁØﬁÉﬁ©: ﬁáﬁ®ﬁÄﬁ™ﬁéﬁ¨ ﬁäﬁ™ﬁàﬁ¶ﬁáﬁ∞ﬁâﬁ™ﬁçﬁ¶ﬁáﬁ∞ÿå ﬁâﬁ®ﬁÄﬁßﬁÉﬁ™ Information board put near the Havitta by Fuvahmulah City Council.

In February 1922, he travelled to Fuvahmulah and briefly examined the remains of the Havitta. However, he stayed on the island for just half a day, not doing excavations. Bell's extensive reports on the 1922 expedition, published in 1922-35 in the Journals of Royal Asiatic Society, and, as a book, posthumously in 1940, link the pre-Islamic Buddhist structures of the Maldives such as the Havitta with those of neighboring Sri Lanka. It was this Havitta, for which Bell was much struck by the close resemblance between it and the dagabas he had previously seen at Anuradhapura. Bell's expeditions remain to be the only professional archaeological excavations ever conducted in the Maldivian Archipelago. As a part of these excavations Bell travelled to some other islands too. Norwegian Thor Heyerdahl also visited this Havitta (in November 1982), but was not allowed to do excavation work; the site had already been ruined by non- professional digging after Bell's visit. Heyerdahl and his comrades, however found stone parts which had fallen down from former fillings which convinced him that on same place, there must also have been a pre-buddhist sacral building. They also discovered two more, but much smaller, mounds nearby.

St. Ninnidh is regarded as one of the Twelve Apostles of Ireland. He is associated with shores of Lough Erne and particularly the island of Inishmacsaint and the parish of Knockninny, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland (derived from the , meaning the Hill of Ninnidh). His feast day is 18 January. Ninnidh of Inismacsaint is often confused with Saint Ninnidh of the Pure Hand who attended Brigid of Kildare on her deathbed.Parke, W.K., The Parish of Inismacsaint, (1973)McKenna, J.E., \\"Inismacsaint\\", Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Ulster Archaeological Society, (1904) Life Ruins of Inishmacsaints Ninnidh was born in County Donegal, a grandson of Laoghaire, the High King of Ireland. He was educated under St. Finian at Clonard, where his fellow students included Ciar√°n of Clonmacnoise, St. Molaise of Devenish and St. Aidan of Ferns. St. Ninnidh preached along the South shore of Lough Erne making the island of Inishmacsaint (Island of the Sorrel Plain) his headquarters around 532. Ciar√°n visited Inishmacsaint in 534. He likely journeyed up and down the Southern portion of Lower Lough Erne in a hollowed- out boat, coming ashore and making his way inland to meet people and spread the gospel.Wakeman, W.F., \\"Some Remarks on the Antiquities of Knockninny, Co. Fermanagh\\", 8 May 1876, Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Royal Irish Academy, 1879. p. 335 After St. Patrick's time, the Celtic Church was divided into many territories and ruled by Abbots of Monasteries, only some of whom were Bishops. St. Ninnidh built a monastery on Inishmacsaint Isle (near Devenish) circa 530A.D. and using the waterways of the time cared for the people from the Erne as far as the sea, sending his priests and monks to the local Churches. In 530 AD Ninnidh held a 40-day fast on Knockninny Hill, during the period of Lent.Knockninney Parish St. Ninnidh's Bell from a sketch in 1877, when the bell's last whereabouts were known. St. Ninnidh's feast day is 18 January. St. Ninnidh's well is situated at Knockninny Quay on the shores of Upper Lough Erne and is reputed to have curative properties for eye ailments. In William Henry's Upper Lough Erne in 1739 the well was described as a chief curiosity, \\"being a plentiful foundation of pure water, having a clearance and coolness scarce to be met with. It was at that time a popular spot for boatspeople to retire to for their entertainments for which and around it are arranged benches of sod and over it a shade of aquatic trees\\". St. Ninnidh's bell, traditionally presented to Ninnidh by St. Senach of Derrybrusk, was kept in Knockninny parish in the 17th century. It was at Castle Caldwell (now incorporated into the Enniskillen Castle Museum in County Fermanagh until 1877, when it was sold at auction to Robert Day of Cork (who sketched the drawing to right). When Day's collection was sold in 1913, this bell was not part of the sale. Although for some time it was identified with a bell in the National Museum of Edinburgh (probably St. Ninian's Bell, formerly from the collection of John Bell), the location of St. Ninnidh's Bell is unknown.√ì Floinn, Raghnall. \\"The Bell of Saint Ninnid of Inishmacsaint, Lough Erne, Co.

This is different from the question of to what extent the policies of one country to reduce emissions affect emissions in other countries (the \\"spillover effect\\" and \\"carbon leakage\\" of an emissions reduction policy). The UNFCCC measures emissions according to production, rather than consumption. Consequently, embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the exporting, rather than the importing, country. The question of whether to measure emissions on production instead of consumption is partly an issue of equity, i.e., who is responsible for emissions. The 37 Kyoto Protocol Parties, listed in Annex B of the treaty, have agreed to legally binding emission reduction commitments. Under the UNFCCC accounting of emissions, their emission reduction commitments do not include emissions attributable to their imports. In a briefing note, Wang and Watson (2007) asked the question, \\"who owns China's carbon emissions?\\" In their study, they suggested that nearly a quarter of China's CO2 emissions might be a result of its production of goods for export, primarily to the USA but also to Europe. Based on this, they suggested that international negotiations based on within country emissions (i.e., emissions measured by production) may be \\"[missing] the point.\\" Recent research confirms that, in 2004, 23% of global emissions were embedded in goods traded internationally, mostly flowing from China and other developing countries to the U.S., Europe and Japan. Research by the Carbon Trust in 2011 revealed that approximately 25% of all emissions from human activities 'flow' (i.e. are imported or exported) from one country to another. The flow of carbon was found to be roughly 50% emissions associated with trade in commodities such as steel, cement, and chemicals, and 50% in semi-finished/finished products such as motor vehicles, clothing or industrial machinery and equipment.

He bowls slow left arm orthodox spin. Kerrigan signed for the Lancashire in September 2008, and made his debut for the first team in 2010, filling in for Gary Keedy, Lancashire's senior spinner. In August 2011, Kerrigan was selected for the England Lions for the first time. The following month he took the best first-class bowling figures for Lancashire since 1953 (9 wickets for 51 runs) and that year Lancashire won the County Championship for the first time since 1950. The 2012 season saw Kerrigan replace Keedy as Lancashire's main spinner in first-class cricket. He made his Test debut against Australia in the fifth Ashes Test played at The Oval in 2013. Career Born in Preston, Lancashire, Kerrigan started his cricket as a junior at Palace Shield Premiership club Fulwood & Broughton before moving on to Ormskirk in the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition. He received his first contract with Lancashire in September 2008 along with ten other young cricketers. In 2009, Kerrigan broke into Lancashire's second team which progressed to the final of the Second XI Championship and the semi-final of the Second XI Trophy. Gary Keedy, Lancashire's experienced and established spinner, suffered a broken collar bone in April 2010, immediately before the start of the English cricket season. With several months on the sidelines, Keedy's absence gave the opportunity to young spinners Kerrigan and Stephen Parry to play first team cricket. Lancashire coach Peter Moores said \\"We're lucky in some ways in that we‚Äôve got Stephen Parry, who played quite a lot of first-team cricket last season, but we‚Äôve also got Simon Kerrigan, who bowled beautifully to take six wickets in the pre-season game against Yorkshire in Barbados and we could also use Steven Crofty's off-spin\\". Kerrigan made his first-class debut in Lancashire's first match of the season taking his maiden five wicket haul and finishing with seven wickets in the match to help Lancashire to victory over Warwickshire. His maiden wicket was that of England cricketer Ian Bell. Kerrigan played 13 first-class matches in his first full season with Lancashire, taking 30 wickets at an average of 32.23 including three five- wicket hauls. When Keedy returned from injury he and Kerrigan sometimes bowled together in the County Championship. However, their partnership was not initially ideal as they were attempting to out perform each other. After a discussion they decided they would be more effective if they worked together to build pressure while bowling. In February 2011, Kerrigan spent 16 days at a spin bowling camp run by the England Cricket Board (ECB). With Keedy in good form, Kerrigan did not play until Lancashire's fourth County Championship match of the 2011 season. The opportunity only arose through injuries to the team's fast bowlers. He took five wickets for seven runs (5/7) in Warwickshire's second innings to take his team to a 147-run victory. Warwickshire's coach and former England spinner Ashley Giles was impressed by Kerrigan's performance. With three wins from four matches, Lancashire moved to the top of the table. Despite limited opportunities in the County Championship because of Keedy's dominance, Kerrigan played ten matches in the CB40 and six twenty20 games. His aim at the start of the season was to be selected for the England Lions, and following an injury to fellow left-arm spin bowler Danny Briggs this was achieved. Kerrigan was called up to the Lions squad to face Sri Lanka A in a three match one-day series in August. While Keedy was frequently chosen over Kerrigan in the County Championship for 2011, Kerrigan cited Keedy's advice as being useful, saying \\"always coming down to you if he thinks you're doing something you shouldn't be doing or maybe what you should be doing\\". In the penultimate County Championship match of the season Kerrigan took career-best innings figures of 9/51 to take Lancashire to a 222-run win over Hampshire. The final wicket of the match was claimed with just four minutes of play left and was greeted with a mini pitch invasion as the victory kept Lancashire in contention for the title. Kerrigan recorded the best bowling figures for Lancashire since Roy Tattersall's 9/40 in 1953. In September, in the last match of the season Lancashire won the County Championship for the first time since they shared the title in 1950. Kerrigan contributed 24 wickets from the four Championship matches he played that season, placing him sixth on Lanashire's list of leading wicket-takers for the competition. On the back of his performances for Lancashire, Kerrigan was included in the 17-man England Performance Programme squad for November and December 2011, during which time he would train in Loughborough and then Sri Lanka where he would gain experience of conditions in the country. He was also included in the 16-man England Lions squad to tour Bangladesh in January 2012. After the Lions lost a five-match one-day series against Bangladesh A 3‚Äì2, Kerrigan was one of four players left out of the squad for the tour of Sri Lanka; Kerrigan took three wickets in as many matches at an average of 44.66. In the year Lancashire began their title defence, Kerrigan succeeded Keedy as the club's first-choice spinner in the County Championship. First-class cricket was the focus of his attention, and he played just three matches in the Clydesdale Bank 40 and none of Lancashire's twenty20 games. Kerrigan finished as Lancashire's leading wicket-taker in the Championship, with 44 wickets at an average of 34.81. He was one of two Lancashire bowlers to take more than 30 wickets in the competition that year (the other was club captain and seam bowler Glen Chapple). Lancashire were relegated to the second division of the Championship. Kerrigan's rise meant Keedy was restricted to four appearances in the County Championship and at the end of the year Keedy left the club. After the English cricket season finished, Kerrigan spent time with the England Performance Squad and practised bowling in limited-overs cricket as Lancashire had preferred Keedy and Parry in their one-day teams that year. Lancashire spent one season in the second division of the County Championship, winning the 2013 division title to seal promotion at the first attempt. Kerrigan played regularly for the England Lions and in August that year was called into the England squad to face Australia in the fifth and final Ashes Test of the summer to share spin bowling duties with Graeme Swann. At that stage of the season Kerrigan had played ten County Championship matches and taken 47 wickets. On 21 August 2013, Kerrigan made his Test match debut along with seam bowling all-rounder Chris Woakes. England had already secured a series victory by winning three of the first four fixtures. Kerrigan bowled eight overs in the match, conceding 53 runs. Shane Watson in particular attacked Kerrigan's bowling en route to his highest Test score. Straight after the 2013 Ashes in England, the return leg was held in Australia from November 2013 to January 2014. Kerrigan was replaced as England's second spinner in the squad by Monty Panesar, but was still included in the England Performance Squad. Graeme Swann retired from international cricket during the series, and Kerrigan's \\"traumatic debut\\" meant that it was unclear who would replace him in the Test team. Moeen Ali was preferred initially, though on 13 July 2014 Kerrigan was called up for the Indian-England 2014 test series. England captain Alastair Cook remarked \\"Clearly he had a tough experience in the one Test he played. He's been good around us and bowled beautifully in the nets (during the first Test). .... Simon is a tough lad - he went away with the Lions and did well. I have no doubt in his toughness and he will be a fine bowler for England.\\" However, he was not selected to play against India and his county form never returned to the level that brought him an England call- up. He was released by Lancashire in 2018, but in 2020 he signed for Northamptonshire, a county he had previously played for on loan.

The manor house is the oldest secular building in the Hove part of the city; some 15th-century features remain, and there has been little change since the High Sheriff of Sussex rebuilt it in the mid-16th century. Local folklore asserts that a 17th-century dovecote in the grounds has been haunted since a monk placed a curse on it. The buildings that comprise the inn were acquired by Hangleton Manor Ltd in 1968, and converted to an inn under the Whitbread banner. The brewery company Hall & Woodhouse have owned and operated it since 2005. English Heritage has listed the complex at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance, and the dovecote is listed separately at Grade II. History The manor of Hangleton has Saxon origins. At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, it was owned by William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey and held by another Norman nobleman, William de Wateville. He was the tenant of several manors in the area, including Bristelmestune (present-day Brighton). The parish of Hangleton covered of the South Downs northwest of Brighton, and consisted mostly of grazing land and chalk downland. Its three main features were on a northeast‚Äìsouthwest alignment: to the northeast, a small village; to the southwest of this, the medieval St Helen's Church and a small pond; and further southwest, the manor house. The village suffered depopulation in the medieval period (perhaps because of greater enclosure for sheep farming, a fire or, most likely, the Black Death). A survey in 1603 recorded only one house in the parish (other than Hangleton Manor and another manor house at Benfields, towards the southwest corner of the parish), and as late as 1931 the population was only 109. The tenancy of the manor passed through several families, including the locally prominent de Cockfields and de Poynings (members of which held it for about 200 years from the 13th century), until in 1538 it came into the possession of Richard Bellingham of nearby Newtimber. He was High Sheriff of Sussex for a time during the mid-16th century. During his 15-year ownership, he rebuilt the main part of the building. Stones from the 12th-century Lewes Priory, demolished in 1537 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, were used and are still visible in the east wall. Further alteration took place later in the 16th century. Part of the building was converted into a scullery, several new windows were inserted along with a door in the porch; a grand staircase was added; and the eastern part of the house was given a new roof and became a single long room with three large windows in the east wall. The Old Manor House‚Äîa long, low wing adjoining the main building on the north and west side‚Äîdates from the 15th century. It has also been altered, but an original doorway remains and some windows of a similar age were inserted into its walls during the 16th-century rebuilding work. Originally used as stables and servants' accommodation, it was later converted into farm buildings and leased by the then-owners of the manor (the Sackville family, whose members held it for over 300 years from 1601) to William Hardwick who was at one time a Brighton exciseman. His sons and their heirs continued to lease the manor and farm for several generations. This use ceased by the mid-20th century, and all separate buildings associated with the farm were demolished. By the 1970s, it had been converted into a house. After farming operations ceased, the main building became an inn and hotel (the Hangleton Manor Hotel). Some renovation work took place in the late 1980s. Various licensees operated it until September 2005, when the brewery company Hall & Woodhouse bought the premises for more than ¬£1,000,000. It now operates under the name Hangleton Manor Inn as a tied house. Architecture Hangleton Manor Inn's 15th- and 16th-century origins make it Hove's oldest secular building. Flint has always been plentiful around the South Downs‚Äîseveral ancient mines (up to 5,000 years old in some cases) have been found across Sussex‚Äîand many buildings on the south face of the Downs are built of the material. Hangleton Manor's buildings are of plain (mostly knapped) flint with some stone and ashlar dressings and quoins. The roofs are hipped and laid with clay tiles, and there are several chimney-stacks at irregular intervals. The complex is L-shaped; the longest (northwest) side is formed by the long, two-storey 15th-century range (the Old Manor House section). A 1925 study noted that it resembled Glynde Place, a flint house of a similar vintage (1560s) at Glynde, near Lewes. The buildings and their grounds are sunk into a sheltered hollow in the undulating downland, which allowed a wide range of plants to be grown when it was still a farm. The Old Manor House part of the building is a two-storey wing with eight bays and a series of regularly spaced windows (all 20th-century replacements of the older windows inserted during the 16th-century rebuilding work) with either square or Tudor arch heads. The west end has a gable. Adjoining its east end is the main building, of two-and-a-half storeys and five bays, with a slightly off-centre two-storey gable-roofed entrance porch in the centre bay. The easternmost bay is gable-ended and has a modern casement window. All other windows have hood moulds with intricate carvings, ovolo-style moulding, transoms and mullions. The eastern side of the main building has a three-bay range and is also two-and-a-half storeys in height. The windows in the outer bays are small and have wooden hood moulds. The centre window is much larger. Inside, alterations have removed some of the original features, but much still remains. A room to the east of the entrance has Corinthian-style pilasters with volute capitals and various carvings, including inscriptions such as the Ten Commandments; it is believed it may have originally been a private chapel, and the wood on which the Commandments and other inscriptions are carved is known to be 17th-century. The room also has high-quality late-16th-century panelling and floor tiles, a Tudor-style moulded ceiling with heraldic emblems, and a piscina (again suggesting a former religious use for this part of the building). The main staircase winds round a square newel and has candle-holders, and in the attic there are the remains of an older staircase of similar design, with oak treads and chamfering. Dovecote A 17th-century dovecote stands in the grounds of the inn. It is circular, built of small flint cobbles laid in a coursed formation. The cone-shaped roof is laid with tiles of clay and sits on top of a frieze of cement. It was restored from a ruinous state in the 1980s: the walls were crumbling and the roof had caved in. The potence (a combined ladder and perch), a standard feature of dovecotes, has a distinctive design, resembling a gate. It, like the roof, has been renewed. The capacity has been variously recorded as 526 or 535 birds, accommodated on blocks of chalk. The wooden door, facing north, has a glazed grille of wrought iron. All restoration work was carried out over several years by a group of volunteers working Wednesdays and Sundays. The work was completed in April 1988 at a cost of about ¬£10,000. It was formally opened by the mayor of Hove in May 1988. Early in the dovecote's existence, a monk‚Äîangered by the droppings left by the birds, placed a curse on it. Since then, the building has reputedly been haunted by ghost pigeons. The buildings today Hangleton Manor and the Old Manor House were jointly listed at Grade II* on 8 November 1956. Such buildings are defined as being \\"particularly important ... [and] of more than special interest\\". As of February 2001, they formed one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. The dovecote was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 24 March 1950. This grade is given to \\"nationally important\\" buildings of \\"special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 1,124 Grade II listed buildings in the city. The inn is operated as a pub and restaurant by Dorset-based brewery Hall & Woodhouse. The building has two separate bars, a 50-capacity restaurant and extensive gardens. There are also living quarters on site.

The constituent states of the German Empire provide a historical example; a contemporary one is the Zulu King, whose power derives from the Constitution of South Africa. Structure and Forms The constituent states of the German Empire (a federal monarchy). Various states were formally suzerain to the Emperor, whose government retained authority over some policy areas throughout the federation, and was concurrently King of Prussia, the Empire's largest state. The British Raj, with the directly administered portions in pink and the theoretically independent (but practically suzerain) Princely States in yellow. This situation can exist in a formal capacity, such as in the United Arab Emirates (in which seven historically independent Emirates now serve as constituent states of a federation, the President of which is chosen from among the Emirs), or in a more informal one, in which theoretically independent territories are in feudal suzerainty to stronger neighbors or foreign powers (the position of the princely states in India under the British Raj), and thus can be said to lack sovereignty in the sense that they cannot, for practical purposes, conduct their affairs of state unhampered. The most formalized arrangement is known as a federal monarchy, in which the relationship between smaller constituent monarchies and the central government (which may or may not have a territory of its own) parallels that of states to a federal government in republics, such as the United States of America. Like sovereign monarchies, there exist both hereditary and elective non-sovereigns. Systems of both formal and informal suzerainty were common before the 20th century, when monarchical systems were used by most states. During the last century, however, many monarchies have become republics, and those who remain are generally the formal sovereigns of their nations. Sub-national monarchies also exist in a few states which are, in and of themselves, not monarchical, (generally for the purpose of fostering national traditions). The degree to which the monarchs have control over their polities varies greatly‚Äîin some they may have a great degree of domestic authority (as in the United Arab Emirates), while others have little or no policy-making power (the case with numerous ethnic monarchs today). In some, the monarch's position might be purely traditional or cultural in nature, without any formal constitutional authority at all. Contemporary Institutions=France The islands that make up Wallis and Futuna Wallis and Futuna is an overseas collectivity of the French Republic in Polynesia consisting of three main islands (Wallis, Futuna, and the mostly uninhabited Alofi) and a number of tiny islets. The collectivity is made up of three traditional kingdoms: Uvea, on the island of Wallis, Sigave, on the western part of the island of Futuna, and Alo, on the island of Alofi and on the eastern part of the island of Futuna. The current co-claimant to the title King of Uvea are Felice Tominiko Halagahu and Patalione Kanimoa, the current King of Alo is Filipo Katoa and the current King of Sigave is Eufenio Takala. They have been reigning since 2016. The territory was annexed by the French Republic in 1888, and was placed under the authority of another French colony, New Caledonia. The inhabitants of the islands voted in a 1959 referendum to become an overseas collectivity of France, effective in 1961. The collectivity is governed as a parliamentary republic, the citizens elect a Territorial Assembly, the President of which becomes head of government. His cabinet, the Council of the Territory, is made up of the three Kings and three appointed ministers. In addition to this limited parliamentary role the Kings play, the individual kingdoms' customary legal systems have some jurisdiction in areas of civil law. Malaysia A number of independent Muslim sultanates and tribal territories existed in the East Indies (the modern-day states of Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, and Brunei) before the coming of colonial powers in the 16th century, the most prominent one in what is now Malaysia being Melaka. The first to establish colonies were the Portuguese, but they were eventually displaced by the more powerful Dutch and British. The 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty defined the borders between British possessions and the Dutch East Indies. The British controlled the Eastern half of modern Malaysia (in a variety of federations and colonies, see History of Malaysia) through a system of protectorates, in which native states had some domestic authority, checked by the British government. The eastern half of Malaysia was part of the independent Sultanate of Brunei until 1841, when it was granted independence as the Kingdom of Sarawak under the White Rajas. The kingdom would remain fully independent until 1888, when it accepted British protectorate status, which it retained until the last Raja, Charles Vyner Brooke ceded his rights to the United Kingdom. The two halves were united for the first time with the formation of Malaysia in 1963. Modern Malaysia is a federal monarchy, consisting of 13 states (of which nine, known as the Malay States, are monarchical) and three federal territories. Of the Malay states, seven are sultanates (Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Pahang, Perak, Selangor and Terengganu), one is a kingdom (Perlis), one an elective monarchy (Negeri Sembilan), while the remaining four states and the federal territories have non-monarchical systems of government. The head of state of the entire federation is a constitutional monarch styled Yang di-Pertuan Agong (In English, \\"He who is made lord\\"). The Yang di-Pertuan is elected to a five-year term by the Conference of Rulers, made up of the nine state monarchs and the governors of the remaining states. A system of informal rotation exists between the nine state monarchs. Montenegro On 12 July 2011, the Parliament of Montenegro passed the Law on the Status of the Descendants of the Petroviƒá Njego≈° Dynasty that rehabilitated the Royal House of Montenegro and recognized limited symbolical roles within the constitutional framework of the republic. New Zealand See: MƒÅori King Movement Waikato, the homeland of the MƒÅori Kings. The MƒÅori of New Zealand lived in the autonomous territories of numerous tribes, called iwi, before the arrival of British colonialists in the mid 19th century. The Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 by about a third of the MƒÅori chiefs, made the MƒÅori British subjects in return for (theoretical) autonomy and preservation of property rights. British encroachment on tribal lands continued, however, leading to the creation of the King Movement (MƒÅori: Kƒ´ngitanga) in an attempt to foster strength through intertribal unity. Numerous tribal chiefs refused the mantle of King, but the leader of the Tainui iwi, P≈çtatau Te Wherowhero, was persuaded, and was crowned as the MƒÅori King in 1857. The federation of tribes supporting the King fought against the British during the territorial conflicts known as the New Zealand Wars (which resulted in the confiscation of four million acres (16,000 km¬≤) of tribal land), not emerging from their refuge in the rural region known as King Country until 1881. The position of the MƒÅori monarch has never had formal authority or constitutional status in New Zealand (which is itself a constitutional monarchy, as a Commonwealth realm). Before its defeat in the Land Wars, however, the King Movement wielded temporal authority over large parts of the North Island and possessed some of the features of a state, including magistrates, a state newspaper known as Te Hokioi, and government ministers (there was even a Minister of Pakeha Affairs [Pakekha being the MƒÅori term for Europeans]). A parliament, the Kauhanganui, was set up at Maungakawa, near Cambridge, in 1889 or 1890. Today, though the monarch lacks political power, the position is invested with a great deal of mana (cultural prestige). The monarchy is elective in theory, in that there is no official dynasty or order of succession, but hereditary in practice, as every monarch chosen by the tribal chiefs has been a direct descendant of Potatau Te Wherowhero (though not always the firstborn child of the previous ruler). Their MƒÅori monarch does not have a physical crown: the \\"coronation\\" is performed by tapping the ascendant on the forehead with a Bible (the same Bible has been used for every monarch since Te Wherowhero). The seventh and current MƒÅori King is Te Arikinui Tuheitia Paki. He was crowned on 21 August 2006, following the death on 15 August of his mother, Queen Te Atairangikaahu, whose forty-year reign was the longest of any MƒÅori monarch. Nigeria The non-sovereign monarchs of Nigeria, known locally as the traditional rulers, serve the twin contemporary functions of fostering traditional preservation in the wake of globalisation and representing their people in their dealings with the official government, which in turn serves to recognise their titles. They have very little in the way of technical authority, but are in possession of real influence in practice due to their control of popular opinion within the various tribes. In addition to this a number of them, such as the Sultan of Sokoto and the Ooni of Ife, retain their spiritual authority as religious leaders of significant parts of the country in question's population. South Africa Dinzulu kaCetshwayo, the last king of an independent Zulu state, in 1883. The Zulu Kingdom was the independent nation state of the Zulu people, founded by Shaka kaSenzangakhona in 1816. The Kingdom was a major regional power for most of the 19th century, but eventually was drawn into conflict with the expanding British Empire, and after a reduction in territory after defeat in the Anglo-Zulu War, lost its independence in 1887, when it was incorporated into the Natal Colony, and later the Union of South Africa. The Zulu Kings remained pretenders to their officially abolished thrones during the 20th century, but were granted official authority by the Traditional Leadership Clause of the republican Constitution of South Africa.Constitution of South Africa, Clause 12, Traditional Leadership The constitution recognizes the right of \\"traditional authorities\\" to operate by and amend systems of customary law, and directs the courts to apply these laws as applicable. It also empowers the national and provincial legislatures to formally establish houses for and councils of traditional leaders. The Zulu King is head of this council of tribal chiefs, known as the Ubukhosi. The current Zulu King is Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, who reigns as King of the Zulu nation, rather than of Zululand, which is today part of the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal. Zwelithini ascended the throne in 1971.  Spain  The Principality of Asturias is an autonomous community and province of Spain. It acceded to this status when the heir to the Castillan and later Spanish throne was given the title of Prince or Princess of Asturias. The current holder is Princess Leonor since June 2014, daughter of King Felipe VI and Queen Laetizia. United Arab Emirates Subdivisions of the United Arab Emirates The numerous small sheikdoms on the Persian Gulf were under informal suzerainty to the Ottoman Empire during the 16th century. Later, this dominance gradually shifted to the United Kingdom. In 1853 the rulers signed a \\"perpetual maritime truce\\", and from that point onward delegated disputes between themselves to the British for arbitration (it is from this arrangement that the territory's former title, the \\"Trucial\\" States was derived). In 1892 this arrangement was formalized into a protectorate in which the British assumed responsibility for the emirate's protection. This arrangement existed until 1971, when the UAE was granted independence. The U.A.E.'s system of governance is unique, in that while the seven constituent emirates are all absolute monarchies, the structure of the federal government itself is not (theoretically, at least) monarchical, as it is in Malaysia. Instead, the formal governmental structure has features of both semi-presidential and parliamentary systems, with some modifications. In purely parliamentary systems the legislature elects the head of government (the Prime Minister) and can force their resignation, and that of the cabinet, through a no-confidence vote, while the head of state is generally appointed or hereditary position without practical power (such as a constitutional monarch or Governor General); in semi-presidential systems the head of state (a President) is popularly elected and takes a role in governing alongside the head of government, though his cabinet is still accountable to the legislature and can be forced to resign. The U.A.E does possess a weak legislature, called the National Federal Council, which is partially elected and partially appointed, but neither the legislature nor the population at large has a hand in determining the country's political leadership. In the U.A.E., it is the Federal Supreme Council (a sort of \\"upper\\" cabinet made up of the seven Emirs), which elects both the head of state (the President) and the head of government (the Prime Minister), both of whom have considerable governing power, to five year terms. This is a purely formal election, however (similar to the later royal elections of Polish Kings), as the rulers of the two largest and wealthiest Emirates, Abu Dhabi and Dubai, have always held the posts of President and Prime Minister, respectively. This Council also elects the lower cabinet, the Council of Ministers, as well of the judges of Supreme Court. The seven constituent Emirates of the U.A.E. are Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah, and Umm al-Quwain. Uganda The administrative divisions of the British Protectorate of Uganda, including five of today's six kingdoms. In 1888, during the Scramble for Africa, the powerful Bantu Kingdom of Buganda was placed under the administration of the Imperial British East Africa Company. In 1894, however, the company relinquished its rights to the territory to the British government, which expanded its control to the neighboring Kingdoms of Toro, Ankole, Busoga, Bunyoro and tribal territories in establishing the Uganda Protectorate, which was maintained until independence was granted in 1961. Upon achieving independence, Uganda became a republic, and its first years were characterized by a power struggle between the Uganda People's Congress and the Bugandan nationalist and monarchist Kabaka Yekka Party. Edward Muteesa II, the King of Buganda, was appointed President and commander of the armed forces, but in 1967 Prime Minister Apollo Milton Obote staged a coup against the Bugandan King in the Battle of Mengo Hill. During Obote's subsequent rule the monarchies were abolished, and remained so during the rule of Idi Amin as well. Restoration of the traditional monarchies came in 1993. The restored monarchies are cultural in nature, and their Kings do not have policy-making power. The Kingdom of Rwenzururu, which did not exist before the 1966 abolition, was officially established in 2008. The areas which now make up the Kingdom were formerly part of the Kingdom of Toro. The region is populated by Konjo and Amba peoples, whose territory was incorporated into the Kingdom of Toro by the British. A secession movement existed during Uganda's early years of independence, and after a 2005 report from the Ugandan government found that the great majority of the regions inhabitants favored the creation of a Rwenzururu monarchy, the Kingdom was recognized by the Ugandan cabinet on March 17, 2008.

The camera scans temporal scenes in the side direction of the path and connect them to the spatial image. This is realized by a program that processes temporal image data or video data in a computer. The route panorama can extend to a long distance for indexing scenes and navigation on the Internet.

Unlike the other doctors with the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia, Fenton was also his own pilot. Fenton was a self-taught pilot, and flew without the aid of any navigation equipment, air charts, and often proper landing strips. He enjoys a particular renown as a unique and dashing Territory character. Biography Clyde Fenton graduated as a medical doctor in 1925 from Melbourne University. He then had a stint in the Royal Air Force in England in 1928. Fenton returned to Australia and headed outback, first to Wyndham, Western Australia and then on to Darwin. Fenton earned his pilot's licence with a goal to join the Royal Flying Doctor Service, but the founder, Reverend John Flynn, had a policy of not using doctors as pilots. As a result, Fenton privately raised money for an aircraft, and in March 1934 arrived in Katherine as the Government Medical Officer. He started an aerial ambulance rescue service which grew into the Northern Territory Aerial Medical Service. Calls for medical assistance came through the two RFDS stations at Cloncurry and Wyndham, and were relayed by telegram. Fenton utilised primitive bush strips and runways to pick up the patients and return them to Katherine for medical treatment. With no navigational equipment or radios, landings were made on strips lit by kerosene flares or car lights, and only the railway lines and the Katherine River were available to estimate his position. To the Civil Aviation Department Fenton was a disaster, but to the people of the Top End, he was a hero. During his career he survived plane crashes, made a flight to China in a small open aircraft, and was once stranded for five days after a forced landing. On 14 May 1940 he received his call up for the RAAF by telegram. He was eventually based at Manbulloo airstrip near Katherine, from where he made many emergency medical flights. In August 1942 the No 6 Communications Flight was formed with Flight Lieutenant Fenton in command. This unit delivered mail and food supplies to army and RAAF outposts, as far afield as the Wessell Islands. The unit was at various times based at the Ross Smith Aerodrome in Darwin, and at the Batchelor airstrip. Fenton left the Territory after the war for Melbourne, where he died on 28 February 1982. One of the planes he flew, a Gipsy Moth, is on display at the Fenton Hangar at the Katherine Historical Society Precinct. His name was also given to a World War II airstrip, Fenton Airfield near Hayes Creek, and is remembered by the Clyde Fenton Primary School in Katherine.

Reforestation, aesthetics and protection of fish and wildlife habitat were not issues of great concern.BC Forest Practices Branch 2006 Alternatives to Conventional Clearcutting In a presentation to the Natural Resources Committee of the Canadian House of Commons in April 1994, Patrick Moore, an early member of Greenpeace, said destructive forest practices ‚Äì not the concept of clearcutting ‚Äì led to a high level of public concern over clearcutting and other forest management issues.Greenspirit Clearcutting ‚Äì Right or Wrong? . . . Both! The use of clearcutting with reserves and variable retention has increased in British Columbia since the late 1990s, and the average size of clearcuts has decreased, improving the balance of environmental and economic objectives.  Clearcutting trends  Until the mid-1990s, most harvesting on public lands in British Columbia involved clearcutting, From 1970 to 1998, clearcutting systems were applied on 87% of the area harvested on public land, and various partial cutting systems on 13%. Advances in knowledge and a shift in the balance of objectives towards conservation of biological diversity led to the use of clearcutting with reserves and variable retention systems. Since 1999, 44% of the area on public lands has been harvested by clearcutting, with the remaining 56% harvested with partial cutting systems. In 2009-2010, harvesting on public lands was by clearcutting with reserves (81%), clearcutting (15%), Retention cutting (3%), Other cutting methods (1%). In 2015-2016, harvesting on public lands was by clearcutting with reserves (85%), clearcutting (11%), Retention cutting (3%), Other cutting methods (1%).Silvicultural Program Statistics Social concerns about large clearcuts led to a decrease in average size from 45 hectares on public lands in 1989 to 30 hectares in 2006. Clearcutting, though the most efficient and least expensive way of harvesting wood, may create difficulties that impede the establishment of regeneration. Obtaining natural regeneration of white spruce in Alaska and boreal Canada after clearcutting has proved to be difficult.Lees, J.C. 1970.

A silviculture system is a planned program of activities that encompasses how trees are harvested, regenerated, and managed over time. Foresters choose a silvicultural system according to the ecological traits of the tree species, and by balancing the objectives of the landowner. Clearcutting removes trees from an area of one hectare or more, and greater than two tree heights in width, in a single harvesting operation. A new even-aged stand is obtained by planting, natural or advanced regeneration, or direct seeding. The opening size and dimensions created are generally large enough to limit significant microclimatic influence from the surrounding stand.BC Ministry of Forests and Range Glossary of Forest Terms It is most appropriate in forest ecosystems where tree species require an abundance of sunlight or grow in large, even-age stands. Clearcutting with reserves is a variation of the clearcutting silvicultural system in which trees are retained, either uniformly or in small groups, for purposes other than regeneration.Borealforest.org Lakehead University Faculty of Natural Resources Management The overstory trees retained, called reserve trees, may be small or large trees, or combinations of small and large trees. They may be retained for future growth, certain species components, current or future den trees, future sources of snags or coarse woody debris, or some level of visual quality.Forest Encyclopedia Network Clearcutting versus deforestation Deforestation is the direct human-induced conversion of forested land to non-forested land. Harvesting when followed by regeneration is not deforestation although forestry operations such as permanent roads are deforestation. Improved practices have increased the success rates for natural regeneration and planting, and have reduced failures by 90% since 1989. The quantity and quality of select seed used are increasing over time. Currently, virtually all logged areas on public lands in British Columbia are reforested within required time frames. The mountain pine beetle epidemic is creating substantial reforestation challenges, compounded by the loss of past silvicultural investments, and areas that are inadequately stocked. The British Columbia government created the Forests for Tomorrow program in 2005 to reforest and restore areas damaged by the mountain pine beetle or wildfire that would otherwise remain unharvested. From 1970 to 2007, British Columbia‚Ä≤s forests decreased in total area by about 12,000 hectares per year due to deforestation (conversion to other land uses). The rate of deforestation has been declining since the 1970s when there was considerable hydroelectric and agricultural development. Since 2000, the annual rate has been approximately 6,200 hectares per year. In 2010, British Columbia introduced the Zero Net Deforestation Act so an equal area of trees is planted for carbon storage to offset any forest land that is permanently cleared for another use. Since 1850, ecosystem conversion to agriculture, reservoirs, urban areas, and other land uses has occurred on a total of 2% of the province. Only the three smallest, warmest biogeoclimatic zones have had more than 10% of their former forests converted. The area harvested each year translates to 0.4% of the forest area in British Columbia, and 0.8% of the forest area that is suitable for harvesting.

The Number-one Volunteer  In December 1864 the dictator of Paraguay, Francisco Solano L√≥pez, ordered the capture of the Brazilian civilian steamship Marqu√™s de Olinda, including its passengers and crew. The Paraguayan army invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (currently the state of Mato Grosso do Sul) immediately afterward without a declaration of war. Four months later, Paraguayan troops also invaded Argentine territory as a prelude to an attack upon the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul. News of the Paraguayan invasions was received with surprise both by the Brazilian government and public. Brazil had previously discounted the war-making potential of neighboring Paraguay. Pedro II, along with most Brazilians, was infuriated at what were seen as unjustified attacks and felt that punitive measures were justified in response. This resolve was strengthened by the Emperor's general antipathy towards all caudillos‚Äîdictators who were common elsewhere in Latin America. Emperor Pedro II wearing a southern Brazilian (Ga√∫cho) traditional outfit during his visit to Uruguaiana in the province of Rio Grande do Sul, 1865. Nevertheless, Pedro II tried to pacify the nation in a speech from the throne on 6 May 1865 during which he addressed concerns such as public health, the economy, and the marriages of his daughters. He calmly made only brief mentions of the ongoing conflict with Great Britain and the Paraguayan invasion. He was reluctant for the Empire to become further entangled in the problems of the Platine region, as he affirmed in his diary in 1862: \\"After the war against Rosas, I was always a partisan for Brazil's abstention from the affairs of the Plata, excepting harm to the national honor and Brazilian interests.\\" Even so, he strongly supported the cabinet in its decision to counterattack. The invasion of Rio Grande do Sul became known in the capital on 30 June 1865. Aware of the anarchy in the province and the incapacity and incompetence of its military chiefs to resist the Paraguayan army, Pedro II decided to go to the front in person. He wrote to the Countess of Barral: \\"Rio Grande do Sul has been invaded, my place is there\\". As Head of State, he intended to assume command of the Brazilian army. Both the Cabinet and the General Assembly refused to accede to the Emperor's wish. The senators and general deputies, using their constitutional prerogatives, refused to grant permission for the travel. If something happened to the Emperor, the throne would be inherited by his 18-year-old daughter Isabel. The risks to the stability of the country were considered too great at that critical moment. After he also received objections from the Council of State, Pedro II made the memorable pronouncement: \\"If they can prevent me from going as an Emperor, they can not prevent me from abdicating and going as a Fatherland Volunteer\\". Thus those Brazilians who signed up to go to war under Decree 3,371 of 7 January 1865 became known throughout the nation as the \\"Fatherland Volunteers.\\" The monarch himself was popularly called the \\"Number-one Volunteer.\\" Emperor of Brazil leaves the harbor of Rio de Janeiro aboard the Santa Maria, to put himself at the head of the troops fighting against Paraguay. Pedro II left for the south on 7 July 1865 (some authors state instead that he left on 10 July) and was greeted by crowds, along with the national anthem and patriotic celebrations. Accompanying him were his son-in- law the Prince Ludwig August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, his Aide-de-camp General Francisco Xavier Calmon Cabral da Silva (later the 2nd Baron of Itapagipe), the Vice Admiral William Parker, the Minister of War √Çngelo Ferraz, his Aide-de-Camp the Marquis of Caxias, Admiral Joaquim Raimundo de Lamare, General Beaurepaire Rohan, and an escort of 300 soldiers. Upon embarking, he said: \\"I am the perpetual defender of Brazil, and when my fellow citizens sacrifice their lives in holocaust upon the altar of the fatherland in defense of such saintly cause, I will not be the one who refuses to follow them.\\"  Siege of Uruguaiana  The Emperor of Brazil with his two sons-in- law, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the Count of Eu, in Alegrete, southern Brazil (by Janet-Lange, published at L'Illustration, 1865). Pedro II disembarked in Rio Grande do Sul on 16 July and proceeded from there by land with his escort of 300 men. The trip was made by horse and wagon, and at night the emperor slept in a campaign tent. On 1 August at Ca√ßapava he was joined by his other son-in-law, Gaston d'Orl√©ans, the Count of Eu, who had arrived from Europe where he had been spending his honeymoon. From Ca√ßapava he traveled to S√£o Gabriel, and on 5 September passed through the Campo do Ros√°rio (Field of the Rosary), where 37 years earlier Brazilian troops were defeated by Argentine and Uruguayan forces. General Francisco Xavier Calmon, who had participated in the battle and was traveling with the Emperor, related his memories of the event. In S√£o Gabriel the Emperor said farewell to Jo√£o Prop√≠cio Mena Barreto, Baron of S√£o Gabriel, former commander-in-chief of the Brazilian Army during the Uruguayan War, who was dying of tuberculosis. He also visited the hospitals and talked with the wounded. Pedro II also had his first contact with the Paraguayans when he talked with three prisoners of war. He spoke in guarani and offered them an opportunity to return to Paraguay. The Paraguayans refused, alleging that they would be put to death by Lopez for having been taken prisoner. These Paraguayan soldiers, who had hated the monarch without ever having met him, began to admire him greatly and called him Murubichab (\\"Great Chief\\" in guarani). The Emperor, for his part, felt pity for the Paraguayan people and was convinced that Lopez‚Äôs dictatorship was barbarous and must be overthrown at any cost. Surrender of Uruguaiana, 1865. From left to right: Unknown Paraguayan soldier, Father Duarte, unknown Paraguayan Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Estigarribia, Minister √Çngelo Ferraz (delivering Estigarribia's sword), Emperor Pedro II, Venancio Flores, Bartolom√© Mitre, the Count of Eu, the Marquis of Caxias and the Baron of Porto Alegre, along with other unidentified Brazilian Officers. After quickly passing Alegrete Pedro II arrived in Uruguaiana on 11 September, where he joined Admiral Joaquim Marques Lisboa (then Baron of Tamandar√©), General Jo√£o Frederico Caldwell, General Manuel Luis Os√≥rio (later Marquis of Erval) and Manuel Marques de Sousa (then Baron of Porto Alegre and also commander of the besieging forces). Uruguaiana had been taken by the Paraguayans under Lieutenant Colonel Antonio de la Cruz Estigarribia with a force of 10,000 men on 5 August 1865. By the time of the Emperor's arrival, Estigarribia's force was reduced to only 5,500 men, while the besieging army composed of Brazilians, Argentines and Uruguayans was 17,000-strong. Pedro II also met the Argentine president Bartolom√© Mitre and Uruguayan president Venancio Flores, who were commanding the troops of their respective nations. A quarrel developed in the allied camp: Mitre demanded supreme command of the allied army in accordance with the Treaty of the Triple Alliance. The Brazilian military leaders refused to accept this, since the same treaty affirmed that on Brazilian soil the command would be held by a Brazilian. Pedro II amicably persuaded all to accept his proposal: the allied forces would be divided in three columns, each under the command of a chief of their own nationality, while he would act as a Moderating Power to mediate conflicts between the three commanders, thus becoming de facto and de jure commander of the allied army. The Emperor rode within rifle shot of Uruguaiana to demonstrate his courage, but the Paraguayans did not attack him. The strategies proposed by the commanders conflicted: Os√≥rio suggested that they should destroy the village using artillery, since all its (Brazilian) inhabitants had run away before it had fallen to the Paraguayans. Tamandar√© and Flores, on the other hand, pushed for an initial bombardment followed by an advance of the allied troops. Pedro II wished to prevent the bloodshed of a battle and called on Estigarribia to surrender. Estigarribia did so on the condition that he would surrender only to the Brazilian Emperor, as he did not trust his fellow republicans from Argentina and Uruguay. The Paraguayan troops paraded in front of the allies and the sword of Estigarribia was solemnly delivered by the minister Ferraz to Pedro II. By \\"his example and his actions he had contributed decisively to the expulsion of the Paraguayan invaders from Brazilian soil.\\" The Paraguayans were malnourished and practically naked. Pedro II did not feel proud of the victory and wrote to the Countess of Barral: \\"Yesterday we entered into Uruguaiana. The enemy was unworthy even of being defeated. What a rabble!\\" There was a general belief that the war was near its end and that it was only a matter of time until L√≥pez surrendered. Because of this, Pedro II decided to return to Rio de Janeiro. Before leaving Uruguaiana, he received the British ambassador Edward Thornton, who publicly apologized on behalf of Queen Victoria and the British Government for the crisis between the empires. The emperor considered that this diplomatic victory over the most powerful nation of the world was sufficient and renewed friendly relations between the nations. He returned to Rio de Janeiro and was received with great joy and celebration everywhere.  Victory  The war's cost came to R$614.000:000$000 (see Brazilian currency), which was paid as follows: R$265.000:000$000 from taxes, R$171.000:000$000 from bond sales, R$102.000:000$000 in new money issued, R$27.000:000$000 from internal loans and R$49.000:000$000 from foreign loans. Thus, only 7.9% of the total war debt was composed of external loans. However, Brazil was so prosperous that the government retired the war debt in only ten years. The conflict was a stimulus to national production and economic growth. After more than five years of war, the emperor seemed to have aged twenty years: his blond hair and beard had become completely grey and at age 44 his face seemed to be of a sexagenarian. Pedro II's popularity, which had suffered during the long conflict, immediately recovered upon final victory. The Emperor turned down the General Assembly's suggestion to erect an equestrian statue of him to commemorate the victory and chose instead to use the money to build elementary schools.

He is best known for depicting the life of Greek-American immigrants in the Greektown neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois.  Early life  Petrakis is the son of the Reverend Mark Petrakis, a Greek Orthodox priest who immigrated to the United States with his wife Stella in 1916. They were villagers from central Crete, the village Vilandredon,Œü œÄœÅœéœÑŒøœÇ ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒøœÅŒ∏œåŒ¥ŒøŒæŒøœÇ ŒπŒµœÅŒ≠Œ±œÇ œÉœÑŒ∑ Utah (ŒìŒπŒøœçœÑŒ±) œÑœâŒΩ ŒóŒ†Œë ŒúŒ¨œÅŒ∫ŒøœÇ Œ†ŒµœÑœÅŒ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ ŒºŒµ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ≥œâŒ≥ŒÆ Œ±œÄœå œÑŒø ŒíŒπŒªŒ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒµŒ¥Œø Œ°ŒµŒ∏œçŒºŒΩŒøœÖ œÉŒµ œÜœâœÑŒøŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒØŒ± œÑŒøœÖ 1916 ŒºŒµ œÑŒ∑ œÉœçŒ∂œÖŒ≥œå œÑŒøœÖ Œ£œÑŒ≠ŒªŒªŒ± Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑŒ± œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒπŒ¨ œÑŒøœÖœÇ near the city of Rethymnon, who came bringing their first four children (Dan, Barbara, Manuel, and Tasula). Harry Mark, the fifth child, was born on June 5, 1923, in St. Louis, Missouri. A sixth child, Irene, was later born in Chicago, where the family settled. Harry Mark (Greek name, \\"Haralambos\\") attended Koraes School, the elementary school of Sts. Constantine & Helen Greek Orthodox Church, his father's parish in Chicago. During Greek school days he read his original poems and played the lead roles in class productions of Greek tragedies. He also learned to read and write the Greek language, which he spoke at home (although he never writes in Greek). He also met his future wife in Greek school, a Greek-American girl named Diana Perparos, whose father John owned several dry cleaning and shoe repair stores in Chicago. Despite being the son of a priest, Petrakis belonged to a gang, which was made up of sons of immigrants of varied ethnic ancestry in their Woodlawn neighborhood. Later, in Stelmark, one of his numerous autobiographical works, he recalled: At age 11 Petrakis contracted tuberculosis. He was placed on bed rest and ended up missing two years of school. He later wrote, \\"Those two years were a strange, intense period for me, weeks and months of boredom, excitement, discovery, despair, and terror. They affected my life, I am certain, more than any other interlude of my childhood and youth\\" (Stelmark, p. 86). He passed the time reading in bed. As a grown man he would later refer to books as \\"a refuge ... a sanctuary against a growing depression bred by inactivity\\" (from his Song of My Life, p. 18). One of the books that influenced him most was Martin Eden by Jack London, in which a self-educated sailor dreams of becoming a writer. He also read The Book of Knowledge in its entirety. After getting well Petrakis returned to Englewood High School, on Chicago's Southwest Side. He excelled at military exercises, but started playing hooky from school. Finally, he ceased attending at all. His father, seeing his son's abhorrence of school, sent him to stay with his brother Manuel at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Petrakis was enrolled in high school in Urbana but shortly became truant again, skipping school and often spending the day reading in one of the university libraries. Learning of this, his father brought him back to Chicago and enrolled him in a parochial school which specialized in disciplining troublesome youths, but where Petrakis lasted only two weeks. He never graduated from high school. Nevertheless, in later years he would be awarded six honorary doctorates and would teach at the university level, as for instance when he held the Nikos Kazantzakis Chair in Modern Greek Studies at San Francisco State University, or when he acted as the McGuffey Visiting Lecturer at Ohio University.  Gambling addiction  Like many youths without a high school diploma, Petrakis turned to gambling to make a living. Starting when he was 16 years old, he and an older betting buddy would study the Daily Racing Form while his parents thought he was attending school. In his 2014 autobiography Song of My Life, Petrakis recounts how he pawned his brother's suits, sold his sister's books, and stole from cash registers to get money to feed his habit. One morning, he recalls, he went to his father, who never refused him money, and borrowed $200‚Äîthe parish priest's whole monthly salary‚Äîfrom him in order to pay the gas and electric bills on the studio apartment where he was living with his wife, who was pregnant. By afternoon, he had gambled it all away. Looking back, he views that day as the first step toward his deliverance. Having betrayed his wife and father, he says, marked the beginning of his healing. He gambled less and less over the next few months and finally stopped.  Early writing years  After quitting gambling, Petrakis embarked upon a series of odd jobs that he often quit. Lacking a high school diploma, he worked as a Railway Express baggage handler, a steel mill worker, a customer service rep at a manufacturer of auto waxes and furniture polishes, a beer truck driver, a clothes presser in a dry- cleaning plant, a real estate salesman, an advertising copywriter, and a junior-level speechwriter for executives at U.S. Steel. He also entered the restaurant business, owning and operating a small lunchroom at 13th Street and Indiana Avenue in Chicago called Art's Lunch. At night, however, he would work on his writing. For 10 years he continually submitted manuscripts to various literary magazines that published short stories. Finally, in 1956, at the age of 33, he sold his first story. It was titled \\"Pericles on 31st Street\\" and was published by the Atlantic Monthly, which gave it one of its \\"Atlantic Firsts\\" awards. After that, Petrakis continued to publish in the Atlantic. In addition, he wrote \\"The Wooing of Ariadne\\" for The Saturday Evening Post and \\"Dark Eye\\" for Playboy Magazine. Another of his stories, \\"The Prison,\\" won an O. Henry Award (1966); and, in addition, an anthology of his short stories with the title \\"Pericles on 31st Street\\" was named a finalist for the National Book Award for Fiction (1966).  A Dream of Kings  In 1966 Petrakis made his first international success with the appearance of his novel A Dream of Kings, which won him a nomination for the National Book Award for Fiction for the second year in a row. A Dream of Kings was on the New York Times Best Seller list for 12 weeks, translated into 12 languages, and made into a Hollywood film of the same name. The lead role of Leonidas Matsoukas was played by actor Anthony Quinn, already familiar to Americans from having played Zorba in the earlier film Zorba the Greek (1964). Quinn's characterization of Matsoukas as a passionate Greek immigrant full of lust for life was so like Zorba that he was termed by one critic \\"Zorba the Greek- American.\\" The film of A Dream of Kings was released in 1969 by National General Pictures and was directed by Daniel Mann, who had previously worked with actors Burt Lancaster, Anna Magnani and Elizabeth Taylor.  Middle period  A Dream of Kings had been published by the David McKay Company, which also published Petrakis's short story anthology The Waves of Night (1969). McKay also brought out his next novel, In the Land of Morning, It came out in 1973, when the Vietnam War was in the American news every night, and has as the central character a young Greek-American veteran coming back from Vietnam who is of the same generation as Petrakis's three sons (Mark, John and Dean). There then followed a period at the publishing house of Doubleday, which published four of Petrakis's books between 1976 and 1983. All four had Greek themes. The Hour of the Bell is set during the Greek War of Independence (1821-1932), in which patriotic Greek forces expelled the ruling Turks who had been there since the fall of Greece to the Ottoman Empire in the year 1453. As he wrote, Petrakis felt inspired: Doubleday also published A Petrakis Reader (1978), an anthology of short stories with primarily Greek or Greek-American characters. At about this time Petrakis started making numerous public speaking appearances in which he would read his stories aloud. Doubleday also published Nick the Greek, the fictionalized life story of the legendary professional gambler Nick \\"The Greek\\" Dandolos; and Days of Vengeance, a historical novel of Cretan immigrant men working in the Utah coal mines in the early 1900s.  Depression  In 1982 Petrakis underwent an illness and accompanying depression that almost ended his life. Following knee surgery for a tennis injury, he developed a drop foot. He became anxious and made the rounds of the neurologists. One diagnosed him with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). Not yet knowing that the ALS diagnosis would prove to be incorrect, Petrakis decided he would not wait passively for the crippling decay of the disease. He bought a gun, thinking to kill himself. The night he intended to do it, however, a last-minute phone call to his wife made him long for a few more hours with her before the end. From that point, his depression began to lift. As part of his gradual ascent toward recovery, Petrakis talked and wrote much about his illness, which did not turn out to be ALS. For example, he described his depression to the Chicago Tribune in a 1990 interview titled \\"A Writer's Odyssey.\\" And when he wrote Ghost of the Sun, the 1990 sequel to A Dream of Kings, he depicted all three of the neurologists visited by the now-old, now- sick Matsoukas as near-barbarians.  Later writings  In the 2000s Petrakis began writing for Southern Illinois University Press. They published his Twilight of the Ice, about the days when Americans still had ice delivered to the iceboxes in their homes; The Orchards of Ithaca, in which a Greek restaurateur comes to the defense of a Greek Orthodox priest falsely accused of child molestation; The Shepherds of Shadows, a sequel to The Hour of the Bell; and Legends of Glory and other stories, a collection of short stories centering on Chicago Greeks. His most recent short story anthology is Cavafy's Stone and other village tales (Wicker Park Press, 2010), all of whose stories take place in the same fictional village in Greece. As of 2015, Petrakis is still producing work regularly. His latest book is a full-length autobiography, Song of My Life.

His works illustrate a great number of books, scientific papers, private collections and museums in many parts of the world. He currently works in association with the Natural Science Museum in Madrid.Museo de Ciencias Naturales, Madrid, Spain Life and career Skull and head of Simocyon, 2005 As a teenager in Caracas (Venezuela) in the 1970s, Ant√≥n became fascinated with the skeleton of the saber-tooth cat Smilodon fatalis on exhibition at the local museum. Ever since, he has been working and improving his techniques to bring fossils alive, being especially interested in felids, hominids and other vertebrates. As he puts it in one of his books (El secreto de los f√≥siles) ‚ÄúIt is the responsibility of the scientific paleo-illustrator to make sure that his images rigorously transmit the knowledge that the paleontologists have gathered from specific extinct species.‚Äù To do this he gathers data from extant species, travelling the world extensively, working hands on fossils, dissecting specimens donated by zoos, researching extinct species with specialists and using extant ecosystems as a basis for the reconstruction of past ones. He has been an advisor on paleobiology, biomechanics, animal locomotion, and habitats of extinct vertebrates for various media (BBC, National Geographic Society, Natural History, Discovery Channel, etc.). He has benefited from the influences of paleoart masters such as Charles R. Knight, Rudolph Zallinger, Zdenek Burian, Jay Matternes and others from whom he not only recognizes the technological advances but also the conceptual progress they made. Since the year 2004, he has been working in collaboration with \\"The Fly Factory\\" animation studiosThe Fly Factory in the application of 3D modeling and animation to the reconstruction of past life. In 2006, he won the Lanzendorf PaleoArt Prize for the best scientific illustration from the SVP (Society of Vertebrate Paleontology).John Lanzendorf paleoart prize In 2009, he was invited by the Chinese Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and PaleoanthropologyChinese Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology to visit their Beijing Museum and also the new Museum and fossil sites at Hezheng in central China, where he made first-hand observations of undescribed carnivore fossils.

From 1989 onward he built an industrial investment group, Androsch International Consulting (AIC), which is a major factor in Austria's internationally active corporate landscape. In addition, Androsch's foundation is an important sponsor of research and development activities in Austria, where he is regularly consulted on matters of political, economic and financial importance.  Youth and early political activities  Androsch was born on 18 April 1938 in Vienna, where his parents, Hans and Lia, were tax advisors in the district Floridsdorf. The family lived through the end of World War II in Southern Bohemia, where they witnessed the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia in June 1945. His mother placed seven-year-old Hannes on the window sill and instructed him to watch the events closely so that he would never forget.Palme, Liselotte. Androsch. Ein Leben zwischen Geld und Macht. Androsch concluded his high school education in Vienna in 1956. He proceeded to study business administration at the University of World Trade (today's Vienna University of Economics and Business), where he obtained his diploma in 1959, followed by a doctorate in 1969. His political activities manifested early, and took him to the top position in the Vienna branch of the student organization of the Socialist party (1960‚Äì1961), and then to leadership of the national organization (1962‚Äì1963). Thereafter, at the age of only 25 years, he became secretary for economic issues in the club of the Socialist members of parliament, a position which he held until 1966. Rise and fall as a politician 1967 was a fateful year for Androsch: he was certified as a public accountant and tax advisor, allowing him to participate in the financial consulting enterprise which his parents had significantly expanded; and he became a member of parliament for the Socialist party where he earned himself a reputation as a shooting star. When Bruno Kreisky turned the tables on Austria's political scenery with the 1970 national election he made the 32-year-old Androsch Finance Minister in his first minority cabinet on 21 April 1970. Androsch continued in this function when the Socialist single- party government consolidated its dominance through the absolute majorities won in the elections of 1971 and 1975. Although he had not been Kreisky's first choice for this position (Schachner-Blazizek and Felix Slavik had declined) the two men developed a working relationship that was, initially, very good. Androsch became a strong advocate of Keynesian economics, in a modification that became known as ‚ÄúAustro-Keynesianism.‚Äù On 1 October 1976 Androsch was made Vice-Chancellor of Austria while remaining minister of finance. In this capacity he became chairman of the OECD at ministerial level in 1979, and also served as chairman of the Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund. While Androsch had built an excellent political network within the centrist wing of the Socialist party and especially the Austrian Trade Union Federation (√ñGB), not everybody was happy with his rapid rise. The fact that the Austrian print media, who for the most part venerated Kreisky and had adorned him with the nickname \\"Sun King,\\" started to refer to Androsch as the \\"Crown Prince\\" did not help. When in 1975 Androsch differed with Kreisky on how to handle the reconfiguration of Austria's state-owned industry, and expressed his wish to become president of the national bank instead of continuing in the government, Kreisky himself became suspicious of the young man he had mentored for years. He started to take exception to a highly problematic incompatibility that had been public knowledge since Androsch became a member of the government: he still owned the tax advisor company (renamed Consultatio in 1970) which he had taken over from his parents, although he had placed it in escrow when he became a finance minister. Towards the end of 1980, after long and intense campaigns by Austria's media and a continued deterioration of his relationship with Kreisky, Androsch resigned from his political positions on 20 January 1981. Second career as a banker The government appointed Androsch as the governor of the state-owned Creditanstalt, Austria‚Äôs leading bank at that time, a little later in 1981. However, he continued to face heavy opposition and revelations made by investigative journalists (especially Alfred Worm), that culminated in a series of investigations of his personal financial conduct, which in part predated his public role or were not demonstrably connected with it. Androsch has repeatedly stated (and has repeated these allegations in a series of interviews published by the Austrian newspaper \\"Die Presse\\" in February and March 2010; see sources) that his Socialist successors in the finance ministry, Herbert Salcher and Franz Vranitzky (who had been Androsch's secretary, and would later rise to chancellorship) had conspired with Kreisky, \\"who was simply jealous\\", (and with political opponent Alois Mock) to \\"construe the financial and legal proceedings against him\\", that would not be finally settled for the following 16 years. \\"I had no chance to even be heard. And many who have participated in this vendetta would now rather pretend that nothing had ever happened.\\" A central point of Androsch's defence concerning his personal finances ‚Äî he claimed that a rich \\"uncle-by- choice\\" (\\"Wahlonkel\\" in German) had provided him with significant funds, and habitually replied \\"alas, no\\" when asked if he was a millionaire ‚Äî did not hold. On 8 October 1991 Androsch was convicted by the Vienna Regional Criminal Court of having evaded taxes between 1974 and 1983 in the amount of about five million Austrian schillings (roughly corresponding to EUR 500,000 expressed in 2010 currency), a minuscule fraction of the original allegations. He was sentenced to a fine of 1.8 million Austrian schillings. A legally separate but politically related affair (a conviction for false testimony to the parliamentary examination board investigating the scandal surrounding the Vienna General Hospital) forced Androsch to resign from the Creditanstalt post in January 1988. With the help of a Swiss member of the Bilderberg Group,Androschs Lebensbilanz Interview published in NEWS No. 15/2008 (see p. 63) he became a consultant to the World Bank, especially for China and parts of Africa, until 1989. Androsch is a former member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group. Third career as an industrial investor In 1989 Androsch founded AIC Androsch International Management Consulting GmbH, which in 1994 commenced its corporate investment and acquisition activity. Its offices are situated at the Ringstra√üe, opposite the Vienna opera house. By way of AIC, Androsch is co-owner and president of the supervisory board of the following Austrian companies: *Austria Technologie und Systemtechnik (AT&S;) AG, Europe's largest manufacturer of printed circuit boards with offices in Vienna and Leoben *Salinen Austria AG, Austria's salt mining and processing company and a significant player in Europe *bwin.com Interactive Entertainment AG, a developer and marketer of online gambling and gaming products in Vienna Former investments of Androsch's holdings included major stakes in Future Advanced Composite Components (FACC) AG in Ried im Innkreis (acquired by Xi'an Aircraft Industrial Corporation in 2009) and in KTM Sportmotorcycle AG. In 2000, he was a major founding investor of Austrian prepaid payment method paysafecard, until it was finally sold to British Skrill group for 140 million euros in 2014. Androsch is also president of the supervisory board of the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT; formerly Austrian Research Centers, ARC) in Seibersdorf, and deputy chairman of the supervisory board of FIMBAG Finanzmarktbeteiligung AG,FIMBAG company information Archived the vehicle through which the state-owned √ñsterreichische Industrieholding controls its stakes in Austrian banking system. He has been chairman of the Council of the University of Leoben. Following the collapse of Refco, a class-action lawsuitsuit in the US caused considerable difficulties for BAWAG P.S.K., the Austrian trade union's bank. Androsch and other Austrian investors formed a consortium with Cerberus Capital Management, which acquired the bank in 2006.BAWAG P.S.K. Company History (2005-2008) Archived In 2006 the Austrian economics magazine trend estimated Androsch's wealth at EUR 420 million, ranking him 25th among the wealthiest Austrians.Die reichsten √ñsterreicher Ranking of the wealthiest Austrians in 2006 by trend magazine Archived Using a modified rating that also considered networking, the magazine ranked him the 22nd most powerful person in Austria's economy in 2009.Die 100 M√§chtigsten in der Wirtschaft. trend 7/2009, p. 53 Research sponsorships On 21 June 2004, the founding session of the Hannes Androsch Foundation within the Austrian Academy of Sciences was held. It is dedicated to \\"the consolidation of social balance and peace.\\" Androsch endowed it with EUR 1 million and committed himself to increase the annual budget to EUR 10 million until 2012. It awards the Hannes Androsch Prize (EUR 100,000 for 2011) for scientific contributions to its goals.

The current Shamrock building is a major landmark of Bendigo and is of historic and architectural significance to the nation of Australia as a significant building and to the state of Victoria as part of a significant streetscape and collection of late Victorian buildings in a similar style.  History  The Shamrock Hotel in 1864 The Shamrock began life in 1854, as a small hotel known as The Exchange Hotel, servicing miners during the Victorian gold rush including a Cobb and Co. office and a concert hall known as the Theatre Royal. The hotel's patronage had grown quickly with the booming goldfields and it was renamed the Shamrock in 1855. The same year the Theatre Royal hosted to Lola Montez, performing for the diggers who threw gold nuggets at her feet, many of which the Shamrock staff took as tips while cleaning. The Bendigo Shakespeare and Literary Society also performed at the theatre from 1861. Completely rebuilt in 1864, the Shamrock became a large hotel with two triple storey palazzo in the Victorian Regency architecture style. By this time the Shamrock had become main hotel in central Sandhurst (as Bendigo was then known) and was the accommodation of choice of visiting dignitaries to the valley's goldfields district including governor Charles Henry Darling. A large double storey verandah was added in the 1870s. The building In 1897 the hotel was once again completely rebuilt to the design of Phillip Kennedy, an understudy of German migrant architect Wilhelm C. Vahland, who is attributed to the four storey Second Empire architecture design with basement level and a distinctive tall fifth storey mansard roof. The elaborate \\"boom style\\" building features detailed stucco mouldings and a distinctively Australia feature in its Victorian Filigree styled double storey wrap around iron lacework verandah. The entry patio has the hotel's name in mosaic parquetry and the hotel's name is also etched into the glass of the transom light. Part of the ambitious brief was to construct a rival in grandeur to Melbourne's the Grand Hotel (now Windsor Hotel). The construction contractors were Baxter and Boyne. The Shamrock played a role in the History of Australia when in 1898 it hosted the Australian Natives' Association at the banquet hall in which Alfred Deakin made a speech in support for the Federation of Australia. Dame Nellie Melba was one of the notable guests of the hotel during the Edwardian era, she stayed in the third floor corner suite opposite the Bendigo Post Office clock tower and demanded its hourly chime be turned off. Other notable guests included Harry Lauder, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, John McCormack, Richard Strauss. =1970s demolition threat= In the 1970s the Shamrock, like many grand hotels around Australia, had waned in popularity and was under threat of demolition as one of several sites in being proposed for speculative office blocks. The Rupert Hamer government stepped in, acquiring the hotel for $240,000 to save it and nominated it of state heritage significance. =Restoration and reopening= Hotel Entry First floor parlour The Victorian Public Works Department subsequently undertook a major restoration project at a cost of approximately $2.5 million which was finally completed on 14 April 1981. While many historic interior features were intact including the grand staircase, verandah, second storey parlour, halls and arches and 1920s elevator most of the rooms were upgraded with modern facilities and the top storey beneath the mansard roof, which were subject to water ingress and pigeon roosting was boarded off and the basement level was closed. The hotel was leased to Clover Hotels. Among the high-profile guests after the reopening were Charles, Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales during a royal visit in 1983. The Shamrock is privately operated and part of the Comfort Inn brand until recently. It remains one of Bendigo's most popular venue for functions and photography, particularly wedding receptions. Heritage recognition The Shamrock was given a state interim heritage protection order in 1975. The hotel was recognised with national significance to Australia in 1978 when it was added to the Register of the National Estate (4298). It is currently recognised by Heritage Victoria as being of state heritage significance (H0914)http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/reports/report_place/133 and listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. The Shamrock is also classified by the National Trust of Victoria (B1853) as being of state significance.http://www.nattrust.com.au/trust_register/search_the_register/shamrock_hotel__1  References External links Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1897 Category:1897 establishments in Australia Category:Buildings and structures in Bendigo Category:Second Empire architecture in Australia Category:Hotels in Victoria (Australia) Category:Victorian Heritage Register Category:Pubs in Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Shamrock Hotel, Bendigo"},{"id":"26999636","text":"Pabo may refer to: Personal name *Pabo Post Prydain (fl. c. 500?), northern British king *Pabo, supposed founder of Llanbabo, Anglesey *Pabo, abbot of St. Emmeram's Abbey Geographic name *Pabbo, a town in northern Uganda *Pabo, Uttarakhand, a town in Uttarakhand state of India. *Pabo, a crater on Mars Music *Pabo, a Japanese female idol group created for the variety show Quiz!

Retrieved 18 April 2010. Biography=Early years Thomas Frost was born in Croydon in Surrey (now part of Greater London) on 16 December 1821, the son of a tailor who had read William Cobbett's Political Register and took part in the agitation to secure the Reform Act 1832. Apprenticed to a printer (his cousin Cornelius Chapman) in Norwood, London, Thomas started his own printing firm in the same town after Chapman's business became bankrupt.Frost, Thomas. Reminiscences of a Country Journalist. Covent Garden: Ward and Downey, 1888 Career In 1846 he took over the publication of John Goodwyn Barmby's Communist Chronicle, a monthly paper which had been discontinued for financial reasons. Frost revived the Chronicle as a weekly publication and reduced the price from 3d. to 1d. with Barmby retaining editorial control. Differences between Barmby and Frost on their aims caused publication to cease. Frost then started a short-lived Communist Journal. From 1847 to 1848 he was associated with the Fraternal Democrats. From 1859 Frost was a leader writer for the Liverpool Albion weekly newspaper, on foreign politics and social questions. The newspaper maintained a political viewpoint independent of the main political parties until 1872, when a new proprietor, a member of the Conservative Party, recast the paper as a morning daily. Frost's terms of employment were now changed so that he was only paid for articles that were published; he was contracted to provide two articles per week, but many were not published, being politically incompatible. His income falling by one-third he left the Albion. Frost subsequently settled in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, and worked as a reporter for the Barnsley Times and the Barnsley Chronicle. He wrote a number of books, mostly by his own admission \\"potboilers\\". He estimated his annual income from journalism and other literary undertakings to have been less than ¬£200 per year. He died in 1908. Frost claimed it was not until he read the poetry of Mary Shelley that he learned of \\"the connexion between the influence of circumstances in the formation of character and the new organization which Owen desired to give society\\". Frost became an active Chartist and Owenite and although he believed in revolution he stopped short of taking part in a revolutionary conspiracy to avoid arrest. He above all desired independence and wrote that \\"the assumption by Mr. Gladstone of the leadership of the Liberal party in the House of Commons seemed to promise the inauguration of a new era\\".E. F. Biagini, Liberty, Retrenchment and Reform. Popular Liberalism in the Age of Gladstone, 1860‚Äì1880 (Cambridge University Press, 1992), p. 385. Magic history Frost wrote three books on the history of magic. His Lives of the Conjurers (1876) is considered to be the first significant history of magic.Coleman, Earle Jerome. (1987). Magic: A Reference Guide. Greenwood Press. p. 6. \\"Thomas Frost' s The Lives of the Conjurors was the first book-length history of magic and is understandably required reading for the would-be historian of magic.\\" M.

Sulaymaniyah, a Kurdish city with a population of over 100,000, was the first Iraqi city to be captured by rebels and the last one to fall. The city was recaptured by Kurdish rebels, after the Peshmerga launched a new offensive on 20 July. Prelude Since the autonomy agreement collapsed in 1974, Kurds had been fighting an armed insurgency against Saddam's regime. After the Gulf War heavily damaged the Iraqi military and an uprising began in Southern Iraq, Jash (Kurdish militia used by Saddam Hussein's regime to fight Peshmerga) deserters, seized control of the city of Raniya with support of the local population. Many of the militia took sides with the Peshmerga. The revolutionary feeling spread to the rest of Kurdistan, where people took to the streets and Peshmerga entered the cities and seized control of Raniya, Chawar Qurna, Koi-Sanjaq, Sulaymaniya, Halabja, Arbat, Erbil, Dohuk, Zakho and Kirkuk. Uprising=Peshmerga offensive The uprising started on 7 March as lightly armed Peshmerga entered the city and ousted government forces. The Peshmerga were joined by local civilians, who took the streets and helped the Peshmerga launch a mass assault on all government buildings and detention centers, freeing hundreds of political prisoners. The last and biggest point of resistance by the Iraqi security forces was the heavily fortified Security Directorate. Ba'athist forces fought off the Kurds for over 2 hours, after which Kurdish Peshmerga and rioters entered the building; by 8 March, the entire city was under Peshmerga control. Many captured Ba'athists were torn to pieces, alive, by the angry crowds; others were burned or cut to pieces with saws. According to Human Rights Watch, an estimated 700 Ba'athists security personnel were killed in such executions by the people, but regular soldiers were mostly pardoned and allowed to return home. Government counter- offensive After the defeat of rebels in the south and the fall of all southern cities to Iraqi security forces, the Iraqi government turned north, where they deployed aircraft, heavy artillery and tanks to confront the Peshmerga. With food shortages and no international backing, the Peshmerga were outmanned and outgunned, with over three-quarters of the Iraqi army on the outskirts of Sulaymaniyah and 20,000 Peshmerga protecting the city. Heavy fighting occurred around the outskirts. The Peshmerga eventually retreated into central Sulaymaniyah after withstanding a ten-day assault by over 90,000 Iraqi troops supported by tanks and aircraft. Casualties were heavy on both sides. The outgunned Peshmerga lost 6,000 of their original strength of only 20,000, and because the Iraqi army lacked tactical training, they suffered dramatic casualties and lost nearly 17,000 troops. On 31 March, the government offensive against the city itself started. It began from the west and focused on the civilian neighborhoods of Bakhtiari and Rizjari. The district of Azadi was also hit by heavy shelling and by attacks from helicopters. On 1 April, the Peshmerga attacked Iraqi tanks from the hills overlooking Bakhtiari, destroying a quarter of the Iraqi army's tanks; but by 2 April the Peshmerga called on civilians to evacuate the town and flee north before the Iraqi forces entered. In a last attempt to hold the city, the Peshmerga launched the suicidal Shahid Mahmood offensive, in which they wiped out several lines of Iraqi infantrymen, and by the end of 2 April had successfully captured the Sannandj road. To avoid annihilation, the remaining Peshmerga retreated back to Mount Qandil. By 3 April, the military took control of the city, which had turned into a ghost town as all civilians had fled in fear of government reprisals. The city therefore also remained relatively intact, although suffered heavy looting from Iraqi soldiers. Aftermath After many Kurds had returned to their homes, in July the Peshmerga decided to confront the Iraqi Army again. On 20 July, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) Peshmerga launched a joint assault on the cities of Erbil, Dohuk and Sulaymaniyah. By October 1991, a cease-fire was signed, the government leaving the Peshmerga in control of some of Iraqi land. This area became a de facto Kurdish state within Iraq and was completely blockaded by Saddam Hussein and cut off from the rest of the country.

The nation experienced rapid development and the Emperor was intimately involved in pushing for further progress on a variety of economic and cultural fronts. It was during this period that serious efforts toward the end of slavery began to be implemented.  Apogee  The end of the Paraguayan War ushered in what is considered the \\"golden age\\" and apogee of the Brazilian Empire. In a \\"general way, the 1870s were prosperous for the nation and its monarch. It was a period of social and political progress where the distribution of national wealth began to benefit a greater part of the population.\\" Brazil's international reputation skyrocketed and, with the exception of the United States, was unequalled by any other American nation. Indeed, the \\"start of the 1870s brought prosperous times for Brazil. Its economy was booming, and schemes for internal development‚Äîrailroads, shipping lines, and immigrant colonies‚Äîproliferated. With slavery destined for extinction and other reforms projected, the prospects for 'moral and material advances' seemed vast.\\"  Racial thoughts and abolitionism  Few Brazilians opposed slavery around 1870, and even fewer were openly against it. But among its opponents was Pedro II. He \\"repudiated the enslaved manpower and he considered it a national shame.\\" The emperor never bought slaves. The only ones he owned (around forty) came from an inheritance he received when declared of age in 1840‚Äîat which point he immediately set them all free. Around this time he began looking for ways to abolish slavery, even if gradually. He affirmed in a letter: \\"Nobody desires the abolition more strongly than I do.\\" In a private conversation with Louis Agassiz he said: \\"Slavery is a terrible curse on any nation, and it must, and will, disappear among us [Brazilians].\\" He was supported by few, among them his sister Dona Francisca and his wife, Teresa Cristina. But \\"the emperor, who declared several times his intention to assume direction of the abolitionist movement, as expected, took too long to overcome the political obstacles.\\" The Afro- Brazilian C√¢ndido da Fonseca Galv√£o, friend of Emperor Pedro II. Pedro II was not a racist and manifested \\"great tolerance towards all his subjects, without exception, no matter their color or faith.\\" He also exhibited tolerance towards both Jews (when asked why there were no laws against them in the country, he answered: \\"I will not attack the Jews, as the God of my religion came from their people\\") and Muslims (affirming that a sincere reconciliation between the West and the East was necessary). The emperor never adopted ideas, common during the era, espousing racial inequality. According to historian Roderick J. Barman: > \\"During one of his visits to a night school in Rio, the Liceu de Artes e > Of√≠cios, the emperor learned that a freed slave was enrolled, learning how > to read, write and do arithmetic. 'When he entered the classroom, he went up > to him, clapping him on the shoulder, as a demonstration of his immense > satisfaction in seeing the way in which a man of the people was striving to > learn how to be useful to the country and his family.' Pedro II‚Äôs > commendable freedom from racial prejudice meant that he did not perceive > skin color as a bar to civilization or citizenship.\\" The abolition of slavery was a delicate subject in Brazil. Slaves were used by everyone, from the richest to the poorest. They worked as house servants, farmers, miners, prostitutes, and gardeners. Slavery was so widespread in the country that many former slaves owned slaves, and cases of slaves who had their own slaves were common. So strongly entrenched was this institution, that none of the rebellions which occurred during the regency in the 1830s advocated ending it. Even the Mal√™ Revolt had as a goal only the release of enslaved Muslims. To oppose slavery was seen as being counter to the national interest. Even so, the emperor did not give up. Pedro II despised slave dealers and refused to grant titles of nobility to any of them, including powerful and influential figures at court. He threatened to abdicate if the General Assembly (parliament) did not declare the traffic illegal, which was done in 1850. This was his first open move against slavery. As one source supplying new slaves had been eliminated, at the beginning of 1860s Pedro II turned his attention to eliminating the remaining source: the enslavement of children born to slaves. On his initiative, legislation was drafted by the Marquis of S√£o Vicente. The Paraguayan War, however, delayed discussion of the proposal by the General Assembly. Pedro II openly asked for the gradual eradication of slavery in the Speech from the Throne of 1867. He was heavily criticized (including by the republicans), and his move condemned as \\"national suicide.\\" The accusation was aired \\"that abolition was his personal desire and not that of the nation.\\" Eventually, the nomination of the abolitionist and conservative Viscount of Rio Branco as President of the Council of Ministers made possible the passage of the bill, which was enacted as the Law of Free Birth on 28 September 1871, under which all children born of slave women after that date would be considered free.

Background  It is not known when Zhang Gongsu was born. He was from Lulong Circuit's capital Fanyang (). As of the middle of Emperor Yizong's Xiantong era (860-874), Zhang Gonsu served as an officer in the Lulong army under the military governor Zhang Yunshen, eventually reaching the position of prefect of Ping Prefecture (Âπ≥Â∑û, in modern Qinhuangdao, Hebei).Old Book of Tang, vol. 180. Zhang Yunshen died in 872. Emperor Yizong initially commissioned Zhang Yunshen's son Zhang Jianhui as acting military governor. Zhang Gongsu, however, took his army from Ping Prefecture and headed for Lulong's capital prefecture You Prefecture (), to attend Zhang Yunshen's funeral. As the Lulong army soldiers respected Zhang Gongsu, Zhang Jianhui feared that Zhang Gongsu was ready to attack him, and therefore fled to the imperial capital Chang'an. Emperor Yizong then made Zhang Gongsu acting military governor, and later in the year made him full military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 252.  As military governor  In 873, when Emperor Yizong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Xizong, Emperor Xizong bestowed on several military governors, including Zhang Gongsu, the honorific chancellor title Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). It was said that Zhang Gongsu was violent and harsh as a military governor, and as his eyes showed much sclera, the people of the circuit referred to him as the \\"White-Eyed Chancellor.\\"New Book of Tang, vol. 212. In 875, the ethnically-Tujue officer Li Maoxun considered rebelling against him. At the time, the people of the circuit much respected the senior officer Chen Gongyan (), who was serving as the commander at Naxiang Base (Á¥çÈôçËªç, in modern Beijing). Li secretly assassinated Chen and took over his army, and then headed toward You Prefecture, claiming to be Chen's forward commander. Zhang Gongsu engaged him and was defeated, and thereafter fled to Chang'an. (Only after Li then entered You Prefecture did the people realize that he was not Chen, but felt compelled to support him anyway.) Emperor Xizong subsequently demoted Zhang to be the census officer at Fu Prefecture (Âæ©Â∑û, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). That was the last reference in history to Zhang's career, and it is not known when he died.

It is one of several railway stations to have served Hamilton, and one of three to be closed permanently. History The station was opened on 1 April 1878 as Greenfield, and was later renamed Burnbank.Butt (1995), page 109Butt (1995), page 48 The station closed on 1 January 1917, but re-opened again on 2 June 1919 along with others on the line (with the exception of Peacock Cross). Originally it was served by the Glasgow, Bothwell, Hamilton and Coatbridge Railway, and later, the North British Railway. Under the Railways Act 1921, the NBR became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) who continued to serve the line. Burnbank saw trains going to and from Hamilton. The LNER was nationalized under the Transport Act 1947 and became part of British Railways who also continued to serve the line until 1952. Just north of the station there was a spur to Burnbank goods depot. The station was again closed on 15 September 1952. Today No trace of Burnbank station remains. The remains of the trackbed and presumably the platforms were still visible in the 1980s, at which time the land was landscaped and houses built upon. However, while traces of the station are gone, the line's history still remains visible with old bridges still remaining in and around the area.
