Early life Harbrow was born in Cairns to an Indigenous Australian mother from Cairns and a Caucasian father from Mooroopna, Victoria. His indigenous ancestry can be traced to the Yirrganydji, a rainforest tribe in Far North Queensland.AFL Record. Round 9,2009. Slattery Publishing. pg 75. He grew up in the town of Cairns, in Queensland and began playing junior football with the Manunda Hawks and then the South Cairns in the AFL Cairns competition. He attended Woree State School while based in Cairns. When Harbrow was 13, his brother was rushed to the Townsville Hospital after being diagnosed with leukemia. As a result, Jarrod moved to Townsville with his family for one year and gave his brother bone marrow to survive leukemia. He continued to play junior football for the Hermit Park Tigers and attended Townsville Grammar School. In 2005, at the age of 16, Harbrow moved to country Victoria where he played for the Mooroopna Football Club before joining the TAC Cup side the Murray Bushrangers in a bid to nominate for the AFL Draft. He represented Queensland at both the 2004 AFL Under 16 Championships and 2006 AFL Under 18 Championships, both sides winning the respective division titles. He was overlooked in the 2006 AFL Draft, however had already attracted the attention of AFL talent scouts Peter Dean and Scott Clayton. AFL career Drafted as a rookie, Harbrow was picked up by the Bulldogs in the 2007 rookie draft. Following only a short time in development playing for the Bulldogs VFL affiliate Werribee, Harbrow was called up for his AFL debut against the Richmond Tigers in Round 4, 2007. He has since become a senior regular and impressed with his pace, skill, defensive pressure and evasive running abilities. In 2009, after struggling to get a game in the first few weeks of the season, he was thrown into defence against North Melbourne. Since then, he was often seen among the Bulldogs' best, became a regular senior player. He had many highlights in 2009 and shut down some of the league's best small forwards, including Matt Campbell, Stephen Milne, Brad Dick, and Mathew Stokes. At the conclusion of the 2010 season, the Bulldogs confirmed Jarrod would be the newest uncontracted player to join the Gold Coast Suns. Jarrod wasted no time with the announcement to the football world, coming just days after the Bulldogs' loss to St Kilda in the preliminary final. After being the subject of much speculation all year, the lure of returning home to Queensland proved too strong, despite the Bulldogs' best efforts to retain the rebounding damaging defender. Jarrod was the fifth uncontracted player from an AFL club to join the Suns. Jarrod played his 100th AFL game in Round 18, 2012 against . In round 7, 2016 he became the first Gold Coast player to play 100 AFL games.'Jarrod Harbrow the first Gold Coast Suns player to reach 100 games' - Courier Mail In round 19, 2018, Harbrow became the first Gold Coast player to play 150 games for the club. The club board ratified the decision to award him life membership.

The primary ingredients are whole black lentils (urad), red kidney beans (rajma), butter and cream. The dish gets its richness from the use of cream or butter, but it can also be prepared with yogurt, milk or no dairy. History Dal makhani served with rice Dal makhani is a staple in the Indian subcontinent. It was popularized in India following partition, when many people from Punjab migrated to the northern regions of India. As the Punjabi diaspora migrated across India and internationally, the dish was introduced to new locales by entrepreneurial Punjabi migrants Kundan Lal Gujral, Thakur Dass and Kundan Lal Jaggi at their restaurant called http://www.sunday-guardian.com/investigation/partition- brought-moti-mahal-a-landmark-in-indias-culinary-history-to-central-delhi Moti Mahal in the locality of Daryaganj, Delhi, India. Kundan Lal Jaggi is the inventor of dal makhani.https://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/punjab-on-a- platter/story-2e7rv1ngATLYLc2oEm4uBO.html This dish was first created by Punjabis and is now recognized as a quintessential Indian dish, and variations of the dish are served in many different restaurants internationally. Dal makhani's popularity is due in part to its versatility in a meal: the rich vegetarian dish can be served as a main meal, included as part of a buffet (thali), or used as an accompaniment to a meal. In India, soups and curries with a red or yellow lentil base are an important staple. Preparation time The traditional preparation of dal makhani involves a series of time-consuming procedures, which can take up to 24 hours to complete. With the availability of modern cooking equipment, namely pressure cookers, the preparation time of the dish has reduced significantly to 2‚Äì3 hours. The lentils, however, need to be soaked overnight or a minimum of 5-6 hours for the best flavor.

Founded in 1980 by Pim Levelt, it is the only institution in the world entirely dedicated to psycholinguistics, and is also one of only three among a total of 90 within the Max Planck Society to be located outside Germany. The Nijmegen-based institute currently occupies 5th position in the Ranking Web of World Research Centers among all Max Planck institutes (7th by size, 4th by visibility). It currently employs about 235 people. Research The institute specializes in language comprehension, language production, language acquisition, language and genetics, and the relation between language and cognition. Its mission is to undertake basic research into the psychological, social and biological foundations of language. The goal is to understand how human minds and brains process language, how language interacts with other aspects of mind, and how to learn languages of quite different types. The MPI for Psycholinguistics is a globally recognized center of linguistics and presents with its international archive of endangered languages a significant contribution to the preservation of the common heritage of mankind. This archive is sponsored since 2000 by the Volkswagen Foundation and offers on the internet about 50 projects. Departments The MPI for Psycholinguistics has six primary organizational units: Language and Cognition The Language and Cognition Department, headed by Stephen C. Levinson, investigates the relationship between language, culture and general cognition, making use of the \\"natural laboratory\\" of language variation. In this way, the department brings the perspective of language diversity to bear on a range of central problems in the language sciences. It maintains over a dozen field sites around the world, where languages are described (often for the first time), field experiments conducted and extended corpora of natural language usage collected. In addition, the department is characterized by a diversity of methods, ranging from linguistic analysis and ethnography to developmental perspectives, from psycholinguistic experimentation to conversation analysis, from corpus statistics to brain imaging, and from phylogenetics to linguistic data mining. Language and Genetics Established in October 2010, the Language and Genetics Department is headed by Simon E. Fisher. The department takes advantage of the latest innovations in molecular methods to discover how the human genome helps to build a language-ready brain. It aims to uncover the DNA variations which ultimately affect different facets of human communicative abilities, not only in children with language-related disorders but also in the general population. Crucially our work attempts to bridge the gaps between genes, brains, speech and language, by integrating molecular findings with data from other levels of analysis, including cell biology, experimental psychology and neuroimaging. In addition, it hopes to trace the evolutionary history and worldwide diversity of key genes, which may shed new light on language origins. Language Comprehension The Language Comprehension Department, headed by Anne Cutler, undertakes empirical investigation and computational modeling of the understanding of spoken language. Until 2009, the work within the department was largely divided between two research projects: decoding continuous speech and phonological learning for speech perception. From 2009 onwards, most of the work of the department goes into the project called Mechanisms and Representations in Comprehending Speech. This project focuses on core theoretical issues in speech comprehension such as on how episodic memories - such as hearing someone speak in an unfamiliar dialect - influence the speech perception system, or how is prior knowledge about one's language (phonotactic probabilities, lexical knowledge, frequent versus infrequent word combinations) used during perception. Language Acquisition While still under reorganization, the Language Acquisition Department until September 2012 investigated processes of language acquisition and use in a broad perspective. The department combined attention to both first and second languages, researching production as well as comprehension of speakers of different ages and cultures, and the developmental relationship between language and cognition. The focus was on morpho-syntax, semantics and discourse structure. Headed by Wolfgang Klein, Language Acquisition previously launched three institute projects, namely, Information Structure in Language Acquisition, Categories in Language and Cognition and Multimodal Interaction. The Language Acquisition Department has reopened in 2016 heading by Caroline Rowland. Neurobiology of Language The Neurobiology of Language Department, headed by Peter Hagoort, focuses on the study of language production, language comprehension, and language acquisition from a cognitive neuroscience perspective. This includes using neuroimaging, behavioral and virtual reality techniques to investigate the language system and its neural underpinnings. Research facilities at the Max Planck Institute include a high- density electroencephalography (EEG) lab, a virtual reality laboratory and several behavioral laboratories. Having a part of the department stationed at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging, it also has access to a whole-head 275 channel MEG system, MRI- scanners at 1.5, 3 and 7 Tesla, a TMS-lab, and several additional EEG laboratories. Psychology of Language The Psychology of Language Department, headed by Antje S. Meyer, identifies characteristics of the cognitive system that determine behavior in a broad range of linguistic tasks and the relationships between language production, comprehension, and learning via speaking, listening and cognition. The department also understands variability in adult language production and comprehension. Using various approaches, the Psychology of Language utilizes a combination of experimental and correlational work and inclusion of diverse samples of participants. With such methods, it has close links to the Language and Genetics and Neurobiology of Language departments. Independent Research Groups=Communication before Language This MPI research group, headed by Daniel Haun, investigates the social and cognitive foundations of human communication in infancy specifically on infants' developing social cognition and social motivation in relation to their emerging prelinguistic communication within social and cultural contexts. Their work is motivated by the idea that there is a psychological basis of human communication that develops ontogenetically prior to language and can be first expressed in gestures. Evolutionary Processes in Language and Culture Started in 2009, the research group investigates language diversity and change as part of an integrated cultural evolutionary system. Headed by Michael Dunn, the group takes a modern evolutionary perspective, using computational tools from genetics and biology, and integrating probabilistic, quantified approaches to phylogenetics with rigorous tests of different models of the interaction between elements of language, contact and geography, and cultural variation. Syntax, Typology and Information Structure The research group, headed by Robert D. Van Valin, Jr., tries to determine the role of information structure in explaining cross-linguistic differences in grammatical systems out of the idea that the interaction of pragmatics and grammar happens on several levels and differs from language to language. Another major task of the group is to investigate and re-evaluate the status of the information structure primitives (topic, focus, contrast, etc.) as cross-linguistically valid categories. To achieve this, the members of the group combine extensive corpus analysis of the data in their respective languages with production experiments; all findings are further cross-checked through standard information structure tests (question- answer pairs, aboutness tests, association with focus sensitive items).

Isabel was the sister of the famous James 2nd Earl of Douglas and Earl of Mar, who died leading the Scots to victory at the Battle of Otterburn. He died without any legitimate children and his sister Isabel inherited most of his property, excluding only the Douglas lands which could only pass through the male line. After being confirmed as countess she then became the most sought after bride in the realm and soon was married to Sir Malcolm Drummond, brother-in-law of King Robert III. This marriage however failed to produce any children and the Countess soon became the focus of several plots to usurp her lands by scheming nobleman. While the couple resided at the chief seat to the Earldom of Mar, Kildrummy Castle, Sir Malcolm was frequently away on royal business, being one of King Robert's close advisors. In 1402, while Sir Malcolm was away at one of his other castles, he was suddenly attacked by a large group of highlanders led by the infamous Alexander Stewart, illegitimate son of the Wolf of Badenoch. Alexander then proceeded to capture the castle and put Sir Malcolm into one of his dungeons where he soon died at the hands of his captor. Because the king was by this time sick and infirm and real power was in the hands of his younger brother the Duke of Albany, Isabel was now completely isolated and was now easy prey for her husband's murderer. In the summer of 1404, Alexander and his gang of highlanders descended on her castle of Kildrummy and captured it along with the Countess and was soon able to extort from her a signed document promising to marry Alexander and give over to him all of her lands, including the earldom of Mar and lordship of the Garioch. Under normal circumstances this incident possibly would not have been allowed to stand, but Isabel had the misfortune that these events took place during the regency of the Duke of Albany who was in fact the uncle of this Alexander Stewart. Because his relation to the Royal Family and friendship with his uncle saved him from any actual punishment, Isabel was forced to marry the man who murdered her husband and live the last four years of her life as a captive. She died in the year 1408 without children. The earldom of Mar then reverted to the crown and was later given to John Erskine, 6th Lord Erskine, whose descendants hold it to this day.

She has served on the High Court since 2007, having previously been a judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland and the Federal Court. Kiefel is the first woman to serve as Chief Justice.  Early life and education  Kiefel was born in Cairns, Queensland in 1954. She attended Sandgate District State High School, leaving at the age of 15 upon completing Year 10. In 1971, she completed secretarial training at Kangaroo Point Technical College on a scholarship. She worked as a secretary for a building society, an architect, and an exploration company before starting work as a receptionist for a group of barristers. During this time, she completed secondary school and began studying law. In 1973, Kiefel joined a firm of solicitors as a legal clerk. Completing her education at night, she enrolled in the Barristers Admission Board course and passed her course with honours. In 1984, while on sabbatical leave, she completed a Master of Laws (LLM) at the University of Cambridge, where she was awarded the C.J. Hamson Prize in Comparative Law and the Jennings Prize. In 2008, she was elected to an Honorary Fellowship of Wolfson College, Cambridge. She is a Life Fellow of the Australian Academy of Law. Career=Legal and judicial career Kiefel was admitted to the bar in 1975. She became an honorary secretary of the Queensland Bar Association in 1978 and served on its committee in 1993. She was appointed as the first female Queen's Counsel in Queensland in 1987 and was appointed to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in 1989. In May 1993, Kiefel was appointed to the Supreme Court of Queensland. The following year she was appointed by the Keating Government to the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island and was one of the first women to be appointed to the Federal Court of Australia on 17 October 1994, after Justice Deirdre O'Connor. In October 2001, Kiefel was appointed Deputy President of the Australian Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal and became its president in April 2004. In 2003, Kiefel was appointed as a part-time commissioner of the Australian Law Reform Commission, and was re-appointed for a further three years in 2006. In August 2009, Justice Kiefel was granted an Honorary Doctorate from Griffith University. Justice Kiefel was chosen to recognise her distinguished contributions to the legal profession and for leading the way for women in the industry. On 13 June 2011, she was named a Companion of the Order of Australia for eminent service to the law and to the judiciary, to law reform and to legal education in the areas of ethics, justice and governance. Appointment to the High Court On 13 August 2007, Attorney-General Philip Ruddock announced Kiefel as the nominee to the High Court of Australia to replace the retiring High Court Justice Ian Callinan. Kiefel had previously been considered a favourite nominee to replace former High Court Justice Mary Gaudron when she retired in 2003, and again in 2005 as replacement for Justice Michael McHugh. Kiefel is the third female High Court Justice and the forty sixth overall. Her appointment alongside incumbent Justice Susan Crennan marked the first time two women sat concurrently on the High Court bench. Kiefel's nomination was met with support from the Australian Bar Association amid criticism of the lack of consultation by the Australian government. She was considered a conservative \\"black-letter\\" judge. She may remain on the High Court until 2024, when she will reach the constitutionally mandatory retirement age of 70.. Chief Justice of Australia On 29 November 2016, the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the Attorney-General, George Brandis, announced the appointment of Kiefel as Chief Justice of Australia. The appointment took effect from 30 January 2017, following the retirement of Robert French. Kiefel is the first woman to be appointed as Chief Justice. Her seat on the court was filled by James Edelman. Giving the inaugural Lord Atkin Lecture in November 2017, Kiefel expressed her disapproval of the prevalence of judicial dissent, which she believes should be reserved for only the most important cases. She said law students should devote more attention to \\"mundane majority opinion\\", and described judges who frequently dissent as \\"somewhat self-indulgent\\". She further observed that \\"humorous dissent may provide the author with fleeting popularity, but it may harm the image the public has of the court and its judges\\". An article in May 2018 noted that Kiefel had dissented in only two out of 164 cases before the High Court since 2014, classing her as one of the court's \\"great assenters\\" along with Patrick Keane and Virginia Bell. She was notably one of three dissenters in Love v Commonwealth (2020), which found that Aboriginal Australians are not subject to the aliens power in section 51(xix) of the constitution. She stated that the majority had confused property rights with citizenship rights, and said that \\"race is irrelevant to the questions of citizenship and membership of the Australian body politic\\". In June 2020, Kiefel announced that the High Court had in 2019 commissioned an independent investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against her former colleague Dyson Heydon. The inquiry, led by Vivienne Thom, concluded that Heydon had sexually harassed six female associates. In a statement, Kiefel said that she had apologised to the women on behalf of the court and that it had adopted recommendations from the inquiry.  Personal life  While at Wolfson College, Kiefel met her future husband, Michael Albrecht, a social anthropologist, when she became a member of the college rowing crew and Albrecht was her coach.

It is also known as the Battle of Noddle's Island, Battle of Hog Island and the Battle of the Chelsea Estuary. This battle was fought on May 27 and 28, 1775, on Chelsea Creek and on salt marshes, mudflats, and islands of Boston Harbor, northeast of the Boston peninsula.In 1775, unlike today, Boston was a peninsula. Much land was filled around the Boston peninsula, primarily in the 19th century. See the history of Boston for details. Most of these areas have since been united with the mainland by land reclamation and are now part of East Boston, Chelsea, Winthrop, and Revere. The American colonists met their goal of strengthening the siege of Boston by removing livestock and hay on those islands from the reach of the British regulars. The British armed schooner Diana was also destroyed and its weaponry was appropriated by the Colonial side. This was the first naval capture of the war, and it was a significant boost to the morale of the Colonial forces. Background The Battle of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, drew thousands of militia forces from throughout New England to the towns surrounding Boston. These men remained in the area and their numbers grew, placing the British forces in Boston under siege when they blocked all land access to the peninsula. The British were still able to sail in supplies from Nova Scotia, Providence, and other places because the harbor side of the city remained under British naval control.McKay Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the naval supremacy of the British fleet and the complete absence of a Continental Navy in the spring of 1775.Callo, pp. 22-23\\\\. Formal naval organization did not begin until Washington took command in June 1775. However, there was one remaining local area that continued to supply the British forces in Boston after the war began. Farmers to the east of the city in coastal areas and on the Boston Harbor islands found themselves vulnerable once the siege began because they were exposed to British influence from the sea. If they continued to sell livestock to the regulars they would be viewed as Loyalists in the eyes of the Patriots, but if they refused to sell then the British would consider them rebels and raiding parties would simply take what they wanted. On May 14, the Massachusetts Committee of Safety under Joseph Warren issued the following order: A few days before the battle, Warren and General Artemas Ward, commander of the besieging forces, inspected Noddle's Island and Hog Island, which lay to the northeast of Boston, and east of Charlestown. They found no British troops there but plenty of livestock. The animals in other coastal areas had been moved inland by their owners. On May 21, the British had sailed troops to Grape Island in the outer harbor near Weymouth to get hay and livestock, and had been driven off by militia mustered from the nearby towns, which then removed the livestock and burned the hay on the island.Frothingham, p. 108 The British Navy around occupied Boston was under the command of Vice- Admiral Samuel Graves. The Royal Marines were under the command of Major John Pitcairn. The British forces as a whole were led by Governor General Thomas Gage.Beatson, p. 61 Graves had, in addition to hay and livestock, hired storage on Noddle's Island for a variety of important naval supplies, which he felt were important to preserve, owing to the \\"almost impossibility of replacing them at this Juncture.\\"Nelson, p. 18 there were 90 men of british there and 300 of bostonions Prelude to battle Colonel John Stark led the Colonial expedition. Vice-Admiral Graves, apparently acting on intelligence that the Colonials might make attempts on the islands, posted guard boats near Noddle's Island. These were longboats that included detachments of Marines. Sources disagree as to whether or not any regulars or marines were stationed on Noddle's Island to protect the naval supplies.Nelson, p. 18 claims that no troops were stationed on Noddle's. Ketchum, p. 69, implies as much. A Documentary History of Chelsea states (in testimony from British General Charles Sumner) that marines were present on the island. The \\"regiment now at Medford\\" mentioned by the Committee of Safety was Colonel John Stark's 1st New Hampshire Regiment of about 300 men stationed near Winter Hill with its headquarters in Medford.A Documentary History of Chelsea, pp. 442-443 Taking his instructions from General Ward, Stark and his regiment crossed the bridge over the Mystic River just after midnight on May 27. Their route took them far to the north of Chelsea Creek through Malden and parts of what are now the cities of Everett and Revere. Additional local men most likely joined them during their march. Hog Island was accessible at low tide from the east by fording Belle Isle Creek near the current location of Belle Isle Marsh Reservation. This crossing was effected without Graves' guard boats taking notice. Stark began to move his force to Hog Island at about 10 am and directed most of his men to round up livestock there while he forded Crooked Creek to Noddle's Island with a group of thirty men. Stark's small contingent on Noddle's Island scattered into small groups, killed the animals they could find, and set fire to haystacks and barns. Battle=Islands The British first took notice when they spotted the smoke from the burning hay. Vice-Admiral Graves on his flagship, , saw smoke from the burning hay at about 2 pm, and signaled for the guard marines to land on Noddle's island, which they did, engaging Stark's scattered forces. Graves also ordered the schooner Diana, under the command of his nephew Lieutenant Thomas Graves, to sail up Chelsea Creek to support the operation and cut off the colonists' escape. Eventually, a combined force of roughly 400 marines was landed, formed ranks and began to systematically drive Stark's men back to the east. The colonists fled without fighting until they reached Crooked Creek. There they dropped into marshy ditches and fired on their pursuers from strong defensive positions. A pitched battle followed, in which the colonists \\"Squat[t]ed down in a Ditch on the ma[r]sh\\" and engaged in \\"a hot fiar until the Regulars retreated\\".Ketchum, p. 69 (spelling in original) The Marines withdrew from their positions to the interior of Noddle's Island, and Stark's men left Crooked Creek to join the main body of his forces on Hog Island. Diana and the other vessels continued northeast up Chelsea Creek in pursuit. By sunset, hundreds of cattle, sheep, and horses had been driven from Hog Island to the mainland. Also around sunset, Diana turned about in an attempt to avoid being trapped in the shallows of the creek. However, Lieutenant Graves realized he would require assistance, and raised a signal. Vice-Admiral Graves ordered barges manned by marines into the creek to tow Diana out, along with the sloop Britannia, tender of (under the command of another of Graves nephews, Lieutenant John Graves) to assist and provide additional firepower. Sources disagree on the timing of the dispatching of the various vessels. A number of sources (Frothingham and A Documentary History of Chelsea among them) claim that Diana, Britannia, and the barges were all dispatched together;Frothingham, p. 109A Documentary History of Chelsea, p. 443 Nelson and Ketchum, possibly on the basis of more recent research, claim the account as told above.Nelson, p. 19 Thomas Graves, who commanded Diana, went on to become an admiral in the Royal Navy. Mainland coast Some of Stark's men were engaged in driving the livestock further up the coast. Others noticed that Diana was in trouble, and called for reinforcements. General Putnam and as many as 1000 troops (including Joseph Warren) came up on the shore near Diana, a place at the mouth of Chelsea Creek, in the modern Chelsea neighborhood by the McArdle bridge to East Boston.Kales, p. 88 Putnam waded out into the harbor up to his waist and offered quarter to the sailors of Diana if they would surrender, but its cannon continued to fire, and attempts to tow her into deeper water continued. Colonial forces continued firing on the ship, supported by two field pieces positioned on the shore. Britannia and field pieces the British had landed on Noddle's Island also joined the cannonade.Ketchum, p. 72 At about 10 pm, the British rowers were forced to abandon the rescue of Diana due to the heavy fire. Diana drifted and ran aground again on the Mystic River side of the Chelsea coast, tipping onto one side. Lieutenant Graves abandoned Diana and transferred his men to Britannia, which was successfully towed to deeper water. American forces boarded Diana and rapidly removed everything of value, including guns, rigging, sails, clothing, and money. They laid hay under the stern to serve as kindling, and the vessel was set on fire at about 3 am to prevent it from falling back into British hands.A Documentary History of Chelsea, p. 438 The guns recovered were probably used in the American positions during the Battle of Bunker Hill.Ketchum, p. 91 Aftermath This skirmish was apparently the first use of field pieces by the Colonists in the American Revolution. They suffered no fatalities, with only a small number of wounded, and their morale was greatly boosted by the successful capture and destruction of Diana. The action was also a boost to Israel Putnam, whose appointment by the Second Continental Congress as a General in the Continental Army was unanimously approved, in part due to reports of this skirmish.A Documentary History of Chelsea, p. 437 General Gage was understated in his casualty report to London: \\"Two men were killed and a few wounded.\\" Others, however, apparently exaggerated, reporting large casualties. The Pennsylvania Journal reported on June 21, 1775, that General Gage himself recorded at least one hundred killed while other sources said more than three hundred. From another source: \\"The regulars were said to have suffered very much, not to have had less than two hundred killed and wounded. The loss was probably greatly exaggerated; that, however, had a good effect on the provincials. The affair was a matter of no small triumph to them and they felt upon the occasion more courageous than ever.\\" Gage ordered cannon mounted on Copp's Hill in Boston, and Vice-Admiral Graves moved the Somerset, which had been stationed in the shallow waters between Boston and Charlestown, into deeper waters to the east of Boston, where it would have improved maneuverability if fired upon from land. He also belatedly sent a detachment of regulars to secure Noddle's Island; the Colonists had long before removed or destroyed anything of value on the island.Morrissey, p. 50 A satellite image of East Boston. The narrow neck visible in the upper left is Chelsea Creek, the boundary between Chelsea and Noddle's and Hog Island. The boundary between Hog Island and the mainland is just out of shot to the upper center. The former boundary between Hog Island and Noddles Island is roughly where the current Constitution Beach is just northwest of the airport Geographic changes In the years since the American Revolution, the geography of the Boston area has undergone significant expansion, and the islands named Hog and Noddle's are no longer islands. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the channel that separated Noddle's and Hog was filled in,Seasholes, p. 367 and that between Hog Island and the mainland was filled in over the course of the late 19th century and early 20th century leaving just a small, narrow creek between the former islands and the mainland.Seasholes, pp. 364, 379 In terms of modern geography, the Orient Heights neighborhood of East Boston is the present location of Hog Island and nearby Breeds Island,Register of Old Suffolk Chapter, p. 24 and much of the remainder of East Boston is what was then Noddle's Island.Shurtleff, p. 440 The Chelsea Creek has been narrowed due to the expansion of Chelsea and has been dredged and straightened to create a deep shipping channel. While occasional attempts have been made to locate the remains of the Diana in Chelsea Creek, which has been extensively dredged and industrialized in the years since the battle, no wrecks found in that body have been identified as hers. In 2009, the National Park Service gave funds for a state-led effort to locate the wreck.LeBlanc (2009) NotesReferences     * * Further reading *The above-cited Documentary History of Chelsea, in addition to the analysis and recounting of this action based on reliable accounts, contains in an appendix a variety of first-person accounts that vary considerably in their quality and reliability. * This bound periodical contains an account of the action.

Lamb created among the first animated surfing and skateboarding cartoons, and perhaps the first American animated, rotoscoped music video. In 1979, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented Lamb with an Academy Award for Scientific and Technical Achievement for co-invention of the Lyon Lamb Video Animation System (VAS). In the early 1970s, Lamb's animation was seen in two seminal surf movies. The Forgotten Island of Santosha by Larry and Roger Yates featured Lamb's first animated film Secret Spot (1974),https://www.surfertoday.com/surf-movies/forgotten-island-of-santosha while Five Summer Stories by McGillivray-Freeman Films (1975) featured Lamb's animated short Rocket 88. Secret Spot introduced Lamb's trademark character Willy Makitt. Notable for another first, Secret Spot features an \\"air\\" maneuver where the surfer flies out of the wave into the air and lands back on the wave to continue surfing - a trick now standard in the world surf community. Rocket 88 also features Willie Makitt doing a \\"shuvit\\" maneuver, which would later become a standard trick among skateboarders. The \\"shuvit\\" maneuver shows Willy Makitt kick-flipping the surfboard, causing it to spin - he then lands it to continue the ride. In 1975, Willy Makitt was licensed by Hang Ten and featured on their fiberglass skateboards, which can be seen in an NBC newscast on the \\"new\\" skateboarding phenomenon.Vintage Skateboard News Clip- 1975 Most recently, Lamb and Secret Spot were honored by the California Surf Museum in Oceanside, CA with a permanent installation. Hand painted by Lamb, with a bigger-than-life wave scene and classic hot rod, tikis, palm trees and jungle scene, the iconic Willy Makitt is featured at the peak of the giant wave. The Secret Spot installation plays host to art openings, premieres and surf extravaganzas of all types at the groundbreaking museum. The installation also features the work of Brett Hazzard, who created the \\"footprints in the sand\\" and breathtaking beach effect, that completes the installation's unique experience. See the mural's start and sky-bending finish on YouTube.Secret Spot at the California Surf Museum History With the fresh success of the Lyon Lamb Video Animation System in 1976, Lamb set out for his most ambitious animation project: Tom Waits for No One, featuring Tom Waits singing \\"The One That Got Away\\" from his LP Small Change. Using the newly invented Lyon Lamb Video Rotoscope, Lamb animated live footage of Tom Waits, creating what appears to be the first American, rotoscoped, animated rock video. Released in 1979, and largely hidden from the public eye since, the video would eventually see a second life when it went viral on YouTube almost 30 years later. In 1979, Lamb was honored with an Academy Award for Scientific and Technical Achievement for co-inventing the Lyon Lamb Video Animation System (VAS) - (shared with Bruce Lyon). The VAS is a single frame video device for pre-testing animation drawings before they are committed to film for final production.https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000003/1980 With the invention of the Lyon Lamb VAS, an animation revolution began. One example, a master animator uses the VAS to demonstrate a human \\"walk cycle\\" for his students.Animation Project #4 The Walk Cycle Companies Lamb is the founder several ventures in widely varied fields, including animation, graphic design, clothing design, licensed apparel, public murals, and most recently his \\"Blast from the Past\\" images rendered on aluminum. After leaving Lyon Lamb, throughout the 1980s and early '90s, John Lamb Productions merchandised and licensed Lamb's cartoon-style drawings. During that same period, Lamb also designed apparel for international companies Adidas, Nike, L.A.Gear, Puma, Body Glove, Bugle Boy, Jimmy Z, Maui and Sons, Hang Ten and Bear Surfboards, among others. In the late '90s, Lamb co-founded Bobtown Ink, with veteran Disney director Russ Mooney, producer Brian Ray and award-winning director John Kafka. They produced and created many original content shows for clients such as Disney, Universal, Nickelodeon, Sun Woo, Hanna Barbara, Cartoon Network, MGM, and Sony. Lamb continues his medium bending ways with \\"Blast from the Past\\", a series of post-war California-style images of hot rods, surfboards, classic cars and beach scenes set against the backdrop of one of America's most conspicuous images: the atomic plume. Printed on the same type of material from which the Enola Gay was made, the images represent a wistfully ironic commentary of life after the A-bomb.

The central reservation was meant for eventual lanes for traffic from Brussels to Antwerp (and vice versa), with only ramps in Mechelen (which explains the complex interchange in Mechelen-North and South). Only between Antwerp and Kontich, the middle lanes were built with 2 x 2 lanes, but these were merged in 2011. The rest of the track was not built in spite of the increased traffic. Because the Brussels Ring and Antwerp Ring can already no longer manage the traffic at certain times, the \\"super motorway\\" would do nothing but move the traffic jams from the A1 to the interchanges near Antwerp and Brussels. This broad central reservation, including the unnecessarily long bridges over the A1, along with the partly unused interchange in Mechelen and the lamps that light the unused central reservation, is an urban planning blunder. The unused lamps were taken out in 2006. Shortly after the Dutroux affair, in 1997, trees have been planted on a part of the central reservation in commemoration of killed children, the so-called \\"Witte Kinderbos\\" (\\"White Children's Forest\\"). On the central reservation between Zemst and Brussels, a railway has been built between 2007 and 2012 that is part of the new high-speed connection from Antwerp to Brussels Airport, known as the Diabolo project. Thereby, a part of the Witte Kinderbos disappeared and was replaced by green spaces between the A1 and the adjacent residential areas. The biggest part of the forest is between Mechelen and Antwerp and remained.

Hancocks laid out a 'Swiss' style village on the Estate near the hamlet of Drakelow. This village was home to around 50 families; Blakeshall Common School being built in 1855 to serve around 72 children from the village, the nearby rock houses and the local area. In the 1890s the school became a mission chapel for a non-denominational society. The mission left in 1898 but the building remained in used for occasional chapel and church purposes until the 1920s when the Hall and Estate were sold to the Grazebrook family. During the Second World War, the village site became part of the Drakelow Tunnels shadow factory, later developed during the Cold War as a fall-back government centre.

The VAOC was formed in December 1941 to support the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) with its main roles of sighting and observing aircraft over Australia. The VAOC swiftly established thousands of Observation Posts (OP) across the country and provided information to the RAAF's regional air control posts. As the threat to Australia on the home front declined the VAOC's role was expanded to include coast watching, assisting air traffic control, weather reporting and fire spotting. The VAOC was staffed by civilian volunteers and reached an estimated peak strength in 1944 of about 24 000 personnel and 2 656 Observation Posts. After the end of the war, the VAOC was reduced to a cadre in December 1945 and was disbanded on 10 April 1946. Many RAAF Officers had been to Britain before the War and the VAOC was modelled on their successful the Royal Observer Corps.  Lead up to war  The total Australian coastline is some 60000 km long and littered with no less than 8222 minor islands making it very vulnerable to attack from every point of the compass. The surprise attack on the US Fleet at Pearl Harbour with the simultaneous and rapid advancement of the Japanese Imperial Army across the South Pacific in late 1941 was a shock to Australian citizens.  The urgent need for observers  The Federal Government appointed the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as responsible for developing an effective early warning system against attack. Prior to the War, the RAAF was small enough for all its elements to be directly controlled by Headquarters based in Melbourne with its main base at Point Cook. The Southern Area Command was one of several geographically based subdivisions raised during WW2. Planning had commenced earlier but on Christmas Day 1941 the serving members of the Australian Air Board met to examine the current war situation. They sent a signal later that day instructing that the Volunteer Air Observers Corp (VAOC) was to be urgently organised with the objective of establishing Observation Posts (OP) manned by civilian volunteers. The VAOC were to maintain a 24-hour watch along the coast from Cairns in Queensland to Ceduna in South Australia and from Albany to Geraldton in Western Australia with rings of observations posts at a radius of 50 miles and 100 miles around Townsville, Brisbane, Newcastle, Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart, Adelaide and Perth. The coastal strips, each with a network of Observation Posts (OP) reporting to their own Zone Control Post would act as early warning and relay sightings of aircraft to a central State Control room in each Capitol city. The State control room was intended to have knowledge and oversight of all aircraft movement and notify fighter aircraft to intercept where necessary. Observation Posts along the coast were also required to report shipping and submarine sightings as well as provide weather reports twice daily for the RAAF. The model adopted drew from the British experiences of the Royal Observer Corps which was established some years earlier and proved very effective during the Battle of Britain in 1940.  Rapid establishment of an early warning system  There was every expectation that Australia would also be subject to air-raids of the intensity endured by Britain during the Blitz. By the time Darwin was bombed the VAOC was not yet operational, but by the time of the Japanese raids on Queensland targets like Cairns, Rockhampton and Townsville in 1942 thousands of VAOC volunteers were in place. These were in addition to Australian military Coastwatchers on small islands. Australia had few fighters capable of intercepting the Japanese early in the war and the USAAF did not arrive until about March 1942. In 1941 many Australians had never seen an aircraft or at least not close up. So the rapid establishment of a nationwide grid of Observation Posts involving thousands of civilian volunteers often in remote areas who needed to be enlisted and trained to recognise, identify and report and describe the activity of aircraft in flight was an outstanding achievement. The system was dependent on a dependable communications network, something that did not exist at the time. In 1941 the rudimentary telephone line operated by the Post Masters General (PMG) reached into population areas like major cities but not the outback or many areas of remote coast. Alternatives such as pedal radios and even carrier pigeons were considered. The result was the \\"AirFlash\\" priority call system where the telephone exchange operator would clear all calls and connect the Observation Post the Zone Control. Predictably this caused some angst on a grand scale with normal telephone subscribers on shared party lines. The very first Operational Post opened at Bairnsdale in Victoria on 26 December 1941, one day after the decision of the Air Board to operate a volunteer corp. Bairnsdale was already a busy RAAF operational training airfield at the time. The remainder of the Bairnsdale Zone was operational a few weeks later on 17 February 1942. In Melbourne, the Preston Town Hall was commandeered while rooms under Sydney cricket grounds and part of the University of Western Australia were pressed into service as State Control Centres. Hobart football ground and the Brisbane town hall were all used as State Sector Commands. These were operated by WAAAF personnel but by 1943 VAOC Observers would take over with RAAF liaison Officers. The State Zone Commanders were also civilians. The VAOC personal posted to Air Sector Victoria at Preston Town Hall reached nearly 350 by the wars end. There would have been similar number in all the other capital cities. In Australian airspace by late 1943 there were thousands of aircraft movement every day with the combined USAAF and RAAF flights as well as civilian and commercial flights. All of this was tracked and plotted manually with the assistance of the VAOC in the field recording the numbers and aircraft type, speed, elevation and their direction. Flights could last several hours and transit two or more States and were tracked across borders. The air observers were unable to make direct contact with aircraft by radio but sometimes signalled using lights and lanterns. Radar was in its infancy in Australia.  Recruitment  Sufficient information was released to the media to encourage community members to attend meetings to hear of the VAOC. It was made clear that even though they were volunteers the commitment was for the duration of the War. Much of the work fell to Squadron Leader J. V. Gray who travelled extensively to not only establish the network but recruit and support the VAOC volunteers. The RAAF also approached universities and high schools to seek new recruits. One success was the tower at Clyde School for Girls at Woodend, now Braemar College. Technical schools were recruited to make scale models of aircraft for teaching and identification purposes. Training films were produced. Local councils played an important role in coordination with the townsfolk, identifying good Observation Post sites and often supplying facilities. Shortage of equipment such as binoculars was a perennial problem and owners were required to declare them to the Government under a National Security Order. Most of the cost of maintaining the Observation Posts fell to the volunteers. Significantly, the volunteers were mostly women from rural areas.  Structure and operation  By May 1942 the VAOC was controlled by the Directorate of Pursuit, Fighter Sector Headquarters of Allied Command. There were four levels of the VAOC structure (2656 Observation Posts, 39 regional Zone Controls, 6 State Air Sectors based in each capitol city and the RAAF Air Defence HQ in Brisbane). A system that failed from time to time. In addition to permanent Observation Post (OP), there were a number of Reporting Posts (RP) on a station homestead or farm house where the occupant devoted as much time as they were able to the task of reporting aircraft movements. Sometimes mobile Air Reporting Officers (AROs) were utilised if they had access to telephone lines. Each VAOC spotter had their own unique Code Name. Volunteers in Observation Posts reported aircraft movements to a Zone Control situated in a regional city or town. There were 39 Zone Controls centres across the Australia with differing numbers in each state depending on its size. For the southern State of Victoria they were at eight Control Zones based at Melbourne, Bairnsdale, Geelong, Warnambool, Shepparton, Bendigo, Ballarat with another at Launceston in northern Tasmania. The State of Queensland had five Zone Controls and over 100 Observation Posts. Each Zone Control reported up the line to the State Air Sector based in each of the six the Capitol Cities. The Air Sector personnel provided liaison with all the Australian armed services, the USAAF, Fighter Command as well as other adjacent States when monitoring flights across borders. In Victoria, the VAOC were under Commanding Officer Flight Lieutenant C.W. Hyland, with Pilot Officer B.A. Clark as his Adjutant. They were based at the National Herbarium in the Botanical Gardens in Melbourne while the State Air Sector was situated at the Preston Town hall. Each state Air Sector reported directly to RAAF Air Defence HQ which from 1942 was located in the Brisbane's AMP building where General Douglas MacArthur had his General Headquarters. The building was renamed after the war as MacArthur Chambers. Some Observation Posts were very busy, depending on their location. The one at Wamberal on the NSW coast near Gosford recorded 38,476 aircraft of 80 different types over a three-year period to February 1945. They has also provided support and assistance to four aircraft in distress. Those near busy training fields as well as those along important travel routes such as from Fisherman'd Bend aircraft factory at Melbourne to Darwin logged many delivery flights.  Volunteer identification  The VAOC operated under the command of the RAAF as an auxiliary arm but unlike the Royal Observer Corp in Britain members of Australia's Volunteer Air Observer Corp were not required to wear a uniform. They only received a blue armband and later a small blue lapel pin for identification. Also, responsibilities for keeping records of volunteer service rested with the VAOC and not the RAAF and as a result the records were patchy. This oversight had ramifications after the war for volunteers seeking recognition of their efforts. By 1944 personnel at State Air Sectors eventually received a uniform of a beige coverall and beret for the women and an unglamorous boilersuit for the few men. Observation Posts were secret and with limit access.  Observation Post (OP) facilities  Not all Observation Posts required elevation to obtain a clear 360-degree field of view, particularly on the great plains of rural Australia. Some were discarded buses, rail carriages. Some were hotel buildings and private rooftops, some operated from purpose-built concrete bunkers like the one that remains on the hill overlooking Anglesea. Town halls and other public buildings were rented in large numbers by the RAAF. Some were elaborate structures constructed by whatever was at hand, often with donated materials and funds. Observation Posts often coexisted with existing State forestry authority fire towers. For example, in Western Australia, Observation Posts sat on top of the Forests Department giant fire lookout tree such as the Gloucester Tree. The VAOC naturally assisted with bushfire spotting and fire communications. Facilities such as a camp stretcher for night shifts, kerosene heaters, cooking facilities, toilets, shelter from the elements, water and power were often sparse and often provided by the volunteers or their local community. Other than a phone, clock, binoculars, aircraft identification silhouette cards, log book, a table and two chairs the RAAF did not supply comforts, nor payments for transport or any food allowances.  Training  Training required skills in aircraft identification, radio use, Morse code, map reading, weather reporting. All this had to be achieved rapidly for volunteers who in many cases have never seen a real aircraft before, at least not close up. The demand for scale models and silhouette identification cards for the increasing types of aircraft that flew the skies particularly after the USAAF arrived in great numbers could not keep up. State and national recognition competitions where prizes were awarded were popular to hone skills.  Submarine incursions  The fear of attack was real. Only weeks after the Fall of Singapore in 1942 an Air Observer at the Forests Commission's fire tower on Mount Raymond near Orbost reported the Imperial Japanese Navy I-25 submarine on the surface near the mouth of the Snowy River at Marlo. Forests Commission crews from Bruthen also identified markings on a remote beach consistent with a small boat being hauled ashore. Then on 26 February 1942, the same submarine launched a small float plane from near King Island in Bass Strait. The two-seater Yokosuka E14Y or Glen could be quickly broken down into 12 components for storage in the hangar of the submarine. It could also be rapidly assembled ready to fly in 12 to 30 minutes. The aircraft was piloted by Nobuo Fujita and observer Shoji Okuda and they made an audacious reconnaissance flight over Melbourne's suburbs and Port Phillip Bay. The incursion was detected and reported by no less than seven VAOC localities including Williamstown, Fisherman's Bend, Footscray, Melbourne City, South Melbourne, Mordialloc and Frankston. It even flew over anti-aircraft battery at Williamstown and despite seeking approval from higher authorities they never fired a shot. It's also often reported that Fujita made another clandestine flight over the VAOC Foster Observation Post (situated at the Golf Club) and Wonthaggi on 20 February 1942 through to the LaTrobe Valley power stations. His objective was to identify potential bombing targets. The submarine Japanese submarine I-25 then quietly slipped away to Hobart and then to Wellington in New Zealand for its next missions, and the whole incident remained a secret. The well-known attack on Sydney Harbour by Japanese midget submarines launched from the larger I-25 on 31 May 1942 followed an earlier reconnaissance flight by Fujita on 17 February. Several months later on 9 September 1942, Fujita dropped two incendiary bombs on America with the intention of starting a forest fire which was known as the Lookout Air Raid. However, the efforts of a US Forest Service patrol of fire lookouts and weather conditions not amenable to a fire and the damage by the attack was minor.The Journal of military history, Volume 53, p. 172. Virginia Military Institute, American Military Institute, George C. Marshall Foundation, 1989 The attack was the first time the contiguous United States was bombed by an enemy aircraft. Probably the most significant incursion of a Japanese submarine in Australian waters occurred off Brisbane with the sinking of the hospital ship Centaur on 14 May 1943.  Search and rescue  Because of the nature of their work following the movements of allied aircraft VAOC members were often the first to know about forced landings and crashes. Notable among them was Bob Hope and his entourage of American entertainers that made an unexpected landing on the Camden Haven River in Laurieton in August 1944. VAOC volunteers were there to rescue them from their stranded Catalina Flying Boat.  Demobilisation and recognition  Each 24-hour Observation Post ideally required about 100 observers to cover all the daily and night shifts. Records of volunteers were poorly kept and estimates range from 24000 to nearly 220000 people were involved at all levels by its peak in 1944. Volunteers worked across at all levels of the organisation from the 2656 Observation Posts, 39 Zone Controls through to six Air Sectors in the capital cities. After the end of the war, the VAOC was reduced to a cadre in December 1945 and was disbanded on 10 April 1946. The true scope of the VAOC was never revealed to the Australian public and the organisation was hastily dismantled by the RAAF at the conclusion of the war. Little trace remained and the service of volunteers remained unrecognised by military authorities. The Volunteer Air Observers received a small blue lapel pin and a certificate of recognition and quietly went back to their lives leaving their amazing stories largely untold. Of the thousands of VAOC Observation Posts there are only a few small memorials at Tallangatta, Lorne and Anglesea in Victoria, Wamberal near Gosford in NSW, Cleve in SA and Horn Island off Cape York in Queensland. In August 2020, the Victorian government announced that the Loveridge Lookout at Anglesea had been added to the Victorian Heritage Register, as one of the only two known remaining VAOC observation posts in Victoria.

It is situated close to the River Teme and the village of Leigh. It is on the primary route between Worcester and Hereford, the A4103 that runs through the centre of the village. According to the 2011 census, Bransford has a population of 389. The parish shares its parish council with Leigh. The main church in Bransford is St. Johns the Baptist church, a small Norman building, lit by candlelight. Bransford is part of the West Worcestershire parliamentary constituency and its current Member of Parliament is Harriet Baldwin, who is a Conservative representative.  History  thumb The origins of the name 'Bransford' are uncertain, but it is believed to mean 'hill-top ford' or 'ford at Bragen'. This is derived from 'braegen', old English for crown of the head or topographically a hill and then 'ford'. In the Doomsday Book, Bransford was called Bradnesforde and included information about Urso from the Pershore Church and mill. Bransford was home to Wulstan de Bransford, the Bishop of Worcester from 1338‚Äì49. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 Bransford Parish ceased to be responsible for maintaining the poor in its parish, a responsibility transferred to Martley Poor Law Union.Worcestershire Family History Guidebook, Vanessa Morgan, 2011, p68 The History Press, Stroud, Gloucestershire. In the 1870s, Bransford was described as > \\"...a chapelry in Leigh parish, Worcestershire; on the river Teme, adjacent > to the Malvern railway, 4¬Ω miles SW by W of Worcester.\\"  Occupation  leftIt was in 1894 that Bransford was separated from Leigh as an ecclesiastical parish and made into a civil parish of its own right. Bransford was once devoted to pasture and had 2,366 acres of arable land as well as a further 1,062 separate acres of land. There was once a clothing factory by the Teme, explaining why 7 women worked in dress in 1881. There was also a snuff-mill, which then became a corn-mill. When the clothing factory and snuff-mill disappeared, people became involved heavily in agriculture, which explains why in 1881 at least 46 people were engaged in agriculture as their occupation. It was at this time that men were involved in agriculture, whilst women were working in occupations such as domestic services (12 women) and dress services (4 women). Ninety women that lived in Bransford had an unspecified occupation, which was representative of the time. Today, there are 186 residents in employment. 8 people now work in agriculture, compared to 46 in 1881. Wholesale and retail trade now has the highest level of works in Bransford, with 35 people (18.8% of employment) working in this field. Human health and social work has the second highest level of employment in Bransford with jobs in education being third highest. This shows a huge change from 1881 where the majority of jobs were in agriculture, mining and domestic services.  Population and Age  thumbThe population of Bransford has steadily increased since 1881. There was a slight decrease in 1891 but then it continued to increase until 1911. In 1911, the population was at 263 but this then steeply dropped to 198 in 1921. This was most likely due to World War 1 leading to a vast decrease in population. Since 1961, there has been a sharper increase in population, going from 267 to 389 today. It is important to note that there was no census information between 1961 and 2001, so there may have been changes here that were not recorded. Today, the population may be increasing due to a growing population, as well as the growing number of businesses in Bransford. In 1881 there were 129 males and 128 females living in Bransford. This has changed quite drastically today, as there are 187 males and 202 females. Due to this rise in population there was an increase in housing, going from 62 houses in 1881 compared with the 171 households there are in Bransford today. The mean age in Bransford is 49.4 and the median age is 53. The largest age bracket is 45‚Äì59 years old, as 23.9% of people in Bransford are of this age.  Transport  Bransford lies on the A4103 road, making it accessible. It is served by the 417 and 423 bus services and the nearest train station is Worcester Foregate Street. Until 1965, there was a Great Western Railway station on the Bransford Road. It closed on 5 April 1965, possibly from lack of need. For many, having a car or van is the main method of transport as out of the 171 households, 161 own at least one car or van.

It is the largest farming village near Evesham. At the 2001 census, Bretforton had a population of 1,023 in 428 households. The area of the parish is 2.83 square miles (7.33 square kilometres). There is a village hall, a garage, a sports and social club, a village pub (the Fleece Inn) and a Royal British Legion club. Bretforton is also home to the Bretforton Silver Band that can trace its roots back to 1895 when it was known as Bretforton Temperance Band.http://www.bretfortonsilverband.co.uk Unusually for a village of its size, Bretforton has three substantial large gentry dwellings with large Jacobean manor house, a Gothic hall and a grange.  History  The Planet Produce warehouse in Bretforton. Planet Produce is a fresh produce provider. (2010) The village name has changed little over the centuries: the earliest documented record of the town, a charter of 709, records it as Bretforton, the Saxon 'Ton' a modern spelling of the Saxon (Germanic) 'tun' which meant enclosure or village. It has also been recorded as Brotfortun in a Saxon deed from 714, which states the town's name as 'Brotfortun', meaning 'the ford with planks', possibly referencing the footbridge which stands alongside the ford. The village was owned as outlying farmland of Evesham Abbey. The settlement is distinguished historically by an unusual system of land ownership. In the 16th century, following the Dissolution of the Monasteries (and Evesham Abbey) in the 1540s, the manor was sold to the tenants and a new class of land-owning yeomen was set up. Some of them built the houses still standing here, either of stone with mullioned windows or timber-framed. One of the yeomen became Auditor to Catherine of Aragon. Other noteworthy features of the settlement are several dovecotes, one dating to 1630 and another containing some 800 holes.  Local legends  The village has several local legends of ghosts. * Spot Loggins Well is an old water well, about four hundred years old and is named after a cattle drover called Spot Loggins who drowned in a cattle spring in the 17th century. Local legend states that any who runs around the well three times while blindfolded will lose anything they are carrying. The Water Well is located on the old Bretforton House Farm of the Appleby family and the Spot Loggin ghost is celebrated locally in November at the local Fleece Inn. *The ghost of Lola Taplin, former landlady of the Fleece Inn, is said to haunt the bar, throwing food and other objects. * A phantom funeral procession arrives at the church, though for whom it represents is a mystery. * Fields on either side of the church are said to be haunted by a decapitated woman, carrying her head under arm.

Fleece Inn during filming in 1993. Owned by the National Trust, the Fleece Inn was originally built in the early 15th century as a longhouse by a prosperous yeoman farmer called Byrd.The Fleece Inn Official Website A longhouse is an early type of farmhouse which incorporated accommodation for livestock on the ground floor, alongside the family's living quarters. This particular longhouse later became a pub and was rebuilt in the 17th century, but remained in the Byrd family until 1977 when Lola Taplin bequeathed it to the National Trust. Lola was a direct descendant of Mr Byrd and lived her entire life at the Fleece. She died at 83, having run the pub on her own for the last 30 years of her life. The inn suffered serious fire damage in February 2005 and has now been completely restored. A curious mediaeval tradition also survives at the Fleece, preserved in accordance with Lola's wishes. This is the practice of chalking \\"witch circles\\" on the floor in front of each hearth to prevent witches from getting in through the chimneys. There are \\"witch marks\\" on the inside of the door as well to ward off evil spirits, The BBC has also used the Fleece Inn and the surrounding village green for its 1993 ¬£5 million production of Charles Dickens' Martin Chuzzlewit where the pub was renamed the \\"Green Dragon\\" for the duration of shooting.

He was the first British Armed Forces musician to be knighted. Early life Francis Vivian Dunn was born in Jabalpur, India. His father, William James Dunn, was bandmaster of the Second Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps and later director of music of the Royal Horse Guards. Dunn studied piano with his mother, Beatrice Maud, and undertook choral studies in Winchester. He attended the Hochschule f√ºr Musik K√∂ln in 1923 and, two years later, the Royal Academy of Music. He studied conducting with Henry Wood and composition with Walton O'Donnell. As a violinist, he performed in the Queen's Hall Promenade Orchestra (under Wood), and in 1930 was a founding member of the BBC Symphony Orchestra (under several conductors). Career Dunn was released from his contract with the BBC and on 3 September 1931 commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Marines to be director of music for the Portsmouth Division of the Corps. His duties included directing the Royal Marines Band on the Royal Yacht, where he encountered the Royal Family. Princess Margaret later recalled that Dunn was her childhood hero. Dunn participated in the royal tour of South Africa on board in 1947 and a Royal Marines band tour of the United States and Canada in 1949. His promotion to lieutenant-colonel and principal director of music of the Royal Marines followed in 1953. Dunn and the Royal Marines Band accompanied Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on the for the post-coronation Commonwealth Tour. Upon its completion, the Queen appointed Dunn CVO, and in 1960 OBE. In 1955, Dunn was asked by Euan Lloyd of Warwick Films to compose the theme music for The Cockleshell Heroes (which was otherwise scored by John Addison). He appears as himself, conducting the Royal Marines, in the end titles of the 1966 film Thunderbirds Are Go. For the latter, a cherry picker was used for filming, and Dunn insisted on being on the crane itself. But every time he started, the camera rocked. And as Dunn got more excited with the music, the camera rocked more and more to the point where the crew thought they were going to come off the crane, hence director David Lane had to ask Dunn if he could conduct from the floor instead.Thunderbirds Are Go DVD commentary Upon retiring from the military in December 1968, Dunn became a guest conductor with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. He also recorded with the Light Music Society Orchestra. In 1969, he received an EMI Golden Disc for sales of more than one million Royal Marines Band records. In the same year, he was also elected an honorary member of the American Bandmasters Association. In 1987, he received the Sudler Medal of the Order of Merit from the John Philip Sousa Foundation. He became the Founder President of the International Military Music Society in 1976, a position which he held until his death. In 1988, after serving as the Senior Warden, Dunn became the first military musician to be installed as the Master of the Worshipful Company of Musicians. Compositions Dunn composed and arranged over 60 pieces of music. Several are marches, many with connections to the Royal Marines. These include The Globe and Laurel (1935, revised 1945), The Captain General (1949), Cockleshell Heroes (1955) and Mountbatten March (1972). He arranged many others, including Russian Preobrajensky March (author unknown); later to become the official slow march of the Royal Marines) and A Life on the Ocean Wave (the official quick march). Personal life Dunn married Margery 'Mike' Halliday in 1938. They had one son (Patrick) and two daughters (Leonie and Rosemary). He died of lung cancer in Haywards Heath, Sussex on 3 April 1995, aged 86. He is buried at Cemetery Chapel, Great Walstead, East Sussex.

Life Tan's grandmother was the daughter of a physician. One reason Tan's grandfather married her grandmother was to learn medicine himself. Two of her grandparents' sons were able to pass the jinshi examinations, and they became officials. One of these sons was Tan's father. Due to the fondness her grandparents had for her, which evidence shows was directly related to her intellect, her grandparents passed on their medical knowledge to her. Tan Yunxian later married, raised four children, and practiced medicine on women. Tan lived a longer life than most, dying at the age of 93.Ebrey, Patricia B., Walthall Anne and Palais, James B. Pre-Modern East Asia: To 1800 (Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2006) 279. Medical activity Tan Yunxian's medical practice was contained to treating women. She initially began by treating her own children, with her grandmother's guidance to confirm her diagnoses. Records of Tan's book reveal cases of thirty-one of the patients that she treated. The women she worked with usually had chronic complaints, rather than of temporary illnesses. In Ming China, many of the women had ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs complaints,‚Äù such as menstrual irregularities, repeated miscarriages, barrenness, and postpartum fatigue. Other patients had illnesses that either sex could contract, such as coughing, insomnia, rashes, swellings, diarrhea or nausea. Tan, similar to other literati doctors, often prescribed herbal medications to her patients. Tan also practiced moxibustion. This was the burning of moxa, or dried Artemisia, at specified points on the body, which was similar to acupuncture.Merriam-Webster‚Äôs Collegiate Dictionary-11th Edition (USA: Merriam-Webster, 2004) 813 This process, stimulated the circulation of qi. Since the physician applying the moxa had to physically touch the patient, male doctors were unable to perform this treatment on women. Tan served many working women in her practice. Various accounts show Tan's conclusions of how these women often overworked themselves, thus bringing on various symptoms.Zheng Jin-Sheng. ‚ÄúFemale Medical Workers in Ancient China,‚Äù http://www.cintcm.com/e_cintcm/e_forum/female%20medical%20workers%20in%20ancient%20china.htm (accessed August 12, 2007). Although Tan Yunxian was able to practice gynecology, pediatrics and obstetrics, her experience in other fields was limited. Tan was only able to practice medicine in the country among her friends or acquaintances. Even after she completed the book Sayings of a Female Doctor,Translated as: Wilcox, Lorraine, tr., Miscellaneous Records of a Female Doctor (Portland, OR: The Chinese Medicine Database, 2015) she was not able to publish it. In fact, she had to ask her son to have printing blocks cut for her.Ebrey, 280. Status of female physicians in Ming China Quite different from their male counterparts of ancient China, women did not hone their skills from masters nor did they have the purpose or goal in mind to set up their own clinics after their apprenticeship. For females, family training was the standard mode of education. While women were quite skilled in their medical techniques, they rarely made any theoretical additions to the field. Unlike the male doctors of the times, women received medical training in order to assist the males in their family by doing some ‚Äúsupporting work.‚ÄùZheng Jin- Sheng. ‚ÄúFemale Medical Workers in Ancient China.‚Äù Popular portrayal A character that combines Tan with Jingtai Emperor consort Empress Hang was portrayed by Cecilia Liu in 2016 Chinese historical drama series The Imperial Doctress.

It traces itself back to an organization founded by Saint John Bosco.  History  There is no history actually written about altar boys or use of that name during the early days of the Church, except for the word acolyte (the one who follows; a companion). It was instituted, by the Church, as a sacramental participation in the order of deacon. As preparatory steps to priesthood, an aspirant shall pass the following minor ranks of Holy Order: Tonsure, Porter, Lector, Exorcist, and Acolyte. Acolyte, therefore, is the highest of minor Orders, and whose chief duties are to carry candles in procession, to light the candles on the altar, and to assist the priest in saying the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass (although the acolyte is not necessary for the effect of the Mass to take place; only the priest is required). In the 9th century, at the Synod of Mainz, a decree was passed that \\"every priest should have a cleric or boy to read the epistle or lesson, to answer him at mass, and with whom he can chant the psalms.\\" This is a clear indication for the substitution of altar boys for minor clerics of acolyte dating back for more than 1,000 years. Since this privilege was granted, altar boys have had an active part in divine worship. There have been hundreds of thousands of these boys whose noblest common desire is to serve, glorify, and give honor to God. One fact stands out that from among these boy servers rose some of the great and famous Church figures, like Francis Xavier, Cardinal Newman, Paschal Baylon, Martin de Porres, and Pope Pius X.  In modern times  Although John Bosco gave the name Knights of the Altar, Fr. Francis E. Benz was the first to formally organize and found the society for altar boys in 1938. Fr. Benz was a priest in the Archdiocese of Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA when Archbishop John Gregory Murray granted his approval to the organization which has these following objectives: :1.) To form a worthy guard of honor to our Divine Eucharistic King, in whose service we willingly assume the dignity and honor to become Knights of the Altar. :2.) To render faithful, reverent and edifying service to God by assisting his visible representatives, the Bishops and Priests, in offering the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and in all other liturgical and devotional functions. :3.) To enkindle greater piety and devotion in the hearts of the faithful of the congregation whom we represent at the altar, by reverently performing the duties of our holy office and by a good example in our daily lives. :4.) To foster vocation among members. In 1948, Ave Maria Press of the Congregation of Holy Cross assumed the sponsorship with Fr. Frank Gartland, C.S.C., Fr. Thomas McNally, C.S.C., and Bro. James Lakofka, C.S.C., who were mainly responsible for the supervision of the organization and publication of Catholic Boy Magazine, an organ established also by Fr. Benz. Charles M. Kerins was the primary Cover Artist for Catholic Boy Magazine in the 1950s and 1960s. Kerins provided classical images of a contemporary boyhood. After the Vatican II, for some time in 1969, the magazine stopped circulation, and left a communication gap among its member units and knights. But providentially, in December 1970, Joseph DeSilvestro was designated as National Director, assisted by the Holy Cross Fathers as his advisers. From the University of Notre Dame to Marseilles, then to Ottawa, Illinois, its office is now in Lakeland, Florida. Today, it has 3,000 registered unit members throughout the world and 38 brother countries are affiliated, and more new units are being established. Restructured with regional and general advisers, Bishop Edward W. O'Rourke accepted and continued to serve as Spiritual Moderator. An auspicious development turned up when the office move to Lakeland, Florida as the Salesian religious family of priests, brothers, and sisters and co-operators of John Bosco, and Mary Help of Christians School in Tampa, Florida backed up the organization. A member of the order has joined the Advisory Board of the Knights of the Altar. In 1974, when K of A representatives gathered in Rome during its 35th anniversary that coincided with All Saints Day, Pope Paul VI sanctified boy servers in the Sacred Congregation to the Pontifical Work for Ecclesiastical Vocations when he said that \\"Mass servers as the first seminary.\\" In 1978, a revised K of A Handbook was published (first edition was in 1971), with a new program, revised materials, and a renewed effort to promote K of A society and to foster vocations. In 2008, the Knights of the Altar Society, North America was established and is actively engaged in rebuilding the organization.

Other villages nearby include Astwood Bank, Feckenham, Cookhill and Webheath. History Callow Hill can be traced back to the 16th century, when small cottages were built. In the mid-1600s further expansion came, as cottages, which still stand today, were built. Callow Hill stayed the same throughout the 18th and 19th century, unlike nearby Feckenham and Redditch, Callow Hill did not have needle factories. In the beginning of the 20th century the Callow Hill & Walkwood Golf Club was founded, members could play on a small course, the exact location is not known, but it is thought to be in between Love Lyne and Callow Hill Lane, due to the way the hill is formed. The Redditch Golf Club was founded in 1913 on the site and in the late 1920s moved to a larger site in Redditch Town Centre. In the early 1970s Redditch New Town Development Corporation planned to build the Bromsgrove Highway as part of the planned New Town highway infrastructure, it was constructed through the Golf Course. It was decided that Redditch Golf Club would be moved back to Callow Hill, but on green-field land adjacent to Upper Grinsty Farm (Now known as Morton Stanley Park). The remainder of the course in the town was renamed Pitcheroak Golf course, a municipal course for anyone to use, whereas the Callow Hill site club remained for private members. Redditch Golf Club relocated in 1972 to Lower Grinsty Lane. Part of Marlpit Lane was covered over with earth for the course, the rest of lane was severed by Windmill Drive. Part of Green Lane, to the west of Morton Stanley Park, was by passed as the existing 16th century lane could not cope with the traffic. In the early 1980s development began for an 'Victorian style village', the original part of the estate followed the Valley, which has later been interrupted by further development. The estate was officially opened on 7 September 1984. Since the further development came, and the former Riding School was bought in the mid-1990s and many homes were built on. Based in Callow Hill is a wine company, Callow Hill Country Wine which has its headquarters on Brookhouse Lane in the village. Morton Stanley Park Morton Stanley Park is a public park located to the north of Callow Hill. It was opened in 1986 and is run by Redditch Borough Council, however it is not owned by them. The land today that makes up Morton Stanley Park, was once Upper Grinsty Farm, which was bought in 1913 by William Morton Stanley. Stanley was a rich factory owner and retired to Upper Grinsty and lived the rest of his life there. In 1921, he edited his will, which resulted in Upper Grinsty Farm being given to the people of Redditch and Webheath. Stanley died three years later at the age of 84, little did he know his land would not be open to the public until over 60 years later. Upper Grinsty Farmhouse, became derelict and run-down until it was finally demolished in 1959. 5 years later when Redditch became a New Town, the Development Corporation wanted to build a housing estate on his land, however these plans were halted by the Headless Cross Residents Association. In 1978, the far-eastern fringes of Stanley's land was in fact built on, but Redditch Council gave council owned land to the west of the estate to compensate. Windmill Drive was built and after 60 years of waiting the park opened to the public with two carparks, one in the east in Headless Cross and one in the west in Callow Hill. The Callow Hill Windmill The Windmill referred to in the name of Windmill Drive was situated on the top of Callow Hill. The following information is taken from: 'Windmills in Shropshire Hereford and Worcester': Wilfred A Seaby, Arthur C Smith. Stevenage Museum Publications. REDDITCH (FECKENHAM) SP 027647. Brick Tower Mill on Callow Hill, Walkwood Common. Advertised in Birmingham Gazette (23 December 1833) for sale and as 'newly erected'. Again to be sold with sails, gearing, stones and other machinery complete in the Midland Counties Herald (24 Feb 1848). A brick portion not very high was standing about 1855. Today the site is marked by a semicircle of trees and a small paddock adjoining the extended meeting house Windmill Cottage; a Peak runner stone was on the site in January 1983. Parts from the Callow Hill Windmill are buried in the grounds of Windmill Cottage, in the paddock. Windmill Cottage, Callow Hill, Redditch The semicircle of trees is still in place, but the approaching short 'lane' has changed at least one of its hedgerows (from Google maps). The position of the windmill is visible on old (1884‚Äì1891) O.S. maps. The correct grid reference is SP028648. Windmill Cottage Satellite (hedgerow visible) The Gazebo and village The Gazebo, on Foxholes Lane, is Callow Hill's village hall. It is also used as a polling station. Very occasionally village meetings are held but only a maximum of twenty-thirty people can attend because the Gazebo is so small. Situated near the Gazebo is the Callow Hill village pond, which is surrounded by trees and greenery. There are two major roads travelling through Callow Hill, Foxholes Lane and Callow Hill Lane, which is the major linking Redditch to Hanbury, Droitwich Spa, Pershore, Worcester and the M5. Bus services Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday there is a bus service from Pershore travelling to Sainsbury's in Redditch and stopping via the Gazebo in Callow Hill. The route is operated by the local bus operators, N.N Creswall of Evesham. There is also another bus route operated by the Woosh bus company based in Droitwich Spa. It is operated by Worcestershire County Council. Politics Callow Hill falls within the parliamentary constituency of Redditch which as of the June 2017 General Election is represented by Rachel Maclean, (Conservative). The constituency was previously represented by former Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith ( Labour) who resigned her position in June 2009 following allegations of misappropriation of her MP expense allowance. Redditch Borough Council Callow Hill is part of the Crabbs Cross ward of Redditch Borough Council; in which two councillors are elected in rotation for four years each.

During the 2007 United Kingdom floods, many homes were affected for the second time in a decade. Charlton lies between the River Avon and Bredon Hill. Evesham is 3 miles to the east, and Pershore 5 miles to the west, but its postal address is Pershore rather than Evesham. Fladbury and Cropthorne are its neighbouring villages, both within a mile Fladbury is just over the River Avon and Cropthorne up the hill. Manor In 1240 William de Handsacre held Charlton Manor and in 1267‚Äì8 he was accused of carrying off the goods of Thomas de Arderne from this manor (presumably Arderne was a tenant). William did not appear to answer the plea, and the sheriff was commanded to take all his lands and tenements into the king's hands. William had evidently fallen under the king's displeasure before this time, for in 1266 he was granted a safe conduct coming to the king's court to stand his trial. However he must have received pardons as William paid a subsidy of 30s. at Cropthorne in 1280, and was holding the manor in 1292 and in 1299. Sir Simon Handsacre, possibly his son, is said to have been Lord of Charlton in 1331‚Äì2, and William de Handsacre was in possession in 1346. Another Sir Simon, who had succeeded the 1346 William, died before 1383‚Äì4, leaving only three daughters, Eleanor wife of Richard Dineley, Elizabeth wife of Roger Colmon (and afterwards of Peter de Melburn), and Isabel wife of Lawrence Frodley. Richard Dineley and Elizabeth were dealing with a third of the manor in 1386‚Äì7, and three years later the co-heirs conveyed the manor to trustees, evidently for the purpose of settling it on the Dineleys, to whom the whole afterwards passed until the middle of the 18th century. Notables include Edward Dynley (1600-1646), Lord of Charlton Manor, a Cavalier killed during the Civil War, and Sir Edward Dineley of Charlton, who was knighted in 1681 and served as Deputy Lieutenant for Worcestershire in 1682.https://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/worcs/vol3/pp322-329  Village Make-up  Along with neighbouring village Cropthorne, it shares a primary school and a pre school. The pre school is in Charlton behind the Church in the Old School Rooms, whereas Cropthorne and Charlton C of E First School is situated up in Cropthorne. The Village has over 200 houses, and is roughly centred on the Green, which has Merrybrook (Now classified as a river) running through its centre. The Gardener's Arms Pub is set just off the Green, and is now the main meeting point for the village following the closure of the local shop and postage stamp sized Post Office. The village also has a cemetery and post box. It is also on the Worcester-Evesham 551 and 550 bus route, used by Children to get to and from Prince Henry's High School and Bredonhill Middle School Events Once a year the Charlton Fayre is held in the centre of the village. The village green is generally the hub of activities, with the pub playing a large part in the festivities. The Gardener's Arms have over the past few years held and organised many special events such as the Help for Heroes event. Sports Charlton does not strictly have any representative Sports teams currently. Formerly the Football team the Charlton Swifts used to be a very successful club in the local area, but this has not been so for over half a century. Fladbury Athletic has a large base of Charlton residents and Charlton raised players, as well as using the Gardener's Arms as their post match venue.

Being on the edge of the North Cotswolds it has a mixture of building styles, from Cotswold limestone to red brick, to the more traditional Worcestershire black and white half timber and thatch. The earliest buildings are timber framed with wattle and daub and Cotswold limestone. The name Childswickham is believed to have derived from 'Child', the young son of a nobleman, 'wick', a clearing in the wood and 'ham', short for hamlet. Its history can be traced back to Roman times as coins and pottery of this era were found in fields on the old Roman road from Worcester to London which came through the village.

It is the largest of the surrounding Lenches, accommodating the Lenches Sports Club, the Lenches Members' Club, Church Lench First School, Church Lench preschool and the Church Lench Village Hall. Origin of Lench The name 'Lench', shared by five local villages, comes from an Anglo-Saxon word 'linch', meaning 'rising ground, hill'. There are five Lenches. In descending order of size, they are Church Lench, Rous Lench, Atch Lench, Sheriffs Lench and Ab Lench. Ab Lench is often mistakenly called 'Abbots Lench', but this is due a clerical error confusing the name of the village with the fact that the Lenches lands were owned for some time by Evesham Abbey. Ab Lench has never gone by the name Abbots Lench. Parish The ancient parish of Church Lench appears in the Domesday Book of 1086. Its earliest recorded history reveals that it was a gift by Kenred of Mercia to Evesham Abbey in 708. Its church, All Saints, is currently Church of England, and its earliest recorded priest was in residence in 1086. The 12th-century church was significantly extended during the 14th century and the 15th century. Church Lench has been a farming community for all of its recorded history. The subsoil is lower lias clay, the surface soil is clay and sand. The civil parish was renamed from Church Lench to South Lenches on 18 December 2012.

Completed toroidal coil sculpture, along with a model of a wood screw and a small dodecahedron. Each of these objects was fabricated out of pure sugar. CandyFab 5000 machine at the 2008 Maker Faire event The CandyFab is a method of producing physical objects out of a computer representation of the structure. It differs from some other 3D printing methods in the following aspects: * It is optimized for relatively large pieces using low to medium print resolution. * To reduce the hazards of working with large amounts of media, non-toxic materials (ideally, food-grade) are used. The prototype CandyFab 4000 unit uses granulated sugar as its print medium, giving rise to its name, but other materials with low melting temperatures and low toxicities are still under consideration. * It uses low cost parts and construction to make it easier for others to design or build their own, with plans available as open source. Technology The CandyFab uses a heat source mounted on a computer-controlled X-Y positioning head to fuse the surface of a granular bed of the print media. The only thing which comes into contact with the media is heated air, which is turned on and off by the software synchronously with the motion of the positioning head. Fabrication of the shape of the part being produced progresses in layers; after each complete pass, the bed is lowered and a fresh layer of granular media is applied on top. The unfused media serves to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, reducing the need for auxiliary temporary supports for the workpiece. The movable bed is of a size suitable for producing finished parts several kilograms in weight. The resolution of features produced correspond to a smallest volume element of 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.7 mm or less.Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories - Solid freeform fabrication: DIY, on the cheap, and made of pure sugar Pieces produced from ordinary granular sugar have fairly good strength and feature an amber to brown surface color owing to caramelization of the sugar. Special attention has been paid to the selection of all materials coming into contact with the sugar bed or with the hot air stream to make it possible to fabricate food-grade pieces if desired. There is an effort to encourage further work on improving the technology in the following areas: *Hardware *3D modeling software *CNC software In addition, the inventors Windell Oskay and Lenore Edman of candyfab.org have organized teams to explore applications, gastronomy, and post processing.

History  The village is an excellent example of an Anglo-Saxon settlement overlooking the River Teme, situated on the ancient salt route that led from Droitwich to Leominster. The earliest surviving mention of the village is in the Latin charter of King Athelstan, granting it to the monks of St. Peter's Monastery in Worcester in 934 AD when it was referred to as Clistun ultra Tame. During the time of the wars with the Welsh, the manor of Clifton became established and was granted Royal Borough status by Edward III of England in 1377, allowing it to hold a weekly market on Thursdays and an annual four-day fair. The original manor house, built around 1200 on the site of the present Lion Inn, eventually came to be used as a hostelry for travellers en route between Worcester and Tenbury Wells.

At the 2001 census it had a population of 2,600. Parish History The parishes of Clent and Broome were once an exclave of Staffordshire, completely surrounded by Worcestershire, having been seized by the Sheriff of Staffordshire before the Norman Conquest. This anomaly was addressed in 1844 when it was belatedly returned to Worcestershire. Clent had, however, always remained part of the Worcester Diocese. The four stones or \\"Ossian's Tomb\\" on the top of the Clent Hills were follies erected by George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton Geography Because of the hilly topography of the parish the village consists of several distinct hamlets. These are Upper Clent (Clatterbach and the area around the parish church of St. Leonard), Lower Clent, Holy Cross, Adams Hill and Walton Pool.A History of the County of Worcester: volume 3 pp. 50-54 The Civil Parish of Clent also included part of the village of West Hagley, the population of which is about half that of the whole parish. On the first of April 2016, this part of the parish was transferred to the Parish of Hagley. Though in the ancient ecclesiastical parish of Clent, that area is now part of the Anglican parish of Broome.

The operation dubbed Lightning Hammer consisted of approximately 16,000 Iraqi Security and Coalition Forces and was a large-scale offensive to defeat al-Qaeda and other terrorist cells seeking safe haven throughout the Diyala River Valley. Staff Sgt. Donnie Dixon pulls security while conducting an Operation Lightning Hammer patrol in Mukeisha, Iraq, 14 Aug 2007. Taking advantage of concentrated forces in Diyala province, Lightning Hammer‚Äôs goal was to target al-Qaeda elements that fled from Baqouba into the outlying regions north of Diyala‚Äôs capital city. In addition to the thousands of soldiers and their ISF counterparts participating in Lightning Hammer, attack helicopters, close-air support, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and tanks complement the combined effort.Multi-National Force - Iraq Public Affairs Office release: Operation Lightning Hammer pursues al-Qaeda Col.

This barrage set the stage for subsequent nighttime helo-borne and ground assaults into the Diyala River Valley by 5th Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment, and 6-9 Armored Reconnaissance Squadron, respectively. These forces combined with other units already conducting operation Lightning Hammer elsewhere in Diyala and Salah ad Din provinces, totaling approximately 10,000 Coalition Forces and 6,000 Iraqi Security Forces. The 5-73 Soldiers defeated several ineffective small arms attacks, killing three al-Qaeda gunmen, detaining eight, and uncovering a weapons cache, numerous IEDs and a booby-trapped house. In a supporting offensive north of Baqouba, the 5th Iraqi Army Division and 5-20th Infantry Regiment discovered an ISI hideout, complete with bedrolls, believed to house 25 fighters, along with a substantial weapons cache of IED making material, mortars and rocket propelled grenades.

Following the transfer of authority for MND-N from the 25th Infantry Division (Task Force Lightning) to the 1st Armored Division (Task Force Iron) in late October 2008,1st Armored Division Begins Mission In Iraq Operation Iron Hammer was launched as a follow-up to Lighting Hammer II in November 2007. The operation was jointly planned by the two commands. The initial focus of the operation was the Za'ab Triangle, a rural area in the Kirkuk province, an al Qaida in Iraq safe haven and a likely location for an insurgent withdrawal from Coalition forces following their defeat in Diyala. The operation ultimately expanded to include all five US brigade combat teams in all four provinces in MND-N's area of operations. All 4 of the Iraqi Army divisions in the area were also involved. 79 arms caches, 29,000 liters of nitric acid, 500 mortar and artillery rounds, and one of the largest EFP caches ever found in Iraq were uncovered during the two-week operation.Operation Iron Hammer  Institute for the Study of War Operation Iron Hammer was in turn followed by Operation Iron Reaper on 27 November 2007. Iron Reaper looked to continue to disrupt al-Qaida in Iraq elements in northern Iraq. In particular, the Khalis corridor in Diyala, the Za'ab triangle and western Mosul were targeted by 4 of the 5 US brigades, as well as the 2nd, 3rd and 5th divisions of the Iraqi army. As a result of reconciliation efforts made during Iron Hammer, a new Concerned Local Citizens group was also established in Hawijah, southwest of Kirkuk.Operation Iron Reaper  Institute for the Study of War = Multi-National Division - Center (MND-C) OperationsOperation Marne Husky On 15 August 2007, Operation Marne Husky was launched. It targeted insurgents in the Tigris River Valley who had been forced to withdraw from safe havens in Arab Jabour and Salman Pak by previous operations. The operation involved a series of air assaults across the southern Baghdad Belts because the canals and irrigation in the area limited Coalition mobility. Seven air assaults were launched by soldiers from the 4th BCT/25th Infantry Division and pilots from the 3rd Combat Aviation Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division. 80 insurgents were captured and 43 killed as a result of this operation, which also saw the first sustainable Concerned Local Citizen movements south of Baghdad. In September 2007, Marne Husky evolved into Operation Marne Torch II. Operation Marne Torch II This operation involved the continued development and support of the Concerned Local Citizen groups by the Coalition forces, particularly the 2nd Heavy Brigade Combat Team (HBCT) of the 3rd Infantry Division. A force of between 700-1000 men was raised which enabled the Coalition forces to target al Qaida in Iraq with greater precision. Approximately 250 ISI operatives were killed or captured during the operation, including 6 high-valued targets. Marne Torch II was followed in mid-October by Operation Marne Anvil. Operation Marne Anvil Instead of previous operations which focused on Sunni extremists and ISI, Marne Anvil targeted Shia extremists linked with Muqtada al-Sadr's Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) located east of Baghdad. It was succeeded by Operation Marne Courageous in November. Operation Marne Courageous Marne Courageous was launched on 16 November 2007, targeting key ISI supply depots in the Yusufiyah area of the Euphrates River Valley, south east of Baghdad. It began with a major air assault conducted by 450 soldiers of the 3BCT/101st Airborne Division, 150 Iraqi soldiers and 70 Concerned Local Citizens near the villages of Owesat and al-Betra. Marne Courageous was followed by Operation Marne Roundup on 15 December 2007. Operation Marne Roundup The focus of this operation was Iskandariyah, Babil province. On the first day of the operation, Coalition forces uncovered and destroyed a large tunnel network used by ISI to hide weapons and fighters along the banks of the Euphrates River. A large cache was turned over to coalition forces by a Concerned Local Citizen group on the same day. Operation Marne Roundup concluded at the beginning of January 2008 with the launch of Operation Marne Thunderbolt, part of the new corps-level Operation Phantom Phoenix.

They are somewhat tern-like but like other skimmers, have a short upper mandible and the longer lower mandible that is ploughed along the surface of water as the bird flies over the water to pick aquatic prey. It is found in southern Asia, where it is patchily distributed and declining in numbers. They are mainly found in rivers or estuaries. They are very brightly marked in black, white and orange, making them difficult to miss.  Description  The bill is thin and knife-like to reduce resistance to water This bird has a black cap and orange bill that contrasts with the white body. With its long wings it looks tern-like and is about 40‚Äì43 cm long with a wingspan of 108 cm. The upper parts of the body are dark black and the underparts are white. The black cap on the head leaves the forehead and nape white. The wings are long and pointed with a white trailing edge. The short, forked tail is white with blackish central feathers. The long, thick bill is orange with a yellow tip and, like the other skimmers, has a lower mandible which is longer than the upper mandible. The legs and feet are red. The lower bill is knife-like and flexible and the tip appears truncated. Young birds have bills that appear normal and with age the lower mandible grows. The upper mandible is capable of considerable mobility. Non-breeding adults are duller and browner than breeding birds. Juveniles are grey-brown above with pale fringes to the feathers on the back and wings. The head has more white than in adult birds and the bill is orange-brown with a dark tip. It has a high, nasal, screaming kyap-kyap call but is usually very silent. The black skimmer of the Americas is larger with a black tip to the bill. The African skimmer is smaller with more black in the tail and no white collar. In older times the Indian skimmer was also known as the Indian scissors-bill. Distribution and habitat  An Indian skimmer seen skimming for food in the River Chambal near Dholpur, Rajasthan. It is found on large rivers and lakes, swamps and coastal wetlands such as estuaries. It is most common on freshwater, particularly during the breeding season. Breeding colonies are on islands or sandy spits, usually in rivers. Its range has become increasingly fragmented in recent decades. It is still found in parts of Pakistan in the Indus river system of Kashmir and northern and central India along the Ganges, Bangladesh and Burma and formerly occurred in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. It is a scarce non-breeding visitor to Nepal and has occurred as a vagrant in Oman and central Thailand with old records from Iran and China. At present, the last strongholds of the Indian Skimmer are India, and Bangladesh. They are more widespread in winter and are found in coastal estuaries of western and eastern India as far south as Karwar on the western coast and; Chennai and Pondicherry on the eastern coast exist. A 1713 illustration in John Rays Synopsis methodica avium & piscium with a description of the \\"Madrass Sea Crow\\" by Edward Buckley Breeding colonies are known from the Chambal river area, an area that is of importance for the gharial. Sand banks are important for the nesting of Gharials. They have also been documented as breeding on the banks of the Mahanadi river at the Munduli barrage, Chandaka Wildlife Division in Cuttack.  Behaviour  100px The birds forage for food by flying low over the water with the bill open and the lower mandible skimming through the water. When a fish is encountered, it moves up the lower mandible and the bird raises the upper mandible and snaps it with a movement of the head. They forage in small flocks and often associate with terns. They feed mainly on fish but also take small crustaceans and insect larvae. They often feed at dusk and can be very nocturnal. The breeding season is mainly March and May. They breed in colonies of up to 40 pairs, often with terns and other birds. The nest is a simple scrape on the ground mainly on open sand banks that provide unobstructed views of any oncoming predators. The eggs are buff or white with brown blotches and streaks. There are three to five eggs in a clutch. They may indulge in a low- level of inter-specific brood parasitism, laying their eggs in the nests of river terns (Sterna aurantia). The birds tend to incubate the eggs more during the cooler hours of the day and are often away from the nest during the hotter parts of the day. Incubating adults are said to indulge in belly-soaking behaviour to cool the eggs. A bird at nest was once observed to pick up (and drop into water) an intruding chick of a river tern using its leg.  Conservation  The species was formerly widely distributed in the rivers of the Indian subcontinent and along the river systems of Myanmar and Mekong. Records from Laos,Harmand, F. J.

The population is now mainly within India and Pakistan and is estimated to be about 6,000-10,000 individuals. The decreasing population has led it to being classed as vulnerable by the IUCN. It is threatened by habitat loss and degradation, pollution and disturbance by humans. Most colonies are unprotected but some lie within nature reserves such as National Chambal Sanctuary in India.

Serials typically follow main story arcs that span entire television seasons or even the full run of the series, which distinguishes them from traditional episodic television that relies on more stand-alone episodes. Worldwide, the soap opera is the most prominent form of serial dramatic programming. Serials rely on keeping the full nature of the story hidden and revealing elements episode by episode to keep viewers tuning in to learn more. Often these shows employ recapping segments at the beginning and cliffhangers at the end of each episode. Such shows also place a demand on viewers to tune in to every episode to follow the plot. The invention of recording devices such as VCRs and DVRs has made following this type of show easier, which has resulted in increased success and popularity. Prior to the advent of DVRs, television networks shunned serials in prime time as they made broadcast programming reruns more difficult and television producers shunned them because they were tougher to go into broadcast syndication years down the road. Serials contrast with episodic television, with plots relying on a more independent stand-alone format. Procedural drama television programs are commonly episodic, sometimes including a serial subplot. Shorter serial programs known as telenovelas (and earlier, radionovelas), originating and often produced in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking Latin America, have become popular worldwide. Terminology The term \\"serial\\" refers to the intrinsic property of a seriesnamely its order. In literature, the term is used as a noun to refer to a format (within a genre) by which a story is told in contiguous (typically chronological) installments in sequential issues of a single periodical publication. More generally, \\"serial\\" is applied in library and information science to materials \\"in any medium issued under the same title in a succession of discrete parts, usually numbered (or dated) and appearing at regular or irregular intervals with no predetermined conclusion.\\"Reitz, Joan M. (2004). Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science. Retrieved March 15, 2006 The term has been used for a radio or television production with a continuously evolving, unified plot and set of characters, spread over multiple episodes. In the United States, daytime soap operas have long had a serial structure. Television mini-series also commonly come in a serial form. Starting in the mid-1970s, series with soap opera-like stories began to be aired in prime time (e.g. Dallas, Dynasty). In the 1990s, shows like The X-Files and The Sopranos began to use a more serial structure, and now there are a much wider range of shows in serial form.Jason Mittell. 2015. Complex TV: The Poetics of Contemporary Television Storytelling. NYU Press. History The serial began with the advent of movie serials of the early 20th century. With the emergence of television and subsequent decline of the movie-going audience, production of movie serials ceased due to the decreasing revenues. But the serial lived on, moving instead to the small screen and the world of Broadcast syndication television reruns. Soap operas The television serial format as known today originated in radio, in the form of children's adventure shows and daily 15-minute programs known as soap operas (so-called because many of these shows were sponsored by soap companies, such as Colgate-Palmolive and Procter & Gamble). Soap operas were specifically engineered to appeal to women (with the intention of increasing sale of soap). They usually ran from Monday through Friday at the same time every day. A show called The Smith Family which ran only one night a week on WENR in Chicago during the early 1930s was credited as the \\"great-granddaddy of the soap operas\\" by radio historian Francis Chase, Jr. One of the other shows that helped pioneer the daytime soap opera/serial was The Guiding Light, which debuted on NBC radio in 1937, and then switched to CBS Television in 1952. The Guiding Light final episode aired on September 18, 2009, having a total of 15,762 episodes air on CBS. Some of the characters in soap operas have been portrayed as long-suffering (a common theme even in some of today's serials along with the social and economical issues of the day). Children's adventure serials were more like film serials, with continuing characters involved in exploits with episodes that often ended in a cliffhanger situation; Westerns were a particularly popular format for children's serials on the radio. Guiding Light and such other daytime television program serials such as Search for Tomorrow, Love of Life, The Secret Storm, As the World Turns, The Edge of Night, The Doctors, Another World, Dark Shadows, One Life to Live, and All My Children were popular in the Golden and Silver Ages of television and still are today. Aside from the social issues, the style and presentation of these shows have changed. Whereas in the 1950s and 1960s the drama was underscored with traditional organ music, and in the 1970s and the 1980s a full orchestra provided the score, the daytime dramas of today use cutting-edged synth-driven music (in a way, music for soaps has come full-circle, from the keyboard to the keyboard). The nighttime serials are a different story, though the concept is also nothing new. In the 1960s, ABC aired the first real breakthrough nighttime serial, Peyton Place, inspired by the novel and theatrical film of the same name. After its cancellation, the format went somewhat dormant until Norman Lear produced Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman in 1976. In 1977, ABC created another comedy soap (aptly called Soap). Although the show was controversial for its time (with a homosexual character among its cast roster), it was (and still is today) a cult classic. The success of Dallas popularized serial storylines on prime-time television. Its end-of-season cliffhangers, such as \\"Who shot J. R.?\\" and \\"Bobby in the Shower?\\", influenced other shows like Dynasty (ABC's answer to Dallas), Knots Landing, Falcon Crest, The Colbys, Flamingo Road, Hotel, The Yellow Rose, Bare Essence, and Berrenger's. There were some serial shows such as Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere that did not officially fit into this category, but were nonetheless ratings hits season after season. While the last of the 1980s nighttime soaps ended during the first years of the following decade, then a second wave came with series like Beverly Hills, 90210, Melrose Place, Models, Inc., Savannah and Central Park West. But as the 1990s came to a close, the primetime soap as an official format gradually faded away, where it largely seems to remain as of the middle of the first decade of the 21st century in the United States. Other dramas Serialized storytelling can also be seen in other dramas. Heavily serialized dramas include Star Trek Deep Space Nine, Babylon 5, The Sopranos, Twin Peaks, 24, Battlestar Galactica, Breaking Bad, Dexter, The Wire, and Downton Abbey. Series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Veronica Mars, Homicide: Life on the Streets, The Good Wife, and The X-Files fall somewhere in-between, featuring a new case each week that is solved by the end of the episode, but also having an overarching mystery that receives focus in many episodes. The more serialized its storytelling, the less likely a show is to fare well in repeats. The format places a demand on episodes to be run in order, without which story arcs stretching over many episodes may be difficult for new viewers to delve into. Desperate Housewives also falls into the category while each season involves a new mystery that spans an entire season (and on one occasion, half the season) while planting hints throughout the episodes until the climax in the finale. To a lesser extent, series such as House and Fringe may also feature ongoing story arcs, but episodes are more self-encapsulated and so the series fall into a more conventional drama category. Fringe has experimented with \\"myth-alones\\", a hybrid that attempts to advance the story arc in a self-contained episode. In addition, it has been noted that the use of cliffhangers is still prevalent in adventure shows; however, they are now typically used just before a commercial break and the viewer need only wait a few minutes to see its resolution. In addition, many series have also made extensive use of the traditional end-of-episode cliffhanger format. This is most common in season finales which often end in a cliffhanger that would only be resolved in the next season's premiere. Over the course of its run, a show may change its focus. Matt Cherniss, executive vice president of programming at Fox says: \\"Sometimes early on, being a little more episodic allows more people into the room. And as the show goes on, by its nature, it might find itself becoming a little more serialized.\\" Early in their runs, shows such as Lost, Buffy, Angel, Dollhouse and Torchwood put greater emphasis on the \\"story-of-the-week\\", but over time story arcs begin to dominate. In contrast, Alias became more focused on standalone stories in later seasons, because of pressures by network executives.  Effect of a serial model on commercial success  Complex story arcs may have a negative effect on ratings by making entry more difficult for new viewers as well as confusing fans who have missed an episode. Networks see them as riskier than dramas that focus on a self-contained story of the week. Tom O'Neil of the Los Angeles Times notes: \\"They're chancy because these shows are hard to join midway through.\\" CBS has not aired a serial drama in many years, in part because of the success of its non-serial procedurals. Scott Collins of the Los Angeles Times stated that \\"serialized storytelling ... though popular with hard-core fans and many critics, requires more dedication from viewers and has almost certainly tamped down ratings for many shows\\". He quoted an ad executive who states that close-ended story lines \\"[make] it easier for new viewers to tune in and figure out what's going on\\". According to Dick Wolf, serialized elements also make it more difficult for viewers to return to a show if they have missed some episodes. Cheers co-creator Les Charles regrets helping to make serialization common: \\"[W]e may have been partly responsible for what's going on now, where if you miss the first episode or two, you are lost. You have to wait until you can get the whole thing on DVD and catch up with it. If that blood is on our hands, I feel kind of badly about it. It can be very frustrating.\\" Another problem is that many fans prefer to record these shows and binge watch the whole season in one session. These viewers are not included in TV ratings as they are much less likely to watch commercials than live viewers. The move away from live viewing and toward DVR or internet- streaming services has hurt many shows' prospects because there are fewer or no commercials and they may be fast-forwarded or out-of-date. Concerned about the toll on ratings of complex story arcs, networks sometimes ask showrunners to reduce serialization. Network executives believe that standalone episodes serve as a better jumping on point for new viewers, although this may result in a conflict with regular watchers who tend to prefer more focus on story arcs. Alias began as a more serialized show but later became more stand-alone under network pressure. During season 3 of the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica, showrunner Ronald D. Moore was also pressured to make episodes more stand-alone. This move resulted in negative criticism from both fans and critics, and Moore revealed in the Season 3 finale podcast that the network finally accepted that standalone episodes simply do not work for the story he is trying to tell. Moore has also stated that the network was reluctant to greenlight Caprica mainly because story-arc-heavy series notoriously have difficulty in picking up new viewers, as compared to a series composed of mostly standalone episodes.Battlestar Galactica Season 3 Companion According to Todd A. Kessler, the second season of Damages will be less serialized in order to render the show more accessible to new viewers. Tim Kring, creator of Heroes, has also suggested that his show may move away from serialized storytelling: \\"I think the show needs to move towards [standalone episodes] in order to survive.\\" Networks also discourage complex story arcs because they are less successful in reruns, and because standalone episodes can be rerun without concern for order. Entertainment Weekly and Chicago Tribune have expressed concern that declining ratings may lead to a major reduction in serialized storytelling. To highlight the situation, in the 2006‚Äì2007 season, no fewer than five high-concept serials were introduced, including Jericho, Kidnapped, Vanished, The Nine, and Drive, all of which experienced fairly quick cancellation due to low ratings. In 2010 and 2011, more high-profile, high-cost serials failed to achieve success, including V, The Event, and FlashForward. Some reviewers have also noted that serialized dramas are at a disadvantage at major awards shows such as the Primetime Emmy Awards. Such shows generally have to submit an atypical self-contained episode in order to gain recognition. Despite this, since 2000, every winner of the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series has been a Serial Drama: The West Wing (2000‚Äì2003), The Sopranos (2004, 2007), Lost (2005), 24 (2006), Mad Men (2008‚Äì2011), Homeland (2012), Breaking Bad (2013‚Äì2014), Game of Thrones (2015-2016), and The Handmaid's Tale (2017). In terms of DVD sales, however, strongly serialized shows often perform better than shows which are strongly procedural. 24 (Season 6), Lost (Season 4), Heroes (Season 2), True Blood and even ratings minnow Battlestar Galactica (Season 4.0) sell significantly more units than hit procedurals such as CSI (Season 6), NCIS (Season 3, Season 5), CSI: Miami (Season 4, Season 5) and Criminal Minds (Season 2, Season 3). Serialized shows tend to develop a more dedicated fanbase interested in exploring the show online as well as becoming customers of additional merchandising.

An early charter to Llanllugan nunnery was issued by Maredudd ap Rhobert, Lord of Cedewain, probably some time in the early thirteenth century.Maredudd's charter provided the nuns with their core estates in the township of Llanllugan between the two streams of the Rhiw. The abbey's other estates include Hydan grange in Castle Caereinion and Cowney in Llangadfan. Llanllugan also received income from appropriated churches, the rectory of Llanfair Caereinion was granted by Bishop Hugh of St Asaph in 1239 and Llanllwchairan by Bishop Anian of St Asaph in 1263. It was founded as a dependency of the Cistercian monks at the Abbey of Strata Marcella. The former monastery church survives as the parish church of Llanllugan. However, the site of the abbey buildings remains uncertain: they might have been in a meadow 200 metres to the south of the church. The Princes of Wales founded a number of Cistercian monasteries in that period, which were independent of the ones founded in Norman England, at a time Norman forces were pushing their way into that region. As a result, these houses were nominally allied with the native Welsh nobility. The abbey is famous in Welsh literature from a poem by the leading poet Dafydd ap Gwilym entitled Cyrchu Lleian ():Rachel Bromwich, Selected Poems of Dafydd ap Gwilym, Penguin, 1985, , p 53 In the poem, Dafydd implores his anonymous messenger to travel to 'proud Llanllugan' and entice one of the nuns from the convent to the forest grove. It has been suggested that the abbey was small: only four nuns and an abbess were recorded in 1377. Dafydd's poem (written before the Black Death) suggests there were some 60 nuns at that time; however the figure should be taken as poetic license, as the two Welsh communities of Cistercian nuns rarely seem to have had more than a dozen members each.

They released their debut single, \\"Love Will Find a Way\\" in October, which peaked into the top 40 of the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. Their self-titled debut album, The Reels, produced by Mark Opitz (The Angels, Cold Chisel) had appeared in November.

Australian rock music historian, Ian McFarlane claimed, \\"the album's highlight was the sparse, evocative title track\\". In 1983 the band travelled to the United States and United Kingdom, and released a five track EP, Pitt Street Farmers and followed with an updated version of \\"Quasimodo's Dream\\" in December, which demonstrated the band's faith in the song, although it failed to chart on its second release.

The instalments are also known as numbers, parts or fascicles, and may be released either as separate publications or within sequential issues of a periodical publication, such as a magazine or newspaper. Serialisation can also begin with a single short story that is subsequently turned into a series. Historically, such series have been published in periodicals. Popular short stories series are often published together in book form as collections.  Early history  The growth of moveable type in the 17th century prompted episodic and often disconnected narratives such as L'Astr√©e and Le Grand Cyrus. At that time, books remained a premium item, so to reduce the price and expand the market, publishers produced large works in lower-cost instalments called fascicles. These had the added attraction of allowing a publisher to gauge the popularity of a work without incurring the expense of a substantial print run of bound volumes: if the work was not a success, no bound volumes needed to be prepared. If, on the other hand, the serialised book sold well, it was a good bet that bound volumes would sell well, too.  19th and early 20th centuries  Serialized fiction surged in popularity during Britain's Victorian era, due to a combination of the rise of literacy, technological advances in printing, and improved economics of distribution. Most Victorian novels first appeared as installments in monthly or weekly periodicals. The wild success of Charles Dickens's The Pickwick Papers, first published in 1836, is widely considered to have established the viability and appeal of the serialized format within periodical literature. During that era, the line between \\"quality\\" and \\"commercial\\" literature was not distinct. Other famous writers who wrote serial literature for popular magazines were Wilkie Collins, inventor of the detective novel with The Moonstone and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories originally for serialization in The Strand magazine. While American periodicals first syndicated British writers, over time they drew from a growing base of domestic authors. The rise of the periodicals like Harper's and the Atlantic Monthly grew in symbiotic tandem with American literary talent. The magazines nurtured and provided an economic sustainability for writers, while the writers helped grow the periodicals' circulation base. During the late 19th century, those that were considered the best American writers first published their work in serial form and then only later in a completed volume format. As a piece in Scribner's Monthly explained in 1878, \\"Now it is the second or third rate novelist who cannot get publication in a magazine, and is obliged to publish in a volume, and it is in the magazine that the best novelist always appears first.\\" Among the American writers that wrote in serial form were Henry James and Herman Melville. A large part of the appeal for writers at the time was the broad audiences that serialization could reach, which would then grow their following for published works. One of the first significant American works to be released in serial format is Uncle Tom's Cabin, by Harriet Beecher Stowe, which was published over a 40-week period by The National Era, an abolitionist periodical, starting with the June 5, 1851 issue. Serialization was so standard in American literature that authors from that era often built installment structure into their creative process. James, for example, often had his works divided into multi-part segments of similar length. The consumption of fiction during that time was different than in the 20th century. Instead of being read in a single volume, a novel would often be consumed by readers in installments over a period as long as a year, with the authors and periodicals often responding to audience reaction. In France, Alexandre Dumas and Eug√®ne Sue were masters of the serialized genre. The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo each appeared as a feuilleton. The Count of Monte Cristo was stretched out to 139 installments. Eug√®ne Sue's serial novel Le Juif errant increased circulation of Le Constitutionnel from 3,600 to 25,000. Production in book form soon followed and serialization was one of the main reasons that nineteenth-century novels were so long. Authors and publishers kept the story going if it was successful since authors were paid by line and by episode. Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary was serialized in La Revue de Paris in 1856. Some writers were prolific. Alexandre Dumas wrote at an incredible pace, oftentimes writing with his partner twelve to fourteen hours a day, working on several novels for serialized publication at once. However, not every writer could keep up with the serial writing pace. Wilkie Collins, for instance, was never more than a week before publication. The difference in writing pace and output in large part determined the author's success, as audience appetite created demand for further installments. In the German-speaking countries, the serialized novel was widely popularized by the weekly family magazine Die Gartenlaube, which reached a circulation of 382,000 by 1875.Kirsten Belgum: \\"Domesticating the Reader: Women and Die Gartenlaube\\" in: Women in German Yearbook 9 (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1993) pp. 92-93 In Russia, The Russian Messenger serialized Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina from 1873 to 1877 and Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov from 1879 to 1880. In Poland, Boles≈Çaw Prus wrote several serialized novels: The Outpost (1885‚Äì86), The Doll (1887‚Äì89), The New Woman (1890‚Äì93), and his sole historical novel, Pharaoh (the latter, exceptionally, written entire over a year's time in 1894‚Äì95 and serialized only after completion, in 1895‚Äì96). In addition, works in late Qing dynasty China had been serialized. The Nine-tailed Turtle was serialized from 1906 to 1910. Bizarre Happenings Eyewitnessed over Two Decades was serialized in Xin Xiaoshuo (T: Êñ∞Â∞èË™™, S: Êñ∞Â∞èËØ¥, P: Xƒ´n Xi«éoshu≈ç; W: Hsin Hsiao-shuo; \\"New Fiction\\"), a magazine by Liang Qichao. The first half of Officialdom Unmasked appeared in installments of Shanghai Shijie Fanhua Bao, serialized there from April 1903 to June 1905.  Late 20th and early-21st centuries  With the rise of broadcast‚Äîboth radio and television series‚Äîin the first half of the 20th century, printed periodical fiction began a slow decline as newspapers and magazines shifted their focus from entertainment to information and news. However, some serialization of novels in periodicals continued, with mixed success. The first several books in the Tales of the City series by Armistead Maupin appeared from 1978 as regular installments in San Francisco newspapers. Similar serial novels ran in other city newspapers, such as The Serial (1976; Marin County), Tangled Lives (Boston), Bagtime (Chicago), and Federal Triangle (Washington, D.C.). Starting in 1984, Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities, about contemporary New York City, ran in 27 parts in Rolling Stone, partially inspired by the model of Dickens. The magazine paid $200,000 for his work, but Wolfe heavily revised the work before publication as a standalone novel. Alexander McCall Smith, author of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, experimented in 2004 with publishing his novel 44 Scotland Street in instalments every weekday in The Scotsman. Michael Chabon serialized Gentlemen of the Road in The New York Times Magazine in 2007. The emergence of the World Wide Web prompted some authors to revise a serial format. Stephen King experimented with The Plant (2000), and Michel Faber allowed The Guardian to serialise his novel The Crimson Petal and the White. In 2005, Orson Scott Card serialized his out-of-print novel Hot Sleep in the first issue of his online magazine, InterGalactic Medicine Show. In 2008 McCall Smith wrote a serialized online novel Corduroy Mansions, with the audio edition read by Andrew Sachs made available at the same pace as the daily publication. In 2011, pseudonymous author Wildbow published Worm, which remains one of the most popular web serials of all time. The rise of fan fiction on the internet also follows a serial fiction style of publication, as seen on websites such as FanFiction.Net and Archive of Our Own (AO3). Many aspiring authors also used the web to publish free-to-read works in serialized format independently as well as web-based communities such as LiveJournal, Fictionpress.com, fictionhub, and Wattpad. Many of these books receive as many readers as successful novels; some have received the same number of readers as New York Times bestsellers. In addition, the prevalence of mobile devices made the serial format even more popular with the likes of JukePop Serials,JukePop Serials and Serial Box, with iOSJukePop Serials (iOS) and AndroidJukePop Serials (Android) apps that focuses entirely on curating and promoting serialized novels.

Varieties that produce few leaves and flowers over a shorter period are classed as determinate and those that produce new leaves and flowers for longer are classed as indeterminate. Tomatoes Determinate, or bush, types bear a full crop all at once and top off at a specific height; they are often good choices for container growing. Determinate types are preferred by commercial growers who wish to harvest a whole field at one time, or home growers interested in canning. Indeterminate cultivars develop into vines that never top off and continue producing until killed by frost. They are preferred by home growers who wish ripe fruit throughout the season. As an intermediate form, there are plants sometimes known as \\"vigorous determinate\\" or \\"semi- determinate\\"; these top off like determinates but produce a second crop after the initial crop.

In 1803, Napoleon bestowed the office of Prince-elector to Charles Frederick, but in 1806, Francis II dissolved the Empire. Baden then achieved sovereignty, and Charles Frederick became Grand Duke. History The French Revolution began in 1789, and at its onset the Margraviate of Baden was united under Charles Frederick, but it did not form a compact territory. Its total area was only about , consisting of a number of isolated districts lying on either bank of the upper Rhine. Charles Frederick endeavored to acquire the intervening stretches of land, so as to give territorial unity to his country. His opportunity to do so came during the French Revolutionary Wars. When war broke out between the French First Republic and the Holy Roman Empire in 1792, the Margraviate of Baden fought for the House of Habsburg. However, their country was devastated as a result, and in 1796 the Margrave was compelled to pay an indemnity and to cede his territories on the left bank of the Rhine to the French First Republic. Fortune, however, soon turned his way. With the German Mediatisation of 1803, and largely owing to the good offices of Alexander I of Russia, Charles Frederick received the Bishopric of Constance, part of the Electorate of the Palatinate, and other smaller districts, together with the prestige of being named a Prince-elector. In 1805 he changed sides and fought for Napoleon. As a result, later in 1805, when the Peace of Pressburg occurred, he obtained Breisgau and other territories at the expense of the Austrian Empire (see Further Austria). In 1806, the Electorate of Baden signed the Rheinbundakte, joining the Confederation of the Rhine. Upon the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Charles Frederick declared sovereignty and thus created the Grand Duchy of Baden, receiving other territorial additions as well. In 1806, Charles Frederick joined the Confederation of the Rhine, declared himself a sovereign prince, became a grand duke, and received additional territory. The Baden contingent continued to assist France, and by the Peace of Vienna in 1809, Charles Frederick was rewarded with accessions of territory at the expense of the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. Having quadrupled the area of Baden, Charles Frederick died in June 1811, and was succeeded by his grandson, Charles, Grand Duke of Baden, who was married to St√©phanie de Beauharnais (1789‚Äì1860), a cousin of Empress Josephine's first husband who had been adopted by Napoleon I.

He was introduced to spying and military service in World War II, and made this his career path after the war as well. He was mayor of Bardu and a three-term member of the Parliament of Norway. Early life He was born in S√∏r-Varanger as a son of fisherman Martin Henningsen (1873‚Äì1954) and his wife Hilda Marie Rydning (1888‚Äì1964). He had a politicized childhood, and Ellisif Wessel was a family friend. He became politically active in the interwar period and joined the Workers' Youth League. He finished middle school in 1937, and enrolled at the Norwegian 6th Division Under-Officers' Training School in 1938. From 1943 he attended a teacher's college in Troms√∏. World War II At that time Norway was occupied by Germany as a part of World War II. Together with Torstein Raaby, Henningsen was recruited as a Soviet spy with connections to Murmansk. It only took a few months before the Gestapo tracked them down, and they both had to flee the country. Via Sweden, Henningsen went to England where he received telegraphy training as well as commando-style training in melee combat. In total he had four stays in Norway. One time he barely survived a submarine wrecking. On the last journey he participated in the liberation of Northern Norway, where Norwegian troops cooperated with the Red Army. The Germans used the scorched earth tactic as they retreated south. One day, Henningsen travelled down the Porsangerfjord in a small boat, which German troops managed to board. After discarding the radio transmitter, Henningsen plunged into the water, was shot, managed to swim ashore but was captured here and taken prisoner-of-war. He spent some weeks imprisoned at Akershus Fortress before Victory in Europe Day. In 1945 he was decorated with the Defence Medal 1940‚Äì1945, the St. Olav's Medal With Oak Branch and British decorations. Two Russian decorations followed in 1968 and 1994. Post-war life After the war his career took a military path. He served as aide-de-camp in Finnmark from 1947 to 1948 and captain in Troms from 1948 to 1954, except for 1950 to 1951 when he served in the Independent Norwegian Brigade Group in Germany. He headed Infantry Regiment 16 (IR16) from 1954 to 1956, and was then promoted to lieutenant colonel and head of the local Home Guard. He retired from that position in 1974. Henningsen became acquainted with Thor Heyerdahl during the liberation of Northern Norway, and in 1947 he was asked to join the Heyerdahl- led Kon-Tiki expedition. He declined due to his forthcoming marriage. Torstein Raaby was chosen instead. Politics Henningsen was mayor of Bardu municipality during the terms 1955-1959, 1959-1962 and 1975-1979\\\\. From 1955 to 1962 he was also a member of Troms county council. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway from Troms in 1961, and was re-elected on two occasions. His main political interest lay in improving the communication systems in Troms county. He received some attention in his 1961 electoral campaign when he fell off a wharf on the island of Senja. Henningsen has stated that he originally was uninterested in Parliament, but accepted the party nomination when it came. He has referred to the Parliament as \\"the loony bin\\", and was reputed for not following the political mainstream. In 1972 he supported the possible Norwegian membership in the European Communities, against the overwhelming opinion of his county Troms. His reasoning was grounded in uniting Europe to avoid more conflicts. In 1983 he resigned his membership in the Labour Party. He also had a rather unsuccessful attempt to import muskox to Troms, serving as board chairman of the company Norsk Moskus from 1969 to 1980. He was also a board member of Nordisk Polarinvest from 1983 to 1988 and executive of the Svea-based company Tundra from 1984 to 1988. In 1989 the book Partisan og politiker was released; told by Alfred Henningsen and penned by Hans Christian Finstad. He has resided in Setermoen since 1951. He died at Barduheimen in September 2012.

Early life  Hyde was born to a British father and a Finnish mother in Colchester, England. Career Hyde studied in London at Drama Studio London and East 15 Acting School. She continued her singing work by taking singing lessons in Jazz and forties popular cabaret standards. Early theatre work in Finland started in 2001 when she returned to Finland after receiving an offer from the Joensuu City Theatre. Since then she has worked in the city theatres of Helsinki, Joensuu, and Espoo. Since 2005 she has been performing regularly at Helsinki City Theatre. The film drama \\"Pihalla\\" (known as \\"Playground\\" in Germany), in which she plays Riina, was released in October 2009. She was picked out, along with Mikko Leppilampi, by Helsingin Sanomat for special praise though the film itself received mainly poor reviews. The political and media satire \\"Koljatti\\" opened on 30 September 2010 at Helsinki City Theatre, in which she played Riikka Tanner, assistant to the prime minister. Political satire in theatre is new to Finland and the production was something of a groundbreaker in the deferential Finnish political climate. The play was immediately heavily criticised by the leading Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat. In 2010, Hyde was also in the popular Arsenikkia ja vanhoja pitsej√§ (Arsenic and Old Lace) as the sole female in the cast, as the two female roles were played by men. Her third production currently running was the comedy for children \\"Risto R√§pp√§√§j√§\\". Both plays can be categorised as family entertainments.

They occupied a site on Leeds Road which was later occupied by the Don Valley sports stadium. The firm was founded by George Brown, Nephew of \\"John Brown\\" of the firm John Brown & Company. The firm manufactured Bessemer steel and railway tracks.A Photographic History of Sheffield Steel,by Geoffrey Howse, published by WH Smith, Notable among its employees was Harry Brearley, the inventor of stainless steel. Brearley left Firths after a dispute over the patents and was offered a position at Brown Bayley, where he was appointed works manager and then became a director. The Brown Bayley steelworks, The company occupied a site. \\"View of a 1950s Engineering Apprentice\\"; The melting shop Scrap steel loaded by overhead cranes using electromagnetic grabs fed the Siemens Martin Open hearth furnaces via charging machines tipping ‚Äúcoffin‚Äù-like loading containers directly into the furnaces. The furnaces were heated by water gas and producer gas made on site fed to the furnaces by gas mains. The molten metal had alloys added, then sampled and after satisfactory laboratory checks of the metal composition the furnaces were tapped out into preheated bottom pouring ladles holding some 20 tons. The ladles were manoeuvred by overhead crane into the casting bays over several ceramic runner systems each feeding six preheated one-ton ingot moulds. After cooling the ingot moulds were stripped of the still hot ingots and taken to the ingot yard. In the 1950s the transport from the Open Hearth Casting Bays to the ingot yard was by steam lorry, or on the internal steam railway system. As of 2016, a fully restored original example of one of the steam lorries carrying the Brown Bayley livery can be found at the Riverside Museum in Glasgow. After cooling and weathering selected ingots would be transported to the machine shop where they were placed on ingot planning machines to remove the outer-scaled surface and allow examination for cracks and impurities. Impurities were gouged out with chisels using pneumatic ‚Äúchipping hammers‚Äù or by manually operated swing frame grinding. Electromagnets carried ingots to the skid pusher behind the reheat furnaces of No.1 Mill. These furnaces were again heated by on site- produced raw coal gas. No1 Mill No1 Mill was a reversing cogging mill driven by a several hundred horsepower electric motor through a Krupp gearbox. The cogging stand reduced the section ingot to either slab or bar of section. All hot material was moved at ground level on live roller paths. The second and third stands reduced material to either square or round bar of section, or plate of section. The first stand had a hydraulic manipulator, which turned the material for rolling and also aligned it with a hydraulic accumulator driven hot shear, which cut off the red-hot ingot runner head of section in 3 seconds. The manipulator then aligning the ingot with the reducing rolls making several passes to make the required section. After rolling to the ordered section the red hot steel ran along ground level live roller paths to the hot saws or hot shears. The hot saws had a carbon steel saw blade similar to a woodworkers circular saw, but running with a constant cooling water spray to the teeth. These hot saws were capable of slicing through bar in seconds with showers of sparks and the screaming metal emitting a noise of 110 decibels. Hot shears also cropped the bar to length, but left indentations in the end of the bars, where hot sawing left a straight, clean cut. The bars were then lowered into cooling pits before being taken to heat treatment and bar-straightening machines. Round bar straightening was done in machines known then as ‚ÄúReelers‚Äù with a convex and concave roller paired together at an angle, the action of which both straightened and fed the bar whilst passing it through the machine. Again the entry chute to the machine was a lidded box built to contain the flailing bent bars which emitted a very loud rattling noise. Special steels Electric arc furnaces also produced steels using scrap from ‚ÄúT‚ÄôTop Bank‚Äù many tons of armaments arrived at the Top Bank for melting down Oerlikon and other anti aircraft guns arriving by rail for destruction into steel for peaceful use. Two high-frequency electric furnaces produced one-ton melts of special steels in an area close to the main electric arc furnaces. No6 Mill No6 Mill was a three-high rolling mill with several stands (Sets of Rolls) producing bar down to thick wire sizes from red hot billets taken from the reheat furnaces. The small diameter rod and bar produced in this mill snaked all over the cast iron floor plates. The operators used tongs to catch hold of the end of the red hot bar as it left the rolls, passed the bar around their body allowing it to loop out onto the floor and then entered the bar into the next pass position. In one hot summer the floor plates expanded, the expansion could not go anywhere and two plates buckled upwards like flagstones directing the hot metal into the air ‚Äì within milliseconds there was no one on the mill floor as the metal reared up towards the roof and collapsed in a writhing heap as the mill rollers continued to spew out the rest of the bar.

File:Ulmus pumila leaves.jpgFoliage of Siberian Elm in Alma Park, St Kilda, Victoria Cultivation The history of elms in Australia extends back to at least 1803 when Governor King included them in a list of plants dispatched from England. In 1845 two elms, Ulmus campestris and Ulmus suberosa were listed in a nursery catalogue of James Dickson in Hobart. Historically, most planting of elms has occurred in south-eastern Australia, including the states of New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia. The largest number of elm species are found in Victoria. The most common species found in older parks and gardens are the English elm and the Dutch elm. In Melbourne, boulevard plantings of elms were established from the latter half of the nineteenth century in Royal Parade, Victoria Parade and within the Fitzroy Gardens, and are registered as significant by the National Trust of Victoria. In many of the larger towns and cities in Victoria, the planting of elms in avenue plantings began to become popular in the late nineteenth century, a notable example being the 1876 planting in Finlay Avenue in Camperdown. Following World War I, Avenues of Honour were established to commemorate those who served and died. Although a variety of exotic species were utilised, the avenues at Ballarat (22 kilometres long), Bacchus Marsh, Creswick, Newstead, Wallan and Traralgon were either primarily or exclusively planted with English Elm and Dutch elms. In 1997, there were 33,789 elms on council-controlled land within the state and the amount on private land was estimated to be at least as many. In 2005, the City of Melbourne recorded that it had 6300 elms in its parks and boulevards. In 1997 the amenity value of the elms in Melbourne's boulevards was estimated to be $39 million. In New South Wales, elms are predominantly found in Bowral, Orange, Bathurst, Wagga Wagga and Albury. They have also widely planted in Canberra. In Tasmania many older towns in the Midlands and around the eastern coast such as Hobart Launceston, Ross, Port Arthur have plantings in parks and gardens. South Australia's elms are found in the Barossa Valley and Mount Gambier in the various Botanic Gardens. Elms are relatively uncommon in Western Australia and Queensland. File:Elms_Avenue,_Park_17,_Adelaide_Park_Lands.jpgThe elm carriageway in South Park Lands, Adelaide, South Australia'Historic Elm Carriage Way - Tuthangga', adelaidecityexplorer.com.au Naturalisation A number of elm species have become naturalised, predominantly in localised areas. Dutch elm has become naturalised in South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria, and Tasmania, Chinese elm in Queensland, New South Wales (including the Kosciuszko National Park) and Victoria, and Ulmus minor in the ACT. English Elm is naturalised in South Australia and Victoria and has been recorded as naturalised in Porongurup National Park in Western Australia in 1987 and also in Armidale and Wollombi in New South Wales. Pests and diseases Although elms in Australia exist far away from their natural habitat and associated pest and disease problems, a few problematic insect species have managed to infiltrate Australia's strict quarantine defences . The elm leaf beetle was first discovered on the Mornington Peninsula in 1989 and had spread to the City of Melbourne by 1991. The beetles have caused significant damage to elm species since that time, although the City of Melbourne keeps them in check with a regular spraying regime. Another less serious insect pest is the elm tree leafhopper, which causes speckling of leaves resulting in a silvery appearance. Unlike most other countries that have elm trees, Australia has not yet been subjected to Dutch Elm Disease, although the vector of the disease, the elm bark beetle, was first officially recorded in Melbourne in 1974. The City of Melbourne and the Victorian State Government have jointly developed a Dutch elm disease contingency plan in case of an outbreak. Other diseases include Bacterial Wetwood, various viral and fungal diseases, cankers including Coral Spot, and root diseases caused by cinnamon fungus or honey fungus.  Raising community awareness  The Friends of the Elms Inc. (FOTE), is a voluntary not-for-profit organisation which was founded in 1990 for the purpose of raising awareness of the importance of Elms and assisting to fund research into the potential threats of pests and disease. FOTE is dedicated to raising community awareness of the threats to Australia‚Äôs elms, and assisting individuals and local councils in the recording and monitoring of elm trees on both public and private land. FOTE also raises funds to support research into ways to combat insect attack, Elm Leaf Beetle, and prevent the spread of Dutch Elm Disease if it arrives in Australia. It encourages the public to register elm trees that they see around their neighbourhood. Once an elm tree has been positively identified, it is added to the National Register of Elms.

It is one of three choral foundation schools in the city and educates choristers of Christ Church Cathedral, and the Chapels of Worcester College and Pembroke College. It is a member of the IAPS and the Choir Schools Association. History Now a Church of England School, it was originally housed within the College itself. Today its premises are located across from Christ Church at 3 Brewer Street and Cardinal Wolsey's house is still used for teaching. In the 19th century, the Dean of Christ Church, Henry Liddell (father of Alice, who was immortalised in the books of Lewis Carroll) arranged for the building of a new choir school on its present site. In 1938, Wilfrid Oldaker took over as headmaster, finding a school with only nineteen boarders, and set out to enlarge it, roughly trebling the school's size in five years. He was resisted in this by the Dean and Chapter, who did not want a larger prep school on their hands. Oldaker made other big changes, such as joining the IAPS, which meant preparing all boys for Common Entrance, appointing prefects, dividing the school into houses called Wolsey, Aldridge, and Carroll, and introducing the teaching of Greek. In 1939, he launched a school magazine called The Cardinal's Hat.Richard Lane, Michael Lee, The History of Christ Church Cathedral School, Oxford (2017), pp. 52‚Äì64 In 1945, Oldaker moved on to King's School, Canterbury, with Oxford seeing the move as being caused by the Dean and Chapter giving him little support in his development plans.The Public and Preparatory Schools Year Book (Year Book Press Limited, 1954), pp. 100, 103 More recent developments include the opening of a Pre-Prep department and nursery, and the William Walton Centre which comprises several classrooms and teaching facilities.

The school opened a pre-preparatory department in 1984 and a nursery in 1998. The school today All pupils are boys, except a small number of girls in the nursery. The 22 boarders are choristers or probationary choristers for the Cathedral. The dormitories in which they sleep are named after distinguished former organists including Ley, Taverner, Armstrong and Harwood. All other pupils are day boys, among them eighteen choristers who sing in Worcester College Chapel. The school used to provide choristers for Exeter College but this ended when Exeter established a mixed choir. In addition to the focus on Music, there is also a distinguished tradition of Art, and the school contributes an annual exhibition to Oxford's Artweeks festival. Artweeks website. Leavers typically move on to local schools such as Magdalen College School, Oxford, Abingdon School, St Edward's School, Oxford, Bloxham School and D'Overbroeck's College Leckford Place. There is also a tradition of choristers winning Music Scholarships to destinations further afield, which in recent years have included Harrow School, Uppingham School, Eton College, Sherborne School and Wellington College.2010 Notable headmasters * Wilfrid Oldaker, 1938 to 1945 Notable alumni * Simon Carrington ‚Äî conductor and founding member of the a cappella group King's Singers * Joscelyn Godwin ‚Äî musicologist * Crispin Nash-Williams ‚Äî mathematicianD.

Joseph, its foundation stone was laid on 7 June 1877 by Leopold de Rothschild in the presence of the Chief Rabbi, Dr. Nathan Marcus Adler, and the building was formally opened on 30 March 1879. Chaim Weizmann, the first president of the State of Israel, and Herbert Samuel, the British High Commissioner for Palestine during the British Mandate, were both members of the synagogue. Their seats are marked with plaques. The synagogue's first rabbi was Simeon Singer, who translated and edited the Authorised Daily Prayer Book, which is still used in Orthodox synagogues across Great Britain. Perhaps the best known rabbi of New West End Synagogue was Louis Jacobs, whose ties with the synagogue were severed in what became known as the Jacobs affair, and who went on to found the Masorti movement. In August 2007, the New West End Synagogue was declared a national monument. Community The New West End Synagogue is a constituent of the United Synagogue (Orthodox) and serves the Jewish communities of Bayswater, Notting Hill, Kensington, Hammersmith and West London. Opened in 1879, it has in recent years enjoyed a major communal renaissance under the leadership of Rabbi Geoffrey Shisler and his wife Anne. Rabbi Dr. Moshe Freedman was appointed senior minister for the community in 2015 and Services have been led by Cantor Yohel Heller since 2018. As well as regular services, the synagogue provides regular children's services for the under 5s and over 5s; Hebrew classes for children up to Bar or Bat Mitzvah age; a Mothers & Toddlers Group, regular adult education seminars and lectures; a keep fit group for ladies. There is a social committee; a Guild, which organises a range of lectures, outings and charitable activities; an Israel Group which arranges lectures and briefings on the Middle East by experts from all sides of the political spectrum; a Cares Group, which ensures that elderly and infirm members receive regular contact; and a Friendship Club, which meets monthly for more senior members. Music The New West End has a long heritage of choral music. The first choirmaster was David M. Davis, the compiler of The Voice of Prayer and Praise, known as the Blue Book, and the standard work on Anglo-Jewish minhag (customs). Davis spend 50 years as choirmaster, from 1879. Mosaic Voices, the choir at New West End was founded and is conducted by Michael Etherton, who studied cello at Trinity College of Music and conducting at the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance. He is also Chief Executive of UK Jewish Film. Most of the Mosaic Voices choristers are either professional singers or musicians. The choir's repertoire spans 400 years from works by Salmone di Rossi to new works commissioned by current or recent choristers such as Benjamin Till and Toby Young. Mosaic Voices is currently recording a CD called 'The Blue Book' for release in early 2019. Architecture Interior The building was designed by George Ashdown Audsley and William James Audsley of Liverpool. Their output was primarily Protestant churches, but this project and that for the Old Hebrew Congregation, Prince's Road, Liverpool were two exceptions. Other activities included the publication of books on ornament and Japanese art. Both brothers eventually moved to the New York City area. George became a designer of pipe organs and published notable works on this. The Audsleys were particularly fond of historical ornament from various sources. Their churches were High Victorian Gothic Revival, but their secular buildings and synagogues could feature elements of Egyptian, Greek, Saracenic, and Hindu architecture. Particularly notable is the splendid Torah ark. Designed by Joseph, it closely resembles the ark he designed for Glasgow's Garnethill Synagogue; both arks are raised on platforms, approached by a series of circular marble steps, and project into the room in the form of a multi-domed and arched building.Sharman Kadish, Jewish Heritage in England : An Architectural Guide, English Heritage, 2006, pp. 195‚Äì6.

Description  Long leaves grow from its thick pseudobulbs. The flowers of this species -generally individual- are triangular and grow from the base of the youngest pseudo-bulb and measure between 10 and 15 centimeters. They can vary from being completely white in the Alba variety, passing from different tones of pink to lavender. This purity in color makes them the best candidate as a starting point for Lycaste hybrid formation. The flower's blooming period is between November and April, with its peak being in the end of January and the beginning of February. A mature plant can produce between 4 and 12 flowers during the time of its blooming, which lasts between 6 and 8 weeks. It is a hermaphrodite plant capable of producing millions of seeds inside of a fruit in the form of a capsule. Nevertheless, the necessary conditions for the germination include the presence of a specific fungus, which results in the plant being very scarce whose commercialization is prohibited in Guatemala. Habitat Lycaste skinneri is found in humid forests of Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, being the most abundant in Guatemala. It resides at an average altitude of 1,650 meters above sea level, where it doesn't suffer from the high temperatures during the summer or the low temperatures during the winter. Abundant cloud cover at ground level, elevates the relative humidity during the day and the dry season. It inhabits the branches of woody trees at heights where the lighting conditions are appropriate. It is very sensitive to changes in temperature which range from 27 ¬∞C to 18 ¬∞C at night and the ideal humidity for its development is between 50 and 70 percent. Guatemala's patriotic symbol This orchid, also known as the monja blanca (white nun), is the national flower of the Republic of Guatemala. In 1933, Leticia M. de Southerland, president of the International Exhibition of Flowers, celebrated in Miami Beach, Florida, sent a suggestion to the government of Guatemala that the specimen known as the Lycaste skinneri alba be designated as the national flower. This suggestion was consulted by the president of the Republic, General Jorge Ubico, with various specialists, among them was Ulises Rojas and Mariano Pacheco H. and entities like the National Library and the Society of Geography and History. The Experts took into account the beauty and the rarity of the flower and agreed with the suggestion, so that on the February 11th, 1934, the presidency of the Republic issued a decree giving the monja blanca, the denomination of national flower. On August 9, 1946, during the governance Juan Jose Arevalo, with the purpose of protecting the species from extinction in Guatemala, a government decree was issued that prohibited the collection and export of the species. The same agreement was modified on June 4, 1947 to extend the ban on pseudobulbs and flowers, as well as to include the rest of the species of this botanical family. In 1997, when they began to make 50 cent coins, the monja blanca was used as one of the faces on the new coin. Evolution, phylogeny and taxonomy It was first introduced by George Ure Skinner in Guatemala, where the alba variety is commonly known as the monja blanca and is the national flower of said country.

The conspiracy was drawn up at the beginning of the war, with extensive support from the German Foreign Office, the German consulate in San Francisco, as well as some support from Ottoman Turkey and the Irish republican movement. The most prominent plan attempted to foment unrest and trigger a Pan-Indian mutiny in the British Indian Army from Punjab to Singapore. This plot was planned to be executed in February 1915 with the aim of overthrowing British rule over the Indian subcontinent. The February mutiny was ultimately thwarted when British intelligence infiltrated the Ghadarite movement and arrested key figures. Mutinies in smaller units and garrisons within India were also crushed. Other related events include the 1915 Singapore Mutiny, the Annie Larsen arms plot, the Jugantar‚ÄìGerman plot, the German mission to Kabul, the mutiny of the Connaught Rangers in India, as well as, by some accounts, the Black Tom explosion in 1916. Parts of the conspiracy included efforts to subvert the British Indian Army in the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I. The Indo- German alliance and the conspiracy were the target of a worldwide British intelligence effort, which was successful in preventing further attempts. American intelligence agencies arrested key figures in the aftermath of the Annie Larsen affair in 1917. The conspiracy resulted in the Lahore conspiracy case trials in India as well as the Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy Trial‚Äîat the time the longest and most expensive trial ever held in the United States. This series of events was consequential to the Indian independence movement. Though largely subdued by the end of World War I, it came to be a major factor in reforming the Raj's Indian policy. Similar efforts were made during World War II in Germany and in Japanese-controlled Southeast Asia, where Subhas Chandra Bose formed the Indische Legion and the Indian National Army respectively, and in Italy where Mohammad Iqbal Shedai formed the Battaglione Azad Hindoustan. Background Nationalism had become more and more prominent in India throughout the last decades of the 19th century as a result of the social, economic and political changes instituted in the country through the greater part of the century. The Indian National Congress, founded in 1885, developed as a major platform for loyalists' demands for political liberalisation and for increased autonomy. The nationalist movement grew with the founding of underground groups in the 1890s. It became particularly strong, radical and violent in Bengal and in Punjab, along with smaller but nonetheless notable movements in Maharashtra, Madras and other places of South India. In Bengal the revolutionaries more often than not recruited the educated youth of the urban middle-class Bhadralok community that epitomised the \\"classic\\" Indian revolutionary, while in Punjab the rural and military society sustained organised violence. Indian revolutionary underground Rash Behari Bose, key leader of the Delhi‚ÄìLahore Conspiracy and, later, of the February plot The controversial 1905 partition of Bengal had a widespread political impact. Acting as a stimulus for radical nationalist opinion in India and abroad, it became a focal issue for Indian revolutionaries. Revolutionary organisations like Jugantar and Anushilan Samiti had emerged in the 20th century. Several significant events took place. These included assassinations and attempted assassinations of civil servants, prominent public figures and Indian informants, including one in 1907 aiming to kill the Bengal Lieutenant- Governor Sir Andrew Fraser. Matters came to a head when the 1912 Delhi‚ÄìLahore Conspiracy, led by erstwhile Jugantar member Rash Behari Bose, attempted to assassinate the then Viceroy of India, Charles Hardinge. In the aftermath of this event, the British Indian police made concentrated police and intelligence efforts to destroy the Bengali and Punjabi revolutionary underground. Though the movement came under intense pressure for some time, Rash Behari successfully evaded capture for nearly three years. By the time World War I had begun in Europe in 1914, the revolutionary movement had revived in Punjab and Bengal. In Bengal the movement, with a safe haven in the French base of Chandernagore, had sufficient strength to all but paralyse the state administration. The earliest mention of a conspiracy for armed revolution in India appears in Nixon's Report on Revolutionary Organisation, which reported that Jatin Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin) and Naren Bhattacharya had met the Crown Prince of Germany during the latter's visit to Calcutta in 1912, and obtained an assurance that they would receive supplies of arms and ammunition.Terrorism in Bengal, Compiled and Edited by A.K. Samanta, Government of West Bengal, 1995, Vol. II, p625. At the same time an increasingly strong pan-Islamic movement started developing, mainly in the north and north-west regions of India. With the onset of the war in 1914, the members of this movement formed an important component of the conspiracy. At the time of the partition of Bengal, Shyamji Krishna Varma founded India House in London and received extensive support from notable expatriate Indians including Madam Bhikaji Cama, Lala Lajpat Rai, S. R. Rana, and Dadabhai Naoroji. The organisation ‚Äì ostensibly a residence for Indian students ‚Äì in reality sought to promote nationalist opinion and pro-independence work. India House drew young radical activists of the likes of M. L. Dhingra, V. D. Savarkar, V. N. Chatterjee, M. P. T. Acharya and Lala Har Dayal. It developed links with the revolutionary movement in India and nurtured it with arms, funds and propaganda. The authorities in India banned Indian Sociologist and other literature published by the House as \\"seditious\\". Under V. D. Savarkar's leadership, the House rapidly developed as a centre for intellectual and political activism and as a meeting- ground for radical revolutionaries among Indian students in Britain, earning the moniker \\"The most dangerous organisation outside India\\" from Valentine Chirol. In 1909 in London M. L. Dhingra fatally shot Sir W. H. Curzon Wyllie, political aide-de-camp to the Secretary of State for India. In the aftermath of the assassination, the Metropolitan Police and the Home Office rapidly suppressed India House. Its leadership fled to Europe and to the United States of America. Some (like Chatterjee) moved to Germany; Har Dayal and many others moved to Paris. Organisations founded in the United States and in Japan emulated the example of London's India House. Krishna Varma nurtured close interactions with Turkish and Egyptian nationalists and with Clan na Gael in the United States. The joint efforts of Mohammed Barkatullah, S. L. Joshi and George Freeman founded the Pan-Aryan Association ‚Äî modelled after Krishna Varma's Indian Home Rule Society ‚Äî in New York in 1906. Barkatullah himself had become closely associated with Krishna Varma during a previous stay in London, and his subsequent career in Japan put him at the heart of Indian political activities there. Myron Phelp, an acquaintance of Krishna Varma and an admirer of Swami Vivekananda, founded an \\"India House\\" in Manhattan in New York in January 1908. Amidst a growing Indian student population, erstwhile members of the India House in London succeeded in extending the nationalist work across the Atlantic. The Gaelic American reprinted articles from the Indian Sociologist, while liberal press-laws allowed free circulation of the Indian Sociologist. Supporters could ship such nationalist literature and pamphlets freely across the world. New York increasingly became an important centre for the Indian movement, such that Free Hindustan‚Äî a political revolutionary journal closely mirroring the Indian Sociologist and the Gaelic American published by Taraknath Das‚Äî moved in 1908 from Vancouver and Seattle to New York. Das established extensive collaboration with the Gaelic American with help from George Freeman before it was proscribed in 1910 under British diplomatic pressure. This Irish collaboration with Indian revolutionaries resulted in some of the early but failed efforts to smuggle arms into India, including a 1908 attempt on board a ship called the SS Moraitis which sailed from New York for the Persian Gulf before it was searched at Smyrna. The Irish community later provided valuable intelligence, logistics, communication, media, and legal support to the German, Indian, and Irish conspirators. Those involved in this liaison, and later involved in the plot, included major Irish republicans and Irish-American nationalists like John Devoy, Joseph McGarrity, Roger Casement, √âamon de Valera, Father Peter Yorke and Larry de Lacey. These pre- war contacts effectively set up a network which the German foreign office tapped into as war began in Europe. Ghadar Party An immigrant Punjabi family in America. c. 1900s Large-scale Indian immigration to the Pacific coast of North America took place in the 20th century, especially from Punjab, which faced an economic depression. The Canadian government met this influx with legislation aimed at limiting the entry of South Asians into Canada and at restricting the political rights of those already in the country. The Punjabi community had hitherto been an important loyal force for the British Empire and the Commonwealth. The community had expected that its commitment would be honoured with the same welcome and rights which the British and colonial governments extended to British and white immigrants. The restrictive legislation fed growing discontent, protests and anti-colonial sentiments within the community. Faced with increasingly difficult situations, the community began organising itself into political groups. Many Punjabis also moved to the United States, but they encountered similar political and social problems. Meanwhile, India House and nationalist activism of Indian students had begun declining on the east coast of North America towards 1910, but activity gradually shifted west to San Francisco. The arrival at this time of Har Dayal from Europe bridged the gap between the intellectual agitators in New York and the predominantly Punjabi labour workers and migrants in the west coast, and laid the foundations of the Ghadar movement. Ghadar di gunj, an early Ghadarite compilation of nationalist and socialist literature, was banned in India in 1913. The Ghadar Party, initially the 'Pacific Coast Hindustan Association', was formed in 1913 in the United States under the leadership of Har Dayal, with Sohan Singh Bhakna as its president. It drew members from Indian immigrants, largely from Punjab. Many of its members were also from the University of California at Berkeley including Dayal, Tarak Nath Das, Kartar Singh Sarabha and V.G. Pingle. The party quickly gained support from Indian expatriates, especially in the United States, Canada and Asia. Ghadar meetings were held in Los Angeles, Oxford, Vienna, Washington, D.C., and Shanghai. Ghadar's ultimate goal was to overthrow British colonial authority in India by means of an armed revolution. It viewed the Congress-led mainstream movement for dominion status modest and the latter's constitutional methods as soft. Ghadar's foremost strategy was to entice Indian soldiers to revolt. To that end, in November 1913 Ghadar established the Yugantar Ashram press in San Francisco. The press produced the Hindustan Ghadar newspaper and other nationalist literature. Towards the end of 1913, the party established contact with prominent revolutionaries in India, including Rash Behari Bose. An Indian edition of the Hindustan Ghadar essentially espoused the philosophies of anarchism and revolutionary terrorism against British interests in India. Political discontent and violence mounted in Punjab, and Ghadarite publications that reached Bombay from California were deemed seditious and banned by the Raj. These events, compounded by evidence of prior Ghadarite incitement in the Delhi-Lahore Conspiracy of 1912, led the British government to pressure the American State Department to suppress Indian revolutionary activities and Ghadarite literature, which emanated mostly from San Francisco. Germany and the Berlin Committee With the onset of World War I, an Indian revolutionary group called the Berlin Committee (later called the Indian Independence Committee) was formed in Germany. Its chief architects were C. R. Pillai and V. N. Chatterjee. The committee drew members from Indian students and erstwhile members of the India House including Abhinash Bhattacharya, Dr. Abdul Hafiz, Padmanabhan Pillai, A. R. Pillai, M. P. T. Acharya and Gopal Paranjape. Germany had earlier opened the Intelligence Bureau for the East headed by archaeologist and historian Max von Oppenheim. Oppenheim and Arthur Zimmermann, the State Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the German Empire, actively supported the Berlin committee, which had links with Jatin Mukherjee‚Äî a Jugantar Party member and at the time one of the leading revolutionary figures in Bengal. The office of the t25-member committee at No.38 Wielandstrasse was accorded full embassy status. The German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg authorised German activity against British India as World War I broke out in September 1914. Germany decided to actively support the Ghadarite plans. Using the links established between Indian and Irish residents in Germany (including Irish nationalist and poet Roger Casement) and the German Foreign Office, Oppenheim tapped into the Indo- Irish network in the United States. Har Dayal had helped organise the Ghadar party before his arrest in the United States in 1914. He however jumped bail and made his way to Switzerland, leaving the party and publications in the charge of Ram Chandra Bharadwaj, who became the Ghadar president in 1914. The German consulate in San Francisco was tasked to make contact with Ghadar leaders in California. A naval lieutenant by the name of Wilhelm von Brincken with the help of the Indian nationalist journalist Tarak Nath Das and an intermediary by the name of Charles Lattendorf established links with Bharadwaj. Meanwhile, in Switzerland the Berlin committee was able to convince Har Dayal that organising a revolution in India was feasible. Conspiracy Punjabi Sikhs aboard the Komagata Maru in Vancouver's English Bay, 1914. The Canadian government banned the passengers from landing in Canada and the ship was forced to return to India. The events surrounding the Komagata Maru incident served as a catalyst for the Ghadarite cause. In May 1914, the Canadian government refused to allow the 400 Indian passengers of the ship Komagata Maru to disembark at Vancouver. The voyage had been planned by Gurdit Singh Sandhu as an attempt to circumvent Canadian exclusion laws that effectively prevented Indian immigration. Before the ship reached Vancouver, German radio announced its approach, and British Columbian authorities prepared to prevent the passengers from entering Canada. The incident became a focal point for the Indian community in Canada which rallied in support of the passengers and against the government's policies. After a two-month legal battle, 24 of them were allowed to immigrate. The ship was escorted out of Vancouver by the Protected cruiser and returned to India. On reaching Calcutta, the passengers were detained under the Defence of India Act at Budge Budge by the British Indian government, which made efforts to forcibly transport them to Punjab. This caused rioting at Budge Budge and resulted in fatalities on both sides. Ghadar leaders like Barkatullah and Taraknath Das used the inflammatory passions surrounding the Komagata Maru event as a rallying point and successfully brought many disaffected Indians in North America into the party's fold. The British Indian Army, meanwhile, was contributing significantly to the Allied war effort in World War I. Consequently, a reduced force, estimated to have been 15,000 troops in late 1914, was stationed in India. It was in this scenario that concrete plans for organising uprisings in India were made. In September 1913 a Ghadarite named Mathra Singh visited Shanghai to promote the nationalist cause amongst Indians there, followed by a visit to India in January 1914 when Singh circulated Ghadar literature amongst Indian soldiers through clandestine sources before leaving for Hong Kong. Singh reported that the situation in India as favourable for revolution. By October 1914, many Ghadarites had returned to India and were assigned tasks like contacting Indian revolutionaries and organisations, spreading propaganda and literature, and arranging to get arms into the country. The first group of 60 Ghadarites led by Jawala Singh, left San Francisco for Canton aboard the steamship Korea on 29 August. They were to sail on to India, where they would be provided with arms to organise a revolt. At Canton, more Indians joined, and the group, now numbering about 150, sailed for Calcutta on a Japanese vessel. They were to be joined by more Ghadarites arriving in smaller groups. During September and October, about 300 Indians left for India in various ships like SS Siberia, Chinyo Maru, China, Manchuria, SS Tenyo Maru, SS Mongolia and SS Shinyo Maru. Although the Korea's party itself was uncovered and arrested on arrival at Calcutta, a successful underground network was established between the United States and India, through Shanghai, Swatow, and Siam. Tehl Singh, the Ghadar operative in Shanghai, is believed to have spent $30,000 for helping the revolutionaries to get into India. The Ghadarites in India were able to establish contact with sympathisers within the British Indian Army as well as build networks with underground revolutionary groups. East Asia Efforts had begun as early as 1911 to procure arms and smuggle them into India. When a clear idea of the conspiracy emerged, more earnest and elaborate plans were made to obtain arms and to enlist international support. Herambalal Gupta, who had arrived in the United States in 1914 at the Berlin Committee's directives, took over the leadership of American wing of the conspiracy after the failure of the SS Korea mission. Gupta immediately began efforts to obtain men and arms. While men were in plentiful supply with more and more Indians coming forward to join the Ghadarite cause, obtaining arms for the uprising proved to be more difficult. The revolutionaries started negotiations with the Chinese government through James Dietrich, who held Sun Yat-sen's power of attorney, to buy a million rifles. However, the deal fell through when it was realised that the weapons offered were obsolete flintlocks and muzzle loaders. From China, Gupta went to Japan to try to procure arms and to enlist Japanese support for the Indian independence movement. However, he was forced into hiding within 48 hours when he came to know that the Japanese authorities planned to hand him over to the British. Later reports indicated he was protected at this time by Toyama Mitsuru right-wing political leader and founder of the Genyosha nationalist secret society. The Indian Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, a strong supporter of Pan-Asianism, met Japanese premier Count Terauchi and Count Okuma, a former premier, in an attempt to enlist support for the Ghadarite movement. Tarak Nath Das urged Japan to align with Germany, on the grounds that American war preparation could actually be directed against Japan. Later in 1915, Abani Mukherji‚Äî a Jugantar activist and associate of Rash Behari Bose‚Äî is also known to have tried unsuccessfully to arrange for arms from Japan. The ascendancy of Li Yuanhong to Chinese Presidency in 1916, led to the negotiations reopening through his former private secretary who resided in the United States at the time. In exchange for allowing arms shipments to India via China's borders, China was offered German military assistance and the rights to 10% of any material shipped to India via China. The negotiations were ultimately unsuccessful due to Sun Yat Sen's opposition to an alliance with Germany. Europe and United States Franz von Papen, later the Chancellor of Germany briefly before Hitler's rise to power. Papen was key in organising the arms shipments. The Indian nationalists then in Paris had, with Egyptian revolutionaries, made plans to assassinate Lord Kitchener as early as 1911. These plans were however not implemented. After the war began, this plan was revived, and Har Dayal's close associate Gobind Behari Lal visited Liverpool in March 1915 from New York to put this plan in action. He may also have intended at this time to bomb the docks in Liverpool. However, these plans ultimately failed. Chattopadhyaya also attempted at this time to revive links with the remnants of India House that survived in London, and through Swiss, German and English sympathisers then resident in Britain. Among them were Meta Brunner (a Swiss woman), Vishna Dube (an Indian man) and his common law German wife Anna Brandt, and Hilda Howsin (an English woman in Yorkshire). Chattopadhyaya's correspondences were however traced by censor, leading to the arrest of the cell. Among other plans that were considered at the time were large scale conspiracies in June 1915 to assassinate the Foreign Secretary Lord Grey and War minister Lord Kitchener. In addition, they also intended to target the French President Raymond Poincar√© and Prime Minister Ren√© Viviani, King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and his Prime Minister Antonio Salandra. These plans were coordinated with the Italian anarchists, with explosives manufactured in Italy. Barkatullah, by now in Europe and working with the Berlin Committee, arranged for these explosives to be sent to the German consulate in Zurich, from where it was expected to be taken charge of by an Italian anarchist named Bertoni. However, British intelligence was able to infiltrate this plot, and successfully pressed Swiss police to expel Abdul Hafiz. In the United States, an elaborate plan and arrangement was made to ship arms from the country and from the Far East through Shanghai, Batavia, Bangkok and Burma. Even while Herambalal Gupta was on his mission in China and Japan, other plans were explored to ship arms from the United States and East Asia. The German high command decided early on that assistance to the Indian groups would be pointless unless given on a substantial scale. In October 1914, German Vice Consul E.H von Schack in San Francisco approved the arrangements for funds and armaments. $200,000 worth of small arms and ammunition were acquired by the German military attach√© Captain Franz von Papen through Krupp agents, and arranged for its shipment to India through San Diego, Java, and Burma. The arsenal included 8,080 Springfield rifles of Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War vintage, 2,400 Springfield carbines, 410 Hotchkiss repeating rifles, 4,000,000 cartridges, 500 Colt revolvers with 100,000 cartridges, and 250 Mauser pistols along with ammunition. The schooner Annie Larsen and the sailing ship SS Henry S were hired to ship the arms out of the United States and transfer it to the . The ownership of ships were hidden under a massive smokescreen involving fake companies and oil business in south-east Asia. For the arms shipment itself, a successful cover was set up to lead British agents to believe that the arms were for the warring factions of the Mexican Civil War. This ruse was successful enough that the rival Villa faction offered $15,000 to divert the shipment to a Villa- controlled port. Although the shipment was meant to supply the mutiny planned for February 1915, it was not dispatched until June of that year, by which time the conspiracy had been uncovered in India and major leaders had been arrested or gone into hiding. The plot for the shipment itself failed when disastrous co-ordination prevented a successful rendezvous off Socorro Island with the Maverick. The plot had already been infiltrated by British intelligence through Indian and Irish agents linked closely with the conspiracy. Upon returning to Hoquiam, Washington, after several failed attempts, the Annie Larsen's cargo was promptly seized by US customs. The cargo was sold at an auction despite the German Ambassador Count Johann von Bernstoff's attempts to take possession, insisting they were meant for German East Africa. The Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy Trial opened in 1917 in the United States on charges of gun running and at the time was one of the lengthiest and most expensive trials in American legal history. Franz von Papen attempted to sabotage rail lines in Canada and destroy the Welland Canal. He also attempted to supply rifles and dynamite to Sikhs in British Columbia to blast railway bridges. These plots in Canada did not materialise. Among other events in the United States that have been linked to the conspiracy is the Black Tom explosion when, on the night of 30 July 1916, saboteurs blew up nearly 2 million tons of arms and ammunition at the Black Tom terminal at New York harbour awaiting shipment in support of the British war effort. Although blamed solely on German agents at the time, later investigations by the Directorate of Naval Intelligence in the aftermath of the Annie Larsen incident unearthed links between the Black Tom explosion and Franz von Papen, the Irish movement, the Indian movement as well as Communist elements active in the United States. Pan-Indian mutiny By the start of 1915, many Ghadarites (nearly 8,000 in the Punjab province alone by some estimates) had returned to India. However, they were not assigned a central leadership and begun their work on an ad hoc basis. Although some were rounded up by the police on suspicion, many remained at large and began establishing contacts with garrisons in major cities like Lahore, Ferozepur and Rawalpindi. Various plans had been made to attack the military arsenal at Mian Meer, near Lahore and initiate a general uprising on 15 November 1914. In another plan, a group of Sikh soldiers, the manjha jatha, planned to start a mutiny in the 23rd Cavalry at the Lahore cantonment on 26 November. A further plan called for a mutiny to start on 30 November from Ferozepur under Nidham Singh. In Bengal, the Jugantar, through Jatin Mukherjee, established contacts with the garrison at Fort William in Calcutta. In August 1914, Mukherjee's group had seized a large consignment of guns and ammunition from the Rodda company, a major gun manufacturing firm in India. In December 1914, several politically motivated armed robberies to obtain funds were carried out in Calcutta. Mukherjee kept in touch with Rash Behari Bose through Kartar Singh and V.G. Pingle. These rebellious acts, which were until then organised separately by different groups, were brought into a common umbrella under the leadership of Rash Behari Bose in North India, V. G. Pingle in Maharashtra, and Sachindranath Sanyal in Benares. A plan was made for a unified general uprising, with the date set for 21 February 1915. February 1915 The public executions of convicted mutineers at Outram Road, Singapore, c. March 1915 In India, unaware of the delayed shipment and confident of being able to rally the Indian sepoy, the plot for the mutiny took its final shape. Under the plans, the 23rd Cavalry in Punjab was to seize weapons and kill their officers while on roll call on 21 February. This was to be followed by mutiny in the 26th Punjab, which was to be the signal for the uprising to begin, resulting in an advance on Delhi and Lahore. The Bengal cell was to look for the Punjab Mail entering the Howrah Station the next day (which would have been cancelled if Punjab was seized) and was to strike immediately. However, Punjab CID successfully infiltrated the conspiracy at the last moment through a sepoy named Kirpal Singh. Sensing that their plans had been compromised, D-Day was brought forward to 19 February, but even these plans found their way to the intelligence. Plans for revolt by the 130th Baluchi Regiment at Rangoon on 21 January were thwarted. Attempted revolts in the 26th Punjab, 7th Rajput, 130th Baluch, 24th Jat Artillery and other regiments were suppressed. Mutinies in Firozpur, Lahore, and Agra were also suppressed and many key leaders of the conspiracy were arrested, although some managed to escape or evade arrest. A last-ditch attempt was made by Kartar Singh and V. G. Pingle to trigger a mutiny in the 12th Cavalry regiment at Meerut. Kartar Singh escaped from Lahore, but was arrested in Varanasi, and V. G. Pingle was apprehended in Meerut. Mass arrests followed as the Ghadarites were rounded up in Punjab and the Central Provinces. Rash Behari Bose escaped from Lahore and in May 1915 fled to Japan. Other leaders, including Giani Pritam Singh, Swami Satyananda Puri and others fled to Thailand. On 15 February, the 5th Light Infantry stationed at Singapore was among the few units to mutiny successfully. Nearly eight hundred and fifty of its troops mutinied on the afternoon of the 15th, along with nearly a hundred men of the Malay States Guides. This mutiny lasted almost seven days, and resulted in the deaths of 47 British soldiers and local civilians. The mutineers also released the interned crew of the SMS Emden, who were asked by the mutineers to join them but refused and actually took up arms and defended the barracks after the mutineers had left (sheltering some British refugees as well) until the prison camp was relieved. The mutiny was suppressed only after French, Russian and Japanese ships arrived with reinforcements. Of 200 people tried at Singapore, 47 mutineers were shot in public executions, the rest were transported for life to East Africa. Most of the rest were deported for life or given jail terms ranging between seven and twenty years. In all 800 mutineers were either shot imprisoned or exiled Some historians, including Hew Strachan, argue that although Ghadar agents operated within the Singapore unit, the mutiny was isolated and not linked to the conspiracy. Others deem this as instigated by the Silk Letter Movement which became intricately related to the Ghadarite conspiracy. Christmas Day Plot Bagha Jatin, wounded after his final battle at the banks of Burha Balang, off Balasore. His enterprise was deemed one of the most significant threats to British India in autumn 1915. In April 1915, unaware of the failure of the Annie Larsen plan, Papen arranged, through Krupp's American representative Hans Tauscher, a second shipment of arms, consisting of 7,300 Springfield rifles, 1,930.3 pistols, 10 Gatling guns and nearly 3,000,000 cartridges. The arms were to be shipped in mid June to Surabaya in the East Indies on the Holland American steamship SS Djember. However, the intelligence network operated by Courtenay Bennett, the Consul General to New York, was able to trace the cargo to Tauscher in New York and passed the information on to the company, thwarting these plans as well. In the meantime, even after the February plot had been scuttled, the plans for an uprising continued in Bengal through the Jugantar cohort under Jatin Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin). German agents in Thailand and Burma, most prominently Emil and Theodor Helferrich‚Äî brothers of the German Finance minister Karl Helfferich‚Äî established links with Jugantar through Jitendranath Lahiri in March that year. In April, Jatin's chief lieutenant Narendranath Bhattacharya met with the Helfferichs and was informed of the expected arrival of the Maverick with arms. Although these were originally intended for Ghadar use, the Berlin Committee modified the plans, to have arms shipped into India to the eastern coast of India, through Hatia on the Chittagong coast, Raimangal in the Sundarbans and Balasore in Orissa, instead of Karachi as originally decided. From the coast of the Bay of Bengal, these would be collected by Jatin's group. The date of insurrection was fixed for Christmas Day 1915, earning the name \\"The Christmas Day Plot\\". Jatin estimated that he would be able to win over the 14th Rajput Regiment in Calcutta and cut the line to Madras at Balasore and thus take control of Bengal. Jugantar also received funds (estimated to be Rs 33,000 between June and August 1915) from the Helfferich brothers through a fictitious firm in Calcutta. However, it was at this time that the details of the Maverick and Jugantar plans were leaked to Beckett, the British Consul at Batavia, by a defecting Baltic-German agent under the alias \\"Oren\\". The Maverick was seized, while in India, police destroyed the underground movement in Calcutta as an unaware Jatin proceeded according to plan to the Bay of Bengal coast in Balasore. He was followed there by Indian police and on 9 September 1915, he and a group of five revolutionaries armed with Mauser pistols made a last stand on the banks of the river Burha Balang. Seriously wounded in a gun battle that lasted seventy five minutes, Jatin died the next day in the town of Balasore. To provide the Bengal group enough time to capture Calcutta and to prevent reinforcements from being rushed in, a mutiny coinciding with Jugantar's Christmas Day insurrection was planned for Burma with arms smuggled in from neutral Thailand. Thailand (Siam) was a strong base for the Ghadarites, and plans for rebellion in Burma (which was a part of British India at the time) had been proposed by the Ghadar party as early as October 1914, which called for Burma to be used as a base for subsequent advance into India. This Siam-Burma plan was finally concluded in January 1915. Ghadarites from branches in China and United States, including Atma Ram, Thakar Singh, and Banta Singh from Shanghai and Santokh Singh and Bhagwan Singh from San Francisco, attempted to infiltrate Burma Military Police in Thailand, which was composed mostly of Sikhs and Punjabi Muslims. Early in 1915, Atma Ram had also visited Calcutta and Punjab and linked up with the revolutionary underground there, including Jugantar. Herambalal Gupta and the German consul at Chicago arranged to have German operatives George Paul Boehm, Henry Schult, and Albert Wehde sent to Siam through Manila with the purpose of training the Indians. Santokh Singh returned to Shanghai tasked to send two expeditions, one to reach the Indian border via Yunnan and the other to penetrate upper Burma and join with revolutionary elements there. The Germans, while in Manila, also attempted to transfer the arms cargo of two German ships, the Sachsen and the Suevia, to Siam in a schooner seeking refuge at Manila harbour. However, US customs stopped these attempts. In the meantime, with the help of the German Consul to Thailand Remy, the Ghadarite established a training headquarters in the jungles near the Thai-Burma border for Ghadarites arriving from China and Canada. German Consul General at Shanghai, Knipping, sent three officers of the Peking Embassy Guard for training and in addition arranged for a Norwegian agent in Swatow to smuggle arms through. However, the Thai Police high command, which was largely British, discovered these plans and Indian police infiltrated the plot through an Indian secret agent who was revealed the details by the Austrian charg√© d'affaires. Thailand, although officially neutral, was allied closely with Britain and British India. On 21 July, the newly arrived British Minister Herbert Dering presented Foreign Minister Prince Devawongse with the request for arrest and extradition of Ghadarites identified by the Indian agent, ultimately resulting in the arrest of leading Ghadarites in August. Only a single raid into Burma was launched by six Ghadarites, who were captured and later hanged. Also to coincide with the proposed Jugantar insurrection in Calcutta was a planned raid on the penal colony in the Andaman Islands with a German volunteer force raised from East Indies. The raid would release the political prisoners, helping to raise an expeditionary Indian force that would threaten the Indian coast. The plan was proposed by Vincent Kraft, a German planter in Batavia who had been wounded fighting in France. It was approved by the foreign office on 14 May 1915, after consultation with the Indian committee, and the raid was planned for Christmas Day 1915 by a force of nearly one hundred Germans. Knipping made plans for shipping arms to the Andaman islands. However, Vincent Kraft was a double agent, and leaked details of Knipping's plans to British intelligence. His own bogus plans for the raid were in the meantime revealed to Beckett by \\"Oren\\", but given the successive failures of the Indo-German plans, the plans for the operations were abandoned on the recommendations of both the Berlin Committee and Knipping. Afghanistan the Mission with the German and Turkish delegates in Kabul, 1915. Seated to his right is Werner Otto von Hentig. Efforts were directed at drawing Afghanistan into the war on the side of the Central Powers, which it was hoped would incite a nationalist or pan-Islamic uprising in India and destabilise the British recruiting grounds in Punjab and across India. After Russia's defeat in the 1905 Russo-Japanese war, her influence had declined, and it was Afghanistan that was at the time seen by Britain as the only power in the sub-continent capable of directly threatening India. In the spring of 1915, an Indo-German expedition was sent to Afghanistan via the overland route through Persia. Led by the exiled Indian prince Raja Mahendra Pratap, this mission sought to invite the Afghan Emir Habibullah Khan to break with Britain, declare his independence, join the war on the Central side, and invade British India. It managed to evade the considerable Anglo-Russian efforts that were directed at intercepting it in Mesopotamia and in the Persian deserts before it reached Afghanistan in August 1915. In Afghanistan, it was joined in Kabul by members of the pan-Islamic group Darul Uloom Deoband led by Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi. This group had left India for Kabul at the beginning of the war while another group under Mahmud al-Hasan made its way to Hijaz, where they hoped to seek support from the Afghan Emir, the Ottoman Empire and Imperial Germany for a pan-Islamic insurrection beginning in the tribal belt of north-west India. The Indo-German mission pressed Emir Habibullah to break from his neutral stance and open diplomatic relations with Germany, eventually hoping to rally the Emir to the German war effort. Habibullah Khan vacillated on the mission's proposals through much of the winter of 1915, hoping to maintain his neutral stance till the course of the war offered a concrete picture. However, the mission opened at this time secret negotiations with the pro-German elements in the Emir's court and advisory council, including his brother Nasrullah Khan and son Amanullah Khan. It found support among Afghan intellectuals, religious leaders and the Afghan press which rallied with increasingly anti-British and pro- Central articles. By 1916 the Raj was forced to intercept copies of the Afghan newspaper Siraj al Akhbar sent to India. It raised to the Emir a threat of a coup d'√©tat in his country and unrest among his tribesmen, who were beginning to see him as subservient to British authority even as Turkey called for a pan-Islamic Jihad. In December 1915, the Indian members founded the Provisional Government of India, which it was hoped would weigh on Habibullah's advisory council to aid India and force the Emir's hands. In January 1916, the Emir approved a draft treaty with Germany to buy time. However, the Central campaign in the Middle East faltered at around this time, ending hopes that an overland route through Persia could be secured for aid and assistance to Afghanistan. The German members of the mission left Afghanistan in June 1916, ending the German intrigues in the country. Nonetheless, Mahendra Pratap and his Provisional Government stayed behind, attempting to establish links with Japan, Republican China and Tsarist Russia. After the Russian revolution, Pratap opened negotiations with the Soviet Union, visiting Trotsky in Red Petrograd in 1918, and Lenin in Moscow in 1919 and he visited the Kaiser in Berlin in 1918. He pressed for a joint Soviet- German offensive through Afghanistan into India. This was considered by the Soviets for some time after the 1919 coup in Afghanistan in which Amanullah Khan was instated as the Emir and the third Anglo-Afghan war began. Pratap may also have influenced the \\"Kalmyk Project\\", a Soviet plan to invade India through Tibet and the Himalayan buffer states. Middle East Another arm of the conspiracy was directed at the Indian troops who were serving in Middle East. In the Middle Eastern theatre, members of the Berlin Committee, including Har Dayal and M. P. T. Acharya, were sent on missions to Baghdad and Syria in the summer of 1915, tasked to infiltrate the Indian Expeditionary Force in southern Mesopotamia and Egypt and to attempt to assassinate British officers. The Indian effort was divided into two groups, one consisting of a Bengali revolutionary P.N. Dutt (alias Dawood Ali Khan) and Pandurang Khankoje. This group arrived at Bushire, where they worked with Wilhelm Wassmuss and distributed nationalist and revolutionary literature among Indian troops in Mesopotamia and Persia. The other group, working with Egyptian nationalists, attempted to block the Suez Canal. These groups carried out successful clandestine work in spreading nationalist literature and propaganda amongst the Indian troops in Mesopotamia, and on one occasion even bombed an officer's mess. Nationalist work also extended at this time to recruiting Indian prisoners of war in Constantinople, Bushire, Kut-al-Amara. M. P. T. Acharya's own works were directed at forming the Indian National Volunteer Corps with the help of Indian civilians in Turkey, and to recruiting Indian prisoners of war. He is further known to have worked along with Wilhelm Wassmuss in Bushire amongst Indian troops. The efforts were, however, ultimately hampered by differences between the Berlin committee members who were predominantly Hindus, and Indian revolutionaries already in Turkey who were largely Muslims. Further, the Egyptian nationalists distrusted the Berlin Committee, which was seen by the former as a German instrument. Nonetheless, in culmination of these efforts, Indian prisoners of war from France, Turkey, Germany, and Mesopotamia‚Äîespecially Basra, Bushehr, and from Kut al Amara‚Äîwere recruited, raising the Indian Volunteer Corps that fought with Turkish forces on many fronts. The Deobandis, led by Amba Prasad Sufi, attempted to organise incursions to the western border of India from Persia, through Balochistan, to Punjab. Amba Prasad was joined during the war by Kedar Nath Sondhi, Rishikesh Letha and Amin Chaudhry. These Indian troops were involved in the capture of the frontier city of Karman, Uzbekistan and the detention of the British consul there, and also successfully harassed Percy Sykes' Persian campaign against the Baluchi and Persian tribal chiefs who were aided by the Germans. The Aga Khan's brother was killed while fighting the rebels. The rebels also successfully harassed British forces in Sistan in Afghanistan, confining them to Karamshir in Balochistan, and later moving towards Karachi. Some reports indicate they took control of the coastal towns of Gawador and Dawar. The Baluchi chief of Bampur, having declared his independence from British rule, also joined the Ghadarites. But the war in Europe turned for the worse for Turkey and Baghdad was captured by the British forces. The Ghadarite forces, their supply lines starved, were finally dislodged. They retreated to regroup at Shiraz, where they were finally defeated after a bitter fight during the siege of Shiraz. Amba Prasad Sufi was killed in this battle, but the Ghadarites carried on guerrilla warfare along with Iranian partisans until 1919. By the end of 1917, divisions had begun appearing between the Ghadar Party in America on the one hand, and the Berlin Committee and the German high command on the other. Reports from German agents working with Ghadarites in Southeast Asia and the United States clearly indicated to the European wing a significant element of disorganisation, as well as unrealism in gauging public mood and support within the Ghadarite organisation. The failure of the February plot, the lack of bases in Southeast Asia following China's participation in the war in 1917, and the problems of supporting a Southeast Asian operation through the sea stemmed the plans significantly. Infiltration by British agents, change in American attitude and stance, and the changing fortunes of the war meant the massive conspiracy for revolution within India never succeeded. Counter-intelligence British intelligence began to note and track outlines and nascent ideas of the conspiracy by as early as 1911. Incidents like the Delhi-Lahore Conspiracy and the Komagata Maru incident had already alerted the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the existence of a large-scale network and plans for pan-Indian militant unrest. Measures were taken which focussed on Bengal‚Äîthe seat of the most intense revolutionary terrorism at the time‚Äîand on Punjab, which was uncovered as a strong and militant base in the wake of Komagata Maru. Har Dayal's extant group was found to have strong links with Rash Behari Bose, and were \\"cleaned up\\" in the wake of the Delhi bomb case. In Asia At the outbreak of the war, Punjab CID sent teams to Hong Kong to intercept and infiltrate the returning Ghadarites, who often made little effort to hide their plans and objectives. These teams were successful in uncovering details of the full scale of the conspiracy, and in discovering Har Dayal's whereabouts. Immigrants returning to India were double checked against a list of revolutionaries. In Punjab, the CID, although aware of possible plans for unrest, was not successful in infiltrating the conspiracy for the mutiny until February 1915. A dedicated force was formed, headed by the Chief of Punjab CID, and including amongst its members Liaqat Hayat Khan (later head of Punjab CID himself). In February that year, the CID was successful in recruiting the services of Kirpal Singh to infiltrate the plan. Singh, who had a Ghadarite cousin serving in the 23rd Cavalry, was able to infiltrate the leadership, being assigned to work in his cousin's regiment. Singh was soon under suspicion of being a spy, but was able to pass on the information regarding the date and scale of the uprising to British Indian intelligence. As the date for the mutiny approached, a desperate Rash Behari Bose brought forward the mutiny day to the evening of 19 February, which was discovered by Kirpal Singh on the very day. No attempts were made by the Ghadarites to restrain him, and he rushed to inform Liaqat Hayat Khan of the change of plans. Ordered back to his station to signal when the revolutionaries had assembled, Singh was detained by the would-be mutineers, but managed to escape under the cover of answering the call of nature. The role of German or Baltic-German double-agents, especially the agent named \\"Oren\\", was also important in infiltrating and preempting the plans for autumn rebellions in Bengal in 1915 and in as scuttling Bagha Jatin's plans in winter that year. Another source was the German double agent Vincent Kraft, a planter from Batavia, who passed information about arms shipments from Shanghai to British agents after being captured. Maps of the Bengal coast were found on Kraft when he was initially arrested and he volunteered the information that these were the intended landing sites for German arms. Kraft later fled through Mexico to Japan where he was last known to be at the end of the war. Later efforts by Mahendra Pratap's Provisional Government in Kabul were also compromised by Herambalal Gupta after he defected in 1918 and passed on information to Indian intelligence. In Europe and the Middle East By the time the war broke out, the Indian Political Intelligence Office, headed by John Wallinger, had expanded into Europe. In scale this office was larger than those operated by the British War Office, approaching the European intelligence network of the Secret Service Bureau. This network already had agents in Switzerland against possible German intrigues. After the outbreak of the war Wallinger, under the cover of an officer of the British General Headquarters, proceeded to France where he operated from Paris, working with the French political police, the S√ªret√©. Among Wallinger's recruits in the network was Somerset Maugham, who was recruited in 1915 and used his cover as author to visit Geneva while avoiding Swiss interference. Among other enterprises, the European intelligence network attempted to eliminate some of the Indian leaders in Europe. A British agent named Donald Gullick was dispatched to assassinate Virendranath Chattopadhyaya while the latter was on his way to Geneva to meet Mahendra Pratap to offer Kaiser Wilhelm II's invitation. It is said that Somerset Maugham based several of his stories on his first-hand experiences, modelling the character of John Ashenden after himself and Chandra Lal after Virendranath. The short story \\"Giulia Lazzari\\" is a blend of Gullick's attempts to assassinate Virendranath and Mata Hari's story. Winston Churchill reportedly advised Maugham to burn 14 other stories. The Czech revolutionary network in Europe also had a role in the uncovering of Bagha Jatin's plans. The network was in touch with the members in the United States, and may have also been aware of and involved in the uncovering of the earlier plots. The American network, headed by E. V. Voska, was a counter- espionage network of nearly 80 members who, as Habsburg subjects, were presumed to be German supporters but were involved in spying on German and Austrian diplomats. Voska had begun working with Guy Gaunt, who headed Courtenay Bennett's intelligence network, at the outbreak of the war and on learning of the plot from the Czech European network, passed on the information to Gaunt and to Tom√°≈° Masaryk who further passed on the information the American authorities. In the Middle East, British counter- intelligence was directed at preserving the loyalty of the Indian sepoy in the face of Turkish propaganda and the concept of The Caliph's Jihad, while a particularly significant effort was directed at intercepting the Kabul Mission. The East Persian Cordon was established in July 1915 in the Sistan province of Persia to prevent the Germans from crossing into Afghanistan, and to protect British supply caravans in Sarhad from the Damani, Reki and Kurdish Baluchi tribal raiders who may have been tempted by German gold. Among the commanders of the Sistan force was Reginald Dyer who led it between March and October 1916. In the United States In the United States, the conspiracy was successfully infiltrated by British intelligence through Irish and Indian channels. The activities of Ghadar on the Pacific coast were noted by W. C. Hopkinson, who was born and raised in India and spoke fluent Hindi. Initially Hopkinson had been despatched from Calcutta to keep the Indian Police informed about the doings of Taraknath Das. The Home department of the British Indian government had begun the task of actively tracking Indian seditionists on the East Coast as early as 1910. Francis Cunliffe Owen, the officer heading the Home Office agency in New York, had become thoroughly acquainted with George Freeman alias Fitzgerald and Myron Phelps, the famous New York advocate, as members of the Clan-na-Gael. Owens' efforts were successful in thwarting the SS Moraitis plan. The Ghadar Party was incidentally established after Irish Republicans, sensing infiltration, encouraged formation of an exclusively Indian society. Following this, several approaches were adopted, including infiltration through an Indian national named Bela Singh who successfully set up a network of agents passing on information to Hopkinson, and through the use of the famous American Pinkerton's detective agency. Bela Singh was later murdered in India in the 1930s. Hopkinson was assassinated in a Vancouver courthouse by a Ghadarite named Mewa Singh, in October, 1914. Charles Lamb, an Irish double agent, is said to have passed on the majority of the information that compromised the Annie Larsen and ultimately helped the construction of the prosecution. An Indian operative, codenamed \\"C\\" and described most likely to have been the adventurous Chandra Kanta Chakravarty (later the chief prosecution witness in the trial), also passed on the details of the conspiracy to British and American intelligence. Trials The conspiracy led to several trials in India, most famous among them being the Lahore Conspiracy trial, which opened in Lahore in April 1915 in the aftermath of the failed February mutiny. Other trials included the Benares, Simla, Delhi, and Ferozepur conspiracy cases, and the trials of those arrested at Budge Budge. At Lahore, a special tribunal was constituted under the Defence of India Act 1915 and a total of 291 conspirators were put on trial. Of these 42 were awarded the death sentence, 114 transported for life, and 93 awarded varying terms of imprisonment. Several of these were sent to the Cellular Jail in the Andaman Islands. Forty two defendants in the trial were acquitted. The Lahore trial directly linked the plans made in United States and the February mutiny plot. Following the conclusion of the trial, diplomatic effort to destroy the Indian revolutionary movement in the United States and to bring its members to trial increased considerably. In the United States, the Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy Trial commenced in the District Court in San Francisco on 12 November 1917 following the uncovering of the Annie Larsen affair. One hundred and five people participated, including members of the Ghadar Party, the former German Consul-General and Vice-Consul, and other members of staff of the German consulate in San Francisco. The trial itself lasted from 20 November 1917 to 24 April 1918. The last day of the trial was notable for the sensational assassination of the chief accused, Ram Chandra, by a fellow defendant, Ram Singh, in a packed courtroom. Singh himself was immediately shot dead by a US Marshal. In May 1917, eight Indian nationalists of the Ghadar Party were indicted by a federal grand jury on a charge of conspiracy to form a military enterprise against Britain. In later years the proceedings were criticised as being a largely show trial designed to appease the British government. The jury during the trial was carefully selected to exclude any Irish person with republican views or associations. Strong public support in favour of the Indians, especially the revived Anglophobic sentiments following the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles which were perceived as being overtly favorable towards Britain, allowed the Ghadarite movement to be revived despite British concerns. Impact The conspiracy had a significant impact on Britain's policies, both within the empire and in international relations. The outlines and plans for the nascent ideas of the conspiracy were noted and tracked by British intelligence as early as 1911. Alarmed at the agile organisation, which repeatedly reformed in different parts of the country despite being subdued in others, the chief of Indian Intelligence Sir Charles Cleveland was forced to warn that the idea and attempts at pan-Indian revolutions were spreading through India \\"like some hidden fire\\". A massive, concerted, and coordinated effort was required to subdue the movement. Attempts were made in 1914 to prevent the naturalisation of Tarak Nath Das as an American citizen, while successful pressure was applied to have Har Dayal interned. Political impact The conspiracy, judged by the British Indian Government's own evaluation at the time, and those of several contemporary and modern historians, was an important event in the Indian independence movement and was one of the significant threats faced by the Raj in the second decade of the 20th century. In the scenario of the British war effort and the threat from the militant movement in India, it was a major factor for the passage of the Defence of India Act 1915. Among the strongest proponents of the act was Michael O'Dwyer, then the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, and this was largely due to the Ghadarite movement. It was also a factor that guided British political concessions and Whitehall's India Policy during and after World War I, including the passage of Montagu‚ÄìChelmsford Reforms which initiated the first round of political reform in the Indian subcontinent in 1917. The events of the conspiracy during World War I, the presence of Pratap's Kabul mission in Afghanistan and its possible links to the Soviet Union, and a still-active revolutionary movement especially in Punjab and Bengal (as well as worsening civil unrest throughout India) led to the appointment of a Sedition committee in 1918 chaired by Sidney Rowlatt, an English judge. It was tasked to evaluate German and Bolshevik links to the militant movement in India, especially in Punjab and Bengal. On the recommendations of the committee, the Rowlatt Act, an extension of the Defence of India Act 1915, was enforced in India. The events that followed the passage of the Rowlatt Act in 1919 were also influenced by the conspiracy. At the time, British Indian Army troops were returning from the battlefields of Europe and Mesopotamia to an economic depression in India. The attempts of mutiny in 1915 and the Lahore conspiracy trials were still in public attention. News of young Mohajirs who fought on behalf of the Turkish Caliphate and later fought in the ranks of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War was also beginning to reach India. The Russian Revolution had also cast its long shadow into India. It was at this time that Mahatma Gandhi, until then relatively unknown in the Indian political scene, began emerging as a mass leader. Ominously, in 1919, the Third Anglo-Afghan War began in the wake of Amir Habibullah's assassination and institution of Amanullah in a system blatantly influenced by the Kabul mission. In addition, in India, Gandhi's call for protest against the Rowlatt Act achieved an unprecedented response of furious unrest and protests. The situation especially in Punjab was deteriorating rapidly, with disruptions of rail, telegraph and communication systems. The movement was at its peak before the end of the first week of April, with some recording that \\"practically the whole of Lahore was on the streets, the immense crowd that passed through Anarkali was estimated to be around 20,000.\\" In Amritsar, over 5,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh. This situation deteriorated perceptibly over the next few days. Michael O'Dwyer is said to have been of the firm belief that these were the early and ill-concealed signs of a conspiracy for a coordinated uprising around May, on the lines of the 1857 revolt, at a time when British troops would have withdrawn to the hills for the summer. The Amritsar massacre, as well as responses preceding and succeeding it, was the end result of a concerted plan of response from the Punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy. James Houssemayne Du Boulay is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising in the midst of an increasingly tensed situation in Punjab, and the British response that ended in the massacre. Lastly, British efforts to downplay and disguise the nature and impact of the revolutionary movement at this time also resulted in a policy designed to strengthen the moderate movement in India, which ultimately saw Gandhi's rise in the Indian movement. International relations The conspiracy influenced several aspects of Great Britain's international relations, most of all Anglo-American relations during the war, as well as, to some extent, Anglo-Chinese relations. After the war, it was one of the issues that influenced Anglo-Japanese relations. At the start of the war, the American government's refusal to check the Indian seditionist movement was a major concern for the British government. By 1916, a majority of the resources of the American department of the British Foreign Office were related to the Indian seditionist movement. Before the outbreak of the war, the political commitments of the Wilson Government, (especially of Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan who had eight years previously had authored \\"British Rule in India\\", a highly critical pamphlet, that was classified as seditionist by the Indian and Imperial governments), and the political fallouts of the perception of persecution of oppressed people by Britain prevented the then ambassador Cecil Spring Rice from pressing the issue diplomatically. After Robert Lansing replaced Bryan as Secretary of State in 1916, Secretary of State for India Marquess of Crewe and Foreign Secretary Edward Grey forced Spring Rice to raise the issue and the evidences obtained in Lahore Conspiracy trial were presented to the American government in February. The first investigations were opened in America at this time with the raid of the Wall Street office of Wolf von Igel, resulting in seizures of papers that were later presented as evidence in the Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy Trial. However, a perceptibly slow and reluctant American investigation triggered an intense neutrality dispute through 1916, aggravated by belligerent preventive measures of the British Far-Eastern fleet on the high seas that threatened the sovereignty of American vessels. German and Turkish passengers were seized from the American vessel China by HMS Laurentic at the mouth of the Yangtze River. Several incidents followed, including the SS Henry S, which were defended by the British government on grounds that the seized ship planned to foment an armed uprising in India. These drew strong responses from the US government, prompting the US Atlantic Fleet to dispatch destroyers to the Pacific to protect the sovereignty of American vessels. Authorities in the Philippines were more cooperative, which assured Britain of knowledge of any plans against Hong Kong. The strained relations were relaxed in May 1916 when the Britain released the China prisoners and relaxed its aggressive policy seeking co-operation with the United States. However, diplomatic exchanges and relations did not improve before November that year. The conspiracy issue was ultimately addressed by William G. E. Wiseman, head of British intelligence in the United States, when he passed details of a bomb plot directly to the New York Police bypassing diplomatic channels. This led to the arrest of Chandra Kanta Chuckrevarty. As the links between Chuckervarty's papers and the Igel papers became apparent, investigations by federal authorities expanded to cover the entire conspiracy. Ultimately, the United States agreed to forward evidence so long as Britain did not seek admission of liability for breaches of neutrality. At a time that diplomatic relations with Germany were deteriorating, the British Foreign Office directed its embassy to co-operate with the investigations resolving the Anglo-American diplomatic disputes just as the United States entered the war. Through 1915‚Äì16, China and Indonesia were the major bases for the conspirators, and significant efforts were made by the British government to coax China into the war to attempt to control the German and Ghadar intrigues. This would also allow free purchase of arms from China for the Entente powers. However, Yuan's proposals for bringing China into the war were against Japanese interests and gains from the war. This along with Japanese support for Sun Yat Sen and rebels in southern China laid the foundations for deterioration of Anglo- Japanese relations as early as 1916. After the end of the Great War, Japan increasingly became a haven for radical Indian nationalists in exile, who were protected by patriotic Japanese societies. Notable among these were Rash Behari Bose, Tarak Nath Das, and A. M. Sahay. The protections offered to these nationalists, most notably by Toyama Mitsuru's Black Dragon Society, effectively prevented British efforts to repatriate them and became a major policy concern. Ghadar Party and IIC The IIC was formally disbanded in November 1918. Most of its members became closely associated with communism and the Soviet Union. Bhupendranath Dutta and Virendranath Chattopadhyay alias Chatto arrived in Moscow in 1920. Narendranath Bhattacharya, under a new identity of M. N. Roy, was among the first Indian communists and made a memorable speech in the second congress of the Communist International that rejected Leninist views and foreshadowed Maoist peasant movements. Chatto himself was in Berlin until 1932 as the general secretary of the League Against Imperialism and was able to convince Jawaharlal Nehru to affiliate the Indian National Congress with the league in 1927. He later fled Nazi Germany for the Soviet Union but disappeared in 1937 under Joseph Stalin's Great Purge. The Ghadar Party, suppressed during the war, revived itself in 1920 and openly declared its communist beliefs. Although sidelined in California, it remained relatively stronger in East Asia, where it allied itself with the Chinese Communist Party. World War II Although the conspiracy failed during World War I, the movement being suppressed at the time and several of its key leaders hanged or incarcerated, several prominent Ghadarites also managed to flee India to Japan and Thailand. The concept of a revolutionary movement for independence also found a revival amongst later generation Indian leaders, most notably Subhas Chandra Bose who, towards the mid-1930s, began calling for a more radical approach towards colonial domination. During World War II, several of these leaders were instrumental in seeking Axis support to revive such a concept. Bose himself, from the very beginning of World War II, actively evaluated the concept of revolutionary movement against the Raj, interacting with Japan and subsequently escaping to Germany to raise an Indian armed force, the Indische Legion, to fight in India against Britain. He later returned to Southeast Asia to take charge of the Indian National Army which was formed following the labour of exiled nationalists, efforts from within Japan to revive a similar concept, and the direction and leadership of people like Mohan Singh, Giani Pritam Singh, and Rash Behari Bose. The most famous of these saw the formation of the Indian Independence League, the Indian National Army and ultimately the Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind in Southeast Asia. Commemoration The 1915 Singapore Mutiny memorial tablet at the entrance of the Victoria Memorial Hall, Singapore The Ghadar Memorial Hall in San Francisco honours members of the party who were hanged following the Lahore conspiracy trial, and the Ghadar Party Memorial Hall in Jalandhar, Punjab commemorates the Ghadarites who were involved in the conspiracy. Several of those executed during the conspiracy are today honoured in India. Kartar Singh is honoured with a memorial at his birthplace of the Village of Sarabha. The Ayurvedic Medicine College in Ludhiana is also named in his honour. The Indian government has produced stamps honouring several of those involved in the conspiracy, including Har Dayal, Bhai Paramanand, and Rash Behari Bose. Several other revolutionaries are also honoured through India and the Indian American population. A memorial plaque commemorating the Komagata Maru was unveiled by Jawaharlal Nehru at Budge Budge in Calcutta in 1954, while a second plaque was unveiled in 1984 at Gateway Pacific, Vancouver by the Canadian government. A heritage foundation to commemorate the passengers from the Komagata Maru excluded from Canada was established in 2005. In Singapore, two memorial tablets at the entrance of the Victoria Memorial Hall and four plaques in St Andrew's Cathedral commemorate the British soldiers and civilians killed during the Singapore Mutiny. In Ireland, a memorial at the Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin commemorates the dead from the Jalandhar mutiny of the Connaught Rangers. The Southern Asian Institute of Columbia University today runs the Taraknath Das foundation to support work relating to India. Famous awardees include R. K. Narayan, Robert Goheen, Philip Talbot, Anita Desai and SAKHI and Joseph Elder. Note on the name The conspiracy is known under several different names, including the 'Hindu Conspiracy', the 'Indo- German Conspiracy', the 'Ghadar conspiracy' (or 'Ghadr conspiracy'), or the 'German plot'. The term Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy is closely associated with the uncovering of the Annie Larsen plot in the United States, and the ensuing trial of Indian nationalists and the staff of the German Consulate of San Francisco for violating American neutrality. The trial itself was called the Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy Trial, and the conspiracy was reported in the media (and later studied by several historians) as Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy. However, the conspiracy involved not only Hindus and Germans, but also substantial numbers of Muslims and Punjabi Sikhs, and strong Irish support that pre-dated German and Turkish involvement. The term Hindu (or Hindoo) was used commonly in opprobrium in America to identify Indians regardless of religion. Likewise, conspiracy was also a term with negative connotations. The term Hindu Conspiracy was used by the government to actively discredit the Indian revolutionaries at a time the United States was about to join the war against Germany. The term 'Ghadar Conspiracy' may refer more specifically to the mutiny planned for February 1915 in India, while the term 'German plot' or 'Christmas Day Plot' may refer more specifically to the plans for shipping arms to Jatin Mukherjee in Autumn 1915. The term Indo-German conspiracy is also commonly used to refer to later plans in Southeast Asia and to the mission to Kabul which remained the remnant of the conspiracy at the end of the war. All of these were parts of the larger conspiracy. Most scholars reviewing the American aspect use the name Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy, the Hindu- Conspiracy or the Ghadar Conspiracy, while most reviewing the conspiracy over its entire span from Southeast Asia through Europe to the United States more often use the term Indo-German conspiracy. In British-India, the Rowlatt committee set up investigate the events referred to them as \\"The Seditious conspiracy\\".

Mieczys≈Çaw Jastrun born Mojsze Agatstein (29 October 1903 - 22 February 1983) was a Polish poet and essayist of Jewish origin.Polish-Jewish literature The main themes of his poetry are philosophy and morality. He translated French, Russian and German poetry to Polish.  Life  Jastrun was born in Korolivka, Borshchiv Raion (in the former Eastern Galicia) into a Jewish family, the son of J√≥zef Agatstein and Maria Agatstein n√©e Wiensohn. He spent his childhood in Jod≈Çowa, and went to public school in Ryglice, where his father had opened a surgery. The family moved several times to places where Joseph worked. Through 1915‚àí1919 Mieczys≈Çaw stayed in Krak√≥w, where he went to gymnasium. Due to the onset of Polish‚ÄìSoviet War he interrupted his studies and volunteered to the Polish Army. However, he did not participate in engagements as he contracted typhus. On 9 March 1920 together with his older brother, Jerzy Stanis≈Çaw (later Jerzy Gierowski) he was baptised in the parish church in Jod≈Çowa. He did not return to Krak√≥w immediately and instead completed the last two high school forms in First General Liceum in Tarn√≥w. During that time he lived in Ple≈õna, with his former governess (1921‚àí1923). Later during the 1920s, Jastrun studied Polish, German and philosophy at the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w; he received a doctorate in 1929. He was also close to the Skamander group and wrote several works of poetry strongly influenced by symbolism. At the onset of World War II, Jastrun took refuge in Lviv, then occupied by the Soviet Union, where he worked as a teacher. After Nazi Germany occupied Lviv in 1941, he relocated to Warsaw, took the name Jan Klonowicz and worked as an underground teacher. Jastrun's Jewish identity remained undiscovered during the war, and he survived the Holocaust. After the end of the war, Jastrun lived briefly in Lublin and Lodz before moving back to Warsaw in 1949. He joined the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR), and in the post-war era wrote several books dealing with the Nazi occupation and the Holocaust in the style of socialist realism. Jastrun also wrote biographies of Jan Kochanowski, Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz S≈Çowacki, translated works by poets such as Lorca, Pushkin, H√∂lderlin and Rilke into Polish, and taught modern poetry at the University of Warsaw. In 1964 he was one of the signatories of the so-called Letter of 34 to Prime Minister J√≥zef Cyrankiewicz regarding freedom of culture.

It is closely related to chemical kinetics, but is concerned with individual chemical events on atomic length scales and over very brief time periods. It considers state-to-state kinetics between reactant and product molecules in specific quantum states, and how energy is distributed between translational, vibrational, rotational, and electronic modes.Laidler, K.J. Chemical Kinetics (3rd ed., Harper & Row 1987), Chap.12 Experimental methods of reaction dynamics probe the chemical physics associated with molecular collisions. They include crossed molecular beam and infrared chemiluminescence experiments, both recognized by the 1986 Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded to Dudley Herschbach, Yuan T. Lee, and John C. Polanyi \\"for their contributions concerning the dynamics of chemical elementary processes\\", In the crossed beam method used by Herschbach and Lee, narrow beams of reactant molecules in selected quantum states are allowed to react in order to determine the reaction probability as a function of such variables as the translational, vibrational and rotational energy of the reactant molecules and their angle of approach. In contrast the method of Polanyi measures vibrational energy of the products by detecting the infrared chemiluminescence emitted by vibrationally excited molecules, in some cases for reactants in defined energy states. Spectroscopic observation of reaction dynamics on the shortest time scales is known as femtochemistry, since the typical times studied are of the order of 1 femtosecond = 10‚àí15 s. This subject has been recognized by the award of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Ahmed Zewail. In addition, theoretical studies of reaction dynamics involve calculating the potential energy surface for a reaction as a function of nuclear positions, and then calculating the trajectory of a point on this surface representing the state of the system. A correction can be applied to include the effect of quantum tunnelling through the activation energy barrier, especially for the movement of hydrogen atoms.

In some amphibian species, lymph hearts are in pairs, and may number as many as 200 in one animal the size of a worm, while salamanders have as many as 23 pairs of lymph hearts. Lymphatic system of frog The lymphatic system of a frog consists of lymph, lymph vessels, lymph heart, lymph spaces and spleen. Some mast cells can also be found in the lymphatics of the tongue of some of the frog species. Lymphatics and lymph As lymph is a filtrate of blood, it closely resembles the plasma in its water content. Lymph also contains a small amount of metabolic waste and a much smaller amount of protein than that of blood. Lymph vessels carry the lymph and, in the frog, open into the four lymph hearts. These lymph hearts are located on the dorsal side of frog's body. The front pair is situated below the shoulder blades. The posterior pair is on either side of a long, rod-like bone called a urostyle, formed by the fusion of the last few vertebrae. The anterior pair opens into the subclavian vein and the posterior pair into the femoral vein. The pair near the third vertebra pumps lymph into the jugular vein. The other pair at the end of the vertebral column pump lymph into the iliac vein in the legs. Mast cells in the lymphatics of the tongue Rana catesbiana and Rana nigromaculata have mast cells in the lymphatics of the tongue. These are round and in the monocellular layer of the lymphatic walls either in close adhesion or in contact with the cytoplasmic process. Mechanism of the lymph hearts The lymph hearts rhythmically and slowly pump to drive the lymph into the veins. It is possible to see the lymph hearts beat by looking on the dorsal surface on either side of the urostyle. In the toad, the normal lymph heart rate is about 50 beats per minute. Thus the lymph emerging out of blood ultimately merges into the blood. It returns the proteins back to blood. Sizes of the lymph heart and the rate at which they pump These hearts vary in size from microscopic in lungfish to an estimated 20-liter capacity in some of the largest dinosaurs. In frogs and turtles they pump at rates higher than the blood heart and the volumes pumped are quite remarkable. In toads and frogs, this volume can amount to about 1/50 the output of blood from the heart. In amphibians, lymph hearts lie at vein junctions. Frogs and salamanders have 10 to 20 lymph hearts, while caecilians have more than 100. Conversely, reptiles have single pair of lymph hearts in the pelvic area. In flightless (ratite) birds, the lymph heart function is less clear and the two almond-sized hearts located near the spinal column close to the hip joint are thought to be involved in inflating and deflating the phallus with lymph, which is of a significant size in both sexes of emus and ostriches.

A QName concisely associates the URI of an XML namespace with the local name of an element, attribute, or identifier in that namespace. To make this association, the QName assigns the local name a prefix that corresponds to its namespace. In all, the QName comprises the URI of the XML namespace, the prefix, and the local name. The World Wide Web Consortium introduced the QName convention in the 1999 specification \\"Namespaces in XML\\".  Purpose  Since URI references can be long and may contain prohibited characters for element/attribute naming, QNames are used to create a mapping between the URI and a namespace prefix. The mapping enables the abbreviation of URIs, therefore it achieves a more convenient way to write XML documents. (see Example)  Formal definition  QNames are formally defined by the W3C as:Namespaces in XML 1.0 (Second Edition) QName ::= PrefixedName  UnprefixedName PrefixedName ::= Prefix ':' LocalPart UnprefixedName ::= LocalPart Prefix ::= NCName LocalPart ::= NCName NCName is defined as follows: NCName ::= Name - (Char* ':' Char*) (* An XML Name, minus the \\":\\" *) Name ::= NameStartChar (NameChar)* NameStartChar ::= \\":\\"  [A-Z]  \\"_\\"  [a-z]  [#xC0-#xD6]  [#xD8-#xF6]  [#xF8-#x2FF]  [#x370-#x37D]  [#x37F-#x1FFF]  [#x200C-#x200D]  [#x2070-#x218F]  [#x2C00-#x2FEF]  [#x3001-#xD7FF]  [#xF900-#xFDCF]  [#xFDF0-#xFFFD]  [#x10000-#xEFFFF] NameChar ::= NameStartChar  \\"-\\"  \\".\\"  [0-9]  #xB7  [#x0300-#x036F]  [#x203F-#x2040] Char ::= (* any Unicode char, excluding surrogate blocks FFFE and FFFF. *) #x9  #xA  #xD  [#x20-#xD7FF]  [#xE000-#xFFFD]  [#x10000-#x10FFFF] Whereby the Prefix is used as placeholder for the namespace and the LocalPart as the local part of the qualified name. A local part can be an attribute name or an element name.  Example  In line two the prefix \\"x\\" is declared to be associated with the URI \\"http://example.com/ns/foo\\". This prefix can further on be used as abbreviation for this namespace. Subsequently the tag \\"x:p\\" is a valid QName because it uses the \\"x\\" as namespace reference and \\"p\\" as local part.

The smelter had a production capacity of 185,000 tonnes of aluminium a year. It was operated by Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals Australia, a joint venture between Alcoa (60%) and Alumina Limited (39.25%). Alumina was brought in by ship and unloaded at a dedicated pier, and approximately half of this finished aluminium was sold to the neighbouring Alcoa Australia Rolled Products plant, where aluminium was rolled into sheet for can manufacture. The remainder of the aluminium was despatched by road as ingots. Around 1000 people were employed at the Point Henry plant. Construction of the smelter at Point Henry commenced in 1960 by the Cavalier Construction Company. Smelting commenced in 1962, with full production commencing on 4 April 1963.R. Arklay and I. Sayer - 'Geelong's Electric Supply' - September 1970 The initial electricity supply to the smelter was a 220 kV transmission lines from the Geelong Terminal Station direct to the smelter. When production started, the maximum power demand of the smelter was 39.76 Megawatts (MW). By June 1964 it was 68.38 MW, and by October 76.6 MW ‚Äì more than the entire Geelong region's demand. In November the following year it was 78.88 MW, February 1967 79.84 MW, and 140 MW by 1969. On 20 March 1969 Alcoa's own brown coal-fired Anglesea Power Station was brought on line. With 150 MW capacity, the power station was connected to the smelter by around 30 kilometres of high-voltage transmission lines, and was used to augment the supply from the Victorian electrical grid. The power demand of the smelter was 360 MW for a 185,000 tonne annual production capacity in 2014, of which approximately 40 per cent was met by the Anglesea power station. The Point Henry smelter, along with the smelter at Portland, used 18 to 25 per cent of Victoria's electricity production during the 2000s. In March 2010 it was announced that the operators of Loy Yang A power station (Loy Yang Power) had signed a contract with the smelter operators for the supply of electricity to power aluminium smelters at Portland and Point Henry until 2036, the existing power contracts expiring in 2014. View of the smelter from the East  Closure  In December 2013, the electricity hedge agreement between Loy Yang A and Point Henry was mutually terminated as a result of a court ordered mediation. Following a board meeting in February 2014, Alcoa Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld announced that the smelter‚Äîalong with two rolling mills‚Äîwould close at the end of 2014. Kleinfeld explained, \\"These assets are no longer competitive and are not financially sustainable today or into the future.\\" The company stated that its Portland smelter, also in the Australian state of Victoria, will remain operational, while a coal mine and power station that power the Point Henry facility will be put up for sale. Power to the potline was turned off on Thursday 31 July 2014. The rolling mill ceased operation on 19 December 2014. Alcoa has commenced decommissioning the site, a process that is expected to take three to five years. The company has prepared a community masterplan for the site following remediation.

These places differ from Cannabis coffee shops in that those are also operating coffee shops and where cannabis is openly sold, usually found in the Netherlands, while social clubs are usually not selling cannabis, and only accessible to members. History=Beginnings Cannabis Social Clubs became popular in the United States during prohibition. Cannabis was often used as a legal intoxicant since alcohol was illegal. Teapads were developed as clubs in urban areas where jazz music was performed and cannabis was consumed. Teapads usually catered to those in the jazz scene and were usually furnished comfortably, often playing jazz music. Music in homage from these clubs arose; Gene Krupa even composed an entire album named \\"Teapad Songs Volume 1\\". These clubs disappeared after cannabis became illegal. The history of Cannabis Social Clubs A Cannabis Social Club is a concept of the pan-European non-government organization ENCOD conceived in 2005 as a way to enable legal production and distribution of cannabis for adults. Cannabis Social Clubs are non-commercial organizations which organize the professional, collective cultivation of very limited amounts of cannabis, just enough to cover the personal needs of their club members.Drugs, Crime, and Justice: Contemporary Perspectives, Third Edition, p. 534, Larry K.

They are also referred to as Cannabis Consumption Clubs. Cultivation, transport, distribution and consumption are subject to security and quality checks, and are done without publicity or advertisement of any kind.

Mission The 28th Operational Weather Squadron is responsible for producing and disseminating mission planning and execution weather analyses, forecasts, and briefings for US Air Force, USCENTCOM forces. This weather squadron is responsible for base or post forecasting, developing weather products, briefing transient aircrews, and weather warnings for all of their geographical units. Using automatic observing systems located at all military installations and communicating with their combat weather flights, the squadron is able to 'watch' the weather in their entire area of responsibility from one central location. History On January 26, 1945, the commanding general of the US Army Air Forces in the Pacific requested two mobile weather squadrons be activated for projected land operations in the theater's forward area. The Weather Wing constituted the 27th and 28th Weather Squadrons on May 30, 1945. The squadrons activated at Seymour Johnson Field, North Carolina, on June 5, 1945, and underwent intensive training. The squadrons were ordered to port for movement to the Pacific in August 1945, but the order was soon thereafter rescinded when Japan capitulated. Both squadrons were inactivated on November 9, 1945. The 28th Weather Squadron was reactivated on March 1, 1949, at Bushy Park, England to provide weather services for US Air Force and US Army units within the British Isles. The squadron was assigned to the 2105th Air Weather Group, redesignated the 2058th Air Weather Wing in October 1951. The 28th's predominant customer was the 3d Air Division which was activated in 1948 under the command of then- Maj Gen Leon W. Johnson. Maj Gen Leon W. Johnson, a World War II Medal of Honor recipient, was a member of the initial cadre of officers assigned to the US Air Corps weather service when it was formed in 1937. The headquarters of the 28th Weather Squadron was relocated to South Ruislip, England, near 3d Air Division headquarters, on June 7, 1949; but returned to Bushy Park in March 1951. The headquarters moved to RAF Northolt, England, on October 24, 1962. The 28th was reassigned to the 2d Weather Wing on February 8, 1954, in concert with an Air Weather Service overseas wing reorganization. The 28th Weather Squadron's emblem was in use by 1952. The Air Force officially approved its use on April 10, 1959. The 28th Weather Squadron was one of seven weather squadrons eliminated as part of an Air Force directed Military Airlift Command programming action to reduce Air Weather Service command elements. It was inactivated on July 1, 1971, and its detachments were assigned to the 31st Weather Squadron. Air Weather Service commander Brig Gen Albert J. Kaehn, Jr. approved a reorganization plan in 1979 that included reactivation of the 28th Weather Squadron, which he officiated on July 1, 1980, at RAF Mildenhall, England. Detachments of the 28th at Lakenheath, Bentwaters, Woodbridge, Mildenhall, Upper Heyford, Fairford, and Alconbury Royal Air Force stations were activated simultaneously. With the Air Force-directed divestiture of Air Weather Service \\"to give mission commanders ownership of their weather support resources\\", the 28th Weather Squadron and its detachments were again inactivated on September 30, 1991. Under the Air Force Weather re-engineering effort, the 28th Weather Squadron was redesignated the 28th Operational Weather Squadron on February 5, 1999. The 28th was activated at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, on February 17, 1999, and assigned to the Air Combat Command's 609th Air Operations Group, severing its deep roots planted in England during the Cold War. On July 20, 2006, the 28th Operational Weather Squadron was split into two entities: the 28th Operational Weather Squadron, which maintained USCENTCOM functions; and the 9th Operational Weather Squadron, which continued CONUS-based operations. The 9th Operational Weather Squadron dissolved in 2008 and CONUS functions were relocated to the 26th Operational Weather Squadron, Barksdale AFB, Louisiana. Currently the 28th Operational Weather Squadron is the only OWS assigned to Shaw AFB, South Carolina.

Its geographical position at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa as well as its proximity to the Suez canal has historically favoured merchant shipping as an important industry for this European island state. As of 2005 Cyprus holds the 9th largest (by DWT) merchant navy in the world and the 3rd largest in the European Union.Financial Mirror: Cyprus Shipping Boom Ancient History Merchant shipping has long been of great importance to the island, with its roots stretching well back into antiquity. Examples of shipwrecks discovered off the island‚Äôs coast (e.g. the Kyrenia ship) plus evidence of ancient ports (e.g. Amathus) give proof to the fact that Cyprus was a major seafaring player in antiquity and located along important trade routes. 2005 Registration of Merchant Ships. Modern history Merchant shipping has been actively developed by successive governments since the independence of Cyprus from British rule in 1960 and has since experienced sustained growth.Country- specific remarks The first shipping hub was created in the port of Famagusta, but since the Turkish invasion of 1974 the port has been occupied and is currently declared illegal. Most business are now transferred to Limassol Port and to a lesser extent Larnaca Port. Cyprus has traditionally been a popular shipping centre and home to some of the leading names of the global shipping industry.Lloyds Ship Management Directory Among the ship management companies established and operating, 87% are controlled by EU interests. These companies employ almost 40.000 seafarers out of whom 5.000 are EU nationals. According to the latest governmental estimates, the total fleet managed from Cyprus represents 20% of the world third‚Äìparty ship management market (out of 10.000 ships in the world shipmanagement market under a wide approach). Cranes in Limassol Harbour. Top 11 flags of convenience account for almost 55% of the entire world fleet. EU Tonnage Tax Scheme The new tonnage tax scheme for Cyprus was approved by the European Commission on 24 March 2010, as compatible with the requirements of the EU Acquis communautaire, in accordance with the relevant guidelines on State Aid to Maritime Transport. This simplified tonnage tax system is approved for the first time for an EU Member State, a state with an open registry. The said scheme was approved for a ten years period, which may be extended for a further period of ten years. The provisions of the Law are applicable for the fiscal year 2010, starting on the 1st January 2010 and will be valid until December 2019.Tax News: Cyprus: An International Maritime Centre  Department of Merchant Shipping The Department of Merchant Shipping (DMS) was established and started functioning as a distinct entity in the Ministry of Communications and Works, in 1977. The service existed, however since 1963 and functioned under the Department of Ports. The Cyprus registry ranks tenth among international fleets and third within the European Union, with a merchant fleet exceeding 22 million gross tons. The department is responsible for the development of maritime activities which include: *Ship registration, *Administration and enforcement of the Merchant Shipping Laws *Control of ships and enforcement of international conventions ratified by the Government of Cyprus *Marine conservation *Vessel traffic monitoring in the sea around Cyprus and information system implementation *Monitoring the conditions of living and work on board Cyprus Ships *Registration, training and certification of seafarers *Control of Coastal passenger vessels and small craft *Investigation of marine accidents *Continuous updating of the merchant shipping legislation and its harmonization with that of the European Union *Coordination of the EU Integrated Maritime Policy *Administration of the State Aid Scheme for Maritime Transport and the Tonnage Tax System *Promotion of Cyprus as an International Registry and a base for international maritime operations Open Registry Regime Cyprus has the only EU-approved ‚ÄúOpen Registry‚Äù regime with a wide and legally endorsed Tonnage Tax System (TTS), which was introduced with the Merchant Shipping Law in 2010 and covers the three main ‚Äúmaritime transport‚Äù activities: * Ship owning * Ship management (crew and technical management) * Chartering Maritime Centre Stelios Haji-Ioannou visiting the Cyprus Maritime Center in 1989 The BSM Maritime Training Centre was founded in 1983 and is IMO approved operating under the auspices of the Cyprus Administration.

The fossils are surrounded by frills that have been interpreted (Wade 1972) as sets of tentacles. The bifurcating radial ribs, spreading from a central dome, serve to distinguish this genus from Palaeophragmodictya, and may represent the channels of the gastrovascular system (Fedonkin & Cope 1985). Fossils of Rugoconites have been interpreted as early sponges (Gehling 1996) although this is countered by Sepkoski et al. (2002), who interpreted the organism as a free-swimming jellyfish-like cnidarian; similar to Ovatoscutum. However, the fossil is consistently preserved as a neat circular form and its general morphology does not vary, therefore a benthic and perhaps slow-moving or sessile lifestyle is more likely. Ivantstov & Fedonkin (2002), suggest that Rugoconites may possess tri-radial symmetry and be a member of the Trilobozoa. Rugoconites have been reported in clusters; this may represent a social/colonial way of life, or simply accumulation by the action of currents, sea-floor processes, or possibly preservational conditions (Droser 2007).

In sentencing the two journalists, Rozenes said: \\"Courts in Australia and England have made clear statements to the effect that journalists are not above the law and may not without penalty expect to be permitted to follow their personal collegiate standards where those standards conflict with the law of the land. Until that law is altered, if it is ever to be, then journalists remain in no different position than all other citizens.\\" As a consequence of the case, federal and state governments in Australia moved to change the law to permit judges discretion to take into consideration the journalist's code of never revealing their source.

Most notably, he is known as the leader of the gospel choir, Myron Butler & Levi. Since 1997, he's worked as a vocal director and backup singer for several notable artists to include Kirk Franklin, Marvin Sapp, Smokie Norful, Donald Lawrence, and Yolanda Adams. Biography Butler was born as Myron Demond Butler, on July 27, 1974, just outside Tampa, Florida in the city of Bradenton, Florida, and he was raised in Dallas, Texas. At an early age, Myron Butler developed an appreciation for music and, at 17, his first song, \\"Lift Him Up\\", was recorded by Dallas‚Äô DFW Mass Choir. While working on the recording, Butler became good friends with the choir's director Kirk Franklin. During his last two years of high-school, Myron formed a community choir of his teen-aged peers in Dallas, but, upon graduation, he left them to pursue a degree in psychology at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia. After completing his first year, Butler decided not to return to school. He remained in Atlanta for a year before deciding to return to Dallas, where his choir had continued to grow, in spite of changes in personnel. The group, which had become popular in the area began calling itself God's Property and welcomed Myron as their main choral director. Returning to Dallas allowed Myron Butler to renew his friendship with Franklin, and God's Property offered backup vocals for Franklin and The Family on occasional dates in and around Dallas. He would later join Franklin's group One Nation Crew for that group's short existence. He also did a song with a Dallas based youth choir called Total Praise on their CD \\"Faithfulness\\". Butler also serves as minister of music at Bishop T.D Jakes mega church, The Potter's House in Dallas, Tx. He married Timberlyn Butler on July 5, 2003.

Mission The 21st Operational Weather Squadron provides highly accurate, timely and relevant environmental situational awareness to Air Force, Navy, and Army Commanders operating in US European Command in partnership with NATO. The 21st OWS is responsible for producing and disseminating mission planning and execution weather analyses, terminal aerodrome forecasts, and briefings for Air Force, Army, SHAPE, EUCOM, AFRICOM, USAFE, USAREUR, SOCEUR, and NAVEUR forces operating at 491 DoD installations/sites encompassing 92 countries and 23M square miles within the Atlantic Ocean, Europe, Russia, Africa and the Middle East. This weather squadron is responsible for base or post forecasting, developing weather products, briefing transient aircrews, and weather warnings for all of their geographical units. Using automatic observing systems located at all military installations and communicating with their combat weather flights, the squadron is able to 'watch' the weather in their entire area of responsibility from one central location. The Operational Weather Squadron is the first place a newly schooled weather apprentice will report. At the squadron, working alongside a seasoned weather professional, the forecaster is trained in all aspects of Air Force meteorology, from pilot briefing to tactical forecasting. The weather squadron works closely with the combat weather flights they support to ensure a flawless exchange of weather information.

Meaning Blue and yellow are the Air Force colors. Blue alludes to the sky, the primary theater of Air Force operations. The knight represents the unit's readiness and its dedication to support the warfighter and its role as a \\"keeper of peace\\". He leaps over a weather vane symbolizing a commander's ability to overcome adverse weather conditions due to accurate weather information provided by the Squadron. The horse signifies the unit's key mission of carrying tailored intelligence information to operational customers and the ability to complete the Air Force mission. The lance carried by the knight denotes the Squadron as the \\"tip\\" of weather forecasting services reaching into the theater to make a difference; the shield connotes the ability to safeguard those who may be in harm's way. The wind anemometer within the shield is a standard trademark for Air Force weather personnel and a key tool for the craft. The developing thunderstorm in the background symbolizes the weather hazards that may impede combat operations.

Some authorities consider this and all of the members of the genus Chlorocebus to be a single widespread species, Chlorocebus aethiops. Physical description The green monkey is a sexually dimorphic species, with males typically being slightly larger than females. Wild adult males weigh between and measure between , while the females usually weigh between and measure between .  Habitat and distribution  Callithrix monkeys can be found in a wide range of wooded habitats, ranging from very dry Sahel woodland to the edge of rainforests. It is also commonly seen in coastal regions, where known to feed on seashore foods such as crabs. It also takes a wide variety of other foods, including fruits and invertebrates. The green monkey is found in West Africa from Senegal and The Gambia to the Volta River. It has been introduced to the Cape Verde islands off north-western Africa (islands of Santiago and Brava only) as early as the second half of the 16th century, and the West Indian islands of Saint Kitts, Nevis, Saint Martin, and Barbados. It was introduced to the West Indies in the late 17th century when slave trade ships traveled to the Caribbean from West Africa.  Behavior  As other members of the genus Chlorocebus, the green monkey is highly social and usually seen in groups. They usually live in groups of up to 7 to 80 individuals. Within these groups, there is distinct social hierarchy evidenced by grooming behaviors and gender relationships. Green monkeys are known to communicate both verbally and non-verbally. They have distinct calls which they use to warn others in the group of predators, and even have specific calls for specific predators. Body language, such as the display of brightly colored genitalia is also used to communicate danger, but can also be used as a way of establishing dominance. It has also been documented that green monkeys may use facial expressions to express their emotional state.Matthew Keller, , \\"Animal Diversity Web\\", 3/26/12 Reproduction Green monkeys live in a polygynous society, revolving around the alpha males. The alpha males have control over social interactions and mating between other males and females in the group. These monkeys are seasonal breeders, breeding during the April to June months (October and November in the Nyes area North West of Thies), during which rainfall is the heaviest. It is during these rainy seasons that fruit is most abundant, so it is speculated that green monkeys schedule their breeding around this time, when resources are most abundant. They breed about once a year, with males reaching sexual maturity in five years, females in two. Despite infant mortality being fairly high, at roughly 57%, green monkeys are known to be heavily invested in their offspring, with mothers taking care of their young for about a year before letting them venture out as individual adults.

Seaspeed was a jointly owned subsidiary of train operators British Rail (under British Rail Hovercraft Limited) and France's SNCF, and was established in 1965. Seaspeed operated several services; its first route, running between Cowes and Southampton, was launched on 6 July 1966. Initially operating a fleet of SR.N6s for these short-distance services, it opted to procure large SR.N4s to launch its cross-Channel ferry service; the first of these hoverferries was introduced in 1968. On this route, Seaspeed competed against traditional ferries and rival SR.N4 operator Hoverlloyd. In 1976, after concluding that it could not attain suitable profitability from its smaller SR.N6 services, Seaspeed sold these to rival hovercraft company Hovertravel. Focusing upon its cross-Channel service, it opted to repeatedly upgrade the SR.N4 fleet. During the late 1970s, Seaspeed introduced the stretched SR.N4 Mk.III, greatly increasing its capacity; it also introduced a single French-built SEDAM N500 hovercraft, although the latter's performance was found lacking and it was returned to SNCF after only a few years. During 1981, in response to intensifying competition and rising costs, Seaspeed decided to merge with its historic rival Hoverlloyd to create the combined Hoverspeed. This new entity continued operated the SR.N4 fleet for many years, finally withdrawing hovercraft services in 2000. Background and formation During the late 1950s and early 1960s, British inventor Sir Christopher Cockerell had, in cooperation with British aerospace manufacturer Saunders- Roe, developed a pioneering new form of transportation, embodied in the form of the experimental SR.N1 vehicle, which became widely known as the hovercraft.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 82. British manufacturer Saunders-Roe proceeded with work on various hovercraft designs, successfully developing multiple commercially-viable vehicles in the mid-1960s. These included the SR.N4, a large cross-Channel ferry capable of seating up to 418 passengers along with 60 cars, and the SR.N5, the first commercially-active hovercraft.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 238, 595. Various operators became interested in operating hovercraft across various routes, including the highly-trafficked ones across the English Channel between the UK and France. Nationalised railway operator British Rail, which already had its Sealink ferry company as a subsidiary, was one such company; its interest was likely to have been heavily influenced by a political decision by the Ministry of Technology to establish a publicly owned hovercraft operator, in addition to strong interest from other commercial operators.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 200-203. During 1965, it entered into discussions with various would-be partners, including the British Overseas Airways Corporation and British European Airways.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 203-205. Having approached French railway operator SNCF, the two train companies decided to jointly establish a new venture to enter the market upon.Competition Commission report Accordingly, in 1965, British Rail Hovercraft Limited was established; although it would be another three years before it launched its cross-Channel service. One of the first decisions taken by Seaspeed's management, announced in November 1965, was its commitment for the Saunders-Roe's SR.N4; in fact, the company agreed to acquire the first example, which was essentially a prototype, and thus would serve as the type's launch customer.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 202. According to authors Robin Paine and Roger Syms, the selection of the SR.N4 had been a foregone conclusion and that the predominant reason for the company's formation was to operate such a vehicle.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 205. Cross-Channel Seaspeed SRN4 The Princess Anne at Dover in 1980 Seaspeed investigated various options for its intended services, intensifying its evaluation efforts in 1967.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 229-231. Management was keen to align with existing Sealink services so that, in the event of a vessel's failure, it could be more readily substituted for; thus either Dover or Folkestone on the English side and Calais or Boulogne-sur-Mer on the French side became the preferred options. However, Folkestone was eliminated due to its small harbour and high exposure to southerly winds.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 230-232. SNCF, being keen to support the initiative, offered to build a railway line and station adjacent to the proposed Boulogne hoverport at its own expense.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 234. During August 1968, Seaspeed commenced its cross-Channel services from Dover, England to Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer, France using its first SR.N4.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 307-309. Its first two SR.N4s were named The Princess Margaret and The Princess Anne respectively; the former featured in the James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever. Seaspeed was not the only hovercraft operator that decided to move on the cross-Channel market at the time; a rival company, Hoverlloyd, was also established in the 1960s and launched its own competing route between Calais and Ramsgate. The two firms would compete with one another, as well as incumbent ferry operators, for market share throughout Seaspeed's existence. Despite this rivalry, considerations were made towards mutually beneficial cooperation; at an early stage, Seaspeed's management considered conducting SR.N5 services out of Hoverlloyd's hoverport at Ramsgate.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 232-233. In early 1976, the British Rail board approved a plan to drastically upgrade the two existing SR.N4s by lengthening them, achieved via the insertion of an almost 17.1 metre (56.1 ft) long section.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 555-556. This change increased the passenger capacity of the craft from 254 passengers to 418, while also having raised the car capacity to a total of 60. According to Paine and Syms, rival operator Hoverlloyd was interested in the modification, but did not have such work done to their own SR.N4 fleet, allegedly due to a lack of available finances.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 234. Isle of Wight Seaspeed Sea Hawk at Cowes Seaspeed also operated passenger-only services across the Solent using a pair of smaller SR.N6 hovercraft, named Sea Hawk and Sea Eagle. This service, running between Cowes and Southampton, commenced on 6 July 1966.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 226. This initial route was later joined by Portsmouth‚ÄìRyde and Portsmouth‚ÄìCowes services starting from Portsmouth Harbour railway station.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 227. By mid-1967, Seaspeed's Solent services had carried 67,600 passengers, the Southampton-Cowes route proved to be the most trafficked of the three services.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 226-227. The Southampton terminal was on the west side of the river Itchen just upstream of the floating bridge terminal. A bus link connected the service to Southampton Central station. Seaspeed made various alterations to their smaller services over time. Between 1968 and 1972, trials of the 67-seater Hoverspeed HM2 craft were conducted, but the company concluded it to be unsuited to its routes.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 227-229. By 1972, Seaspeed's SR.N6s had been stretched and furnished with uprated engines to increase their capacities. However, the company eventually concluded that the SR.N6s were too expensive to run to achieve a sufficient return on investment on any of the three Solent routes.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 227-229. During 1976, the Solent routes were transferred to rival hovercraft operator Hovertravel, which already operated its own services in the area. During 1980, Hovertravel decided to entirely discontinue the Cowes-Southampton service; this move was attributed both to rising costs and increased competition on the route from watercraft such as hydrofoils and catamarans, opting instead to concentrate its resources on its Ryde-Southsea service, which was viewed as more commercially viable. Economics of large hovercraft operation A Seaspeed SR.N4 loading at Dover Hoverport, September 1970 Each SR.N4 was powered by an arrangement of four Bristol Proteus gas turbine engines; while these were marinised and proved to be one of the hovercraft's more reliable systems, they were relatively fuel- hungry, consuming significant amounts of aviation-grade kerosene.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 525-527, 547. As the worldwide oil crisis of the 1970s caused fuel prices to rise sharply, the operation of the SR.N4 became increasingly uneconomic. Furthermore, the closure of the British Hovercraft Corporation restricted support options, meaning that maintenance of the craft became more costly over time, and that neither like-for-like replacements or improved successor hovercraft were likely to be developed. Seaspeed (and later Hoverspeed) operated a single French-built SEDAM N500 hovercraft, designated N500-02, ', from 1977.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 554. In concept, it looked to be a capable vehicle, possessing advantages over the SR.N4 such as storing cars over two decks rather than one. However, the N500 was beset by design and operational problems that would never be successfully resolved; following a somewhat sporadic service on the cross-Channel route, the N500 was permanently withdrawn during 1983 and later scrapped.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 609-612. Various duty-free goods were sold onboard the SR.N4s during their cross- Channel transits. These sales comprised a meaningful portion of the service's overall revenue, therefore the company strongly emphasised the importance of onboard sales amongst their staff. The abolition of duty-free sales during the late 1990s further diminished operating income and contributed to the fleet's withdrawal. Increasing staffing requirements brought on by the implementation of new legislation and actions by trade unions also contributed to the craft's increasing operating costs.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 567-570, 600. Fresh competition from high-speed rail services, facilitated by the completion of the Channel Tunnel in 1996, undermined the SR.N4's speed advantage, drawing passengers away and further decreasing the service's commercial viability. These combined factors gradually worsened the SR.N4's economics as time progressed. Merger and rationalisation Hoverspeed SR.N4 Mk.III at Calais, September 2009 By 1980, it was obvious that cross-Channel hovercraft operation could only continue economically if the two operating companies merged, with consequent rationalisation. Therefore, in 1981, Seaspeed and Hoverlloyd merged to create the combined Hoverspeed following the granting of permission by the UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission.http://www.mmc.gov.uk/rep_pub/reports/1981/fulltext/138c01.pdfPaine and Syms 2012, pp. 616-626. The former Hoverlloyd services from Ramsgate were subsequently withdrawn after the 1982 season and the four ex-Hoverlloyd craft were thereafter based at Dover; they were gradually withdrawn from service between 1983 and 1993 to be used for spare parts for Hoverspeed's remaining SR.N4 fleet. In 1991, it was announced that the SR.N4 service would be eventually phased out entirely in favour of catamarans. Hoverspeed continued cross-Channel hovercraft operation until October 2000, when the last two SR.N4s were withdrawn and the era of 'hovering across the Channel' came to an end. All four ex-Hoverlloyd craft were eventually broken up and none remains extant. One ex-Seaspeed SR.N4 craft, The Princess Anne, remains and is stored at the Hovercraft Museum, Lee-on-Solent. For a time, the hoverport at Pegwell Bay was used as an engineering and administrative base by Hoverspeed after passenger services had ceased, but the site was eventually closed and the buildings demolished.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 14. The hovercraft pad, car- marshalling area and approach road are the main identifiable features that remain at the site.

Hometown Extra, its sister shopper publication, is delivered every Wednesday to nearly 13.000 households. Both publications are part of Lee Enterprises, which is located in Davenport. The Muscatine Journal also publishes news daily on their website. History The Muscatine Journal traces its history to October 27, 1840, when the first issue of the weekly Bloomington Herald was released. On June 7, 1849, the town‚Äôs name was officially changed from Bloomington to Muscatine, and the newspaper then became the Muscatine Journal. The late John Mahin played the most significant role in the newspaper's early history and headed the Journal for more than a half-century. John Mahin was apprenticed by his father in 1847, at the age of 13, to the owners of what was then still the Bloomington Herald to learn the printing trade. Mahin and his father, Jacob, purchased the Journal in 1852. Mahin became the Journals editor at that time, at the age of 19, and continued to publish the newspaper until his retirement in 1903. It was through Mahin that Alfred W. Lee came to Muscatine and later founded the newspaper group, which evolved into what now is Lee Enterprises, Inc. The most famous contributor to Muscatine Journal articles was Samuel Clemens, otherwise known as Mark Twain. Clemens contributed writings to the Journal in 1853, 1854, and 1855. Clemens lived in Muscatine in 1854, when the Muscatine Journal was run by his brother, Orion Clemens. In September 1864, John Mahin married Anne Lee, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John B. Lee of West Branch. In about 1880, Mr. and Mrs. Lee moved to Muscatine and Mahin‚Äôs father-in-law, John Lee, became the Journals bookkeeper. With them came their youngest son, Alfred, to take a position in the Muscatine post office under John Mahin, who was the postmaster as well as the newspaper editor. Alfred W. Lee later joined the staff of the Journal and started his newspaper career there. In 1886, Lee moved to Chicago where he continued his self-education in the newspaper business. Lee returned to Iowa to buy his first newspaper in the early 1890s, when he took charge of the Ottumwa Courier. In about 1899, he acquired a controlling interest in the Davenport Times. Lee and his associates purchased the Muscatine Journal in 1903, when John Mahin had reached the age of 70 years and was ready for retirement. Walter Lane was named as the Journals publisher when the Lee group assumed control and served until death, in 1907. The Journal has had many locations throughout its history, including the second floor of what is now DC Arnold‚Äôs on Iowa Avenue. In 1919, the current building was constructed with the pressroom and mailroom added in the early 1970s. That remodeling was made to accommodate a new Goss Community offset press, and coincided with the Journal's conversion to cold type composition. In 1999, the Muscatine Journal began printing remotely at the Quad City Times and the press area was remodeled to become the Muscatine distribution center for delivery of many regional newspapers in the Muscatine area.

From top-left to bottom- right: 250px Wes Craven's Scream series features a large cast of characters created primarily by Kevin Williamson with contributions from Craven and Ehren Kruger. The series focuses on the character of Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and a succession of murderers who adopt a ghost-like disguise, dubbed Ghostface, to taunt and attempt to kill her. The series will comprise of five films: Scream (1996), Scream 2 (1997), Scream 3 (2000), Scream 4 (2011) and the Untitled Scream sequel (2022). Sidney is accompanied in each film by news reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) and town Deputy Sheriff Dewey Riley (David Arquette). Sidney is initially hostile to Gale, because Gale has written a book about the murder of Sidney's mother, but they grow closer in each successive film as they survive Ghostface's murder attempts. In Scream 2 Gale and Dewey initiate a relationship, which leads to a marriage proposal at the end of Scream 3. In Scream 4, ten years later, Sidney has written a self- help book about her experiences, while Dewey has become a Sheriff and is in a strained marriage with Gale, who is struggling to write a new novel. Each film provides a motive and grounds for suspicion for several characters, concealing the identity of the true killer or killers until the finale, in which their identities and motivations are revealed. In Scream, the fictional town of Woodsboro is besieged by a masked killer who focuses on Sidney, revealed in the finale as Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), aided by his friend Stu Macher (Matthew Lillard). Billy admits to being responsible for the murder of Sidney's mother Maureen Prescott, to take revenge for an affair Maureen had with Billy's father that caused his mother to \\"abandon\\" him. In Scream 2, copycat killers again stalk Sidney and her friends, before being revealed as Sidney's friend Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) and Billy Loomis' mother (Laurie Metcalf). In Scream 3, another killer hunts Sidney, claiming to have knowledge of Sidney's tragic past, prior to the events of the original film. The killer is revealed to be Roman Bridger (Scott Foley), Sidney's half- brother, who wants revenge for his rejection and abandonment by their mother. Roman is revealed to have been responsible for convincing Billy to kill Maureen before the events of Scream, setting in motion the events that occur in each successive film. In Scream 4, a killer appears when Sidney returns to Woodsboro on the fifteenth anniversary of the original killings. This killer is revealed to be Sidney's cousin Jill Roberts (Emma Roberts), with horror film fan Charlie Walker (Rory Culkin) as her accomplice. The Scream series has received several awards, including a Saturn Award for Best Actress and an MTV Movie Award for Best Performance for Neve Campbell and a Saturn Award for Best Horror Film for Scream. Scream (1996) Scream is the first film in the Scream series. One year prior to the events of the film, Maureen Prescott is brutally raped and murdered, apparently by Cotton Weary. During the film, the fictional town of Woodsboro is again attacked by a murderer, who particularly targets Sidney Prescott, Maureen's daughter. Deputy Sheriff Dewey Riley investigates the murders, while news reporter Gale Weathers follows the story. Sidney, her boyfriend Billy Loomis and their friends Tatum Riley, Stu Macher and Randy Meeks try to survive the attacks. The killer is revealed as both Billy and Stu, who admit to having killed Maureen and framed Cotton for the act. Sidney then kills them both in retribution. Billy Loomis *Portrayed by Skeet Ulrich *Appeared in: Scream Billy Loomis is a Woodsboro teenager, the boyfriend of Sidney Prescott and an avid fan of horror films. Following a series of murders, Billy becomes a suspect when he is found at Sidney's house with a cellphone shortly after she is taunted on the phone and attacked by a masked killer. Evidence is discovered that points to other characters, and Billy is removed as a suspect. During a party at Stu Macher's home, Billy and Sidney are reconciled and have sex, before Billy is stabbed by Ghostface. Later after a series of attacks, Billy is revealed to be alive and tries to help Sidney, obtaining in the process a gun which he then uses to shoot Randy Meeks. Billy then reveals himself to be the killer, having feigned the injury in the first place, with Stu confessing to be Billy's accomplice. The pair also admit to having murdered Sidney's mother, Maureen Prescott, one year previously, after she had an affair with Billy's father, causing Billy's mother to \\"abandon\\" him. Sidney manages to kill Billy by shooting him in the head. In Scream 2, Billy's mother seeks revenge on Sidney for Billy's death. In Scream 3, Roman Bridger reveals that he provided Billy the evidence of his father's affair and gave him advice on how to kill Maureen. In \\"Stab\\", the fictional film within a film based on the murders, Billy is portrayed by Luke Wilson. The character is parodied in the film Scary Movie as Bobby Prinze, portrayed by Jon Abrahams. Kevin Patrick Walls and Justin Whalin were final contenders for the role of Billy Loomis before it was won by Skeet Ulrich. Walls was instead cast in the minor role of Steve Orth. Casey Becker Barrymore was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Scream. *Portrayed by Drew Barrymore *Appeared in: Scream Casey Becker is a Woodsboro teenager and the former girlfriend of Stu Macher. After receiving a taunting and threatening phone call, she is ordered to answer horror film trivia questions to save the life of her boyfriend, Steve Orth. When she answers incorrectly, Steve is disemboweled and she is asked another question to save her own life. When she refuses to answer, Ghostface chases her down and kills her, leaving her hanged from a tree and disemboweled. Later, it is revealed by Billy Loomis and Stu (who are Casey's Ghostface killers) that even if she answered, they would have killed her anyway. In \\"Stab\\", the fictional film within a film based on the murders, Casey is played by Heather Graham. Barrymore was already a successful actress when she appeared in Scream, at a time when casting a big name for a horror film was uncommon. She was originally signed to play the role of Sidney after reading the script and approaching the production team herself. However she decided she would rather play the part of Casey Becker because of her connection to the character and wanting to deliver a shock to the audience. It was not due to a scheduling conflict even though a very popular rumor states it was. This has been debunked by Barrymore herself as well as Wes Craven. Like her co- stars Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox, her appearance is credited by Craven for raising the profile of the film and helping to attract a larger female audience. Several scenes leading to Casey's eventual death gave rise to disputes between Craven and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), the film rating board, who raised concerns over the violence and intensity of the scene. When she is initially stabbed in the chest by Ghostface, Craven insisted that he had only been able to make one successful take of the scene, so that no substitution was possible; he was, in fact, lying. The scene in which her corpse is hung from a tree and disemboweled was heavily edited: Craven was forced to remove all still shots of the body, and the scene itself was sped up to reduce its time on screen. Cotton Weary *Portrayed by Liev Schreiber *Appeared in: Scream, Scream 2, Scream 3 Cotton Weary was the original suspect in the rape and murder of Maureen Prescott, Sidney's mother. He was identified by Sidney, who found her mother's body after seeing someone she believed to be Cotton leaving her home. In Scream it is revealed that Maureen was having an affair with Cotton before she was murdered by Billy Loomis and Stu Macher, who then planted evidence to frame Cotton. In Scream 2 Cotton attempts to gain fame from his incarceration and exoneration for Maureen's murder, traveling to Windsor College to convince Sidney to agree to an interview. He later saves Sidney when she is about to be murdered by Mrs. Loomis, one of the Ghostface killers in Scream 2. In Scream 3 Cotton has become famous for his exploits, hosting his own talk show. He and his girlfriend Christine are attacked by the latest Ghostface, who demands to know the whereabouts of Sidney Prescott after she goes into hiding. When Cotton refuses to tell, Ghostface kills him. In the original Scream 2 script, Cotton was captured by the real Ghostface killers, Derek, Hallie and Mrs. Loomis. After Mrs. Loomis kills Derek and Hallie, she intends to frame Cotton for the recent murder spree, but he attacks and stabs her to death. He then tries to take revenge on Sidney for his false imprisonment, noting that the evidence points to him being an innocent victim. He and Sidney stab each other, but their fates have not been revealed. Following the leak of the script on the Internet, extensive rewrites were undertaken, changing this plot. Dewey Riley Arquette as his character Dewey Riley on the set of Scream 4 *Portrayed by David Arquette *Appeared in: Scream, Scream 2, Scream 3, Scream 4, Untitled Scream sequel Dwight \\"Dewey\\" Riley is the deputy sheriff of Woodsboro, the brother of Tatum Riley and friend of Sidney Prescott. After a series of murders, he helps lead the investigation, while pursuing a romance with Gale Weathers. He is stabbed by Ghostface during the finale of Scream, but survives. Dewey returns in Scream 2, suffering from a limp and weakened arm caused by nerve damage as a result of his stabbing. He travels to Windsor College to help Sidney after a series of copycat Ghostface murders. He is attacked and stabbed repeatedly by the current Ghostface but again survives. In Scream 3 he aids an investigation into a new Ghostface, later revealed to be Roman Bridger. Dewey shoots Roman in the head, killing him. In the aftermath he asks Gale to marry him, and she accepts. In Scream 4 Dewey has married Gale and returned with her to Woodsboro, becoming the new Sheriff and recovered from his past injuries. After a new series of Ghostface murders on the anniversary of Billy's and Stu's spree, Dewey again investigates. By now his relationship with Gale is strained, but, after Gale is badly injured by Ghostface, they resolve their differences. Dewey had been intended to die in the finale of Scream. However, Craven filmed an additional scene, in which Dewey survives and is placed in an ambulance, in case test audiences reacted positively to the character. When they did, this scene was added to the film. Arquette was originally brought in to audition for the role of Billy Loomis in Scream, but preferred the character of Dewey and requested to audition for that instead. Despite resistance from the production team, who were concerned that the role was described as \\"hunky\\", rather than the younger, goofier approach of Arquette, Craven appreciated the idea and cast him in the role. In Stab, the fictional film within a film based on the Ghostface murders, and again in Stab 3, Dewey is portrayed by David Schwimmer and fictional actor Tom Prinze, respectively. Gale Weathers Cox was starring in the sitcom Friends when she took on the role of Gale Weathers. *Portrayed by Courteney Cox *Appeared in: Scream, Scream 2, Scream 3, Scream 4, Untitled Scream sequel Gale Weathers is a news reporter for the fictional news show \\"Top Story\\". Prior to the events of the films, she was involved in coverage of the murder of Maureen Prescott and the resulting trial of Cotton Weary, during which she criticized the testimony of Sidney Prescott. In Scream she returns to Woodsboro to cover the current murder spree. During the finale of the film, her cameraman, Kenny, is murdered, and she is left for dead after a car crash. She is later revealed to be alive and witnesses the confession of Billy Loomis and Stu Macher to their role in the killings. She helps Sidney defeat Billy and, after the events of the film, writes a new book about the Ghostface murders. In Scream 2 she travels to Windsor College to cover the current murder spree. She witnesses the apparent death of Dewey before she herself is shot by Mickey, one of the killers. She survives and helps Sidney to kill Mickey. In Scream 3 she is shown to have written another book, this time about the Windsor College killings. She travels to Hollywood to aid the investigation of a new series of murders there. At the end of the film, Dewey asks Gale to marry him, and she accepts. In Scream 4, Gale has married Dewey, becoming Gale Weathers-Riley, but their relationship is strained. She has written a series of novels about fictional Ghostface murders; these have been turned into new films in the fictional \\"Stab\\" series. She attempts to reignite her journalistic career by investigating the new murders, but is attacked and badly wounded by the new Ghostface. She survives and resolves her differences with Dewey. In the fictional \\"Stab\\" series of films within a film, Gale is portrayed by fictional actress Jennifer Jolie. Courteney Cox was starring in the NBC sitcom Friends when she was cast in Scream, marking a new trend: casting established and popular actors and actresses in horror films. Craven opined that her presence, like Neve Campbell's, helped raise the profile of Scream and attract a large female audience. Brooke Shields and Janeane Garofalo were the original choices for the role of Gale. Cox was not even considered at first, as it was not believed that she could play Gale's selfish, abusive and aggressive character after playing the softer, nicer role of Monica Geller in Friends. Cox, however, was eager to play a \\"bitch\\" character, specifically to contrast with her Friends character, and repeatedly lobbied the production team until she won the role. Ghostface *Portrayed by Roger L. Jackson (voice), Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Laurie Metcalf, Timothy Olyphant, Scott Foley, Emma Roberts, Rory Culkin *Appeared in: Scream, Scream 2, Scream 3, Scream 4, Untitled Scream sequel Ghostface is a fictional identity, created in Scream by Billy Loomis and Stu Macher to conduct a murder spree in the town of Woodsboro. The costume they use is a generic Halloween costume, officially called \\"Father Death\\", that allows anyone to adopt the identity and makes the killers difficult to identify. The killers taunt their victims on the phone before attacking, using a voice changer to disguise their true identity. While in costume, the character is voiced by voice actor Roger L. Jackson. The Ghostface identity is adopted by other killers after the death of Billy and Stu. In Scream 2 it is taken by Billy's mother and her accomplice, Mickey. In Scream 3 it is taken by Sidney's half-brother, Roman Bridger. In Scream 4, on the anniversary of Billy and Stu's murder spree, a new Ghostface emerges, revealed to be Sidney's cousin Jill Roberts and her friend Charlie Walker. In the finale of each film, the current Ghostface killers confront Sidney and explain their motivation for stalking her. Jackson, who voices Ghostface in all the Scream films, was chosen for the part after weeks of local casting in Santa Rosa, California. He was intended only as a temporary voice, to be replaced in the post-production phase of the film with a dubbed voice, but his contribution was retained because Craven felt he imbued the voice with a truly evil malevolence. He and the casts of the films were intentionally prevented from meeting for most if not all of each film's production, to discourage the cast from putting a face to the voice, and to make him seem more menacing when interacting with the characters on the phone. Kenny *Portrayed by W. Earl Brown *Appeared in: Scream Kenny is Gale Weathers' cameraman on the fictional news show \\"Top Story\\". In Scream Kenny accompanies Gale as she reports on the series of murders in Woodsboro. After seeing on a hidden camera that Randy Meeks is about to be murdered, he leaves his van to help, and his throat is slit by Ghostface. Kenny's neck being slashed was one of the several scenes that had to be toned down by Craven at the behest of the MPAA in order to avoid the restrictive NC-17 rating. The scene was shortened because the MPAA felt that Kenny's expression after his throat was cut was too disturbing. Maureen Prescott *Portrayed by Lynn McRee *Appeared in: Scream, Scream 3 Maureen Prescott (n√©e Roberts) is the mother of Sidney Prescott and wife of Neil Prescott. She is murdered before the events of the Scream films. She conducted several extra-marital affairs, including those with Cotton Weary and Hank Loomis, the father of Billy Loomis. Cotton was arrested and convicted of her murder. In Scream a killer taunts Sidney on the phone about her mother's murder; this killer is later identified as Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis and his friend Stu. Billy reveals that it was he and Stu who murdered Maureen and framed Cotton for it. In Scream 3 the current Ghostface uses Maureen's synthesized voice and image to taunt Sidney and lure her out of hiding. The killer is unveiled as Roman Bridger, who reveals that he is Maureen's son and Sidney's half-brother. For a two-year period in her youth, before she met Sidney's father, Maureen had traveled to Hollywood to become an actress under the pseudonym Rina Reynolds. During this time she was impregnated with Roman by Hollywood producer John Milton, after being gang-raped. She then gave him up for adoption. When the adult Roman found her, she denied she had been Rina and rejected him. Roman then proceeded to film her affairs and showed the footage to Billy before convincing him to kill Maureen, starting the chain of events that occur throughout the Scream films. Scream 4 introduces Maureen's sister Kate Roberts and her niece Jill Roberts. Neil Prescott *Portrayed by Lawrence Hecht *Appeared in: Scream, Scream 3 Neil Prescott is the father of Sidney Prescott and widower of Maureen Prescott. In Scream he leaves Woodsboro on business and later disappears without trace, raising suspicions that he may be the perpetrator of a series of murders in the town. It is revealed in the finale that he was kidnapped by the real killers, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher, who intended to frame him for their crimes. Neil is saved by his daughter. He appears briefly in Scream 3, commenting on Sidney's withdrawal from her friends and life. Scream 4 also introduces his sister-in-law Kate and his niece Jill. In a scene deleted from the fourth film, it is revealed that Neil passed away between the third and fourth movies. Principal Himbry *Portrayed by Henry Winkler *Appeared in: Scream Principal Himbry is the principal of Woodsboro High School, attended by Sidney Prescott and her friends. While in his office, he is attacked by Ghostface and stabbed repeatedly before dying. Scream producer Bob Weinstein had Himbry's death added to the movie after he realized that the film had \\"30 pages of script\\" without a death occurring. By chance, this gave writer Kevin Williamson a reason for the teenagers to leave Stu Macher's party during the film's finale, a plot point Williamson had been struggling to formulate. The language used by Himbry and his aggressive actions towards the students were among several reasons why the film's production was forced to leave Santa Rosa High School: the school board found the film's content unacceptable and did not want it filmed there. Randy Meeks Jamie Kennedy appears in the first three Scream films. *Portrayed by Jamie Kennedy *Appeared in: Scream, Scream 2, Scream 3 Randy Meeks is a Woodsboro teenager. He is a friend of Sidney Prescott, for whom he has romantic feelings, and is an avid fan of horror movies. He uses his knowledge of horror film plots and clich√©s to define the series of murders that occur in Scream, Scream 2 and Scream 3. In Scream he is shot by Billy Loomis but survives. In Scream 2 he attends the fictional Windsor College with Sidney, studying film. When a new series of murders begins, Randy taunts the killer over the phone, mocking Billy Loomis' in the previous film. During this call, the killer dragged him into a van and killed him. It is later revealed that Mrs. Loomis, Billy's mother, killed Randy out of anger at his insults to her son. Randy appears posthumously in Scream 3 in a recorded video, in which he explains to Sidney the \\"rules\\" concerning the latest killer. In the published screenplay for Scream, an alternate ending had Randy (rather than Sidney) kill Billy before asking Sidney out on a date. Before a script leak forced the rewriting of parts of the Scream 2 screenplay, Randy was to be Gale Weathers' cameraman rather than a student as shown in the finished film. His death, however, remained the same. Craven and Ehren Kruger considered bringing Randy back in Scream 3, revealing him to have survived his attack in Scream 2 but abandoned the idea as too unrealistic. Casting for Randy was contested between Kennedy and Breckin Meyer. The production team favored Kennedy, as they believed he had certain qualities that made him more suitable than Meyer for the role. Kennedy, however, had had no major roles prior to Scream, and Dimension Films, the studio producing the films, was eager to have a more prominent actor in the production alongside the other well-known stars such as Barrymore and Cox. The production team itself, however, was adamant that Kennedy was the best choice and fought successfully to keep him in. Sidney Prescott Neve Campbell (pictured) won the Saturn Award for Best Actress for her role in Scream. *Portrayed by Neve Campbell *Appeared in: Scream, Scream 2, Scream 3, Scream 4, Untitled Scream sequel Sidney Prescott is a Woodsboro teenager. In Scream, a year after the murder of her mother Maureen, she is stalked by a killer, later revealed to be her boyfriend Billy Loomis and his friend Stu Macher. These two prove to have been Maureen's murderers, Billy being motivated by Maureen's affair with his father, which caused his mother to leave home. Sidney kills both of them in self-defense. In Scream 2, while attending college, she again becomes the target of a masked killer, this time her boyfriend's friend Mickey and the mother of Billy Loomis, seeking revenge for the death of her son. Once more Sidney manages to survive the attempts on her life. During Scream 3 she is drawn to Hollywood by yet another killer. She discovers that this one is her half-brother Roman Bridger, who wants to kill her out of anger at his abandonment by Maureen. In Scream 4 she returns to Woodsboro to promote her new self-help book about overcoming the tragedies of her life, but is targeted once again by a new Ghostface, who turns out to be her cousin Jill Roberts who's envious of Sidney's fame and wants to become the new \\"Sidney Prescott\\". In the fictional films within a film Stab and Stab 2, based on the murders, Sidney is portrayed by Tori Spelling as herself. In Stab 3 she is portrayed by fictional actress Angelina Tyler, played by Emily Mortimer. Neve Campbell won the Saturn Award for Best Actress in 1997 for her role as Sidney Prescott in Scream and the MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance in 1998 for her role in Scream 2. When she was cast in Scream, Campbell was starring in the television drama series Party of Five. It was previously unheard of to cast an established television actress in a horror film, but, following the success of this casting and that of Courteney Cox, the practice became common in many later horror films. Craven opined that their presence helped raise the profile of Scream and attract a large female audience. Steve Orth *Portrayed by Kevin Patrick Walls *Appeared in: Scream Steven \\"Steve\\" Orth is a Woodsboro teenager and the boyfriend of Casey Becker. He is captured and held hostage by Ghostface, who keeps him bound to a chair outside Casey's home. Casey is made to answer horror-film trivia questions to save his life. When she gets a question wrong, Steve is disemboweled and dies. Walls auditioned for the part of Billy Loomis, but took the smaller role of Steve when Ulrich was cast as Billy. Stu Macher *Portrayed by Matthew Lillard *Appeared in: Scream Stuart \\"Stu\\" Macher is a Woodsboro teenager, the boyfriend of Tatum Riley and best friend of Billy Loomis. Following a series of murders in the town, starting with the killing of Stu's ex-girlfriend Casey Becker, school is suspended. Stu hosts a party at his house to celebrate. At the party, Ghostface murders Tatum. Billy is revealed to be Ghostface, and Stu his accomplice. Stu cites peer pressure as his motivation. Stu tries to kill Sidney, but she drops a television on his head, electrocuting him. Matthew Lillard has an uncredited cameo at a sorority party in Scream 2. He revealed in a 2009 interview that Stu was originally intended to be the killer in Scream 3, having survived his apparent death. From prison he was to orchestrate new Ghostface attacks on high school students, ultimately targeting Sidney. Following the Columbine High School massacre, which took place shortly before production began, this plot was abandoned and the script was rewritten without Stu to avoid presenting violence and murder in a high school setting. Many of Lillard's notable and humorous lines in the film were improvised. He was cast by chance, after accompanying his girlfriend of the time to a separate audition in the facility where Scream auditions were also taking place. Scream casting director Lisa Beach saw Lillard and, believing he had the characteristics required of the character, asked him to audition. Tatum Riley Tatum Riley was one of McGowan's earliest starring roles. *Portrayed by Rose McGowan *Appeared in: Scream Tatum Riley is a Woodsboro teenager, the best friend of Sidney Prescott, the girlfriend of Stu Macher and the sister of town Deputy Dewey Riley. After a series of murders begin in the town, Tatum attempts to protect Sidney from the ensuing media attention, since the killings occurred on the anniversary of the brutal murder of Sidney's mother. Tatum's boyfriend Stu hosts a house party, during which the killer strikes, attacking her in the garage. She tries to escape through a cat door fitted to the automatic garage door, but becomes trapped, and the killer raises the door. Tatum's neck is crushed between the rising door and the top of its frame, killing her. Tatum's death, like those of Casey Becker and Kenny, caused conflict between director Craven and the MPAA film rating board. Craven was ultimately forced to reduce any lingering shots of her body, necessitating a quick visual cutaway once she dies. Actresses Melinda Clarke and Rebecca Gayheart also auditioned for the role. McGowan was cast as Tatum because the production team felt she best embodied the \\"spunky\\" nature of the character. Scream 2 Scream 2 is the second film in the Scream series and is set one year after the Woodsboro murder spree. Sidney Prescott and Randy Meeks now attend the fictional Windsor College as students. \\"Stab\\", a film based on the Woodsboro murders, has just been released, and a copycat murder spree begins during its premiere. The new Ghostface attacks Sidney and her friends, killing Randy and wounding Dewey Riley, before being revealed as Sidney's classmate Mickey and Mrs. Loomis, the mother of Scream killer Billy Loomis. Cici Cooper Sarah Michelle Gellar. *Portrayed by Sarah Michelle Gellar *Appeared in: Scream 2 Casey \\"Cici\\" Cooper is a student at Windsor College. While alone in her sorority house, Cici is attacked by Ghostface. She runs upstairs pursued by the killer, who throws her through a glass door on to a balcony and stabs her twice in the back before picking her up and throwing her over the balcony to her death. From her murder and the preceding murders of Phil Stevens and Maureen Evans, Gale Weathers and Dewey Riley deduce that the new killer is choosing targets with names similar to those of the victims of the original Ghostface killers, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher. Sarah Michelle Gellar admitted in interviews that she signed on to Scream 2 without having read the script, on the basis of the success of the first film. Debbie Salt (Mrs. Loomis) Roseanne when she starred in Scream 2, continuing the trend started in Scream of casting popular and established actresses. *Portrayed by Laurie Metcalf *Appeared in: Scream 2 Debbie Salt is a local news reporter covering the series of murders at Windsor College. In the finale she is revealed to be Mrs. Loomis, Billy's mother, and the copycat Ghostface alongside her accomplice Mickey. Before the events of Scream, she leaves her home after learning of her husband's affair with Sidney's mother Maureen, abandoning Billy and so providing his motivation for his killing spree in Scream. After Billy's death Mrs. Loomis undertakes a physical makeover, losing weight to change her appearance. She then recruits Mickey from a website devoted to serial killers, to enact a plan for revenge against Sidney. She ultimately betrays Mickey and shoots him, claiming to have indulged his desire for fame to gain his help, while she really intends to kill Sidney and then disappear without trace. Cotton Weary intervenes and manages to save Sidney's life by shooting Mrs. Loomis through the throat, killing her. In the original Scream 2 script, Mrs. Loomis worked with Hallie and Derek, not Mickey, though she still killed her allies. She intended to frame Cotton Weary for the murders, but he managed to stab and kill her. After the script leaked on to the Internet, it underwent rewrites that removed this ending. Derek *Portrayed by Jerry O'Connell *Appeared in: Scream 2 Derek is a student at Windsor College, a friend of Mickey and boyfriend of Sidney Prescott. After publicly declaring his love for Sidney, he is captured by his fellow frat brothers and restrained as a prank. During the finale, as Sidney is escaping Ghostface, she finds Derek still restrained and tries to untie him before the killer arrives. Ghostface reveals himself as Mickey and accuses Derek of being his accomplice, causing Sidney to hesitate in freeing him. After Derek threatens Mickey, Mickey shoots him through the heart, killing him. In the original Scream 2 screenplay, Derek was one of the killers working with Mrs. Loomis and Hallie. He and Hallie, who were also secret lovers, shared the motivation of gaining fame for the murders when they were caught, but were both killed by Mrs. Loomis to preserve her anonymity. After the script was leaked on the Internet, it underwent rewrites, removing this ending. Hallie *Portrayed by Elise Neal *Appeared in: Scream 2 Hallie is a student at Windsor College and the best friend of Sidney Prescott. When Sidney is taken into protective custody, Hallie accompanies her, but Ghostface attacks the car in which they are traveling and murders the policemen guarding them. Ghostface hijacks their car, but crashes, rendering himself unconscious and allowing Sidney and Hallie to escape. When Sidney returns to the vehicle to discover the killer's identity, she finds him missing from the car. Ghostface leaps out at Hallie as she waits nearby for Sidney, and stabs her to death. In the original Scream 2 screenplay, Hallie was one of the killers, working with Mrs. Loomis and Derek. She and Derek, who were also secret lovers, shared the motivation of gaining fame for the murders when they were caught, but were both killed by Mrs. Loomis to preserve her anonymity. After the script was leaked on the Internet, it underwent rewrites, removing this ending. Joel *Portrayed by Duane Martin *Appeared in: Scream 2 Joel is Gale Weathers‚Äô new cameraman, replacing Kenny from ‚ÄúScream‚Äù When The Windsor College Murders begin, Joel becomes scared of Gale's need to follow the trail. After he reads her book ‚ÄúThe Woodsboro Murders,‚Äù he becomes even more reluctant, especially when he learns about the fate of Kenny and greatly dislikes it when anybody mentions his name in front of him. He goes to buy some doughnuts and coffee and is shocked to come back and find Randy murdered in his van, passing out once he sees the gruesome sight. Left without his van due to it being an official crime scene and finally being pushed to his limits following Randy's death, he leaves, giving Gale all of the news footage that they had filmed so far and telling her that she needed her \\"head examined\\". At the end of the film, he returns to Gale to once again be her cameraman. In the original Scream 2 screenplay, Joel had a larger role as a member of Sidney Prescott's group of friends. His corpse was found during the film's finale. After this script was leaked on the Internet, it underwent rewrites, changing the role of several characters and making Joel a cameraman. Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens *Portrayed by Jada Pinkett and Omar Epps *Appeared in: Scream 2 Maureen Evans and her boyfriend Phil Stevens are students at Windsor College. They attend a sneak preview of the film \\"Stab\\", during which Phil goes to the bathroom and hears strange whimpering from the next stall. He presses his ear against the divider to listen closer, but a blade is forced through the divider, stabbing Phil in the ear and killing him. The killer, wearing a Ghostface costume, returns to the screening and sits beside Maureen, before mortally stabbing her. The audience believe her to be part of a publicity stunt, until she falls dead in front of the cinema screen. Their deaths are satirized in Scary Movie. Mickey *Portrayed by Timothy Olyphant *Appeared in: Scream 2 Mickey is a student at Windsor College and Derek's best friend. Like Randy Meeks from Scream, he shows an avid interest in horror films and sequels. In the finale he is revealed as the current Ghostface, with his accomplice Mrs. Loomis. He kills Sidney's boyfriend Derek in front of her. Mickey states that he carried out the killings with the intention of getting caught, believing he would receive fame for his deeds and from the resulting trial, and intending to blame film violence for influencing him. Contrary to Mickey's desires, however, Mrs. Loomis intends to disappear after the killings; so she shoots him, seemingly fatally. After Mrs. Loomis' defeat, though, Mickey leaps to his feet to attack Sidney, but is finally killed by Gale and Sidney. In the original Scream 2 script, Mickey was murdered by Ghostface while trying to save Sidney, but this was changed in rewrites after the original script was leaked online. Scream 3 In Scream 3, the third film in the Scream series, a new series of Ghostface murders begins during production of \\"Stab 3\\", a film within a film based on the murders in Scream and Scream 2. Sidney has hidden herself away, and Ghostface leaves photographs of a young Maureen Prescott, her mother, at the crime scenes, hoping to lure her to Hollywood. The killer is revealed as Roman Bridger, Sidney's unknown half-brother and Maureen's son. Roman was conceived after the young Maureen was gang-raped in Hollywood while attempting to become an actress under the pseudonym Rina Reynolds.

Tortorella auditioned five times to secure the role of Trevor by reenacting a scene from Scream where the character of Billy Loomis reveals he is one of the killers. Reception Neve Campbell praised the role of Sidney Prescott, saying she \\"adored\\" the character and \\"she's a fantastic character for any kind of movie.\\" In 1997, the Scream role won Campbell the Saturn Award for Best Actress and an MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance nomination. The following year she went on to win the 1998 Best Female Performance for Scream 2 and received a second nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Actress, losing to Jodie Foster for Contact (1997). She received a third and final Best Female Performance nomination from MTV in 2000 for the character in Scream 3, but lost to fellow Scream alum Sarah Michelle Gellar for Cruel Intentions (1999). Barrymore and Ulrich also received Saturn Award nominations in 1997 for Scream, for Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor respectively. Although critical of the film itself, Variety singled out Campbell and Ulrich for praise as \\"charismatic\\", liking Cox's playing against type as the ambitious reporter Gale and saying the film had a \\"strong ensemble cast\\". John Muir, author of Wes Craven: The Art of Horror, was critical of the new characters introduced in Scream 2 - Derek, Joel, Cici, Hallie, Lois, Murphy and Mickey - stating that they never attained the same depth of character as Scream characters such as Tatum Riley, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher, or even minor characters like Principal Himbry. Muir cited the sequel's focus on increased body counts and violence as the cause of this discrepancy in the quality of the two films' characters. He added that, as a result, Scream 2 lacked the same mystery or intrigue as the original, as the killer could be any character, purely because the audience is never provided with enough information to form an opinion of them. Roger Ebert agreed with this criticism, saying \\"there is no way to guess who's doing the killing, and everyone who seems suspicious is (almost) sure to be innocent.\\" However, Muir praised the development of the surviving characters of Scream, labeling Gale Weathers, Dewey Riley, Sidney Prescott, and Randy Meeks as \\"beloved\\" and claiming that the death of Randy was the most devastating moment of the sequel and a \\"bad move\\". Varietys Leonard Klady was more appreciative of some of the new cast, calling Laurie Metcalf and Liev Schreiber \\"standout\\" talent. Cox received a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination for her role in Scream 2, but lost to Gloria Stuart for Titanic (1997). On the characters of Scream 3, Roger Ebert was critical, stating \\"[the characters] are so thin, they're transparent\\", but he praised Neve Campbell's appearance as Sidney Prescott, saying \\"The camera loves her. She could become a really big star and then giggle at clips from this film at her AFI tribute\\". The New York Times praised her role equally highly, saying \\"She has developed as an actress; when her eyes go dark with concern and fear, she is nerve-racked and tormented, not play-acting.\\" Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News was less complimentary about Campbell, saying \\"She adds ZERO coolness. Zero talent. And Zero charisma to [Scream 3].\\" The BBC's Tom Coates and Elvis Mitchell of the New York Times praised Parker Posey's character, with Mitchell saying \\"[Jennifer Jolie] alone makes the picture worth seeing. Dizzy and nakedly ‚Äì hilariously ‚Äì ambitious, she's so flighty she seems to be levitating.\\" So well received was Posey's character that she received an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance nomination in 2000 for the role, although she lost to Adam Sandler for Big Daddy (1999). Mitchell also praised the characters of Sarah Darling (McCarthy), Tyson Fox (Richmond) and Steven Stone (Warbuton), calling them \\"assets\\" to the film. In 2001, as part of the American Film Institute's AFI 100 Years... series, the character of Ghostface became one of the four hundred nominees in the \\"100 Heroes and Villains\\" category. On the characters of Scream 4, Film 4 complimented the new additions to the cast, isolating Robbie Mercer and Charlie Walker as the best of the new characters, while the Los Angeles Times called Panettiere's film-nerd Kirby Reed \\"feisty\\", labeling her the most \\"intriguing\\" new addition to the series. The first season of Scream has received an mixed response from critics. On the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, it has a rating of 47%, based on 29 reviews, with a 5.4/10 average rating. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Lacking truly compelling characters or scenarios, Scream is formed to trade too heavily on nostalgia for its big-screen predecessors in the franchise.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the series has a score of 57 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". In a positive review, David Hinckley from New York Daily News awarded the pilot four out of five stars and stated, \\"Happily, Scream maintains a sense of humor, reinforced with snappy, self-aware pop culture dialogue.\\" Similarly, Brian Lowry of Variety commended the show's ability to maintain suspense \\"without much actually happening during the rest of the episode,\\" noting its use of music, but expressing skepticism if the series could maintain its originality. Aedan Juvet of PopWrapped gave a positive assessment of the series and called it, \\"a prime example of a game-changing horror series.\\" Conversely, David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle panned the series and gave it one out of four stars, criticizing the acting performances as \\"bland, robotic, and uninteresting\\" as well as its apparent lack of racial diversity. In a mixed review, Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald gave the show a C+, saying, \\"There are a few scares here, but while the Scream films kept audiences jumping, Scream: The TV series risks putting viewers to sleep.\\" ReferencesExternal links    * * Category:Wes Craven characters Scream characters ","title":"List of Scream (film series) characters"},{"id":"12750949","text":"Brecht Capon (born 22 April 1988) is a Belgian football striker who currently plays for KV Oostende.

In 2008, PBS will air three one-hour specials under the Americans at War banner. These will be Americans at War: Vietnam hosted by Joe Galloway, Americans at War: The Doolittle Raid hosted by David Hartman, and Americans at War: Pearl Harbor. Interviewees * Edwin C.

The instruction set of an ASIP is tailored to benefit a specific application. This specialization of the core provides a tradeoff between the flexibility of a general purpose CPU and the performance of an ASIC. Some ASIPs have a configurable instruction set. Usually, these cores are divided into two parts: static logic which defines a minimum ISA (instruction-set architecture) and configurable logic which can be used to design new instructions. The configurable logic can be programmed either in the field in a similar fashion to an Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or during the chip synthesis. ASIPs can be used as an alternative of hardware accelerators for baseband signal processingShahabuddin, Shahriar et al., \\"Design of a transport triggered vector processor for turbo decoding\\", Springer Journal of Analog Integrated Circuits and Signal Processing, March 2014. or video coding. Hautala, Ilkka, et al. \\"Programmable Low-Power Multicore Coprocessor Architecture for HEVC/H.265 In-Loop Filtering\\" in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, November 2014 Traditional hardware accelerators for these applications suffer from inflexibility. It is very difficult to reuse the hardware datapath with handwritten finite-state machines (FSM). The retargetable compilers of ASIPs help the designer to update the program and reuse the datapath. Typically, the ASIP design is more or less dependent on the tool flow because designing a processor from scratch can be very complicated. There are some commercial tools to design ASIPs, for example Processor Designer from Synopsys. There is an open source tool as well, TTA-based co-design environment (TCE).

In the 2nd century it was part of the Novempopulania, one of the seventeen provinces of Gaul. The diocese must have been created between the first and the third centuries, but because of the large numbers of invaders that passed through this region - Arians, Saracens, Normans - the list of bishops is much reduced during the first millennium. The first bishop of this diocese is mentioned, without a name, by Gregory of Tours in his De gloria martyrum. The diocese of Bazas, the seat of which was the cathedral of Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Bazas, was bordered on the north by the diocese of P√©rigueux, on the east by the diocese of Agen and the diocese of Condom, on the south by the diocese of Aire and the diocese of Dax, and on the west by the archdiocese of Bordeaux. It was divided into three archdeaconries. It was suppressed during the French Revolution by the Legislative Assembly, under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790). By the Concordat of 1801 its territory was unequally divided between the dioceses of Aire, Agen and Bordeaux. The title of the diocese of Bazas was preserved and assigned to the Archdiocese of Bordeaux-Bazas.

Gunung Halimun National Park is located within the borders of the Sukabumi Regency, Bogor and southern Banten province. The Kasepuhan is called \\"Kasepuhan Banten Kidul\\" (Kasepuhan of Southern Banten), their main village is Ciptagelar in the Cisolok subdistrict (kecamatan) in the western part of the Sukabumi Regency. The current head of the community, Abah Ugih, inherited the position of leader when his father, Abah Anom, died at the age of 54.J. Adiguna, 'Living in harmony with the nature' , The Jakarta Post, 11 August 2008. Etymology The word kasepuhan is formed on sepuh, which means \\"old\\" in the Sundanese language. It refers to a way of living based on ancestral traditions and eventually, to the local community who lives according to these traditions. History and tradition According to oral information, the Kasepuhan have lived in this area (Banten Kidul, or south Banten) since 1368. The ancestors of the Kasepuhan are said to have lived in the area of Bogor, east of Gunung Halimun. At that time, their ancestors were part of a kingdom that encompassed the province of West Java and Banten. The people of the Kasepuhan claim they are linked with the Baduy, another traditional group in West Java. The main belief system of Kasepuhan people is Sunda Wiwitan. Nowadays, the Kasepuhan are influenced by Islam. However they do not strictly follow all rules of Islam but, rather, combine their beliefs with animism and Sundanese traditions. Just as their ancestors, they have combined several traditions and religions with their own Kasepuhan tradition; that is, they are influenced by Islam, Sundanese traditions, Pajajaran traditions and thus Hinduism and also animism. The main ritual of Kasepuhan community is Seren Taun, or rice harvest thanksgiving as well as marking the new agriculture year in Sundanese tradition. Seren Taun festival also celebrated by other Sundanese traditional communities in other areas such as Sundanese community in Cigugur Kuningan.Seren Taun Bogor The Kasepuhan history existed since 1368 (note: the years allowed to write down) their believe before that time also they still have story, but enough to lets other peoples known only from that time. the areas of the kingdom called \\" Banten Kidul\\" its a territories before the government age, and now this Banten Kidul area on three sub district areas ( Lebak, Bogor and Sukabumi) The peoples in Kasepuhan still living in the tradition and ancient cultures role of custom, following what the ancestor said for their life and living on rice plantation. the rice they have to plan is only rice seed from the ancestor ( data 2014: there are 167 original varieties) planting till today, and more than 300 new varieties from natural mixing on the rice field. By far the most important way of subsistence for the Kasepuhan is agriculture, which can split into two categories: ' Huma (Dry rice cultivation), Sawah (wet rice cultivation). the Dry system rice plantation is the original way plantation from the ancestor, and since the Dutch time then they have wets system rice plantation called \\"Sawah\\". About 85% of Kasepuhan agricultural land is sawah, 10% consists of ladang, and 5% kebun.

One of the six BBC Performing Groups, the BBC Singers are based at the BBC's Maida Vale Studios in London. The only full-time professional British choir, the BBC Singers feature in live concerts, radio transmissions, recordings and education workshops. The choir often performs alongside other BBC Performing Groups, such as the BBC Symphony Orchestra, and is a regular guest at the BBC Proms. Broadcasts are given from locations around the country, including St Giles-without-Cripplegate and St Paul's Knightsbridge. The BBC Singers regularly perform alongside leading international orchestras and conductors, and makes invitational appearances at national events such as the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in Westminster Abbey. Notable former members of the group include Sir Peter Pears, Sarah Connolly, Judith Bingham and Harry Christophers.  History  In 1924, the BBC engaged Stanford Robinson as Chorus Master. He formed a choir for a performance of Rutland Boughton's Immortal Hour. This choir, known as 'The Wireless Chorus', was thereafter established as a full-time professional choir. In 1927, the BBC created an octet named 'The Wireless Singers', drawn from members of the Wireless Chorus, for performances where fewer singers were required. Guest conductors of both groups during these early years included Sir Edward Elgar, Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg and John Barbirolli. In 1931, the Wireless Chorus was invited to perform at the Festival of the International Society for Contemporary Music, the first time this event had been held in Britain. Following the success of the event, it went on to establish themselves as the leading proponents of contemporary music in the UK, a reputation upheld by the BBC Singers today. With the arrival of Leslie Woodgate as general chorus master in 1934, the group was renamed the BBC Singers, and divided into two octets, known as Singers A and Singers B, one specialising in less standard repertoire including Renaissance polyphony and madrigals, the other in light music and revue numbers. Singers A were typically paid ¬£1 per week more than Singers B. In 1939, Woodgate described the operation and function of the various BBC choirs, including the professional choir, in an interview with The Musical Times. JSTOR archive. During the Second World War, the choir was forced to relocate several times from its base in Maida Vale, briefly taking up residence in Bristol, Bangor and Bedford. In 1945, the choir gave the premiere of Francis Poulenc's wartime cantata Figure humaine from the Concert Hall of Broadcasting House. After the war, from the late 1940s onwards, the BBC Singers began to tour across Europe, under the direction of conductors such as Herbert von Karajan, Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler and Bruno Walter. In England, the choir it worked with George Enescu, Sir Thomas Beecham, Otto Klemperer and Igor Stravinsky. From 1946, they became a regular feature of the BBC's new radio arts network, the Third Programme. During the middle years of the twentieth century, the choir premiered major works by Darius Milhaud, Frank Martin, Paul Hindemith, Gerald Finzi, Sir Michael Tippett, Pierre Boulez, Sir Arthur Bliss and Karol Szymanowski. Pierre Boulez began a lifelong association with the choir in 1964. Woodgate died in 1961. That same year, Peter Gellhorn took over the choir. He re-organised the professional contingent, scrapping the A-B division in favour of a single force of 28 voices, which was renamed the 'BBC Chorus'. Following the appointment of John Poole as chorus master in 1972, the choir reverted to its previous name, the 'BBC Singers'. The appointment of Bo Holten as Guest Conductor in 1991 introduced a new focus and approach to Early Music. The BBC Singers now work regularly with Early Music specialists, including Peter Phillips (Tallis Scholars) and Robert Hollingworth (I Fagiolini). Stephen Cleobury, chief conductor of the choir from 1995 to 2007, now has the title of conductor laureate with the choir. Bob Chilcott is the current principal guest conductor of the choir. David Hill was the most recent conductor from 2007 to 2017. Sofi Jeannin first guest-conducted the choir in January 2017. In May 2017, the BBC announced her appointment as the choir's next chief conductor, the first woman to be named to the post, effective July 2018.

Most men died of suffocation underground as the fire consumed their oxygen; a total of 168 miners were killed. The Butte, Montana copper mines were at full wartime production to support the US in the Great War. Miners had been seeking improved working conditions, as they were at high risk. As part of a fire safety system, the mining company was installing an electric cable into the Granite Mountain mine. The cable fell in an area approximately below the surface and was damaged. When a foreman with a carbide lamp tried to inspect the damage, he accidentally ignited the oil-soaked cloth insulation on the cable. The fire quickly climbed the cable, and turned the shaft into a chimney, igniting the timbers in the shaft and consuming oxygen in the mines. A total of 168 miners died in the ensuing blaze, most from asphyxia. Some of the deceased did not die immediately; they survived for a day or two in the tunnels. Some left notes written while they waited in hopes of rescue. A few managed to barricade themselves behind bulkheads in the mine and were found after as long as 55 hours. The miners went out on strike to protest working conditions and the many deaths after the disaster.Punke, Michael. Fire and Brimstone. A Granite Mountain Speculator Mine Memorial, honoring the miners killed in the fire, was later erected at the site. Some of the notes written by the miners can be viewed at the site. The monument is located at .Mine Memorial Metal Mine Workers' Union The Metal Mine Workers' Union developed from the labor unrest in Butte, Montana in 1917. The copper mines of Butte produced a strong union presence in the city; by 1887, all of the city's mines were unionized. This \\"closed shop\\" persisted until 1914 when internal struggles destroyed the once powerful Butte Miners' Union of the Western Federation of Miners and opened the mines to corporate control. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Several days after the Speculator disaster, miners began to walk off the job at copper mines all over the city in protest of the poor working conditions. A meeting was organized and the Metal Mine Workers' Union, an unaffiliated and independent union, formed less than two weeks after the Speculator Mine fire. The new union immediately petitioned the Anaconda Copper Company and its subsidiaries for recognition of their union, demanding safer working conditions and wage increases. By the end of June, other trade unions, including the Electricians, Boilermakers, Blacksmiths, and Metal Trades Machinists of Butte, joined the miners in their strike. The companies resisted the mining union organizers' efforts and chose to work with the other trade unions, acquiescing to many of their demands in hopes of isolating the miners' union and forcing and end to the strike. Around this time, Frank Little, an American labor leader and member of the Industrial Workers of the World, arrived in Butte to support the miners. By the end of July, most of the other trade unions had reached a deal and returned to work. Little, for his support of the miners, was killed by six masked men on August 1, 1917. The miners' union continued to strike through 1917, however, many miners returned to work before its official end. The Metal Mine Workers' Union officially called off the strike on December 18, 1917. In popular culture The disaster was memorialized in the song \\"Rox in the Box\\" on the album The King is Dead (2011) by The Decemberists, an indie rock band. It has also been memorialized in the song \\"The Miners\\" by independent Celtic recording artists The Elders and is featured on their album Story Road (2014). For the centennial of the disaster, it was memorialized in the song \\"Tap 'er Light\\" by Montana singer songwriter Nick Spear. He performed the song at the Granite Mountain Speculator Mine Memorial above Butte on June 8th, 2017.

This allows the use of additional services like Mobile TV and PKI, which need authentication and secured communication. GBA/GAA Setup The setup and function to deploy a generic security relation as described is called Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) or Generic Authentication Architecture (GAA). In short, it consists of the following elements. * user equipment (UE), e. g. a mobile cellular telephone; needs access to a specific service * application server (NAF: Network Application Function), e. g. for mobile TV; provides the service * BSF (Bootstrapping Server Function); arranges security relation between UE and NAF * mobile network operator's Home Subscriber Server (HSS); hosts user profiles. In this case, the term 'bootstrapping' is related to building a security relation with a previously unknown device first and to allow installing security elements (keys) in the device and the BSF afterwards. Workflow The BSF is introduced by the application server (NAF), after an unknown UE device is trying to get service access: the NAF refers the UE to the BSF. UE and BSF mutually authenticate via 3GPP protocol AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement); additionally, the BSF sends related queries to the Home Subscriber Server (HSS). Afterwards, UE and BSF agree on a session key to be used for encrypted data exchange with the application server (NAF). When the UE again connects to the NAF, the NAF is able to obtain the session key as well as user-specific data from the BSF and can start data exchange with the end device (UE), using the related session keys for encryption. Standards BSF is standardised in recent versions of 3GPP Standards: GAA (Generic Authentication Architecture) and GBA (Generic Bootstrapping Architecture), and 3GPP TS 33.919, 33.220 24.109, 29.109 External links * DVB-H News * BMCO forum * Open Mobile Alliance * 3GPP * BSF in LTE network ** castLabs (commercial BSF supplier) ** Nexcom Systems (OEM commercial BSF supplier) ** 3GPP TS 24.109 version 8.3.0 Release 8 Category:Mobile telecommunications standards ","title":"Bootstrapping Server Function"},{"id":"12751306","text":"Torger Hovi (23 January 1905 - 19 October 1980) was a Norwegian politician for the Labour Party.

It lies some two miles northwest of the port of Fishguard and is inside the boundaries of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. History Ancient and ritualistic remains are scattered about the area of the parish, indicating occupation from prehistoric times. The hamlet of Trefasser, according to topographer Samuel Lewis, was stated to be the birthplace of Asser, the biographer of the 9th century king of Wessex, Alfred the Great. In about 1076, forces of north and south Wales met in battle, with the north Welsh victorious. Lewis also noted that Gerald of Wales was incumbent in the parish for a time in the 12th century. 1620 Welsh Bible To the north of the village is the rocky outcrop of Garnwnda, which was the site of a French soldiers' camp during the Battle of Fishguard in 1797. A tattered Welsh Bible of 1620, in Llanwnda church, is said to have been rescued from the hands of the French invaders. On the north side of Garnwnda is a prominent cromlech excavated by John Fenton in 1847. Parish The coastal parish of Llanwnda (as Llanunda) appears on a 1578 parish map of Pembrokeshire. Included in the parish are numerous small settlements and the town of Goodwick as well as the village of Llanwnda. The most northerly point is Strumble Head. Lewis, in his 1833 Topographical Dictionary of Wales, noted the population of the parish as 1,046. The parish church of St Gwyndaf, situated in a walled churchyard, has mediaeval origins and was extensively restored in the 19th century. It is a Grade II* listed building. In popular culture Trehilyn farmhouse Llanwnda came to a degree of national prominence in the summer of 2007 following the purchase of a semi- derelict farmhouse (Trehilyn) by the broadcaster Griff Rhys Jones and the ensuing BBC television documentary, A Pembrokeshire Farm, which recorded its restoration.

Miller should not to be confused with his contemporary Rev William Baird Millar/er, who belonged to the United Presbyterian Church of Victoria 1851‚Äì53, and never held a charge but engaged chiefly in teaching. Life and ministry He was born on 4 August 1815 in East Kilpatrick the son of John Miller and Isabella Wilson. He studied Divinity at New College, Edinburgh.Ewing, William Annals of the Free Church Miller was licensed by the Free Church of Scotland Presbytery of Linlithgow on 14 August 1849, and was ordained for Melbourne, Victoria on 17 April and arrived in Melbourne on 11 September. He was received by the Free Presbyterian Church of Victoria on 22 September, and appointed to the oversight of the John Knox Church in Swanston Street, its founding minister James Forbes having died the previous month. His ministrations were so acceptable that the congregation soon extended a call to him, which he accepted, and was inducted into the charge on 16 December. Miller laboured faithfully as a minister of the Free Presbyterian Church of Victoria, and was spoken of as \\"highly esteemed\\", \\"possessing good abilities\\", \\"amiable in character\\" and \\"commanding the love and respect of the community\\". However, he did not have the vision or capacity of James Forbes. Miller had arrived in Melbourne the same day as Robert Lawson, the rector appointed by the Free Church of Scotland for the Academy planned by James Forbes and later known as Scotch College. On 9 November 1851 the Free Presbyterian Synod appointed Miller Convener of the Academy Committee (the other members were the members of the Session of John Knox Church), and so he may be regarded as the first Chairman of the College Council. In 1853 Miller, along with Rev Duncan MacDiarmid Sinclair (1816-1887), Rev John Tait (1809-60), John Armstrong (1810-1857) of Bush Station and Archibald Bonar, merchant, were appointed the first trustees of the East Melbourne site of Scotch College. Miller was subsequently replaced as Convener of the Academy Committee by Dr. Adam Cairns (1802-1881). In 1853, Miller was appointed to the church committee which was to investigate and potentially negotiate the basis for union with the various Presbyterian denominations in Victoria. A union basis between the Free Presbyterian Church of Victoria and the Church of Scotland Synod of Victoria was drafted, but by 1856 Miller opposed further negotiations due to disputation over the doctrinal standards, legislative basis and ministerial supply. The John Knox congregation supported this stand by resolution at a congregational meeting in August 1856. Of his own denomination, \\"he hoped they would have grace and courage to maintain their own integrity and consistency by refusing all further negotiations until this point (i.e. the legislative basis) should be conceded\\". Miller and several other opponents of union on the proposed basis were expelled by the majority in April 1857, through an apparently illegal motion of 26 paragraphs by Dr. Cairns. A minority synod of the Free Presbyterian Church of Victoria, of which Miller became the moderator on 14 April continued. It became the only Free Presbyterian Synod when the majority, with the blessing of the Free Church of Scotland, entered into the union forming the Presbyterian Church of Victoria in April 1859 on a basis drawn up in 1858. Funds were raised to send Miller to Scotland to represent the interests of the minority at the May 1860 Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland. The Assembly would not receive him as a deputy of the Free Presbyterian Church of Victoria, but only as one of a body \\"calling itself\\" the Free Presbyterian Church of Victoria. This he declined. On the advice of friends, he appealed to appear by way of petition as an individual. The Assembly urged reconciliation and reunion. The rebuff by the Assembly did not help stability in the Victorian Synod, and this was aggravated by the May 1861 Assembly undertaking, by a vote of 341 to 64, to recognise the minority only if they ceased to claim they represented the position formerly occupied by the Free Presbyterian Church of Victoria. In May 1864 the Free Presbyterian Synod divided down the middle and Miller took the side of those who thought union with the Presbyterian Church of Victoria was appropriate. At the close of the year he submitted his resignation from the ministry of John Knox Church, citing the poor health of his wife, although the difficult church situation must also have been relevant. The congregation sided with those opposed to union but ultimately joined the union church in 1867 through the influence of a visiting Scottish minister, Rev James Oswald Dykes (1835-1912). The kind of union that occurred in Victoria in 1859 did not occur in Scotland until 1900 and 1929. Miller returned to Britain around March 1865, where he served the English Presbyterian Church at St Helens, Lancashire for some years, before he retired to Callander in Scotland. He suffered a heart attack during a journey, and died at the newly constructed Callander railway station on 10 August 1874 aged 59. Family He married Mary Brisbane (1818-1894), an industrial school teacher from Paisley, in West Calder on 21 March 1851. No children have been identified to date.

Specifically those under medical care within a medical establishment or those under the care of a medical professional regardless of location ( under care of paramedics at home, family doctor via phone, etc. ). There are many debates that arise from pregnancy rights, ranging from whether or not fertility treatments are ‚Äòright‚Äô or whether using surrogate mothers is wrong. It comes down to the mother‚Äôs right. As a woman, there are more challenges than just the fundamentals of the decisions surrounding their pregnancy. Maternity leave, parental leave and the time allotted for these leaves varies from company to company. The International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) gathered in Cairo in September 1994 to discuss and ‚Äúformulate a consensus position on population and development for the next 20 years‚Äù. One of the other goals was to make education and medical services available to women while they are pregnant, and when the time comes, have delivery options available. A main concern has always been postnatal care; people think that the hardest part is the birth of the child but there are so many additional concerns once the child is born and brought into this world. Complications both prior to pregnancy, during delivery, and after delivery are a potential concern in all births, the ICPD talked about enhancing the available support for all women. Pregnancy rights throughout the world are not going to be the same in every single place but the ICPD is aiming to eliminate discrimination during pregnancy and make all pregnant patients‚Äô rights available to everyone. Nurses and patients sometimes run into troubles because their opinions will often vary in what they think should be done in terms of termination or pre/post natal care. As Kane, 2009 states ‚ÄúThe NMC code of professional conduct states that: ‚Äòyou must make the care of people your first concern‚Äù‚Äô enforcing that the nurses opinions really should be kept to themselves so as to not influence the decision of the patients.  Rights in Australia  In Australia pregnant women have the same rights as any other member of society. However, they do have some extra rights when it comes to their rights in the workforce.  Pregnant women' rights in the workforce  Under the Fair Work Act 2009 section pregnant women are still entitled to the same amount of sick leave as any other individual as being pregnant does not classify as an illness. A Pregnant woman however is able to take unpaid leave for \\"special maternity leave\\", this is maternity leave that she can take if she has a pregnancy related illness or the pregnancy ends any time after the first trimester due to a miscarriage, a stillbirth or a termination. Safe jobs is when the women moves to a safer job while being because her original job is dangerous to her and the baby. She will need to provide evidence that she can still work but unable to perform the original tasks and how long she shouldn't work in her job for. An example for proving these would be with a medical certificate. In the circumstances where there is no safer jobs to offer the women can take no safe jobs leave. The employee takes paid leave if she is entitled to unpaid parental leave and unpaid leave if she is not. Discrimination in the workforce against pregnant women is illegal. This means that she can not be fired, lose hours, demoted and treated differently because of her pregnancy.  Terminating the pregnancy  In Australia the laws on termination change between each state and territory. In Western Australia termination is considered lawful up until 20 weeks of pregnancy. A termination after 20 weeks can only be undertaken if there is two medical practitioners from a panel of six that agree that the women or the fetus has or will have a serious medical condition if the pregnancy continued.  Immunisation  During pregnancy, women have the right to seek getting immunised with the influenza vaccine \\"Flu Shot\\" and the adult dTpa vaccine (pertussis). Both of these vaccines are recommended however it is up to the individual whether or not to go ahead with the vaccinations. References 5\\\\. Federal Register of Legislation. (2009). Fair Work act.

Greece, like all other Balkan states, adopted restrictive policies towards its minorities, namely towards its Slavic population in its northern regions, as a result of the aftermath of Second Balkan war and the potential threat that Bulgaria could pose in the fear of using the pro- Bulgarian oriented minority in Greece as a subversive Fifth Column. After the Balkan Wars and especially after the First World War more than 100,000 Bulgarians from Greek Macedonia moved to Bulgaria, as part of the population exchange policy between the two countries. During the 1930s a new identity parallel to the Greek and Bulgarian ones began to arose in the region of Macedonia, the Slav Macedonian (Greek: Œ£ŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒøŒºŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒ¥œåŒΩŒ±œÇ) and was initially supported by IMRO (United).The Situation in Macedonia and the Tasks of IMRO (United) - published in the official newspaper of IMRO (United), \\"–ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–æ –¥–µ–ª–æ\\", –ù–æ.185, –ê–ø—Ä–∏–ª 1934 In 1934 the Comintern issued a declaration supporting the development of the new Macedonian identity,\\"–†–µ–∑–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏—è –æ –º–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–∏ (–ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è—Ç–æ–π –ë–∞–ª–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–º —Å–µ–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–∞—Ç–µ –ö–æ–º–∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–∞)\\" - –§–µ–≤—Ä–∞–ª—å 1934 –≥, –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ which was admitted by the Greek Communist Party. During the 1930s under the Metaxas Regime, the government endorsed violence by nationalist bands, which sowed the seeds of bitterness that kept brewing within the local Slav-speaking population which found the opportunity to come into effect during the Second World War and the occupation of Greece by the Axis forces. Bulgarian occupation and policy in Greece Triple Occupation of Greece. In 1941 Greek Macedonia was occupied by German, Italian and Bulgarian troops. The Bulgarians occupied the Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace, an area of 14,430 square kilometers, with 590,000 inhabitants. The Bulgarian policy was to win the loyalty of the Slav inhabitants and to instill them a Bulgarian national identity. Indeed, some of these people did greet the Bulgarians as liberators, particularly in eastern and central Macedonia, yet the campaign was less successful in German-occupied western Macedonia.Loring M. Danforth. The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1995. . p. 73. At that time most of them felt themselves to be Bulgarians, irrespective of ideological affiliation.The struggle for Greece, 1941-1949, Christopher Montague Woodhouse, C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 2002, , p. 67. However, in contrast with the population of Vardar Macedonia, smaller fraction of the Slav population collaborated in the Greek part of Macedonia, whether in the Bulgarian-occupied eastern section or the German and Italian-occupied zones. Nevertheless, Bulgarian expansionism was better received in some frontier districts, where strong pro-Bulgarian oriented Slav-speakers lived (in Kastoria, Florina and Pella districts). The Thessaloniki Bulgarian club During the same year, The German High Command approved the foundation of a Bulgarian military club in Thessalon√≠ki. The Bulgarian organised supplies of food and provisions for the Slavic-speaking population in Greek Macedonia, aiming to gain the hearts and minds of the local population that was in the German- and Italian-occupied zones. The Bulgarian clubs soon started to gain support among parts of the population. In 1942, the Bulgarian club asked assistance from the High Command in organising armed units among the Slavic- speaking population in northern Greece.Hugh Poulton. Who are the Macedonians? C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 1995, , p. 109 For this purpose, the Bulgarian army, under the approval of the Commander of the German forces in the Balkans - Field Marshal List sent a handful of officers from the Bulgarian Army, to the zones occupied by the Italian and German troops (central and west Greek Macedonia) to be attached to the German occupying forces as \\"liaison officers\\". All the Bulgarian officers brought into service were locally born Macedonians who had immigrated to Bulgaria with their families during the 1920s and 30s as part of the Greek-Bulgarian treaty of the Neuilly which saw 90,000 Bulgarians migrating to Bulgaria from Greece and 50,000 Greeks moving the opposite direction. Most were members of pro-Bulgarian IMRO and followers of Ivan Mihailov.These officers were given the objective to form armed Slavophone militias.

The name given to the bands armed was 'Ohrana' which in Bulgarian is defined as 'security'. The uniforms of the Ohranists were supplied by the Italians and were resplendent with shoulder patches bearing the inscription \\"Italo-Bulgarian Committee ‚Äî Freedom or Death\\". The Kastorian unit was called the Macedonian Committee. The reasons of locals for taking arms varied. Some of the men were pre-war members of IMRO, and thus harbored deep nationalistic convictions, others because of pro-Nazi sentiments, some to avenge wrongdoings inflicted on them by Greek authorities during the Metaxas regime, and many took arms in order to defend themselves from the attacks of other Greek paramilitary and resistance movements as the latter saw them as collaborators with the Italian, Bulgarian and German forces. Bulgarian collaborationist bands participated in reprisal missions together with the Nazi troops in the region. In one occasion together with the 7th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment they were responsible for a major massacre in the village of Klisoura near Kastoria, that cost the lives of 250 women and children. The Edessa and Florina Ohrana detachments After their initial success in arming several villages in Kastoria, Kalchev went to the German occupied zone in order to start arming villages in Edessa region.IMRO Militia And Volunteer Battalions Of Southwestern Macedonia, 1943-1944 by Vic Nicholas In Edessa, with the help of the German occupation authorities, Kalchev created the Ohrana para-military unit. In 1943, Ohrana detachments counted a total of around 3,000 members and organized guerrilla activity. In the tradition of the IMRO Komitadjis, these bands pursued the local Greek population, including Greek-identifying Slavophones, Aromanians, and Pontic Greeks, seeing them as an obstacle to an all-Bulgarian Macedonia.IMRO Militia And Volunteer Battalions Of Southwestern Macedonia, 1943-1944.

Bulgaria during WWII. Ohrana activity In the summer of 1944, Ohrana constituted some 12,000 local fighters and volunteers from Bulgaria charged with protection of the local population.\\"Macedonia and Bulgarian National Nihilism ‚Äî Ivan Alexandrov\\" (Macedonian Patriotic Organization ‚ÄúTA‚Äù Australia Inc. 1993) During 1944, whole Slavophone villages were armed by the occupation authorities to counterbalance the emerging power of the resistance and especially of Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS). Ohrana was also fighting pro-communist Slavic Macedonians.Unlike the activists of the right IMRO of Ivan Mihailov who declared themselves as Bulgarians, the communist orientated Slavic-spacing population of Greece declared themselves as Ethnic Macedonians - ŒìŒπŒ¨ œÑŒø Œ∂ŒÆœÑŒ∑ŒºŒ± œÑœâŒΩ Œ£ŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒøŒºŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒ¥œåŒΩœâŒΩ ‚Äî Œ°Œ≠ŒΩŒΩŒøœÇ ŒúŒπœáŒ±ŒªŒ≠Œ±œÇ, ŒïŒõŒëŒ£, ŒòŒµœÉœÉŒ±ŒªŒøŒΩŒØŒ∫Œ∑ 13.XI.1944 (œÉŒµŒª. 1, œÉŒµŒª. 2, œÉŒµŒª. 3, œÉŒµŒª. 4, œÉŒµŒª. 5) and Greek communists ‚Äî members of the ELAS.–ï–≥–µj—Å–∫–∏ –±—É—Ä–∏ ‚Äî –†–µ–≤–æ–ª—É—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–µ—Ä–Ω–æ—Ç–æ –¥–≤–∏–∂–µ—ö–µ –≤–æ –í–æ–¥–µ–Ω—Å–∫–æ –∏ –ù–û–§ –≤–æ –ï–≥–µj—Å–∫–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—Ü–∞.

Nevertheless, in the summer of 1944, members of the Macedonian faction of the Communist Party of Greece were unable to distinguish friend from foe in Slav Macedonian villages. Mass involvement of the population was one of the tactics of Ohrana, which thus aims to provide good cover for its activities.British Officer Evans. December Report, AV, II, 413 Ohrana and Mihailov's plans for Macedonia Ohrana was supported from Ivan Mihaylov too. In August 1943, Ivan Mihailov left Zagreb incognito for Germany where he was to visit the main headquarters of the Sicherheitsdienst. From German information, it is apparent that Mihailov received consent to create battalions consisting of volunteers armed with German weapons and munitions. Moreover, these battalions were to be under the operative command and disposal of Reichsfuhrer of the SS, Heinrich Himmler. Additionally, in Sofia talks were held between high-ranking functionaries of the SS and the IMRO Central Committee members. Despite the confidential character of the negotiations between Mihailov and the Sicherheitsdienst, the Bulgarian government obtained certain information about them. In this connection to the village companies in these counties, there was also formed three volunteer battalions in Kastoria, Florina and Edessa. These were organized by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization–ü—Ä–æ—Ñ. –î–æ–±—Ä–∏–Ω –ú–∏—á–µ–≤. –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª–Ω–æ –¥–µ–ª–æ –≤ –Æ–≥–æ–∑–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—è (1941 ‚Äì 1944 –≥.) and were to carry the name \\"IMRO Volunteer Battalions\\". They were formed after the arrival of the IMRO cadres from the Sofia. Re-organization and clashes with ELAS In spring 1944, the Germans taking up where the Italians left off, reformed, re-organized and re-armed the village companies in the Kastoria district. Soon after the villages in the Edessa and Florina districts were also armed and prepared for service. The militiamen from the Kastoria and Edessa districts were actively involved in the German anti-guerilla sweep operations. In June 1944 delegation of IMRO cadres met up with the German Commander in Edessa with whom they discussed the formation of the volunteer corps. This was in accordance with the agreement Ivan Mihailov and IMRO struck with Hitler and Himmler, which envisaged that these battalions would form the avant-garde of the whole Macedonian military effort in Western Macedonia and would spearhead the drives and sweeps against the ELAS forces. However, the guerrilla bands of EAM/ELAS soon forced Ohrana to retreat and disbanded many of its groups. In one report of Colonel Mirchev to the staff of the army on 5 June 1944, it was reported that the ELAS fighters took captive the local band consisting 28 militiamen. On 21 August 1944 ELAS successfully attacked the IMRO stronghold at the village of Polikerason. During the battle, 20 IMRO militiamen were reported killed in action and 300 militiamen were captured. In September, two IMRO companies were wiped out in the defense of Edessa by an ELAS attack. The dissolution of Ohrana After the declaration of war by Bulgaria on Nazi Germany in September 1944 Ivan Mihaylov arrived in German-occupied Skopje, where the Germans hoped that he could form a Macedonian puppet-state with their support. Seeing that Germany had lost the war he refused. Ohrana was dissolved in late 1944 after their German and Bulgarian protectors were forced to withdrew from Greece.Macedonia in the 1940s.Modern and Contemporary Macedonia, vol. II, 64-103. by Yiannis D. Stefanidis In autumn 1944 Anton Kalchev escaped northern Greece, and tried to flee with the retreating German army, but was captured in the vicinity of Bitola by communist partisans from Vardar Macedonia, and was apprehended to ELAS officials. In Thesaloniki, Kalchev was put on trial as military criminal and was sentenced to death by the Greek authorities. After World War II the ruling Bulgarian Communists declared the Slav-speaking population in Macedonia (including the Bulgarian part) as ethnic Macedonians. The organizations of the IMRO in Bulgaria were completely destroyed. Also the internment of those people disagreeing with these political activities was organized at the Belene labor camp. Tito and Georgi Dimitrov worked about the project to merge the two Balkan countries Bulgaria and Yugoslavia into a Balkan Federative Republic according to the projects of Balkan Communist Federation. This led to the 1947 cooperation and signing of Bled Agreement. It foresaw unification between Yugoslav (\\"Vardar\\") and Bulgarian (\\"Pirin\\") Macedonia, as well as a return of the so-called Western Outlands to Bulgaria. They also supported the Greek Communists and especially Slavic-Macedonian National Liberation Front in the Greek Civil War with the idea of unification of Greek Macedonia and Western Thrace to the new state under Communist rule. By this situation the Macedonian section of the Greek Communist Party created the SNOF and some of the former collaborators enlisted in the new unit.–ò–¥–µ–æ–ª–æ—à–∫–∏–æ—Ç –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–∏–∑–∞–º –Ω–∞–¥ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Ü–∏—Ç–µ –ø–æ–¥ –ì—Ä—Ü–∏—ò–∞, –°—Ç–æ—ò–∞–Ω –ö–æ—á–æ–≤, –°–∫–æ–ø—ò–µ, 2000 —Å—Ç—Ä.43 and took part in the Greek Civil War on the side of the Democratic Army of Greece. To an extent the collaboration of the peasants with the Germans, Italians, Bulgarians or ELAS was determined by the geopolitical position of each village. Depending upon whether their village was vulnerable to attack by the Greek communist guerrillas, or the occupation forces, the peasants would opt to support the side in relation to which they were most vulnerable. In both cases, the attempt was to promise \\"freedom\\" (autonomy or independence) to the formerly persecuted Slavic minority as a means of gaining its support.

Although the People's Republic of Bulgaria originally accepted very few refugees, government policy changed and the Bulgarian government actively sought out ethnic Macedonian refugees. It is estimated that approximately 2,500 children were sent to Bulgaria and 3,000 partisans fled there in the closing period of the war. There was a larger flow into Bulgaria of refugees as the Bulgarian Army pulled out of the Drama-Serres region in 1944. A large proportion of Slavic speakers emigrated there. The \\"Slavic Committee\\" in Sofia () helped to attract refugees that had settled in other parts of the Eastern Bloc. According to a political report in 1962 the number of political emigrants from Greece numbered at 6,529. The policy of communist Bulgaria towards the refugees from Greece was, at least initially, not discriminative with regard to their ethnic origin: Greek- and Slav-speakers were both categorized as Greek political emigrants and received equal treatment by state authorities. However, certain institutions of communist Bulgaria, charged with the national policy, tried progressively to promote certain selection among them privileging Slav-speakers, frequently named ethnic Macedonians and to prescribe special measures for the attainment of their ‚Äúethnic‚Äù loyalty. Unlike the other countries in the Eastern Bloc there were no specific organizations founded to deal with specific issues relating to the child refugees, this caused many to cooperate with the \\"Association of Refugee Children from the Aegean part of Macedonia\\", an association based in the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. However, the end of the 1950s and the beginning of the 1960s was marked by a decisive turn in the ‚ÄúMacedonistic‚Äù policy of Bulgaria, which did not recognize anymore the existence of a Macedonian ethnicity different from the Bulgarian one. As a result, the trend to a discriminative policy, the refugees from Greece ‚Äì more targeted at the Slav-speakers and less to ‚Äúethnic Greeks‚Äù ‚Äì was given a certain proselytizing aspect. In 1960, the Bulgarian Communist Party voted a special resolution explained ‚Äúwith the fact that almost all of the Macedonians have a clear Bulgarian national consciousness and consider Bulgaria their homeland. Eventually many of these migrants were assimilated into Bulgarian society.

The movement originated from B√©la Bal√°zs Studios, a small-budget filmmaking community that aimed to unite the young avant-garde and underground filmmakers of Hungary and give them an opportunity to make experimental works without state censorship. The Bal√°zs studio gave birth to two main movements in the early 1970s: an experimental, avant-garde group (led by individuals like G√°bor B√≥dy), and the documentarist group, whose main goal was the portrayal of absolute social-reality on screen. This movement was called \\"Budapest school\\" by an Italian film critic on a European film festival. Soon they adopted this name. The main founders and leaders of the group were Istv√°n D√°rday, Gy√∂rgyi Szalai, Judit Ember and P√°l Schiffer. Many young and sometimes amateur artists were invited to the group by fellow filmmakers, especially B√©la Tarr, who made his debut film at the age of 22 with financing from the B√©la Bal√°zs Studios. Films of the movement were generally (but not always) shot with amateur equipment, mostly hand-held cameras, and usually by two or more cameras at the same time. Non-professional actors, who most of the time socially resembled their characters, were cast. These films also avoided pre-written scripts, with only a basic scenario and certain plot elements pre-written, and the cast members' reactions improvised on the set. Most films were shot in a very short period of time with a very limited budget or no budget at all. Their central themes were mostly the lives of working class and poor people in urban Hungary and their struggle to have a decent existence. The main goal of the movement was to show absolute reality on screen instead of the false escapism shown by commercial and mainstream films. The Budapest school movement closely resembled cinema verit√©. The first full-length film made in this manner was Jutalomutaz√°s (\\"The Prize Trip\\") (1975) by Istv√°n D√°rday and Gy√∂rgyi Szalai. The best-known example of the movement is \\"Csal√°di t≈±zf√©szek\\" (\\"Family Nest\\") (1979) by B√©la Tarr.

Originally registered as Cross-Channel Hover Services Ltd in 1965, the company was renamed Hoverlloyd during the following year. It was initially owned by a partnership between the Swedish Lloyd and the Swedish American Line shipping companies. On 6 April 1966, Hoverlloyd commenced operations from Ramsgate Harbour to Calais Harbour, operated the SR.N6 hovercraft while awaiting the completion of the considerably larger SR.N4 ferries. In addition to competing with traditional ferries, it had a fierce rivalry with hovercraft operator Seaspeed, which also operated SR.N4s on the cross-Channel route. In 1969, in conjunction with the arrival of the first SR.N4s, Hoverlloyd re-positioned its services to run between purpose- built hoverports. The 1970s was a time of optimism and growth for Hoverlloyd. Following initial difficulties, the company's fleet achieved a very high reliability record, having consistently operated in excess of 98 percent of scheduled crossings while maintaining an unblemished safety record throughout the firm's existence. Hoverlloyd possessed excellent operational bases, a hovercraft-friendly route, a fleet capable of generating returns on investment, and good quality staff. By 1980, it operated a fleet of four SR.N4s. In 1981, in response to increasing operating costs and intensifying competition, Hoverlloyd opted to merge with its long-term rival Seaspeed to form Hoverspeed. Background and formation During the late 1950s and early 1960s, British inventor Sir Christopher Cockerell had, in cooperation with British aerospace manufacturer Saunders-Roe, developed a pioneering new form of transportation, embodied in the form of the experimental SR.N1 vehicle, which became widely known as the hovercraft.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 82. British manufacturer Saunders-Roe proceeded with work on various hovercraft designs, successfully developing multiple commercially viable vehicles in the mid-1960s. These included the SR.N4, a large cross-Channel ferry capable of seating up to 418 passengers along with 60 cars, and the SR.N5, the first commercially active hovercraft.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 238, 595. The origins of Hoverlloyd can be traced back to a decision made by Swedish Lloyd shipping company in 1964 to investigate the possibility of operating a hovercraft service, which was then a pioneering and untried concept to any business. The company soon formed a partnership with Swedish American Line, owned by Brostroms Rederi AB; both companies were keen to take the lead in what they viewed as an emerging and potentially lucrative market, having identified the heavily trafficked ferry services between the ports of Dover, UK, and Calais, France, as being ripe for disruption by the new hovercraft technology.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 478. Accordingly, the two firms jointly formed a new venture to address this market; this entity was originally named the Cross-Channel Hover Services Ltd, which was registered as a British company during 1965. The company was renamed to Hoverlloyd Ltd during the following year. Despite being largely regarded as being a single company, Hoverlloyd was in fact structured as two separate companies, one being based in France and the other in the UK.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 467. Hoverlloyd was not the only hovercraft operator that decided to move on the cross-Channel market at the time; a rival company Seaspeed, owned by British Rail, was established and launched its own competing route between Calais and Dover. The two firms would compete with one another, as well as incumbent ferry operators, for market share throughout Hoverlloyd's existence. Early operations Prior to commencing operations, the company exercised great attention in the selection of the most advantageous route, as well as the optimal sites to establish bases at. It opted to focus its attention on the Ramsgate to Calais route, having identified this as possessing the perfect set of circumstances for a successful hovercraft route. Favourable factors included shelter from prevailing weather conditions when near the Goodwin Sands, while day-to-day timings could be adjusted to take advantage of both tides and winds. Hoverlloyd commenced operations from Ramsgate Harbour to Calais Harbour on 6 April 1966. Initially, the company operated an interim fleet of SR.N6 hovercraft; services with these craft were passenger-only. Upon the launch of these services, it was publicly acknowledged that the SR.N6 was unable to compete with conventional ferries in terms of ticket price alone. Despite this, hovercraft services held a competitive advantage in that they were significantly faster than these ferries, being able to rapidly traverse the English Channel with 'flight times' reportedly as low as 22 minutes. In addition to the provision of an initial revenue stream, SR.N6 operations provided valuable operating experience, guiding future routing decisions via knowledge of dominant weather conditions and such factors. These experiences were transferable to the company's larger hovercraft, however their vast difference in size and manoeuverability somewhat dulled the value of such experiences.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 481-483. In particular, while the Goodwin Sands were historically avoided as a threat to conventional vessels, hovercraft could easily operate in their vicinity without hindrance, free of other traffic concerns.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 484-491. One of Hoverlloyd's four SR.N4 hovercraft (Sir Christopher) at the Ramsgate Pegwell Bay Hoverport in the 1970s Between 1969 and 1977, Hoverlloyd took delivery of a total of four significantly larger SR.N4 hovercraft, capable of carrying 30 vehicles and 254 passengers; the type quickly replaced the SR.N6s on the Ramsgate- Calais link. The first craft was purchased at a cost of ¬£1.2 million from the British Hovercraft Corporation.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 596. The SR.N4s were given the names Sure, Swift, Sir Christopher, and The Prince of Wales respectively. In 1969, in conjunction with the arrival of the first SR.N4s, Hoverlloyd re-positioned its services to run between purpose-built hoverports. Pegwell Bay, near Ramsgate, hosted one newly built hoverport, while a similar facility just east of Calais harbour was shared between Hoverlloyd and its rival Seaspeed. The development of suitable hoverports for the SR.N4 fleet had not come cheaply; Hoverlloyd incurred a significant cost to develop suitable infrastructure to facilitate its future operations, and thus commenced service after a relatively short prototype testing period.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 505. Early on, hovercraft operations proved to be prone to disruption and abrupt cancellations on the part of adverse weather conditions, which were unfortunately common to the Channel.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 479. However, the impact of unfavourable conditions was eased over time by various modifications and improvements to the craft, such as increasingly durable rubber 'skirts', which had sustained damage from rough seas as well as ordinary wear-and- tear.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 521-523, 529. Other initial issues, such as hydraulic unreliability and equipment failures, were also partially attributable to worker unfamiliarity with the craft.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 505. A side effect of the hovercraft's high speed was a relatively bumpy ride. Benfits of the hovercraft configuration included an unmatched turnaround time, partly enabled by the ability to disembark/embark cars at both ends of the craft, whilst simultaneously facilitating the movement of foot passengers via two main exits on the port and starboard cabins. The capabilities of its SR.N4s were significantly augemented in 1973 with the delivery of the Mk.II modifications.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 474, 531-540. Heyday of operations Hoverlloyd SR.N4 Swift on an English Channel beach, 1973 Hoverlloyd principally concentrated on the Ramsgate to Calais link throughout the life of the company. By 1979, a typical day's operation at Pegwell Bay Hoverport involved 27 daily departures, starting as early as 6:00am and ending late in the evening; that year, 1.25 million passengers travelled by Hoverlloyd services on this route.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 14. Furthermore, rival Seaspeed proved incapable of matching Hoverlloyd's record for reliability, having consistently operated in excess of 98 percent of scheduled crossings while maintaining an unblemished safety record throughout the firm's existence.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 481. Hoverlloyd held ambitions to launch scheduled services to various other destinations throughout its life. Tentative plans to operate to Ostend in Belgium were mooted but ultimately never progressed. For many years, Hoverlloyd operated a successful express coach/hovercraft/coach service from London to a number of near European cities with fares which were considerably cheaper than comparable air fares that were available at the time; the most frequent service was London - Paris, while London - Brussels had fewer departures. In 1978, these were the only two destinations; Amsterdam was added during 1979. On the UK side, the coaches were operated with Hoverlloyd liveried coaches provided by Evan Evans Ltd - at that time a subsidiary of Wallace Arnold Tours of Leeds. Coaches did not cross the channel, although the hovercraft was able to readily accommodate standard- height coaches with luggage space at the rear. Hoverlloyd examined various additional coach services; while considerable exploration of launching services reaching into the German market was performed, licensing issues allegedly proved to be complex enough to prevent further expansion.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 465-467. According to authors Robin Paine and Roger Syms, Hoverlloyd possessed excellent operational bases, a hovercraft-friendly route, a fleet capable of generating returns on investment, and good quality staff.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 474. Specifically, the company's customer- facing staff were strictly drilled and trained for their roles; stewardesses were required to maintain a high level of presentability, being compelled to wear their hair up, wear white gloves, and instructed how to apply their makeup. Presentability and enthusiasm were considered to be competitive advantages over the rival Seaspeed's services. Staff were typically displayed a high level of loyalty to the company, an outcome which has been attributed to the company's amenable management style, which positively affected industrial relations.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 467-469. Crew received extensive safety training, including weekly drills, so that they were able to readily respond to a wide range of emergency situations.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 551-553. Film footage of Hoverlloyd operations appeared in several firms, including in the 1974 spy film The Black Windmill with Michael Caine, and the in the 1980 film Hopscotch with Walter Matthau. In 1975, Hoverlloyd was reportedly operating its fleet at near-maximum capability throughout the peak season; this feat would be successfully repeated during the following year and again the year after that. According to Paine and Syms, the company had an attitude of optimism and confidence at the time as it continued to expand its operations.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 561-563. In 1976, Brostroms Rederi AB decided to purchase Swedish Lloyd's stake in Hoverlloyd, becoming the sole owner of the entire operation. Hoverlloyd would remain a wholly owned subsidiary of Brostroms Rederi AB until 1981. Passenger numbers and this climate of optimism would continue to rise alike up until 1980.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 614-617. Economics of large hovercraft operation SR.N4 Swift loading at Ramsgate Hoverport, April 1977 Each SR.N4 was powered by an arrangement of four Bristol Proteus gas turbine engines; while these engines were marinised and proved to be one of the hovercraft's more reliable systems, they were relatively fuel-hungry, consuming significant amounts of aviation- grade kerosene.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 525-527, 547. As the worldwide oil crisis of the 1970s caused fuel prices to rise sharply, the operation of the SR.N4 became increasingly uneconomic. Furthermore, the closure of the British Hovercraft Corporation restricted support options, meaning that maintenance of the craft became more costly over time, and that neither like-for-like replacements or improved successor hovercraft were likely to be developed. Indeed, Sure was taken out of service in 1983 and cannibalised for parts to keep the rest of the fleet operating. Seaspeed (and later Hoverspeed) operated a single French-built SEDAM N500 craft from 1977.Paine and Syms 2012, p. 554. However, it was beset by design and operational problems; following somewhat sporadic service, the N500 was permanently withdrawn during 1983 and later scrapped.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 609-612. Hoverlloyd sold various duty-free goods on board their SR.N4s during the cross-Channel transit. These sales comprising a meaningful portion of the service's overall revenue; thus the company strongly emphasised the importance of onboard sales amongst their staff. The abolition of duty-free sales during the late 1990s further diminished operating income and contributed to the fleet's withdrawal. Increasing staffing requirements brought on by the implementation of new legislation and actions by trade unions also contributed to the craft's increasing operating costs.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 567-570, 600. Fresh competition from high-speed rail services, facilitated by the completion of the Channel Tunnel in 1996, undermined the SR.N4's speed advantage, drawing passengers away and further decreasing the service's commercial viability. These combined factors gradually worsened the SR.N4's economics as time progressed. Merger and rationalisation By 1980, it was obvious that cross- Channel hovercraft operation could only continue economically if the two operating companies merged, with consequent rationalisation. Therefore, in 1981, Hoverlloyd and Seaspeed merged to create the combined Hoverspeed.Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 616-626. The former Hoverlloyd services from Ramsgate were subsequently withdrawn after the 1982 season and the four ex-Hoverlloyd craft were thereafter based at Dover; they were gradually withdrawn from service between 1983 and 1993 to be used for spare parts for Hoverspeed's remaining SR.N4 fleet. In 1991, it was announced that the SR.N4 service would be eventually phased out entirely in favour of catamarans. All four ex-Hoverlloyd craft were eventually broken up and none remains extant (one ex-Seaspeed SR.N4 craft remains and is stored at the Hovercraft Museum, The Princess Anne is going to be restored in its former Seaspeed livery but The Princess Margaret was broken up). For a time, the hoverport at Pegwell Bay was used as an engineering and administrative base by Hoverspeed after all passenger services had ceased, but the site was eventually closed and all of the buildings demolished. The hovercraft pad, car-marshalling area and approach road are the main identifiable features that remain at the site. Hoverspeed continued cross-Channel hovercraft operation until October 2000, when the last two SR.N4s were withdrawn and the era of ‚Äòhovering across the Channel‚Äô came to an end.

In general, interest in professionalism has been widespread in medicine probably owing to the increasing regulatory and economic pressures on the practice of medicine. Many physicians have sought to identify the focal meaning of what it is to be a doctor in an effort to revitalize the profession. Kuczewski has been among a group that includes Richard and Sylvia Creuss, John Coulehan, and Matthew Wynia who see medical professionalism as including a commitment to social justice. That is, while professionalism entails such things as etiquette, communication skills, and basic medical ethics, professions are also expected to be leaders in educating the public and in advocating for the health of the public. Such leadership requires an understanding of the factors that lead some patient populations to be underserved and a commitment to bringing about social change to ameliorate these problems. The New Professionalism movement in medicine is a revival of communitarian bioethics that focus on the kinds of people and society we wish to be rather than on particular ethical questions of right and wrong. This focus on the relationship between the professional and the community can have important implications for medical education and professional development. While not eschewing case analysis and problem solving, the emphasis on the development of the person has created a renewed interest in narrative methods and reflection. Kuczewski has been an outspoken critic of efforts in medical education to focus on quantitative measures of professionalism education. He has argued that in an effort to make professionalism education ‚Äúobjective,‚Äù many medical educators are equating professionalism with trivial but easily measured behaviors. Kuczewski‚Äôs interest in professionalism and social justice has led him to pursue ethical issues in the interactions between medicine and recent immigrant populations. He has brought his work in communitarian and casuistic methods to bear on questions such as medical repatriation, insurance for undocumented immigrants, and the eligibility of DREAMers (undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children) to become practicing physicians. His scholarship and advocacy was the catalyst for the Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine becoming the first medical school in the United States to explicitly welcome applications from DREAMers with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status. Under Kuczewski‚Äôs direction, the Neiswanger Institute for Bioethics and Health Policy at Loyola University Chicago has become a leader in educational programming to promote the relationship between medical professionalism and social justice. The Neiswanger Institute has contributed elements to the Stritch curriculum that explore the relationship between the business of medicine and social justice. The Institute also has online master of arts and doctoral programs that incorporating public health and leadership training in order to help health care professionals across the United States to promote service to the underserved. Kuczewski was elected president of the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities and served a two-year term from 2009 to 2011. The ASBH is the major professional association in the United States for individuals engaged in bioethics and medical humanities. During his term, the society aggressively began moving toward a process called Quality Attestation that will attest to the credentials and expected competence of clinical ethics consultants.

On the side, other Looney Tunes characters run into Halloween-typed situations themselves (including Daffy Duck and his nephew and their own encounters with Witch Hazel).

Featured cartoons  * A-Haunting We Will Go (1966) (Daffy Duck's nephew encounters Witch Hazel while trick or treating. Daffy does not believe his nephew and starts heading to the witch's house to prove him wrong). * Broom- Stick Bunny (1956) (Bugs, also trick or treating in the same costume as Daffy's nephew, arrives at Witch Hazel's house. The witch invites him for tea, but when Bugs reveals himself, he begins to leave. Witch Hazel asks him to stay and have the tea, but Bugs instead brags about his doctor's tea, and leaves to prove to the witch that it has \\"more pizzazz\\".) * Hyde and Hare (1955) (It turns out that the doctor Bugs spoke of is none other than Dr. Jekyll, and Bugs inevitably comes face to face with Mr. Hyde) * Hyde and Go Tweet (1960) (While Bugs encounters Dr. Jekyll, Sylvester has a dream about his encounter with a Tweety turned into a Hyde-like monster) * Hyde and Hare (part two) (Bugs comes across Dr. Jekyll's Hyde formula, believing it to be the doctor's tea. After wondering whether or not it really does have pizzazz, he drinks some of it (\\"Neh, why not? It's Halloween.\\") and returns to Witch Hazel as a monster. The witch mistakes Bugs's new form for another costume, and turns him back to normal, causing Bugs to faint.) * A Witch's Tangled Hare (1959) (After attempting to add Bugs to her stew, Witch Hazel chases him all the way to an ancient castle) * A Haunting We Will Go (part two) (Witch Hazel makes Speedy Gonzales into her exact double. She dipped cheese in her witch's brew after he asked to borrow a cup of cheese. He is not good at acting like a witch. He stands in for the witch while Daffy tries to prove his nephew wrong. Speedy makes tea that turns Daffy into the strange creature from Duck Amuck. The witch turns Speedy and Daffy back to normal.) * Claws for Alarm (1954) and Scaredy Cat (1948) (Witch Hazel converts her home into a hotel, when Bugs shows up once more, telling her that he is unimpressed with her spells. The witch decides to put a spell on Sylvester, who has to spend the night in the hotel with Porky Pig while enduring murderous mice. Eventually, Sylvester can not take it anymore and runs away from the hotel.) * Transylvania 6-5000 (1963) (Bugs, impressed with Witch Hazel, gives her the Hyde formula (which he has grown disgusted of). Upon drinking the formula, the witch transforms into a vampire and proceeds to stalk Bugs while he explores her place.) * Bewitched Bunny (1954) (Bugs unwittingly restores Witch Hazel back to her natural form, and she declares, \\"All right, rabbit, you've spelled your final spell. Now it's my turn!\\" She chases Bugs into a hallway with no escape, but Bugs finds her emergency supply of magic powder and transforms the witch into a female bunny, whom Bugs sees as a love interest (\\"Sure, I know, but after all, who wants to be alone on Halloween?\\"). In an epilogue, the two rabbits celebrate Halloween by drinking the stew from Witch Hazel's cauldron, but Bugs comments that it needs salt.)

History SNL once again dodged cancellation from season 20's low ratings and scathing reviews about the show's decline in quality. The cast was mostly overhauled. new writers were brought in, and Beth McCarthy Miller took over as director. The season was home to the Rage Against the Machine incident. On April 13, 1996, the band was the musical guest, and was scheduled to perform two songs. The show was hosted that night by ex- Republican presidential candidate and billionaire Steve Forbes. According to RATM guitarist Tom Morello, \\"RATM wanted to stand in sharp juxtaposition to a billionaire telling jokes and promoting his flat tax by making our own statement.\\"Anon., Saturday Night Live Incident, Public release and distribution. Retrieved November 12, 2007. To this end, the band hung two upside-down American flags from their amplifiers. Seconds before they took the stage to perform \\"Bulls on Parade\\", SNL and NBC sent stagehands in to pull the flags down. Following the removal of the flags during the first performance, the band was approached by SNL and NBC officials and ordered to immediately leave the building. Upon hearing this, bassist Tim Commerford reportedly stormed Forbes's dressing room, throwing shreds from one of the torn down flags. Morello noted that members of the Saturday Night Live cast and crew, whom he declined to name, \\"expressed solidarity with our actions, and a sense of shame that their show had censored the performance.\\" A new logo was used starting this season, consisting of the words SATURDAYNIGHTLIVE in a sans- serif typeface, and was used until 2006. Cast Only five cast members: Norm Macdonald (who was a stand-out in the otherwise lackluster 20th season), Mark McKinney, Tim Meadows (who was almost let go until Lorne Michaels realized that he needed an African-American person in his new cast and Ellen Cleghorne decided not to stay), Molly Shannon (who was hired as a replacement for Janeane Garofalo), and David Spade (who only stayed on the show to be the \\"bridge\\" between the remaining season 20 cast members and the up-and-coming season 21 cast) returned to the show from the previous season. Although Spade returned to the show, he had more of a diminished role, very rarely appearing in sketches except for Spade in America, a \\"Weekend Update\\" segment hosted by Spade that debuted at the start of the season and was featured in all but five episodes. With the cast overhaul taking place, Lorne Michaels hired Jim Breuer, Will Ferrell, Darrell Hammond, David Koechner, Cheri Oteri, and Nancy Walls (who, coincidentally, would later marry Steve Carell, who auditioned to be part of the season 21 cast, but never made it). Molly Shannon was upgraded to repertory status. Chris Kattan and newly hired writer Colin Quinn also joined as featured players for the final six episodes of the season. Fred Wolf was hired later in April as a featured player. This would be the final season for David Spade. Spade had agreed to stay only a year so he could be a bridge between the old and new casts. Newcomers David Koechner and Nancy Walls were also let go after this season.

In room and pillar mining, tunnels are advanced in a rectangular pattern resembling city streets (tunnels), leaving behind blocks (pillars) of coal. To a miner, a partially completed tunnel resembles a room dug into the coal seam. As mining proceeds, the weight of rock overburden previously supported by coal mined from rooms is redistributed to pillars. If that weight exceeds the strength of a pillar, the pillar can fail by crushing or exploding. An explosive failure is called a ‚Äúbump.‚Äù In the eastern United States' coalfields, bumps are more likely when the overburden is at least 500 feet (150 m); where a strong, overlying stratum, such as sandstone, occurs near the coalbed; and with a strong, inflexible floor. In the United States, the number of deaths from bumps had dropped off dramatically since the early 1990s, but fatalities are more common in the West where mines often run deeper. Bumps are three times more likely in room-and-pillar mines, and are even more common in mines that do retreat mining, in which the pillars are removed as the miners retreat towards the mine entrance with the intent of allowing an orderly collapse of the mine.Coal Mine Bumps: Five Case Studies in the Eastern United States.

The population in 1991 was 797. The focus of the village is the harbour, which is home to small fishing boats as well as large deep sea trawlers. The village is overlooked by the granite mansion Symbister House, built by the Sixth Robert Bruce of Symbister in 1823. The harbour is also known by the names Bay Of Symbister, Symbister Harbour and Symbister Old Harbour. The Pier House, now a museum, was once the centre for the export of dried and salted fish to the Hanseatic League, an alliance of trading guilds that established and maintained a trade monopoly over much of Northern Europe between the 13th and 17th centuries. History The island has been inhabited for more than 4000 years as witnessed by the Neolithic houses of Yoxie and Benie. An Iron Age block house to the northeast overlooks the Loch of Huxter. In the 14th century, the Huxters took over the island and held it until they went bankrupt in the 1830s. Germans also sailed to Symbister for trading and brought their goods, iron tools, seeds, salt and cloth to barter for dried and salted fish from the island. The old Hanseatic house which had been used by the Germans for several centuries until 1707, was refurbished into the museum. William Bruce of Symbister, who had migrated from Fife to Symbister, was a deputy to Laurence Bruce of Cultamalindie. In 1571, he was the Great Foude of Shetland, under Lord Robert Stewart. After his retirement, he moved back to his home country but he left his properties at Symbister to his eldest son and Fife to a son by his second wife. William Bruce, his grandson, the third in the lineage left his properties to a son by his second wife. The family lived in Symbister until recently and had considerable power on the island. Tobset Bruce built the Symbister House at a cost of more than ¬£30,000 pounds using granite in 1823. In the 1850s, Robert Bruce of Symbister leased part of his estate to Robert Mouatvery, a merchant who illtreated his tenants and exploited the four estates. Symbister estate's fishing tenure under his lease was still run in a primitive form even in the 1860s, as William Stewart testified before a Royal Commission in 1872. Symbister House The last resident of the Symbister House died in 1944. Since the 1960s, Symbister House has been used as Whalsay Junior High School, providing education to students of age 4-16. The land around the Symbister House has an old wooden boat sculpture. Ghost stories are also narrated about this place, including that of an old sailor who was murdered for arguing with the gardener of the house during a game of cards. Facilities and economy Symbister harbour and ferry terminal Symbister is a sheltered harbour and is busy with small fishing boats and recreational craft plying alongside large ocean-going trawlers. The marina here is a seventy-berth facility and also accommodates ferries travelling between the islands. A ferry to Laxo on the Shetland mainland operates from Symbister. Apart from ferry services, Symbister is also accessible by road from Whalsay airstrip, located in the island at its northeastern end at Skaw. As a village, Symbister has infrastructure facilities and basic amenities such as a post-office, many shops, a community hall, police station and a medical hospital with surgical facilities. Whalsay Leisure Centre, Grieve House camping B√∂d and Harbison Park, home of Whalsay Football Club, are also of note. Symbister Harbour is now a modern harbour with a large fleet of fishing craft which have contributed to the economic progress of the island and making it one of the most prosperous in the region. Whalsay Boating and Sports Club is based at the harbour. Fishing has been the mainstay of the island of Whalsay and its harbour housed the fishing community. During the earlier centuries herring was the main fishing focus with catches peaking in 1834. However, this industry suffered due to drastic decline of yield within a few years. Fishing picked up again in the late 1800s and in the mid 1900s. Aquatic fauna Sea mammals such as porpoise, dolphin, minke whale, and orca can be seen from the rocks offshore over the harbour. Many migrants birds, like wheatear, meadow pipit, snow bunting and buff breasted sandpiper have been sighted.

Jin Yong describes her appearance as \\"naturally elegant, with a bright countenance\\".Quote: ÁÄüÁÅëÈ£ÑÈÄ∏ÔºåÂÆπÂÖâÁÖß‰∫∫. cnnovels.net Role in the novel Zhao Min is the daughter of Chaghan Tem√ºr, a Mongol prince of the Yuan dynasty. Her elder brother is K√∂ke Tem√ºr. As a child, Zhao Min was ambitious and full of vigour, eager to take on duties that are traditionally done by men. Her father was appointed by the emperor to eradicate the rebel organisation Ming Cult and bring order to the wulin (martial artists' community). Zhao Min helps her father with her wit and intelligence. Zhao Min makes her first appearance in the novel by using the Ten Fragrances Tendon Weakening Powder (ÂçÅÈ¶ôËªüÁ≠ãÊï£) to poison several martial artists from the six major orthodox sects in the wulin, including the \\"Seven Heroes of Wudang\\" and Abbess Miejue of the Emei Sect. They are captured and imprisoned in Wan'an Monastery. As the six sects have recently come to a truce with the Ming Cult, Zhao Min intends to lure Zhang Wuji, the new leader of the cult, into a trap and capture him too. Zhang Wuji travels to Green Willow Mountain Manor to meet Zhao Min, without knowing her true identity. When Zhao Min attempts to poison Zhang Wuji with the powder, he sees through her plans and tries stops her. She traps him in an underground chamber, but he bring her down with him. Eventually she lets him out. Zhao Min also improves her martial arts prowess by tricking the captured martial artists into displaying their skills, lying that she will set them free if they can defeat her men, while secretly noting down their movements and learning them. Despite standing on opposing grounds with Zhang Wuji, she gradually falls in love with her rival and asks him to let her to follow him on his adventures, as part of her three conditions in freeing the captured martial artists. On Divine Serpent Island, Zhao Min is wrongly accused by Zhang of murdering Yin Li, and robbing him of the Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber. Actually, the one responsible is Zhou Zhiruo, who has stolen the secret from the weapons and framed Zhao Min for it. When Zhang Wuji encounters Zhao Min later, he wants to kill her but refrains from doing so, because he has fallen in love with her. As the story progresses, the romantic relationship between Zhang Wuji and Zhao Min deepens, even though they are entangled in a love triangle with Zhou Zhiruo. When Zhang Wuji decides to marry Zhou Zhiruo, Zhao Min appears and disrupts the wedding, stating that her second condition (when she agreed to free the captured martial artists) is that he cannot marry Zhou Zhiruo. Zhang Wuji rejects the request initially, but accepts later when Zhao Min tells him that she knows the whereabouts of his godfather, Xie Xun. Zhou Zhiruo hates Zhao Min and attacks her with the 'Nine Yin White Bone Claw' but Zhang Wuji saves Zhao Min. By the end of the novel, Zhang Wuji realises Zhao Min is his true love and he tells Zhou Zhiruo. The couple decides to retire from the jianghu for a reclusive life after Zhang mistakenly believes that his subordinates are planning to kill him to seize power. In the last chapter, Zhao Min tells Zhang Wuji that her third condition is for him to help her paint her eyebrows. Family treeNotesReferences * Tan, Xianmao (2005).

Built during the years 1930-1936. DƒÖbr√≥wka Ko≈õcielna is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Kiszkowo, within Gniezno County, Greater Poland Voivodeship, in west-central Poland. It is surrounded by forest areas, and lies in the eastern part of Puszcza Zielonka Landscape Park. The village has a neo-baroque Roman Catholic church (the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary), built in 1925 in place of the former wooden church. The church houses a picture of the Madonna and Child, to which miracles have long been attributed (the original picture was displayed on an oak tree, and was said to glow in the dark), making the village and its church a popular destination for pilgrims since the 17th century. This tradition continues today, particularly in the form of an annual fair and mass pilgrimage in September. This takes place on the weekend of the first Sunday after 8 September, which is celebrated as the birthday of the Virgin Mary. The present picture is actually the fourth copy of the original, which was destroyed when the then church burnt down as a result of lightning strike in 1774. A copy survived and continued to be venerated until the subsequent fire in 1925. A further copy (by Pozna≈Ñ artist Zientkiewicz) was consecrated in 1927. This was removed from the church by the parish priest in 1939 in an attempt to save it from the invading German forces, but it was lost during fighting near Kutno, when the house in which it was being stored was destroyed. A further copy (based on surviving prints) was made in 1949 (by Edmund Szyfter), but it was felt to be of poor artistic quality and was demoted to use in processions. The copy currently on display over the church altar was commissioned in 1955 from the Toru≈Ñ artist Professor Leonard Torwirt. On 15 June 1969 the picture was \\"crowned\\" by the addition of gold crowns on the heads of Mary and Jesus, in a ceremony presided over by the Primate of Poland and authorized by Pope Paul VI. The original crowns were stolen from the church, along with other valuable items, in 1989, but new crowns were added at a second coronation ceremony in 1994.

It was released on Region 1 DVD on January 20, 2009. Plot Struggling Hollywood film producer Charlie Berns is on the verge of suicide when his aspiring screenwriter nephew Lionel arrives from New Jersey with a script about 19th century British statesman Benjamin Disraeli. Charlie agrees to make the film, but only when he converts the literate PBS-style script (that he didn't read) into an action adventure Middle Eastern espionage film, Ben Disraeli: Freedom Fighter. He casts power- star African American Bobby Mason, a recent convert to Judaism, in the title role and, after some creative wrangling with studio big-wigs and feisty project developer Deidre Hearn, whom he is instantly attracted to, he proceeds to set up production in South Africa. Charlie then lies to the studio, saying Bobby insists Deidre, who has purposely avoided Charlie, be sent to South Africa to assist on the production. She arrives, and she and Charlie eventually 'hook-up'. After Bobby is kidnapped by terrorists during the shoot, and the film is shut down, Deidre hatches a scheme to produce Lionel's original script 'on the Q.T.'. Using financing that must stay in Prague, Charlie and Deidre manage to film Lionel's original movie there, which goes on to receive seven Golden Globe nominations, making Charlie and Deidre the newest power couple producers in Hollywood.

Macy and Meg Ryan - hardly ideal ingredients for mainstream success . . . Elliott Gould gets laughs as the credit-hungry rabbi pulled in to consult on the film, although a few A-list celebrity cameos in the movie-star roles would have gone a long way toward completing the illusion.\\"Variety review Although Matt Prigge of the Philadelphia Weekly felt there was \\"nothing remotely original\\" about the film, he thought it \\"just happens to be sprightlier than most, zipping along from one familiar but well-deployed yuk to the next and anchored by the surprisingly winning team of Macy and Meg Ryan.\\"Philadelphia Weekly review Michael Atkinson of the Boston Phoenix called the film a \\"bouncy, sharp-edged farce . . . [whose] target audience is, to some degree, its own cast and crew. Yet it‚Äôs difficult to resist when the purely idiotic is openly mocked by a sure-footed cast of line readers led by William H.

It is situated at the foot of Bredon Hill about two miles south of Evesham. At a little over three square miles, the land is largely agricultural - most of the 101 houses and 254 residents Worcs CC 2001 census are grouped in a small area between the church and what used to be the railway station. The River Isbourne valley divides Hinton into the \\"East Village\\", near to the church, and the \\"West Village\\". Most of the houses in the East Village date from the 19th century; many of the properties to the West of the Isbourne are much newer. Most of the land, and many of the properties in the East Village, are leased from a charitable trust. The building that formerly housed a village school has been converted into houses. The single shop in the village tractor sales is specialised in the sale of agricultural machinery. The main A46 from Evesham to Cheltenham passes through the parish and is crossed by the Broadway to Pershore Road (formerly The London Road) at Hinton Cross but the majority of the houses are located on a quiet loop.. The Isbourne is three or four metres wide and less than a metre deep, and occasionally floods. The most notable recent flood was in July 2007 when the small river became a torrent about a hundred metres wide and five metres deep. Two houses built on the river bank suffered serious damage, but the rest of the village is well above the flood plain and avoided the devastation that hit nearby Sedgeberrow just a mile upstream. Railways The former railway station, known simply as Hinton, belonged to the Midland Railway (later part of the LMS), and was situated on a lengthy loop line, Gloucester Loop Line branching off the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway main line at Ashchurch, passing through Evesham railway station, Alcester and Redditch, and rejoining the main line at Barnt Green, near Bromsgrove. The loop was built to address the fact that the main line bypassed most of the towns it might otherwise have served, but it took three separate companies to complete. The loop officially closed between Ashchurch and Redditch in June 1963, but poor condition of the track had brought about withdrawal of all trains between Evesham and Redditch earlier, in October 1962, being replaced by a bus service for the final eight months. Redditch to Barnt Green remains open on the electrified Birmingham suburban network. Hinton station house still stands. Local news Hinton Community Group organizes an Annual fete.

Description Aloe Marlothii in flower, showing the uniquely horizontal racemes of the inflorescence. Like many Aloe species, Aloe marlothii is more spiny when it is small and vulnerable to grazing. Named after Rudolf Marloth, a South African botanist, this species of aloe has an especially large robust head of stiff, grey-green leaves. These leaves can be up to 1.5m in length and usually densely covered in short spines on the convex lower surfaces and less so on the concave upper surfaces. Like many other arborescent aloe species, this Aloe is more spiny when it is small and as it becomes taller and less vulnerable to grazing, it loses many of the spines from its leaf surfaces. It normally has a trunk densely covered by the withered old leaves. The inflorescence is a much- branched panicle with up to 30 or exceptionally 50 racemes. Flower colour varies a great deal, and ranges from yellow through orange (most common) to bright red. Flowering takes place through the winter months, as is the case with most aloes. The distinctively horizontal branches of its inflorescence is an easy way to distinguish this species from other aloes. For this reason it is sometimes known as the flat-flowered aloe. (However, the type known as Aloe spectabilis, has taller, less horizontal inforescences.) The densely packed flowers all tend to point upwards from the raceme. When not in flower, it is easily confused with the closely related Zimbabwe Aloe, and with the similar- looking Cape Aloe and African Aloe species to the south. Distribution Its distribution ranges from the Klip River Hills in Johannesburg, through eastern Botswana, northwards over the Soutpansberg to Zimbabwe and Malawi and eastwards through Swaziland and Mozambique to the coast. Within this range, it is especially common in mountainous areas, which led it to be known as the mountain aloe. This species grades through intermediate forms into Aloe spectabilis Reynolds of KwaZulu-Natal, and the two are now considered synonymous. Aloe marlothii forms natural hybrids with some 30 or more species.

The site is located immediately behind the Cann Wood parking at the modern road from Plympton to Shaugh Prior. Since 2016, the site is closed to visitors, however. The reasons given are the erosion of the earthwork due to visitors walking on it, and conflicts between dogs not kept on lead and grazing sheep (the latter being essential for the conservation of the site). The fort is constructed around an earlier ring ditch, and covers an area of around . The remains consist of a sub-circular enclosure surrounded by an rampart and a similarly sized outer ditch. This ditch can still be seen in places, though tree planting has covered some of the defences around the main entrance. To the east of the fort is a banked path, the remains of a medieval road from Plympton to Shaugh Prior. The road was abandoned in the early 19th century.

This is important because these people have frequently been restricted from moving, which can contribute to significant complications if they are in intensive care, including skin ulcers, pressure sores, pneumonia, blood clots and other complications. In fact, moving people (like sitting them on the edge of the bed, allowing them to stand and also to move their hip) might even make the dialysis last longer, which could be more effective.Wang Y, Haines T, Ritchie P, Walker C, Ansell T, Ryan DT, Lim PS, Vij S, Acs R, Fealy N, Skinner EH.

The bridge carries/connects SC 49 and NC 49, which is utilized by mostly local traffic. A sidewalk, along the east facing side of the bridge, provides pedestrian access. History=Buster Boyd Bridge I William Monroe \\"Buster\\" Boyd, was an influential Mecklenburg County politician from Steele Creek. Boyd lobbied Mecklenburg County Commissioners for a hard-surfaced road to be built from Charlotte to what was then known as Lake Catawba. After the road was built, Boyd fought heavily for the construction of a bridge that would span Lake Catawba, connecting Mecklenburg County with York County on the South Carolina side. During its construction the bridge was referred to as York-Mecklenburg Bridge but upon completion was named in honor of Boyd, who donated the access land on the North Carolina side. The original Buster Boyd Bridge was built at a cost of $120,000, with Mecklenburg County paying two-thirds of the cost and York County, South Carolina paying the remaining one-third. Mecklenburg County raised their portion of the funds by selling $75,000 in bonds The bridge spanned 1,378 feet across in 10 spans. It officially opened to automobile traffic on January 9, 1923. The bridge featured an excessively high lake clearance due to known plans by Catawba Power Company to build a larger dam, which would make Lake Catawba much larger and deeper in the following year. A biplane flies beneath the original Buster Boyd Bridge on August 17, 1923.A great celebration of the new Buster Boyd Bridge was held on August 17, 1923. Both North Carolina Governor Cameron A. Morrison and South Carolina Governor Thomas Gordon McLeod were among the estimated crowd of 12,000 attending the event. Ceremonies commenced with several acrobatic biplanes flying aerial maneuvers beneath the center span of the bridge. In 1960 the name of the body of water over which the Buster Boyd Bridge spans was changed from Lake Catawba to Lake Wylie in honor of Dr. Walker Gill Wylie, one of the founders of what was to become Duke Energy Company. Just one month before a new bridge was to replace the original bridge, it was closed to traffic in September 1961 after a truck struck it, causing serious structural damage. Buster Boyd Bridge II The second Buster Boyd Bridge opened in October 1961 at a cost of $700,000. The structure was demolished in July 2001, two weeks after the third bridge first began carrying traffic. Buster Boyd Bridge III Construction on the third and current Buster Boyd Bridge began in April 1999, as a joint- partnership between the North Carolina Department of Transportation and the South Carolina Department of Transportation. The new bridge first opened to automobile traffic with only two lanes on June 16, 2001, with all four-lanes finally being officially completed on September 16, 2003 (two years behind schedule). The final cost of the bridge was over $12 million. In addition to replacing the 40-year-old 2nd Buster Boyd Bridge and finally expanding automobile traffic to four lanes, the newest Buster Boyd Bridge also provides a lake clearance five feet higher than before to allow for more boat traffic beneath the center span. The current structure also provides a separated pedestrian walkway on each side for the first time. Trivia The Buster Boyd Bridge is the only bridge in which North Carolina is on the southern end and South Carolina is on the northern end.

Description The source of the river lies north of the Christmas Mountains, in the rugged terrain between Mount Carleton, and Big Bald Mountain. Several falls are present along the river's course, including Indian Falls (near Popple Depot), Nepisiguit Falls and Pabineau Falls. Along this river lies a vast forest, where many individuals from New Brunswick set up camps. Lodges are set up along the river including Governors Lodge, Rogers Lake Lodge and many others. These lodges play host to the many individuals taking part in several different outdoor activities including hunting, fishing and snowmobiling along the river. The Nepisiguit River is known for its fishing. Fishing along the Nepisiguit consists of Atlantic Salmon fishing as well as other fishing types including trout. Hunting is also another activity that takes part along the Nepisiguit because the significant animal population and various species within this region afford it. Some of the animals hunted along the Nepisiguit River include moose, deer, ruffed grouse and spruce grouse The Nepisiguit River and surrounding area also have some of the best snowmobiling trails. During the winter months, individuals from around New Brunswick as well as other parts of Canada come to the Nepisiguit region to take part and join in the snowmobiling community. The river is followed for much of its length by the Nepisiguit Mi'gmaq Trail, a hiking and backpacking trail that opened in 2018, retracing an ancient trail and portage route along the river. History William Francis Ganong remarked that, in his day, the Nepisiguit was the most remarkable river for fishing and hunting.

Alfred Apaka was arguably the foremost interpreter of Hapa haole music, which melded Hawaiian music with traditional pop music arrangements and English lyrics to convey Polynesian imagery and themes. Biography Alfred Apaka was born in Honolulu, Hawaii to vocalist Alfred Aholo Apaka, Sr. He was of Chinese, Portuguese, and Hawaiian ancestry. He was a great-grandson of Luther Aholo and grandnephew of Lydia Ka ªonohiponiponiokalani Aholo. Alfred was a graduate of President Theodore Roosevelt High School where he was an athlete and ROTC cadet captain. The family lived for a short time on Molokai but returned to Oahu. A 1938 Royal Hawaiian Hotel engagement with Don McDiarmid was Apaka's first professional performance, followed by an engagement with Ray Kinney, and a tour of the mainland. Apaka's band played up and down the Pacific coast of the United States 1946-1949. In 1951, Apaka became established at the Moana Hotel in Waikiki. Joe Glaser, Louis Armstrong's manager, and Jay Faggen signed on as his talent agents and Apaka was groomed to become a mainstream crooner competing with the likes of Bing Crosby. He joined Crosby's label, Decca Records, in 1950. Bob Hope first saw Apaka performing at a luau at Don the Beachcomber's in Waikiki in 1952. Apaka performed on many Hope and Crosby radio and television broadcasts as well as two appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1957. One month prior to his death, Apaka paid a visit to NBC in Los Angeles for a guest spot on The Dinah Shore Chevy Show on December 6, 1959. When Kaiser built his Hawaiian Village, he specifically created its Tapa Showroom exclusively for Alfred Apaka. It was a running gag that Kaiser so loved Apaka as his own son that he planned to buy the island of Molokai and rename it \\"Apaka Island.\\" Kaiser established Hawaiian Village Records, supposedly to record many local talents, but initially only naming the first Christmas release of an Apaka package. Apaka was a regular on the enormously popular syndicated radio program Hawaii Calls, produced by Webley Edwards. The radio program was heard around the world and helped to propel Apaka's career worldwide. The Decca Records release \\"The Best of Alfred Apaka\\" noted the following information in the album's liner notes: > \\"Alfred Aloha Apaka (1919-1960) was one of the influential performers in the > history of Hawaii's popular music.

In his book, Hawaiian > Music and Musicians, George Kanahele wrote that Apaka was \\"the possessor of > one of the most remarkable voices to come out of Hawaii.

The fifteenth named storm, ninth and final hurricane of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season, Olga formed as a subtropical cyclone on November 24. After acquiring tropical characteristics later that day, Olga meandered westward, and eventually reached hurricane status on November 26. Olga peaked as a 90 mph (150 km/h) Category 1 hurricane before the storm turned southwestward and weakening back into a tropical storm. On November 30 it deteriorated further to a tropical depression, although it re-intensified two days later to tropical storm intensity. Olga then dissipated as a tropical cyclone on December 4 east of the Bahamas. Its damaging effects were limited to ships at sea. The cyclone's remnants produced heavy rainfall across the Bahamas and Florida. It was a relatively rare storm to exist in December, which is outside of the normal Atlantic hurricane season. Meteorological history The origins of Hurricane Olga were from the interaction of a cold front and a small weather disturbance in the north Atlantic Ocean, producing an extratropical low east of Bermuda on November 22\\\\. The low gradually intensified and acquired subtropical characteristics, developing an area of convection east of the center and accompanied by a large area of gale-force winds. By 0000 UTC on November 24, the system organized enough to be classified as Subtropical Storm Two, while located about 900 mi (1450 km) east-southeast of Bermuda. Subsequently, the convection markedly increased and became more concentrated, with hints of an eye feature. Within 12 hours of becoming a subtropical, it is estimated the cyclone transitioned into Tropical Storm Olga; however, it was not purely tropical, due to being positioned beneath an upper-level low. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not initiate advisories until nine hours later, referring to it as Subtropical Storm Two for two more days. When advisories first began on Olga, forecasters were uncertain how long the storm would persist, due to the storm's presence within a much larger storm; one hurricane model anticipated an increase in wind shear within 24 hours, which would likely cause quick dissipation. However, the NHC accurately forecasted the storm to remain a cyclone for several days. Olga initially tracked northeastward, followed by a turn to the west due to a building ridge to its north. On November 25, the storm began acquiring more characteristics of a tropical storm, such as detaching from the larger storm and developing more distinct convective rainbands. This was due to decreasing wind shear and continued atmospheric instability, although only marginally warm sea surface temperatures. After turning to the southwest, Olga resumed a northwest motion, and at 1200 UTC on November 26, Olga intensified into a hurricane. By that time, an eye had developed in the center, and the previously large wind field had contracted. Upon attaining hurricane status, Olga was tracking northwestward due to an approaching trough. The eye steadily became better defined as outflow increased, and on November 27, Olga attained peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h), along with a minimum pressure of 973 mbar (28.73 inHg). While at peak intensity, the hurricane executed a double loop about 455 mi (730 km) east of Bermuda, due to interaction with a larger cyclonic circulation that was isolated from the westerlies. Olga shortly after transitioning into a tropical storm on November 24 On November 28, after finishing the second loop, Olga turned to the southwest due to a building ridge to its northwest. Around the same time, it began a steady weakening trend, due to strong wind shear displacing the convection. The eye became poorly defined as the center became exposed, and on November 29 Olga weakened to tropical storm status. With the thunderstorms rapidly diminishing, the storm weakened quickly, and Olga deteriorated further to a tropical depression on November 30. Forecasters anticipated continued weakening until dissipation, although the cyclone was expected to move over an area of more favorable conditions, including warmer waters and lighter shear. Still existing as a tropical cyclone on December 1, Olga extended the hurricane season beyond its typical boundaries. It continued producing a small area of deep convection, prompting one forecaster to note that \\"Olga is stubbornly holding on to tropical cyclone status... for now.\\" After reaching a position about 240 mi (385 km) northeast of the Turks and Caicos Islands, the depression turned toward the north after a trough created a weakness in the ridge. After a decrease in wind shear, deep convection redeveloped over the center, and Olga re-intensified into a tropical storm on December 2. After becoming a tropical storm again, the thunderstorms organized into a rainband about 100 mi (160 km) away from the center, characteristics more typical of a subtropical cyclone. By late on December 2, the structure resembled that of a hurricane with an eye in the center, and although convection was weak, Olga was able to intensify further to winds of . At the time, there was uncertainty whether the storm would strengthen further, possibly to near hurricane status, or rapidly weaken. Ultimately, an approaching trough caused weakening by increasing wind shear, while also forcing the storm eastward. On December 4, Olga again weakened to a tropical depression as it lost most of its convection. Later that day, the circulation turned to the southeast as a ridge built to its north, and Olga degenerated into a remnant low pressure area, about east of Nassau, Bahamas. The remnant circulation turned to the south and west, completing a loop and later moving through the Bahamas before dissipating along the north coast of Cuba on December 7. Preparations and impact Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center began issuing advisories on Olga on November 24 anticipating that the storm would threaten shipping lanes in the Atlantic. Several ships and boats in the path of Olga reported seas of or higher. One boat, the Manana Tres, reported a barometric pressure of and sustained structural damage. In Bermuda, the Bermuda Weather Service issued gale warnings and local marine warnings for boats and other small water craft. The approach of Olga also forced cancellation of the World Yacht regatta, but there was little damage on the island.

It was founded in 1956 with the mission of providing fifteen rising seniors with the traditional senior society experience in a freer, more modern setting. Mace and Chain's tomb, a centuries-old colonial structure owned by the society, boasts various military artifacts, Revolutionary War documents, and a purposefully open appearance. As is tradition for Yale secret societies, the tomb is accessible only to current members and alumni. Benedict Arnold's New Haven home, where the Mace and Chain society now resides. History The society was founded by Thornton Marshall with the help of poet and Yale professor Robert Penn Warren in 1956 (four years after Manuscript), together compiling what students refer to as the \\"Ancient Eight\\" societies on campus. Warren had encouraged Marshall \\"to start something which is a little closer to reality and that can exist in the sunlight,\\" in contrast with other senior societies. Its regular meeting place (called a \\"tomb\\"‚Äîa 190-year-old, six bedroom Colonial-style house in downtown New Haven)The youngest secret society Schacter, Ron, Yale Alumni Magazine July/Aug 2007. Accessed 2008-05-10. was salvaged from Benedict Arnold's home in New Haven and is a New Haven Historical Landmark. The society's alumni trust, the Night's Trust Foundation, owns and operates the tomb. Robert Penn Warren, a 1927 Yale graduate and Pulitzer Prize winner, helped found Mace and Chain. Mission Like other societies at Yale, Mace and Chain conducts meetings on Thursday and Sunday evenings. Among other activities and traditions, each member takes one evening to relay their life story and personal development to the rest of the group. The name Mace and Chain is rooted in discussions amongst the founders about chivalry. The society has a tradition of rotating student leadership each week and is unique among Yale's societies in allowing each new \\"delegation\\" (new senior class) to determine its own ground rules, excluding a few secret guidelines. This has helped Mace and Chain develop a reputation for fostering unusually close-knit senior classes, as members together build their society experience. Mace and Chain alumni have gone on to become journalists, authors, academics, filmmakers and members of Congress. The society hosts Yale professors and outside guests during its weekly dinners. Past faculty advisors to Mace and Chain include Charlie Hill, a former senior advisor to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, and John Wilkinson, a former vice president of Yale. Members Each year, the society admits a new tap class of fifteen rising seniors. Tap classes have historically included top-tier athletes and student leaders such as editors of the Yale Daily News and Yale Herald, Yale College Council officers, and various campus political activists. A valued criteria of all taps is adherence to the enduring values of chivalry, on which Mace and Chain was founded. That is, a reputation for respecting all members of the Yale community, demonstrating a strong moral compass and valuing ideas and others above oneself.

Upper Danube Nature Park The Upper Danube Nature Park (German: Naturpark Obere Donau), founded in 1980, is located in the south of Baden-W√ºrttemberg in Germany and encloses primarily the districts of Tuttlingen and Sigmaringen. It encompassed initially 860 km2 that were increased by about 500 km2 in 2005. The headquarters of the nature reserve association is at Beuron. The highest proportion of the nature park is taken up by the Heuberg, the south-western plateau of the Swabian Alb, and is punctuated by the Danube. Geography Two small rivers, the Brigach and the Breg at the eastern border of the Black Forest unite at Donaueschingen to form the Danube. The Danube passes through the Upper Danube Nature Park between Immendingen and Ertingen, its deep bed dug deep into the Jurassic stone of the Swabian Alb. In this break-through valley of the still narrow river mighty rocks like chalk rocks (\\"Kalkfelsen\\") are exposed: One of it is the \\"Knopfmacherfelsen\\" at Beuron. Beuron with its Beuron Archabby lies in the middle of the attractive scenery of the nature reserve. This break-through valley in the area of the Upper Danube is known as Danube Valley. The upper part of the Danube passes through following cities: Tuttlingen, M√ºhlheim, Fridingen, Sigmaringen, Scheer and Mengen. Geologically and touristically interesting are also the seepages of the Danube (\\"Donauversickerungen\\") in Immendingen and to the south of Fridingen. Quite a number of forts and castles are sitting on top of numerous rocks on this stretch above the Danube. These are: Schloss Bronnen, Altwildenstein, Unterwildenstein, Wildensteiner Burg Hexenturm, Wildensteiner Burg Hahnenkamm, Burg Wildenstein, Schloss Werenwag, Schloss Gutenstein (Gutenstein), Ruine Dietfurt, Gebrochen Gutenstein, Hohenzollernschloss Sigmaringen, Schloss Bartelstein and Schloss Scheer. In parallel with the Danube runs the Danube cycle track which leads from Donaueschingen to Vienna. The Danube valley railroad from Donaueschingen to Ulm enables the visit of the nature reserve by train. Beside regular trains, the so-called nature reserve express train operates during summer months, especially for visitors of the nature reserve between Tuttlingen and Sigmaringen. Tributaries to the Danube within the nature reserve are: from the south the Ablach and the Ostrach, and from the north the B√§ra, the Schmeie (or Schmiecha) and the Lauchert.

Novye prikluchenya Neulovimykh) is a 1968 Soviet action movie, a sequel of The Elusive Avengers, directed by Edmond Keosayan and made on Mosfilm. The movie was followed by The Crown of the Russian Empire, or Once Again the Elusive Avengers released in 1971. Plot The movie continues the story of the Elusive Avengers, a posse of young Red Partisans, including Valerka, a former schoolboy, Yashka, a devil-may-care gypsy, and two orphan siblings, Danka and his sister Ksanka. They join the Red Army and fight Baron Wrangel's White Guards. They intercept an airplane that was carrying a letter to the Baron. The letter reveals that the map of fortifications in Crimea is in possession of the White counter- intelligence officer, Colonel Kudasov. This map is vital for the Red Army assault, and the Avengers are sent on a secret mission to steal the map. They enter Sevastopol on a fishing boat and disguise themselves. Danka assumes the guise of a shoe cleaner, and Valerka fashions himself as a young monarchist nobleman. Meanwhile, the Red agent they were sent to is arrested by Kudasov and killed when he tries to escape, leaving the Avengers on their own. Ksanka meets Bubba Castorsky, a popular singer and dancer who helped the Avengers in the first movie, and Bubba tells them about a White officer who probably knows the combination for Kudasov's safe. Valerka visits the cabaret often visited by this officer, stabs Captain Ovechkin, and befriends him. But Danka is arrested, because Ataman Burnash comes to the city and recognizes him. Yashka meets the local Gypsies and persuades them to help freeing Danka. Then Captain Ovechkin recognizes Valerka for what he is, gloats at him and tells him the combination, intending to arrest him immediately, but Valerka detonates a pool ball filled with explosives and escapes. He dashes to the Counterintelligence Service headquarters, infiltrates it and steals the map. The headquarters is surrounded by soldiers, but Danka, Yashka and Ksanka distract the soldiers and let him escape with the map. The Avengers, along with Bubba, flee the city, but a White officer shoots Bubba when they are already escaping on a boat.

Casey Edwin Barker Reas (born 1972), also known as C. E. B. Reas or Casey Reas, is an American artist whose conceptual, procedural and minimal artworks explore ideas through the contemporary lens of software. Reas is perhaps best known for having created, with Ben Fry, the Processing programming language. Education and early work Reas was born Casey Edwin Barker Reas in 1972 in Troy, Ohio. He studied design at the University of Cincinnati and then spent the next two years developing software and electronics as an artistic exploration.https://adage.com/article/feature/digital-talent-ben-fry-casey- reas/125765/ While studying design in Cincinnati, Reas was a member of a band called 'nancy' with Scott Devendorf and Matt Berninger, who went on to become members of The National. Reas went on to direct four music videos for the band's 2017 album, Sleep Well Beast. In 2001, Reas earned a Master of Science in Media Arts and Sciences as a part of the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's MIT Media Lab. Art career After graduating, Reas began to exhibit his software and installations internationally in galleries and festivals. Reas's software generated images derive from short software-based instructions that visual create processes. The instructions are expressed in different media including natural language, machine code, and computer simulations, resulting in both dynamic and static images. Each translation reveals a different perspective on the process and combines with the others to produce continually evolving visual traces. Since 2012, Reas has incorporated broadcast images into his work, algorithmically distorting them to create abstractions that retain traces of their original, representational function. In 2003, Reas moved to Los Angeles where he is currently a Professor in the Department of Design Media Arts at the University of California, Los Angeles. Processing In 2001, together with MIT PhD candidate Ben Fry, Reas created the Processing programming language. Processing is widely used by thousands of artists and designers worldwide, and by educators teaching the fundamentals of programing in art and design schools.http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/top_right/2011/08/ben_fry_information_designer.html Exhibitions He has shown his work at: * the Whitney Museum of American Art's artport,http://artport.whitney.org/commissions/softwarestructures/ Software Structures * Ars Electronica in Austria,https://ars.electronica.art/export/en/digital-senses/ * ZKM in Germany, * Transmediale in Berlin, *GAFFTA in San Francisco, *Uijeongbu International Digital Art Festival in Korea, *the Danish Film Institute, *bitforms gallery in New York and Seoul, *IAMAS and ICC in Japan, *the Microwave International Media Art Festival in Hong Kong, and *the Sonar Festival in Barcelona.

They were considered the first direct negotiations in seven years between the two parties. Also present at the negotiations were the neighboring countries of Algeria and Mauritania. The negotiations were a result of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1754 of April 30, 2007 which urged both parties to \\"enter into direct negotiations without preconditions and in good faith.\\" The resolution also stipulated the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) mission extension until October 31, 2007. The first round of talks took place on June 18‚Äì19, 2007Report of the Secretary General on the status of the negotiations on Western Sahara, 29 June 2007 during which both parties agreed to resume talks on August 10‚Äì11. The second round ended with no breakthroughs, but parties agreed again to meet for another round. During the last round which took place between January 8 and 9, 2008, parties agreed on \\"the need to move into a more intensive and substantive phase of negotiations\\". A fourth round of talks was held from 18 March to 19 March 2008.afrol News - W. Sahara talks continues The negotiations were being supervised by Peter van Walsum, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's personal envoy for Western Sahara. Background The Manhasset rounds can be considered as the third attempt to reach a peaceful solution for the Western Sahara conflict. In 1991, a cease-fire agreement was concluded, which planned for a self-determination referendum (between integration to Morocco and independence as the SADR) in 1992. Because of disagreements over who should be allowed to vote, the referendum was repeatedly postponed. Morocco had brought large numbers of illegal settlers into the territory to outweigh the indigenous vote. Polisario insisted on the 1991 agreement's use of a Spanish census, taken immediately before the Moroccan occupation in 1975, as the basis of voter registration. Morocco, for its part, argued that these people were in fact Sahrawis, and that no vote could take place without them. In 1997, after US-backed mediation, Morocco and the Polisario Front went through what is known as the Houston Agreement which restarted the referendum process. The UN's MINURSO mission, tasked with keeping the peace and organizing the vote on independence, concluded its pre-referendum voter registration in 1999, with a preliminary list of approximately 85,000 voters.MINURSO Morocco protested the exclusion of large numbers of people it had claimed were of Western Saharan descent, who had been refused voting rights after interviews by MINURSO on- site inspection teams, and subsequently refused to accept the survey. When the kingdom launched some 130,000 individual appeals, UN officials admitted that the process had again entered a deadlock.For an extensive review of the voter registration process, especially its early stages, by a top UN responsible at the time, see Erik Jensen, Western Sahara. Anatomy of a Stalemate (Lynne Rienner, December 2004) Starting in 2000, there were new attempts to salvage the peace process, like the Baker Plan (Plans I and II); again with forceful US backing. These documents both involved full voting rights for all persons resident in the territory, including those Polisario had referred to as \\"settlers\\", irrespective of what MINURSO's voter identification commission had arrived at. The first Baker plan was circulated as a draft, and energetically supported by Morocco, but after Polisario voiced equally strong opposition, it was discarded by the Security Council. In contrast, the latter, more detailed version was sponsored by a UN Security Council resolution (SCR 1495) in the summer of 2003, and thereafter cautiously accepted by Polisario, allegedly after strong Algerian pressure.Toby Shelley, Behind the Baker Plan for Western Sahara (MERIP, August 1, 2003) However, it was categorically refused by Morocco on the grounds that it included independence as a ballot option; after the arrival of Mohammed VI of Morocco to the throne, in 1999, Morocco had reneged on its 1991 and 1997 agreements on a vote on independence. Polisario argued that Morocco had thus broken a main condition of the 1991 cease-fire agreement, which had wholly hinged on the independence referendum, but despite this, it did not resume fighting. Another deadlock ensued, during which Morocco made it known that it was readying a proposal for autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. Polisario agreed to enter autonomy as a third option on the referendum ballot, but refused to discuss any referendum that did not allow for the possibility of independence, arguing that such a referendum could not constitute self-determination in the legal sense of the term. Delegations=Morocco The only member of the Moroccan delegation absent at Manhasset II-IV was Fouad Ali El Himma, the former Delegate Minister to the Interior.

However, his major title of the season only came in August, where he won the Volta a Portugal. After a fabulous breakaway in one of the queen stages, and be nefiting from the passivity of the peloton (that were known to underrate the unknown Russian), he captured the yellow jersey and kept it until the end. Efimkin on a climb In 2006, he joined , but was used more as a domestique. His main achievement was a second place in the 10th stage of the Giro d'Italia and a 3rd place in the overall classification of the Vuelta a La Rioja. Efimkin finally exploded in a major competition in 2007. After finishing 6th place in the Tour de Suisse, he made a great Vuelta a Espa√±a, winning in the summit finish of the Lagos de Covadonga. He wore the golden jersey for some days and was able to finish in the 6th position of the overall. In 2008, Efimkin joined the French team, where he was one of the leaders for the Tour de France. It is possible he will be awarded a stage win from the 2008 Tour, having finished second to Riccardo Ricc√≤ during stage 9, with Ricc√≤'s subsequent positive doping test potentially disqualifying him of the victory.

Mission Until its inactivation in April 2006, the 20th Operational Weather Squadron was responsible for producing and disseminating mission planning and execution weather analyses, forecasts, and briefings for Air Force, Army, Navy, Marines, Guard, Reserve, USFK, PACOM, PACAF, USAPRAC, SOCPAC, and NAVPAC forces operating at 115 installations/sites over 5.2 million sq.mi. within the Pacific theater of operations. This weather squadron was responsible for base or post forecasting, developing weather products, briefing transient aircrews, and weather warnings for all of their geographical units. Using automatic observing systems located at all military installations and communicating with their combat weather flights, the squadron was able to 'watch' the weather in their entire area of responsibility from one central location. The Operational Weather Squadron was the first place a newly schooled weather apprentice would report. At the squadron, working alongside a seasoned weather professional, the forecaster was trained in all aspects of Air Force meteorology, from pilot briefing to tactical forecasting. The weather squadron worked closely with the combat weather flights they support to ensure a flawless exchange of weather information.

History The 20th Weather Squadron activated at Cairo, Egypt, on April 15, 1943, and was assigned to the Ninth Air Force, but was soon thereafter disbanded on October 31, 1943. The Army Air Forces again activated the 20th on December 6, 1944, on Biak Island in what was then known as the Netherlands East Indies, today's Indonesia. The 20th absorbed the resources and mission of the 5231st Weather Squadron (Provisional). The 20th was assigned to the Far East Air Forces Weather Group (Provisional) at that time. In May 1945 the squadron moved its headquarters by from Biak Island to Fort William McKinley near Manila, Philippines. By the close of July 1945, the squadron had grown to more than 700 men and the headquarters was overseeing the work of 34 weather stations, many of which were in isolated locations. The Army Air Forces Weather Service assumed control of all weather organizations on July 1, 1945, and organized the 20th under the 1st Weather Group on September 20, 1945. Due to congested quarters at Fort William McKinley, the 20th's headquarters moved again in August 1945 to nearby Nichols Field. While headquartered in the Philippines, the 20th lost two men to combat action. Following the capitulation of Japan, the 20th began its long association with Japan. The squadron moved its headquarters to Tokyo on November 2, 1945, and accompanied Headquarters, Fifth Air Force to Nagoya on May 22, 1946. War demobilization caused the 20th to lose personnel rapidly. To accomplish its growing mission, the 20th hired local nationals, employed non-weather officers to oversee some weather stations, and began on the-job schools to cross-train enlisted men into weather career fields. By late 1946, the 20th was operating weather stations in Japan, China, and Korea. The 20th relinquished control of the China stations in 1947 and the last Korean station was closed in 1949. The squadron came under the leadership of the 2143d Air Weather Wing in 1949. Within three days of North Korean troops crossing into South Korea in June 1950, a detachment of the 20th Weather Squadron was airlifted to Daegu, Korea. The leadership of the 20th Weather Squadron was soon burdened by the growth of detachments both in Korea and Japan to support the war effort. By early November 1950, the 20th was overseeing 27 detachments, eight of which were in Korea, where, on average, one of these detachments relocated every five days. The Air Force activated the 30th Weather Squadron to oversee Korean operations, but the 20th remained deeply involved in the war effort. The 20th was assigned to the newly activated 1st Weather Wing in 1954. The squadron was inactivated on February 18, 1957, but emerged anew at Fuchu Air Station, Japan, on June 8, 1964, where it remained until 1974 when it relocated to Yokota Air Base. Again, it was inactivated in 1976 as part of an Air Weather Service reorganization only to return at Yokota on January 1, 1985. As part of the divestiture of Air Weather Service, the 20th was assigned to Pacific Air Forces in 1991. It relocated to Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, on April 1, 1992, and was inactivated on June 1. With the reengineering of the Air Force Weather Agency the 20th was redesignated an Operational Weather Squadron on July 13, 2000, and activated on October 1. It was assigned to Fifth Air Force and stationed again at Yokota Air Base, Japan. Recent history The 20th Operational Weather Squadron became inactive on April 17, 2006 when its mission was transferred to the 17th Operational Weather Squadron at Hickam Field, Hawaii.

Since 1998, ITtoolbox has helped professionals make IT decisions and stay current in the rapidly changing technology market through peer collaboration. In 2007, ITtoolbox was acquired by Corporate Executive Board for $59 million. In 2012, ITtoolbox, which had since been renamed Toolbox.com, was acquired by Ziff Davis for an undisclosed amount. History The company was founded in 1998 as \\"ITtoolbox,\\" one of the first online communities enabling professionals to share knowledge about information technology. About the inception of ITtoolbox, co-founder Dan Morrison was quoted saying the concept occurred to him while working for a large project management firm that boasted an internal knowledge-sharing database: : \\"The idea hit me immediately...It seemed very logical to allow people to access the collective knowledge of the entire workforce so that they could be better at their jobs. I thought to myself, 'Imagine if this could be deployed on the Internet'.‚Äù ITtoolbox was built on five knowledge bases - SAP, Oracle, PeopleSoft, Baan, and ERP - powered by discussion forums. The ITtoolbox platform now incorporates a professional network, 28 knowledge bases, more than 200 blogs, 650 discussion groups, and a wiki to facilitate targeted community interaction in which IT advertisers can participate through a proprietary contextual matching system. In February 2000, ITtoolbox launched ITtoolbox Groups, e-mail-based discussion communities covering a range of IT products and topics. Regarding the launch, Morrison explained that at the time ‚Äúmany people (had) not yet realized the significant benefits the collaborative nature of the Internet‚Äù could bring to professionals, and that by integrating the ITtoolbox offering with email, an ordinary part of every professional's toolset, more would be exposed to these benefits. In May 2003, ITtoolbox introduced the ITtoolbox Blogs program, bringing together a network of blog authors to publish professional content based on their firsthand knowledge. In July 2005, ITtoolbox unveiled ITtoolbox Wiki, offering a collaborative IT reference guide created and edited by the community. In September 2006, ITtoolbox launched ITtoolbox Professional Networking, allowing users to create home pages representing them, find and connect with similar experts, and share IT knowledge. In January 2007, information industry analyst EPS/Outsell named ITtoolbox, YouTube, Facebook, and Zillow among 20 companies to shake up the information and publishing industries. In February 2007, Morrison, along with Reid Hoffman, CEO of LinkedIn, Jim Fowler, CEO of Jigsaw, and Paul Pellman, President of Hoover‚Äôs were invited by the Software and Information Industry Association to speak to information industry executives about the merits of user generated content vs. traditional content. In explaining the premise that guided ITtoolbox to get 740 advertising customers ‚Äúpaying up to $120 CPM‚Äù in a user generated content model, Morrison said ‚ÄúWe believe community powered models will lead certain segments of business information.‚Äù He provided a two point litmus test ITtoolbox used to identify markets susceptible to this change. First, how will media consumption be distributed between user generated content versus traditional content for a given market? Second, how will ad performance compare? Morrison posited ITtoolbox‚Äôs efforts since 1998 were showing user generated content models were capable of leading certain segments of business information under this litmus test. In July 2007, ITtoolbox was acquired by Corporate Executive Board for $59 million. In October 2008, the online community at ITtoolbox was renamed to \\"Toolbox for IT\\". The new name for the company that operates this online community was established at this time: Toolbox.com. In January 2012, Toolbox.com was acquired by Ziff Davis. In December 2017, Ziff Davis started to roll out a migration to a new world , to quote \\"[sic] The way groups work on the new Toolbox platform is more like LinkedIn groups, [sic] but it‚Äôll be more of a social space of like-minded IT professionals.\\". The email newsgroup style feed, which was the main input channel disappeared along with the majority of the associated messages.

The film was produced by, among others, Guillermo del Toro, director of Pan's Labyrinth, and Alfonso Cuar√≥n, director of Children of Men. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. Overview Set in rural Ecuador, the movie follows a television journalist named Manolo Bonilla (played by John Leguizamo) as he investigates the rape and murder of children in the area. The film also stars Leonor Watling and Jos√© Mar√≠a Yazpik as Manolo's producer and cameraman, respectively. The film was the official Oscar selection from Ecuador in the Best Foreign Language category. Plot summary After traveling to a small village in Ecuador, Miami tabloid news reporter Manolo Bonilla (Leguizamo) witnesses the death of a local boy after Vinicio Cepeda, a traveling salesman, hits the boy with his pickup truck. When Cepeda attempts to back his truck away from the boy, a mob, led by the boy's father, Don Lucho, pulls him from his car, severely beats him, and sets him on fire before the local authorities intervene. After both men are arrested, Cepeda is examined at the jail infirmary and taken to his cell where, later that night, he is attacked by Don Lucho and severely injured. The next morning Manolo Bonilla comes to the prison to interview the men involved. After agreeing to an interview alongside Cepeda, Lucho attacks Cepeda a second time and is taken away. The interview with Cepeda is cancelled due to concerns about Manolo's safety; however, before the reporter leaves, Cepeda notifies him that he has information on the Monster of Babahoyo, a notorious murderer and rapist in the area, and tells him the location where one of the murderer's victims, a nine-year-old girl, is buried. Manolo agrees to interview Cepeda and attempts to free him from prison in exchange for information about the murders. Later that evening Manolo and his cameraman Ivan drive to the location Cepeda mentioned and dig up a shallow grave, indeed containing the body of a small girl. Over the following days Manolo begins interviewing Cepeda, as well as Cepeda‚Äôs wife, son, and babysitter. While interviewing Cepeda, Manolo begins to suspect that Cepeda is, in fact, the Monster of Babahoyo and using him to exonerate himself. After Manolo attempts to get Cepeda to incriminate himself, Cepeda tells him to leave and never come back. Manolo then informs Cepeda that the interview which would free him will not be aired. Manolo calls the authorities and tells them that he had been receiving anonymous calls about the location of the girl's grave. He discovers circumstantial evidence placing Cepeda at the locations of the murders on the dates they occurred; however, despite Manolo's request, the news agency airs Cepeda's interviews which help set Cepeda free. After being interviewed by authorities, Manolo and his crew return to Cepeda's home in search of him only to find that he left his pregnant wife alone at their house and took their son to school before leaving the area. Manolo is offered his own show on the news network and, after deciding against turning over the evidence to the police, the team arrives at the airport and parts ways.

The Dutch Resistance Museum, chosen as the best historical museum of the Netherlands, tells the story of the Dutch people in World War II. From 14 May 1940 to 5 May 1945, the Netherlands were occupied by Nazi Germany. Permanent exhibits of the museum recreate the atmosphere of the streets of Amsterdam during the German occupation of World War II. Big photographs, old posters, objects, films and sounds from that horrible time, help to recreate the scene. The background of the Holocaust is also visualized to the visitor. This is an exhibition about everyday life during that time, but also about exceptional historical events and the resistance of the population against the Nazis and heroism. The museum building The building bearing the Star of David and the name of Petrus Plancius (1550-1622), the Renaissance Amsterdam clergyman and geographer, was built in 1876 by the Jewish singing society Oefening Baart Kunst (practice makes perfect). It served for several decades as a Jewish cultural center and synagogue. The Oefening Baart Kunst society kept the Plancius name on its building to underline its respect to the Amsterdam city traditions. Plancius was the name of the old house located there prior to construction of the building. For a long time, the Plancius building served many different functions. Since 1999, after its renovation, it is the seat of the Verzetsmuseum. Exhibition The Verzetsmuseum is relatively small when compared to other museums in the Netherlands. The focus of Verzetsmusuem is about the German Occupation as well as the Nazi rule in Holland during the second world war between 1940 and 1945. The building is across the entry to Artis Zoo, and not far away from both the Waterlooplein and the Rembrandt house. The museum aptly shows the persecution of Jews by the Nazis and world war two in general.

The ship was one of the Danish vessels idled in U.S. ports seized by the United States after the occupation of Denmark by German forces. The ship was the Danish J. Lauritzen A/S line vessel Maria, ex Caravelle, ex Helga until chartered to the Navy and commissioned on 11 August 1941 under the name Uranus.Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships (DANFS) erroneously has the name as Marie. The name is Maria in all other references, including Maritime Administration records. After return to Danish registry Maria became Maria Dan 1946 under a new Danish naming system after return to Denmark. Uranus served in both the North Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, delivering food, including refrigerated items, to ships operating in the battle areas. The ship was returned to Denmark and later, under new Danish naming rules, named Maria Dan until sold to Greece to be renamed Michael in 1959. The ship was scrapped in 1968.  Commercial service  Uranus (AF-14) was launched 21 December 1932 as the steamship Helga at Helsing√∏r (Elsinore), near Copenhagen, Denmark, by Helsing√∏r Jernskibs og Maskinbyggeri for the shipping company J. Lauritzen A/S and had previously operated as Caravelle (1938 to 1940) and Maria, IMO 5233834 (1940 to 1941). Maritime Administration records show the ship as being and with a Bale Capacity of . The refrigerated ship served in the fruit trade between Denmark and Central American republics. After Germany occupied Denmark on 9 April 1940 inactive ships of Axis or Axis occupied countries in U.S. ports were seized under an Executive Order. Maria was one the Danish vessels seized by the United States Maritime Commission and delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) on 2 August 1941. WSA allocated the ship to the Navy under a bareboat charter agreement on 11 August 1941. Navy service Maria was converted to a naval stores ship by Robbins Drydock Co. yard at Brooklyn, New York. Renamed Uranus and classified AF-14, the ship was placed in commission at Brooklyn on 27 October 1941, Comdr. Orrin J. Hewitt in command. During the ship's subsequent shakedown period, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor; and the United States entered World War II in both oceans. Uranus departed Norfolk, Virginia, on 20 December and arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Christmas Eve. Five days later, she pushed on for Iceland. Uranus served as a floating refrigerated storage vessel and provided stores and provisions to American forces in Iceland into the summer of 1943. During this time, her ports of call included Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur, B√∫√∞areyri, Sey√∞isfj√∂r√∞ur, Reykjav√≠k, and Akureyri. In these inhospitable and unpredictable northern waters, the ship ran aground off Akureyri while on a coastwise passage at 0129 on 10 April 1943, coming to a stop on a sloping gravel beach which was reputedly once the fairway between two holes of a coastal golf course. After repeated attempts, with the assistance of and , the storeship was finally refloated on the 13th. Following repairs, she departed Icelandic waters on 21 August, with men and equipment from a Navy construction battalion on board but, due to contrary winds and currents, did not make port at her Davisville, Rhode Island, destination until 3 September. After discharging passengers, the stores ship proceeded on for New York, arriving three days later. She then pressed south for Norfolk, Virginia, where she soon commenced a lengthy overhaul. Uranus‚Äînow outfitted with a new refrigeration system‚Äîdeparted the U.S. East Coast on 20 December and, five days later, reached a rendezvous with a convoy bound for the Pacific Ocean. Clearing the Panama Canal on the first day of 1944, the stores ship headed on for Pearl Harbor on 3 January, proceeding independently, and reached Oahu on the 23d. She conducted two round-trip Pacific passages between San Francisco, California, and Pearl Harbor and Midway Island, before she sailed for Majuro in the Marshalls. For the remainder of the year 1944, Uranus conducted routine cargo and stores- carrying runs between Midway Island and Pearl Harbor to the west and San Pedro, California, to the east. Overhauled at San Francisco, California, in April 1945, the ship was based at this port for the remainder of the war in the Pacific. She subsequently participated in Operation Magic Carpet operations to bring veterans back to the United States from the erstwhile Pacific battle zones. Decommissioned on 8 May 1946 at Norfolk, Uranus was delivered to the War Shipping Administration of the Maritime Commission on 9 May and was struck from the Navy list on 21 May. Return to commercial service The ship was returned to the Danish government and to her original owner, J. Lauritzen 16 May 1946, re-flagged Danish, registered at Esbjerg, Denmark as Maria Dan modified to carry twelve cadets operating as a school ship in use until 1959. Maria Dan was converted from a school ship and sold in 1959 to Chrisot M. Sarlis, Pir√¶us, Greece and renamed Michael. In 1968, after an engine room fire and declaration as a constructive total loss, the ship was sold for scrap and scrapped at Sveti Kajo, Croatia.

George Dmitrievich Grebenstchikoff (; 6 May [24 April Old Style] 1883 ‚Äì 11 January 1964) was a writer and professor of Russian literature. Personal life Grebenstchikoff was born in Nikolayevsky Rudnik, Tomsk Governorate, Russian Empire (now in East Kazakhstan Province, Kazakhstan). George's mother, Elena Petrovna Grebenstchikoff, encouraged him to learn to read and write at an early age, an uncommon skill in a typical family of miners. He began writing poetry at the age of nine, but his father, Dmitri Lukich Grebenstchikoff, had taken George with him into the lumber industry, thus curtailing any further elementary education. While serving in the Imperial Russian Army during the First World War, he met Tatiana Denisovna Stadnik. Tatiana was serving as a nurse with the Red Cross. She was former ballerina with the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. Career At the age of twelve, George left his hometown for the nearby city of Semipalatinsk to earn a living through a variety of jobs: making postmarks, washing dishes, being an apprentice to a pharmacist, and assisting in a hospital. At fourteen, George became a scribe for the city magistrate and was able to pursue his scholarly interests. He first began publishing his literary work in 1905, writing reviews, reports, and short stories for the local newspapers. In 1909, George published his first play. In the spring of 1909, George toured Moscow and St. Petersburg for the first time. He also visited Leo Tolstoy at the novelist's estate in Yasnaya Polyana. Upon his return home, George surveyed Altai and read lectures with an ethnographic team. George continued his literary profession in Barnaul, where he became editor and journalist for the paper \\"Altai Life.\\" In 1912, George met Maxim Gorky and received influential praise for his writing, establishing himself firmer as an author.George and Tatiana Grebenstchikoff papers, 1910-1964, Immigration History Research Center Archives, University of Minnesota Libraries. Grebenstchikoff published segments of his serialized novel Churaevy before emigrating to Paris (1921) and then the United States (1924). George pursued a prolific literary career in France until meeting Nicholas Roerich in Paris in 1923, a painter who became instrumental in the Grebenstchikoffs' spiritual direction and their subsequent departure for America. As the couple prepared for their final step in emigration, George formed his first publishing company, Alatas, with Roerich. In April 1924, the Grebenstchikoffs arrived in New York and a year later, in 1925, George and Ilia Tolstoi (son of Russian novelist Leo Tolstoi) founded the Churaevka artists' colony in Southbury, Connecticut. The village enjoyed visits from numerous Russian poets, musicians and scientists such as inventor Igor Sikorsky, singer Fyodor Chaliapine and sculptor Sergey Konenkov. Grebenstchikoff continued to direct the Alatas Publishing House, which he operated at Churaevak beginning in 1927. In the early 1940s, the Grebenstchikoffs moved to Lakeland, Florida and began working at Florida Southern College. George taught courses in creative writing and Russian literature, while Tatiana specialized in printing and managed the school's printing press. The couple taught at the University until retirement in 1955. In addition to Churaevy, Grebenstchikoff's principal writings include the novel The Turbulent Giant (1940) and Egorkina zhizn', an autobiographical work.

The current main house on the property, also known as the Faulcon House, dates from 1751. The house has been an example for numerous twentieth century reproductions. It is also known as Warren House and Rolfe- Warren House. and Accompanying photo History The plantation received its name because it was the location of Captain John Smith's \\"New Fort,\\" built in 1609, located directly across the James River from the Jamestown colony. The fort was quickly abandoned due to dry rot and a rat infestation. The same land was later given by Chief Powhatan to John Rolfe as a dowry for the hand of Pocahontas when Rolfe and Pocahontas married. Archaeological surveys of the property have revealed that a number of structures have existed on the property and the present, restored main house was built by Jacob Faulcon in 1751.Hume, Ivor. The Virginia Adventure. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 1994. Smith's Fort Plantation house, 2014 Preservation The property and current house was acquired by Preservation Virginia (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities) in 1933 after undergoing restoration funded by John D. Rockefeller, Jr.. It is currently open as a museum with furnishings from the late 16th through the early 18th centuries. The property serves as a host to the annual Old Virginia Christmas-Festival of Crafts. Archaeological investigations Smith wrote of this fort that it was \\"neere a convenient River upon high commanding hill, very hard to be assaulted an easie to be defended.\\" The Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquites maintains the site now, whose location matches Smith's description. Hume suggests that it makes sense that Smith's description of the fort as a \\"retreat,\\" makes this site a likely spot for trading parties to seek refuge. Archaeological investigations over the site have been limited to the excavations of a ditch and a highly eroded rampart. Further archaeological work to determine if this site was indeed the site of Smith's fort would be necessary. Hume notes that this site does seem to be the site of Smith's fort because the construction type is very similar in nature to the types of earthworks built on Ronoake Island.

A short time later, he served as a missionary for the church in Stratford-on- Avon. Jaques crossed the Atlantic with his wife in 1856 on the Horizon. They landed at Boston and proceeded by train to Iowa City. There they joined the Martin Handcart Company. Jaques' oldest daughter was among the many in that company who died when they were caught in snowstorms in Wyoming. Jaques wrote many poems and other works, including \\"Truth.\\" As a young missionary in Stratford-on-Avon he contemplated Pilate's question to Jesus Christ \\"What is truth?\\". The poem was included in the first (1851) edition of the Pearl of Great Price. It was also set to music by Ellen Knowles Melling, whom Jaques baptized while preaching in Scotland. Entitled \\"Oh Say, What is Truth?\\", the hymn is included in the hymnal of the LDS Church. In 1869 Jaques returned to England for a two-year mission.

Eagle, Eric S. LeBlanc, Blues: A Regional Experience, ABC-CLIO, 2013, p.399 (December 31, 1930 ‚Äì December 29, 1990), known as Goree Carter, was an American singer, guitarist, drummer, songwriter and soldier. He was also credited with the stage names Little T-Bone, Rocky Thompson and Gory Carter, and recorded music in blues genres such as electric blues, jump blues and Texas blues, as well as rock and roll. He is best known for his 1949 single, \\"Rock Awhile,\\" which has been cited by several sources as the first rock and roll record,Robert Palmer, \\"Church of the Sonic Guitar\\", pp. 13-38 in Anthony DeCurtis, Present Tense, Duke University Press, 1992, p. 19. . featuring an over-driven electric guitar style similar to that of Chuck Berry years later. Carter recorded \\"Rock Awhile\\" at the age of 18, and its rediscovery has posthumously brought him recognition as a forefather of rock and roll.Larry Birnbaum (2013), Before Elvis: The Prehistory of Rock 'n' Roll, page 275 As a soldier, he was drafted into military service at the age of 19, and was a veteran of the Korean War. Biography=Early life and career Goree Carter was born in Houston, Texas. He was born in the Fifth Ward, and lived at 1310 Bayou Street.John Nova Lomax (December 2014), Roll Over, Ike Turner, Texas Monthly He began playing blues music at the age of 12, and learned to play on a cousin's guitar. Because there were very few guitarists in his area back then, he had no one to teach him how to play the guitar, so he taught himself how to play it by listening to some of his favorite records on a Victrola machine and picking string-by-string on the guitar. He learned a few chords from listening and then learned more about them from a chord book. When he became a teenager, he began earning a living by hoisting sacks at the local Comet Rice Mill. He had a Gibson guitar and began fronting bands in his early teenage years. Goree Carter and His Hepcats In 1949, he and his jump blues band, The Hepcats, also known as Goree Carter and His Hepcats or Goree Carter & His Hepcats, signed for Freedom Records, a local record label set up by Sol Kahal, and recorded the label's first release, \\"Sweet Ole Woman Blues.\\" Kahal discovered him in either late 1948 or early 1949. As well as Carter's guitar, the band featured two saxophones, a trumpet, piano, bass, and drums. Carter's electric guitar style was influenced by Aaron \\"T-Bone\\" Walker, but was over-driven and had a rougher edge which presaged the sound of rock and roll a few years later. His single-string runs and two-string \\"blue note\\" chords anticipated, and may have influenced, Chuck Berry. At the age of 18, he recorded his best known single \\"Rock Awhile\\" in April 1949. It has been cited as a strong contender for the title of \\"first rock and roll record\\" and a \\"much more appropriate candidate\\" than the more frequently cited \\"Rocket 88\\" (1951) by Ike Turner. The intro to \\"Rock Awhile\\" resembles those in several later Chuck Berry records from 1955 onwards. The music historian Robert Palmer regards \\"Rock Awhile\\" to be a more appropriate candidate for the \\"first rock and roll record\\" title, because it was recorded two years earlier, and because of Carter's guitar work bearing a striking resemblance to Chuck Berry's later guitar work, while making use of an over-driven amplifier, along with the backing of boogie-based rhythms, and the appropriate title and lyrical subject matter. Roger Wood and John Nova Lomax have also cited \\"Rock Awhile\\" as the first rock & roll record.Roger Wood (2003), Down in Houston: Bayou City Blues, pages 46-47, University of Texas Press Carter wrote and recorded the song at Bill Holford's Audiophile Custom Associates Studio. However, \\"Rock Awhile\\" was not as commercially successful as later rock & roll records. Nevertheless, he had some moderate success, touring and recording for a while. Korean War and return to Houston In 1950, at the age of 19, he was drafted into military service. He served as a private first class infantry soldier in the Korean War for over a year. He was in Korea when many of the country's most vicious battles took place. After returning from Korea to Houston around 1951, his musical career began declining. Carter recorded for several labels in the early 1950s, including Imperial, Coral, and Modern, but last recorded in 1954. He wrote a number of songs during this time but said he \\"tore them up\\" because record labels wouldn‚Äôt let him record them, saying he \\"was ahead of\\" himself. Later life and death After leaving the music industry, he continued working at the local Comet Rice Mill until its closure decades later. Carter continued to play occasional local gigs in Houston, and sat-in with visiting artist B.B. King; his last live performance was in 1970.Goree Carter and his Hepcats - Rock Awhile (BB-306) - 1983 mono vinyl release by Blues Boy Records - (Liner notes) Goree Carter quote: \\"So I came back to Houston and I just cleared out a litlle bit. B.B.King would come to town, I'd go up there and sit in with him, and several of the little bands around. But I wasn't gonna do lots of playing\\"......He played his last gig about 1970. He developed arthritis later in his life, and had not been heard from again until 1982, when he was visited at his Fifth Ward home by members of the band Juke Jumpers. He died in Houston, at the age of 59, in 1990. He died at the same house where he was born, and is buried at the Houston National Cemetery. Both his old house at 1310 Bayou and the Audiophile Custom Associates Studio at 612 Westheimer no longer exist.

Biography Enrico was born to a Swiss father, who was a mercenary Swiss guard for the Papacy, stationed in Bologna; Enrico himself rose to become a lieutenant in the force. His younger brother Antonio Maria Haffner (born 1654) also became a painter. While it is sometimes said the Haffner brothers trained with Domenico Maria Canuti, they practiced of quadratura, and seem to have learned more from Baldassare Bianchi and Giovanni Giacomo Monti, as well as the influence of Agostino Mitelli. Enrico did traveled with Canuti to Rome and painted in the church of Santi Domenico e Sisto. Returning to Bologna, under the patronage of the Olivetan prior Taddeo Pepoli, Haffner also worked alongside Canuti, at the convent of San Michele in Bosco, including quadratura above the main altar of the church. Enrico also worked with Marcantonio Franceschini in the church of Corpus Domini and in the Palazzo Marescotti. In November 1661, he worked for the duke of Modena for one year, where he was paid a stipend of 130 lire per month. Again in 1696, he worked with Franceschini and Luigi Quaini in completing frescoes for the main hall of the Ducal Palace of Modena. Haffner worked with Giovanni Antonio Burrini in Santi Giovanni Battista dei Celestini. Enrico worked with Giovanni Gioseffo dal Sole in the Palazzo Bianconcini. Enrico also painted in Savona in the church of Spirito Santo, in the palazzo Gavoti, and in the Balbi Chapel. References * *Ebria Feinblatt.

The FCA was formed in 1999 when negotiations began in Geneva. At first, the organization was a loose group of nongovernmental organizations, universities and others who shared an interest in seeing a strong treaty free from interference from the tobacco industry. Today, the FCA is a nonprofit incorporated in Switzerland with a representative office in Ottawa. The Board of Directors represents all six World Health Organization regions. Membership is free to any organization which shares FCA's vision for tobacco control. FCA's vision is a world free from the devastating health, social, economic and environmental consequences of tobacco and tobacco use. Its mission is to help strengthen the FCTC, support its full and effective implementation worldwide, integrate the FCTC into broader international health and development efforts and seek novel strategies to free the world from tobacco-caused harms. In its Strategic Plan, 2014‚Äì2017, FCA listed six strategic priorities: # Promote and support global health by ensuring the development and implementation of the FCTC, by strengthening the FCTC COP processes and by encouraging whole-of-government and whole-of-society (excluding the tobacco industry) engagement in FCTC implementation; # Further position the tobacco epidemic as a global public health and development priority and promote the FCTC as the best means to address the epidemic; # Mobilise and strengthen global, regional, and national civil society capacity in support of the FCTC; # Monitor the implementation of the FCTC; # Ensure that the FCTC remains relevant and responsive to global changes that affect tobacco use, in particular, changes in the strategies, tactics and behaviour of tobacco companies; # Strengthen FCA's institutional capacity to enable it to meet its strategic priorities. In 2016, FCA's Board of Directors adopted a new planning document: Framework Convention Alliance: 2020 Strategy. The plan is designed to assist the FCTC COP take the treaty to the next step in its development: accelerating implementation of tobacco control measures at country level.

Its role changed through the prime ministerships of John Vorster and PW Botha (later State President), being little used during the formers and during the latter's, controlling all aspects of South African public's lives by becoming the Cabinet. During those years he would implement a Total National Strategy, Total Counter-revolutionary Strategy and finally in the mid-eighties, established the National Security Management System (NSMS). After FW de Klerk's rise to the role of State President, the Cabinet would eventually regain control of the management of the country. After the 1994 elections a committee called National Intelligence Co-ordinating Committee was formed to advise the South African president on security and intelligence as well as its implementation. Early origins On 5 September 1969, Prime Minister John Vorster formed a commission led by Justice H.J. Potgieter to establish the guidelines and mission for intelligence gathering by the Military Intelligence (later DMI) and the Bureau for State Security (BOSS). The Commission to Inquire into Certain Intelligence Aspects of State Security, known better as the Potgieter Commission would investigate the clashes between the two organisations over who had primary responsibility for intelligence gathering in South Africa. As the BOSS head Hendrik van den Bergh was a close ally of the Prime Minister, it was seen by Military Intelligence as a foregone conclusion that BOSS would achieve favour. The Potgieter Commission reported back on the 2 February 1972 and the results were subsequently used to enact the Security Intelligence and State Security Council Act 64 of 1972 on 24 May 1972. Part of this act established the formation of the State Security Council under the control of the cabinet and established it as the government's national centre for operational security. Due to the domination of BOSS, the State Security Council under Vorster would meet infrequently and would be purely advisory. B.J Vorster years and the SSC In October 1974, Vorster initiated a foreign policy of \\"D√©tente\\" seeking support for a constellation of Southern African states who would be a united front against a common enemy, communism. The use of white buffers states began to fail in 1974 with a coup in Portugal, known as the Carnation Revolution, and by 1975 black liberation groups were in control of its colonies of Angola and Mozambique. BOSS was instrumental in organizing the search for influential allies in the region and arranging the meetings. This policy was soon destroyed by the South African invasion of Angola in 1975 and in June 1976 with the Soweto riots. The years between 1974 and 1978 were dominated by infighting as various areas of the government for control of the countries foreign and security policy. Foreign Affairs and the Department of Information argued over foreign policy in South Africa and abroad while BOSS and the military argued over the direction of security policy for the country. In 1977, a Defence White Paper was published and outlined the Total Strategy Plan that would later be implemented and dominate the PW Botha years. This plan envisioned the mobilization of South Africa's military, economic, political and social resources so as to defend and advance the country's interests at home and abroad and also called for an increase in the military budget so as to balance the playing fields relative to the southern African states. In the wake of the Info scandal in which the Bureau of State Security (BOSS) had become mired, the head of the BOSS, Hendrik van den Berg, resigned in June 1978. By 2 October 1978, Prime Minister B.J. Vorster had resigned and on 9 October, the Defence Minister PW Botha was appointed as the new Prime Minister of South Africa. PW Botha years and the SSC Vorster was appointed as State President on 10 October but would resign in May 1979 when the results of the Erasmus Commission of Inquiry into the Information Scandal were released in that year. On 20 November 1978, the Bureau of State Security was brought under tighter control as a cabinet portfolio called National Security managed by Prime Minister who also held the Minister of Defence portfolio. With the rise of PW Botha to prime minister, so the SADF's power increase in cabinet and with that the Directorate Military Intelligence (DMI), who would strive to dominate security issues in the new government and decide its policy and implementation. In October 1978, Deputy Defence and Intelligence Minister Kobie Coetsee was appointed by Prime Minister PW Botha to lead a commission of inquiry into intelligence gathering in South Africa and in particular who would be the lead agency. It was believed that it was predetermined that the DMI would be the lead intelligence agency. PW Botha had decided to split the intelligence gathering ability of South Africa amongst four agencies, the DMI, BOSS/DONS, Security Branch and Foreign Affairs, hoping to reduce the political dominance by one over the others, but the rivalry would continue. On the 12 February 1979, the State Security Council issued guidelines for who could authorize five types of external operations by South African forces. A regional strategy for destabilization was also established to prevent the establishment of ANC bases in those countries. In Angola, the South African strategy was to divide the country, supporting secession in the south of the country, managed by the South African Defence Force (SADF) and DMI. In Mozambique, it meant the building up RENAMO, created by the Rhodesians in opposition to the Mozambican government, and under SADF control by 1980, managed by the DMI's Directorate of Special Tasks. PW Botha described the Westminster system as not appropriate for the country and that in order to implement the Total Strategy, it was necessary to integrate the states resources and overhaul the states political and administrative structures. This rationalization process begun in March 1979 to restructure the states decision making process. It would centralize the power with the prime minister and sideline the cabinet and parliament. A cabinet secretariat was created in the Office of the Prime Minister, with the reduction of Vorster's twenty cabinet advisory committees to four under PW Botha as decision making bodies not advisory, not accountable to the cabinet. These would be the committees of National Security, Constitutional, Economic and Social Affairs, each under a minister appointed by the Prime Minister. The National Security committee would manage the SSC and the National Security Management System, with its decisions not having to be ratified by the Cabinet and only informed of them if required by the Prime Minister. The SSC's strategy was managed by thirteen to fifteen Interdepartmental Committees and implemented through fifteen internal and external Joint Management Centre's. On 16 August 1979, the National Security Management System (NSMS) was established which would integrate the efforts of the entire government and its assets towards protecting the state with the SADF, Police and Intelligence services as the core of the system and managed by the Security Council. In November 1980, PW Botha ordered a Rationalisation Committee be formed to rationalise the intelligence services so as to improve the co-ordination of intelligence in the State Security Council. This committee met between 14 and 19 January 1981 in Simonstown to finalise the functions of each department. This resulted in the Simonstown Accords with the NIS responsible for political and economic intelligence, counter-intelligence and evaluation. DMI would be responsible for military intelligence and contra-mobilisation within South Africa and externally. The Security Branch would be responsible for counter- subversion within South Africa and externally. By 1985, the South African government realized that its 1983 Tricameral Parliament and its new constitution was a failure as it left out black representation and was responsible for the loss of control of the large townships in the Vaal Triangle and the Eastern Cape to the ANC and its revolutionary struggle. On the 21 July 1985, PW Bothas declared a State of Emergency to counter the violence in magisterial districts representing one-third of the country. PW Botha delivered his Rubicon speech to the world on 15 August 1985 that failed to announce the release of Nelson Mandela and the end of Apartheid, rather continuing the current policy. The negative speech had serious financial implications with a drop in the value of the Rand and the reduction of international loans, caused the SSC to realize that the Total Onslaught was not just by communist forces but also had a component of Western hostility. In April 1986, the SSC developed guidelines to adopt a counter-revolutionary war by using anti-revolutionary groups within South Africa to counter the arming of black communities by ANC by arming and training anti-ANC groups. On 9 May 1986, the SSC received a document concerning a new force to counter revolutionary forces and consensus was reached in the council to create the force. This resulted in the formation of the Civil Cooperation Bureau (CCB) with the front company was launched by the South African Special Forces that May. In June 1986, Operation Marion was approved by the SSC with the DMI responsible for training Zulu Inkatha paramilitary forces to counter ANC forces in the townships and this strategy would be attempted in the Ciskei and the Transkei. On 12 June 1986, the governments State of Emergency, cancelled on 7 March 1986, was re-extended to the whole country. Its purpose was to restore law and order, normalise life in the townships so as to create a circumstance for constitutional, economic and social development. Council membership The Act called for the following persons to be members of the State Security Council: * Prime Minister * Minister of Defence * Minister of Foreign Affairs * Minister of Justice * Minister of Police * Chief of the Defence Force * Chief of the South African Police * Director-General of Bureau for State Security (BOSS) (later National Intelligence Service (NIS)) * Secretary of Foreign Affairs * Secretary of Justice and anyone one else required to aid the discussions. Organisational Structure The State Security Council (SSC) presided over the National Security Management System (NSMS) of President P.W. Botha's National Party Government in South Africa. Its function was to advise the government on formulating and executing national security policy. Botha himself chaired the SSC, which was served by a secretariat of 100 full-time staff seconded from other government departments. The SSC had four divisions: * Strategy Planning Branch (Strategy Branch) * Strategic Communications (Stratkom) * National Intelligence Interpretation Branch, (NIIB) and * Administration Branch  Secretariat  Established in 1979, these are the three secretaries of the State Security Council: * Lt Gen A.J. van Deventer (19791985) * Lt Gen Pieter van der Westhuizen (19851988) * Lt Gen Charles Lloyd (19881990) Deputy secretary for most of the 1980s was Major-General J.F van Rensburg. Strategy Branch The Strategy Planning Branch developed the national governments strategy which was done through a Total Planning Cell made up of thirteen interdepartmental committees that would develop Total Strategies; security, economic, social and constitutional to counter the Total Onslaught. Stratkom The Strategic Communication branch developed strategies and policies for combating the ‚ÄúTotal Onslaught‚Äù by organisations opposed to South African government and were developed in conjunction with the Strategy and the National Intelligence Interpretation Branches. One of its aims was to discredit anti-apartheid organisations, neutralise anti-apartheid propaganda against the South African government and promote a positive image of the anti-communist organisations operating in Southern Africa. This was done by way of two means, one using the Bureau of Information to overtly sell the message of the South African government departments and secondly, covertly sell the South African governments message to the country or world through organisations not officially aligned to it. A second aim would be to develop strategies such as assassination, attacks, economic sabotage, character assassination and front companies against anti- apartheid organisations. By 1984, it was said that this branch consisted of around 2650 people of which 1930 were members of the SADF. National Intelligence Interpretation Branch (NIIB) The purpose of this branch was co-ordinate the gathering of intelligence by the different South African intelligence and security organisations such as National Intelligence Service (NIS), Directorate Military Intelligence (DMI), Security Branch and Foreign Affairs intelligence committee. Its second purpose was to interpret all national security and intelligence gathered by the above bodies and provide a national intelligence brief to the South African government. The NIIB would come into existence on 1 January 1982 and the NIS would provide most of the analysts for this branch. Administration Branch As its name implies, this branch supplied the administrative staff required to assist the secretariat. Other SSC committees KIK ‚Äì Koordineer Inligting Komitee ‚Äì Co-ordinating Intelligence Committee Formed on 30 January 1981, also known as the ‚ÄúK‚Äù Committee and chaired by Neil Barnard, its role was to co-ordinate activities and intelligence between all intelligence agencies and the non- security agencies. It had a number of sub-committees: Covert Collection (later called TREWITS), Open Information Gathering, Technical, Evaluation (later became NIIB), Counter Espionage and Security Intelligence. TREWITS ‚Äì Teen Rewolusionere Inligting Taakspan ‚Äì Counter-revolutionary Intelligence Task Team Formed during 1985, its role was to identify targets for action and or elimination as well as gather intelligence for such operations, with the specific aim of improving the co-ordination of the various security forces. It was under the command of the Security Branch and a sub-committee of KIK; it had members from the NIS, Security Branch, DMI and Special Forces. TREWITS would interact with the Joint Management Centres through the VEIKOM committees. This committee closed in early 1992 and its documents were destroyed. Joint Management Centres The core of the implementation of the NSMS was the Joint Management Centre. This was a network of regional, district and local committees or Joint Management Centres (JMCs) which reported on the activities and location of political activists so as to form an overall security profile, thus enabling decisions on security action to be taken. Such action included assassination of people opposed to the apartheid government's policies, and the widespread use of abduction, arson, sabotage and torture. The SSC put pressure on the security forces to \\"engage robustly\\" against persons and organisations opposed to the government. The Joint Management Centres had two main roles. One, to obtain intelligence in the areas of the country they operated especially the activities of the African National Congress (ANC), Pan-African Congress (PAC) and later in the mid- eighties, the United Democratic Front (UDF) but essentially any organisation the SSC thought acted against the interests of the state. Its secondary role, that was neglected due to the overriding interests of the security and intelligence brief, was the implementation of the executive strategy and policy to improve the socio-economic and political affairs in the regions controlled by the JMC which were the three of the four pillars of the governments Total Strategy. These roles could be defined as through military control, bring stability to the townships, restoring the role of the state in those communities which would legitimise the states role and finally in the long term anticipating and controlling future resistance through the implementation of political, social and economic reform. =Structure= There were twelve JMC's based in each province and capital city which replicated the SADF command regions and under the command of a SADF Brigadier, except the Western Cape and Witwatersrand, which were under the command of a South African Police (SAP) Divisional Commander. There were also five external JMC's, Walvis Bay, Namibia Command, Southern Command (five Black Homelands), Northern Command (Frontline States) and Angola. The internal JMC'c were broken down into further three levels. There were sixty Sub-JMC's under the control of a SAP district commander and roughly covered the country's police districts. Mini-JMC's with 450 in total which covered the South African magisterial districts and represented by a local SAP commander. Last level of control of South African society was through Local Management Centres (LMC) which would be based in city and towns. Information would move back and forth from the lowest levels to the JMC, then SSC, its working committee and finally the cabinets and prime minister or state president. The following seven components made up each Joint Management Centres and were replicated to a large extent in the lower levels of the Sub and Mini JMC's and was itself similar to the State Security Council's structure: * Executive Committee ‚Äì this was made up by the head of the individual JMC and the committee heads listed below * Secretariat ‚Äì administration of the JMC * Security Committee (SECCOM/VEIKOM) ‚Äì main aim was to plan, monitor and co-ordinate the security forces. The operational role was under the command of a SAP commander through a Joint Operations Centre. Members of this committee included the SAP, SADF, NIS, Security Police, Railway Police, Civil defence, Commandos and state and provincial officials * Joint Intelligence Committee (JICOM/GIKOM) ‚Äì main aim was to provide daily intelligence to the other committees. The operational role was under the command of an Army Intelligence commander through a Joint Intelligence Centre. Members of this committee included the Directorate Military Intelligence (DMI), NIS, Security Police, Prisons Service, Kitskonstabels, private security firms and provincial, regional and local affairs * Communication Committee (COMCOM/KOMKOM) ‚Äì main aim was to compile and disseminate propaganda in their area of JMC. Members of this committee consisted of the SAP, SADF and Bureau of Information * Constitutional, Economic and Welfare Committee ‚Äì main aim was to implement the National Welfare Management strategy of the government. Members included civil servants from housing, finance, constitutional affairs and pensions * Liaison Committee ‚Äì communication with the public sector FW De Klerk years and the SSC PW Botha suffered a stroke in January 1989 and by 14 August 1989 he had resigned due to ill health. FW de Klerk was first appointed to the role of acting South African President and then on 20 September as State President. During November 1989, de Klerk began to abolish the National Security Management System which would begin to reign in the power the military and security establishment had over the government's civilian decision making processes. With the SSC reduced to an advisory body, the JMC's were reduced to civilian run regional and co- ordinating centres no longer under SAP and DMI control. De Klerk formed a Cabinet Committee for Security, with the State President and his ministers as members with decision making and co-ordination for national security now under civilian control. The dismantling of military and security power continued under de Klerk with the permission for marches and rallies, the reduction of national military service to one year and the return of foreign diplomacy as opposed to regional destabilisation in southern Africa. Judicial commissions of inquiries and investigations begun into the SAP and DMI as well as the use of third forces and death squads which resulted in the suspension of the CCB in February 1990 and its dismantling in July of the same year. The military and police intelligence services were reduced to purely internal matters while the power of the NIS rose becoming responsible for external intelligence and as an advisor to the State President. In a statement on the death of former president P.W. Botha in 2006, his successor, F.W. de Klerk, said: In August 2007, de Klerk was challenged to say what he knew about the atrocities carried out at the behest of the SSC. The Guardian quoted de Klerk as replying that although he was a member of the cabinet it was not briefed \\"on clandestine operations involving murders, assassinations or the like - all of which were evidently carried out strictly on a 'need to know' basis\\". The same newspaper report alleged that, in his last months as president in 1994, de Klerk ordered the wholesale shredding and incineration of tons of documents, microfilm and computer tapes that dealt with matters such as the chain of command in covert operations. New security structure and post 1994 investigations A Transitional Executive Council (TEC) was formed by an act of parliament in September 1993 and was made up of members of the political parties who had negotiated the transition to free and fair elections that would take place in April 1994. The TEC would essentially run the country until the election and was made up of seven sub-committees, composed of members of the negotiating political parties, with one of those committees responsible for intelligence. This committee was called the Sub-Council on Intelligence and was established in November 1993. The committees role was to find a solution to the structure of South Africa's future intelligence service which would be acceptable to all six intelligence services of the various political parties in country. These six intelligence organisations consisted of the NIS, Department of Intelligence and Security (ANC), Pan African Security Service (PAC), and the three intelligence services of Venda, Transkei and Bophuthatswana. The second role of the Sub-Council on Intelligence of the TEC, was the daily operation of the country's intelligence and security services. This would be done by means of a Joint Coordinating Intelligence Committee (JCIC) but as the NIS opposed ANC control over the services, the JCIC role changed to one of coordination and investigation of the intelligence services as well as the supply of intelligence to the TEC and the other sub-councils. The JCIC would eventually evolve into the Heads of Combined Services (HOCS) and in 1995 become the National Intelligence Co-ordinating Committee (NICOC). TRC Investigation into the SSC In a 1998 report on the former South African government and its security forces, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) castigated South Africa's last hard-line apartheid president P.W. Botha and held him responsible for gross human rights violations, including all violence sanctioned by the State Security Council. The report said: > By virtue of his position as head of state and chairperson of the State > Security Council (SSC), Botha contributed to and facilitated a climate in > which ... gross violations of human rights did occur, and as such is > accountable for such violations. The TRC also found that the SSC had contributed to the prevailing culture of impunity by failing to recommend that action be taken against those members of the security forces who were involved in gross human rights violations. SSC and Samora Machel In 1996, the TRC conducted a special investigation into the 1986 aircrash in which president Samora Machel of Mozambique was killed. The investigation was unable to prove an allegation that South Africa was behind the Mozambican Tupolev Tu-134 air disaster, but the TRC stated in its report: > South Africa's State Security Council (SSC) minutes from January 1984 > indicate that the Mozambican working group, including General Jac Buchner > and Major Craig Williamson, discussed how to help RENAMO overthrow the > FRELIMO government of Mozambique.

The Cube (game)  The Cube is a Kokology game about self knowledge and is played by asking a person to imagine and describe a set of three to five objects. The game is usually played by two people. One person is designated as the narrator, and the other is the interpreter. Usually these roles are swapped after successful interpretation. The Cube is a way of judging somebody's personality by the way they narrate the following. While there are slight variations of the game from person to person, the game begins by asking another person to imagine a desert (or room) scene. The game then follows by asking the person to place and describe a cube in the scene. Once the cube is completely described, the narrator of the game then asks for the player to describe a ladder that is also placed in the scene.

This perceptual disorder arises when there is an abnormally increased signal at any point between the olfactory receptors and the olfactory cortex. The causes of hyperosmia may be genetic, hormonal, environmental or the result of benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. When odorants enter the nasal cavity, they bind to odorant receptors at the base of the olfactory epithelium. These receptors are bipolar neurons that connect to the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, traveling through the cribriform plate. At the glomerular layer, axons from the olfactory receptor neurons intermingle with dendrites from intrinsic olfactory bulb neurons: mitrial/tufted cells and dopaminergic periglomerular cells. From the olfactory bulb, mitral/tufted cells send axons via the lateral olfactory tract (the cranial nerve I) to the olfactory cortex, which includes the piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, and parts of the amygdala. From the entorhinal cortex, axons extend to the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, which then proceed to the orbitofrontal cortex. Causes=Genetics A study by Menashe et al. has found that individuals with a single nucleotide polymorphism variant in the OR11H7P pseudogene have a lower receptor activation threshold for isovaleric acid. These individuals are hyperosmic for this single odorant. Another study by Keller et al. has found that people with the intact human odorant receptor OR7D4 are more sensitive to androstenone and androstadienone and thus find them unpleasant (individuals with the semi- functional OR7D4 have two non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the OR7D4 pseudogene, resulting in two amino acid substitutions). There has not yet been extensive research into the genetic background of those with general hyperosmia, rather than for just a single odorant. Environmental There has not been extensive research into environmental causes of hyperosmia, but there are some theories of some possible causes. In a study by Atianjoh et al., it has been found that amphetamines decrease levels of dopamine in the olfactory bulbs of rodents. On this basis, it has been hypothesized that amphetamine use may cause hyperosmia in rodents and humans, but further research is still needed. Anecdotal support for the belief that amphetamines may cause hyperosmia comes from Oliver Sacks's account of a patient (who he later revealed to be himself) with a heightened sense of smell after taking amphetamines. It has been observed that the inhalation of hydrocarbons can cause hyperosmia, most likely due to the destruction of dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb. Methotrexate, administered in the treatment of psoriasis, has been known to cause hyperosmia, and may be more likely to do so in patients with a history of migraines. Abstract. However, this is only an observation and not part of a study; therefore, it is yet to be verified. Treatment Normal olfactory acuity will usually return over time if the cause is environmental, even if it is untreated. The hyperosmic person may need to be removed from strong odorants for a period of time if the sensation becomes unbearable. Before they had been discontinued due to undesirable side effects, butyrophenones or thioridazine hydrochloride, both of which are dopamine antagonists, have been used to treat hyperosmia.

In this adaptation written by William H. Macy and Steven Schachter, Charlie Gigot is the mute and alcoholic superintendent of a dilapidated New York City apartment building. He becomes the unwilling parent figure for Lou, a young girl temporarily left in his care by a woman who fails to return for her. The two and Gigot's pet monkey struggle to make it through the winter in his ramshackle basement apartment while he tries to find someone willing to take her in. The film, a co-production of Viacom Productions and 20th Century Fox Television, was shot in Atlanta, Georgia and Montr√©al, Qu√©bec, Canada. Directed by Schachter, it starred Macy as Charlie and Keke Palmer as Lou, with Don Rickles, Ned Beatty, Cherise Boothe, Julito McCullum, and Catherine O'Hara in supporting roles. The film premiered on November 21, 2004 on TNT. It has been released on videotape and DVD. Fox owns the international ancillary rights, while North American ancillary rights are now in the hands of CBS Television Studios. Paramount Pictures handles video distribution for the CBS library, though this particular program was released on DVD before the Viacom/CBS split. Plot In New York City, Charles Gigot (William H. Macy) is an alcoholic, disgruntled hearing-mute and superintendent of an apartment building with eccentric tenants. One day, he meets Lou (Keke Palmer), a young girl who lives with her mother Arlene (Cherise Booth) and her boyfriend, Bernard (Edward Yankie). When Gigot suspects that their apartment may have been broken into, he investigates, only to encounter two thugs looking for the couple. His presence creates a diversion that allows Lou, who had been in hiding, to escape to the basement with her mother. Despite Gigot's protestations, Arlene leaves Lou in Gigot's care for an indefinite time while she sorts things out with Bernard. Annoyed at having his solitude compromised, Gigot attempts to ignore Lou completely, but her brash and back-talking attitude makes her unbearable. Lou is equally uncomfortable with Gigot's spartan style of living ‚Äì he has no food in the apartment, drinks frequently, and is emotionally distant. In fact, his only friends seem to be his pet monkey, Grace, and Gloria (Catherine O'Hara), a middle-aged prostitute. Wanting to find a relative with whom Lou can live, he learns from the apartment's lease that Lou has an aunt named Cheryl who lives in Philadelphia. They travel via bus to Cheryl's house, but Gigot is unsuccessful in convincing her to take Lou, learning that Arlene and Cheryl hate one another and that Cheryl does not consider Lou a relative. Realizing that finding Arlene is the only solution to the dilemma, Gigot and Lou research one of her contacts, who sends them to an apartment building in the city. Gigot goes in alone and discovers that the place is a crack house and that Arlene has become a drug addict. Seeing a dead-end, Gigot's only option is to return home with Lou. Things become even more complicated, however, when he is robbed at a diner and is forced to perform a sideshow featuring Grace and Lou to raise enough money for the bus tickets. During this course of events, Gigot and Lou bond and she comes to live with him permanently. Lou's influence causes Gigot to stop drinking and to help her with her education (he realizes that she is almost illiterate and two years older than the rest of her class). They develop a father-daughter relationship with Lou helping Gigot grieve when local thugs poison Grace in an act of revenge for Gigot disposing of drugs belonging to one of their members. Eventually, policemen visit the apartment building and inform Gigot that Arlene died from an overdose. He attempts to shield Lou from the truth, but is forced to tell her while on a trip to a theme park. Her grief prompts Gigot to seek out a friend named Clarence (Tyrone Benskin) who served with him in Vietnam and has since become a foster parent for multiple children without homes. Clarence and his wife, Bess, however, announce that they are retired, leaving Gigot with no other choice but to become a foster parent himself after Child Protective Services arrives to claim Lou. The process comes to a halt, however, when Gigot's jail-time prevents him from being a candidate and a proposal of marriage to Gloria is refused. At this point, Gigot's only chance is his parents, whom he hasn't seen in twenty-eight years. Hoping that they will officially adopt Lou so that he may take care of her, Gigot pays them a visit and is shocked to learn that his mother died years ago and his father (Ned Beatty) has since remarried. During an argument, it is revealed that Gigot's downward spiral into alcoholism and virtual isolation were a result of post-traumatic stress from his time in Vietnam. The titular wool cap, which he wears throughout the film, belonged to his younger sister who died in a car accident while Gigot was at the wheel, drunk and high. Hurt by Gigot's indifference throughout the years, his father rejects him and his request to adopt Lou. Meanwhile, being a foster child is hard on Lou, who falls into a life of waywardness. She is eventually arrested for shop-lifting and put into juvenile hall where she refuses to see Gigot, having given up hope on ever finding a home. Depressed and utterly forlorn, Gigot attempts to start afresh on Christmas Day by letting go of the past (symbolized by throwing his sister's wool cap into a river) and visiting a church, where he breaks down crying. On coming home, he finds his stepmother and father waiting for him at the apartment building. After a brief hesitation, Gigot and his father embrace, a sign that they will begin to repair their relationship. Later that evening, Gigot visits Lou at juvenile hall and introduces her to his father. Using sign language, he tells her that he would like to adopt her. In a subtle imitation of Gigot, she becomes speechless and wordlessly accepts. The film jumps forward a year. It is winter again and Gigot has since become the manager of his father's business. He goes to pick up Lou from school where she has become an excellent student. The two are seen driving off together and laughing, happy to have found one another.

In Tagalog folklore, the creature is called Bangungot. The batibat takes the form of an ancient, grotesquely obese, tree-dwelling female spirit. They usually come in contact with humans when the trees in which they reside are felled and are made homeless, especially when their tree is made into a support post for a house. This causes them to migrate and inhabit what is left of their tree. The batibat forbids humans from sleeping near its post. When a person does sleep near it, the batibat transforms into its true form and attacks the person by suffocating their victim and invading their dream space, causing sleep paralysis and waking nightmares. This condition lends itself to the Ilocano word for nightmare, \\"bat√≠bat\\" (or bangungot in Tagalog). To ward off the batibat, one should bite one's thumb or wiggle one's toes. In this way, the person will awaken from the nightmare induced by the batibat. In popular culture * The creature appears in the fifth episode of the Netflix series Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, played by Megan Leitch. This version of Batibat is depicted in the episode \\"Dreams in a Witch House\\" as a demon that is unintentionally released by Sabrina Spellman from a puzzle belonging to her father. Trapped in the house, Batibat proceeds to vengefully torture the Spellman family by inducing their dream states.

The Cheka doesn't want them to flee, and Yashka, disguised as a pick-pocket, is put in Naryshkin's cell and arranges his escape. He gains Naryshkin's trust and enters the perpetrators gang. They enter the museum at night, only to find the crown stolen by Ovechkin alone! Ovechkin flees Moscow by train, Ksanka pursues him, but loses the trail when he hides in Odessa catacombs. He is waiting to be picked up by a ship and successfully escape with the crown. Danka and Valerka immediately go to Paris, where they learn that Monsieur Duc didn't want to use the crown for coronation. Instead, Duc wanted to sell it for millions of dollars. After Kudasov tells that, he is shot by his former aide, Lieutenant Perov, who now works for Monsieur Duc along with Ovechkin. Duc's minions, led by Perov, hijack a ship to pick up Ovechkin and carry the crown to Cape Town. Unfortunately, Danka and Valerka are aboard. When the ship picks up Ovechkin and the crown, Yashka, Ksanka and Naryshkin board it to thwart Perov's plan.

Summary Shadows of Memory caps a series of documentaries von Alemann filmed on the history of Germany, this time turning her lens on the Holocaust. She returns to the town of her family's origins where the lush landscapes contrast with the jarring truth her mother shares with daughter and granddaughter. Letting their conversation flow naturally, the intimate documentary explores how anti-Semitism developed in Germany and how average citizens ignored the evils of the Holocaust. Alemann juxtaposes the serenity and placidity of the nature shots with the brutality and horrors her speakers are forced to address. They sit on park benches or walk down forested paths, but the intensity of their thoughts distract them from the beauty of their surroundings. The film opens with the documentary maker herself sitting on the edge of a lush pond with her mother. While the beauty of the lavish greens, the warm sun, the gentle rustling of the water cannot be ignored, the loaded conversation quickly begins to dominate the viewer's attention. And that is not the only contrast in appearance. Many people would be embarrassed to admit their own ignorance and prejudice, but von Alemann's mother is unafraid. With her curly white hair, glasses, and a soft face full of wrinkles, she looks like a benevolent, cookie-baking, story-telling grandmother. But her stories reveal the role she played in perpetuating a prejudice that lead to genocide. Raised in the small Christian town of Seebach, she was led to believe Germans were an especially brave, hardworking, and moral race. She had no direct experience with Jews, so when she was told as a child that Jews had \\"crooked noses and crooked legs\\" she accepted the slander blindly. When she was introduced to Jews for the first time, at a dance, she was surprised and commented to a friend, \\"They‚Äôre just like us.\\" Still, as a young adult reading Hitler's Mein Kampf, she sympathized with, and felt excited by, the pro-German sentiment, while glossing over the anti- Semitism. And she was proud of her husband for serving as a commanding soldier in the German army. Shadows of Memory lets camera linger on the faces of the speakers, picking up on the thoughts their expressions reveal that their words do not. The unrelenting camera also traps the speakers in its grasp, forcing them to confront the difficult subjects they are discussing. Just as the camera does not look away, the characters cannot ignore the horrors that have transpired in their own land, on their own watch. Misty eyes blink repeatedly, lips are bitten, and faces contort in an attempt to control overwhelming sorrow and frustration. The documentary explores how one person's actions affect other people. While von Alemann's mother was not directly involved in the torture or murder of Europe's Jews, her ignorance, compliance and nationalism allowed the atrocities to occur. The effects of her inaction ‚Äì and that of the ordinary German citizens of her generation ‚Äì continue, rippling down to her granddaughter's generation as well. The seventeen-year-old girl is forced to grapple with frustration, shame, and sorrow that is the legacy left by her grandmother.

Location The camp at Larton, then in Cheshire, was actually located from West Kirby village, from which it took its name. The camp entrance was on Saughall Massie Road, almost opposite Oldfield Lane. History It was set up at the beginning of the Second World War, as a basic training camp, to train new recruits into the Royal Air Force. Known as a \\"square bashing camp\\" in the vernacular, it was very first base (after kitting out at RAF Cardington) of most personnel there during the 1940s to 1960, although the final passing out parade took place on 20 December 1957. Most of the personnel were newly called up in the rank of AC2, the very lowest rank in the RAF, for their 2 years National Service in the British armed forces. At this RAF Station, the men were given their initial training on their first entry into RAF which included first learning the RAF parade ground drill. with rifles, intensive physical fitness training, training in ground combat and defence under non-commissioned officers of the RAF Regiment and some education about the RAF and its history. Men, while undergoing their basic training at West Kirby, were accommodated in wooden barrack huts, each one housing about twenty men. Because West Kirby was a basic training camp, with no airfield there, discipline was very much stricter than in any normal RAF operational or trade training camp. Recruits normally spent a period of eight weeks, (later on 6 weeks) on their training at West Kirby before being posted on to their \\"trade training\\" camp elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Approximately 150,000 conscripts went through its gates up until 1960, when the camp was demolished and the land converted back into farming fields. A dedication plaque was installed, where the camp entrance used to be, in 2004. Later, a commemorative stone was installed.

In peacetime before and after the war she carried fruit and passengers; in US Navy service she supplied troops and ships in the Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II. Building and pre-war service The Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Newport News, Virginia built the ship as SS Talamanca. She was one of six sister ships driven by turbo-electric transmission. United Fruit placed Talamanca on express liner services between Central America and New York. US Navy service The US Navy bareboat chartered her from the United Fruit Company through the Maritime Commission on 16 December 1941. The Maryland Drydock Co of Baltimore, Maryland converted her for Navy use and she was designated AF-15 on 27 December 1941. She was commissioned on 28 January 1942, commanded by Cmdr Nathan W. Bard. Pacific Theater operations Talamanca sailed for the first time as a naval vessel on 13 February. Six days later, laden with cargo, passengers and mail, she transited the Panama Canal. She proceeded via Talara, Peru, across the southern Pacific and reached Wellington Harbour, New Zealand on 16 March. She then made a round trip across the Tasman Sea to Melbourne, Australia and back to Wellington. On 1 April she sailed for the United States. She called at Manzanillo, Mexico on the 16th and reached San Francisco, California, on 21 April. Between 9 May and 1 June, she made a round trip from San Francisco to Pearl Harbor and back. Shes spent the whole of June in the Mare Island Navy Yard, undergoing further conversion and some repairs. Talamanca left San Francisco on 8 July with a Hawaii-bound convoy. She reached Pearl Harbor on the 16th and stayed there for five days loading fuel and stores before heading southwest on the 21st. On 1 August she left the convoy, headed via the Fiji for New Zealand, reaching Auckland on the 7th. For the next three years Auckland was Talamanca's home port. Between August 1942 and April 1945, she plied the southwestern Pacific supplying US bases. She visited such places as Fiji; Espiritu Santo; Efate; Manus; and Napier, New Zealand. The closest she ever came to the combat zone were stops at Guadalcanal, Tulagi, Florida Island, and the Russell Islands in the Solomon Islands. However, these voyages were in 1944 after the fighting had moved up the Solomons chain past Bougainville and into the Bismarck Archipelago. In all, Talamanca made 36 resupply voyages from Auckland to various bases in the South Pacific and back again, all of them relatively routine. On 28 April 1945 Talamanca left Auckland for the last time. She headed to Noumea, New Caledonia, thence to Manus, and then to the Marianas. She reached Saipan on 10 May; discharged some of her cargo; and, on the 15th, went to Tinian where she discharged the rest of her cargo. From Tinian she sailed via Eniwetok Atoll for the West Coast of the United States. She entered San Pedro, California, on 2 June 1945 and loaded cargo. On the 9th she returned to the western Pacific. After fuel and water stops at Pearl Harbor and Eniwetok, Talamanca entered Apra Harbor, Guam, on 26 June. She unloaded her cargo and, four days later, sailed for Manus. She reached Manus on 3 July, embarked patients from the hospital for transport and left on 5 July for the United States. She called at Pearl Harbor on 13 July and entered San Francisco Bay on the 19th. End-of- war duties Her passengers disembarked, Talamanca moored at a pier at the Moore Dry Dock Co. for overhaul. Overhaul and repairs were completed on 31 August, and after degaussing, compass compensation, and trials she began loading cargo on 3 September. On the 9th, she left San Francisco Bay for Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on the 14th. Two days later she left for Eniwetok where she stopped on the 23rd for fuel and water. From there she went to Guam, and thence to Iwo Jima where she unloaded cargo. On 8 October Talamanca left Iwo Jima with passengers for Saipan, where she arrived that afternoon. Her passengers disembarked that day and her cargo was unloaded the next day. After calling at Guam to embark passengers she left for Hawaii and the United States. She called at Pearl Harbor from 27 to 29 October and then continued to Panama. Talamanca reverted to her original employment as a fruit carrier on 10 November when she loaded bananas at Puerto Armuelles, Panama, for the War Shipping Administration. She transited the canal on the 13th and sailed for New Orleans, Louisiana, the next day. Talamanca reached New Orleans on the 18th and was decommissioned there on 29 November 1945. She was returned to the War Shipping Administration for eventual return to her owners. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 19 December 1945 and she was returned to United Fruit Company in 1946. Post-war civilian service In 1958 United Fruit transferred Talamanca and her sisters Quirigua and Veragua to its British subsidiary Elders and Fyffes. Talamanca was renamed SS Sulaco after an earlier Fyffes ship of the same name. As Sulaco the ship served in the Fyffes fleet until she was retired in 1964. On 28 July that year she arrived in Bruges, Belgium to be scrapped. She was broken up in 1965.
