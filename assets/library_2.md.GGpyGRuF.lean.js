Most of the Romano-berber colonies were in the areas in red and pink. Roman colonies in Berber Africa are the cities ‚Äîpopulated by Roman citizens‚Äî created in Berber North Africa by the Roman Empire, mainly in the period between the reigns of Augustus and Trajan. These colonies were created in the area‚Äînow called Tamazgha by the Berbers‚Äîlocated between Morocco and Libyan Tripolitania. Characteristics Since the second half of the first century BC and as a result of increasing communities of Roman citizens living in the North African centers, Rome started to create colonies in North Africa. The main reason was to control the area with Roman citizens, who had been legionaries in many cases. The second reason was to give land and urban properties to the Roman military troops who had fought for the Roman Empire and so decrease the demographic problem in the Italian peninsula. The third reason was to facilitate the Romanization of the area and so the integration of the local Berbers -through marriage and other relationships- in the Roman Empire's social and cultural world. It is indicative that two of the main characteristics of the Roman world, Latin language and Christianity, were increased to nearly full acceptance by the Berber autochthonous population (from nearly zero at the times of Augustus) after the four centuries of Roman dominance in what is now called \\"Maghreb\\": this was done even through the creation and development of the Roman colonies, according to historian Theodore Mommsen.Mommsen, Theodore. \\"The Provinces of the Roman Empire\\". Chapter: Roman Africa Indeed under Theodosius the area east of the Fossa regiaCamps: Fossa Regia was fully Romanized with one third of the population made of Italian colonists and their descendants, according to historian Theodore Mommsen. The other two thirds were Romanized Berbers, who were all Christians and nearly all Latin speaking. Furthermore in the same century in the area between Fossa Regia and the Fossatum Africae of the Roman limes, where was expanded -further west of the Fossa Regia- the process of Romanization after Augustus, the Roman colonists and descendants were nearly 20% of the population. They were concentrated around Cirta with surrounding confederated cities and around Thamugadi in the Aures region, while the remaining 80% was made of Berbers of whom only 25% were not fully assimilated and still spoke autochthonous berber language. Nearly all of them worshipped Christianity (and a few even Judaism). The prosperity of most towns depended on agriculture. Called the \\"Granary of the Empire\\",Detailed Map of the \\"Granary of the Roman Empire\\" with its Roman-berber cities and villages (actual eastern Algeria and northern Tunisia) Romano-berber North Africa produced one million tons of cereals each year, one-quarter of which was exported. Additional crops included beans, figs, grapes, and other fruits. By the second century, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item. In addition to the cultivation of slaves, and the capture and transporting of exotic wild animals, the principal production and exports included the textiles, marble, wine, timber, livestock, pottery such as African Red Slip, and wool. The incorporation of colonial cities into the Roman Empire brought an unparalleled degree of urbanization to vast areas of territory, particularly in North Africa. This level of rapid urbanization had a structural impact on the town economy, and artisan production in Roman cities became closely tied to the agrarian spheres of production. As Rome's population grew, so did her demand for North African produce. This flourishing trade allowed the North African provinces to increase artisan production in rapidly developing cities, making them highly organized urban centers. Many Roman cities shared both consumer and producer model city aspects, as artisanal activity was directly related to the economic role cities played in long-distance trade networks.Wilson, A. I., 2002. Papers of the British School at Rome. Vol 70, Urban Production in the Roman World: The View from North Africa. London: British School at Rome. 231-73. The urban population became increasingly engaged in the craft and service sectors and less in agrarian employment even Byzantine times,[6] until a significant portion of the town‚Äôs vitality came from the sale or trade of products through middlemen to markets in areas both rural and abroad. The changes that occurred in the infrastructure for agricultural processing, like olive oil and wine production, as trade continued to develop both cities and commerce directly influenced the volume of artisan production. The scale, quality, and demand for these products reached its acme in Roman North Africa.Gabriel Camps. \\"Rex gentium Maurorum et Romanorum. Recherches sur les royaumes de Maur√©tanie des VIe et VIIe si√®cles\\" Berber Africa -from northern Morocco to Tripolitania- had a population of more than 3 million inhabitants in the third century, according to historian Hilario Gomez,Hilario Gomez: Ciudades del Africa bizantina (in Spanish) and nearly 40% were living in more than 500 cities. But in the sixth century -after the Byzantine reconquest- the population was reduced to less than 2.5 millions and after the Arab conquest in the eighth to tenth centuries there remained only one million (nearly all living in the countryside, with the Arab newly founded capital Kairouan having just 30,000 inhabitants). Roman northwestern Africa with its cities and civilization had practically disappeared in just two centuries of Arab domination. Different kinds of colonies Roman coloniae were of two kinds, Roman and Latin:Lendering, Jona. Coloniae. section: Roman Coloniae-Latin Coloniae the first and most important were the Roman Coloniae that characterized by full rights of Roman citizenship. Then there were the \\"Municipia\\" and finally the \\"Civitates peregrinae\\" (meaning foreign cities or not Roman populated cities). Romans called \\"municipia\\" their normal administrative entities in their empire. The citizens of municipia of the first order held full Roman citizenship and their rights (civitas optimo iure) included the right to vote, which was the ultimate right in Rome, and a sure sign of full rights. In many case these cities had reduced or even no tax duties. The second order of municipia comprised important tribal centres which had come under Roman control. Residents of these did not become full Roman citizens (although their magistrates could become so after retirement). They were given the duties of full citizens in terms of liability to taxes and military service, but not all of the rights: most significantly, they had no right to vote. List of the main Roman Coloniae There were 20 cities in the territory of actual Tunisia with the title and privileges of \\"Roman Coloniae\\" or similar, while in Algeria there was nearly the same amount and in Morocco and Libya only a few. The most important was the \\"capital\\" new Carthago, with more than 300,000 inhabitants during Septimius Severus times (who enhanced Leptis Magna -where he was born- to be the second city of Berber Africa with nearly 100,000 inhabitants). According to historian De Ruggiero in his famous \\"Dizionario epigrafico di antichita' romane\\",De Ruggiero, Ettore. Dizionario epigrafico di antichita romane Vol. I section: \\"Colonie Romane\\" the \\"Roman Coloniae\\" in Berber Africa verified academically were: *in Africa Proconsularis: Assuras, Carpis, Carthago, Curubis, Neapolis, Simithu, Thuburnica, Madaure, Thubursicum Numidiae and Zama *in Numidia: Cirta, Arsacal, Rusicae, Sigus, Tiddis, Verecunda, Cuicul, Masculla, Thamugadi and Theveste *in Mauretania Caesariensis: Caesarea, Cartenna, Oppidum Novum and Rusguniae *in Mauretania Tingitana: Volubilis, Lixus, Tingis, Banasa, Babba and Zilil *in Mauretania Sitifensis: Auzia and Sitifis *in Tripolitania: Leptis Magna Following is a list of 10 of the main and most important \\"Roman Coloniae\\": *Caesarea (Chercell in Algeria): Caesarea was made capital of Mauretania Caesariensis, when promoted to \\"Colonia Claudia Caesarea\\" in 48 AD by Claudius *Carthago (Cartage in ancient Tunisia): On the soil of destroyed Carthage, Roman Carthage was founded as \\"Colonia Junona\\" in 122 BC and refounded by Caesar in 45 BC. It was the \\"capital\\" of Roman Africa, with more than 300,000 inhabitants, and was fully destroyed by Arabs in 698 AD (who later founded nearby actual \\"Tunis\\") *Cirta (Constantine in Algeria): Cirta was renamed by Costantine I: \\"Civitas Constantina Cirtensium\\". It was surrounded by a \\"Confederation of free Roman cities\\" (Tiddis, Cuicul, etc.) *Hadrumetum (Sousa in Tunisia): Hadrumetum was made by Trajan \\"Colonia Concordia Ulpia Trajana Augusta Frugifera Hadrumetina\\" and was the second biggest city in Berber Africa. It was destroyed -after a two-month siege- by Arabs and only one century later recreated as \\"Sousse\\". *Hippo Regius (Bone in Algeria): Hyppo Regius -called even Hippona- was the city of St' Augustine. It was very rich and fully Romanized. It was destroyed by Arabs who rebuilt nearby the actual city of \\"Bone\\" in the eighth century *Leptis Magna (Leptis Magna in Roman Libya): Leptis magna was made Municipia by Trajan in 109 AD with the name \\"Ulpia Trajana\\" and Colonia by Septimius Severus in 200 AD *Sala Colonia (Chellah in Morocco): Sala Colonia was a Roman colony until the end of the third century. The city remained with a Roman garrison until the sixth century and now is part of metropolitan Rabat *Thamugadi (Timgad in Algeria): Timgad was founded by Trajan in 100 AD as \\"Colonia Marciana Ulpia Traiana Thamugadi\\" *Thysdrus (El Djem in Tunisia): Thysdrus was made \\"colonia\\" in 244 AD by Gordian III *Volubilis (Volubilis in ancient Morocco): Volubilis was made Colonia (\\"Municipium\\") by Claudius around 50 AD.

The development of the polymers is potentially a treatment for bacterial diseases. The research takes a novel approach to combating bacteria; rather than poisoning them as antibiotics do, SNAPPs and other antimicrobial peptides tear the bacteria apart.  Structure and characteristics  The molecule destabilizes the structure of the outer membrane and cytoplasmic membrane in multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacteria with no resistance observed by the researchers through multiple bacterial generations. While no human trials have been approved yet, the molecule has been tested in vivo with the mouse peritonitis model, and was shown to be highly selective towards bacterial cell walls, leaving mammalian cells unharmed. Bacteria species tested include E. coli and K. pneumoniae, along with variants of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. SNAPPs work by literally tearing the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane apart, leading to cell death. Their structure physically resembles a star. At the core of their structure is a multi-functional initiator poly(amidoamine) with 16 or 32 primary amines. Lysine and valine amino acids are polymerized to the N-terminus of the core in order to form either an S16 (16 arm SNAPP) or S32 (32 arm SNAPP). The polymerized peptide chains result in several positively charged primary ammonium cations, which help adhere the negatively charged end of the phospholipid bi-layer.

Among those present were Nikolai Ryzhkov, Anatoly Lukyanov, Boris Yeltsin, and Gavriil Popov. At the chimes of the Kremlin Clock, Gorbachev gave an address to the nation. It would be the second and last time a Soviet leader made an address on Lenin's Mausoleum during an October Revolution Day parade. It is the only Soviet parade when the inspection of troops are held after the President's speech and anthem, in contrast to the previous parades which the inspection of troops begin, followed by speech by the parade inspector and anthem, besides one of the few parades when the emblems of the Soviet Republics are not in display on the Red Square other than the 1990 Victory Day Parade, most possibly due to independence of Lithuania and Latvia (including Estonia although independence yet to be declared, but had changed its emblem, flag and official name to Republic of Estonia). After the anthem was played, the commander of the parade Colonel General Nikolai Kalinin reported to the parade inspector Marshal of the Soviet Union Dmitry Yazov. The parade of 1990 was the last military parade to feature military equipment, a sight that would not be seen until the 2008 Moscow Victory Day Parade 18 years later. Providing the music for the parade was the Massed Bands of the Moscow Military District, led by the director of the Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, Major General Nikolai Mikhailov.

For the first time in Soviet history, the traditional 7 November parade in Kiev, the capital city of the Ukrainian SSR, was the only event held on the holiday, with the parade location in Kiev was changed from Khreshchatyk Street to Victory Square (Ploshcha Peremohy) by order of the Kiev City Council. It was also limited to a one-hour parade from 9 to 10 am. No full-size tanks were displayed at the parade.

It was built in 1718 and finished in 1719. It was the second almshouse built using a bequest from Stephen Skiddy for the city's poor, either Catholic or Church of Ireland. The first building, located near North Gate Bridge, was replaced by the end of 1718 following complaints of its being a poor source for fresh air and being too narrow. Skiddy left an annual payment for his Almshouse to be made in his will in 1584. This annual payment began when Skiddy's wife died in 1606. The payment is made to this day by The Vintners Federation in London to Skiddy's charity. The Almshouse was also funded by Roger Bettridge when he wrote it in his will in 1717. The Almshouse was built on a corner of the medieval Saint Mary's Churchyard, the building was once part of a campus including the Green Coat Hospital and School. The other buildings were demolished in the 1950s. The Almshouse was saved from demolition by the Cork Preservation Society in the 1960s with an award-winning restoration completed in 1975 by the architect Frank Murphy. In 2000, the CPS Sold the Almshouse to the Social Housing Development Company. This restoration, which saw Murphy (as architect) win an RIAI Europa Nostra award, was followed by a second restoration which completed in 2005. Skiddy's Almshouse is now one of the very few surviving eighteenth-century institutional buildings in Cork. The Almshouse is an L-shaped building with a stone arcade enclosed by a ten-foot wall and a large iron gate. As of 2011, it housed 15 people.

Dr Johann van der Mark from the Mathematics Division, National Physics Research Laboratory, Institute of Physics of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in Pretoria, was a key figure in setting up and launching the South African Mathematical Association. The first Chairman of the Council of the Association, for the period 1957‚Äì1958, was James M. Hyslop (University of the Witwatersrand). The SAMS was one of the groups involved in launching, in 1992‚Äì1993 the new Association for Mathematics Education of South Africa (AMESA),History of AMESA, Association for Mathematics Education of South Africa.

SAMS and apartheid From the moment the SAMS was launched in 1957, its Constitution, membership, election and office-holder rules were non-discriminatory and did not contain any racially restrictive language. In August 1962 the SAMS Council decided that, notwithstanding the apartheid laws and social expectations in the country, the SAMS would not form separate branches of the SAMS for non-white members.P. Maritz, The South African Mathematical Society 1957 ‚Äì 2007Section H: Delicate Issues. South African Mathematical Society. Accessed October 23, 2016 Nevertheless, until the early 1990s, the SAMS had only a few non-white members; thus the Society had two black members in 1977 and four in 1980. During the apartheid era, the SAMS continued to experience difficulties it terms of its international recognition and international activities because of the general international human rights, protest and boycott movements directed against the South African regime. Thus the American Mathematical Society originally established a reciprocity agreement with the SAMS in 1972, after an investigation by the AMS showed that the membership rules for admittance to the SAMS were non-discriminatory. However, after protests by civil rights activists, the AMS cancelled the reciprocity agreement in 1974.Everett Pitcher, A history of the second fifty years, American Mathematical Society 1939‚Äì88, American Mathematical Society, 1988, ; p. 156Charlene Morrow, Teri Perl, Notable Women in Mathematics: A Biographical Dictionary, Greenwood Press, 1998, ; p. 73 The AMS restored its reciprocity agreement with the SAMS in 1994, after the fall of the apartheid.Bettye Anne Case, A Century of Mathematical Meetings, American Mathematical Society, 1995, ; p 90 The SAMS annual Distinguished Visitor program experienced a high rate of declined invitations and postponed visits due to concerns of the international mathematical community about the apartheid. One of the most publicized visits under the program was that of Peter Hilton, who was the SAMS Distinguished Visitor for 1981. Hilton published a letter in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society, prior to his visit, explaining the conditions on which he accepted the visit and later published an account of his visit.Peter Hilton, Reflections on a visit to South Africa, Focus, vol. 1, no. 4, Nov. ‚Äì Dec 1981.

Cream of black mint has a green color, thick texture, and pleasant taste. Its preparation is easy, and the time you need to make it is quick. Gastronomic context The cream is prepared with Huacatay leaves, an herb native to the Andes, which is found growing wild in many fields and small farms; its cultivation is not official, because it is self-propagating and used by the locals in their condiments. It is similar to the Paico herb, which is also edible, and is used in a soup called \\"Sopa de Paico\\" (Paico soup). The herb Huacatay is a green plant and has a pleasant smell. In Peru and other Latin American countries, the Huacatay leaves are crushed using a fulling mill, a tool of stone that serves as a traditional blender that substitutes for this device. In effect, this achieves a less fine ground, but allows greater absorption of flavor. Huacatay cream sauce is traditionally used in the preparation of chicken parties or barbecues.

She worked for various organizations, such as the U.S. Geological Survey and the Cushman Laboratory for Foraminiferal Research in Sharon, Massachusetts.  Early life  Todd was born on October 22, 1913, in Seattle, Washington, the eldest of five children of John Nelson and Margaret Fordyce Todd. The family lived on Mercer Island in Lake Washington until 1925, when her father moved them to Gering Valley in Nebraska, to help run her grandfather's farm. Todd had kept a journal that documented her times living and helping on the farm. Upon the latter's death in 1928, the family returned to Mercer Island. Todd's initial infatuation with geology led her to create somewhat of a makeshift laboratory in her basement.  Education  Todd received her B.Sc. in 1936, then her M.Sc. in 1939 from the University of Washington. She became a teaching fellow at Mount Holyoke College but wanted to expand her research and education. She add applied for various positions, handing in countless resumes and letters which had gone un-noticed. It was then that she decided to contact Joseph A. Cushman who took her on as an assistant. With Dr. Cushman, Todd was able to publish multiple papers with her as the junior author which served to make her more known in the geological community. Apart from helping tremendously with research as well as advancing her techniques, she took notes on Dr. Cushman that would later be used in his biography. After Dr. Cushman's death in 1949, she decided to join the U.S. Geological Survey to expand her research. It was quite efficient for Todd to work as part of the U.S. Geological Survey as she lived relatively close to their Marine Geology branch. This enabled Todd to store many of her research pieces in her house and once again her home turned into a laboratory.  Career  As part of the U.S. Geological Survey, Todd was able to advance her research into the fields of ecology-paleoecology and stratigraphy. She became one of seven trustees--as well as secretary-treasurer--for the Cushman Foundation for Foraminiferal Research, which was created in 1950. In 1955 Todd was elected a fellow of the Geological Society of America, as well as a fellow of the Cushman Foundation. However, it wasn't until 1980 that her scientific contributions were undeniably noted, when she received the first Joseph A. Cushman Award for Foraminiferal Research. Another notable moment for Todd occurred in 1959 when she shared, with Paul Blackmon, the Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists Best Paper Award in the Journal of Paleontology. The paper became well noted for the mineralogy of foraminiferan tests. Much of Todd's research was focused on fauna fossils from islands such as Yap, Saipan, Guam, Fiji, and so on. Many of the fossils that she focused on were relatively unknown and untouched by plenty of other researchers. It was Preston E. Cloud, Jr. who guided Todd in her research with the U.S. Geological Survey and who pushed her to expand her knowledge to encompass fields of stratigraphy and paleoecology. During, and once retired from her research Todd enjoyed giving back to the community. She did so by giving short talks to both science teachers and science classes in the Martha's Vineyard Regional Highschool. Todd also allocated a notable amount of her time to discussions with past colleagues, discussing much of her research from all over the globe.  Retirement and death  Todd retired from the U.S. Geological Survey in 1974 but continued to spend her time in the library of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, preparing lists of current publications and writing thoughtful annotations in the Journal of Farminiferal Research. On August 19, 1984, she died of a heart attack on the island of Martha‚Äôs Vineyard, where she had lived and worked for the last ten years after retiring.

A stamp in honor of the parade. Vehicles on parade. The 1941 October Revolution Parade of November 7, 1941 was a parade in honor of the October Revolution 24 years earlier.Russia and later the Soviet Union adopted the Gregorian calendar after the October Revolution, so that the anniversary now fell on 7 November. It is most famous for taking place during the Battle of Moscow. The General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Joseph Stalin delivered a speech to the soldiers on the parade on Red Square who would go to battle immediately after the parade. Many of the soldiers on the parade would be killed in battle. Every year in modern Russia November 7th is a holiday in honor of the 1941 parade as a substitute for celebration of the October Revolution, as a Day of Military Honour. Parades held on that year that are more memorable are the parades in Moscow's Red Square and in Kuybyshev Square, Samara (formerly Kuybyshev in the Soviet period). Both are marked today by commemorative parades to honor their historic importance.  Order of the Moscow parade marchpast  The parade was inspected by the commander of the Reserve Front, Marshal of the Soviet Union Semyon Budyonny, with musical accompaniment by a combined band made up of the Central Military Band of the People's Commissariat of Defence, the Band of the Dzerzhinsky Division, and the Staff Band of the Moscow Military District, both under the baton of Colonel Vasily Agapkin, then the Director of Music, Staff Band of the MMD.  Ground column  Following Colonel General Pavel Artemyev riding on horseback, the parade marched past in the following order:http://encyclopedia.mil.ru/encyclopedia/history/more.htm?id=10769032@cmsArticle * Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College * Moscow Artillery School * Combined Regiment from the 336th Naval Infantry Brigade and Navy Headquarters Detachment Moscow (1st Naval Task Group) * 332nd Rifle Division * ODON * NKVD Internal Troops stationed in Moscow * 2nd Rifle (People's Militia) Division * Regiment from the Military Council of the Moscow Military District * Vsevobuch Regiment (two battalions) * Veteran Red Guards battalion  Stalin's Speech  Video of Stalin's speech to the Red Army.

Before the parade commenced the then General Secretary of the All- Union Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and Premier of the USSR Joseph Stalin delivered this historic address to the nation:  Parade in Kuybyshev  The parade in Kuybyshev Square, Samara The other national parade held was at Kuybyshev (today Samara), at the grounds of Kuybyshev Square, attended by officials of the All-Union Communist Party, the Council of People's Commissars and the Supreme Soviet, high-ranking officers of the Soviet Armed Forces and the diplomatic corps, on the grounds of the city being a wartime national capital in the case of Moscow having fallen into Axis hands. The parade commander was then Lieutenant General Maksim Purkayev, commanding general of the 60th Army, while it was inspected by the former People's Commissar of Defense Marshal Kliment Voroshilov, who later gave the national holiday message following the inspection. It was his final inspection of an October Revolution parade and the only one he inspected outside the capital. An estimated 15,000 military servicemen took part, alongside more than 140 military vehicles and equipment and 217 aircraft, followed by a civilian demonstration of citizens from the city as well as refugees from the western cities. A 360-man massed bands contingent of the Volga Military District provided the ceremonial music.

The rostrum was filled with the leaders of regional party organizations, among other guests such as Polish writer Wanda Wasilewska, the Ukrainian literary figure Oleksandr Korniychuk and future Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. At 11:30 am, to the sounds of a 300-member military band led by the famous Voronezh composer Konstantin Massalitinov, the parade of the Voronezh Garrison began. Tanks marched in white camouflage to the sound of the Cavalry Lynx by Semyon Tchernetsky. The parade lasted no more than an hour and a half. After the war, the parade took a backseat in historical importance.https://en.riavrn.ru/news/rekonstruktsiya-voronezhskogo- parada-1941-goda-sobrala-bolee-500-chelovek/  Full order of the Voronezh parade  * Massed Bands * Personnel of the 327th Rifle Division ** Infantry ** Artillery ** Mechanized columns *** BA-64 *** ZIS-5 *** M-72 *** GAZ-67 *** Willys MB *** Katyusha rocket launcher  Legacy of the parades of 1941  Today the legacy of the twin parades held during the first year of the Great Patriotic War in the cities of Moscow and Samara are a reminder of the resistance of the Russian people and her armed forces, as part of the wider Soviet Union, against the aggresion brought upon by Nazi Germany in the Eastern Front of the Second World War. Millions of Russians who live in the wider areas of these two cities have or had family members and relatives who marched in these parades and/or fought during the conflict and consider these parades part of the wider history of Russia and of their families. Thus, the anniversaries of the parades of 1941 are for many Russians held in high esteem as a show of force against the fascist enemy and of Russia's determination to defeat any form of international aggression as well as for the country to show to her people and the young the values of patriotism, remembrance of the fallen, love of country and service in the armed forces. Every 7 November, the two cities hold commemorative parades not just to remember the hundreds of thousands of their residents who fought and died in the Second World War but to forever maintain the memories that this two parades had on their cities' long history.  Military memorial parade in Moscow's Red Square  The more memorable and famous 1941 parade on Moscow's Red Square has since the late 1990s been marked by commemorative parades by personnel of the Moscow Garrison, cadets of armed forces academies, servicemen of military units, the Young Army Cadets National Movement, cadets of military cadet schools and young men and women under youth uniformed and volunteer organizations within the capital city and its environs, with over 5,800 taking part.https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Travel/wireStory/russia-enacts-legendary- world-war-ii-parade-moscow-66816886 The march of veterans of the 1941 parade was first held in Russia in 2000. In 2003, the City of Moscow organized a procession of youth organization. Two years later, the anniversary of the parade was marked with a demonstration of wartime equipment and vehicles. A nationally televised event, it is attended by the living veterans of the war, families of deceased servicemen and veterans, the diplomatic corps, cadets of the armed forces and veterans of recent conflicts, with the Mayor of Moscow as the guest of honor. The parade commander, since 2014, has been a Colonel in active service of the armed forces. The ceremonial music for the parade is provided by the massed military bands of the Moscow Capital Garrison, under the baton of the Senior Director of Music of the Military Band Service. Since 2015, the parade begins with the march on in slow time of the Flag of Russia and the Victory Banner, imitating that of the Victory Day Parade earlier in the year. The 2012 parade was also marked as the final event concluding a year of celebrations of the biccentennial jubilee of the French invasion of Russia and the historic Battle of Borodino. Following the order to commence the march past in quick time, the order of the parade is as follows: * Massed Bands of the Moscow Garrison **Band of the 154th Preobrazhensky Regiment, ** Band of the Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation ** Band of the Military University of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation ** Band of the Moscow Higher Combined Arms Command School ** Band of the 147th Automobile Base ** Band of the 27th Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade ** Band of the 1st Semyonovsky Independent Rifle Regiment * Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College *154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment Colour Guard * Combined color guard and color guard of front standards * 1st Honour Guard Company of the 3rd Honor Guard Battalion, 154th PICR * Historical battalion made up of: **Military University of the Ministry of Defense **Moscow Higher Military Command School **27th Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade **Gagarin-Zhukovsky Air Force Academy **Peter the Great Military Academy of the Strategic Missile Forces **Engineering Forces, Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Defence and Control Military Academy \\"Marshal of the Soviet Union Semyon Timoshenko\\" **Separate Operational Purpose Division, National Guard Forces Command * Suvorov Military School * Moscow National Guard Presidential Cadet School * Moscow Cadet Corps of the Investigative Committee of Russia * Moscow Cadet Fire Corps of the Civil Defense Academy, Ministry of Emergency Situations * Moscow Young Army Patriotic Cadets Unit (on behalf of the Young Army Cadets National Movement) * Moscow University of Maritime Transportation * Moscow Unit of the Labor Reserves All-Russia Volunteer Sports Association * Composite battalion of Moscow units of DOSAAF * Combined cadet regiment of Moscow area cadet schools and courses ** Moscow National Pensions School Cadet Corps ** 1st Moscow Cadet Corps **Boarding School for Girls of the Ministry of Defense of Russia ** Moscow Sea Cadet Corps of the Navigation and Mathematics School ** Moscow Sea Cadet Corps \\"Heroes of Sevastopol\\" ** Moscow Cadet Corps \\"Heroes of Stalingrad\\" ** Moscow Cadet Corps \\"Space Heroes\\" ** Moscow Military Music Cadet Corps ** Moscow 1st Cadet Corps of the Border Service of the Federal Security Service ** Moscow Justice Cadet Corps ** Moscow Diplomatic Cadet Corps ** Moscow Cossack Cadets ** Preobrazhensky Cadet Corps ** Petrovsky Cadet Corps ** St. George Cadet Corps ** Moscow Chemical Cadet Corps ** Tagansky Cadet Corps ** Moscow Police Cadet Corps  Civil-military memorial parade in Kuybyshev Square, Samara  The Samara parade of 1941 has been remembered more recently beginning in 2011 as the city government hosts a large civil-military parade at Kuybyshev Square in the city proper to honor the thousands who marched before state, political and military leaders on that square in the winter of 1941. Also a televised event, the Mayor of Samara is the parade's guest of honor, reviewing more than 10,000 marchers from the armed forces, civil services, veterans and students of cadet schools in Samara and neighbouring regions of the country, making it far bigger than the Moscow parade. Beginning 2014 the parade has also included a civil march of students, professionals, athletes and distinguished citizens in memory of the civilian marchers of the memorable 1941 parade. Since the city was the wartime capital of the Soviet Union in case of the Axis capture of Moscow, the Samara parade is a chance for the people of the city to recall one of the more famous chapters of its long history. Since its commencement in 2011, it has adopted the march on in slow time of the Moscow parade, and beginning from the parade of 2017 the city garrison's massed bands play The Internationale as the colour guard including the naval ensign of the Amur Military Flotilla and the flags of the two divisions which took part in the parade marches into the square to take its place of honor in the formation.

Cemetery About 5,000 Huguenots came to Ireland during the time when they were fleeing religious persecution, following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in their native France. Hundreds of these refugees settled in Cork. In the area of Lumley Street, now known as French Church Street, they built a school, an almshouse and a graveyard.

The last recorded use of the graveyard for burial was in 1901. The cemetery is a recorded monument.

They became one of the most popular bands in Concord and the Charlotte area during the mid-1960s and enjoyed a regional hit with their single, \\"Wild Man\\" backed with \\"Stop, Look, Listen\\" recorded at Arthur Smith's studio in Charlotte and released on his Pyramid label. They broke up in 1968. In the intervening years their work has become highly regarded by garage rock enthusiasts and has appeared on several compilations. History=Origins The Tamrons were formed by several students who attended Concord High School in Concord, North Carolina in 1965. CR-0345CD - liner notes They were originally known as the Night Raiders. Initially their lineup consisted of Lloyd Pettus on lead guitar, Robert Walters on rhythm guitar, and Ted Pettus on drums. Keith Stacy, previously a guitarist in another local band, the Kings, joined on bass. According to Stacey, \\"They played against The Kings at a talent show and asked me if I could play bass, so I bought a bass guitar and joined The Night Raiders\\". Robert Walters‚Äô brother, Phil Walters, joined on keyboards and played a Farfisa organ. Shortly thereafter, the Nightriders changed their name to the Tamrons at the suggestion of guitarist Lloyd Pettus. The Tamrons were influenced by the Beatles and the groups of the British Invasion, as well as American bands such as Paul Revere & the Raiders and the Byrds, whose song \\"It Won't be Wrong\\" was a regular fixture in the Tamrons' repertoire. Concord had an active garage band scene, with groups such as the Huns, the Fantastik Four, the Phantom Raiders, the West Wind, the Swinging Sensations, the Surfmates, the West Wind, and the Ravens, whose membership included Keith Stacey's brother Don Stacey. The Tamrons also played regularly in Charlotte, which was the home of the Paragons and the Grifs. The Tamrons participated in several battle of the bands contests, such as at the Concord Recreation Center in 1967, and eventually toured in a wide area covering over a 200-mile radius. Initially, Robert Walters' father, Earl Walters, was the band's manager, but eventually Lloyd Pettus' father took over. According to Stacey: :He [Mr. Pettus] a bought us a trailer and had it painted; it was pretty cool for those days. I remember Mr. Walters taking us to Wilmington to play the telethon. We stopped off at a church and played, and while we were playing Mr. Walters talked the local police into coming in and shutting us down because we were too loud. We were stunned...He came out laughing at us, and the cops said crank it up. He was a funny guy. Initially the Tamrons played at several gas station openings in downtown Concord, sometimes on the back of a flatbed trailer, and some of the performances were broadcast on live radio. They regularly played at the Green Dragon, a popular teen club in Concord. Rivalry with the Huns and recording The Tamrons and the Huns became the two most popular bands in Concord. Both were at first on friendly terms, but would later become bitter rivals. Several members of the Huns attended a Tamrons rehearsal at Lloyd Pettus' house and heard them perform their self- penned song \\"Genie\\". The Huns quickly went to the studio and recorded an almost identical song called \\"Shakedown\\" (later issued on the Back from the Grave, Volume 2 compilation. When the Tamrons heard the record, they became furious. According to Stacey: :We were furious! We went as a mob to Dean Coley‚Äôs house (their bass player). His father was their manager, so we stood out in the street and tried to get them to come out and fight. I can't tell you how mad that made us. The Tamrons went to Arthur Smith's studio in Charlotte (where James Brown recorded \\"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\\") to record their single for Smith's label, Pyramid Records, showcasing two songs written Pettus and Walters. The A-side featured the highly primitive and sexually- charged \\"Wild Man\\", which began with a Twilight Zone style guitar riff. The B-side was \\"Stop, Look, Listen\\", more melodic mid-tempo ballad. Though his contributions were barely audible in the mixes, keyboardist Steve Baucom was brought in to play organ and sang backup for both songs during the session. The single became a local and regional hit in the Concord/Charlotte area. The group continued playing and performing for the next couple of years, but went through lineup and stylistic changes. Rober Walters departed to concentrate on playing football and was replaced on guitar by Bobby Yost from Kannappolis, North Carolina. In 1968 the group decided to move in a soul and R&B; direction and added a horn section consisting of Eddie Coble on saxophone, as well as John Sherril and Rick Nash on trumpets. Later that year the Tamrons broke up. Later developments and legacy Under the influence of Jimi Hendrix, Keith Stacy got together with Butch Yarborough, previously of the Fantastik Four, and formed a heavy rock group called Liquid Nitrogen. Stacy later played in groups such as Flight, Axis, and more recently Jesse Bolt. Robert Walters went on to play professional football with the Washington Redskins. In the intervening years, the Tamrons' music has come to the attention of garage rock enthusiasts. In the list of the top 1000 garage rock recordings voted on by a panel of garage rock writers and experts appearing in Mike Markesich's Teenbeat Mayhem (the book includes over 16, 000 records), the Tamrons' song, \\"Wild Man\\", was ranked at #147, placing it in the top 200 garage rock songs of all time. Their work has appeared in several Compilations. \\"Wild Man is included on the Back from the Grave, Volume 2 CD and Back from the Grave, Volume 4 LP issued by Crypt Records. \\"Stop, Look, Listen\\" appears on the Total Ranch: 100% Boss Garage compilation put out by Manic Mustang Records. Summing up his experience with the Tamrons, Keith Stacey recalls: :Those days were magical. Everybody played in a band. Those guys are now lawyers and airline pilots, but then you had to be in a band in Concord.

It was built by early pioneer and farmer Michael Schenck (1772‚Äì1844) and his son Samuel Schenck (November 17, 1793 ‚Äì December 1, 1872) out of locally quarried limestone, where many fossils can be seen on the eastern side of the facade. The Schenck family dates back to 1709 when they first arrived in America in an effort to escape religious persecution for being Anabaptist, specifically Mennonite. Just over a hundred years later they would find themselves in two covered wagons, traversing the Allegheny Mountains, and settling at the border between the City of Buffalo and Town of Amherst. There they practiced the same farming techniques they had in Pennsylvania and earlier in Germany. These techniques by today‚Äôs standards could be termed \\"environmentally friendly\\" and polyculture due to their use of crop rotation, production of multiple food products on a family farm, and the use of cow manure. The Schencks like other German settlers practiced the keeping and feeding of multiple types of animals, housing them in a barn through winter. This practice was considered unusual by farmers of British heritage. While the German idea of feeding and housing animals through winter was adopted by non-German farmers in the 19th century, the keeping of a variety of animals was not. Many 19th-century farmers began to develop specialized farms, unofficially becoming a \\"pig farmer\\" or \\"cattle rancher\\". Three generations of Schencks continued practicing polyculture of crops and animals even when monoculture continued to expand and ‚Äúspecial‚Äù or synthetic fertilizers were being developed and used. The property was originally part of the Hamlet of Snyder, in the Town of Amherst and continued to be when the family sold it to the Country Club of Buffalo in 1898. The Country Club kept the original buildings except for a cottage ‚Äì northwest of the main stone house ‚Äì where Samuel Schenck‚Äôs mother Catherine Schenck lived.1855 Map of Erie County New York, from actual Survey, Amherst, lots 37 & 58, label ‚ÄúMrs. Shenk‚Äù and ‚ÄúS.

The golf course was completed in 1902. The property was rezoned in the 1920s when it was sold to the City of Buffalo. It became a public park and golf course called Grover Cleveland Golf Course. It was transferred again in the 1970s, this time to Erie County; however, the property remained within the city limits. Around 1970, the large barn and significantly smaller structure were demolished. The Schenck house currently has three of the original six buildings and roughly 180 acres of the original acres surviving to 2016. The 2003 Master Plan developed by Erie County has stated that it is looking at filing for preservation status. The three remaining buildings, in addition to census, church and other records, show that the architecture, farming techniques and religious preferences of the Schencks were of a distinctly Pennsylvania German-Swiss (also called Pennsylvanian Dutch) heritage and culture. They were part of a wave of immigrants that arrived in the Niagara County (later divided into Niagara & Erie County) during the pre-civil war era. Many of the immigrants from Pennsylvania did not live in isolated communities and instead built homes and lived among people from a variety of places of origin.1850 United States Federal Population Census, Amherst New York, general population data The Friends of Schenck House work with and support Erie County and the 2003 Master Plan to restore the second oldest building in the City of Buffalo. \\"Another notable ‚Äúheritage‚Äù aspect of the Grover Cleveland Golf Course is that the site has one of the oldest stone buildings in Erie County on it, possibly dating back as early as the 1810s.

Note the severe angles at either end and the curved center, characteristics of the large Conestoga compared to other varieties of covered wagon. Samuel Schenck was 28 years old when he emigrated with his parents Michael and Catherine Schenck in two covered wagons from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to the Buffalo, New York, area in 1821. It is likely he emigrated with his first wife Sarah Hoopart Schenck (July 23, 1798 to March 14, 1823) and at least one of his two sons‚ÄîJacob and John‚Äîbased on birth and death recorded on their gravestones. The Schencks were from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The Conestoga wagon was a water tight overland vehicle that was designed to cross both rough road and float across rivers. This design is useful for cross the mountains and rivers that would have been barriers on the road from Lancaster and Pittsburgh, PA to Buffalo and Amherst, NY in the 1820s.http://purple.niagara.edu/library/buffhist/1-709-724.pdf, page 714 under Jacob Schenck brother of Samuel Schenck ‚ÄúMichael Schenck emigrated from Pennsylvania in August 1821 with his family in two large covered wagons, drawn by four horses, came by way of Pittsburgh, over the mountain to Erie, thence to a point then called Comstock‚Äôs, eight miles from Buffalo, where he was compelled to place eight horses to one wagon, in order to get to Buffalo, on account of bad roads, he settled in Amherst, and purchased one-half section of land at fifteen dollars per acre, near Snyder post-office, then heavy timber land.‚Äù http://purple.niagara.edu/library/buffhist/1-709-724.pdf Brief Personals - Jacob Schenck, Michael Schenck 1827 map showing the overland routes to Buffalo and Amherst, NY, The Schencks took a route from Pittsburgh to Erie, PA then following the road along the water front that is roughly where Route 5 is today - by Carey & Lea, New York State - Buffalo at this time is spelled \\"Buffaloe\\". \\"Geographical, Statistical, and Historical Map of New York\\", 1827 Timothy Dwight - a traveler in 1804 states the following, \\"The only villages, which it contains, are Batavia and 'Buffaloe' creek...

Buffalo creek, otherwise called New Amsterdam, is built on the North- Eastern border of a considerable mill-stream, which bears the same name...

Since that period it has been re-built, and is now a beautiful and flouring town of one hundred and fifty houses - PUB 1820. Beyond this hamlet a handsome point stretches to the South- west; and furnished an imperfect shelter to the vessels, employed in the commerce of the lake. Seven of the vessels, (five schooners, a sloop and a pettiaugre) lay in the harbor at this time.\\" :New England and New York 1822 page 66 The Schencks arrived on the cusp of a migration of British, European and American settlers into the ‚ÄúGreater Buffalo Region\\" in Western New York. City of Buffalo saw its non-indigenous population increase from 2,095 in the year 1820 to 42,470 in 1850. The Town of Amherst saw a similar rate of increase from 262 in 1820 to 4,453 in 1850.1820 United States Federal Population Census, Amherst New York, general population data1820 United States Federal Population Census, Buffalo New York, general population data1850 United States Federal Population Census, Buffalo New York, general population data More specifically, the Schencks were part of a migration of German-Swiss Pennsylvanians along with people newly emigrated from Germany between the 1820s to the 1850s into the Town of Amherst and City of Buffalo. The Town of Amherst had 1,556 German and 364 Pennsylvanians arrive by the year 1850, or 43% of the total population. The City of Buffalo had 9,409 Germans, 69 Prussians and 376 Pennsylvanians by 1850, or 23% of the population. Each Federal census cycle the Schencks had male and female farmhands or laborers who were born in Germany listed as living in their household. Due to this, it is possible that the Schencks were bilingual. Architecture The house has had some alteration over its history, most of which was in the 19th century and included a front porch and two-story rear addition. The construction of the Schenck House was likely started in June 1822, when Michael Schenck purchased the property for $1000, and completed in August 1823, when Michael sold it to his eldest son Samuel Schenck for $3500. The Schenck House was built with a ‚ÄúContinental Pennsylvania German House‚Äù (CPGH) floor plan of three rooms over three rooms, without a Federal style ‚Äúcentral entrance hall‚Äù, plus additional windows set into the third floor for functional light. Traditionally, this style would include a central chimney on a stone or brick central support wall. Further investigation is needed to determine if the two interior chimneys at either end of the house were original to the house. The Continental Pennsylvania German House plan was brought over to America with immigrants in the 17th and 18th century and dates to the Middle Ages in Central Europe. A comparable extant house is the -story Immel House in the State of Pennsylvania; three interior rooms over three, three exterior bays by two deep, with a central chimney and additional windows set into the gable end of the half story. Samuel Schenck 1823 House - made with local Limestone and off-centered front door The exterior of the Schenck house is in the ‚ÄúPennsylvania German Traditional‚Äù (PGT) style pre-1830s due to the asymmetry of the front door. It is noted that the ‚Äúfour over four‚Äù [four exterior bays over four] was first used with an asymmetrical front entrance as is the Schenck House, and then by the 1830s either PGT symmetrical (two matching doors) front entrance or English Federal style single door central bay front entrance. The Green House is an example of Vernacular style. Cooking in an 1823 house would have involved using the fireplace and in the case of the Schencks a 10 plate stove and pipe. A \\"5 plate stove\\" or German Jamb stove was a cast-iron free-standing stove developed in German speaking regions in the 1550s A.D.. However, it was used for heating the sleeping and sitting areas of the first floor of the house. The kitchen was heated by the kitchen fireplace. Once in America German immigrants developed a 6 plate Six Plate stove (history) or closed stove which was cooked on by the 1740s. Benjamin Franklin is also an inventor of a coal burning stove in 1741, Franklin stove. However, it was not free-standing and was inserted into the fireplace. Items found in Michael Schenck's 1844 inventory that relate to food preparation included the following: One ten plate stove & Pipe, 1 kitchen cupboard & crockery, 1 table, settee (possibly Pennsylvanian German style), elbow chair, Ironware and hooks. The inventory is short and lacks all personal items. The inventory includes both a ten-plate stove which would allow enough space for two pots and a small oven. However, it also included ironware and hooks for cooking over the fireplace. This is in comparison to Susannah Schenck Lapp who grew up in the Schenck House and then resided there with her husband John Lapp in the 1880s and 1890s. Despite many changes in technology in the 19th century, the presence of \\"a lot of chains\\" in the kitchen may relate to her either still using the fireplace for some cooking, or were for seasonal use when apple butter making in heavy kettles. The following kitchen items were inventoried at the Schenck House and probated on March 15, 1895. * 4 tables - $2.50 * 1 Iron Kettle - $1.00 * a lot of chains - $0.50 * 2 Brass Kettles - $1.00 * a lot of stone jars, jugs & Butter - $0.25 * 3 oil Cans - $0.50 * 1 Churn - $0.25 * 1 Scale and Baking Mould $0.50 * 1 Copper Kettle - $1.50 * a lot of fruit jars/jams - $0.75 * 1 sink - $0.10 * a lot of dishes, knives & forks - $0.50 * 1 Coal Stove - $2.00 * 1 Bench - $0.10 * 1 old Cupboard - $0.10 * 9 Cans Fruit - $0.45 * 6 old Bags - $0.25 * Table spread - x Outbuildings The surviving outbuildings include a red brick, two room building with a loft used either as a SpringHouse or summer kitchen. The duel interior end chimneys and proximity to the main house supports a function in conjunction with the kitchen of the main house. This is likely to be where the dairy butter, apple butter and cider were being processed. A second outbuilding in the form of a -story small barn with the roof extended to create a side stall without exterior walls was possibly either a Combination Structure or a small animal shelter where the sheep or swine were kept. The Non-population agriculture registers show the farming of swine and sheep.Non-Population Federal Census, 1850, line No. 2, name Sam SchenckNon-Population Federal Census, 1870, line No. 33, name Samuel Schenck Two other structures, the barn which had a fore structure perpendicular to the main barn and a small building between the main house and barn, can be found on a 1927 blueprint of the lot. Farming techniques and practices Samuel and his second wife Magdalena Schenck farmed the land from roughly 1823 to 1872. From 18601860 United States Federal Census, Amherst New York, page 57, line 32 and 33 to 1872, Samuel Schenck was infirmed, and described as disabled in surrogate court records, while Magdalena managed the farm and farm hands.Surrogates Court, Erie County, November 13t, 1874, Testimony by Widow Magdalena Schenck She continued the management until her death in 1887.Erie County Clerks Office, New York, Letters of Administration Vol. 009-0011, 1886-1889, Magdalena Schenck Samuel and Magdalana‚Äôs daughter Susannah Schenck Lapp and her husband John Lapp moved to the farm in the 1880s and continued to manage the farm until 1895 when Susannah, having been paralyzed from a stroke, died. Susannah‚Äôs son and daughter Barbara, having leased the fields from their parents since the 1980s, continued farming in the same fashion as their grandparents through to about 1900.1880 United States Federal Non-population census, Amherst New York, page 33, No. 5 Andrew & Ruben Lapp, rented Work was divided with the men plowing, sowing and harvesting the fields along with managing the cattle. The women managed the orchard, beekeeping and milking of the cows and produced apples, apple butter, apple cider, and dairy butter. It is unknown if it was the men or women who managed the swine and sheep.Surrogates Court, Erie County, November 13, 1874, Testimony by Widow Magdalena Schenck, loose paper-no book Census records point to Samuel Schenck utilizing traditional farming technologies that were brought over by the German and Swiss settlers, which include crop rotation, co-planting, housing and feeding cattle and animals in cold winter months, barns with stalls, large wagons for transporting hay, and the growing of hay. The non-population Federal census taken in 1850 and 1870 plus the NYS census taken in 1855 demonstrate a farming style utilizing both polyculture and crop rotation as opposed to the monoculture that was more commonly used by early English settlers. Polyculture is a modern term; however, the co-planting, and planting of multiple types of food products on the same farm has been utilized by Central Europeans since the Middle Ages.(Citation needed) The use of a polyculture system along with crop rotation allowed for higher nutrition and for the land to replace nutrients.(citation) The 1855 NYS census gives an account on how the farm land was used. The farm was divided into plowed, fallow, pasture and meadow zones. The plowed land was further divided. Products produced from seed in 1854 included; winter wheat, oats, Barley, buckwheat, corn, and Irish potatoes. The orchard produced 150 bushels of apples, and 2 barrels of cider were made. The meadow produced 10 tons of hay plus a half bushel of grass seed was harvested. Additionally, 11 acres were allowed to sit fallow - were not used, allowing weeds and grass to grow. This last point is notable because six of the Schenck‚Äôs immediate neighbors who were not of German or Pennsylvanian German heritage did not have any recorded land left to fallow. The livestock according to both the 1850 and 1870 Federal and 1855 NY State census included the production of butter and honey. For 1850, 1855 and 1870 the farm produced 150, 300 and 520 pounds of butter from 2, 3 and then 5 cows. During these years 50‚Äì75 pounds of honey were produced from beekeeping. The Schencks did not have working oxen or mules, but did have 4 horses. They also kept 4-14 swine for all three of the census years and 2 sheep. In 1850, there was an apparent attempt to grow sweet potatoes in Western NY, 4 bushels were harvested, the number of acres sown is unknown. The sweat potatoes were not grown in 1855 or 1870. In the November 13, 1874, surrogates court papers in regards to the year her husband died in 1872, Magdalena states, \\"I was managing the farm when husband [sic] died. There was a little grain raised the year he died. There was a little oats & some wheat, some straw, maybe 2 tons - there was 2 or 3 loads - there was a few apples - 10 or 15 bushels - Graag was made some cider [sic] - do[n't] know how much. Don't know how many potatoes there was but there was enough to last us though the winter 20 or 25 bushels. We had a couple 'mipes' [mingle] of Turnips & a four [bushels] cabbages,...1 bbl apple butter. There were some grain bags on the farm, 6 of them were petty good....[six] were old and poor.\\" It has been observed by early travelers how farming techniques varied from region to region. Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where Samuel Schenck was born and raised drew considerable attention, and Lancaster, PA system was recorded in detail. It is noted that the crops produced on Samuel Schenck‚Äôs farm in Snyder, New York, happen to also be mentioned to be used in rotation in Lancaster. ‚ÄúSchoeps found that ‚Äúusual practice‚Äù in Bucks County in 1783 was to plant maize the first year, wheat and English grass the second year, then to pasture for four or five years. Sometimes, he added, buckwheat or turnips were planted after wheat before the ground was allowed to lie fallow. Cazenove in his Journal gives a very complete picture of crop rotation in various parts of Pennsylvania in 1794. Around Bethlehem, wheat was sowed the first year followed by oats, corn, or buckwheat in the second year, clover the third year, and clover and plowed to sow in the fourth. ‚Ä¶ In Cumberland County, no ‚Äúconsistant [sic][or] very well thought-out‚Äù crop rotation was practiced, and the farmers ‚Äúfollowed too much their humor,‚Äù but good farmers, on good land, sowed wheat the first year, after thrice plowing the land, oats or corn the second year, and clover and fallow the third and fourth years. ‚Ä¶ A travel account of 1794, which indicated that Lancaster County was the best cultivated of any part of Pennsylvania, gave the following account of rotation there: the first crop, Indian corn, was planted in late May or early June, was harvested in the fall in time to sow the second crop, [winter] wheat. In the spring of the second year, before the wheat sowed the previous fall had been harvested, clover was sowed among the wheat. After the wheat was reaped in late summer, a few cattle were turned into the now ripe clover for a short time. In the third and fourth years, clover was sowed, and was mowed twice in each year. After the last mowing in Autumn of the fourth year, the ground was plowed and harrowed, and in May of the fifth year the cycle was begun again with Indian corn. Occasionally, rye or winter barley was substituted for wheat, and oats for Indian corn, in which case the oats were sowed in April. Frequently, buckwheat was sowed in June on a field containing wheat to be harvested in late summer, the buckwheat being reaped just before the November Frost.‚Äù German Agriculture in Pennsylvania, 1959, page 202.Germans and Agriculture in Colonial Pennsylvania Based on census records, Samuel likely planted potatoes, ‚ÄúIndian corn‚Äù and oats in the spring and winter wheat and winter barley in the fall. He is not recorded as producing clover, but instead was producing 10‚Äì18 tons of hay plus seed. The production of hay, combined with the a surviving 1927 blueprint of a barn as large or larger than the house, eludes to Schenck both housing and feeding his cattle and horses through the winter months rather than penning or sending them into the woods or field in the coldest months. The housing and feeding of cattle and farm animals through the coldest months was introduced by the German, Swiss and Dutch farmers. This was not typically practices in England, Ireland and Scotland. ‚Äúthe Germans differed from practically all other Pennsylvania farmers, with the exception of the few Dutch, in providing shelter for their animals in winter. A traveler of the mid-eighteenth century noted shortly after his arrival in Pennsylvania that cattle around Philadelphia were neither housed in winter nor tended in the fields; after having been in the country for some time, however, he remarked that while the English and Swedes had no stables, the Germans and Dutch had ‚Äúpreserved the custom of their country, and generally kept their cattle in barns during the winter‚Ä¶. They kept their animals as warm as possible in winter, and thereby effected considerable savings in hay and grain, for they found that cold animals eat more than warm ones‚Ä¶. the Germans began to build large barns rather than houses. The attention paid by Germans to the construction of barns, which became the envy of the non-German countryside, was brought out by one observer of 1753, who commented that ‚ÄúIt is pretty to behold our back- settlements, where the barns are large as palaces, while the owners live in log hutts; a sign tho‚Äô of thriving farmers‚Ä¶.The vegetable gardens were filled with weeds, intermingled with cabbages, turnips, and other plants.\\" German Agriculture in Pennsylvania, 1959, page 197.

Medical career After completing his medical studies at Cambridge University and St George's Hospital, Rice joined the Royal Naval Reserve in 1939 as a Surgeon Lieutenant. He served in the Navy throughout the war, finishing with the rank of Surgeon Lieutenant- Commander.Wisden 1947 p. 222. He was one of the pioneers of the use of lithium therapy for the mentally ill. After the war he worked as Deputy Medical Superintendent at Graylingwell Hospital, a large psychiatric hospital in Chichester in Sussex. In the early 1950s an Australian colleague showed him an article by John Cade in The Medical Journal of Australia on the beneficial effects of lithium on patients with mania. He decided to try it on some of his more severely affected patients, and found it worked in many cases. He wrote up the results in a 1956 edition of the Journal of Mental Science, after which his work was followed up in Britain by his colleague Ronald Maggs and others.F. Neil Johnson, The History of Lithium Therapy, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 1984, pp. 105-106. In 1956 he moved to Hellingly Hospital in Hailsham, another large psychiatric hospital in Sussex, as Medical Superintendent, where he remained for the rest of his career. He wrote a history of the hospital after it closed in 1994. Cricket career Rice played cricket, as a medium- pace bowler and lower-order batsman, well into his fifties. Aside from club cricket he played numerous games for the Royal Navy, two non-first-class matches for Sussex in 1945, and one match in 1946 for Norfolk in the Minor Counties Championship. He made his first-class debut at the age of 46 years and 95 days (the oldest first-class debutant in the British Isles since 1924) when he captained Col. L. C. Stevens' XI against Cambridge University at The Saffrons ground in Eastbourne in July 1960. There were four other first-class debutants in his team, as well as the former England Test captain Len Hutton, aged 44, and the Indian prince and future Test player Indrajitsinhji. Rice was also captain in the corresponding match in 1961, when his team included the current Test player Tom Graveney and the 49-year-old Sussex veteran George Cox. Personal life Rice's father, also called David Rice (1871‚Äì1935), was the medical superintendent of Hellesdon Hospital, a large psychiatric asylum near Norwich. Rice had an elder sister, Evelyn, and a younger brother, Hugh, who was also a physician and first-class cricketer. David Rice Hospital, in Drayton, a suburb of Norwich, which operated from 1937 to about 2005, was named after their father. Rice was married twice: he and his first wife Joan had four children; after she died he married his second wife, Mary, who survived him. They lived in The Elms in the village of Ringmer in East Sussex. He died in Brighton in 1997 at the age of 83.

It stars Nivin Pauly in dual roles, as a cunning student political leader (Krishnakumar) and a senior social activist and comrade (Sakhavu Krishnan) who fights for his left-wing ideals. Aishwarya Rajesh plays the heroine. The film was released on 15 April 2017 to positive reviews. Plot Krishnakumar aka Kichu (Nivin Pauly) is a ruthless youth wing's leader at a district level of his political party. He plans to get into a better position at his SFK party by destroying the political career of other competitors in his party. He arranges people to beat up his competitor, even though he is Kichu's close friend. He gets a call from Kuriachan (Renji Panicker) who is a leader of his political party. He tells Kichu to go to hospital and donate blood for a comrade as Kichu has the rare blood group O Negative. Kichu(Krishna Kumar) was forced to go to hospital but he tells his friend Mahesh (Althaf Salim) that he will get the hell out of there without wasting his time. He makes a lot of mess at hospital and tells the acquaintance of the recipient to get food for him. Kichu was thinking that the recipient was a less known comrade but he was stunned by seeing even the chief minister paying a visit to see the wounded recipient. Now Kichu is eager to know this so-called comrade and asks Prabhakaran(an acquaintance of comrade) about him. Prabhakaran starts to tell the story of comrade Krishnan, the patient. Krishnan was a party member who was sent to Peerumedu by party's Kottayam district committee to develop their party's influence there. Krishnan raised voice against the poor wage giving to workers at tea estate but the manager of the estate was not interested in raising the wage. Krishnan led a strike with all the workers and the tea factory was forced to raise the wage. Krishnan's next move was against a Brahmin landlord. The landlord was giving labour to Tamil people for poor wage instead of malayalees. Krishnan and his party talked to the landlord but he didn't negotiate. And the landlord didn't do the cultivation that year. Krishnan and workers started cultivating in the landlord's land and produced a good yield. They were ready to give the yield to the landlord at a condition that he should give them the proper wage. He was forced to accept. Krishnan gave word to comrade Janaki's family that he would marry her. They got married after some events. After some years Krishnan had a stroke and got into partial paralysis. Then he came to know that the old factory where they did their first strike was closed down and workers are in poverty. Krishnan visited a rich man who had got many helps from him and asked him if he can buy that estate and start the factory. He accepted it at a request that Krishnan should be one among in the governing body of the factory. Krishnan accepted this and later came to know that a young man Tony had captured some of the land in the estate. Krishnan ordered him to get his resort closed. Tony stabbed Krishnan after somedays at a night to retain his resort and that's the story of Krishnan. Kichu now comes to know that the way he is living is not the way a comrade should live. Krishnan's surgery was successful and all of them in the hospital was happy. Kichu hesitated to see Krishnan's face as he had cherished his personality in his heart. Kichu goes to peerumedu with his youth wing comrades and beatsup Tony who stabbed Krishnan and he proclaims that Krishnan's legend will be continued through them.

Hugh Barry on October 18, 2016, in her home in the Bronx, New York. According to police sources, she was armed with first a pair of scissors and then a baseball bat. According to an emergency medical technician, she had put the scissors down, and later on picked up a baseball bat. Barry was charged with murder and manslaughter in May, 2017. He was acquitted in February 2018. On October 18th, 2016, a neighbor called 911 at 6:05 p.m. and reported that Danner was erratic. Police had been called to her apartment before. According to the police, Danner had scissors, and Barry talked her into putting them down. Then she picked up a baseball bat and swung at him. Barry shot Danner twice, fatally wounding her. He was the only officer in the bedroom, although others were on the scene. According to court testimony by Brittney Mullings, an emergency medical technician, Mullings had arrived before Barry. Danner had put down the scissors and Mullings was talking to her. Danner was not holding anything in her hands. Mullings was trying to explain to Danner why they had arrived. Barry then arrived, and did not talk to Mullings or Danner. The police interrupted their conversation, and Danner retreated into her bedroom. Six police officers followed Danner into her bedroom, and a minute later, Mullings heard two shots. Background Danner was mentally ill and had written an essay, \\"Living With Schizophrenia\\", in 2012. She was a parishioner who regularly attended Trinity Church Wall Street, and was active in that community's groups and ministries.  Aftermath  Less than six hours after the death, Sergeant Barry was placed on administrative duty and stripped of his badge and gun. According to The New York Times, \\"Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference that the sergeant had not followed training or protocols for dealing with those with mental illness, and for some reason had neither used his Taser nor waited for specialized officers trained to deal with such situations.\\" The death of Danner, who was black, spurred a protest on October 19. Protestors marched from her apartment building to the 43rd Precinct station house. Marchers included members of the New York Black Lives Matter chapter. Barry was arrested and charged with second-degree murder on May 31, 2017. On February 14, 2018, Barry was acquitted by a judge in a non-jury trial. The judge ruled Barry as innocent of all charges.

Like other types of thrust reversals, it temporarily divert the engine exhaust (thrust) forward to provide deceleration. This type of thrust-reverser is suitable for engines of or greater thrust. A Target-type Thrust Reverser in Deployed Location on a Fokker 70  Mechanism  The part that provides reverse thrust for thrust reversal is the deflector doors (\\"bucket\\") with aerodynamic contour on both inner and outer surface at the tailpipe of a jet engine. The doors are in a deployed location when thrust reversal takes effect and at stowed location when otherwise. When deployed, the doors block the airflow in the end of the engine. In this case airflow passes through the inner surface and travels frontward to provide force opposite to the heading of the aircraft. When stowed, the doors seamlessly connect to the rest parts of the engine to provide a streamlined outer surface. A pair of beams are located in the left and right of the engines with a sled in each of them. The two doors are connected to both sleds by two rods each. A hydraulic actuator connected to each sled is placed in each beam. The actuator extends to deploy the thrust reversal and retracts to stow the thrust reversal in a way that the rods push the doors to rotate about a point at the end of the tailpipe. The actuator may be connected hydraulically, mechanically or electrically to the control system of the aircraft. In operation, thrust reversers on all engines typically work together, although they can be activated separately by pilots or aircraft operators.  History  Target- type thrust reversal, particularly this design, was invented in 1968. This invention is stated to be an improvement to previous design. As early as 1963, an invention called \\"two part thrust reversal\\" appeared with a similar deflector door design. However, in two part thrust reverser, the mechanism for door deployment and location of deflector doors are significantly different from those of target-type thrust reverser. The inventors (one also as inventor of target-type) states that the design can increase the reverse thrust to 50% of the original thrust. In an earlier development in 1954 called \\"locks for jet thrust reversers\\", the design for thrust reversal also contain a flap device to help decelerate and the main purpose of the thrust reverser was to block airflow rather than provide reverse thrust. Dated back to 1945, the first invented thrust reversal device intended to \\"provide a deflecting device\\", which can be identified as the first concept for target-type thrust reverser.  Performance  The reverse-thrust ratio (ratio of backward engine thrust to forward reverse thrust) can be as high as 84%. However, this result is obtained with a cowl to attach air flow in a 7¬∞ angle and a large enough \\"target\\" (deflector door) installed. A reverse-thrust ratio of 55% can be reached on a simple target without the cowl. A width to height ratio of 1.6 can provide the maximum performance for cylindrical deflector doors.  Advantage  Unlike other types of thrust reversals, especially cascade type thrust reversal, which typically require major redesigns when applied to different models of engines, target-type thrust reversal has a much simpler mechanism and involves lesser installation inside the engine body. Also due to the simple design, the maintenance cost can be much lower than other designs.  In-flight deployment  In most occasions, thrust reversers are deployed after the aircraft touches down. However, some engines with target-type thrust reversers allow in-flight deployment, which means the thrust reversers being deployed when the aircraft is still in air. A considerable part of Russia-made aircraft like the Tupolev Tu-154 and Ilyushin Il-62 have this feature. Their thrust reversers can be deployed when the landing gears are still a few meters from the ground. The Douglas DC-8, on the other hand, is qualified to use thrust reversal anytime in flight for speed adjustment.  Application  Target-type thrust reversal is commonly applied to low bypass turbofan engines or turbojet engines. In this kind of engine with low bypass ratio, the core part of the engine produces a significantly larger part of the thrust. Therefore, the airflow from the core part must be blocked in order to produce sufficient reverse thrust.  Variations  There are two major variations for this type of thrust reversal.  Screw jack mechanism  This design changes the hydraulic actuator to a mechanic actuator, specifically, screw jacks operated by motors. The inventors state that this design can reduce the weight of the engine and the maintenance cost since the system is more simplified.  Pivot fairing thrust reverser  This design makes modification on the aerodynamic performance when the thrust reverser is at stowed location. It optimizes the shape of outlet nozzle from fishmouth shape to round shape. It also compresses the deployment system to reduce weight and complexity. In particular, this design moves the deflector doors from very end of the engine to a front position where it has no contact with the aerodynamic design of the outlet nozzle.  Accidents  * October 31, 1996 ‚Äî TAM Transportes A√©reos Regionais Flight 402, a Fokker 100, crashed seconds after taking off from S√£o Paulo‚ÄìCongonhas Airport in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. All 89 passengers and six crew members died along with several people on the ground. The investigation showed that the accident was caused by an uncommanded in-flight deployment of the thrust reverser on one engine; a deficient system design that did not take such a situation in to account; and shortcomings in pilot training procedures.

Tran Thi Thuy is a member of pro-democracy political party, Viet Tan  2010 Arrest  On August 10, Thuy was arrested at her home by members of the Public Security without an arrest warrant. Thuy‚Äôs family was not informed of the arrest until 10 days later, when they received a communique notifying them of the arrest.  2011 Conviction  On May 30, during a one-day trial held in Southern Ben Tre, Thuy was charged under Article 79, attempting to overthrow the government, an article typically used to imprison peaceful activists, and sentenced to an eight-year prison term and five years under house arrest. Six other people were tried with Thuy, including Pastor Duong Kim Khai, Nguyen Thanh Tam, Pham Van Thong, Cao Van Tinh, Nguyen Chi Thanh, and Pham Ngoc Hoa. All seven defendants were charged under Article 79 of Vietnam‚Äôs Penal Code and received jail terms between two to eight years The May 30 trial was heavily secured and sealed-off by uniformed and plainclothes police.  Prison Treatment and Conditions  Since her arrest, Thuy has been subjected to physical abuse and the denial of medical treatment. Prior to the trial, Thuy had been beaten in the abdomen by security police. Since her imprisonment, Thuy was subject to forced labour, specifically, the husking and skinning of cashews. She was not given proper protection and suffered caustic burns on her skin as a result. Thuy was given long hours of work which resulted in repeated fainting spells. Thuy is being jailed with common criminals who have been ordered to intimidate her by prison authorities. In April 2015, Thuy became seriously ill with a uterine tumor. She was denied sufficient medical treatment and was told that she must admit to her crime or die in prison. On September 2, 2016, upon visiting Thuy, her brother, Tran Anh Tuan informed Amnesty International that her health has seriously deteriorated and that she did not initially recognize who he was due to being in a confused state. On October 11, 2016, an Amnesty International update said that Thuy's health was deteriorating rapidly. She had been in excruciating pain and her tumours had begun to ulcerate. Food and medication have continued to be withheld by authorities until she confesses.  International Response  The arrest, conviction and mistreatment of Thuy has been condemned by various organizations and individuals worldwide. * In 2011, Thuy‚Äôs mother, Bui Thi Nu, wrote an appeal addressed to the UNHRC, International human rights organizations, media organizations, and friends from all over the world.

The book is the fourth in an Indiana Jones-style action series, and is a continuation of the story established in The Five Greatest Warriors. The series is published by Pan Macmillan and the book was first released on 20 October 2016 in Australia. Synopsis Eight years after successfully constructing the Great Machine and preventing the Dark Sun from destroying the earth, Jack West Jr. has retired to his farm in Western Australia. While his adopted daughter Lily--now a twenty-year-old college student--is visiting him, he is called to the Pine Gap military installation to consult on an unusual anomaly detected by its top secret telescopic array. West speculates that the anomaly is a rogue galaxy hurtling across the universe, and that a collision with the Milky Way Galaxy-- an apocalyptic event--is imminent. However, before he can draw any further conclusions, the facility is attacked and West abducted. West awakens in a locked cell and is attacked by a man in a bull-shaped mask resembling a minotaur. West kills the man and escapes the cell to find himself in an arena with fifteen other men, most of whom were prepared for the attack. The group is addressed by a man calling himself Hades, who announces that the sixteen men are the sixteen champions chosen to take part in the Hydra Games. By completing the games, the champions will acquire nine spheres of golden quartz which will unlock a temple within the arena and complete a ritual required to save the world. In order to ensure the champions' loyalty, each man has been implanted with an explosive device and their friends and families held hostage. Each round of the Hydra Games is brutal, with the champions facing physical challenges of endurance and mortal combat, with the last-placed champion and their hostages killed. Furthermore, Hades is obliged to grant the winner of each round a request, which many champions use to have their rivals killed. Between each round, the champions are given the opportunity to recuperate, and West is approached by Ioanthe Compton-Jones, a member of the British royal family who reveals that the Hydra Games are being run by the four kingdoms that have secretly ruled the world for millennia. By completing the ritual at the conclusion of the Hydra Games, mankind will avert the incoming rogue galaxy. West arranged to have Lily use her position as the Oracle of Siwa to escape captivity and spy on the royals spectating on the Games. Meanwhile, Stretch and Pooh Bear discover West's abduction. Using a sketch of the rogue galaxy as a clue, they track down West's mother, Mae Merriweather, to try and find him. Mae shared her hypothesis with them: that there is a consciousness at the centre of the universe popularly known as God that has been trying to establish contact with earth. Unsatisfied with the progress of humanity, it releases a rogue galaxy every few thousand years to destroy large swarthes of the universe and start over. The Hydra Games is an ancient ritual designed to send a message back to the centre of the universe and prove humanity's worth. Over the course of the Hydra Games, West distinguishes himself by saving E-147, a man in a minotaur costume, from certain death and discovers that the minotaur is a direct descendant of the Neanderthals. He befriends one of the other champions, Shane Schofield, who like West was abducted to participate in the Games, and the two plan to free their hostages when they discover that all of the hostages will be killed halfway through the Hydra Games. The rescue is successful, but West is captured and about to be executed when he is saved by Schofield; having won a round of the Games, Schofield asks Hades to spare West's life as a reward. Having reached the midway point of the Games, the first stage of the ritual is completed, and the rogue galaxy averted. Ioanthe reveals that the next part of the Games will pass the knowledge necessary to save the world on to one of the four kings: the rogue galaxy was a forerunner to an \\"Omega Event\\", the total destruction of the universe via a Big Crunch and another Big Bang that will create a new universe. This knowledge will allow one of the four kings to reign over the world unopposed. West also discovers that one of Hades' sons, Dion, intends to usurp his father's position and forcibly marry Lily while his brother Zaitan completes the ritual and passes the knowledge onto him. The next stage of the Hydra Games requires the surviving champions to fight each other to the death. West is forced to kill Schofield before realising that each round mirrors the Twelve Labours of Hercules--who was a previous champion of the Hydra Games--and uses this knowledge to progress through the final rounds. The ritual is completed, but West intervenes before the knowledge can be passed on to his king. The royals are horrified at this sacrilege, but before they can react, the temple is attacked by hordes of Neanderthals dressed as minotaurs, having been inspired by West's saving E-147. Dion is killed during their escape and Schofield revived, having used hyper-oxygenated blood to feign his death. Having realised that Hades was the only royal who was not taking part in the Hydra Games for his own personal gain, West convinced him to join in the next stage of the quest: locating three lost cities that contain the knowledge needed to prevent the Omega Event.

The film stars Suriya and Keerthy Suresh with a supporting cast including Karthik, Ramya Krishnan, Nandha, Kalaiyarasan, RJ Balaji, and Suresh Chandra Menon. The film's music was composed by Anirudh Ravichander and cinematography performed by Dinesh Krishnan and edited by A. Sreekar Prasad.The film is an adaptation of the 2013 Hindi film Special 26, which was inspired by the 1987 Opera House heist in Mumbai. Principal photography of the film commenced in September 2016. Thaana Serndha Kootam had a worldwide theatrical release on 12 January 2018. The film grossed more than ‚Çπ60 crore (US$12.5 million) at the Tamil Nadu box office.  Plot  All the events in this movie happen in the period of 1986‚Äì1987. The film begins with Pallavaram Paranjothi Pandian attending an interview for a clerk's post and getting rejected due to lack of money for giving bribes to the officials. Now the story shifts to Nachinarkiniyan aka Iniyan attending CBI interviews and his friend attending police interviews. Both get rejected due to lack of bribe money for the post. Iniyan's father Porchelvan works as a CBI office clerk. He wants his son to be an officer, hence he pleads for the posting for his son to his higher officials. However, he earned the wrath of his senior official officer Uthaman, a corrupt official. Once during a raid, he asks for money. Porchelvan did not approve of this and complains about Uthaman in the form of an anonymous letter. Uthaman comes to know about this and exacts revenge by purposely rejecting and humiliating Iniyan at the interview and later asking him to bribe in order to get the job. Iniyan and his father are dejected, and Iniyan's friend is dejected due to his failure in the interview, and he later commits suicide. Iniyan is depressed after all these events and decides to loot money from the corrupted and rich people. He loots black money and tries to reform society, making sure the deserved people get posting in the government departments. He forms a gang with him and starts to heist by posing as CBI and income tax officers. The CBI appoints Kurunjivendhan to investigate and capture the thieves. Meanwhile, Iniyan falls in love with Madhu, and she accepts his marriage proposal. One day, the gang conducts an interview for the CBI (fake). The gang plans to raid a jewelry shop. Uthaman and Kurunjivendhan come to know about this, but learn that they already came and finished the raid. Kurunjivendhan apprehends Iniyan and wants him to be a police inspector, but he rejects the offer as he believes that even more good can be done if he continued to do his deeds. He then reveals the force with kurunjivendhan is actually the men he gave jobs using the heist money.He escapes the place with ease. Later on we see him escaping abroad with Madhu and all his other accomplices.

Linguswamy subsequently bought the rights of the film and planned to produce the venture in collaboration with Friday Filmworks, who had made the original version. Linguswamy held initial discussions with Kamal Haasan, Suriya, Karthi and Vikram about portraying the film's lead role with Sathyaraj, but the production failed to materialise. In August 2014, producer Thiagarajan announced that he had purchased the Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada language rights to remake Special 26, and revealed that he would also direct all four ventures. Thiagarajan's son Prashanth was revealed to be playing the lead role in the Tamil version, while Prakash Raj and Sathyaraj were signed to portray supporting roles. A further press release in March 2015 stated that Srikanth Ravichandran, then husband of television host Divyadarshini, would instead direct the film and that he had already begun work on planning music compositions with Thaman. The team also revealed that they had signed on actress Trisha to feature in the leading female role.http://www.sify.com/movies/after-queen-it-is-special-26-remake-for- thyagarajan-news-tamil-pdsl2xfighcdh.html After a period of little development, Prashanth revealed to the media in September 2015 that the film's shoot would commence soon after with Madhesh as the director of the project. A press release in December 2015 suggested that Simran and Devayani would also be a part of the cast, while Jacqueline Fernandez would appear in a song. It was also stated that Anirudh Ravichander had been signed on to compose the film's music and Sreekar Prasad would be the film's editor. Thiagarajan revealed that he would adapt the original film's script and dialogues to suit a Tamil audience and that filming would take place in Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai. The film failed to materialise over 2016 and it was widely reported in the media that the remake rights of the original film had been transferred from Thiagarajan to Studio Green and the film was to be made as Thaana Serndha Kootam by Vignesh Shivan with Suriya in the lead role.http://www.sify.com/movies/suriya-s-team-in-thaana-serndha-kootam-news- tamil-rcrl1Hcegfcdh.html The title was taken from a dialogue spoken by Rajinikanth in Baashha (1995).http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/regional/suryias-next- movie-title-taken-from-rajinikanths-punch-dialogue-3042786/ However in an interview during February 2017, Thiagarajan insisted that the film was still being planned with Prashanth in the lead role. In late 2017, Thiagarajan made an application seeking an interim stay of the film's release, claiming that his studio of Staar Movies still owned the film's rights. He stated that Staar Movies had entered into an agreement with the original producers, Viacom, in August 2014 and obtained the rights to remake the movie in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada and that the agreement was valid for a period of three years. In early January 2018, the High Court refused the interim order application and called for the issues to be decided in a civil claim.  Filming  Vignesh Shivan agreed to work on Thaanaa Serndha Koottam at short notice, after another project, Kaathu Vaakkula Rendu Kadhal with Vijay Sethupathi became delayed. Studio Green's K. E. Gnanavel Raja asked Vignesh to do a project to star Suriya and the team chos to use an earlier script planned by Vignesh on the 1987 Opera House heist, like Special 26, where a group posing as Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officers executed an income tax raid on the jeweller in Mumbai, which he initially wanted to make with either actors Sivakarthikeyan or Vijay Sethupathi. The team claimed to legally purchase the remake rights of Special 26, but instead of copying the film scene-by-scene, Vignesh was insistent that it was adapted to make it suitable for Tamil-speaking audiences. The film was announced to the public in September 2016, with the shoot starting thereafter in October 2016. Keerthy Suresh was signed on as the lead actress, while an ensemble cast of veteran actors including Ramya Krishnan, Suresh Chandra Menon, Senthil and Sudhakar were also a part of the first schedule. The film was predominantly shot across Chennai and Mysore, with the shoot finishing in August 2017. Post-production works for the film were completed at Knack Studios in Chennai. The film was also dubbed in Telugu as Gang, with Suriya choosing to dub for himself in Telugu for the first time.  Music  Vignesh Shivan teamed up with Anirudh Ravichander to compose the soundtrack and background score of the film, once again after Naanum Rowdydhaan. This film also marks the first collaboration of Anirudh with Suriya. The tracklist features five songs, with lyrics for songs were written by Thamarai, Vignesh Shivan and Mani Amudhavan, where the former and latter penned two songs each and the rest of the songs were penned by Vignesh Shivan. Sony Music acquired the rights of the soundtrack album. The first single track \\"Naana Thaana\\" was released on 26 July 2017, sung by Anirudh himself with lyrics written by Vignesh Shivan. On 16 October 2017, coinciding with Anirudh Ravichander's birthday the teaser of the second single \\"Sodakku\\" was released of YouTube. The full song was released on 26 October 2017. The promotional video song of \\"Sodakku\\" was released on 27 October 2017, featuring members of the film's cast as well as Sheril, who rose to fame with her dance cover of the song \\"Entammede Jimikki Kammal\\" from Velipadinte Pusthakam (2017). Another single track \\"Peela Peela\\" was released on 23 December 2017. The title track of Thaana Serndha Koottam, was released on 30 December 2017.

Track listing All lyrics written by Niharika Baijal. Reception A critic from Behindwoods.com noted \\"Anirudh's magical combination with Vignesh Shivan continues as the album shines high on variety\\", and gave the album a rating of 3.25 out of 5 stars. Another reviewer from The Times of India wrote \\"Anirudh and Vignesh's combination has worked again ‚Äì and the composer only proves, time and again, to experiment and give some fine tracks for each album he works on\\".

Most copies of the publication were printed for particular productions and distributed at the door as the show's program. It was launched as a direct rival to the highly successful monthly Playbill. But after five years of head-to-head competition with Playbill, Stagebill became insolvent and was acquired by its rival which also kept the Stagebill trademark. History Stagebill was launched as a direct competition to Playbill, a highly successful publication. Playbill concentrated on Broadway and Off-Broadway theaters, while Stagebill positioned itself as a publication focused on concerts, opera, and dance in venues such as Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall. B&B; Enterprises, Inc. acquired Stagebill in 1969. The company owned the magazine until 1994 when it was acquired by K-III Communications based in New York City. In the 1990s Shira Kalish was the publisher of the magazine. She was succeeded by Darcy Miller Donaldson in the post. However, by the late 1990s, Playbill was extremely profitable; Stagebill was not, losing millions of dollars annually by 1998. To increase revenue, Stagebill entered Playbills turf. Its first major attempt was in 1995 when The Public Theater defected to Stagebill. A bigger rift came in 1997, when Disney contracted Stagebill for its big musical production The Lion King at the newly reopened New Amsterdam Theatre. The main point of contention in the latter case was control over advertising content: Playbill is distributed free to theaters, relying on advertising revenue that is completely under its authority, whereas per company policy; Disney required a program without cigarette or liquor ads. In response to Stagebill's upstart incursion, Playbill began to produce Showbill, a sister publication that conformed to Disney's advertising requirements for all publications distributed in its properties. Playbill responded further by producing publications for classic arts venues, aggressively courting many venues that were once Stagebill clients like the Metropolitan Opera, the Carnegie Hall and the New York Philharmonic. With a more aggressive policy of acquiring publicity for more performing arts venues, Playbill broke from its typical format and began publishing completely customized programs in the vein of Stagebill. This coupled with continuing fiscal troubles of Stagebill signaled the end of it as a publishing entity. Stagebill became insolvent in summer 2002 and in September 2002 it was acquired by its rival Playbill which also kept the Stagebill trademark.

However, particle interactions such as multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) and (in)elastic nuclear scattering events deflect the proton trajectory, resulting in nonlinear paths which can only be approximated via statistical assumptions, leading to lower spatial resolution than X-ray tomography. Further experiments were largely abandoned until the advent of proton radiation therapy in the 1990s which renewed interest in the topic due to the potential benefits of imaging and treating patients with the same particle. Description Proton Computed Tomography (pCT) uses measurements of a proton's position/trajectory and energy before and after traversing an object to reconstruct an image of the object where each voxel (three dimensional pixel) represents the relative stopping power (RSP) of the material composition of the corresponding region of the object. The deviations of a proton's path inside the object are primarily due to interactions between the Coulomb fields of the proton and the nuclei in the absorbing material, resulting in many small-angle deflections as it passes through the object. Statistical models of the effect of MCS on the trajectory of a proton were developed to calculate the most likely path (MLP) of a proton given its entry and exit position/trajectory and corresponding uncertainty at intermediate depths within the object. Additional (in)elastic nuclear scattering events can also occur which cause larger angle deviations, which cannot easily be modeled, but these are fairly easy to identify and remove from consideration in the image reconstruction process. With an approximate path of a proton through the object, one can then identify the voxels through which the proton passed, and the difference between entry and exit energy indicates the energy collectively deposited in these voxels. Assuming there are J voxels in the image, the distance, \\\\Delta l_j, the proton travels through each voxel j\\\\in J varies along the path and the amount of energy deposited in each voxel, \\\\Delta E_h, depends on this and the voxel's RSP, x_j. The total energy loss E is the line integral of RSP scaled by the intersection length, or E=\\\\int x_j\\\\Delta l_j ReferencesFurther reading   * \\"Use of Protons for Radiotherapy\\", A.M.

A Rocker Shovel is usually powered by compressed air, or in some cases electricity. It is commonly mounted on steel wheels designed to run on narrow gauge rails, with some later models using metal or rubber-tyred road wheels. The operator, standing on a raised platform to one side of the machine, operates the controls, one lever to drive the machine along the tracks, and another to raise and lower the bucket. Once the bucket has been filled by driving the loader forwards into the pile of material, the rocker mechanism throws the contents over the top of the machine and into a wagon behind. Once full, the loaded wagon can be taken away and replaced with an empty one to allow loading to continue. On 28 May 1937, Edwin Burton Royle applied for a patent as inventor of the \\"loading machine\\" and US Patent No. 2,134,582 was issued on October 25, 1938 and assigned to the Eastern Iron Metals Company (later to be known as EIMCO). In 2000, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers added the EIMCO 12B Rocker Shovel Loader of 1938 to its List of Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmarks as reference number 212 out of a total number of 259 objects (as of 2015). In June 2012, an EIMCO 12B Rocker Shovel was featured in an episode of the American reality television series Auction Hunters, filmed in Littleton, Colorado. It was sold to a gold miner for $3,600.

P. nobilitatus are popular study subjects because they are easy to recognize and are of large size. They mainly reside around ponds and wet lands, where most of their hunting and mating take place. Their mating ritual is highly studied due to their distinctive mate selection behaviors.  Range  P. nobilitatus have been found in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK.  Appearance  Poecilobothrus nobilitatus sitting on leaf Many flies in the Dolichopodidae family have metallic green reflections in their cornea due to the cornea's wavelength-selective spectral reflectance. Their cornea is built like a multi-layered mirror that reduces the transmission of green light to the cornea's light receptors. This results in distinctive green iridescent eyes that many of the flies have.  Sexual dimorphism  The P. nobilitatus species exhibits sexual dimorphism; females and males have distinctive wing markings. Males are usually 7mm long and are smoky black on the distal half of their wings and white on the tips. Their thorax and abdomen are a shiny golden green. Males tend to be bigger than the females and usually have a wing length of 5.7¬± 0.4mm, whereas females have a wingspan of 5.2¬± .03mm. The wing spread of males is about 1mm larger than that of similarly sized females. Reproducing males have a larger wingspan length of 6.0¬±0.3mm compared to randomly caught males that have a wingspan length of 5.7¬±0.4mm. In the Dolichopodidae family, there is a lot of diversity in the male signaling organs. The differences in the signaling organs can be found on the antennae, all legs, the wings, the cerci, and certain abdominal projections.  Reproductive Behaviors = Courtship  Poecilobothrus nobilitatus has one of the most complicated courtships studied by researchers. Courtship for males is focused on a single female, and the presence of other males can strongly affect a female's choice. This can cause courtship to be a mutual choice rather than a combination of successive choices. The length of the courtship display is determined by individual courtship phases, less repetition of the courtship phases, and possible interruption by male competition. For example, in the presence of many females and males, the courting males might delay courtship in favor of time-consuming, male-male interactions. If the female is feeding on prey, the male will court the female for a longer amount of time. During this courtship males perform an aerial display just for the female they are interested in. The courtship starts with the male doing short intervals of wing waving, and then he hovers in front of the female. This display is then followed by two types of aerial displays, one where the male will make a circle arc around one side of the area and in the second aerial display the male will fly over the females rotating 180 degrees. Females take no obvious part in the courtship, except to terminate it by flying away. Females prefer to mate with larger males. = Stages of Courtship = The courtship has several stages. Mating is initiated when the walking male makes a quick turn to face the female. The male then extends and vibrates his wings. There can be up to 20 wing waving displays, punctuated by rests where the male might take a small side step if the female isn‚Äôt moving. After wing waving the male will takeoff and he then hovers for a little in front of the female or starts to display flight.  Male Chasing  Male chasing is a part of courtship for the Poecilobothrus nobilitatus species. Males pursue members of both sexes during courtship displays around the edges of ponds. Male Poecilobothrus nobilitatus participate in two types of male chasing. There are \\"flat out chases\\" with other males, in which males chase other males using rotation and fast forward flight. There are also less aggressive chasing methods that males do to females for courtship called ‚Äúshadowing‚Äù. They follow the females at a distance of a couple of centimeters doing rotational and lateral movements during flight.  Reproduction  Successful reproduction requires cooperation from the female that has been courted. She has to slightly spread her wings so that copulation can start. Similar to other flies in the Dolichopodidae family, the males' hypopygium is very prominent and movable by an intra-abdominal joint linked with a 180¬∞ inversion and the bending of the abdomen to start copulation.  Hunting  P. nobilitatus capturing prey on the water's surface P. nobilitatus are considered predators and hunt on the surface of ponds and wetlands. Both males and females settle on the surface of the water, and they do a series of short flights hovering about 3-6 inches over the water. They settle on the water after each flight. Males are more likely to detect possible prey before females, but females are more likely to start feeding on prey before males. In studies, the flies don't seem particularly interested in the food source and only tend to capture the larvae when they are close by.  Food Sources  P. nobilitatus' diet consists of small crustaceans, insects, potworms and Culex pipiens larvae. Most of their food sources are found in the water.  Hunting Strategy  When the Culex larvae break the water's surface to get air, the P. nobilitatus will attack with its mouth. After a short struggle the larvae will be carried on the wing of the fly and put into the mud where the fly will eat it.  Popular Study Subjects  The Poecilobothrus nobilitatus is a popular fly for animal study because of its relatively large size, evident sexual dimorphism in wing markings, and its courtship and hunting displays on a 2-dimensional surface (water), allowing for more accurate and easy studying of the species. Most of the study surrounding Poecilobothrus nobilitatus is filmed and the size and the habitat of the fly makes it easier to study them on film.

Founded in 1784 in what was then British West Florida, Kingston is one of the earliest settlements in Adams County. History The area was first settled in 1772 by Richard and Samuel Swayze of New Jersey, who purchased of land. A number of families from New Jersey followed and were known as the \\"Jersey Settlers\\", of whom actors William Holden and Patrick Swayze are descendants. In 1773, Samuel Swayze, a Congregational pastor, organized what was then the first Protestant church in British West Florida. The church lasted only until his death in 1784. An early settler, Caleb King, laid out the town in 1784 and named it after his himself. King was a surveyor by profession and came to the Jersey Settlement to survey the newly acquired lands. King briefly returned to New Jersey to marry Richard Swayze's daughter Mary, after which the couple returned to Mississippi. Tobias Gibson, the founder of Port Gibson, Mississippi, established a Methodist church in Kingston in 1799. Gibson said he \\"went to Kingston and procured a spot of ground by selling my watch for a meeting house.\\" The Kingston Methodist Church was built from logs in about 1802, and its deed was the first issued to a church of the Protestant faith in Mississippi (then called the Mississippi Territory). In 1822, Caleb King's son-in-law Daniel Farrar donated a plot of land where a brick church was built. Kingston was prosperous from 1800 to 1824, when it had three stores and a number of shops, with a population of about 150. A tornado in 1840 destroyed most of Kingston. By the early 1900s, all that remained of Kingston was a doctor's office, the church, and one dwelling. Present day Kingston Methodist Church and Cemetery are still located south of the settlement, and were placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. A station belonging to the Kingston Volunteer Fire Department is located west of the settlement.

The group was founded in time when Finland declared its independence from Russia and the members of the November Group were sometimes aggressively nationalistic in outlook, creating a distinctively Finnish form of Expressionism. The November group caused the greatest ever uproar in Finnish art. In the Finnish art community of its age it represented everything that was ugly, incompetent, distorting and primitive. Today the movement is considered one of the most important and influenced movements in Finnish art. Members of the group included Tyko Sallinen, Marcus Collin, Alvar Caw√©n, Juho Rissanen and Gabriel Engberg. These five had a group exhibition 17 November to 5 December 1917, and in decided to found a group during that exhibition.

The group took its name from month of its first exhibition. Sallinen, Collin and Caw√©n had studied in France and were familiar with French fauvism and expressionism. However, they selected to use dark grey and brownish colours instead of the bright colours favoured by French fauvism. They also took influences of cubism and Russian cube-futurism. Many of the future group members had met each other in Denmark already in 1910, where they stayed with taylor Niels-Peder Rydeng, who became a patron and collector of modern art.

History  The idea to reach young people by new songs for church services began in the 1950s. The first song in the genre was in 1955 Seigneur, mon ami by P√®re Duval who performed his religious chansons at the Protestant church assembly Kirchentag in 1962. Christians looked for an expression for reformation of thoughts and liturgy in the churches. The Protestant Evangelische Akademie Tutzing organized competitions, initiated by the minister for students (Studentenpfarrer) in Munich, G√ºnther Hegele. The first competition in 1962 received 996 entries, the first prize went to \\"Danke\\" with text and music by Martin Gotthard Schneider. \\"Stern √ºber Bethlehem\\" was written by Alfred Hans Zoller for the third competition in 1964, and became a common song of the star singers. Musicals by Andrew Lloyd Webber, in 1968 Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and in 1970 Jesus Christ Superstar, nourished tendencies to write more new music for young people. In 1972, Peter Janssens introduced the term Sacropop to Germany, for a fusion of sacred texts and musical styles derived from Pop and Rock. A 2001 study, presented at the √úberdi√∂zesane Fachtagung Neues Geistliches Lied reported more than 1895 choirs and bands active in the field of NGL. The songs became an established medium in services. Christoph Kie√üig of a Berlin band noted: \\"Das NGL ist eine der wenigen Stellen, an denen Jugendliche und Erwachsene nicht nur konsumieren.\\" (The NGL is one of the few fields where adults and young people don't only consume.) wrote in 2003 that only songs that congregations like to sing in services are truly NGL (\\"Denn nur was sich bew√§hrt, bleibt in den Gemeinden lebenden und wird als Neues Geistliches Lied praktiziert.\\"). New elements compared to traditional hymns are rhythms with syncopes and stresses on the offbeat, contemporary lyrics, and melodies that can be easily learned.  Songbooks  Collections of NGL were for example in 1970 Jericho, edited by Karl Natiesta and Tom Runggaldier, and a year later in Schalom ‚Äì √ñkumenisches Liederbuch (Schalom ‚Äì Ecumenical songbook).

History  In the Empire of Japan, there were many semi-automatic pistols such as Nambu pistols designed by Kijir≈ç Nambu, but after the Surrender of Japan, firearms development had all ceased. So law enforcement officers and military personnel of Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) were equipped with American-made firearms. With the policy of protecting industrial growth, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) had been oriented to domestic production of service firearms. In 1957, the development was started by Shin-Chu≈ç Industries under the leadership of the MITI. The development of three handguns had been promoted at the same time in parallel. Semi-automatic pistols were completed as New Nambu M57, and the revolver became New Nambu M60. Development was completed in 1958, but never entered service because of problems of interoperability between the JSDF and the United States Armed Forces. In the 1970s, the JSDF restarted the trial for 9mm caliber pistols in conjunction with the United States. Minebea, the successor of Shin-Chu≈ç Industries, developed a modified version of the M57A for the trial and contract. This version was completed as M57A1, but the JSDF selected the SIG Sauer P220 instead.https://www.milmag.pl/news/view?news_id=3884 Small number of M57As and Bs were purchased in order to maintain production capacity and experience in manufacturing small arms in Japan, but they were never issued to the JSDF nor to any law enforcement agency.https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/gun-review- smith-wesson-360j-japanese-service-revolver/ Variants The M57A is a large combat pistol for the JSDF and Maritime Safety Agency (JMSA), which was a 9√ó19mm Parabellum caliber version of the American M1911A1, in essence. The M1911A1 was the standard service pistol of the JSDF, but its recoil was too strong for small-hand people such as average Japanese people, so small-caliber version was required. The M57A1 was an improved version of the M57A in an attempt to get it accepted into the JSDF as an official sidearm, which lost to the SIG-Sauer P220 in 1982.https://modernfirearms.net/en/handguns/handguns- en/japan-semi-automatic-pistols/new-nambu-m57a-m57b-eng/ The M57B is a compact semi-automatic pistol for railroad police and airport police, based on the FN Model 1910; firing mechanism is changed from striker to hammer-based.

Shoghi Effendi was named as the first Guardian of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, and future Guardians were to be appointed from among the male descendants of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. However, since Shoghi Effendi died without having named a successor Guardian, no person could be named to fulfill the position after his death on November 4, 1957, and he remains the only individual acknowledged as Guardian of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, but his guidance remains in the written record of his many writings. Background Being  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s eldest grandson, the first son of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s eldest daughter ·∏å√≠y√° º√≠yyih Kh√°num, Shoghi Effendi had a special relationship with his grandfather. Zia Baghdadi, a contemporary Bah√° º√≠, relates that when Shoghi Effendi was only five years of age, he pestered his grandfather to write a Tablet for him, which  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° obliged.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s family physician, a German doctor who later became a Bah√° º√≠, would relate that in 1910, when Shoghi Effendi was thirteen years old,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° named him his successor, referring to him as his \\"future Elisha.\\" Shoghi Effendi remained close to his grandfather during his years as a student, first at the LaSallian Coll√®ge des Fr√®res in Haifa and later as a boarder in Beirut, first at a Catholic school and later at the Syrian Protestant College. Shoghi Effendi was to accompany his grandfather on his journeys to the West but was unable to proceed after port authorities in Naples prevented Shoghi Effendi from continuing due to illness. At the end of World War I, after he had received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Beirut, Shoghi Effendi spent nearly two years of constant companionship with  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° before proceeding to Oxford to further his studies and improve his English. At the time of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s death in Acre on November 28, 1921, Shoghi Effendi was a twenty-four-year-old student enrolled at Balliol College, Oxford. Upon reading the telegram announcing  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s death, in the home of Wellesley Tudor Pole who was Secretary of the London Local Spiritual Assembly, Shoghi Effendi passed out. After spending a few days with John Esslemont, Shoghi Effendi left England on December 16, 1921, accompanied by Lady Blomfield and his sister Ruhangiz, and arrived in Haifa on December 29.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Will and Testament, addressed to Shoghi Effendi, was read a few days after Shoghi Effendi's arrival in Haifa. Will and Testament of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° The Will and Testament of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° was written by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° on three different occasions, and the text remains in three parts. In his Will  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° addresses the Bah√° º√≠ Covenant and the role of M√≠rz√° Muhammad  ªAl√≠ as a Covenant-breaker; outlines the obligation and responsibilities of the Hands of the Cause of God; explains the election of the Universal House of Justice; and defines the institution of the Guardianship as a hereditary office with its essential function as Interpreter of the Bah√° º√≠ writings. Shoghi Effendi describes the Will, along with the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas, the Tablets of the Divine Plan, and the Tablet of Carmel, as one of the charters of the Bah√° º√≠ Administrative Order.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s will provided a framework for the Guardian within the Bah√° º√≠ administration including: *A requirement that the Guardian appoint his successor \\"in his own life-time ... that differences may not arise after his [the Guardian's] passing.\\" The appointee was required to be either the first-born son of the Guardian, or one of the Aghs√°n (literally: Branches; male descendants of Bah√° ºu'll√°h). Finally,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° left a responsibility to nine Hands of the Cause, elected from all of the Hands, who \\"whether unanimously or by a majority vote, must give their assent to the choice of the one whom the Guardian of the Cause of God hath chosen as his successor.\\" * ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s will also stated that the Hands of the Cause were to be nominated and appointed by the Guardian and are to be under his direction and obey his command. *The Guardian is to be the head of the Universal House of Justice and either attend its deliberations in person or appoint a representative to do so. * ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s will stipulates that Huq√∫qu'll√°h, which had been made directly to Bah√° ºu'll√°h and  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° during their lifetimes, would henceforth be made to the Guardian. Appointing Shoghi Effendi as Guardian Although in the Kit√°b-i- ªAhd Bah√° ºu'll√°h designates M√≠rz√° Muhammad  ªAl√≠ as  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s successor, in his Will,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° reprimands his brother as \\"The Center of Sedition, the Prime Mover of mischief\\" and establishes the institution of the Guardianship, appointing Shoghi Effendi to this newly created office: Shoghi Effendi writings on the Institution of the Guardianship  As Guardian, Shoghi Effendi held a new and distinct role. Building on the foundation that had been established in  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s will, Shoghi Effendi elaborated on the role of the Guardian in the developing Bah√° º√≠ Administrative Order in several works, including Bah√° º√≠ Administration and the World Order of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, in the chapter entitled The Administrative Order. In those works, Shoghi Effendi goes to great lengths to emphasize that the Guardianship is a distinct station from that of Manifestation or Center of the Covenant: Shoghi Effendi also was critical of Bah√° º√≠s referring to him as a holy personage, asking them not to celebrate his birthday or have his picture on display. Furthermore, he did not refer to his own personal role as an individual, but instead to the institution of the Guardianship. In his correspondences, Shoghi Effendi signed his letters to Bah√° º√≠s as \\"brother\\" and \\"co-worker,\\" to the extent that even when addressing youth, he referred to himself as \\"Your True Brother.\\" Instead, Shoghi Effendi goes to great lengths to emphasize the significance of the \\"Institution of Guardianship,\\" which he calls the \\"head cornerstone of the Administrative Order of the Cause of Bah√° ºu'll√°h,\\" In his writings, Shoghi Effendi delineates a distinct separation of powers between the \\"twin pillars that support this mighty Administrative Structure‚Äîthe institutions of the Guardianship and of the Universal House of Justice.\\" Rights of the Guardian *Interpreter of the Bah√° º√≠ writing : As Guardian, Shoghi Effendi was the \\"Interpreter of the Word of God,\\" \\"with the right and obligation to interpret the Bah√° º√≠ teachings.\\" His interpretations of the writings of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° were authoritative and binding. *Expulsion and excommunication : The Guardian has the power to declare Bah√° º√≠s who cause disunity in the Faith as Covenant-breakers: After Shoghi Effendi Although the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas requires every Bah√° º√≠ to have a will, Shoghi Effendi did not have one when he died unexpectedly of Asian Flu on November 4, 1957 in London, England. Shoghi Effendi did not have any children and had not designated a successor Guardian. With all living male descendants of Bah√° ºu'll√°h having been declared Covenant-breakers by either  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° or Shoghi Effendi, no suitable qualifying candidates remained for appointment to the office of Guardian. On November 19, 1957, nine of the Hands of the Cause issued an \\"Official Statement\\" after searching through Shogi Effendi's personal effects in Haifa, Israel, affirming that \\"the safe and desk have been opened and searched and the non existence of a Will and Testament executed by Shoghi Effendi was definitely established.\\" A subsequent \\"Unanimous Proclamation of the 27 Hands of the Cause of God\\" on November 25 confirmed that Shoghi Effendi had died \\"without having appointed his successor.\\" The Hands of the Cause unanimously voted it was impossible to legitimately recognize and assent to a successor. The Bah√° º√≠ community was in a situation not dealt with explicitly in the provisions of the Will and Testament of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. Furthermore, the Universal House of Justice had not yet been elected, which represented the only Bah√° º√≠ institution authorized to adjudicate on matters not covered by the religion's three central figures. The Hands of the Cause of God elected from among their own nine individuals who would serve as Custodians to help lead the transition of the International Bah√° º√≠ Council, whose members had previously been appointed by Shoghi Effendi, into the Universal House of Justice, whose members are elected by all the members of each Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly in the world. On April 8, 1960, Mason Remey one of the Hands of the Cause and president of the International Bah√° º√≠ Council, issued a written announcement claiming that he was the second Guardian of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. He based his claim on the idea that by appointing him as President of the International Bah√° º√≠ Council, the embryonic form of the Universal House of Justice which would be led by the Guardian, Shoghi Effendi had in fact implicitly named him as the second Guardian. Mason Remey's claim was largely rejected with several notable exceptions, including five members of the National Spiritual Assembly of France led by Joel Marangella. The remaining 26 Hands of the Cause unanimously declared Remey and whoever followed him Covenant-breakers. The Universal House of Justice later announced that it could not legislate to make possible the appointment of a successor Guardian to Shoghi Effendi. The Universal House of Justice also determined that it could not appoint any further Hands of the Cause, whose work is now carried out by other appointed institutions such as the Continental Counsellors and the Auxiliary Boards.

Description  Eucalyptus acroleuca is a tree that grows to a height of up to with hard black or dark grey, tessellated bark for the lowest of its trunk. The upper bark is smooth, white and shed annually. Adult leaves are lance- shaped, long and wide with a petiole long. The flowers are arranged in groups of up to seven on a thin, cylindrical peduncle up to long, individual flowers on a cylindrical pedicel long. The buds are oval to club-shaped, long and wide at maturity. The operculum is hemispherical, about half as long as the flower cup. The fruit is a cup-shaped capsule, long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus acroleuca was first formally described in 1994 by Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill from a specimen collected near the New Laura Homestead. The specific epithet (acroleuca) is derived from the Ancient Greek words acros meaning \\"highest\\" and leucos meaning \\"white\\", referring to the white bark on the higher branches of this species. Distribution and habitat This tree often grows in pure stands in woodland in heavy soils that are flooded in the wet season, and often grows near permanent lagoons.

He was a Social Democrat and was born in Pisarovo, Pleven Province.  Early life  Dertliev was educated as a doctor. He graduated in medicine in 1941. He was briefly an assistant in the Department of Anatomy at the Medical Faculty of Sofia University.  Career  His career was marked by political persecution exercised against him. From 1957 to 1963, he worked in the TB- dispensary for children in Tryavna and Pernik. From then until his retirement in 1984 he was head of the fluorographic department of the Institute of Tuberculosis at the Medical College. Dertliev was, in his own words, more of a \\"social democrat than a teenager\\". He participated in strikes and held political stands. He was first arrested in 1936 during a student protest for restoration of the Tarnovo Constitution. He was repeatedly arrested for opposition activities against the regime established after 1934. In 1938 he came under investigation for illegally printing and distributing materials during elections. On 9 September 1944, he became a member of the Committee of the Fatherland Front at Sofia University and the Medical Faculty. He was a secretary of the Union of Socialist Youth. In 1946, he was sent to Camp \\"Rosica\\" for opposition activities against the regime. That same year he was elected to parliament in the Grand National Assembly. In 1948, his parliamentary immunity was revoked and Dertliev was sentenced to ten years in prison \\"for counter-revolutionary activities\\". He was imprisoned in Venchan and Belene (2-fold), Pleven Prison, criminal division and in jail for repeat offenders in Pazardzhik.  Post-liberation  After the political changes of 1989, Dertliev, together with Atanas Moskov, initiated the reconstruction of the Party of Bulgarian Social Democrats (BSDP). After the Moskov's brief presidency (1989‚Äì1990), in 1990 Dertliev became chair of BSDP. In the Bulgarian presidential election, July‚ÄìAugust 1990, he attempted to become a presidential candidate, but Bulgarian Socialist Party BSP did not accept the nomination on the ground that he was ultimately anti-communist. Although Dertliev signed the new Constitution he disagreed with the position of the 39 MPs and left the parliament. He left BSDP and UDF in 1991 and tried to create a political center, an alternative to BSP and UDF. He attempted to attract former members of BSP / SDK from \\"Europe\\". He tried to form a strong social- democratic core around which to unite the political center. He largely achieved this with the establishment of the Council for Cooperation with the participation of the Alternative Social Liberal Party, Civil Alliance for the Republic, the Green Party, PK Ecoglastnost and others. In 1994 he was the first chairman of the rotation of Political Union Democratic Alternative for the Republic (DAR). Dertliev wrote two autobiographical books, one of which is This is me ‚Äì speeches, articles and interviews. He retired from active political activity in 1998, remaining chonorary chairman of BSDP. Despite poor health, he continued to deal with political problems. He died of cancer on 5 November 2000 in Sofia.

Biography Ion Vinokur was born to a Jewish family in Ryzhyn (Zhytomyr oblast, Ukraine). His father Srul (Israel) Gershkovich was a carpenter and his mother Maria Haimovna was a housewife. In 1936 the family moved to a bigger city Zhytomyr in order to give kids good education. Ion had a 4 years older sister Genya. During the World War II the family escaped to Ashgabad (Turkmenistan), where Ion Vinokur had spent the time between 1941 and 1944. Having returned to Zhytomyr after the war, Ion Vinokur started his university education on historical faculty of Chernivtsy State University named after Yurii Fedkovich. There he met Boris Tymoshchuk, renown archeologist and museum worker, who had played an important role in the choice of the future path for young Ion and strengthened his interest in archaeology.Ion Vinokur: podvizhnytstvo v osviti ta nautsi: naukovo-dokumental'ne ta bibliografichne vydannya / Kamyanets-Podilskiy natsionalniy universitet / editors O.M. Zavalnuyk, V. S. Prokopchuk, O. B. Komarnitskiy. - Kamyanets-Podilskiy, Aksioma, 2010. - 228 pages. In 1953, having graduated from the University, he returned to Zhytomyr, where he had worked in the regional historical museum and had been organising historical events and archaeological excavations. At this period of time Ion Vinokur had published his first articles and had lectured on archaeology as invited lecturer at the city's University. In 1957, Ion Vinokur returned to Chernivtsy University as head of the University's museum and lecturer of the course on museum management. In 1962 at the age of 32 he got his PhD in historical science from Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of USSR in Leningrad (St. Petersburg). His first book had been published the same year. In early 1963, Ion Vinokur moved to Kamyanets-Podilskiy where he had been working for 42 years at the Kamyanets-Podilskiy State University, the majority of the time as head of the faculty of history of Slavs and special historical disciplines. In 1963 Ion Vinokur had founded the annual excavation practice, that had turned into the serious systemic activity in the region, which had not been the case before and which has been lasting for the 50 years now. In the 1960s Ion Vinokur had been studying settlements and graves of the Chernyakhiv culture, in the 1970s he had focussed on the famous Bakota mentioned in ancient Slavic records and had discovered transitional settlements from Chernyakhiv culture to early Eastern Slavs. This research proved that despite opinions of some scientists there had been no break between the population continuity in the Dnipro-Dnister area (beds of two big rivers Dnipro (Dnepr) and Dnistro (Dnestr) and Chernyakhiv culture evolved into the early Eastern Slavic one. In 1978, Ion Vinokur defended his Professor's thesis devoted to the history of Chernyakhiv culture. In 1980 he got the Professor title. Further years had been devoted to the excavations and a unique discovery that has a meaning for the overall European history - the first Slavic jewelry workshop. Based on this research a further book on Slavic Jewelry has been published in 1997. In the further years Ion Vinokur had been continuing active academic and excavation work, including publication of the widely used in Ukraine school book on Ancient and Middle Ages history of Ukraine. In 2000s Ion Vinokur studied Gubyn - one more famous city mentioned in Slavic records and connected to the Bolokhiv culture. In 1997 he was elected as Academician. His last years he had spent with Slavistic University in Kyiv as head of ethnographic faculty. Ion Vinokur had founded a number of important organisations and associations devoted to ancient history and archaeology, including Ukrainian national ethnographic association. He had been actively taking part in the development of the next generation of archaeologists and historians, by overseeing numerous PhD students and being the member of the Committee granting scientific titles at Institute of Archaeology of Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. He had played a vital role in gaining the status of Historical Heritage for Kamyanets-Podilskiy. Ion Vinokur had been actively speaking at numerous scientific events including international ones. His works had been published in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Krakow, Lublin, Sofia and Berlin. He died in 2006 at Kyiv, Ukraine.

It protects the land around the mouth of the Frades River. There is pressure, or opportunity, to develop the reserve for tourism. Location The Rio dos Frades Wildlife Refuge is in the municipality of Porto Seguro, Bahia. It has an area of . Nearby conservation units include the Pau Brasil National Park to the north, and the Monte Pascoal National Park and Corumbau Marine Extractive Reserve to the south. The reserve is within the Cara√≠va-Trancoso State Environmental Protection Area, defined on 24 November 2000. The reserve has a buffer zone of . Environment The reserve is on a sandy coastal plain bounded by a cliff inland. It is in the drainage basin of the Frades River, and protects the mouth of the river. Average annual rainfall is . The vegetation is mainly restinga salt marsh, with shrubs and thickets. There are mangroves and many bromeliads and orchids. There is an endemic lizard named Cnemidophorus nativo. The reserve is threatened by construction on private properties, which cover most of the reserve, and by Buffalo incursions. Tourism is being developed in the region, and the small beach at the river mouth may be attractive. Tourism has potential economic value for the local residents. The local people of Itaporanga use the reserve to access the beach and the river mouth for leisure and for fishing. History On 15 May 2006 the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) began public consultations on the proposed creation of the Rio dos Frades and Una wildlife refuges, as well as the proposed expansion of the Pau-Brazil and Descobrimento national parks and of the Una Biological Reserve. The Rio dos Frades Wildlife Refuge was created by federal decree on 21 December 2007 with the basic objective of preserving natural ecosystems of great ecological relevance and scenic beauty, enabling scientific research, education and environmental interpretation and supporting recreation in contact with nature. It is classed as IUCN protected area category III (natural monument or feature). It is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation. It became part of the Central Atlantic Forest Ecological Corridor, created in 2002. The consultative council was created on 21 July 2011. The consultative council included representatives of ICMBio and landowners, but the landowners were not actively participating due to lack of interest. As of 2014 the reserve had no management plan and was therefore not open to visitors.
