It is a shrub with cylindrical, hairy branches, narrow egg-shaped leaves with the narrower end towards the base, and purple to pale lilac flowers. Description Prostanthera clotteniana is an erect shrub that typically grows to a height of with hairy, stems. The leaves are narrow elliptic to narrow egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, dull green, long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers are arranged singly in two to four leaf axils near the ends of branchlet, each flower with bracteoles long near the base of the sepals. The sepals form a tube long with two lobes, the lower lobe long and the upper lobe long. The petals are purple to pale lilac, long and fused to form a tube long, the lower central lobe long and bilobed. The lower side lobes are long and the upper lobes are long and fused with a small central notch. Taxonomy In 1904, Frederick Manson Bailey formally described Hemigenia clotteniana in the Queensland Agricultural Journal and in 1905 described Prostanthera atroviolacea in the same journal, specimens of both plants collected near Herberton. In 2000, Anthony Bean considered the two names to be synonyms and raised the new name Prostanthera clotteniana in the journal Austrobaileya. The species was named \\"after F. E. Clotten, who furnished the funds for printing a general index to ‚ÄúThe Queensland Flora‚Äù\\". Queensland Agricultural Journal. volume 15. page 493. 1904. Distribution and habitat Prostanthera clotteniana grows in dry woodland on steep, rocky slopes in the Ravenshoe‚ÄìAtherton area of north-east Queensland where it is only known from seven sites. It was thought to be extinct until rediscovered in 1999. Conservation status This species is classified as \\"critically endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992. The main threats to the species are inappropriate fire regimes and habitat disturbance caused by mining, illegal collection and weed invasion.

Founded in 1978, its membership is largely composed of Hebrew-speaking Israeli expatriates. Started as a basement minyan, the congregation purchased a small home in the 1980s, which was subsequently destroyed by arson in 2000. With significant funding from the Philadelphia Jewish community, the building was restored. The synagogue was further expanded with a larger sanctuary and a social hall, completed in 2011. Name The congregation is named in honor of Maimonides, a 12th-century Sephardi scholar, philosopher, and halakhic decisor known by the acronym of his name, Rav Moshe Ben Maimon, as the Rambam. History Beit Harambam Congregation was founded in 1978 as a Sephardi minyan by Rabbi Amiram Gabay in the basement of his house in the Rhawnhurst neighborhood of Northeast Philadelphia. Gabay is a long-time owner of a Judaica gift shop and art gallery in Philadelphia and also serves as a police chaplain. A native of Morocco who had lived briefly in Israel, Gabay sought to provide a place of prayer for Hebrew-speaking Israeli expatriates in the community. The congregation grew gradually, and members were able to buy a small house in which to hold services in the late 1980s. The furnishings, collected over time, included a simple wooden Torah ark, a long table and chairs for study sessions, and an assortment of bookshelves. By 2000, the congregation had 300 members. In 2013, an estimated 250 to 300 individuals were active in the synagogue. As of 2013, Beit Harambam Congregation was the larger of two Sephardi synagogues in Northeast Philadelphia. Arson attack On Shabbat, May 27, 2000, worshippers arriving for morning prayers found the synagogue gutted by fire. According to police, an arsonist had gained access to the interior through a back window, gathered up all the prayer books in a pile, and put a match to them. The fire was lit at around 4:20 a.m. The arsonist dropped two charity boxes in the yard during his escape. Besides fire damage to the interior, half of the roof fell down. Firemen excavated four Torah scrolls which were \\"likely damaged beyond repair by smoke and water\\", and all of the synagogue's prayer books were rendered unusable. Fifty prayer shawls were also destroyed. The damaged Torah scrolls, prayer shawls, and other ritual objects were formally buried in August on the solemn mourning day of Tisha B'Av. Police posted a $10,000 reward for identification of the perpetrator, but no one was ever arrested. The synagogue immediately began receiving support and funding from local and national groups and individuals. The American Jewish Congress donated $3,000 in June, which was earmarked for the purchase of new bibles and prayer books. The congregation received significant funding from the Philadelphia Jewish community, including the Jewish Federal of Greater Philadelphia, to rebuild. By 2002, the building had been restored. With the growth of membership and activities, however, the congregation sought to expand its space. After a multi-year rezoning effort, the synagogue received the go-ahead to build a larger sanctuary and a social hall. As many members were skilled contractors or had jobs in the construction industry, they contributed their time and labor to the project. The expansion was completed in 2011 and was dedicated in 2012 in a ceremony attended by then-Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel Shlomo Amar. Other incidents Nearly a year after the fire, vandalism was discovered on the synagogue's interior walls‚Äîincluding \\"swastikas, obscenities and dollar signs\\". The synagogue was in the process of reconstruction and members were conducting services in a rented storefront. Leadership Rabbi Amiram Gabay has led the congregation since its founding. His son, Eli Gabay, serves as president of the congregation. In 2009, Rabbi Moshe Haim Arbiv was hired as assistant rabbi to help cultivate new members. Arbiv and his wife Leah had been doing outreach work with Israelis living in Philadelphia for several years through the Shehebar Sephardic Center of Jerusalem. Synagogue activities Beit Harambam Congregation is an Orthodox synagogue. The prayer service follows the nusach of Edot HaMizrach. The synagogue offers daily study sessions for men, weekly Tehillim groups for women, and classes and activities for children. Assistant rabbi Moshe Haim Arbiv leads classes at 5:30 a.m. before morning prayers and also after evening prayers. Arbiv and his wife Leah have also introduced pre- holiday workshops, holiday parties, and social events both in the synagogue and in neighborhood parks. The Arbivs were involved in the successful installation of an eruv for the community, and have also launched social services such as a gemach (free-loan society), meals for the sick, and help for new mothers. Membership As of 2019, the majority of members are Hebrew-speaking Israeli expatriates. Most members are of Mizrahi descent, although some are Ashkenazi. According to a 2000 article in The Philadelphia Inquirer, there were no membership dues and the leadership of the congregation did not receive a salary.

That is, any compound with formula HO(O=)C‚Äì‚ÄìCH=CH‚Äì‚ÄìCH=CH‚Äì‚ÄìH where x, y, and z can be zero or more, and x+y+z = 5 (72 isomers); or HO(O=)C‚Äì‚ÄìCH=C=CH‚Äì‚ÄìH where r + s = 6 (15 isomers). All these compounds have the formula . A salt or ester of such an acid is called a decadienoate. These compounds are unsaturated fatty acids, although they are rarely found in natural lipids (fats, waxes, phospholipids, etc.). Isomers=Positional isomerism The various decadienoic acid isomers can be distinguished by the positions of their double bonds along the chain. A double bond is said to be at position k if it connects carbons k and k+1 of the chain, counting from 1 at the carboxyl end. The positions are x+2 and x+y+4 for the first type (21 possibilities), and r+2 and r+3 for the second type (7 possibilities). The systematic name of the acid is formed by prefixing the positions of the double bonds to \\"decadienoic\\" or inserting them before the \\"dienoic\\" suffix. as in \\"4,7-decadienoic\\" or \\"dec-4,7-dienoic\\" for HO(O=)C‚Äì‚ÄìCH=CH‚Äì‚ÄìCH=CH‚Äì‚ÄìH. Geometric isomerism Decadienoic acids with the two double bonds in the same positions can be further distinguished by the geometry of the adjacent single bonds. Each double bond that is adjacent to two single C‚ÄìC bonds can be in two cis-trans conformations, namely with those two single bonds on the same side (cis or Z) or opposite sides (trans or E) of the double bond's plane. If the two double bonds overlap forming an allene core C=C=C surrounded by two single C‚ÄìC bonds, the chain fragments C‚ÄìC=C=C and C=C=C‚ÄìC will lie on perpendicular planes. Then, instead of cis-trans isomers, there will be two axial isomers distinguished by the handedness of the C‚ÄìC=C=C‚ÄìC \\"screw\\". They are denoted by the letters R and S. Double bonds at the very end of the chain (‚ÄìC=C or -C=C=C) will not cause geometric isomerism, because the two hydrogen atoms in the final carbon are symmetrically placed relative to the bond's plane. However, geometric isomerism may still occur at that position in derivative compounds where one or both terminal hydrogens are replaced by different groups. Geometric isomerism raises the number of decadienoic acids with separate double bonds from 21 to 72, and of those with an allene core from 6 to 11. Examples Docadienoic acids that have received some attention include: * trans-2-cis-4-decadienoic acid, (2E,4Z) deca-2,4-dienoic acid (CAS 30361-33-2, Nikkaji J88.660B). It is about 8% of the fatty acids (per mole) of stillingia oil. The methyl ester is a flavoring agent (FEMA The propyl ester (CAS 3025-32-9, Nikkaji J309.441C, FDA D07SW1IHHP) is present in some extracts. . * deca-(2E,4Z)-dienoic acid (CAS 544-48-9) The propyl ester (CAS 28316-62-3, FDA 2EEE2O3TE8) is a flavoring agent. The butyl ester (CAS 28369-24-6) is a flavor/fragrance agent. The ethyl ester (CAS 3025-30-7, Beilstein 1724176) is source of aroma of Bartlett pears; also present in fresh apple, Vitis sp., quince and Strychnos madagascariensis * deca-(2Z,4E)-dienoic acid (CAS 68676-77-7, Nikkaji J703.053C). * deca-(2Z,4Z)-dienoic acid. Propyl ester (CAS ??) * deca-4,8-dienoic acid (CAS 13159-49-4) Unspecified isomers present in some flavor extracts. =Derivatives= Some derivatives of interest are: See also * Decanoic acid, fully saturated, * Decenoic acid, mono-unsaturated, References Perflavory (2020): \\"deca-(2E,4E)-dienoic acid\\".

Geography Kildallan North is bounded on the north by Ballyhug townland, on the west by Balroe, Cartron and Kill townlands and on the east by Kildallan, Westmeath and Sonna Demesne townlands. Its chief geographical features are a hill which reaches a height of 285 feet, woods, the Mill River (which flows north into the River Inny (Leinster)) and small streams. Kildallan North is traversed by the R393 road (Ireland) and minor lanes. The townland covers 253 acres. Etymology The Down Survey map of 1655 spells the name as Killdolan, Kildolan and lists the owner as Sir Oliver Tuite. Kildallan North was not then a separate townland and formed part of Kildallan. it was not separated until the Ordnance Survey of 1836. William Petty's map of 1685 depicts it as Killdellan. History The townland was named after the Ollamh √ârenn or Chief Poet of Ireland, Dall√°n Forgaill, who composed the \\"Amhra Coluim Cille\\" a panegyric on Saint Columba in c.597 in Portloman townland, which is located two townlands to the east of Kildallan North. Dallan was not a member of the clergy so he probably donated the townland to the church. In medieval times the land was owned by the O'Casey or O'Cathasaigh clan of Saithne (now called Sonna). The Annals of the Four Masters contain several references to them under the years 1018, 1023, 1086, 1140, 1146, 1153, 1160, 1171, 1179, etc. At the time of the Norman Invasion of Ireland, King Henry II of England granted to Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath, the lands of √ì Maoilsheachlainn, king of Meath in return for the service of 50 Knights. As one of de Lacy's barons, Riste√°rd de Ti√∫it received large grants in Westmeath and Longford. His descendants became the barons of Moyashell, in Westmeath. De Lacy conferred on the Tuite family the castle of O'Casey (Irish √ì Cathasaigh), chief of Saithne, now Sonna in Westmeath. This senior branch of the family became Protestant in order to hold on to their lands and remained on the lands until they moved to Britain in the 1920s. Pender's Census of 1659 states there were 8 people aged over 15 in the townland, all of English extraction, (In general the percentage of the Irish population aged under 15 runs at about 20% so the total population of Kildallan in 1659 would have been roughly about 10). An Inquisition held at Mullingar on 4 April 1665 spells the name Kildolan and traces the ownership of the townland from the early 17th century. A further Inquisition held at Kilbegan on 26 August 1679 spells the name Killdolan and traces the ownership of the townland from the early 17th century. A map published c.1770 spells the name as Killdollan and depicts the holding of each tenant in the townland. The Tithe Applotment Books of 1833 spell the name as Kildollan. Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists 3 landholders in the townland. The townland remained in the ownership of the Tuite family down to the 20th century. A Chancery decree dated 30 June 1873 spells the name as Kildollan North. The book Hibernia Venatica by Maurice O'Connor Morris published in 1878 describes a fox hunt through Kildollan Gorse. In the 1901 census of Ireland, there were three families listed in the townland. In the 1911 census of Ireland, there were two families listed in the townland. A description of Kildallan in 1938 is viewable on the D√∫chas website. Antiquities # In 1836 there was a Corn Mill, Tuck Mill, Mill Pond and Corn Kiln located in the townland. The precise location of a medieval mill on the border of Kildallan North and Sonna Demesne has not been identified. The Corn Mill and Tuck Mill depicted on the 1837 ed. OS 6-inch map located on the townland boundary may be the site of the mill mentioned in the terrier of the 1655-9 Down Survey map of Templeoran parish. The terrier states that a Rivolett passeth through it through the Towne of Kildolan and Sonnagh on which Standeth a mill belonging to Sonnagh. This location described in the Down Survey matches very closely the location of the Corn and Tuck Mill depicted on the 1837 ed. OS 6-inch map. The 1770 map also shows the mill located in Kildallan North. # A sheepfold ReferencesExternal links * The IreAtlas Townland Data Base Category:County Westmeath Category:Townlands of County Westmeath ","title":"Kildallan North"},{"id":"65123472","text":"Michele A.

'This is just step one in a process of making sure that we're elevating their voice', DeWolf said towards the end of last week's meeting. 'I think that we have ‚Ä¶ an opportunity to have a really critical relationship with them in helping us to make sure that we're held accountable and also doing things in the best interest of our students of color and historically marginalized populations.'\\" In July 2020, DeWolf led the Seattle School Board in passing a resolution requiring LGBTQ+ affirming curriculum and gender-neutral restroom facilities, and requiring one Seattle school be renamed after an LGBTQ+ leader.

Writing about gardens takes a variety of literary forms, ranging from instructional manuals on horticulture and garden design, to essays on gardening, to novels. Garden writing has been published in English since at least the 16th century.  Classification  Atkinson suggests a two-part division of garden writing, at least in the 19th century. On the one hand, she notes, some garden writers produced utilitarian guides on garden maintenance and horticulture. On the other hand, garden writing also included higher-brow works on the \\"pleasures of landscape aesthetics\\".  Early history  Published writing about gardens in English dates back at least to the mid-16th century. The first version of Thomas Tusser's poem Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry was published in 1557, and William Lawson's The Country Housewife's Garden followed in 1608. In France, Antoine-Joseph D√©zallier d'Argenville first published La th√©orie et la pratique du jardinage () in 1709. It had been translated into English by 1728.  19th century  Colour plate from Some English Gardens (1904) by Gertrude Jekyll. The Victorian era in the United Kingdom saw significant changes in gardening practices, fuelled by new technologies such as the invention of the lawn mower and imports of exotic plants from the far reaches of the Empire. Garden writing, particularly in magazines, grew in prominence along with these developments, driven in part by middle class gardeners in suburban developments keen to make good use of their land. In Britain, designer and scholar Gertrude Jekyll published widely on gardening. Jane and her husband John Claudius Loudon, both botanists, worked together on a number of treatises concerning horticulture, including several encyclopedias on the subject. John Loudon also edited the The Gardener's Magazine, which brought information and commentary on gardens to a popular audience. Andrew Jackson Downing's magazine The Horticulturist was an analogue of Loudon's Gardener's Magazine in the United States. Seaton describes Henry Arthur Bright's A Year in a Lancashire Garden (1879) as a \\"garden autobiograph[y]\\", noting that it is structured like a series of diary entries as opposed to a treatise or reference work. Atkinson argues that Charles Dudley Warner's memoir My Summer in a Garden (1871) is a foundational work of garden writing in American letters.  20th and 21st centuries  In early 20th century America, garden writing targeted at amateur gardeners frequently appeared in the popular press during what Clayton calls the \\"golden age of magazines\\". Jamaica Kincaid, a novelist, gardener, and garden writer, has published a number of works on gardens. Her My Garden (Book) (1999) uses gardens as a lens to explore diverse themes including colonialism while providing advice and instruction on garden management.

He was the son of Jan van den Eynde, and the father of Elizabeth van den Eynde, Princess of Belvedere and Baroness of Gallicchio and Missanello, and Jane (Giovanna) van den Eynde, Princess of Galatro and Sonnino. He should not be confused with his namesake and uncle Ferdinand van den Eynde. Family Van den Eynde was born in the mid-17th century in Naples. He was the son of Jan van den Eynde, an extremely wealthy Flemish merchant who had become one of the richest men in Naples through trading and banking. Jan van den Eynde was also one of the most prominent figures in 17th-century Naples, as well as the owner of the largest art collection in the Napoletano. Jan was brother to Ferdinand van den Eynde, who was buried in 1630 in the church of Santa Maria dell'Anima in Rome. Life Van den Eynde was probably born in Naples in the mid-17th century. The Van den Eynde were related to notable Netherlandish artists such as Brueghel, Jode, and Lucas and Cornelis de Wael. Lucas and Cornelis de Wael were nephews of his father Jan. His father Jan acquired the Palazzo Zevallos Stigliano in 1653, as well as a peerage for his son Ferdinand. Upon his father death, Marquess Ferdinand restructured the Palazzo Zevallos, and, between 1671 and 1674, built the monumental Villa Carafa of Belvedere in Vomero, which today is the most historical villa in Vomero and one of the best known villas in Naples. When Gaspar Roomer, who had been both his and his father's friend and business partner, died in 1674, he bequeathed to Van den Eynde his own collection of paintings, composed of 70 or 90 pieces which included paintings by Peter Paul Rubens and Luca Giordano, further enlarging Van den Eynde's collection. Giordano was a friend of Van den Eynde, and, upon the latter's death, he drew up himself the inventory for Van den Eynde's inheritance(Giordano counted ten paintings by himself in Van den Eynde's collection at that time). However, Van den Eynde died of consumption the same year, and his huge collection passed to his daughters, Elizabeth and Jane (Giovanna). Van den Eynde's daughters, Giovanna and Elizabeth, married the heirs of two of the most powerful Italian families, the Colonna and the Carafa. Giovanna married Giuliano Colonna, 1st Prince of Sonnino and Galatro, while Elizabeth married Carlo Carafa, 3rd Principe of Belvedere, 6th Marquess of Anzi and Lord of Trivigno.

Born in 1859 in the village of Badalona. He was an important landowner whose lands were next to stream of Canyet, in the current neighbourhood of Bufal√†. His manor house was known as Can Martinet Pujol. He was one of the founders of the Foment de l'Agricultura in 1884, a local agrarian association appeared during the plague of the phylloxera which seriously affected and destructed many vineyards. He participated in local politics, as a catalanist and militant of the Regionalist League of Catalonia. In 1892 he was representative for Badalona in the assembly that wrote Bases de Manresa. After a political and admnistrative period of chaos in the city council because of caciquism, in 1905 he was elected councilor along other members of their political candidacy formed in 1899, linked to a catalanist local center named Gent Nova. He was mayor from 1906 to 1910. During his term were created different public institutions like Casa Empar for orphans, or a School of Agriculture, Arts and Jobs. There were also urbanistic reforms, the most important was the urbanitzation of the Canyet stream, for which he ceded an important amount of land.

Construction The convention center project was conceptualized by then-Senator Aquilino Pimentel, Jr. at the start of his term in 1998. Construction of the facility began on June 30, 2001 and was projected to be complete in August 2003. However the construction of the convention center was stalled in multiple occasions. During the administration of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, there was difficulty in securing funds for the project. Pimentel alleged that Arroyo was blocking the release of funds for projects initiated by legislators belonging to the opposition including the convention center project. The former senator had suggested naming the facility after Arroyo's father Diosdado Macapagal, due to her parent also being a former president, in a bid to secure her support for the project. By November 2009, only 45 percent of the project was completed. Another setback was experienced in 2012 due to an ownership dispute over the site of the facility which was only resolved in late 2016. Construction work on the main building started in February 2018. By July 2019, the convention center is already 56 percent complete; with the main building 88 percent finished. Pimentel has proposed the site to be named after Pablo P. Magtajas who was mayor of Cagayan de Oro from 1984 to 1998. Facilities The CDO Convention Center's main building covers an area of and has a spectator capacity of 7,700 while it could host additional 700 people through its function rooms. The building complex will also host a dedicated building that will house offices of the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (TIEZA), a multistory car park building, a viewing deck, a helipad, a pavilion, and administrative building among other facilities.

Its historical and administrative center is the town of Saint-Fargeau. Its inhabitants are known as Poyaudins (or Puisayens). Name According to local 19th-century historian , the name Puisaye first appeared in 12th-century charters. It was variously spelled Poiseia, Puseium, Pusaya, Puiseia, Puteacia, or Poidaceia. Geography Since the Puisaye is not an administrative region, its exact definition and limits can vary depending on time and context. Its core is a land of forests and ponds, traversed by several rivers including the Loing. It is bordered by Sancerrois to the west across the Loire river, G√¢tinais to the northwest, Auxerrois to the northeast, Forterre to the southeast, and Donziais to the south. The , created in 2017, covers most of the historical Puisaye, though not its Western fringe in the Loiret. It also includes the geologically distinct land of Forterre as well as parts of the Auxerrois, both to the east. The name Puisaye appears to exert a certain attraction, leading communities that are not historically part of Puisaye to adopt it. This has been the case of Soug√®res-en-Puisaye, which changed its name from Soug√®res-les-Simon in 1955, and of Charny-Or√©e-de-Puisaye, which adopted this name when it was formed by the merger of 14 villages in 2016. As a result, the contemporary usage of the word Puisaye can cover a broader territory than has been the case in the past. The Lac du Bourdon is the largest body of water in Puisaye, albeit far from the only one. It is a reservoir formed in 1901 to help regulate water levels of the Briare Canal. The Bourdon is a small tributary of the Loing that feeds into and from the lake. History The territory of Puisaye was christianized in late antiquity. Some villages are traditionally associated with late-Antiquity saints, e.g. in Saints-en-Puisaye. A Carolingian manuscript lists several Puisaye parishes on the itinerary of Saint Aunarius, Bishop of Auxerre in the late 6th century, namely Neuvy-sur- Loire (Novus Vicus), Briare (Brioderus), Bl√©neau (Blanoilus), Bitry (Vitriacus), and Arquian (Arcuncius), and also refers to Toucy (Tociacus). The lordship of Toucy was prominent in the High Middle Ages, as several of its leaders and family affiliates played significant roles, not least as associates of the House of Courtenay in their overseas endeavors. Meanwhile, the south of the Puisaye was in the orbit of the County of Nevers and specifically of the Barony of Donzy. The crisis of the late Middle Ages and specifically the Hundred Years' War marked a rupture in the history of the region. Toucy was devastated in the runup to the Battle of Cravant, and was subsequently displaced by Saint-Fargeau as the main urban center of the Puisaye. Antoine de Chabannes significantly developed Saint-Fargeau, reconstructing its castle but also founding a hospital there. Generally, the century between 1450 and 1550 was a time of prosperity and renewal in the region, still represented in the landscape by numerous village churches built during that era. This period of prosperity ended with the Wars of Religion and troubles of the early 17th century. Former province of Orl√©anais in the 18th century, with Puisaye to the far east By the end of France's Ancien R√©gime, the core of Puisaye including Bl√©neau, Saint-Fargeau, Toucy and Saint-Sauveur was part of the province of Orl√©anais. It was a provincial borderland, with parts of the present communaut√© de communes de Puisaye-Forterre in Champagne (e.g. Charny), Burgundy (e.g. Pourrain, Courson-les-Carri√®res), and Nivernais (e.g. Saint-V√©rain). Moreover, √éle-de-France (e.g. Courtenay) was close by to the north, and Berry just across the Loire river. Lordship of Puisaye The Lordship of Puisaye is attested under that name from the late 13th century to the late 16th century, corresponding to an area that varied across time but generally included the towns of Bl√©neau, M√©zilles, Saint-Fargeau, and until the early 16th century, Toucy. The lordship of Puisaye was inherited by the Counts, then Dukes of Bar following the 1255 marriage between Theobald II, Count of Bar and Joanna of Toucy, heiress of a lineage that started with Ythier de Narbonne in the 11th century (). On Joanna of Toucy's death in 1317 the lordship went to Edward I, Count of Bar and then to his son Henry IV, Count of Bar, and grandson, Robert, Duke of Bar. One of Robert's sons, John of Bar, inherited the lordship (but not the Duchy of Bar) when Robert died in 1411, but he was himself soon killed at the Battle of Agincourt in October 1415. The Lordship of Puisaye was then seized, together with the Duchy (whose ruler Edward III was also killed in Agincourt) by Cardinal Louis of Bar, brother of John and Edward and a significant political figure of the era. On Louis's death the lordship of Puisaye went to John Jacob, Marquis of Montferrat, son of Marquis Theodore II who had married Louis's sister Joanna. John Jacob sold parts of the lordship to Georges de La Tr√©moille, but he wasn't able or willing to pay and John Jacob's sons recovered them in the late 1440s. They in turn sold the entire lordship to Jacques Coeur in February 1450. After Jacques Coeur's downfall in 1451, the lordship was taken by Antoine de Chabannes. Charles VII's decision of 29 May 1453 specifically granted him: \\"(1) the lands, castles and lordships of Saint-Fargeau, of Lavau, of La Couldre, of Perreuse, of Champignelles, of M√©zilles, or Villeneuve-les- Gen√™ts and their dependencies; (2) the lands of Saint-Maurice-sur-Aveyron, Melleroy, La Frenaie, Fontenelles, and their dependencies; (3) the Barony of Toucy with its belongings and dependencies.\\" Jacques Coeur's family sued, but eventually the Chabannes were able to keep their Puisaye domains. After the death of Antoine's son John of Chabannes in 1503, the lordship was divided between his two young daughters. Antoinette (1498-ca. 1527) received most of Puisaye including Saint-Fargeau. In 1515 she married Ren√© d'Anjou-M√©zi√®res (1483-1521) who thus became lord of Puisaye as later was his son Nicolas (1518-1569). These domains later went to Fran√ßois, Duke of Montpensier following his 1566 marriage with , daughter of Nicolas d'Anjou. John of Chabannes's elder daughter Avoye (1492-ca. 1545) kept other Chabannes domains including Toucy, and in 1504 she married Aymon du Prie (or Prye). The latter's family kept the Barony of Toucy following Aymon's death in 1510. In 1575, King Henry III elevated the County of Saint-Fargeau to a Duch√©-Pairie. After that, the reference to Puisaye as a lordship or political entity, which had already been infrequent under Nicolas d'Anjou, appears to fade away. In the archives of the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Fargeau, however, there are references to the \\"duch√© de Saint-Fargeau et de Puisaye\\" in a document from 1606 and \\"duch√© de Saint- Fargeau et du pa√Øs de Puisaie\\" in another one from 1714.

Completed and commissioned in 1943, she served in World War II, operating in support of Japanese forces in the Battle of Tarawa before she was sunk in November 1943. Construction and commissioning I-39 was laid down on 19 June 1941 by at the Sasebo Navy Yard at Sasebo, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 152. Renamed I-39 by the time she was launched on 15 April 1942 and provisionally attached to the Yokosuka Naval District that day, she was completed and commissioned on 22 April 1943. Service history Upon commissioning, I-39 was attached formally to the Yokosuka Naval District and assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for work-ups. With those completed, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 14 in Submarine Squadron 8 in the Submarine Advance Force on 20 July 1943. She departed Yokosuka on 21 July 1943 and arrived at Truk on 27 July 1943. First war patrol On 2 August 1943, I-39 set out from Truk on her first war patrol, with a patrol area in the New Hebrides. She was depth-charged briefly by a destroyer north of Espiritu Santo on 7 August 1943, and on 29 August 1943 two destroyers sighted and pursued her, but she suffered no damage in either encounter. On 2 September 1943, I-39 sighted a convoy of three transports escorted by four destroyers. She fired two torpedoes, both of which exploded close astern of the attack transport , which was carrying the New Zealand Army‚Ä≤s 3rd Division from Port Vila on Efate to Point Cruz on Guadalcanal. A destroyer attempted a counterattack, but failed to locate I-39. On 10 September, I-39 sighted an unescorted transport heading toward Espiritu Santo at 09:50, but could not get within torpedo range of her. On 11 September I-39 sighted another unescorted transport east of Espiritu Santo at 05:05 and two transports escorted by a destroyer at 18:10, but made no attacks. I-39 was east of Espiritu Santo on 12 September 1943 when she sighted the United States Navy fleet tug towing the 6,600-ton gasoline barge YOGN-42 from Pago Pago in American Samoa to Espiritu Santo. Mistaking Navajo for a British light cruiser, she hit Navajo with a single torpedo amidships on her starboard side. Navajo exploded and sank by the bow in two minutes at with the loss of 17 members of her crew. While returning to Truk, I-39 suffered damage when she was depth-charged on 25 September 1943. She reached Truk on 27 September 1943 and underwent repairs there. Second war patrol The Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign began on 20 November 1943 with the U.S. invasion of Tarawa and of Makin in the Gilbert Islands. On 21 November 1943, I-39 received orders to proceed to Tarawa along with the submarines , , , and . With a Yokosuka E14Y1 (Allied reporting name \\"Glen\\") floatplane aboard, she got underway from Truk on her second war patrol that day, with an assigned patrol area southwest of Tarawa. She reported on 24 November 1943 that she was approaching her patrol area, and on 25 November ‚Äî the same day she was reassigned to Submarine Division 2 in Submarine Squadron 1 ‚Äî she reported that she had arrived in her patrol area. The Japanese never heard from her again. Loss On 26 November 1943, the battleship was steaming southwest of Tarawa as part of Task Group 50.2, when she detected a surface target to the southwest on radar at 22:52. At 23:02 the destroyer was detached to investigate. She detected a surfaced submarine on radar at 23:20 and closed with it. She lost radar contact, apparently when the submarine submerged, but Boyd then located the submarine with her sonar. She dropped two patterns of depth charges, and heard a loud underwater explosion 15 minutes after the last attack at . On the morning of 27 November 1943, planes from the aircraft carrier flew over the area and reported a large oil slick on the surface. It marked the end of a Japanese submarine. The submarine probably was I-39, although it is possible that Boyd sank , which also disappeared in the Tarawa area around the same time. An alternative account claims that the destroyer escort sank I-39 off Koli Point, Guadalcanal, on 23 December 1943, although that location lies outside I-39‚Ä≤s patrol area and the date is four weeks after she last transmitted a message, On 20 February 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared I-39 to be presumed lost with her entire crew of 96 in the Gilbert Islands area. She was stricken from the Navy list on 30 April 1944. NotesSources * Hackett, Bob & Kingsepp, Sander. IJN Submarine I-39: Tabular Record of Movement. Retrieved on August 26, 2020.

Since making her debut in 2015 she has been a member of the Republic of Ireland women's national team. Her younger brother Austin Gleeson has represented the Waterford county hurling team. Club career Gleeson was born in Waterford and played youth soccer for local clubs Villa AFC and Tramore AFC. She joined Wexford Youths for the inaugural Women's National League (WNL) season in 2011‚Äì12. In 2014‚Äì15 Wexford Youths won the WNL for the first time, and Gleeson represented the club in the 2015‚Äì16 UEFA Women's Champions League. Ahead of the 2018 WNL season, Gleeson accepted an offer to join Wexford Youths' WNL rivals Shelbourne FC. She had considered moving a year earlier, but decided to spend one more season at Wexford out of loyalty to the team's coach. International career=Youth In 2010, Gleeson was a key player in the Republic of Ireland U-17 squad who were runners-up in the 2010 UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship and quarter-finalists in the 2010 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. While enrolled at Waterford Institute of Technology, Gleeson represented Ireland at the 2013 and 2015 Summer Universiades. Senior Gleeson received her first Republic of Ireland national team call-up for the 2013 Cyprus Cup. In May 2015, Gleeson was called up to the senior national team again for a friendly in the United States. After the match had been arranged, it was discovered to be outside FIFA's designated dates for international matches, so several of Ireland's first-choice players were not released by their clubs. Gleeson started Ireland's 3‚Äì0 defeat to win a debut cap, but was substituted at half time after being concussed by Abby Wambach. Eight months later Gleeson collected a second cap, making a substitute appearance in another friendly defeat by the United States in San Diego. She retained her place in the squad for the 2016 Cyprus Cup and played in the opening 2‚Äì0 defeat by Austria, before succumbing to a foot injury which ruled her out of the remaining fixtures.

The episode was written by Dana Terrace and Rachel Vine, from a story by Zach Marcus, Molly Ostertag, John Bailey Owen, Terrace and Vine, and directed by Stephen Sandoval. \\"Young Blood, Old Souls\\" was first released on DisneyNow and video on demand on August 29, 2020 and aired later that same day on Disney Channel. It received a mixed reception from critics.  Plot  Luz Noceda prepares herself to rescue Eda with King joining her. King claims that magic was once wild, but that an unknown person arrived and claimed that he could \\"speak to the island\\" and created the coven system, resulting in him becoming the most powerful witch and became known as Emperor Belos. Witches who do not choose a coven are taken and petrified permanently. Lilith brings her sister Eda to Belos in hopes that he will remove her curse but he instead double crosses Lilith, orders Eda to be petrified and for Lilith to destroy Eda's palisman Owlbert. Luz and King purposefully get caught so that they can get into the castle. Luz finds Eda and manages to speak to her in her monster form. Eda tells her that Belos wants the key to the human world and that she needs to head home and destroy it. As she is taken away, Luz fights with Lilith and both end up in the human world. Lilith admits that cursing Eda was a mistake (she thought the curse would last a day) as she wanted to get into the Emperor's Coven, but that Eda was willing to give it up for her. After returning Owlbert to Luz unharmed as a sign of trust they head back to the boiling isles together to rescue Eda. Lilith plans to stay in the emperor's coven in order to spy on Belos but she and King are captured leaving Luz to confront Belos alone. Willow and Gus lead the people in cheering for Eda's release (the citizens doubted the reason for Eda's petrification). Luz, overpowered by Belos, is given the choice of giving up the key to the human world (Belos claiming he has no intentions on World domination and wants it for another propose) or have Eda suffer. Luz gives up the key, but burns it upon leaving. Luz, King and Lilith manage to rescue Eda and escape as Belos informs the citizens that Eda will be spared. Afterwards, Lilith uses her magic to share Eda's curse, resulting in Eda returning to normal, but both her and Lilith's magic having weakened. Afterwards, Luz makes a video message to her mother, promising that she will find a way back home. Meanwhile, Belos sends a masked figure to spy on the residents of the owl house and uses what was left of the key to make a portal to the human world. Production=Writing The first letters of the episode titles for season one spell out \\"A WITCH LOSES A TRUE WAY,\\" this episode being the \\"Y.\\" It was revealed in this episode to be in reference to Luz losing her one \\"true way\\" home when she destroys the portal.

Club's Kevin Johnson gave the episode a \\"B\\", stating the episode was an \\"enjoyable, tense, and intriguing finale\\" which also \\"inadvertently exposes the overall flaws\\" of the show. One such flaw Johnson felt was highlighted in this episode was the show's consistency with its depiction of magic, contrasting it to shows like Steven Universe and Gravity Falls which \\"really put in the work to make details cohere so that the overall world and premise stand out\\" while \\"The Owl House just feels shaky and broad\\". He did however praise the animation and art direction, stating that \\"the episode (and the show as a whole) really can bring some visceral power within the frame\\". Bubbleblabber's David Kaldor gave the episode a \\"5/10\\", stating that \\"aside from competently serving that purpose as a finale\\" he didn't have \\"many positive things to say about it\\".

In the 1968 New Year's Honours de Berg was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for \\"service to the collection of archival material\\".  Personal  De Berg converted to Judaism and in 1941 married Woolf de Berg, a Lithuanian-born businessman. For more than ten years she dedicated herself to raising their children. De Berg died at home in Sydney on 3 February 1984. She was survived by her two daughters and son. Her husband predeceased her in 1981.  Legacy  De Berg's collection of sound tape reels of interviews with writers, historians, artists, musicians and scientists is held by the National Library of Australia. In 1989 a directory of her work, The Hazel de Berg Recordings: From the Oral History Collection of the National Library of Australia, was published. In reviewing it, Barry York called it a \\"unique and invaluable oral history source\\" for \\"Australian researchers, librarians, broadcasters, teachers, students and writers.\\"  References  External links  * Sound recordings of interviews held by the National Library of Australia Category:1913 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Oral historians ","title":"Hazel de Berg"},{"id":"65126449","text":"Martin Slovak (December 25, 1916 ‚Äì March 22, 1950) was an American football player.

During the floods, authorities employed boats to rescue people stranded in the streets across the city. Fallen power lines, out of service cell phone towers, and widespread fuel shortages due to heavy reliance on alternative power sources created many problems for the estimated 15 million residents of the city.

After the video of Blake's shooting in which he was seriously injured went viral, protests and riots broke out in the city of Kenosha and elsewhere. As a result of the shooting of Blake and the protests which followed, on August 26, professional athletes refused to play in their scheduled sports events, beginning with the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Some athletes in the NBA, Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), Major League Baseball (MLB), and Major League Soccer (MLS) decided not to play their games on August 26. Also on that day, the Women's Tennis Association Cincinnati Masters organizers postponed the tournament for one day to August 27, 2020. The strikes extended into August 27 and 28 when players from the National Hockey League (NHL) walked out of their playoff games. In response to the athlete strikes, nine National Football League (NFL) teams cancelled their scheduled practices on August 27, 2020. The athlete strikes occurred as part of the broader racial unrest in the United States in 2020. Background On May 25, 2020, George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, was killed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, during an arrest for allegedly using a counterfeit bill. Floyd's death sparked national and international protests against police brutality, lack of police accountability, and racism. As a result of Floyd's death, NBA players began wearing T-shirts with the words I Can't Breathe while warming up before their NBA games. The precedent for the NBA allowing the players to protest wearing the I Can't Breathe T-shirt was set in 2014 after the police killing of Eric Garner. Professional athletic strikes In response to the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, professional athletes in the United States walked out of and refused to play in their scheduled sporting events. The broader protests were organized under the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, which advocates non-violent civil disobedience to protest against police brutality and racially motivated violence against Black people. The Black Lives Matter logo was displayed on the National Basketball Association (NBA) courts during the 2020 playoffs. When the NBA restarted the 2019‚Äì20 season in July 2020, NBA players kneeled during the national anthem, with each player wearing a \\"Black Lives Matter\\" shirt. National Basketball Association During the 2020 NBA playoffs, players on the Milwaukee Bucks walked out of their August 26 first-round playoff game against the Orlando Magic in protest of the shooting of Jacob Blake. The team decided not to come out of their locker room and the game. It was initially reported the Bucks would forfeit the contest, however, the Magic did not accept the Bucks' forfeiture. The NBA and the National Basketball Players Association announced that in light of the Bucks' decision to refuse to play, all NBA games for the day were postponed. The Toronto Raptors had also discussed a walkout of their second-round playoff series with the Boston Celtics in frustration with a lack of social or legislative change after the killing of George Floyd and as a result of Blake's shooting. In a meeting involving the players that took place later that night, the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers voted to cancel the rest of the season in an informal vote. The other NBA teams voted to continue playing. Sean Roberts, a Republican member of the Oklahoma House of Representatives, threatened to pull tax breaks for the Oklahoma City Thunder if they kneeled. All of the players and coaches from both the Thunder and the opposing Utah Jazz kneeled anyway. The NBA also postponed their scheduled playoff games for August 28. The playoffs resumed on August 29. National Football League In response to the shooting of Jacob Blake, the Detroit Lions cancelled their scheduled practice on August 25. On August 27, nine NFL teams cancelled their scheduled practices. Nineteen other NFL teams did continue their scheduled practices. Several teams that did not cancel practice issued statements about unity. The Jacksonville Jaguars decided to cancel their scheduled afternoon activities. Major League Baseball In Major League Baseball on August 26, a game between the Milwaukee Brewers and Cincinnati Reds was stopped by striking players. Later that day, the Seattle Mariners‚ÄìSan Diego Padres and the Los Angeles Dodgers‚ÄìSan Francisco Giants games were postponed. On August 27, seven MLB games were postponed as a result of player strikes. At the New York Mets' Citi Field, a Black Lives Matter shirt was placed on home plate. On a day that was celebrated as Jackie Robinson Day across MLB, the August 28 game between the Houston Astros and Oakland Athletics was postponed, with both teams walking off the field in protest. National Hockey League The National Hockey League (NHL) players postponed their scheduled games for August 27 and 28. These games were part of the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs. Major League Soccer On August 26, Major League Soccer players staged a walkout of several games to highlight racial injustice. In all, the league cancelled five of the six scheduled games for August 26. United Soccer League Memphis 901 FC declined to travel to North Carolina for a scheduled USL Championship game against North Carolina FC on August 29, and the players instead participated in protests in Memphis. Forward Madison FC, which is playing its 2020 home games in Milwaukee, postponed a USL League One game scheduled for August 30 against North Texas SC. National Independent Soccer Association On August 27, the New York Cosmos and Detroit City FC announced that their scheduled game for August 29 would be postponed as both teams took part in protests. The following day, New Amsterdam FC and California United Strikers FC both announced they would not travel for their scheduled August 30 matches against Chattanooga FC and Los Angeles Force respectively. Women's National Basketball Association All six games scheduled for August 26 and 27 were postponed. Women's Tennis Association On August 26, Naomi Osaka of the Women's Tennis Association announced she would not play in the Cincinnati Masters semifinals as part of the protest following the shooting of Jacob Blake. The Western & Southern Open organizers decided to reschedule matches scheduled for August 27 to the following day. In response, Osaka agreed to play her semifinal match, which she won 6‚Äì0, 7‚Äì6 (5). College athlete strikes Following the lead of professional athletes, several college football programs including Texas, Oklahoma, Texas Tech, Kentucky, South Florida, Boston College, Western Kentucky, Appalachian State, Mississippi State, Ole Miss and Baylor either cancelled practice or staged a walkout on August 27 and 28. Reactions to walkouts In a August 27 interview with CNN, Marc Short, Chief of Staff to Vice President Mike Pence, said, \\"If they want to protest, I don't think we care\\" when commenting on the NBA walkout in support of social justice reforms after the police shooting of Jacob Blake. On August 27, former Chicago Bears linebacker and Hall of Famer Brian Urlacher made a post to his Instagram story criticizing NBA players for staging walkouts of playoff games over the police shooting of Jacob Blake and stating \\"Patriot Lives Matter\\", causing much coverage and responses. In response to Urlacher's post, the Chicago Bears stated, \\"the social media posts in no way reflect the values or opinions of the Chicago Bears organization.\\" Union strikes Just before Labor Day 2020, union leaders from education, auto workers and other unions have said that they may be willing to authorize strikes to make lawmakers take action on police reform. Union leaders have said that they are copying the example set by professional athletes who walked out or refused to participate in contests because of the Jacob Blake shooting. Variations and disagreements over terminology There has been disagreement over whether to refer to the player action as a strike or a boycott. When a New York Times headline referred to it as a \\"boycott\\", Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York responded on Twitter that \\"strike\\" was the proper term. LeBron James used the term \\"boycott\\" in response to the National Basketball Players Association calling it a \\"postponement\\". Multiple terms are in use (emphasis added): *NPR had an article Week In Sports: Players Strike In Solidarity With Protests For Racial Justice. *Vanity Fair had After Sweeping Player Strikes, Professional-Sports Owners Are Asked to Confront the Next Steps. *NBC News had NBA to restart playoffs Saturday, ending player walkout after Jacob Blake shooting. *The Anchorage Daily News headlined an Associated Press article Second day of NBA playoff games halted after player walkout in protest of social injustice. *Sporting News had Adam Silver responds to player boycott: 'I wholeheartedly support NBA and WNBA players. *Mother Jones had NBA Players Are Staging a Wildcat Strike.

A veteran of the Moro Rebellion, Pancho Villa Expedition, World War I, and World War II, he attained the rank of major general. Magruder was most notable as the first commander of the 1st Armored Division and commander of the Infantry Replacement Center at Camp Wolters, Texas during World War II. Early life Magruder was born in Washington, D.C. on December 3, 1882, a son of George Washington Corbin Magruder (1855-1936) and Eleanor Ann Helen Marshall (1852-1906). He was educated in the public schools of Washington, and graduated from Central High School in 1903. Set on a military career from an early age, Magruder served as a first lieutenant and captain in the Washington YMCA's cadet corps, which he commanded during drill and ceremony competitions and similar events, including the March 1901 inauguration of President William McKinley. In addition, he gained his initial military experience during high school, when he enlisted in the District of Columbia National Guard and was commissioned as a first lieutenant in Company D, 6th Battalion. Magruder's additional education included Emerson Preparatory School and Maryland Agricultural College. He also attended Columbian University (now George Washington University) as a member of the class of 1907, and he joined the Theta Delta Chi fraternity. In 1904, he enlisted in the United States Army as a private. Assigned to the 87th Coast Artillery Company, he served at Fort Totten, New York until 1907 and attained the rank of sergeant. Start of career After attaining noncommissioned officer rank, Magruder competed for an Army commission. He passed the multi-day examination, and on February 11, 1907 he received appointment as a second lieutenant of Infantry. Assigned to the 18th Infantry Regiment, Magruder soon departed for occupation duty in the Philippines. He served there until 1910, and took part in the Moro Rebellion, in which the United States acted to end an insurgency by the Moro people. After returning to the United States, Magruder served at Fort Mackenzie, Wyoming. He was promoted to first lieutenant on July 19, 1911. From 1912 to 1913, he served as aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Frederick Appleton Smith. In 1913, Magruder returned to the Philippines, this time stationed at Fort William McKinley. He was promoted to captain on July 1, 1916. In October 1917, Magruder was appointed adjutant of the post at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia when the post began to expand in anticipation of U.S. entry into World War I. World War I Magruder as a lieutenant colonel in 1919 In November 1917, Magruder was promoted to temporary major and assigned as executive officer of the Intelligence Section (G-2) on the staff of the American Expeditionary Forces headquarters in France. He was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel in November 1918. Magruder served on the AEF staff until the end of the war, except for brief period of temporary duty on the staff of I Corps. He received the Army Distinguished Service Medal after the war in recognition of his superior performance of duty. In addition, Magruder was a recipient of the French Legion of Honor (Chevalier) and Belgian Order of the Crown. Post-World War I Magruder returned from France in 1919 and was assigned to the G-2 section of the Army staff at the War Department. On July 1, 1920, he was reduced from temporary lieutenant colonel to his permanent rank of major. In 1922, Magruder was selected for attendance at the Infantry Officer Advanced Course (now the Maneuver Captains Career Course), and he graduated in 1923. In 1925, he began attendance at the United States Army Command and General Staff College. He completed the course in 1926, and was ranked as a distinguished graduate. After graduating, he remained at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas to serve on the Staff College faculty. In 1927, he was reassigned to the staff of the Army's Chief of Infantry. He was later assigned as an instructor for the Organized Reserve Corps of the Third Corps Area, with offices in Washington, DC. On May 27, 1930, Magruder was promoted to Lieutenant colonel. Stylized portrait of Magruder from the dedication page of the North Carolina College of Agricultural and Mechanic Arts 1936 yearbook While stationed in Washington, Magruder also served as an instructor for officers of the Organized Reserve Corps's 330th Infantry Regiment. In addition, he commanded 1st Battalion, 62nd Coast Artillery Regiment. From 1931 to 1936, Magruder served as a professor of military science for the Reserve Officers' Training Corps program at North Carolina College of Agricultural and Mechanic Arts (A&M;). He later commanded the program, and he received promotion to colonel on August 1, 1935. In 1936 and 1937, Magruder commanded the 66th Armor Regiment at Camp Meade, Maryland. When the regiment received its first two light tanks, unit members decided to name one for Magruder, and his wife took part in the christening ceremony. From 1937 to 1940, Magruder served as executive officer of the Infantry Center and School at Fort Benning, Georgia. He was promoted to brigadier general on November 1, 1939. In 1940, he served as commander of the Washington Provisional Brigade, the precursor to the Military District of Washington. World War II As the Army began to organize and train in anticipation of entry into World War II, Magruder was assigned to command the 7th Provisional Tank Brigade, which experimented with tactics and equipment. Convinced by the results of the May 1940 Third United States Army maneuvers that the United States would need to field an armored force for the war, tank and Cavalry unit commanders including Magruder, George S. Patton, and Adna R. Chaffee Jr. agreed to recommend its creation to George Marshall, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army. Marshall concurred, and the Army organized and fielded the I Armored Corps. Chaffee was assigned as corps commander, with Magruder assigned in July 1940 as commander of the 1st Armored Division and Charles L. Scott assigned to command the 2nd Armored Division. Magruder as commander of 1st Armored Division in the summer of 1941 As the first commander of the 1st Armored Division, Magruder organized and equipped it at Fort Knox, Kentucky using personnel, vehicles, and weapons from the 7th Cavalry Brigade and 6th Infantry Regiment. In addition, Magruder received credit for devising the division's nickname, \\"Old Ironsides\\". He was promoted to Major General on October 1, 1940. When the Army formed additional Armored divisions in 1941, Magruder's 1st provided experienced and trained soldiers as the cadre around which the new 4th Armored Division was created. In March 1942, Magruder was succeeded as division commander by Orlando Ward. He was then assigned as commander of the Infantry Replacement Training Center (IRTC) at Camp Wolters, Texas. Responsible for providing trained and ready soldiers to units fighting in Europe and the Pacific, Magruder remained in charge of the IRTC until after the end of the war in 1945, and was succeeded by Brigadier General Maurice L. Miller. Magruder received the Legion of Merit to commend his service with the 1st Armored Division and IRTC. After leaving the IRTC, Magruder was unassigned pending retirement. His duties included inspection visits to the ROTC program at North Carolina A&T; and participation in events organized by the Reserve Officers Association. He retired on May 31, 1946. Retirement and death In retirement, Magruder was a resident of first Biloxi, Mississippi, then Winter Park, Florida. He died at the Orlando Air Force Base Hospital in Orlando on July 23, 1953. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Family In 1912, Magruder married Clara Ferol Lott (1891-1955). They divorced before 1930, and in 1935 he married Ethel (Marshall) Stevenson. With his first wife, Magruder was the father of sons Bruce Jr., (1922-2017) an officer in the United States Marine Corps, and William (1923-1977), who served as a United States Air Force officer. Magruder's siblings included Marshall Magruder, a career Army officer who attained the rank of brigadier general. Magruder was also a collateral descendant of George Washington. A great-great-great-grand nephew, he traced his family line through both Washington's brother John Augustine Washington and Washington's half-brother Augustine Washington Jr. ReferencesExternal links * Category:1882 births Category:1953 deaths Category:Military personnel from Washington, D.C.

Lili√°n Celiberti (born 1949) is a Uruguayan feminist activist. She became a political prisoner under the military dictatorship and lived in exile in Italy. She is a founding member and coordinator of the feminist collective Cotidiano Mujer, and she is also a leader in Articulaci√≥n Feminista Marcosur, which promotes the development of a feminist political platform at the regional and global level.  Early life  Lili√°n Celiberti was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1949. She was the oldest daughter in her family. At age 16, she began studying to be a schoolteacher, which helped form her social outlook and motivated her later political activity. She joined a socio-pedagogical action group with her classmates, traveling to visit rural schools. In 1967, she was elected to the board of her student center, and the following years of frequent student agitation had a lasting impact on Celiberti's political and social trajectory. Many of her peers would later be disappeared under the dictatorship, including Elena Quinteros and Gustavo Insaurralde.  First imprisonment and exile  By 1972, at 21 years old, Celiberti had joined the Uruguayan Anarchist Federation. While she was working as a teacher in a school in the Villa del Cerro neighborhood of Montevideo, she was detained by Uruguayan troops. For two years, she was held prisoner in various places including the Punta de Rieles Prison, a military prison for women that held over 600 political prisoners over the course of the 12-year dictatorship. Her family managed to help arrange her release, and she was exiled to Italy‚Äîthe terms of her release did not permit her to reside in any Latin American country. It was in Italy that Celiberti became involved in the feminist movement; there was a large women's movement in Milan at the time that had just won the right to divorce and was campaigning for the right to abortion. Though she had experienced machismo sexism and witnessed horrific gender-based violence in Uruguay, in Italy she acquired the framework and strategies to begin combating these problems.  Return to Latin America and kidnapping  In 1976, Celiberti joined the Uruguayan leftist Partido por la Victoria del Pueblo, which was founded in Buenos Aires the previous year. Frustrated with her inability to help her comrades in Uruguay who were being jailed or disappeared, she traveled to Brazil with her partner, Universindo Rodr√≠guez, and their two children, Camilo and Francesca, to meet with fellow exiles. On November 12, 1978, Celiberti was kidnapped by Uruguayan authorities along with Rodr√≠guez and their children, who were 8 and 3 years old at the time. High-level officials in the Uruguayan military had traveled in secret with the consent of the Brazilian military dictatorship to where the couple was staying, in Porto Alegre, the capital of Brazil's Rio Grande do Sul state. The kidnapping was widely denounced in the media thanks to a pair of Brazilian journalists who discovered the operation and exposed it in the magazine Veja. Because of the publicity, the abductees managed to avoid being killed‚Äîthe only ones to avoid such a fate out of the nearly 200 Uruguayan dissidents who were kidnapped abroad in this period.Cunha, Luiz Cl√°udio. \\"Morre o homem que salvou L√≠lian Celiberti\\". Zero Hora, 2006-12-10. Instead, their kidnapping became an international scandal, which was a problem for the Brazilian and Uruguayan military regimes. The abductees were brought to Uruguay, where Celiberti and Rodr√≠guez were separated from their children, who were sent to live with their grandparents. Celiberti and her partner were imprisoned for five years, during which time they were tortured and not allowed to see their children. She was held once again at Punta de Rieles. Her testimony regarding this period of imprisonment is recorded in the book Mi habitaci√≥n, mi celda (\\"My Room, My Cell\\"), which is based on interviews with the journalist Lucy Garrido.  Release and aftermath  With the return of democracy to Uruguay in 1984, Celiberti and her partner were released. In 1991, through an initiative of governor Pedro Simon, the state of Rio Grande do Sul officially acknowledged the kidnapping and offered them compensation for its impact. The government of Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle did the same a year later. Celiberti, along with other women such as Elena Fonseca and Ana Mar√≠a Colucci, created the feminist collective Cotidiano Mujer in 1985. She has continued to teach and organize feminist actions, and she has produced more than a dozen works on feminist subjects.  Personal life  Though Celiberti and Rodr√≠guez never married, they were lifelong partners and collaborators for over 40 years. He died in 2012, at age 61.

It is the most deadly avalanche or glacier-related disaster in history, and the third or fourth most deadly landslide-related disaster of the 20th century, after the Haiyuan landslides (China), the Armero tragedy (Colombia) and by some estimates the Khait landslide (Tajikistan). The north peak of Huascar√°n from which the avalanche originated had been considered unstable since 1962, when a smaller collapse wiped out several villages of the Callej√≥n de Huaylas valley near Yungay. However, the provincial government made efforts to prevent the news from spreading and urged people not to panic. The 1970 earthquake destabilized a glacier and snowmass which surged rapidly downhill, becoming a mudflow as it accumulated large volumes of loose dirt, rock and surface water. The death toll was made worse due to the earthquake having occurred on a Sunday, as thousands more people had congregated in Yungay for market when the mudflow struck and leveled the city. The slide then entered the R√≠o Santa and caused extensive damage as it flowed all the way downstream to the Pacific Ocean. Following the disaster, the Peruvian government conducted relief efforts and planned to move the provincial capital from Yungay to a safer location at Tingua. Survivors resisted the resettlement proposal and thousands stayed in a camp just north of the destroyed city known as \\"Yungay Norte\\", which would eventually become the present-day town of Yungay. The government has forbidden redevelopment or excavation of the original town site, where a memorial has been established to commemorate the dead. Although most of Yungay was completely leveled by the earthquake and mudflow, some remnants, including the ruined cathedral and cemetery, can still be seen in the area. Although Yungay was located outside of the direct avalanche path, the slide was so large that it overwhelmed the natural geographic barriers protecting the town, whose location had previously been considered safe. The United States Geological Survey stated that \\"conceivably, such an event may not occur again for thousands of years.\\" Background=Geography and geology Due to its rugged terrain, high elevation and location in an active seismic zone, the Callej√≥n de Huaylas, or upper R√≠o Santa valley has historically been vulnerable to large landslides, mudslides and avalanches. Huasc√°ran, the highest peak of the Peruvian Andes, rises to an elevation of to the east of the valley. R√≠o Llanguanuco, a tributary of R√≠o Santa, drains a ravine on the northwest flank of Huasc√°ran and cuts a steep southwesterly path to join the larger river, forming an alluvial fan in a wide valley near its mouth. Due to the fertile soils and availability of surface water, the area had been farmed for hundreds of years and was home to many small villages. The original site of Yungay town was an elevated area northeast of the R√≠o Santa and north-west of the R√≠o Llanguanuco; it was outside of the Llanguanuco valley, with a low ridge (Cerro de Aira) separating the two. View of Nevado Huascar√°n from Yungay Debris-flow deposits of Holocene origin make up the R√≠o Llanganuco alluvial fan and underlie the R√≠o Santa bed for depths of hundreds of metres in places, indicating that such flows have occurred here regularly for thousands of years. Geologic evidence indicates that Yungay itself was \\"probably built on a flow or avalanche deposit.\\" The name of nearby Ranrahirca village means \\"pile of thrown stones\\" in Quechua, suggesting that debris avalanches have been observed in the valley since ancient times. These destructive flows of snow, ice, mud and rock are locally termed huaycos. The northwest side of Huascar√°n has been called \\"one of the most unstable ice-covered areas in the Cordillera Blanca\\". Among the many glaciers and permanent icefields on Huascar√°n is \\"Glacier 511\\" located below the nearly vertical face of Huascar√°n's north peak. The glacier fills the head of the very steep Quebrada Armapampa ravine, which eventually flows into R√≠o Llanguanuco. Beneath the snout of Glacier 511 the terrain slopes down at an average pitch of 23 degrees (in some places exceeding 70 degrees), with a total vertical drop of before reaching the more gently sloped valleys below, creating ideal conditions for any large falling mass of rock to move unobstructed at high speed. Yungay before the disaster In the late 1960s, Yungay's permanent population was around 4,000 or 5,000,Haller, Andreas (2010): Yungay: recent tendencies and spatial perceptions in an Andean risk zone. In Espacio y Desarrollo 22, pp. 65‚Äì75 which swelled greatly on market and church days when thousands of visitors arrived from the surrounding villages. With the notable exception of the massive stone cathedral at the center of town, the city consisted predominantly of two or three-story adobe and wood structures with heavy tile roofs, dating from the Spanish colonial period. This fragile housing stock, typical of structures elsewhere in the R√≠o Santa valley, was highly vulnerable to seismic activity. Other prominent features of Yungay included the central Plaza de Armas surrounded by palm trees, which hosted events including the fiesta of Santo Domingo, and the elevated cemetery, which was actually built on top of a pre-Inca burial mound which may be as old as 10,000 years. In the years leading up to 1970, Yungay ‚Äì sometimes nicknamed \\"Pearl of the Huaylas Corridor\\" ‚Äì had become one of the most popular tourist destinations in Peru due to its picturesque location, architecture, and proximity to Huascar√°n and the Llanganuco lakes. Yungay had been struck by disaster before; it was reported to be \\"almost completely wiped out by an avalanche\\" in 1872, implying an avalanche at least equal to the magnitude of the 1970 event. 1962 Ranrahirca avalanche On January 10, 1962, part of Glacier 511 collapsed, causing 10 million cubic metres (13 million yd3) of rock, ice and snow to crash down into R√≠o Llanganuco. The slide destroyed nine villages and killed more than 4,000 people. The entire town of Ranrahirca, which was built on the Llanguanuco fan at the edge of the slide path, was flattened; some 2,900 people died in Ranrahirca alone. Residents had little to no warning, as less than four minutes passed from the beginning of the slide before the flow reached the R√≠o Santa. Everything in the wave's path was destroyed, and corpses were washed as far as the Pacific Ocean, downstream. This slide was not caused by an earthquake, nor were seven other large avalanches and debris flows that occurred in the Santa Valley between 1940‚Äì1970. Rather, the glacier had fractured under its own weight. Due to the steep slope of the underlying rock and lubrication by glacial melt, there was nothing to stop the ice from sliding downhill at high speed. In the wake of this and other glacier-related disasters in the Ancash region, notably glacial lake outburst floods that destroyed parts of Huaraz in the preceding two decades, the national government had tried to push forward \\"hazard zoning\\" which would limit development in flood and avalanche zones. However, these efforts were largely unsuccessful due to resistance by locals, who feared the economic and cultural disruption that would result from forced relocation. Post-1962 observations and controversy In September 1962, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology sponsored a glaciological expedition to assess the aftermath of the Ranrahirca slide. American climbers David Bernays and Charles Sawyer observed, in the aftermath of this slide, \\"a massive vertical slab of rock being undermined by Glacier 511\\" posing the threat of a much larger collapse. The overhanging cliff was as much as high in places and the rock was described as being \\"pervasively fractured.\\" Although the risk to Yungay was remote, the town could be threatened if a \\"sufficiently large avalanche\\" were to spill over the ridge to its east. The Americans' findings were reported on September 27, 1962 in the El Expreso newspaper, under the headline \\"Dantesque Avalanche Threatens Yungay.\\" Local authorities ordered this information to be retracted, and discouraged citizens from speaking about the threat, in order to prevent panic: \\"Anyone who spoke in favor of the Americans' conclusions would be charged under the Penal Code for disrupting public tranquility.\\" The director of the regional Lakes Commission, Miguel Eli√°s Pizarro, was asked to \\"provide an expert analysis.\\" Pizarro \\"dismissed the American mountaineers' statements as outlandish, hurried and uninformed\\" and stated that Yungay was in no danger, being well out of the path of the 1962 slide. Bernays and Sawyer were reportedly threatened with arrest, and they soon fled the country. Prior to that, Bernays had attended a public meeting in Huaraz where he called the Expreso coverage \\"exaggerated\\", though he did not deny the possibility that a large enough avalanche could affect Yungay. This same glacier would be the origin of the much larger collapse that destroyed Yungay eight years later. Earthquake and landslide Aerial view of the damage, showing the origin point on Huascar√°n and debris fans in the valley below At 3:23 PM on Sunday, May 31, 1970 the Ancash earthquake (also known as the Great Peruvian earthquake) struck off the coast of Peru with a moment magnitude of 7.9. The shaking dislodged a slab of rock about wide from the western face of Huascar√°n's north peak, at an elevation of roughly . The rockfall occurred almost immediately after the shaking began, with witnesses comparing the sound to a gunshot or explosion. The fall triggered an \\"enormous dark cloud of dust\\" which rapidly blocked the view from below. The rock fell some vertically before landing on Glacier 511 and sliding nearly down its surface, accumulating a large volume of firn snow as it went. The initial ice- rock avalanche volume was at least 25 million cubic metres (33 million yd3), and grew rapidly in size as it fell down the steep Llanganuco valley, picking up large volumes of dirt, loose glacial moraine, water and uprooted trees. With area soils saturated near the end of the rainy season, and the large amount of snow and ice scraped off the glacier surface, the avalanche quickly liquefied into a fluid, fast-moving mudflow. The maximum volume of the mudflow was as much as 100 million cubic metres (130 million yd3), and it reached speeds of up to per hour. Some debris projectiles launched ahead of the main flow may have exceeded per hour. According to a U.S. Geological Survey report published the same year, the mudflow may have achieved its unusually high speed due to \\"air-cushioned flow\\", a mixture of snow, ice and entrapped air that allowed the bulk of the material to essentially float over the ground. The initial acceleration of the mass down the low-friction glacial surface was also a major factor, catapulting the material downhill at a much higher speed than if it had slid over bare rock or earth. Destruction of Yungay In Yungay, people rushed outside after the earthquake hit; many flocked to churches to shelter and pray. Most buildings in the city were damaged or destroyed by the earthquake, though initial casualties were low compared to the mudflow that followed. The mudflow struck Yungay, from the avalanche origin, an estimated 1 minute, 42 seconds after the earthquake began. Although the nearly hill of Cerro de Aira stood between Yungay and the Llanganuco valley, the mudflow struck the ridge at a high enough speed ‚Äì some per hour ‚Äì that part of it leapt over the crest, first destroying the villages of Shillkop, Aira and Ongo before descending upon Yungay. A large air blast preceded the debris flow, followed by a rain of boulders and large debris before the main, semi-liquid wave struck. The wind blast was \\"strong enough to throw people to the ground and in some places to topple trees.\\" Giant rocks \\"bounced and rolled\\" towards Yungay, leaving huge craters in the ground and flattening buildings that had not been already destroyed by the earthquake. The mudflow itself was described by survivors as \\"rolling\\", \\"wavelike\\" or \\"a rolling confused motion.\\" Due to the speed of the flow, there was no time to evacuate. Practically every man-made structure in Yungay except a few on the outskirts were destroyed, and thousands of people were killed instantly. Survivor Mateo Casaverde described the scene: Effects elsewhere The majority of the mudflow headed straight down R√≠o Llanganuco, which formed the most direct path for the slide. The villages of Incayoc and Huashau, closest to the base of Huascar√°n, were struck first. A group of Czechslovak climbers on their way up the mountain were killed nearby. The entire Llanganuco delta area was destroyed, including the rebuilt town of Ranrahirca, where an estimated 1,800 people were killed. \\"An unknown, but probably large, number of additional casualties were sustained elsewhere in the extensive area covered by the debris lobe.\\" As had occurred in Yungay, huge boulders were thrown hundreds of metres across the valley, destroying everything in their path. The largest single boulder found in the slide, near the site of Ranrahirca, weighed . The slide dammed the R√≠o Santa, causing it to back up in a long lake. Material traveled as much as vertically up the opposite bank, destroying part of Matacoto village, before reversing and falling back into the river with a thunderous roar. Survivors described the motion as \\"like a wave on the shore.\\" Within thirty minutes the landslide dam overflowed, and debris and mud flowed downstream for some at speeds up to per hour, causing damage all along the river banks. In Caraz, downstream of Yungay, the airport and much of the surrounding farmland were flooded, and a highway bridge at Choquechaca was destroyed. The dam of the Ca√±on del Pato hydroelectric plant was also destroyed, although the power station itself was unharmed. At Huallanca below Ca√±on del Pato, the river reportedly dried up for an hour after the earthquake, due to its temporary blockage upstream, then abruptly rose from its bed. After the water receded \\"dozens of corpses, and vehicles and other manmade materials\\" were found deposited in the flood zone. Large sections of railroad and highway between Huallanca and Chimbote were either buried or washed away, cutting off access to the region. It reportedly took eight or nine days for the river to cut completely through the debris dam and restore its original course. Casualties and losses Upper level of the Yungay cemetery and Cristo Redentor statue; many people sought refuge here when the mudflow hit town The number of deaths from the 1970 avalanche has been difficult to quantify; due to the sheer size of the devastated area and the depth to which the towns were buried, thousands of missing bodies were never found. Furthermore, the casualties in Yungay were greatly increased due to the disaster having occurred on Sunday ‚Äì market day ‚Äì when many people had come in from the countryside. Most estimates range between a total of 15,000 and 18,000 killed in Yungay and the surrounding villages, although some sources cite a death toll as high as 22,000 or 25,000. Only about 400 people survived in Yungay proper, 300 of which were children, who had been attending a circus in the local stadium; reportedly a clown led them to higher ground just in time before the mudflow struck. Ninety-two people also survived by climbing an artificial hill at the town cemetery. These were the only structures in town that remained intact, along with \\"a statue of Jesus Christ with his arms outstretched, standing tall above the rubble\\" which remains today as a memorial to the dead. A photograph of four palm trees that once surrounded Yungay's main plaza, half buried in the mudflow but still standing, became symbolic of the disaster. The debris covered a total area of and reached depths of up to in the Ranrahirca area; in places the flow spread as wide as . Yungay town was buried under about of debris. Much of the mud that initially buried the city drained away within a few days of the disaster, leaving a plain of larger rocks which remains today in much the same state. Aftermath=Relief efforts Ruins of the Yungay cathedral Due to Yungay's cultural and economic importance as the capital of Yungay Province, many survivors not only from Yungay but the surrounding villages resisted government efforts to resettle them elsewhere. Within a year of the disaster, some 2,000 survivors had clustered in the refugee camp known as \\"Yungay Norte\\", only a few hundred metres north of the destroyed city. Although this location was much safer from landslides than old Yungay, it was geographically constrained ‚Äì \\"aid personnel speculated that if the capital of the province were relocated there, it would soon outgrow the safe area and spill over into dangerous zones.\\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.1977.4.1.02a00060/pdf The national government created the Comisi√≥n de Reconstrucci√≥n y Rehabilitaci√≥n de la Zona Afectada (CRYRZA) agency to oversee aid and reconstruction efforts in the areas affected by the Ancash earthquake. Soon after the disaster, authorities supervised repair of Yungay's irrigation systems which had been destroyed by the mudflow. However, the year's agricultural output still fell far short of normal. Relief efforts were hindered by the damage to roads and bridges in rough terrain; \\"it took two or three days for supplies to reach the upper Santa valley by road from Lima airport.\\" There was controversy over the distribution of aid, as urban dwellers felt they were not receiving enough compared to indigenous peasants. President Juan Velasco saw the disaster as \\"a unique opportunity\\" to carry out his populist agenda, which aimed to erase socioeconomic divides in rural provinces such as Yungay. \\"For the urban elite accustomed to advantages over the indigenous population, equality was an insidious proposition.\\" Yet for rural inhabitants, \\"it was a unique opportunity for social mobility in a frontier-like scenario.\\" Reconstruction Monument at Yungay Viejo and view of Huascar√°n In November 1970, authorities announced plans to relocate the provincial capital itself to a place called Tingua, away. This plan was poorly received, being far from the peasant farmers who depended on Yungay's markets to sell their produce, and came to town for religious functions. Such an arrangement would also leave the urban population without nearby sources of food, goods and revenue (from renting of farmland). \\"The Tingua site for the new capital would have disrupted traditional social, economic and political patterns of interrelationships within the capital as well as between the rural and urban sectors of society. The Yungaino leaders were determined to avoid this disruptive project at all costs.\\" Ultimately, the national government began the construction of a permanent town at Yungay Norte, with significant international assistance. By 1975, Yungay Norte was simply known as \\"Yungay\\", with the site of the destroyed town known as \\"Yungay Viejo\\". The new city already had electricity, running water, clinics, schools, a church, and permanent housing. By the early 1990s Yungay had recovered to its pre- avalanche population. The social composition of the town was completely changed, especially since a large number of old Yungay's survivors ended up moving to coastal cities, to be replaced by migrants from rural areas. The Peruvian government declared the site of Yungay a national cemetery, Campo Santo. Any excavation to recover the dead or search for artifacts is prohibited. A memorial in the shape of the original cathedral facade, a stone altar, and a large memorial garden and obelisk have been built on the site. Some survivors have erected headstones in the locations of their former homes. Visitors can still see a portion of the cathedral wall, the burial mound and statue of Christ, the four palm trees in the central plaza, and the wreckage of a bus. In the wake of the disaster, the national government greatly increased funding for the mitigation and prevention of glacier-related hazards. May 31 was also declared National Disaster Education and Reflection Day, in honor of the earthquake and avalanche victims.

Stebbins has published more than 300 research articles and is the author of more than 50 books and monographs. Most of his work in leisure studies has centered on amateurs, hobbyists, career volunteers, serious and casual leisure and the serious leisure perspective. Stebbins is the former President of Canadian Sociology and Anthropology Association and Social Science Federation of Canada. He is the recipient of Outstanding Contribution Award by Canadian Sociology and Anthropology Association and Marguerite Dentinger Prize by ACFA. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1999.  Education  Stebbins did his Bachelors from Macalester College in 1961 and then completed his Masters and doctoral studies in sociology from University of Minnesota in 1962 and 1964 respectively.  Career  Right after his Ph.D., Stebbins was appointed as Associate Professor of Sociology at Presbyterian College where he taught for a year before teaching at Memorial University of Newfoundland as an Assistant Professor from 1965 till 1968. For the next three years, Stebbins served as Associate Professor and Head of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology and then taught as a Professor from 1971 till 1973. He joined University of Texas at Arlington as a Professor of Sociology for a three year term. In 1976, Stebbins moved from USA to Canada and joined University of Calgary as Head of the Department of Sociology till 1982 and then taught as a Professor till 1999. In 2000, he was promoted to Faculty Professor and then to Professor Emeritus of Sociology. Stebbins served as President of the Canadian Sociology and Anthropology Association from 1987 till 1990 and Social Science Federation of Canada from 1990 till 1993. From 1997 till 2002, Stebbins was associated with World Leisure and Recreation Association (WLRA) as a Board Director. He became a Senior Fellow of the World Leisure Academy and Vice President of the Research Committee 13 (sociology of leisure) at International Sociological Association in 2010.  Research and work  Stebbins has conducted extensive qualitative research on humor, work, leisure, the work and leisure dimensions of deviance, and the leisure basis of francophone communities outside Quebec. Most of his work in leisure studies has centered on amateurs, hobbyists, career volunteers, serious and casual leisure and the serious leisure perspective (SLP), which is a term he coined in 1982 and elaborated in 2007. Since the beginning of his career, Stebbin's work has focused on developing a grounded theory of leisure of all types. A research sub-area that Stebbins most worked on is amateur musicians. He authored an article in 1969 about jazz musicians and role distance behavior. The purpose of this paper was to counter the confusion and vagueness associated with the concept of role distance. He proposed a comprehensive definition of role distance and explained the concept and kinds of role distance behaviors and elaborated these concepts by observing the role distance behaviors in jazz musicians. In 1978, Stebbins researched about the creation of high culture and the role of American amateur classical musician. He explainsed the interplay of high culture with the other three types of culture and studies jazz amateurs‚Äô interaction with jazz professionals to explain the professional- amateur-public system. He proposes a new method to analyze high cultures. Another crucial research area of Stebbins is serious leisure perspective. Since this was a term he coined himself, he published an article in 1982 explaining the term. He describes serious pleasure as the main paths people take to achieve their full potential. He explains the main types of serious leisure perspective and in another article, relates SLP with dabbling. He examines dabbling in detail and also explains its role in creating a career in music and other serious pastimes. Most of Stebbins research is consolidated and published as books. He has authored more than 50 books and monographs. In 1971, he published ‚ÄòCommitment to Deviance: The Nonprofessional Criminal in the Community‚Äô which was reviewed in Social Forces as a book that is ‚Äúuseful not only to those interested in the study of deviance, but those interested in the idea of commitment as a means of studying any kind of behavior.‚Äù In the review, the book is also recommended to ‚Äúprofessions which deal with the problems of publicly labeled deviants‚Äù. Stebbins published ‚ÄúAmateurs: On the Margin Between Work and Leisure‚Äù in 1979. This book sheds light to three amateur communities and shows the features of amateur perspective. Marianne Gosztonyi Ainley from University of Chicago Press Journals writes that the author ‚Äúoffers useful definitions for amateurs and professionals‚Äù and that ‚ÄúMuch of the subsequent text is sociologically minded.‚Äù In 1991, Lori V. Morris reviews Stebbins book ‚ÄúThe Laugh-Makers: Stand-Up Comedy as Art, Business, and Life-Style.‚Äù, and writes that the book ‚Äúattempts to cover a lot of ground‚Äù. She further states that ‚ÄúAnyone with a fan's curiosity about comedians would likely find this book interesting.‚Äù In 1996, Stebbins published a book called ‚ÄúThe Barbershop Singer: Inside the Social World of a Musical Hobby‚Äù. Stan Parker from University of Brighton calls the book ‚Äúshort but highly readable‚Äù and writes that the idea of the book is ‚Äúwell worth holding on to.‚Äù In The Serious Leisure Perspective (2020) Stebbins provides a synthesis of the 47 years of work on the SLP.

Romero developed the first technique to provide captions for sound films, making them accessible for the deaf and hard of hearing; his efforts inspired the invention of the captioning technique in use in films and movies today. Early life and education Emerson Irving Romero was born August 19, 1900 in Havana, Cuba. He was a first cousin to film and television star Cesar Romero. At age six, Romero was deafened by a fever caused by whooping cough. In 1907 his family sent him to New York City and he was enrolled in the Wright Oral School. After completing that school's program in 1915, he attended Stuyvesant High School for one year. He also attended Interlaken High School in Indiana and graduated from Blair Academy in New Jersey in 1920. He spent one year studying at Columbia University in New York City, then transferred to Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. After studying at Lafayette for two years, Romero was compelled to leave after his father had financial difficulties. Acting career After leaving Lafayette College, Romero found work at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. His older brother Dorian started a film company in Cuba, the Pan-American Film Corporation, and encouraged Romero to consider acting. Romero starred in a full-length film written by Dorian named A Yankee in Havana. In addition to acting, he also helped shoot film on location, edit films, and write subtitles. The films he starred in in Cuba were commercially unsuccessful but Romero's acting skills drew attention from director Richard Harlan, who encouraged Romero to move to Hollywood in 1926. From 1926 to 1928 Romero appeared in more than 24 two-reel short comedies, including Beachnuts, The Cat's Meow, Great Guns, Hen-Pecked in Morocco, Sappy Days, and a remake of Tillie's Punctured Romance. At the request of his film distributors, who wanted him to have a \\"more American- like\\" name, he changed his name to Tommy Albert. Romero did all his own makeup and stunt work and worked with actors such as W. C. Fields. When sound films (\\"talkies\\") were introduced in 1927, deaf people were no longer considered potential actors; studios no longer included intertitles and deaf people were shut out of enjoying movies. In the fall of 1928, Romero returned to New York and his previous employer, the Federal Reserve Bank. Later life Romero became active in the deaf community in New York City and along with friends John Funk and Sam Block started the Theatre Guild of the Deaf in 1934. The theatre company lasted for twenty years; Romero acted and directed in multiple plays throughout the years. In 1938 and 1939 he was the editor of Digest of the Deaf. He started a new career as a sheet-metal and template maker for Republic Aviation, helping to produce the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft used in World War II. Always looking for ways to help the deaf community, Romero bought several films and experimented with providing captions. In 1947, Romero developed the first captioning for a movie, slicing film strips and inserting images with captions between picture frames. The effect was similar to the title cards of silent movies, interspersing action scenes with images of text.. He rented the films to deaf schools and clubs. The films were of bad visual quality, in an attempt to prevent bootlegging; in addition, Romero's technique ruined the soundtrack of the film for anyone who was able to hear. However, his efforts were noticed by others, including Edmund Burke Boatner, the superintendent of the American School for the Deaf, who would create more practical methods of captioning and would co-found the U.S. government-funded Captioned Films for the Deaf program. Romero would go on to create and sell the Vibralarm in 1959, a vibrating alarm clock for deaf and hard of hearing people; he sold an entire product line of items for the deaf such as doorbells, smoke detectors and baby alarms. He retired from his job at Republic Aviation in 1965. In 1970 the New York City Civic Association of the Deaf honored Romero with its annual civic achievement award \\"in recognition of his tireless efforts and dedication to the deaf\\". Romero and his wife moved to Boulder, Colorado in spring 1972; he died there on October 16, 1972.

It contains the tomb of Sultan Moulay Isma'il, who ruled Morocco from 1672 until his death in 1727, and is located inside his former Kasbah (citadel). It is a major historic and religious site in the city.  History  279x279px  Context: Moulay Isma'il's reign  Moulay Isma'il became sultan upon the death of his brother Moulay Rashid in 1672. Breaking with tradition, he chose to make Meknes as his capital. Here, he built a monumental imperial palace-city (kasbah) on the southwest side of the old city (the medina). It consisted of several distinct palace complexes and other facilities spread across a vast area enclosed by fortified walls. The earliest of these palaces was the Dar al-Kebira, located in the northern part of the kasbah and finished in 1679. It was adjoined by the Lalla Aouda Mosque, which Moulay Isma'il also built (or rebuilt) around this time. The gate of the Dar al-Kebira palace, still located near the mausoleum today As sultan, Isma'il's 55-year reign was one of longest in Moroccan history. He distinguished himself as a ruler who wished to establish a unified Moroccan state as the absolute authority in the land, independent of any particular group within Morocco ‚Äì in contrast to previous dynasties which relied on certain tribes or regions as the base of their power. He succeeded in part by creating a new army composed of Black slaves (the 'Abid al-Bukhari) from Sub-Saharan Africa (or descendants of previously-imported slaves), many of them Muslims, whose loyalty was to him alone. Isma'il himself was half Black, his mother having been a Black slave. He also continuously led military campaigns against rebels, rivals, and European positions along the Moroccan coast. In practice, he still had to rely on various groups to control outlying areas, but he nonetheless succeeded in retaking many coastal cities occupied by England and Spain and managed to enforce order and heavy taxation throughout his territories. He put a definitive end to Ottoman attempts to gain influence in Morocco and established Morocco on more equal diplomatic footing with European powers in part by forcing them to ransom Christian captives at his court. These Christians were mostly captured by Moroccan pirate fleets which he heavily sponsored as a means of both revenue and warfare. While in captivity, prisoners were often forced into labour on his construction projects. All of these activities and policies gave him a reputation for ruthlessness and cruelty among European writers and a mixed reputation among Moroccan historians as well, though he is credited with unifying Morocco under strong (but brutal) leadership.  Development of the mausoleum  The mausoleum is located on the southwest side of the former Dar al-Kebira Palace, in a space that was formerly between the inner and outer perimeter walls of the palace. Moulay Isma'il chose this location in part because it was already considered sanctified by the presence of the tomb of Sidi 'Abd ar-Rahman al-Majdub, a 16th-century poet and Sufi mystic. The complex was first built in 1703 under Moulay Isma'il, but was modified and expanded multiple times, in particular under his son and brief successor, Ahmad ad-Dhahabi (who ruled, with interruptions, between 1727 and 1729), who was in turn buried here afterwards. Sultan Moulay Abd ar-Rahman, who died in 1859, was also buried here later. The funerary complex was originally entered from the north, directly from the Dar al-Kebira palace. The current entrance to the south dates from the French protectorate period in the 20th century. The original complex was less extensive than it is today and its plan likely included only the tomb chamber, the adjoining rooms on either side of it, and the main courtyard leading up to it. The other courtyards and passages were thus likely added later. The mausoleum is still visited today by Moroccans seeking baraka from Moulay Isma'il's tomb, in addition to being a significant tourist attraction in the city.  Architecture and layout  Main courtyard next to the mausoleum (looking east; cupola of the tomb chamber visible in the upper right) The funerary complex consists of various courtyards and chambers. The main central courtyard, located on the west side of the tomb chamber, is sparsely decorated except for a central fountain and zellij pavement. The western and eastern sides of the courtyard are occupied by porticoes of three horseshoe arches. The eastern wall of the courtyard, in front of the mausoleum, also features a small mihrab (niche indicating the direction of prayer). Behind this are the mausoleum chamber and adjoining rooms. The northernmost of these rooms, which can be accessed directly from the northeastern corner of the courtyard, consists of an indoor patio or courtyard covered by a high cupola ceiling. The layout of this patio is similar to the Chamber of the Twelve Columns in the Saadian Tombs, consisting of a square delineated by twelve marble columns arranged in groups of three at each corner, around which runs a gallery space. Another mihrab is set into the eastern wall, while a small side-chamber is set into the western wall. The upper walls and the areas around the mihrab and doorways are decorated with carved and painted stucco featuring arabesque and epigraphic motifs typical of Moroccan architecture. At the center of the patio is an ornate fountain, and while the cupola ceiling above primarily features painted and carved wood. The marble columns feature Moroccan-Andalusian capitals carved with leaf, palm, and palmette motifs. These marble columns, as well as the ornately-carved marble panels in the archway leading to the mausoleum antechamber, are believed to be spolia taken by Moulay Isma'il from the former Saadian palaces of in the Kasbah of Marrakesh (such as the Badi Palace). On the south side of the patio chamber is a large archway with ornate wooden doors which leads to a rectangular antechamber which precedes the actual mausoleum chamber. The mausoleum is a square chamber which holds the tombstones (mqabriyas) of Moulay Isma'il (died 1727), his son and successor Ahmad ad-Dhahabi (died 1729), and the later sultan Moulay Abd ar-Rahman ibn Hisham (died 1859). On the south side of the mausoleum is another large reading room divided by a triple-arched arcade and containing book cabinets. Each of these chambers is covered with carved stucco decoration and also holds several bronze chandeliers. The royal tombstones are made of marble and are richly carved with Arabic calligraphic inscriptions and arabesque motifs in a style similar to the marble tombstones of the Saadian Tombs.

It started operation in 1999. The act regulates the employment of federal public servants in Australia. It establishes obligations of the Commonwealth toward its public servants, and establishes the code of conduct to which they must adhere; including a requirement that they act apolitically, and not disseminate or exploit government information without authorization. It also establishes requirements that public servants be hired on merit. Prior to the public service act, other statutes were in force to ensure that public service selection would be on merit. Such statutes arose historically as an effort to eliminate the spoils system from democratic politics. The constitutionality of the code of conduct sections within the act were challenged in 2019 in the High Court. The High Court unanimously ruled the sections as compatible with Australia's freedom of political communication doctrine.

She was a \\"pioneer in the daily vacation bible school movement,\\" She was active in church work for over 60 years and was known as \\"the chief\\". Biography She was born in 1880 in Elwood, Illinois, a small suburb of Chicago. She was the daughter of John Richard Dickson and Grace Ellwood Dickson, her father was a merchant. Her parents both died while she was a child, and she was taken in by her grandparents at age fifteen. She was educated in the Chicago Public Schools. She became active in church work. She was appointed secretary of Second Presbyterian Church in 1904, and organized and was first president of the Young Women's Presbyterian Union. In 1906 she became secretary, treasurer and editor of the Federated Religious Press. In 1911 and 1912, as executive secretary of the Layman's Evangelistic Council she directed evangelistic campaigns across the country including for Billy Sunday, John Wilbur Chapman, and others. In the early 1920s, Dickson took under her wing a \\"motherless boy\\" named Richard E. Evans, and effectively (but not legally) became his foster mother. She guided his religious education and encouraged him to become a minister. In 1924 she moved to Edgewater Presbyterian Church and in 1925 was appointed one of the first deaconesses in Chicago, at that time the highest position a woman could hold in the church. In the fall of 1927, while still a seminary student, Evans preached at the newly established Presbyterian church in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin and made a strong impression. After just a few Sundays preaching, the congregation asked Evans to be their pastor. Dickson moved to Wauwatosa as well and became director of religious education at the church. Presbyterians had considered, but rejected, women as elders in 1920 and again in 1929. At the 1930 General Assembly in Cincinnati, the idea was approved by a vote of 158-118 on May 31, 1930. Pastor Richard Evans was present as an observer, and telephoned home to set up a congregational meeting upon his return. At that meeting on June 2, 1930, Dickson was unanimously elected an elder of the Wauwatosa church. One member remarked that this happened because \\"she deserved it.\\" Evans left Wauwatosa in 1933, and Dickson moved with him to another church. The pair moved to Florida in 1937 to work with a publishing company. Dickson was active in her career in promoting interfaith activities. During the 1950s she travelled to the Holy Land four times, each time in a wheelchair. Dickson moved to New York City in 1960 and was an elder at the Church of the Crossroads on 14th Street. She died at St. Barnabas Hospital on November 21, 1965. A Presbyterian retirement home in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin is named Dickson Hollow in honor of Sarah Dickson.

She was built in 1937 in the Dutch shipyard N.V. Verschure & Co, and launched to the lake on 12 October 1938. In 1939, she began operations under National Parks Administration. Since 1969, she is owned by the tourism operator Turisur. She is named after a former vessel,Modesta de O'Connor which, under command of Lieutenant Eduardo O'Connor, became in 1883 the first vessel to enter the Nahuel Huapi Lake from the Atlantic Ocean, through the Limay River. Personalities such as Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Che Guevara, Dwight Eisenhower, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (Shah of Iran) and his wife Farah Diba have traveled aboard Modesta Victoria.  History  The ship was envisaged by the General Direction of Navigation and Ports. In November 1935, the National Parks Administration (directed by Exequiel Bustillo) started a public bid to purchase a ship for the Nahuel Huapi Lake, to be launched simultaneously with the Llao Llao Hotel. Five companies presented offers, four from Argentina and Verchure from the Netherlands. The latter won the bid. Construction started under supervision of Manuel Bianchi, an engineer who had been involved in the construction of the ARA Presidente Sarmiento. As a construction inspector, he filed over 700 acts of disagreement to different aspects of the ship construction. The ship was constructed and assembled in Amsterdam, and then disassembled to be shipped by sea to Buenos Aires and from there, by rail until the lake in Bariloche. There, she was re-assembled (also under supervision of Manuel Bianchi) and, using a dry dock nearby to the rail station, launched to the Nahuel Huapi Lake on 10 November 1938. 275x275px In January 1939, she began operations for the Villalonga Express Transport Company. The first journey was on 12 January 1939. By then, she was assigned to several routes in the lake: Puerto Blest, Victoria Island (by then, called Anchorena Island), La Angostura, and the Correntoso Hotel. The vessel was transferred to the General Naval Prefecture for a time, and then transferred back to the National Parks Administration. In 1944, she transported the remains of Perito Francisco Moreno to the Centinela Island, where he rests to this day. In 1968, the National Parks Administration ruled that the Modesta Victoria operation was losing money and launched a public bid to sell her. On 12 December 1968, the offers of the public tender were revealed and she was sold to Turisur, a tourism operator who made the only offer in the bid. The ship was sold on the terms that she is kept in good condition and continues to navigate the Nahuel Huapi. She was refurbished and expanded by the new owner: a glass enclosure was made and the engines were replaced. Modesta Victoria sailing the Nahuel Huapi Lake  Technical aspects  When Modesta Victoria was first built, the ship had a maximum capacity of 165 passengers. Nowadays, the vessel can carry up to 300 people. She has three passenger decks, with teak floors, bronze fittings and alabaster lampshades. Its original engines were also replaced to fit two Volvo Penta 300 hp engines, which power the ship nowadays.

Season Prior to the season, in order to settle the confusion caused by using professional referees in amateur games, a meeting was held at the Harvard Club so that colleges could agree on a uniform code of rules to be observed by all. The meeting specifically did not address the new offside rule that the NHL was implementing, though that probably for the best as the NHL would have to alter its rule during the 1929‚Äì30 season to counteract the ballooning goal totals. In addition, Harvard began recording assists as an official statistic for this season. For the first time in 6 years Harvard did not open its season against MIT, instead they returned to their former home to play Boston University. Despite the change in opponent, Harvard still won its inaugural game though both teams weren't particularly sharp in the contest. In their annual contests against Canadian colleges, Harvard fell to Toronto twice but then rebounded after shuffling their lineup against usual opponent MIT. On January 8 Harvard played only the second game in the program's history against a western opponent when they faced Michigan Tech. The game was a debacle for the visitors as Harvard won 11‚Äì0 and looked well on their way to giving Yale a run for the intercollegiate championship. After another win over Boston University, Harvard welcomed Marquette to the Boston Garden on February 5th but the three-week layoff since their previous game appeared to have the Crimson chomping at the bit. Harvard took 10 penalties during the game, giving Marquette two separate 5-on-3 advantages. The Crimson defense responded well, holding back the Hilltoppers through most of the game, but Marquette slowly built a 2‚Äì1 lead and carried into the third period. With only 5 minutes remaining both teams began a furious effort to score and four goals were made at the end of the game, however, Harvard couldn't catch Marquette and lost 3‚Äì4. Harvard had their two series against Dartmouth and Yale remaining and redoubled their defensive efforts for the contests. In the two games against the Indians Harvard surrendered just one goal and then had a two week wait for the showdown with their arch rival. The Elis entered the series undefeated for the second year in a row and Harvard would have the honor of trying to spoil their season once more. In the first game the two traded one-goals leads but by the end of 60 minutes the score was tied 2‚Äì2 and another overtime thriller was in the making. Harvard double- teamed Hale Palmer, the Elis' high-scoring winger, every time he touched the puck which enabled captain Putnam to score the winner early in the 10-minute extra-session. The following week Harvard again prevented Palmer from scoring, but his work in the offensive end caused two of Yale's goals and the Bulldogs won the rematch 3‚Äì1. The playoff between the two would decide the Intercollegiate title and both teams prepared for a battle. Harvard, who had been outshone by Yale through most of the season, took two leads during the game but was unable to hold onto either for too long and, once more, overtime was required. Rather than attack, Yale held back, playing a defensive style much like Harvard and the two teams rarely threatened each other's netminders. The result was three rather dull overtime periods and the game ended in a draw. Plans for a fourth and (hopefully) deciding game began immediately after the contest was over. A few days later, after a conference between the athletic directors of each school, W. J. Bingham of Harvard ultimately decided to end the Crimson's ice hockey season and leave the two team without a clear victor. 1930 was the first time since 1900 that Harvard and Yale's ice hockey teams finished with a draw over the course of a season. The result was that both teams had claims to the eastern intercollegiate championship and would have to share the crown.

He is notable for publishing the first attempt at a typology of Cypriot pottery in a paper delivered at the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1871 and was later published the journal Archaeologia (vol. 45).

Some of the artefacts were exhibited at the Fine Arts section of the Yorkshire Exhibition of Arts and Manufactures in Leeds in 1875 and later sold to the Leeds Literary and Philosophical Society, the Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art (now the National Museum of Scotland), as well as a number of other museums.

Sam left to serve in the U.S. Army in Europe in 1943, and Lydon was born in November while he was away. She was named by her mother for actress Susan Hayward. After her father returned in 1945, the family welcomed two more daughters, Lorraine (1946) and Sheila (1949). In 1952, they all moved to Island Park on Long Island, to live in the newly built suburbs, and they changed their surname to Gordon. Son Ricky was born in 1956; post-partum woes added to the bouts of depression that had come over Eve in 1955. In 1961 at age 17, Lydon was sneaking out of the house to nightclubs, and smoking marijuana. Despite her misdeeds, she earned a full scholarship and entered Vassar College in September 1961 to study history. At Vassar, she started taking diet pills containing amphetamine, and continued to smoke marijuana. She met Michael Lydon, a student at Yale University. In 1965 she graduated from college and married Michael. Journalism Michael and Susan Lydon moved to the UK to work in journalism. He wrote about British affairs for the American magazine Newsweek. As a freelancer, she submitted fashion pieces for London Life magazine, the newly adopted name of the Tatler, published weekly during the Swinging Sixties. She also wrote for The Times. The two left London for San Francisco at the beginning of 1967, just in time to witness and report on Michael Bowen's Human Be-In in Golden Gate Park, where they dropped acid (lysergic acid diethylamide or LSD) and listened to Timothy Leary tell the crowd that people living in cities should reorganize as tribes and villages.Katz 1992. pp. 231‚Äì232 Lydon enrolled in graduate studies at San Francisco State University, but she soon dropped out of school. She wrote for Sunday Ramparts, a supplement of Ramparts, connecting with Jann Wenner, the arts editor. Wenner was starting Rolling Stone, and he recruited both of the Lydons to assist with managing the project. Michael Lydon thought he was hired as managing editor, but this position was taken by Herbert \\"Hirk\\" Williamson. Susan Lydon refused menial, secretarial assignments suggested by Wenner and instead wrote reviews and articles. She helped edit and produce the magazine. She gave the magazine its slogan \\"All the news that fits\\" which she lifted from an April Fools issue of the Columbia Daily Spectator, writing \\"All the news that fits we print\\", a parody of The New York Times slogan, \\"All the News That's Fit to Print\\". Lydon's daughter Shuna was born in March 1968, and she left Rolling Stone, writing for a short-lived Hearst periodical titled Eye aimed at the youth market. Helen Gurley Brown took over Eye as editor, and chastised Lydon for writing so much about sex, drugs and politics. Lydon accepted assignments from The New York Times Magazine, and she edited a biography of Huey P. Newton for Ramparts, later recalling the day when gun- toting Bobby Seale guarded the Ramparts office building while Eldridge Cleaver was smuggled out of the country. In late November 1968, Lydon attended the first women's liberation conference at Camp Hastings in Lake Villa, Illinois, at which 200 women's rights activists met. Lydon separated from her husband in January 1969, taking her daughter to Berkeley to live with Ramparts contributor Tuck Weills for six months. In December 1969 she was at the Altamont Free Concert to report on the Rolling Stones and the music scene, but she was appalled to witness there the death of the \\"good vibes\\" of the sixties. \\"The Politics of Orgasm\\" In Berkeley, Lydon met with women feminists who were conducting a consciousness raising awareness meeting, and she was shocked to hear one woman admit to never having experienced an orgasm. The women in the group opened up about their sexuality, and Lydon determined to write about this little-understood topic. She proposed the idea to Ramparts male editorial board, including Robert Scheer, who all laughed at her. She cried in the face of their ridicule, but persisted with her vision, writing the essay \\"Understanding Orgasm\\", which editor Peter Collier changed to \\"The Politics of Orgasm\\", published by Ramparts in 1970. Scheer buried the article in the back pages, but this failed to hide it. Scheer later said it turned out to be \\"one of our great articles\\". \\"The Politics of Orgasm\\" brought the subject of fake orgasm into the mainstream. A few earlier writers had uncovered the topic: based on the Kinsey Reports and the studies of Masters and Johnson, psychiatrist Mary Jane Sherfey had challenged Sigmund Freud's ideas in 1967, saying he was wrong about a distinct \\"vaginal orgasm\\", separate from clitoral orgasm, with the vaginal sort somehow superior. In 1968, Shulamith Firestone wrote the revealing \\"Women Rap About Sex\\" for the group New York Radical Women. Anne Koedt published \\"The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm\\" in the same issue of Notes from the First Year, which was seen by a limited circle of feminists. But Lydon's article prompted a much wider discussion of the prevalence of the fake orgasm, how a majority of women were unsatisfied in sex, frustrated by Freud's disproved assertion about vaginal orgasm. Lydon called upon women to stop creating and perpetuating problems by faking so many orgasms: \\"With their men, they often fake orgasm to appear 'good in bed' and thus place an intolerable physical burden on themselves and a psychological burden on the men unlucky enough to see through the ruse.\\" Newspapers and radio talk shows debated her work. Women began to demand equal rights in bed, insisting that their pleasure was its own goal. UK feminist Alison Garthwaite said that Lydon's paper electrified the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group, opening the topic of women's sexuality. Lydon divorced in 1971. She freelanced in rock journalism and took a series of lovers. She lived in Marin County for three years with drummer Dave Getz, ex-Big Brother and the Holding Company, and through him became addicted to heroin. She interviewed Helen Reddy for Ms. magazine, Dr. John for the Daily News, Mark Spitz for The New York Times Magazine, as well as Debbie Harry, Joni Mitchell and Paul Simon. While in Marin, Getz contracted hepatitis, likely from sharing drug paraphernalia, and Lydon soon acquired it, too, serious enough to confine her to bed. She was invited in 1974 by a friend at the Arica School to move with her daughter to New York to write for Arica. Recovering from illness, she founded and edited the Arica internal newspaper the No Times Times. She was a columnist at the The Village Voice, and wrote for The New York Times Magazine and other periodicals, often working from her communal residence in the Upper East Side of New York City, amid her Arica colleagues. In 1985, her addictions escalated beyond control, and she was evicted. Her daughter, Shuna, was left alone while Lydon worked multiple jobs, shoplifted, stole money or prostituted herself to get another dose of heroin.Lydon 1993 Lydon even stole her mother's car. Shuna found refuge at the Gordons' house in Long Island, staying with her grandparents during her high school years. In 1986, the Gordons organized an intervention, convincing Lydon to check in to a detox center in Minnesota. In Minnesota, she connected with a violent boyfriend, smoked crack cocaine and started \\"boosting\\" ‚Äì shoplifting for quick resale. She was arrested and prosecuted for theft and drug sales, and found guilty. Facing decades of jail time or court-ordered drug treatment, Lydon chose treatment and was sent from Minnesota to Mattapan in Boston. She started a long period of addiction recovery at Women Inc., a feminist clinic focused on the rehabilitation of hardcore female drug addicts, where she ceased all drug intake. After psychological evaluation at Women Inc., she faced the possibility that she had been sexually abused as a child by a family member. She proved her independence by staying clean for a year at the clinic, then moved to a nearby apartment to restore her career. Remaining sober for the rest of her life, she obtained work as a typesetter in Boston, and resumed freelance writing. In 1989, Lydon moved back to the San Francisco Bay Area, following her daughter, Shuna, who was enrolling in photography at California College of the Arts. Lydon settled in East Oakland, and in 1996 began writing for the Oakland Tribune and the associated ANG newspapers. She rose to the position of regional director and editor. In 2001, she started the popular column \\"Cityscape\\", highlighting local happenings. Knitting In her childhood, Lydon did some knitting, but she became more serious in college. In 1992 while birdwatching in Napa, she broke an arm and shoulder in a fall, and she used knitting as physical therapy. She became an avid knitter, and wrote about the subject, humorously questioning whether she was a \\"Master knitter or demon knitter. You be the judge.\\" Her best work was a series of shawls woven in a feather-and-fan pattern from qiviut, the fine inner hair of the muskox. She traveled the world to interview knitting women of various cultures that had retained the history and custom of knitting. From this material, she published two books: The Knitting Sutra (1997) and Knitting Heaven and Earth: Healing the Heart With Craft, the latter published in June 2005 just prior to her death in July. She likened knitting to prayer beads (\\"one prayer for each bead or each stitch\\") and devotional meditation: \\"I crave more deeply a communion with nature, with palpable works that emanate from the hands of God. I am a woman... I know how to pray with my hands, and I need those prayers to connect me with the earth.\\" Lydon led knitting workshops at various places including Esalen. Memoir Beginning in 1990, Don Katz began interviewing Lydon and her birth family the Gordons for his book Home Fires, published in 1992. The book was hailed as an unvarnished look at the struggles of a typical post-war American family in which the children rebelled and developed into adults in ways that were not foreseen by the parents. At the same time, Lydon started writing a memoir about her own life, published in 1993 as Take The Long Way Home: Memoirs Of A Survivor. Lydon's memoir focused on the more troubling aspects of her life, especially drug abuse, addiction, and incest. The Los Angeles Times reviewed the book as \\"extremely brave and moving\\". Lydon named her alcoholic grandfather as the likely malefactor of sexual abuse committed when she was two years old. Lydon was conflicted, certain that something bad had happened to her, but pleading \\"How will I ever know for sure?\\" Laura Shapiro of The New York Times was unimpressed with Lydon's revelation of childhood incest, accusing Lydon of a \\"fatal fondness for easy answers.\\" Shapiro opined that Lydon had failed to achieve the perspective of objectivity, despite her years of self-analysis at Arica. Lydon retreated every summer to a cabin on the Russian River to write, knit and birdwatch with women friends. She regularly spoke to recovering drug addicts about her experience. In 1994, Lydon had a kidney removed to treat renal cancer. In 2002, she took medical leave from her newspaper to fight breast cancer with chemotherapy and radiation. Treatment continued until April 2004, when liver cancer was discovered. In what would be the last weeks of her life, she went to Boca Raton in Florida to enter hospice and be with her sister, brother, mother, and daughter. She died of liver cancer on July 15, 2005, at the age of 61.

It is known for its fundraisers and drag shows, most notable of which is the annual Miss Paradise pageant. The club is integrated with the Empress Hotel; both are owned by record producer Shep Pettibone. Paradise's 1999 opening is credited as one factor that improved Asbury Park's struggling economy and drew the LGBT community back to the city after a period of local unrest. The venue is a popular Jersey Shore destination in the summer, and it has received praise for its welcoming atmosphere. After several months of closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Paradise reopened its outdoor pool and bar area in summer 2020. Description The swimming pool at Paradise Paradise is located adjacent to the boardwalk in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The street outside the venue is adorned with a rainbow crosswalk. Managed by Joseph \\"JoJo\\" Crisci, the club is attached to the Empress Hotel and features an outdoor swimming pool. Inside, it is split into two principal spaces: the main room and the Copper Bar. Lisa Rose of NJ.com wrote that \\"[a]lthough the club is geared toward the gay community, the crowd is eclectic, not limited by sexual orientation or age\\". Most of its clientele are in their early 20s to late 50s. Paradise is known for its dance music, comedy events and fundraisers. It runs a number of weekly drag shows, including \\"Bitchy Bingo\\" and tea dances. Miss Paradise pageant The club is also home to Miss Paradise, an annual drag pageant whose winner is awarded a yearlong in-house show. The competition was founded in 2000, and the first performer to take the crown was Lady Marisa. Miss Paradise 2018, Honey Davenport, went on to appear on the 11th season of RuPaul's Drag Race. Sapphira Cristal, who competed in the 2019 pageant, won the national title of Miss'd America later that year. Miss Paradise 2019, Mancie Mandell, was succeeded by Olivia Lux in February 2020. That year's edition of the pageant featured two celebrity judges: Margaret Josephs (of The Real Housewives of New Jersey) and her mother, Marge Sr. History=Background and early years Drag show in Paradise's Copper Bar Asbury Park was a popular destination for LGBT travelers at least as early as the 1930s, when it had a number of underground gay and lesbian bars. Conditions in the city deteriorated after a series of race riots in 1970 and the subsequent onset of the AIDS epidemic, which ravaged the local gay community. Circumstances began to improve in 1991, when New Jersey passed a law barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The state's first Pride celebration was held in Asbury Park the following year, and the town soon saw a boom in LGBT-owned businesses. In 1998, record producer Shep Pettibone purchased the Empress Hotel and its adjoining nightclub, at which time the facilities had been non-operational for more than a decade. Initially, the move was only meant to be a financial investment, but Pettibone decided to target his business toward the LGBT customer base in hopes that this would attract that community back to Asbury Park. He renovated both properties but focused on the club first; renamed Paradise, it opened in May 1999. The hotel followed in 2004 or 2005. According to NJ.com, Paradise is one of the oldest continuously operated gay clubs in New Jersey and has played a role in \\"the revitalization of Asbury Park\\". The town and its businesses, including well- known locales like The Stone Pony, were still struggling when Paradise opened, and the return of the club and hotel helped boost the local economy. It also contributed to the renewal of Asbury Park's popularity as an LGBT destination on the Jersey Shore. 2010s to present Hurricane Sandy blew the roof off of the Empress in 2012, and during the building's repair process, Pettibone gave Paradise a number of upgrades, including a new dance floor, video displays and laser lights. In the wake of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Paradise and other Asbury Park nightlife venues implemented new security measures, and local law enforcement increased its presence around all queer establishments in the area. Like other bars, clubs and restaurants, Paradise was ordered to close at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Jersey. Traditionally a prime location for Pride festivities, it instead held a virtual celebration in June 2020. Paradise was able to reopen its tiki bar and pool area for outdoor service in the summer. Reception In its 2018 article \\"All 47 bars in Asbury Park, ranked worst to best\\", NJ.com listed Paradise in 21st place and called it \\"the most popular gay club at the Jersey Shore\\". The venue has received praise for \\"the 'family-like' feeling one gets inside\\" and for \\"the transformative work it has done for the LGBT community over the past two decades\\". Michael Cook of Hornet.com said, \\"Poolside cocktails, tea dances and top DJs make Paradise the go-to spot for spending those lazy (and not-so-lazy) days of summer.\\" In an Instinct article, Cook wrote that the club was \\"a trailblazer in the community\\".

'Harumi' may mean sunny, spring or beauty, while 'fut≈ç' (Êµ∑) refers to coastline or pier. The harbour pier supports Harumi Terminal Park which berths cruise ships, and is part of an urban redevelopment project site associated with the 2020 Olympic Village. Neighbourhood The locale was created as land reclamation from seabed fill. The site was the intended place for an international exposition planned to coincide with the later-cancelled 1940 Summer Olympics. Helsinki, Finland, eventually hosted the 1952 Summer Olympics and Tokyo, the 1964 Summer Olympics. The six-story Harumi Passenger Terminal was opened in 1991 for the fiftieth anniversary of the opening of the Port of Tokyo. The terminal building has an observation deck. Harumifuto Park has a statue, with views to the large artificial island of Odaiba, and the Rainbow Bridge. The area is serviced by the Kachidoki Station (Âãù„Å©„ÅçÈßÖ Kachidoki eki) subway station (E17) on the Toei Oedo Line, and the Shij≈ç-mae Station (Â∏ÇÂ†¥ÂâçÈßÖ, Shij≈çmae-eki) subway station (U14) on the Yurikamome Line. Olympic Games 2020 Village Determined as the site for an Olympic Village to accommodate competitors, team staff, and sports officials, it should host up to 10,000 Olympic and 4,000 Paralympic athletes. The Harumi 5-chrome neighbourhood complex will be closed to the public during the two events. At least one Paralympic sport will accommodate the sports officials and national teams separate to the Village due to commuting delay concerns to the sporting venue. The Village forms the centre of an 'infinity' symbol between the 'Heritage' and 'Tokyo Bay' themed competition zones. Twenty-one residential buildings will be built, totalling 5,650 units. Buildings will range from 14 to 18 stories, total costing estimated to be ¬•207 billion (about 2 billion USD). It is intended to have three types of apartments: * apartments to house four athletes; * apartments to house seven people; * apartments to house eight people, with three bathrooms. Beds are reported to be constructed out of cardboard, holding a weight up to . Supplying 18,000 bed for the Olympic Games and 8,000 beds for the Paralympic Games, the beds and mattresses will be recycled into other products after the events. Some of the units will be sold post-events to establish a new community as part of 'model plan of the after- use of the Olympic Village/Paralympic Village'. Two fifty-story residential skyscrapers are to be built post-event. A school and fire station are also later planned. Village plaza Within the Village is a plaza with a general store, caf√©, and media centre. Operation BATON (Building Athletes' Village with Timber Of the Nation) will see the plaza structure made of 40,000 pieces of donated wood to demonstrate sustainability, and later the woods will be returned to municipalities for reuse in local facilities. Concerns With the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic deferring the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games by twelve months, there were calls for the Olympic Village to be temporarily used as a homeless shelter. With the Games' deferment, concerns were raised that some of the properties had already been sold to developers, and units sold to owners who were set to move in after the September 2020 event conclusion. The post-event apartment supply is estimated as 30% annual supply of all of Tokyo's wards, and this may be greater than can be accommodated by the market. Being not new, the properties may not sell at a premium price. Limited transport options may also reduce desirability as a new residential area.

It is a Scheduled Monument. History Alkmonton is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, as Alchementune; it was held under Henry de Ferrers. There were 8 villagers and 7 smallholders. In 1332 the tax quota was comparable to its neighbours. In about 1100, when the manor was held by Robert de Bakepuze, a hospital for female lepers was built, dedicated to Saint Leonard. It was refounded in 1406, leprosy having died out, by the widow of Sir Walter Blount, who held the manor. His descendant Walter Blount, 1st Baron Mountjoy (died 1474) willed that a chapel, dedicated to Saint Nicholas, should be built at Alkmonton, and that the master of the hospital should say Mass there each year on the feast of St Nicholas. The hospital and chapel were abolished during the reign of Edward VI. Earthworks The earthworks, thought to be the entirety of the medieval village, are south of the present- day village of Alkmonton, on a south-west facing slope, next to Alkmonton Old Hall Farm to the south.

Initially planned as a horse-drawn railway, it was operated as the Decauville railway with steam locomotives. Railway operations were stopped in 1962. Today a metro line connects Tehran with Rey. Narrow- gauge railway Tehran ‚Äì Rey  Horse-drawn tram  First horse-drawn tram in Tehran, c. 1880 Horse-drawn tram stop in Tehran, c. 1890 In January 1859 a Persian delegation travelled to Vienna on behalf of Naser al-Din Shah to conclude a consular treaty between Tehran and Vienna and to recruit talented craftsmen and engineers for the industrialization of Persia. Prime Minister Amir Kabir had started his reform and industrialization program and founded Dar o-Fonun in 1851, the first technical university in Iran based on the western model. The Austro-Hungarian railway engineer, Albert Joseph Gasteiger Freiherr von Ravenstein and Kobach (de) was approached and enthusiastically accepted the order to build a railway in Persia. He learned Persian language on Polytechnic Institute (de) in Vienna in 6 months [1], then he left Vienna on July 17, 1860 and reached Tehran on September 30. When he arrived in Tehran, he quickly realized that he had been mistaken in his opinion about the culture of the Persians. \\"In Europe at that time people still believed to find a country from the Arabian Nights here, but in reality it was a broken state that was completely devastated.\\" [2] This was due to the apparent disinterest of the Qajar rulers to develop the country and instead only think about increasing their own wealth. In February 1861, Gasteiger began surveying a horse-drawn tram from Tehran to Shah Abdol-Azim Shrine in Rey, nine kilometers away, a much-visited place of pilgrimage. He calculated the cost of building the railway with a deployment of 1,000 men and a construction period of three months at 18,000 tomans. Gasteiger hadn't expected what would happen next. \\"A senior Persian official clapped his hands over his head and said that he had undoubtedly miscalculated and that the cost would have to be 30,000 tomans, otherwise it would be preferable to abandon the whole thing.\\" [3] Gasteiger remained steadfast in his calculations and refused to include the bribes for the court official in his calculations, and so the railroad project was put on hold for the next 25 years. Concession and construction of the railway First steam-powered locomotive on the narrow-gauge railway from Tehran to Rey - in service Current condition of the railway locomotive In December 1886 the project was offered to the French engineer Fabius Boital, who first signed a concession agreement with Naser al-Din Shah for the construction and operation of a steam-powered Decauville narrow-gauge railway. The Shah's court had meanwhile come to the conclusion that it would be much more convenient, instead of developing industry and business themselves, to conclude concession agreements with foreign companies and to concentrate on collecting concession income. Boital monetized the concession, which included the right to build and operate railroads throughout Persia for 99 years, and sold it to the Belgian entrepreneur Edouard Otlet (fr), that his son Paul Otlet, became known as the founder of modern information science. Edouard Otlet founded the Soci√©t√© Anonyme des Chemins de Fer et Tramways en Perse on May 17, 1887 with a share capital of 2 million francs. Edouard Otlet had started building and operating private railways across Europe. On May 20, 1876, he received the order from King Ludwig II of Bavaria to build a horse-drawn railway in Munich. In 1878, Otlet founded the Belgian Soci√©te Anonyme des Tramways de Munich for this purpose. Only after much back and forth did the Munich magistrate decide to apply for Otlet and grant him a 30-year license. He then had to pay 1% of his gross income to the municipality for the use of urban roadside. After a dispute with the Munich city council, Otlet was forced to sell his company to the German M√ºnchener Trambahn-Aktiengesellschaft (MTAG) in the same year, which later became the Munich Municipal Transport Company.[4] Railway operation In Persia, Otlet expected high profits. Since about 300,000 pilgrims visited the Shrine of Abdol-Azim annually, it seemed obvious to start building this route. A track width of 800 mm was chosen and a single-track stretch was laid from the Tehran bazaar to near the shrine in Rey. In Tehran, a small train station (fa) was built with three waiting rooms, one for men and one for women, with a hall in between for the Shah. The line was completed on May 31, 1888, and rail operations began in July 1888. [5] The railway staff consisted of 5 European and 60 Persian employees. The locals called the railway mashin doodi (smoke machine) and the station gar mashin' after the French gare'. Instead of using the train, the pilgrims preferred to walk the 9 kilometers from Tehran to Rey as before, so that the whole enterprise became a financial disaster. The Belgian managing directors complained to Naser al-Din Shah and persuaded him to demonstratively take the train together with high court and military officials. As he was ultimately involved in the income of the railway through the concession, he agreed. Naser al-Din Shah's advertising tour was initially a complete success and the railway finally found the popularity expected by the investors. However, some pilgrim accidents and a mullah who died on the railway were soon to provoke the anger of the clergy. The railway was denigrated as \\"satanic\\" and its use demonized. For the Belgians, the investment did not pay off and they decided not to build further lines. Only with Reza Shah was the construction of new railway lines resumed. The Trans-Iranian Railway, built during his reign, brought about the breakthrough for a rail-based transport system in Iran. From 1901, the train from Tehran to Rey no longer ran on a regular schedule. In 1962, rail operations were finally stopped. See also * Railway in Iran * Tehran Metro Sources *1.

It has traditionally been used for making candles. This product must be distiguished from stillingia oil, that is extracted from the seeds of those trees. The name of the substance was given when the two plants were classified in the genus Stillingia, with binomial names \\"Stillingia sebifera\\" and \\"Stillingia discolor\\". Sometime prior to 1950 the species were reclassified in the genus Sapium, and articles from the 1950s still use the names \\"Sapium sebiferum\\" and \\"Sapium discolor\\" However, since about 2002 the plants have been reclassified again in the genus Triadica, and the second one had its species name changed to \\"cochinchinensis\\". The fruit of T. sebifera has a characteristic trilobed shape and contains three seeds surrounded by a fibrous waxy coating, which contains the vegetable tallow fat. The seeds produce 20-30% w/w of tallow fat and 10-17% w/w of stillingia oil. Composition Stillingia tallow is essentially a mixture of triglycerides (esters of glycerol and fatty acids). The main triglycerides are glicerotriyl tripalmitate (5-30%) and 2-oleate,1,3-dipalmitate (~70%). Uses The \\"tallow\\" is reported to be edible, and may have applications in confectionery. However, it is not commonly used for that purpose; and the risk of contamination by the seed oil, which is toxic, is a possible concern. References S. A.

It uses footage shot between 1937 and 1940 by R.G.H Manley, and edited 50 years later by Annie Collins and director Merata Mita. Original footage In 1937, in anticipation of the 1940 centennial celebrations, MƒÅori leader Princess Te Puea commissioned seven waka taua (war canoes), in an attempt to recreate the legendary seven canoes of the MƒÅori migration, though only three were built due to funding shortages. Stills photographer R.G.H ‚ÄúJim‚Äù Manley was asked to film the process, from the felling of massive trees to the maiden voyage. The filming also met financial hurdles and never entered post-production. The waka named NgƒÅtokimatawhaorua was ultimately launched on Waitangi Day, 6 February, 1940. It is launched every February and is housed at the Waitangi Treaty Grounds. The other two waka, Tumanako and Te Rangatahi, are located at T≈´rangawaewae and sail annually during the T≈´rangawaewae Regatta. Reconstruction In 1983, the New Zealand Film Archive began restoring the footage. Merata Mita joined the project in August 1989, editing the film on location at T≈´rangawaewae Marae so that the materials could be handled with traditional blessing practices, and to allow elders originally present in the 1930s to advise. As the original film was almost completely silent, the soundtrack was created from scratch based on the remembrances of these elders. Disagreements between Mita and the family of R.G.H Manley over the direction of the film came to a head after an early workprint screening, when family members took the workprint from the projection booth. A period of mediation occurred afterwards, though contention over the ownership of the original footage persists. Mana Waka premiered at Auckland‚Äôs Civic Theatre on January 21, 1990. Its next public screening was twenty-one years later at the 2011 New Zealand International Film Festival.

He is particularly interested in the potential musicality of sounds and the exploration of sound in all its dimensions. Textures, rhythms and harmonies are derived from noises by sound synthesis and then processed in compositions. Through fundamental processes, e.g. time parameters, dynamic changes through compression and the possibility to play back recordings, recorded sounds are changed, i.e. processed. This approach can be described in musicological terms as \\"compositional sound synthesis\\".Attila Kornel: (Er-)Finding the music - compositional sound synthesis with Simon Stockhausen, in MusikTexte, Zeitschrift f√ºr neue Musik, issue 146, August 2015, edited by Gisela Gronemeyer, Frank Hilberg and others, . He uses found sounds as material to create music in which the boundaries between pop, jazz, electronics and new music dissolve. The preparation of the material with the help of compositional sound synthesis has long been part of the composition process of a music that can detach language from its message and make sounds musical.

She moved to Hampshire where she was a County Councillor and that county's first woman alderman. Life Chamberlain was born in 1870 in Edgbaston. Her parents were Florence (born Kenrick) and Joseph Chamberlain. Her father was a leading statesman and he had been married before. Her mother and namesake Florence died in childbirth in 1875 and her elder half sister Beatrice became her de facto parent. She was educated at Marie Souvestre's Allenswood Boarding Academy together with her younger sisters, Hilda and Ethel. In 1911 she was involved in establishing a social service at Birmingham General Hospital in the shape of an almoner helping her elder brother Neville who was Chair of the hospital's house committee. In 1914 her father died after being paralysed from a stroke for seven years. She and Hilda gave up their own aspirations and social life to care for him. He left ¬£20,000 to each of his daughters and she decided to buy a house with her sister Hilda. They bought the Bury House (now Grade two listed) in Odiham which dated from the 1600s and had good transport links to London. At the new house at Christmas 1914 they began to plan new works. Ida's initial work was to help her elder half sister Beatrice with assistance for the wounded. In February 1918 she was elected to a public position as a councillor on Harley Wintney Rural District Council. She had experience working for the Odiham branch of the Growers Co-operative Union, the French Wounded Emergency Fund in London and the Belgravia War Hospital Supply Depot. As a Harley Wintney councillor she led the housing committee. In 1925 she was elected as a county councillor to Hampshire county council where she took a special interest in both health and housing. This was useful to her brother Neville Chamberlain who was leading the Ministry of Health as county council's were a key part of his plans and he consulted with Ida and her sister Hilda. In 1931 she became the first woman alderman of Hampshire. She and Hilda were concerned about the military threat posed by Hitler's rise to power in Germany and they tried to influence Neville as Prime Minister. In 1939 war broke out and Neville soon resigned. Ida turned her attentions to helping with food supply as Britain's imports were impeded by German attacks on UK shipping.

He was an early advocate for the teaching of tropical medicine in British medical schools, and was the author of many publications, mostly related to aspects of tropical medicine.  Early life  Born in Kinneff, Scotland, on 22 August 1836, Andrew Davidson was the son of a shoemaker, John Davidson, and his wife, Margaret Cobban.Scotland Old Parish Registers, Baptism No 262/4070, 8 September 1836, Kinneff & CatterlineScotland, Statutory Marriage No 685/04 0068 As a teenager, he worked as an assistant bookseller in Montrose,1851 Census of England, Wales & ScotlandThe Stonehaven Journal, 25 December 1862, page 3 but later studied medicine at Edinburgh University. He lived in the nearby home of the medical missionary, William Burns Thomson,1861 Census of England, Wales & Scotland (Cowgate, Edinburgh) who had just established a busy dispensary where he and other students helped out when their study commitments allowed. Soon after graduating, Davidson was married in Edinburgh in March 1862 to Christina McDonald, the daughter of a merchant from Laurencekirk, David McDonald.Scotland, Statutory Marriage No 685/04 0068  Life in Madagascar  Less than a month after being married, Davidson and his wife became members of the first team from the London Missionary Society being sent to Madagascar. Europeans were expelled from the island almost three decades earlier . A new King, Radama II, had invited missionaries to return,Leonardi, Cherry. Laying the First Course of Stones: Building the London Missionary Society Church in Madagascar, 1862-1895, The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol 36 (3), 2003, pages 607-633 but when Davidson arrived in the capital, Antananarivo, the majority of Madagascar‚Äôs people had no previous exposure to European medicine or its principles. One of Davidson‚Äôs colleagues would later recall that he made an instant impression with a successful cataract operation by restoring sight to a woman who had ‚Äúlong been blind‚Äù. Locals believing he could work miracles turned up a few days later outside his home with a corpse, hoping he could bring a deceased person back to life, but then realised his limitations. Davidson was soon running a busy clinic in Antananarivo, opening a dispensary for two hours every day then visiting the sick in their homes. In a letter to William Burns Thomson, he said that although French doctors had tried to introduce themselves to the King, he‚Äôd been appointed Court Physician, and been given the Order of Radama ‚Äúfor my successful treatment of his son‚Äù . By early 1864, Davidson had received royal permission to begin building Madagascar‚Äôs first hospital, not far from his home in the capital. After a trip back to Britain at end of 1866, Davidson cut his ties with the LMS but with more funding provided through Thomson he returned to Madagascar and began an intensive campaign of educating local medical missionary students in the use of chemical equipment and prepared medical texts in Malagasy, including works on pharmacy, chemistry and midwifery. Both Davidson and Thomson saw the training of medical students as an extension of their missionary work, and their plans were advanced when Queen Ranavalona II became monarch of Madagascar in 1868. According to Thomson, Davidson helped to encourage the Queen and thousands of her people to convert to Christianity. She gave Davidson permission to open the Malagasy Medical Mission College, where he taught physiology, while others taught anatomy, English, chemistry, ‚Äúnatural philosophy‚Äù, algebra and geometry and ‚ÄúBible knowledge‚Äù. Three of Davidson‚Äôs students were brought to Edinburgh by Thomson. One died before passing his preliminary examination, but the other two went home as the first Madagascan medical practitioners with internationally-recognised qualifications. With the help of a nurse sent from Scotland by Thomson, by 1874 Davidson had also trained two batches of women as ‚Äúmissionary nurses‚Äù or midwives. ‚ÄúI know of no mission that has exerted so great an influence on the destinies of a nation as the Medical Mission, under Dr Davidson, in Madagascar,‚Äù Thomson later reflected.Burns Thomson, William (1895), Reminiscences of Medical Missionary Work, pages 157-170 As well as practising medicine and teaching in Madagascar, Davidson would also devote time to writing scholarly articles. One related to an outbreak of ‚Äúchoreomania‚Äù or a ‚Äúdancing disease‚Äù which swept through Madagascar in 1863, affecting large numbers of people and causing widespread turmoil.Davidson, A., & Royal College of Surgeons of England. (1867). Choreomania, an historical sketch: With some account of an epidemic observed in Madagascar. (Medical Heritage Library) Edinburgh: Printed by Oliver and Boyd. In 1864, he wrote ‚ÄúTubercular leprosy in Madagascar‚Äù for the Edinburgh Medical Journal.Davidson, A. (January 1, 1864). An Account of Tubercular Leprosy in the Island of Madagascar. Edinburgh Medical Journal, 10, 1, 33-42. In 1867, he wrote an article on a recently-abolished Madagascan practice of ‚Äútrial by poisoning‚Äù.Davidson, A. (1874). An account, historical and physiological, of the Madagascar ordeal poison, the Tanghinia venenifera. London. Davidson‚Äôs time in Madagascar would come to an end in 1876 after a dispute with the Prime Minister, Rainilaiarivony. According to fellow British missionary, John Alden Houlder, the dispute apparently began because Rainilaiarivony ‚Äúfelt aggrieved because of some real or fancied neglect of the Queen or himself‚Äù. The already ‚Äúthoroughly angry‚Äù Prime Minister and his friends then became ‚Äúfurious‚Äù when Davidson backed moves to make wealthy families pay something for previously free medical services. Rainilaiarivony called a mass meeting, told the thousands of people who attended to boycott Davidson, took away his students and assistants, and placed spies around his house, making it ‚Äúpositively dangerous‚Äù for any local or foreigner to go near him. ‚ÄúIt was, however, all to no purpose,‚Äù Houlder recorded. ‚ÄúThe doctor never budged an inch, nor showed the slightest sign of bowing down to the great man.‚Äù Nevertheless, the ‚Äúpersecution‚Äù did eventually become unbearable and Davidson left Madagascar after securing employment in the nearby British colony of Mauritius.Houlder, J. A. (1912). Among the Malagasy. James Clarke & Co. London.  Life in Mauritius  Over the next few years, Davidson‚Äôs positions in the Mauritian Civil Medical Service would include Visiting and Superintending Surgeon of the Civil Hospital, and Superintendent of the Lunatic Asylum. He would assist inquiries and then publish reports on leprosy, malaria, ‚Äúacute anaemic dropsy‚Äù, epizootic diseases, and public sanitation. As well, he would prepare a synopsis of reports and papers from Mauritius for the International Colonial Exhibition in Amsterdam in 1883,Toussaint, A., & Adolphe, H. (1956).

As an author, editor, and lecturer  When he returned to Britain with Christina in about 1892, Davidson produced his first major work: Geographical pathology: an inquiry into the geographical distribution of infective and climatic diseases,Davidson, A. (1892). Geographical pathology: an inquiry into the geographical distribution of infective and climatic diseases. Edinburgh & London: Y.J. Pentland. covering Europe and large parts of Asia. In 1893, he produced another major text: Hygiene and diseases of warm climates.Davidson, A. (1893). Hygiene and diseases of warm climates. Edinburgh: Pentland. Davidson edited the book and was the sole author of two chapters on two little-understood diseases that were claiming thousands of lives each year in the tropics, malaria and dengue fever. However, most chapters were contributed by other senior medical figures in Europe, Africa and the USA. A review in the British Medical Journal criticised aspects of the book, but said it was still the best work on the subject so far published in any language, and should be ‚Äúthe daily companion of every medical man in warm countries‚Äù.Review (1894).

For the next few years the professional paths of the pair would overlap as they both sought to lift the profile of tropical medicine in Britain. In an address in 1897, Manson told his audience he was in part drawing on notes provided by Davidson, who he described as having judgement and knowledge that matched ‚Äúvery great‚Äù experience in tropical medicine. He quoted Davidson as having said that every British medical school should have ‚Äúlectures on the hygiene and diseases of warm climates‚Äù, and that appointments of government medical officers in tropical and sub-tropical colonies should be restricted to those with a certificate of qualification in tropical medicine. ‚ÄúI have called in a specialist of experience to prescribe,‚Äù Manson said, in relating the quotes. ‚ÄúI need hardly say I fully endorse his prescription.‚ÄùManson, P.

Nevertheless, Manson used his book to outline his theory ‚Äì later proven to be correct - that malaria in humans was transmitted by mosquitoes. The following year, Manson became the founder of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. A few months later, in May 1900, Davidson became Edinburgh University‚Äôs first lecturer in ‚Äúdiseases of tropical climates‚Äù.The Scotsman, 15 March 1899 page 11 He remained at the university until his retirement in 1907, teaching students from Britain and across the world, including Africa, Asia and Australasia.The Scotsman, 6 January 1908, page 10The Edinburgh University Calendar 1905-1906, pages 564-5  Death and family  On 13 January 1918, Andrew Davidson diedGeneral Register Office; United Kingdom; Volume: 9a; Page: 219 at the home in Ilkley, Yorkshire of his daughter Flora (1867-1950), 16 days after the death there of Christina,General Register Office; United Kingdom; Volume: 9a; Page: 218 his wife of 56 years.

It was Manson who would end up being widely hailed as the ‚Äúfather of tropical medicine‚Äù. Nevertheless, at an event to mark the 50th anniversary of the Scottish branch of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 1980, Davidson was named as one of 33 Scots born between 1721 and 1869 who had made significant contributions to tropical medicine. Particular mention was made of his role in establishing the school of tropical medicine at Edinburgh University.Wright, F. J. (January 01, 1981).

She was active from 1990 to 2010. Initially a jeweller, she moved towards \\"purely sculptural forms\\" from the late 1990s.  Biography  Funaki was born in Matsue, Shimane, Japan. She moved to Australia in 1979 and studied painting and gold and silversmithing at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT). In 1995 Funaki exhibited containers, containers for candles and gold jewellery in her exhibition Marie Funaki Metalwork in at the Crafts Council for the ACT. Work from this exhibition caught the attention of and was acquired by the new assistant curator of Australian decorative arts, Jim Logan. Funaki was known for her distinctive arthropod-like brooches, rings and bracelets, which later merged into her large scale geometric sculptural works, some up to 6 metres tall. She started Gallery Funaki, Melbourne in 1995. The gallery was regarded as one of the \\"key world jewellery spaces\\" showcasing the work of leading Australian and international jewellers. In 2009, the Art Gallery of Western Australia held a solo exhibition Marie Funaki Works 1992-2009. Funaki produced a number of new works for this exhibition. The catalogue description of the exhibition explained: > \\"There is always a sense of danger in her work, as the spindly legs of her > insect-like containers support unlikely, unwieldy torsos, and as her rings > and bracelets cultivate miniature monoliths that play with scale and weight > in fascinating ways\\". In 2010, the National Gallery of Australia commissioned Funaki to create a sculpture for the entrance to the new Stage 1 building which included the Australian indigenous art galleries and the southern entrance. The sculpture Twilight was created in aluminium and finished with black polymer paint. Inspired by the pukumani burial poles of the Tiwi Islands, Funaki said of this work: > \\"I like to make my forms stir people‚Äôs emotions or imagination. As an object > maker I have always been interested in the interplay and dialogue between > negative and positive, between volume and space, between inside and > outside.\\" During the final stages of creating this sculpture with fabricator Robert Hook, Funaki became unwell and died in May 2010 after a long battle with cancer. A survey exhibition of her work was held at the National Gallery of Victoria in late 2010 Marie Funaki: Objects. The exhibition followed her work from the late 1990s to 2010, mapping her development from gold and mild steel wearable objects to pure sculpture. The exhibition highlighted Funaki's \\"brilliant inventiveness with line, mass, volume and space across various sculptural forms.\\" Her geometric sculptures were described as \\"gravity defying\\" Funaki‚Äôs jewellery, objects and sculptures are held in private and public collections including the National Gallery of Australia, the Powerhouse Museum, the National Gallery of Victoria and Die Neue Sammlung in Munich.

His adventurousness deserves kudos ‚Äî but this band‚Äôs execution needs work.\\" Scott Yanow of AllMusic wrote, \\"This set is a bit of a departure for pianist Jacky Terrasson who has generally been heard in acoustic trio formats... Overall, this set is open to the influences of world music and more funk-oriented jazz, yet Jacky Terrasson still sounds quite creative, explorative and individual. An intriguing program.\\" Geoffrey Himes of The Washington Post added, \\"the Parisian pianist has often been a prisoner of his own virtuosity, compelled to prove how many notes he could play in a chorus rather than how much emotion. By concentrating on more obvious melodies and by experimenting with different arrangements, Terrasson has broken out of that prison and expressed himself as never before.\\" Track listingPersonnel *Jacky Terrasson ‚Äì acoustic piano *Rick Centalonza ‚Äì flute, oboe *Adam Rogers ‚Äì guitar *Fernando Saunders ‚Äì electric bass *Mino Cinelu ‚Äì drums, percussion *Ugonna Okegwo ‚Äì acoustic bass *Jaz Sawyer ‚Äì drums *Richard Bona ‚Äì electric bass *Jay Collins ‚Äì flute *Gregoire Maret ‚Äì harmonica *Michael Brecker ‚Äì tenor saxophone *Xiomara Laugarts ‚Äì vocals References Category:1999 albums Category:Jacky Terrasson albums Category:Blue Note Records albums ","title":"What It Is (Jacky Terrasson album)"},{"id":"65132630","text":"Portrait from Ghent Cathedral Carolus van den Bosch (1597‚Äì1665) was a clergyman in the Habsburg Netherlands who served successively as bishop of Bruges (1651‚Äì1660) and bishop of Ghent (1660‚Äì1665).

It is now in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 364. The painting was bought from Charles Sedelmeyer in 1895 by the director of the Strasbourg museum, Wilhelm von Bode, and entered the collections two years later. As of 2014, it was the only Dutch painting of that kind (schuttersstuk; English: \\"militia piece\\") in a French museum. The painting depicts a banquet of 46 men in arms from the voluntary civic guard of Haarlem. The scene takes place in the civic guard meeting hall, and that is where the painting probably used to hang until the 18th century. One of these faces is supposed to be a self-portrait of Engelsz. Due to its size ‚Äì The St Adrian Civic Guard is by far the largest Old Master painting in the Strasbourg collection ‚Äì the painting could not be evacuated during World War II and was severely damaged when Palais Rohan was hit during an Anglo-American bombing raid on 11 August 1944. Poor post-war restoration work made the damage even worse, and Engelsz.' painting disappeared from sight until late 2008, when a partnership was launched between the museum and BNP Paribas in order to restore it for good. After five years of work, the restored painting was then revealed to the public in early 2014. The style of the painting is inspired by Cornelis van Haarlem and does seem archaic next to Frans Hals's The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1616, which revolutionized the genre by its liveliness and dynamism. Following that example, Engelsz.' next schuttersstuk, The Banquet of the Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1618 (in the collection of the Frans Hals Museum), would then look nothing like the Strasbourg painting.

Canaway.https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28482322-the-grey-seas-of-jutland Plot introduction Two cousins, one British and one German, join their country‚Äôs Naval forces and fall in love with the same girl. Their ongoing rivalry comes to a head in the thick of the Great War, when their ships close for action in the Battle of Jutland. The Author points out that no destroyer named Nilotic took part in the Jutland action, and that no capital ship named Sachsen was involved. He acknowledges a debt of gratitude to Captain Geoffrey Bennett, Royal Navy. The book is divided into two major sections; Time Growing and Time Fighting. Plot At the beginning of the 1900‚Äôs, George Wynne is growing up in his Father‚Äôs Herefordshire rectory. He is intended for the Church, but a chance encounter with a sailor sets him on the track of a naval career. George meets his German cousin, Werner Stelling who is inspired by George to also aim for a naval career. They both fall in love with their beautiful but wayward American cousin, Claire Edwardes. The cousins go through their country‚Äôs naval colleges and are commissioned. George proposes marriage to Claire, but she evades the issue, eventually confessing to a long-standing sexual affair with a young farmhand on the family estate. George is horrified, but does not tell Claire of his own experience with a prostitute in the London docklands. George‚Äôs sister June is married to a local farmer. After the celebrations, Claire‚Äôs Mother, who is going through a divorce, makes clumsy drunken advances to George. She reveals that Claire has loved only Werner. By the start of the Great War, George is a Lieutenant, and Werner is a Leutnant zur See. May 1916 finds George in command of HMS Nilotic, a torpedo destroyer, part of a flotilla steaming out of the Firth of Forth into the North Sea. The flotilla will join the Grand Fleet under Admiral Jellicoe, which will shortly be involved in the Battle of Jutland. Werner is serving aboard the battleship Sachsen, part of the German High Seas Fleet commanded by Admiral Scheer. Nilotic is soon in the thick of the fighting. George uses a brief respite to re-read a letter from Claire; she has married another man. Then a lookout spots the Sachsen. Consumed with rage, George deliberately disobeys orders and alters course to intercept the Sachsen. In the ensuing action, both of the ships are critically damaged and most of the George‚Äôs crew are killed. George is forced to abandon ship, but not before firing his last torpedo at the German ship. Both George and Werner find themselves in the water; George tries to kill Werner with his remaining strength, but fails. The cousins are rescued by a Swedish ship. Headed for internment, a kind of peace is made between them.

In such a scheme, users encrypt their files locally and send them encrypted to the cloud service provider (CSP). Hence, the CSP who does not have access to the encryption key cannot learn anything about the content of users' data. Furthermore, whenever users wish to access their files, they can search directly over the encrypted data for specific keywords. A problem with SSE schemes is that the revocation of a user cannot be implemented efficiently since sharing an encrypted file implies sharing the underlying encryption key. As a result, if a data owner wishes to revoke a user, then all files that are encrypted with the same key must be decrypted and then re-encrypted under a fresh key.

Economic cooperation  In September 2009, the two governments signed an agreement to eliminate double taxation. During the talks between the Minister of industry and energy of Azerbaijan Natig Aliyev and the Minister of industry and energy of Syria Sufyan Allau, which were held in the capital city of Damascus on March 4, 2010, a Memorandum of intent was signed to conclude an agreement on gas supplies. There was also a Protocol signed on the mutual exchange of experience, training of qualified personnel, and the establishment of a joint Azerbaijani-Syrian company. On November 23, 2010, the parties entered into an agreement on the technical details of the purchase of natural gas for a period of 20 years. In December 2011, Azerbaijan began exporting natural gas to Syria via Turkey and Georgia. The Azerbaijani government plans to allocate approximately 5-10 billion dollars for investment in the Syrian economy. In 2018, it was announced that the chairmen of Azerbaijani companies wish to participate in various tenders, the main purpose of which is the reconstruction of oil and gas pipelines, roads, etc. on the territory of Syria. The two countries cooperate in a number of areas: energy, mining, agriculture, tourism, trade, science, education, health, ecology, construction, and so on.  Tourism  The citizens of Azerbaijan have the opportunity to obtain a visa at the border with Syria. The validity period of the visa is 15 days.  International cooperation  Syria has once supported Azerbaijan's position on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. However, since the Syrian Civil War, Syria has been accused of supporting Armenia, Azerbaijan's arch-rival. Both countries are members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). Syria and Azerbaijan cooperate within the framework of the United Nations (UN), Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), etc.  Cultural ties  Since the twentieth century, the two countries have been cooperating in book publishing. The society for friendship and cultural relations operates in Damascus.  Humanitarian assistance  On December 7-18, 2015, with the financial support of the International Development Agency of the Republic of Azerbaijan (AIDA) and the organization of the Embassy of the Republic of Azerbaijan in Jordan, humanitarian aid was distributed to 400 Syrian families settled in Jordan, including food and health products.

Wanless (194015 December 2017) was a British arachnologist. Active in the field especially in the seventies and eighties of the 20th century, he described several dozen taxa, in particular among the spiders of the Salticidae family. Wanless played a significant role in the British Arachnological Society being its member in 1969‚Äì1973, 1974‚Äì1976 and 1986‚Äì1989, and Meetings Secretary in 1973‚Äì1978. From 1973 to 1988 he described 137 new species and 13 new genera.  Career  He worked at the Natural History Museum in London, dealing with the arachnid collections and at the Australian Museum in Brisbane. At the Museum Wanless developed interest in African jumping spiders while editing Doug Clark‚Äôs notes and later working on their collaborative paper. During his work at the Museum he published a number of academic papers and supervised the studies of post-graduate students. Wanless played a significant role in the British Arachnological Society being its member in 1969‚Äì1973, 1974‚Äì1976 and 1986‚Äì1989, and Meetings Secretary in 1973‚Äì1978. From 1973 to 1988 Wanless described 137 new species and 13 new genera. Among them only nine species (7%) have been later synonymized, while all his genera and the subfamily Spartaeinae remain valid. Wanless traveled extensively as part of his research working notably in Borneo and Botswana. In 1977, he joined the Royal Geographical Society‚Äôs expedition to Gunung Mulu National Park in Sarawak where he collected and described local species. Wanless retired from the National History Museum in 2003, however he continued studying grasses and sedges publishing a guide on them in 2013.

The Merv Hardie, named for politician, businessman and bush pilot Merv Hardie, was a ferry that connected the eastern and western portions of the Yellowknife Highway, across the Mackenzie River, near Fort Providence. She was retired in late 2012 when the Deh Cho Bridge, the first road bridge across the Mackenzie, was completed. The Mackenzie River ices up for months of the year. Depending on conditions the ferry was able to cross, when the ice was relatively thin. Ice dams could lower water levels, making crossings impossible. When the ice grew thick enough, an ice bridge was maintained, capable of allowing the crossing of the largest vehicles. Following her last crossing at Fort Providence the Northern Journal interviewed John Mikula, who had served as one of the ferry's captains. Mikula, who had served as a captain for 17 years, told the Northern Journal that when crew member's previous contracts had come up for renewal they had only been offered contracts that classified them as casual workers, with the result that when the service ended they were not entitled to severance pay, and this had left the workers feeling bitter. In February 2013, several months after she was retired from the Fort Providence crossing, Sonny Blake Jr., member for the Mackenzie Delta riding in the territorial legislature, asked the Minister of Transportation Dave Ramsay, whether the ferry could replace the MV Louis Cardinal, a smaller and less capable ferry operating at Tsiigehtchic, in the delta. Ramsay said the ferry needed maintenance work, but the government would consider putting her in service elsewhere. However, as of 2020 the Merv Hardie had not been returned to service.

It was registered in Poland on December 3, 1990 and since then has the status of a religious association in the territory of the Republic of Poland. In 1991, the Community purchased a detached house with a plot of land in W≈Çochy, Warsaw. The house was converted into a Mission House and mosque premises. The community has around 100 members in Poland The history of the Community dates back to the interwar period. In 1937 , the first missionary, Ayyaz Khan, came to Warsaw with two co-workers of Hungarian citizenship. He came under the direct command of the spiritual leader of the Worldwide Head of Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmoud Ahmad. The reason for sending the missionary to Poland was a personal visit in 1937, to the central headquarters of the Ahmadiyya Muslim World Community, in Qadian, India, of the Chief Mufti of Poland, Dr. Jakub Szynkiewicz, head of the Muslim Religious Union in Poland. The purpose of the visit was to interest the Second Caliph in building a mosque in Warsaw and to raise funds for this purpose. The Second Caliph allocated a certain amount to the construction of a mosque in Warsaw and delegated Ayyaz Khan, who had been working in Hungary for two years, to Poland. The outbreak of the Second World War made it impossible to achieve this goal. The hostilities forced the missionary Ayyaz Khan to leave Warsaw and evacuate from Poland. He went to Budapest with the military, government officials, ambassadors and others. He continued his missionary activities in the capital of Hungary. The resumption of the activities of the Association was possible only after the fall of communism in Poland, in 1990. This year, another missionary, Hamid Karim Mahmud, came to Warsaw, who completed the interrupted activities of his predecessor regarding the legalization of the Association's activities in the Republic of Poland. Ahmadiyya Muslim Community was granted the status of a Muslim Religious Union in 1990. It continued its activities for the next 16 years, until 2006.

His close links to the publishing trade over a period of nearly forty years make it likely that he lived in London for most, if not all, of his life. He was strongly influenced by the works of Nicholas Breton and Thomas Deloney, turning to them for inspiration at various points in his career. Price may have performed and sold his ballads himself, which is suggested by Price‚Äôs close relationship with stationer Francis Grove, a prolific producer of cheap print in the 1640s and 1650s, who is known to have employed ballad singers (Bridewell court book 9, p. 645, 1 March 1654.). In the 1650s, with his former friends and acquaintances John Lookes, Martin Parker, and John Taylor all silenced by death, Price reigned supreme as the most popular and prolific writer of the decade. This was reflected in the rare accolade of being frequently named as an author in the Stationers‚Äô registers. In 1656 Price was named as one of the ‚Äòglorious three‚Äô popular writers, alongside Humphrey Crouch and Samuel Smithson. In 1660, the Price and Grove partnership welcomed the restoration of the monarchy with one of the most enduringly popular political ballads of the century, Win at First, Lose at Last. Price wrote across a range of genres, from bawdy song (in his earlier years), to moral exhortation, horror stories, merry tales, and shortened versions of literary classics. Price was a wonderful storyteller, as can be seen from his Witch of the Woodlands (1655) and his re-telling of The Famous History of Valentine and Orson. His uncluttered style was particularly accessible, not only to his seventeenth-century readers, who included women and children‚Äînotably the young and newly enthusiastic Anthony Wood‚Äîbut also to the audiences of later ages. Many of his ballads were continually reprinted over a century or more, including A Warning for All Lewd Livers (1633), A Warning for Married Women Being an Example of Mrs. Jane Reynolds (1657), Flora‚Äôs Farewell (1656), and Win at First (1660). The enduring quality of Price‚Äôs songs is marked by the numerous titles captured by Francis Childs via a nineteenth- century oral tradition, which are still performed and enjoyed today. For example, a more melodramatic version of Price‚Äôs The Famous Flower of Serving Men (1656) was recorded in 1972 by renowned folk-singer Martin Carthy. Price was unswervingly loyal first to the Church of England and second to an unequivocally protestant monarchy. During the interregnum, he attacked the rise of sects, especially Quakers, and bitterly lamented the decline of the church. In his final years, Price concentrated on writing godly pamphlets and sermons, such as The Ready Way to Salvation (1665), which not only appeared regularly in London publishers‚Äô book lists but they were frequently reprinted in colonial America and remained popular for more than a century.

Eisenthal (born 23 March 1933 in New York City) is an American physical chemist. Education and career Eisenthal received a B.S. in chemistry from Brooklyn College. He graduated from Harvard University with an M.A. in physics and a Ph.D. in chemical physics. His doctoral thesis supervisor was Marshall Fixman. As a postdoc, Eisenthal worked at UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles), where he gained experience in molecular spectroscopy in the research group of Mostafa El-Sayed. After his stay at UCLA, Eisenthal briefly worked at The Aerospace Corporation and then at the IBM Almaden Research Center, where he did research in the Chemical Physics Group. The application of lasers in chemistry (laser chemistry) became his main field of work. The development of the picosecond laser in the late 1960s created new possibilities for measuring molecular relaxation processes. Eisenthal made important contributions to the then new field of picosecond- laser spectroscopy. In 1975 he moved to Columbia University, as the holder of a professorship (\\"Mark Hyman Professor of Chemistry\\"). At Columbia University he did fundamental research on free electrons in water, the photochemistry of carbenes, and other photochemical processes (photoisomerization), before his research activities focused on the application of lasers to investigation of the equilibrium and dynamic properties of molecules at liquid interfaces and at solid interfaces. Eisenthal is the author or co-author of more than 200 scientific articles. His co-authors include Nicholas Turro. Eisenthal was a Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 1984‚Äì1985.

It lies close to the Gemmi Pass at Leukerbad and is a strike-slip fault. This fault is at least long and shows evidence of Holocene movement; several landslides and traces of early Holocene earthquakes found in Swiss lakes may correlate to movements along the Gemmi Fault.  Geology = Regional  The Alps were formed by the collision of the Adriatic and European continents and the collision is still underway, with convergence rates of less than . This convergence causes rock uplift and earthquake activity. The western and central Swiss Alps are the fastest rising region of the country, with uplift rates of reached near Brig. A number of recently active fault systems have been identified in the Western Alps, but they often show only subtle signs of movement. Additionally, many faults are caused by gravitational phenomena rather than tectonic processes but the Gemmi Fault is undoubtedly of tectonic origin.  Local  The Gemmi Fault is a northwest‚Äìsoutheast trending strike-slip fault which crops out over a length of and features an offset of at least . It is characterized by a conspicuous, up to high offset in the landscape between the Daubensee northeast of the fault and the Daubenhorn southwest of it. The trace of the fault is perpendicular to the folding trends of the surrounding terrain. A damage zone surrounds the fault trace and is up to wide; it is characterized by broken calcite fragments, cataclasite and veins produced by fluid flow within the fault. Joints in the rock of the area are focused on the fault and show evidence of movement. The fault lies at the bottom of a valley at Gemmi Pass (close to Leukerbad, Valais) between elevation. It cuts through carbonates, sandstones and shales of the Helvetic nappes; the rocks are of Jurassic-Eocene age and were folded during the Oligocene-Miocene. Hot springs at Leukerbad and a Tertiary dyke at the Trubelstock close to the fault indicate elevated geothermal gradients in the ground. The fault was discovered with the help of aerial photography followed by field studies and trenching.  Geologic history  Radiometric dating applied to the calcite in the fault produced ages between 2.5 and 0.5 million years old. Presumably, initial faulting produced fractures that allowed fluid flow and the development of cataclasites, alternating with brittle faulting. Heat flow resulted in the thermal alteration of the host rocks. The Gemmi Fault has offset moraine scree deposits, indicating Quaternary fault activity; this observation was also made during trenching. It has been active in post- glacial time. Luminescence dating has yielded ages of 8,700¬±2,000 and 2,400¬±500 years, which have been interpreted as either two earthquakes or as an upper limit to the age of the last fault movement. This implies that the Gemmi Fault was active during the Holocene. Earthquakes frequently cause multiple rock slides during each event, and a number of such rockslides are documented from Switzerland. Rock slides in the Kander valley and at Rinderhorn appear to be contemporaneous about 9,800-9,600 years ago within dating uncertainty, and sediment deposits within Lake Lucerne and Lake Seelisberg indicate that an earthquake with magnitude exceeding 6 took place 9,870-9,960 years ago. The Gemmi Fault is located within the area and has an earthquake that took place 8,700¬±2,000 years ago; however earthquakes in Switzerland often are not bound to specific fault systems. Climatic triggers of clustered rockslides are possible but speculative. The movement direction of the Gemmi Fault is congruent with the regional tectonic stress field, which is supported by the kinematics of regional earthquakes which form a cluster that lies south of the fault. The magnitude of earthquakes associated with the Gemmi Fault may have reached 5.5-5.8, intensities comparable to these of other earthquakes in Switzerland.

It stretches for about 10 kilometers between the villages of Ayn Bani Sa‚Äôdah (al-Ayn), Qumayrah and Bilt.  Archaeology  In 2015, the Omani-Polish Qumayrah Archaeological Project was created as a result of the cooperation between the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw and the Ministry of National Heritage and Culture of the Sultanate of Oman. It is directed by Prof. Piotr Bieli≈Ñski from the PCMA UW. The valley was surveyed in the late 1990s, but had never been closely investigated by archaeologists before, so the project started with an archaeological reconnaissance. Several dozen sites of different types and periods (from the Stone Age to the Islamic period) were documented. Then the area of excavations was marked out. Since 2016, the research focuses on three sites: a burial site from the Early Bronze Age (QA 1), a Neolithic campsite (QA 2), and a settlement from the Iron and Bronze Ages (QA 3).  Site QA 1 ‚Äì burials  Site QA 1 is a burial site with graves in a stone setting, dating to the Umm an-Nar period (2700/2600‚Äì2000 BC). It was identified in 1998 by Paolo M. Costa, but it was first excavated by the Omani-Polish expedition in 2016. The site encompasses 10 circular graves with diameters ranging from 6 to 11 m. Most of them are located near a modern cemetery and cover an area of approximately 0.4 ha; only one structure lies about 450 m away, near a wadi.  Site QA 2 ‚Äì Neolithic settlement  Site QA 2 is approximately 0.3 ha big. The identified phases of (probably seasonal) settlement date from the Early to the Late Neolithic. Hearths and traces of houses were discovered in test trenches. Research in 2016‚Äì2017 yielded several shell adornments and 2585 stone artifacts, including 576 retouched tools. They were made predominantly of local raw materials: flint, chert and radiolarite.  Site QA 3 ‚Äì Bronze and Iron Ages settlement  QA 3 is the largest of the excavated sites, located near a modern village. A settlement existed here in the Bronze and Iron Ages, and late Islamic layers were also identified. Archaeologists uncovered houses from all the above-mentioned periods as well as a circular tower dated to the Bronze Age. Two other stone towers and further remains of the settlement were discovered south of the site. The layers dated to Iron Age II were also attested at sites QA 20 and QA 21, and seem to belong to a single settlement.  References  * Bia≈Çowarczuk, M., Szymczak, A.

Biography He was born in Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, and by the 1850s was performing in music halls around the country. In 1856 he was billed as \\"the greatest Buffo Comic Singer in England\\". His songs included \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\", \\"I‚Äôve Joined the Teetotal Society\\", \\"That Blessed Baby\\", and \\"The Great Sensation Song\\", but his reputation rests on \\"The Perfect Cure\\".Richard Anthony Baker, British Music Hall: an illustrated history, Pen & Sword, 2014, , pp.15-16 The song was written by Frederick C. Perry, to a tune by Jonathan Blewitt which had previously been used for another song, \\"The Monkey and the Nuts\\". The phrase \\"perfect cure\\" was a slang term at the time for a \\"curiosity\\", or eccentric person.Bob Davenport, \\"J. H. Stead: ‚ÄòThe Perfect Cure‚Äô\\", Studied Monuments. Retrieved 28 August 2020 The song's opening verse (out of ten) and chorus went: :Young Love he plays some funny tricks with us unlucky elves, :So gentlemen, I pray look out, and take care of yourselves, :For once I met a nice young maid, looking so demure, :All at once to me she said, 'You‚Äôre a perfect cure ‚Ä¶' ::A cure, a cure, a cure, a cure, ::Now isn‚Äôt I a cure, ::For here I go, ::My high gee wo [i.e. horse], ::For I‚Äôm a perfect cure.... In his early performances of the song, Stead wore \\"a long black coat, large white neckcloth, gaiters, and large rimmed low black hat; in fact the costume of a French cur√© ‚Äì the chorus being sung after the Quaker fashion, with the raising and lowering of the body. It was very funny, and he used to meet with great applause‚Ä¶\\". Later, he dressed in a striped suit and dunce's cap like a French circus clown. Mary Fermor, \\"Popular Songs of the Past\\", The Royal Magazine, vol.6, pp.276-277 Alfred Rosling Bennett wrote that, when Stead performed the song, \\"he sprang a couple of feet in the air at every bar, and never paused for some ten minutes. The words were the merest drivel, the attraction consisting solely in the eccentric appearance of the singer, his antics, agility and endurance.\\" Alfred Rosling Bennett, London and Londoners in the Eighteen-Fifties and Sixties, 1924, p.66, 187 In each chorus, he would jump several times into the air, stiff-legged like a marionette, his arms held closely to his side. He is said to have jumped up and down 400 times in each performance, and sometimes performed it in four different venues in the course of one night. Bennett wrote that, around 1860, Stead's performances \\"raged through the land like influenza\\". In 1869, Henry C. Lunn of The Musical Times reviewed his performance: > Mr. J. H. Stead ‚Ä¶ sang and danced the composition which has made his > reputation ‚Äì the ‚ÄòPerfect Cure.‚Äô Mr. Stead is usually described as ‚Äòthe man > who never stood still;‚Äô and indeed, seeing that he has jumped into so good a > thing, there is no reason why he should relax his efforts as long as the > public will pay to see him, and his muscular system will hold out. > Abstractedly, there is nothing either pleasing or amusing in seeing a full- > grown man, in a striped suit and an eccentric cap, bounding up and down like > an India-rubber ball, whilst he is trying to sing. But it is clever, > nevertheless; and, although we do not sympathise with his ‚Äòline of > endeavour,‚Äô as Carlyle says, we can at least praise him for his industry. Stead continued to perform the song into the early 1880s. His success led to the production of trick puppets in his likeness, for use in travelling shows, dancing to the tune of \\"The Perfect Cure\\". The tune itself became a popular fiddle tune at barn dances, often thought of incorrectly as a traditional Norfolk jig. Katie Howson, \\"Tracing a Tune No.1 ‚Äì The Perfect Cure\\", East Anglian Traditional Music Trust. Retrieved 28 August 2020 Stead became ill with a chest condition in 1884, developed \\"symptoms of serious mental aberration\\", and died in 1886. Benefit concerts were arranged for his family, but after it was discovered that he had accumulated savings of some ¬£3,000, a considerable sum at the time, the money raised was returned to the donors. He was buried at St Pancras Cemetery on 2 February 1886, where \\"a large number of residents of Camden Town\\" assembled in his honour.

The Middle East Journal 65.1 (2011): 73-84 Zoroastrian relations with Mumbai The need to review the rules and regulations of the Zoroastrians of India led them to seek help from their counterparts in Iran, and therefore sent a person named Behnam Nariman Houshang with various questions about the rules of the Zoroastrian religion to the priests of Sharifabad and Torkabad villages. This journey was not only the first field of knowledge of the Zoroastrians of Yazd about the Persians of India, but it caused the continuation of their relations until three hundred years later. The presence of the East India Company in India and the good relations of the Indian Persians with this company had provided them with trade conditions, so the Zoroastrians of Sharifabad and other Zoroastrian villages of Yazd established good trade relations with Mumbai and some emigrated there.

Early life  Ackers was born in 1914 in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, to Paul (a poor sharecropper) and Harriet (Williams) Markham. She had one brother, James Markham.  Career  She moved to the Detroit area with her brother in 1943 to work for a factory, as part of the Great Migration, then later to Ypsilanti, where she spent the rest of her life. In 1985, Ackers began to work in the Willow Run School District as a foster grandparent, through a program run by Child and Family Services.  Art  While working as a teacher's aide at Ford Elementary School in Ypsilanti, the school's art teacher, Christine Hennessy, introduced her to drawing and watercolor painting. Her drawings, such as Homestead and Yellow Interior, often reflected her memories of growing up in Arkansas. In 2002, the University of Michigan Museum of Art acquired five of her drawings. On her work, Ackers once said, \\"I imagine it and I start drawing.\\" She was represented by the Pardee Collection.

In 1978, as the World Health Organization (WHO) was shortly to announce that the world's last case of smallpox had occurred a year earlier in Somalia, Geddes diagnosed a British woman with the disease in Birmingham, England. She was found to be the index case of the outbreak and became the world's last reported fatality due to the disease, five years after he had gained experience on the frontline of the WHO's smallpox eradication programme in Bangladesh in 1973. His early research included work on drug discovery and antibiotics, and the definitions and management of bacterial meningitis and pneumococcal disease. In 1975, he became Chairman of the first editorial board of the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. In the same year he was co-editor of the best seller book titled Control of Hospital Infection, later known as Ayliffe's Control of Healthcare- Associated Infection: A Practical Handbook. Following the September 11 attacks, Geddes became an adviser on bioterrorism for the UK's Department of Health, his chief role being in the national smallpox plan and in biodefence training. In 2015, he retired from his position as Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, having served the journal for the previous 10 years. His recollections of smallpox in Birmingham inspired Mark Pallen to write The Last Days of Smallpox: Tragedy in Birmingham, published in 2018. Early life and education Alasdair Geddes was born in Fortrose, near Inverness, Scotland, in May 1934, to Angus and Isabella Geddes. His early education was at the Fortrose Academy, the local school. Edinburgh Medical School In 1957 he graduated in medicine from the University of Edinburgh, where his interest in antibiotics later originated. Medical career He completed his early medical posts at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh and then in Perth, following which he spent two years completing National Service in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and rose to the rank of captain. Subsequently, he gained experience in infectious diseases and general medicine first at Edinburgh and then as a medical registrar at Aberdeen and began research on antibiotics, with publications in the British Medical Journal and The Lancet. After a visit to the United States, he returned to Britain and took up a post as one of two consultants in infectious diseases at the East Birmingham (now Heartlands) Hospital in May 1967, at the same time as the local smallpox hospital, Witton Isolation Hospital, was deemed unnecessary and therefore demolished by fire. Geddes, at the time, settled in Solihull. He later recounted that when \\"I told my friends in Edinburgh that I was going to work in infectious diseases, they thought I was a bit stupid. They said you‚Äôre mad, infectious diseases are disappearing, we have antibiotics and vaccines, why don't you do something more interesting!\\" Bangladesh (1973) In 1973, the Department of Health assigned Geddes as a visiting fellow with the World Health Organization (WHO) smallpox eradication effort in Bangladesh, where he spent seven weeks under the leadership of Nick Ward, travelling through villages and gaining frontline experience in smallpox vaccination. He later recalled \\"I saw many cases of smallpox.\\" In October 1973, as a consequence of the oil crisis, he was called to return to England. In the same year, he was designated Birmingham‚Äôs smallpox consultant. The following year, in an article in the British Medical Journal, he described signs and symptoms of smallpox and wrote that > the possibility of smallpox should be considered in every patient with > unexplained fever who has recently visited the five countries of the world > where this disease is still endemic-namely, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, > Nepal and Ethiopia. The likelihood of smallpox re-appearing in countries > other than these five should always be remembered. Writing In 1975, Geddes became Chairman of the first editorial board of the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. In the same year, he co-edited the best-seller Control of Hospital Infection, later known as Ayliffe's Control of Healthcare-Associated Infection: A Practical Handbook. In 1976 L. P. Garrod stated in his review of the book that it made much \\"of how to cope with a suspected case of smallpox. As the WHO claims that this disease is on the verge of extinction, even in Bangladesh, may future editions safely omit this?\\" Throughout his career, Geddes authored almost 200 scientific publications covering a wide range of infectious disease topics. Antibiotics His early research included work on drug discovery and studies on the use of cephaloridine. Pertaining to trials of what became known as Augmentin, a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, he later recalled that ‚Äúgetting the right dose of amoxicillin proved important for efficacy and getting the right dose of clavulanic acid was key to tolerability‚Äù. In 1977, he published on the efficacies of cephamycins, including their parenteral administration, dosages and penetrations through normal and inflamed blood-brain barrier. He made comparisons of clindamycin with lincomycin against H. influenzae in vitro, and later demonstrated that clindamycin was active against Coxiella burnetti, the cause of Q fever. Other research has included studies on the antiviral aciclovir. Birmingham (1978) In August 1978, five years after returning from Bangladesh, Geddes diagnosed smallpox in Janet Parker, a medical photographer working in the East Wing of the medical school in Birmingham. She had been admitted to Ward 32 at East Birmingham Hospital after being diagnosed with at first chicken pox and then a drug reaction. Several physicians saw her before Geddes was called to the hospital for an opinion. Aware that Parker also worked in a room above the regional smallpox laboratory, he in turn called upon virologist Henry Bedson and both confirmed their suspicions that same day when they examined fluid from Parker's blisters and saw brick-shaped particles under the electron microscope, compatible with smallpox. Until this time, all the call-outs he received for suspected smallpox cases were false-alarms such as erythema multiforme and Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome. With the WHO about to announce the eradication of smallpox, it was widely thought that the last ever case of smallpox had occurred the previous year, in 1977 in Somalia. Parker later died on 11 September 1978 and became the last reported fatality due to the disease. Later, in an interview in 2004, when asked if Parker's case had any link with the 1966 smallpox outbreak in Birmingham, he replied \\"it is probably significant that the initial case in the variola minor outbreak in the west midlands in 1966 was, like Janet Parker, a photographer in the Birmingham Medical School, where research was being carried out on smallpox viruses.\\" 1980s He was appointed professor of infectious diseases at Birmingham University in 1982. In chapter seven of the Report of a committee of inquiry into the future development of the Public Health Function, chaired by the then Chief Medical Officer Sir Donald Acheson and presented to parliament in the wake of the 1984 outbreak of Salmonella in Wakefield and the 1985 outbreak of legionellosis at Stafford, Geddes was noted to head a subcommittee to deal with control of communicable disease and infection. 1990s In the 1990s, he was involved in tuberculosis (TB) research, leading the University of Birmingham team in the Glaxo Action tuberculosis programme that studied the molecular biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and new ways of delivering medicines into the TB infected cells. By studying how the human immune system responded to TB, Geddes hoped that the results would lead to a new vaccine, more effective than the BCG. In 1991 he became professor of infection at the University of Birmingham Medical School, where in 1994 he became its Deputy Dean then Associate Dean from 1999 to 2002. He has served as civilian consultant in infectious diseases and tropical medicine to the Royal Navy, Deputy Chairman of the Tropical Diseases Research Board of the UK Medical Research Council, and the Committee on Safety of Medicines and of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.

Paul-Ehrlich- > Institut, Langen (Germany), P. 16 With smallpox in the media again after 2001, and noting that Parker had previously received two smallpox vaccinations, he became interested in how long immunity lasts in those who have previously been immunised. It led him to study and publish in 2005 an article on the Edinburgh smallpox outbreak of 1942, where six of the 36 cases of smallpox had received previous vaccination. The following year he published \\"The history of smallpox\\". In 2015, after 10 years in the post, he retired from his position as Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents. Awards and honours Geddes is a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences. From 1996 to 1998 he was president of the International Society for Infectious Diseases. The following year, he received the Garrod Medal and delivered its accompanying lecture.Geddes, A. (2000) \\"Infection in the twenty-first century: predictions and postulates\\".

Vol. 46, pp. 873‚Äì877 In 2009, he received Honorary Membership of the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. He received the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases award for excellence in clinical microbiology and infectious diseases in 2014. Subsequently in 2015 he received the Hamao Umezawa Memorial Award (HUMA) Award.

Œ±,Œ≤-Unsaturated carbonyl compounds refers to organic compounds with the general structure (O=CR)‚àíCŒ±=CŒ≤-R. Examples would be enones and enals. In these compounds the carbonyl group is conjugated with an alkene (hence the adjective unsaturated). Unlike the case for carbonyls without a flanking alkene group, Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyl compounds are susceptible to attack by nucleophiles at the Œ≤ carbon. This pattern of reactivity is called vinylogous. Examples of unsaturated carbonyls are acrolein (propenal), mesityl oxide, acrylic acid, and maleic acid. Unsaturated carbonyls can be prepared in the laboratory in an aldol reaction and in the Perkin reaction. Classes File:MVK-2D-skeletal.pngMethyl vinyl ketone, the simplest Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketone File:Acrolein-skeletal.pngAcrolein, the simplest Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated aldehyde File:Methyl acrylate.pngMethyl acrylate, an Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ester File:Acrylamide-2D-skeletal.pngAcrylamide, precursor to polyacrylamide File:Maleins√§ure.svgMaleic acid, an Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated dicarbonyl File:Fumaric- acid-2D-skeletal.pngFumaric acid, isomeric with maleic acid File:Acryloyl chloride2.pngAcryloyl chloride Œ±,Œ≤-Unsaturated carbonyls can be subclassified according to the nature of the carbonyl group. Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated acids, esters, and amides An Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated acid is a type of an Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyl that consists of an alkene conjugated to a carboxylic acid. The simplest example is acrylic acid (CH2=CHCO2H). These compounds are prone to polymerization, giving rise to the large area of acrylate plastics. Acrylates are derived from but do not contain the acrylate group. Methyl acrylate and acrylamide are commercially important examples of Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated esters and Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated amides. They also polymerize readily. Acrylic acid, its esters, and its amide derivatives feature the acryloyl group, CH2=CHC(O)-. Œ±,Œ≤-Unsaturated dicarbonyls are also common. The parent compounds are maleic acid and the isomeric fumaric acid. Maleic acid forms esters, an imide, and an anhydride, i.e. diethyl maleate, maleimide, and maleic anhydride. Fumaric acid, as fumarate, is an intermediate in the Krebs citric acid cycle, which is of great importance in bioenergy. Enones An enone is a type of an Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyl that consists of an alkene conjugated to a ketone. The simplest enone is methyl vinyl ketone (butenone, CH2=CHCOCH3). Enones are typically produced using an aldol condensation or Knoevenagel condensation. Some commercially significant enones produced by condensations of acetone are mesityl oxide (dimer of acetone) and phorone and isophorone (trimers). General reaction for an aldol condensation between two carbonyl compounds. In the Meyer‚ÄìSchuster rearrangement, the starting compound is a propargyl alcohol. Cyclic enones can be prepared via the Pauson‚ÄìKhand reaction. Enals An enal is a type of an Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyl, consisting of an alkene conjugated to a aldehyde. The simplest enal is acrolein (CH2=CHCHO). Other examples include cis-3-hexenal (essence of mowed lawns) and cinnamaldehyde (essence of cinnamon). File:Crotonaldehyde.pngE-Crotonaldehyde, an enal that exists as isomers File:Cyclohexenone.pngCyclohexenone, common cyclic enone File:Testosteron.svgtestosterone, the male sex hormone File:Zimtaldehyd - cinnamaldehyde.svgCinnamaldehyde, essence of cinnamon File:P-Benzochinon.svgParaquinone, a particularly electrophilic Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyl File:(benzylideneacetone)iron- tricarbonyl-2D-skeletal.pngEnone complex of iron tricarbonyl File:Squaric acid.svgSquaric acid Reactions of Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyl Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyls are electrophilic at both the carbonyl carbon as well as the Œ≤-carbon. Depending on conditions, either site is attacked by nucleophiles. Additions to the alkene are called conjugate additions. One type of conjugate addition is the Michael addition, which is used commercially in the conversion of mesityl oxide into isophorone. Owing to their extended conjugation, Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyls are prone to polymerization. In terms of industrial scale, polymerization dominates the use of Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyls. Again because of their electrophilic character, the alkene portion of Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyls are good dienophiles in Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions. They can be further activated by Lewis acids, which bind to the carbonyl oxygen. Œ±,Œ≤-Unsaturated carbonyls are good ligands for low-valent metal complexes, examples being Fe(bda)(CO)3 and tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0). Œ±,Œ≤-Unsaturated carbonyls are readily hydrogenated. Hydrogenation can target the carbonyl or the alkene (conjugate reduction) selectively, or both functional groups. Enones undergo the Nazarov cyclization reaction and in the Rauhut‚ÄìCurrier reaction (dimerization). Safety Since Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated compounds are electrophiles and alkylating agents, many Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyl compounds are toxic. The endogenous scavenger compound glutathione naturally protects from toxic electrophiles in the body. Some drugs (amifostine, N-acetylcysteine) containing thiol groups may protect from such harmful alkylation.

History  The Accra Native confederation was influenced by the simultaneous, but considerably more successful projects of the Fanti Confederation in Gold Coast. The theories of James B. Africanus Horton called it the \\"Republic of Accra\\" projected. From the first meetings of the operators of the Fanti Confederation in the city of Mankessim. In 1868 due to the joint colonization by British and Dutch government with interest in gold and diamonds, representatives of the leading Fante and also represetatives of Denkyira, Wassa, Twifu, and Assin of Accra were present and proclaimed loyalty to the British with the right to the right to self-govern and keep the Dutch from assuming control of forts in the area. The new state had a King-President as its head and a council of kings and elders and national assembly representing the larger portion of the society; similar to the Native American socio-political structure before European colonization of the land currently known as the United States of American, The Accra Native Confederation was formed in 1869, but quickly failed due to lack of support by the local chiefs native to the land. As the European colonizers moved into the region an army of 15,000 men were utilized to impose poll taxes for the British who were know forcibly covering the region. The backlash of fighting for control between the British and the Dutch continued on through 1873, leaving the peaceful and diplomatic Natives with little autonomy and right to govern their own land and people. The people were inflicted with illnesses like small pox and dysentery which had never inflicted the health of their people until European invasion for the purpose of slave trading and colonization took place. The Accra (etymology: account) were no longer able to account for the needs of their people or their land due to the power structure of the Europeans that entered their land, and their way of life for the purpose of slave trading, colonization, acquisition of gold and diamonds, as well as to impose tax on the people in order to send money back to the royal crown in Britain. For decades to come their is a continuous power struggle between who the British viewed as the \\"educated elite\\" Natives (AKA: those that would not revolt given their new esteemed title) whose main objective was to act in favor of the British colonizers by maintain an element of contrived power while simultaneously giving allegiance and profit to the British crown. The power struggle mimics the Trump presidency in the United States in the sense that once someone was thought to be too powerful or not showing total allegiance and faith in the powers that be were quickly overturned for one reason or another. The uncertainly of the people and their way of life was in constant flux due to the nature of greed, desire to conqueror, and lack of knowledge and skill to run a nation using peaceful and diplomatic policies to run a government by the people and for the people. It is imperative that people look at the cycle of history and realize that once greed, colonization, unfair imposition of taxes, and desire for power takes place the entire political structure will always fall, it has been doing for thousands and thousands of years. The only way to rule a home or a government is to live among the people, like the people, and with the people; with nothing more than the best interests of all the people. Colonization has been the demise of democracy around the world. If there is one thing to learn from the Native Accra is that they are a mirror reflection of US politics in 2020. Unfortunately in 2020 we have Nuclear warheads, airplanes and drones dropping toxic chemical trails in neighborhoods across the US, and agreements among superpowers to partake in Insider Trading from March 1, 2019 - December 31, 2019 known as the Martha Underground Project. If that was bad enough we progressed in the drone execution of Quasem Solemani on January 3, 2020 but were uncertain if the man dead was Quasem Solemani or Hossein Salami for over a month. Step three unleash the pandemic in full force, world-wide. Too bad those working for various government agencies and fields of science such as Ornithology responsible for digging graves from the Spanish Flu are far to intellectually inferior to have any clue what they created with COVID-19. The US Dooms Day Book is worse than the Dooms Day book in the UK, but there are many of us roaming the quiet suburban neighborhoods and bustling busy cities of the US that know who is responsible for all that is unfolding now and those same people share ancestral lines with those that colonized nations of the past, that allowed and enjoyed slavery, and winked as they turned a blind eye to egregious murders, child prostitution rings and so much more. We are the US and we are currently 10,000 times worse than what took place on the Gold Coast almost a 150 years ago. Kill the people, kill the planet, or kill the planet kill the people; the cycles are overlap and quantum cryptology can easily prove that much over and over and over again!

Life  Born in Neu-Isenburg, K√∂hler, like his cousin, the tenor Franz V√∂lker, first completed an apprenticeship at Disconto-Bank in Frankfurt, where he subsequently worked as a bank clerk. Like Franz V√∂lker, he was a member of the Gesangverein Frohsinn - S√§ngerbund 1834 Neu-Isenburg and also had singing lessons with Alexander Wellig-Bertram, who had also trained the baritone Heinrich Schlusnus. Clemens Krauss engaged K√∂hler in 1928 as a lyrical baritone beginner at the Oper Frankfurt, where K√∂hler sang Silvio in Leoncavallo's Pagliacci'. After working at the Cologne Opera House under Eugen Szenkar, the Ulm City Theatre under Herbert von Karajan and Koblenz, he was engaged in 1937 by the Intendant and General Music Director Rudolf Krasselt at the Staatsoper Hannover as first lyrical baritone. He remained loyal to this house and was a guest performer until 1969. From 1947 on, he taught at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik, Theater und Medien Hannover until his death there in 1976 at the age of 72.  Career  K√∂hler had a pleasantly sonorous, lyrical baritone voice, which developed into a character baritone as he grew older. His talent and wit made him a paradigm actor of Rossini's The Barber of Seville, a role he has sung over 200 times and with which he has performed in Berlin, D√ºsseldorf, Hamburg and Cologne. He also sang Papageno in Mozart's The magic flute, and - with the exception of the hero baritone part - almost all baritone parts except Mozart's Don Giovanni and Count Almaviva in Le nozze di Figaro. These two roles, for which his stature seemed less suitable, he often managed to escape with success by cunningly recommending his Berlin colleagues Karl Schmitt-Walter at the Intendance as guests for Don Giovanni or the Count. In return, the latter was only too happy to let him have the Rossini-Figaro in Berlin. At the age of 70, he still sang Prince Ottokar in Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz. K√∂hler worked as a singing teacher at the University of Music and Theatre. He repeatedly refused to be awarded the title of \\"Professor\\". He had learned his working attitude from Herbert von Karajan. Core sentences taken over from him, such as \\"Can't do, doesn't exist! What you cannot do, you have to work for\\", or \\"What is the first duty of a teacher and leader? To make oneself superfluous!\\" - determined the progress of his teaching activities. He gave his students the tools to be independent singers, so that in case of problems they could always rely first on the basic rules of what they had learned. He taught beginners seven days a week, only to reduce the frequency of his lessons to the number of compulsory lessons in the course of time.Otto K√∂hler on Operissimo Seven singers with the title Kammers√§nger have been initiated or vocally coached by K√∂hler, the singers Joan Carroll, Ruth-Margret P√ºtz, Margarete Berg, Elisabeth Pack and Gerd NienstedtNiensted, Gerd, in Dirk B√∂ttcher ' (2002), Siegfried Haertel and Barr Peterson. The baritones Leonhard Delany, Tonio Larisch, Georg Schulz, Manfred Ball, Reinhard Braun and the tenors Horst Hoffmann as well as Joachim Siemann were also instructed in singing by him. Several later university professors received their vocal training from K√∂hler: Manfred Ball, G√ºnter Binge, Gerd Nienstedt, Friedrich- Wilhelm Tebbe and Michael Temme, and the concert and opera singers Christine Reil, Heike Henkel, Dieter Miserre and Ulf Kenklies. Most of K√∂hler's male pupils had come from the Knabenchor Hannover, whose male voices he supervised vocally. Among them was Gerry Schmidt, who later directed both the extra choir of the Staatsoper Hannover and its children's choir.

The most basic form of this instrument is a U-shaped glass tube filled with mercury. More complex versions deal with very high pressure or have better means of filling with mercury.  Description  The instrument consists of a glass U-tube half- filled with mercury. One end is connected to the vessel whose pressure is being measured. The other may be either left open or sealed. If it is left open, the pressure measured is relative to air pressure, which is variable. If it is sealed, the pressure measured is the absolute pressure. The tube is sealed during manufacture with the sealed end containing a vacuum.H√°la et al., pp. 207‚Äì209 Mercury is a useful material to use in a manometer because of its high density. This means that a much shorter column is needed compared to water.Stein, p. 409 For instance, the pressure represented by a column of of water is just under of mercury (mmHg).Herman, p. 82 The pressure is determined by measuring the difference in height between the reference column and the column connected to the item under test. Calibration marks are usually provided to aid in this measurement and in laboratories a cathetometer might be employed for accuracy.H√°la et al., p. 208 When relative pressure is being measured the difference may be negative, meaning the test pressure is below the reference pressure.Singh, p. 8 The ubiquity of this instrument led to mmHg becoming a common unit of measure of pressure. It is also related to another unit of pressure, the torr. The mmHg is not an SI unit but is still sometimes found in use, particularly in medicine.Lindh et al., p. 271 In SI units, is approximately .Kotz et al., p. 516  Filling with mercury  Zimmerli's mercury pressure gauge The initial filling of a sealed gauge with mercury can be problematic. One method involves fusing the glass of the gauge to a vessel of mercury, pumping out the air and boiling the mercury. After filling, the gauge is then cut away again. Further, the vacuum in the gauge eventually deteriorates due to slow diffusion of gases through the mercury, making the device inaccurate.H√°la et al., pp. 209‚Äì211 A gauge that overcame the filling problems was invented by Adolph Zimmerli (1886‚Äì1967), p. 34 in 1938, at least for low pressures (that is, pressures below ambient pressure ‚Äì partial vacuums).Zimmerli, p. 283 Zimmerli's gauge consists of three relatively wide columns. Referring to the diagram, the columns in the centre and on the right function as a standard U-tube gauge. Additionally, the top of the centre column is connected to the bottom of the third column on the left with a capillary tube. The centre column is initially completely filled with mercury, as is the connecting capillary. The other two columns are partially filled. The top of both the main column on the right and the reservoir column on the left are connected together and to an inlet for the pressure to be measured. When the test pressure is applied, the mercury rises in both the left and right columns and falls in the centre column. The mercury at the top of the capillary breaks and a vacuum forms there. The pressure is then measured in the usual way by the difference between the heights of the right and centre columns.H√°la et al., pp. 211‚Äì212 Since a new vacuum is formed each time a measurement is made, there is no problem with the vacuum becoming contaminated. Any bubbles that do form in the capillary are easily removed by inverting the gauge and shaking or tapping.H√°la et al., p. 212  High pressure measurement  Kamerlingh Onnes mercury pressure gauge For extremely high pressures, the column can still be very high, even when using mercury. Gauges for measuring pressure in the range have been built.H√°la et al., p. 220 A 23-metre-tall mercury column is difficult to read and suffers from inaccuracies caused by different parts of the column being at different temperatures. A more compact mercury pressure gauge suitable for high pressure was built by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, the discoverer of superconductivity. This consisted of a series of mercury filled U-tubes connected together with inverted U-tubes. The inverted U-tubes contain compressed air at a pressure designed to bring the instrument into the pressure range of interest. The pressure is found from this instrument by summing together the difference in column heights in each of the U-tubes.H√°la et al., p. 220  History  The parent of all mercury pressure gauges is the mercury barometer invented by Evangelista Torricelli in 1643.Mack, p. 3-12 An early engineering application of the mercury pressure gauge was to measure pressure in steam boilers during the age of steam. The first use on steam engines was by James Watt while developing the Watt steam engine between 1763 and 1775. This engine was a development of the popular Newcomen atmospheric engine.Kopp, p. 494 A gauge for use on steam engines very similar to the later Kamerlingh-Onnes gauge was patented in 1858 by Thomas Purssglove. Like the Kamerlingh-Onnes device, it had multiple U-tubes connected in series. The connecting tubes were filled with an incompressible fluid.Purssglove, p. 1 The instrument was formerly widely used in education, laboratories, and medical measurements as well as its industrial applications. However, the toxicity of mercury and the risk of spills, through broken glassware, has led to its decline. It is also easier to interface other types of sensor to electronic systems. By 1991 it had mostly been replaced by other technologies.COWI, pp. 138‚Äì139  Use as a standard  Mercury gauges are commonly used as the primary standard for pressure by national measurement standards laboratories.Suski et al., p. 75 For instance, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the US uses a gauge that is three metres tall and contains of mercury. For precision, ultrasonics are used to measure the mercury column height. However, in 2019 the backup gauge was decommissioned after being out of service for years. It was so large that it could not be removed by normal means; a hole was cut in the ceiling to extract it. The decommissioning was part of an international move to stop using mercury in standards laboratories for environmental reasons. NIST will eventually also take the main mercury gauge out of service after a portable photonic device is installed to replace it.Lee  See also  * McLeod gauge, a type of mercury pressure gauge used for calibrating electronic pressure gauges  References  Bibliography  * COWI Consulting Engineers and Planners, Mercury: A Global Pollutant Requiring Global Initiatives, Nordic Council of Ministers, 2002 . * H√°la, Eduard; Pick, Ji≈ô√≠; Fried, Vojtƒõch; Vil√≠m, O.; Standart, George (trans), Vapour‚ÄìLiquid Equilibrium, Pergamon Press, 1967 (Elsevier reprint, 2013 ). * Herman, Irving, Physics of the Human Body, Springer Science & Business Media, 2007 . * Kopp, Brian, \\"Industrial telemetry\\", ch. 18 in, Telemetry Systems Engineering, Artech House, 2002 . * Kotz, John C.; Treichel, Paul M.; Townsend, John R., Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity, vol. 1, Cengage Learning, 2008 . * Lechevalier, Hubert A., \\"The Waksman Institute of Microbiology, 1954 to 1984\\", The Journal of the Rutgers University, vol. 49‚Äì51, pp. 20‚Äì45, Associated Friends of the Library of Rutgers University, 1987. * Lee, Jennifer Lauren, \\"No longer under pressure: NIST dismantles giant mercury manometer\\", NIST, 28 June 2019/15 January 2020, retrieved and archived 29 August 2020. * Lindh, Wilburta Q.; Pooler, Marilyn S.; Tamparo, Carol D.; Dahl, Barbara M., Delmar's Clinical Medical Assisting, Cengage Learning, 2009 . * Mack, Donald M., Instrumentman 1 & C, United States Government Priniting Office, 1990 (1973 edition ). * Purssglove, Thomas Paramore, \\"Pressure gauge\\", English Patents of Inventions, Specifications: 1858, 2675-2752, patent no. 2739, filed 1 December 1858, issued 31 May 1859. * Singh, Sarbjit, Experiments in Fluid Mechanics, PHI Learning, 2012 . * Stein, Benjamin, Building Technology: Mechanical and Electrical Systems, John Wiley & Sons, 1996 . * Suski, J.; Puers, R.; Ehrlich, C.D.; Schmidt, J.W.; Abramson, E.H.; Sutton, C.M., \\"Pressure\\", ch. 3 in, Goodwin, A.R.H.; Marsh, K.N.; Wakeham, W.A.

It works by sampling an ensemble of molecular conformations (nuclear geometries) in the source state, computing the transition probabilities to the target states for each of these geometries, and performing a sum over all these transitions convoluted with shape function. The result is an incoherent spectrum containing absolute band shapes through inhomogeneous broadening. NEA simulates the spectrum in three steps: firstly an ensemble of molecular geometries is generated. 2)Secondly the transition probability between the initial and final states is computed for each geometry. Lastly a sum over all transition probabilities is done convoluted with a shape function.  Motivation  Spectrum simulation is one of the most fundamental tasks in quantum chemistry. It allows comparing the theoretical results to experimental measurements. There are many theoretical methods for simulating spectra. Some are simple approximations (like stick spectra); others are high-level, accurate approximations (like those based on Fourier-transform of wavepacket propagations). The NEA lies in between. On the one hand, it is intuitive and straightforward to apply, providing much improved results compared to the stick spectrum. On the other hand, it does not recover all spectral effects and delivers a limited spectral resolution.  Historical  The NEA is a multidimensional extension of the reflection principle, an approach often used for estimating spectra in photodissociative systems. With popularization molecular mechanics, ensembles of geometries started to be also used to estimate the spectra through incoherent sums. Thus, different from the reflection principle, which is usually done via direct integration of analytical functions, the NEA is a numerical approach. In 2012, a formal account of NEA showed that it corresponded to an approximation to the time-dependent spectrum simulation approach, employing a Monte Carlo integration of the wavepacket overlap time evolution.  NEA for absorption spectrum  Consider an ensemble of molecules absorbing radiation in the UV/vis. Initially, all molecules are in the ground electronic state Because of the molecular zero-point energy and temperature, the molecular geometry has a distribution around the equilibrium geometry. From a classical point of view, supposing that the photon absorption is an instantaneous process, each time a molecule is excited, it des from a different geometry. As a consequence, the transition energy has not always the same value, but is a function of the nuclear coordinates. The NEA captures this effect by creating an ensemble of geometries reflecting the zero-point energy, the temperature, or both. In the NEA, the absorption spectrum (or absorption cross section) œÉ(E) at excitation energy E is calculated as \\\\sigma \\\\left( E \\\\right)=\\\\frac{\\\\pi {{e}^{2}}\\\\hbar }{2mc{{\\\\epsilon }_{0}}E}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{n}^{\\\\frac{1}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i}^{\\\\Delta {{E}_{0n}}\\\\left( {{\\\\mathbf{x}}_{i}} \\\\right){{f}_{0n}}\\\\left( {{\\\\mathbf{x}}_{i}} \\\\right)g\\\\left( E-\\\\Delta {{E}_{0n}}\\\\left( {{\\\\mathbf{x}}_{i}} \\\\right),\\\\delta \\\\right)}}, where e and m are the electron charge and mass, c is the speed of light, Œµ0 the vacuum permittivity, and —õ the reduced Planck constant. The sums run over Nfs excited states and Np nuclear geometries xi. For each of such geometries in the ensemble, transition energies ŒîE0n(xi) and oscillator strengths f0n(xi) between the ground (0) and the excited (n) states are computed. Each transition in the ensemble is convoluted with a normalized line shape function centered at ŒîE0n(xi) and with width Œ¥. Each xi is a vector collecting the cartesian components of the geometries of each atom. The line shape function may be, for instance, a normalized Gaussian function given by g\\\\left( E-\\\\Delta {{E}_{0n}},\\\\delta \\\\right)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi {{\\\\left( \\\\delta /2 \\\\right)}^{2}}}}\\\\exp \\\\left( -\\\\frac{{{\\\\left( E-\\\\Delta {{E}_{0n}} \\\\right)}^{2}}}{2{{\\\\left( \\\\delta /2 \\\\right)}^{2}}} \\\\right). Although Œ¥ is an arbitrary parameter, it must be much narrower than the band width, not to interfere in its description. As the average value of band widths is around 0.3 eV, it is a good practice to adopt Œ¥ ‚â§ 0.05 eV. The geometries xi can be generated by any method able to describe the ground state distribution. Two of the most employed are dynamics and Wigner distribution nuclear normal modes. Molar extinction coefficient Œµ can be obtained from absorption cross section through \\\\sigma = \\\\ln(10) \\\\frac{10^3}{N_\\\\text{A}} \\\\varepsilon \\\\approx 3.823 532 16 \\\\times 10^{-21}\\\\,\\\\varepsilon. Because of the dependence of f0n on xi, NEA is a post-Condon approximation, and it can predict dark vibronic bands.  NEA for emission spectrum  In the case of fluorescence, the differential emission rate is given by \\\\Gamma(E) = \\\\frac{ e^{2}}{2\\\\pi \\\\hbar mc^3 \\\\epsilon_{0}} \\\\frac{1}{N_{p}} \\\\sum_{i}^{N_{p}} \\\\Delta E_{1,0}(\\\\mathbf{x}_{i})^2 \\\\left  f_{1,0}(\\\\mathbf{x}_{i})\\\\right  g\\\\left(E-\\\\Delta E_{1,0}(\\\\mathbf{x}_{i}), \\\\delta\\\\right). This expression assumes the validity of the Kasha's rule, with emission from the first excited state.  NEA for other types of spectrum  NEA can be used for many types of steady-state and time-resolved spectrum simulations. Some examples beyond absorption and emission spectra are: * two-dimensional * differential transmission * photoelectron * ultrafast Auger * X-ray photo-scattering  Limitations of NEA  By construction, NEA does not include information about the target (final) states. For this reason, any spectral information that depends on these states cannot be described in the framework of NEA. For example, vibronically resolved peaks in the absorption spectrum will not appear in the simulations, only the band envelope around them, because these peaks depend on the wavefunction overlap between the ground and excited state. NEA can be, however, coupled to excited-state dynamics to recover these effects. NEA may be too computationally expensive for large molecules. The spectrum simulation requires the calculation of transition probabilities for hundreds of different nuclear geometries, which may become prohibitive due to the high computational costs. Machine learning methods coupled to NEA have been proposed to reduce these costs.

The film is taunted to be the first full fledged lesbian film in the history of Nollywood. However some sources stated that it is also the first Nigerian LGBT film. The film revolves around the lives of a same sex women couple who also face challenges by being lesbians in Nigeria. With the release of the official trailer of the film on YouTube in July 2020, the film is expected to be released via internet possibly at the end of the year. The film raised concerns and publicity among Nigerians for the film genre coupled with the trailer reception.  Cast  * Cindy Amadi * Uzoamaka Aniunoh  Production  It was revealed that the script was penned as a romantic story between two females and the project was initiated jointly by Uyai Ikpe-Etim and Pamela Adie in collaboration with the Equality Hub, an NGO which operates in Nigeria focusing on LGBT rights. The film was set to break the stereotypes faced by the Nollywood industry which historically failed to live up to the expectations of portraying the LGBTQ elements.  Censorship  The film dealt with censorship issues during its production phase due to its genre related to LGBTQ. the film production and principal photography was not meant to be smooth for the filmmakers due to the interference of National Film and Video Censors Board which threatened and refused to approve the film for the theatrical distribution. Prior to the release of the official trailer in July 2020, it was noted that the film was not submitted by the filmmakers to the NFVCB. The theatrical interpretation of LGBT in Nigeria is regarded to be controversial. The same sex relationship is considered as a serious offense in Nigeria and a punishment of 14 years imprisonment is imposed if found guilty. The Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act of 2014 was passed by former President Goodluck Jonathan which terms same sex marriages and LGBT as illegal. Adedayo Thomas, the executive director of NFVCB in an interview with CNN insisted that the Board would not approve films which promote themes and portrayal of elements that do not conform with Nigeria's values, beliefs, morals, traditions and constitution. The NFVCB also issued warnings and threats stating that it would track the LGBT filmmakers in Nollywood following the production of Ife.  Release  Though the film wasn't banned officially by the NFVCB, the film is scheduled to be released via online platforms instead of a theatrical release as to avoid the censorship issues and due to the uncertainties due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. The filmmaker Adie revealed that the film will not be streamed via YouTube and revealed that the film would be streamed through their own platforms.

Arnold c. 1915 at Arlington Harold DeForest Arnold (September 3, 1883 ‚Äì July 10, 1933) was an electronics engineer and pioneer of radio communication and telephony. He served as the first director of research at Bell Telephone Laboratories from 1925 to his death.  Life and work  Arnold was born in Woodstock, Connecticut to Calvin Arnold and Audra Allen. He studied at Wesleyan University for his BS and MS and then studied physics at the University of Chicago for his PhD. He initially studied under Albert A. Michelson but when he confided to Robert Andrews Millikan that he would probably have to commit suicide as he could not meet Michelson's requirement, Millikan took Arnold over as his own student.Karl Darrow interviewed by Henry Barton and W. J. King. 1964 When Frank B. Jewett was looking for someone to work on repeaters for transcontinental telephony, Arnold was suggested by Millikan. Arnold worked at the University of Chicago from 1907 to 1909 and served as a professor at Mount Allison University, from 1909-1910 and then at University of Chicago (1910). In 1911 he joined the Western Electric Company under Edwin H. Colpitts. His earliest work was in the development of a vacuum- tube based amplifiers beginning with improvements to Lee De Forest's triode ‚Äúaudion‚Äù. He worked on innovations that made it possible to demonstrate the first radio transmission between Arlington, Virginia, and Paris, France, in October 1915. During World War I he served as a captain in the signal corps. He developed and refined manufacturing techniques for vacuum tubes, oxide coatings for filaments, and other innovations for reliability and ease of replacement. Permalloy and Perminvar were developed by his team and this helped improve signal quality in undersea cables. Arnold received the John Scott Medal in 1928. One of his last projects was in the transmission of high quality sound, with the collaboration of Leopold Stokowski, conductor at the Philadelphia Orchestra that resulted in a live broadcast of a concert at Constitution Hall over telephone in April 1933. He died from a heart attack at his home in Summit, New Jersey. Arnold married Leila Berman in 1908 and they had two daughters.

Erected in 1926, it was one of the first large-scale statues of Lenin, being completed within three years of his death. It depicts the man making a speech from atop an armoured car, soon after his 1917 arrival at the station from exile abroad. It was designed in an early constructivist style by sculptor Sergei A. Evseev and architects Vladimir Shchuko and Vladimir Helfreich. The style and pose of the statue were imitated by later works. The statue is one of few in Saint Petersburg that survived after the fall of the Soviet Union. It was damaged in a 2009 bomb attack but has since been repaired.  Lenin at Finland Station  A depiction of Lenin speaking from atop an armoured car that inspired the statue Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin had been living in exile in Switzerland during the First World War. After the February Revolution he was permitted by the German authorities to travel via sealed train across German territory, take a ferry to Helsinki and thence a train to Petrograd, as Saint Petersburg was then known. Arriving at the city's Finland Station he was met by a crowd of Bolshevik sympathisers and climbed onto the turret of an armoured car. He rode the car to the Bolshevik headquarters at the Kshesinskaya Palace and delivered a speech in favour of Bolshevism and denouncing the moderate Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionary Party. After the Russian Civil War, Lenin led the communist Soviet Union, but died of a stroke on 21 January 1924.  Statue  Detail of statue, with station behind The statue, erected in 1926, is one of the first largescale statues of Lenin erected in the Soviet Union, though it is predated by one in Volgograd. The statue depicts Lenin in the act of making a speech from atop the armoured car. The statue was created in an early constructivist style by sculptor Sergei A. Evseev and architects Vladimir Shchuko and V.G. Gelfreich. The figure is made of bronze while the plinth, representing the armoured car, is of stone. The statue depicts Lenin in a suit and tie with waistcoat and overcoat, clothing associated with his later position as leader of the Soviet Union, rather than his 1917 attire as a revolutionary leader. As with other depictions of Lenin from this period he is depicted bareheaded (his hat is shown tucked into the right-hand pocket of the overcoat). Lenin is depicted with his right arm raised to shoulder height, palm forwards and thumb upraised. This \\"taxi-hailing\\" pose is common to many Lenin statues, though Berkeley Professor Laura Bonnell states that this depiction differs from later versions in that Lenin's arm is used to indicate a directional movement, rather than offering a benediction to the masses. The statue's left hand holds the lapels of Lenin's overcoat and suit jacket. The monument is described by Oxford Professor Penelope Curtis as the \\"first important monument\\" of Lenin and establishing a style that has been much repeated by later statues. Joseph Brodsky thought the statue the first ever to depict a person on top of an armoured car and compared it to the tradition of equestrian statues of previous leaders.  History  The statue was unveiled on 7 November 1926. It originally stood in a small square in front of the station, it was moved to a new position when the square was remodelled after the Second World War and a new, larger Lenin Square was created. It faces across the square toward the River Neva and the Bolshoy Dom, formerly the headquarters of the KGB in the city and now used by the Federal Security Service. By 1979 every station in Leningrad (Petrograd had been renamed again five days after Lenin's death) had a statue or bust of Lenin. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 the majority of these were torn down; the Finland Station statue is one of the few that remain and is one of the most famous in the country. At 4.30am on 1 April 2009 the statue was attacked by a bomb. A hole measuring was blown in the buttocks of the statue. The attackers were never caught. The statue was taken away for repair and reinstalled in April 2010.

It was not part of the 399 or 407 district sets, but is recognized in the 422 district set as a temporary district. It was split from Khanabad District in late 2015 after a visit from Ashraf Ghani, the president of Afghanistan. The district is mostly under Taliban control, with only a few government-held areas. In 2019, only two polling centers were open in the district, with 277 votes cast.  Geography  Aqtash is bordered by Dasht-e-Archi District to the north, Baharak District and Bangi District to the east, Khanabad District to the south, and Kunduz District to the west. Kunduz District holds the provincial capital of Kunduz, and Baharak and Bangi are located in Takhar Province. The Khanabad River forms Aqtash's southern border.  History  Aqtash District was established in 2015 by Ashraf Ghani after he visited Kunduz Province. Gurtipa District and Calbad District were also created. A large operation was conducted to clear the district of militants in 2016, with dozens of villages cleared. In the 2018 election, only two polling centers were open in Aqtash, and the district governor declined to provide further details other than \\"turnout was good\\". Earlier that year, an operation was taken to clear the district and succeeded. However, as soon as security forces left, the Taliban returned to the district. An operation was launched in 2017, causing 50 militant casualties. Later, in June 2019, a bastion was stormed in the district and 19 detainees were set free. A large operation was taken by the government in early 2020, killing many insurgents and their commanders across Kunduz Province, including Aqtash. Over 10,000 people were displaced as a result of the fighting in Aqtash, or about 1472 families.

Since 1930, he published scholarly papers, especially on the history of the organ and on matters of musical tuning.  Life  Born in Saalfeld, Kreis Mohrungen, Kelletat experienced his early childhood in Graudenz (West Prussia) and in Liebstadt (East Prussia). Later the family lived in Bromberg (1917-1921) and in Halle (1921-1930). Kelletat began studying German, English and musicology at Friedrichs-University Halle in 1926. Although his parents moved to Marienburg (West Prussia), he initially stayed in Halle and later changed to study at the Albertus-Universit√§t K√∂nigsberg. There, from 1930 to 1934, he extended his studies of musicology with Joseph M√ºller-Blattau and organ playing with Adolf Wieber. On the occasion of a trip to the Baltic States in 1932 he met Monika Hunnius in Riga. Kelletat received his doctorate in 1933 with the dissertation Zur Geschichte der deutschen Orgelmusik in der Fr√ºhklassikZur Geschichte der deutschen Orgelmusik in der Fr√ºhklassik on WorldCat and became assistant to M√ºller-Blattau. From 1934 on, Kelletat continued his studies (organ playing and improvisation) at the Kirchenmusikschule in Berlin-Spandau with Gerhard Schwarz, Herbert Schulze and Ernst Pepping. In the same year, he married Margarete Nominikat. Kelletat also wrote music reviews for the Preu√üische Zeitung. He continued his organ studies with Karl Matthaei in Winterthur. From 1935 to 1944, he worked for almost ten years as cantor and organist at the Altst√§dtische Kirche. In 1944, he completed his habilitation with Walther Vetter on the history of the organ in East and West Prussia and was awarded the title of professor. In 1946, he founded the Rostock Academy of Music, but fled to West Berlin in the same year and began teaching at the Academy of Music. From 1948 to 1951, Kelletat was cantor and organist in Soest and founded the Evangelische Studentenkantorei Deutschlands in 1948. For over 20 years, from 1951 to 1972, Kelletat was then organist and cantor of the church at Hohenzollernplatz in Wilmersdorf. During this time, he was the state church music director for Berlin from 1952 and founded the Berliner Kantorei in 1953. In 1980, after the death of his wife Margarete, he moved to Bad Salzuflen and married Hedwig B√ºlow. In 2002, Kelletat moved to Flensburg to the Gotthard-und-Anna-Hansen-Stift of the DIAKO (Diakonische Anstalten).

Included are Thomas A. Dorsey, considered the \\"Father of Gospel Music\\", and \\"Mother\\" Willie Mae Ford Smith, an associate of Dorsey's who trained gospel singers for decades. Ford and three singing acts ‚Äì Delois Barrett Campbell and the Barrett Sisters, Zella Jackson Price, and the O'Neal Twins, Edgar and Edward, backed by a choir ‚Äì provide music throughout. After its debut at the New York Film Festival to a sold out audience, Say Amen, Somebody saw a limited release in major cities. It received widespread critical acclaim with reviewers focusing especially on the strong personalities within gospel and the joyful music. It was restored in 2019 and was shown at limited theaters, again receiving positive reviews. Summary Say Amen, Somebody gives an overview of the history of gospel music in the U.S. by following two main figures: Thomas A. Dorsey, considered the \\"Father of Gospel Music\\" and 83 at the time of filming, recalls how he came to write his most famous song, \\"Take My Hand, Precious Lord\\" (1932), and the difficulty he faced introducing gospel blues to black churches in the early 1930s. \\"Mother\\" Willie Mae Ford Smith, 77 years old and an associate of Dorsey's, is the film's primary subject. Smith was closely involved with the organization Dorsey co-founded, the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses (NCGCC), becoming the director of the Soloists' Bureau in 1939. In this position, she trained several very influential 20th century gospel singers though remained relatively unknown herself outside of gospel. Delois Barrett Campbell, and Zella Jackson Price are shown confronting the sacrifices they have made to put gospel music in the fore of their lives and the lives of their families, and the O'Neal Twins, Edward and Edgar, discuss the difficulties in trying to make a living exclusively in gospel music. The film features informal moments of subjects singing in private places, such as Dorsey in his back yard and Smith at her kitchen table, and two music recitals, one at an NCGCC meeting in Houston (1981), and a tribute concert for Willie Mae Ford Smith in St. Louis that Neirenberg organized. Development As a 28-year-old Jewish filmmaker, George Neirenberg had no experience with gospel music before taking on the project. He had recently finished No Maps On My Taps (1979), a documentary following three New York City-based tap dancers. Seeking ideas for a new project, he asked blues guitarist and friend Ry Cooder for suggestions: \\"These were his exact words ‚Äì he said, 'You oughta look into gospel music; those cats are really neat.' \\"Movshovitz, Howie, \\"'Say Amen, Somebody' Restoration Unveils The Wonder Of The Gospel Pioneers National Public Radio, (February 25, 2020).

Greg, \\"Say Amen Somebody\\", American Cinematographer, (March 1984), Vol. 65, No. 3, p. 38. He decided on the project when he learned no documentary about gospel music had ever been made. He believed this, and his inexperience with the topic, allowed him to bring a \\"fresh point of view\\" to the film, saying, \\"One of my goals was to dispel the mystique of the gospel experience, which people have all kinds of misconceptions about... or don't know what to think of.\\"Sterritt, David. \\"This Romp Through Gospel Music Is a G-Rated Joy\\", The Christian Science Monitor, (April 7, 1983). For background work, Neirenberg interviewed hundreds of figures in gospel music, including James Cleveland, the Hawkins Family ‚Äì also known as the Edwin Hawkins Singers who released the international number 1 hit, \\"Oh Happy Day\\" in 1969, Rebert Harris of the Soul Stirrers, and Claude Jeter, an original member of the Swan Silvertones.Say Amen, Somebody American Film Institute website. Retrieved August 2020. After learning about Dorsey, Smith, and their contributions to gospel music, Neirenberg settled on them as the central focus of the film, later admitting that had he not found them, the film probably would not have been made. They were, in his opinion, extraordinary people whose stories should be told. He met with them, then visited Smith in her St. Louis home and Campbell in hers. With the background research done, Neirenberg felt that half of his pre- production work was behind him. To put all the participants at ease during filming, he spent a year in churches, becoming familiar with choirs and singers, music, and church culture.\\"The Making of Say Amen, Somebody, Now Gloriously Restored\\" Speakers' panel sponsored by Film at Lincoln Center, video hosted on YouTube (2019).

The title of the film references typical moments in black churches when a preacher will say a phrase or scripture, and met without any response ‚Äì especially if the congregation does not agree ‚Äì will prompt them by saying, \\"Say 'Amen', somebody.\\" Dorsey does this in the film when he remembers that gospel blues, denigrated in black churches before 1932 for being sinful and degrading, is in actuality the \\"good news\\" of Christ's salvation, eliciting support and agreement from his audience. Production and filming Neirenberg does not use a narrator in the film to explain details to the audience. Instead, stories are told through memories shared on camera, vintage film footage and still shots, and more intimate scenes Neirenberg set up between performances. He employs a personalized method of documentary filmmaking, using subjects the way a scripted movie uses characters. Contrary to a purist view of making documentaries where the filmmaker only observes without interfering with the subject, explaining that \\"it's my role to find the story\\", Neirenberg prompted scenes to play out between the subjects and during editing did his best not to misrepresent the people and the situations they were in. All the cinematographers had to do was film. For example, a scene where Delois Barrett Campbell and her husband are having a discussion in their kitchen about her touring Europe with her sisters was instigated by Neirenberg, who already knew this was a point of contention between them. Campbell and her sisters formed a gospel trio in 1963. Touring Europe with them had been a dream of Delois' for many years. Her husband, Reverend Frank Campbell, says that he wishes she would be more involved in his ministry and not go. She looks at the camera, then asks him if he wanted eggs with his sausage without any further response. Though the exchange was real, when Neirenberg arrived for filming that day, the Campbells had already eaten. He asked Delois to make breakfast again and while she did, he leaned towards Frank's ear and prompted him to ask Delois a question. Neirenberg did not know the moment would be so tense. When Delois looks at the camera, she is actually looking at Neirenberg, behind the camera, in consternation. Conversely, the scene in which Smith's grandson tells her that he thinks women should not be ministers was a complete surprise to everyone, including Smith, who was ordained in the 1940s. During filming, Neirenberg recalls a litany of mechanical problems with cameras, lighting, and sound equipment, remembering it as \\"a disaster\\". Much of the time dedicated to technical aspects of filming was spent setting up lighting, which, according to J. Greg Evans in American Cinematographer, acts as support for the narrative structure of the film. Whenever possible, natural lighting was used, but when more was needed, what the cinematographers added was as close to natural light as possible. While this took some time to accomplish ‚Äì for instance, setting the lights for the performances at the NCGCC meeting took three days ‚Äì it helped to enhance the realism in the film and put the subjects at ease. Evans writes that because of the lighting, the cinematographers were able to capture \\"some of the most brilliant colors ever in a documentary\\". Neirenberg furthermore insisted that each of the three cameras had a sound man and an assistant during musical performances to capture ambient sounds and conversations so nothing would be missed. While filming the performers, Neirenberg sat above the crew, directing each camera assistant to capture what he wanted. He also made sure the film had 24-track sound, so each singer can be heard clearly with the supporting shouts and calls from the audience. In addition to organizing the tribute concert for Willie Mae Ford Smith, which he did purposefully to bring all the subjects together to watch them interact as they perform, Neirenberg picked each singing act's repertoire. Each musical number was rehearsed with the performers, camera, and sound crews before filming. With so many lights on the performers, Neirenberg wanted to make sure the shadows of all the crew members would not appear in the final edit so they would not detract from the performances. Because he organized so far in advance, filming for Say Amen, Somebody took only 15 days, something Evans considers \\"quite remarkable for a film of this nature and magnitude\\". Looking back, cinematographer Don Lenzer viewed the filming sessions as a unique experience in his career. Going into the project, he was unsure Neirenberg's strategy of setting up scenes would bring results that would be both realistic and interesting to watch. He remarked that capturing the performances was as powerful as they are to see on film, bringing about an ecstasy of being \\"in the moment\\". For Lenzer, the joyous outcomes \\"defy explanation\\", and he recalled that \\"everything about the filming was extraordinary\\". Dorsey began to show signs of Alzheimer's disease in the late 1970s. His involvement in the film was limited to periods when he was able to participate. His attendance at the NCGCC conference in the film was his last. He stopped speaking almost entirely two years after filming, and died in 1993. Willie Mae Ford Smith died the next year.\\"Dedication: Thomas Dorsey Dedication Day\\", Atlanta Journal and Constitution (June 26, 1994).

Restoration In 2019, Neirenberg supervised the restoration of the film, an effort funded by the Center for African American Media Arts, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Academy Film Archive, the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, Milestone Films, and the Robert F. Smith Fund.Siler, Brenda C. \\"'Say Amen, Somebody' Explains Gospel Music\\", The Washington Informer, (May 29, 2019). Retrieved August 2020. Rhea Combs of the Smithsonian commented that Neirenberg understood \\"the dynamics at play [in gospel music and churches] and he has a sensitivity to the story and the people ‚Äì truly to the people ‚Äì and respects them. And I think that that respect is then reflected in the way in which the film is produced and directed.\\" She also remarked that much of the film's value lies in \\"passing the torch\\" from the older generation of singers to the new. Originally, Say Amen, Somebody was filmed in standard 4:3 aspect ratio. When restored, the aspect ratio became 16:9, making the visuals cleaner and brighter, and easier to see on televisions. The audio was also enhanced to Dolby surround sound 5.1.Pollard, Deborah Smith. \\"Media Reviews\\", Journal of the Society for American Music, (2020), Volume 14, Number 2, pp. 244‚Äì246.

Neirenberg told National Public Radio that the restoration looked \\"like a new film completely\\", and he is especially proud that \\"it will carry forward gospel music and allow people for generations to experience this music.\\" He furthermore stated that he continues to receive comments from black Americans who have seen the film multiple times, and he is taken aback when they express how much it means to them. At the time of the film's release, he was unaware of its significance, and had no idea of its \\"true meaning\\".  Music  The soundtrack was initially issued as a double LP album containing twenty tracks, five of which were cut from the film. It was sold at theaters during original showings in 1982 and 1983. A second fifteen-track album was released in 1990. Reception Say Amen, Somebody earned widespread critical acclaim both in 1982 and following its restoration in 2019. Reviewers foremost expressed appreciation for the music, and they noted the repeated themes in the film: sexism within gospel, the passing of traditions from the older generation to the younger, and the sacrifices musicians must make forsaking commercial success for devotion to God.

He states, \\"The film is shrewd in its selection of these moments. There are just enough of them to ground in a recognizable reality what could have been merely a well-shot and -edited compilation of irresistible music. But they are never so many that they interfere with the film's soaring flights of song.\\" In the New York Times, Janet Maslin, like all other critics, praised the music specifically, calling it \\"joyful, communal, and deeply moving\\".Maslin, Janet, \\"Say Amen, Somebody\\", The New York Times, (October 5, 1982), Section C, p. 9.

He calls it the \\"brightest, funniest, most joyful ‚Äì and certainly the most inspirational film you're likely to come across in a long time... if you can resist it it's time to get your pulse checked.\\" He observes that Willie Mae Ford Smith does not sing for appearances; she sings because she believes.

B1. In the Los Angeles Times, Sheila Benson calls it \\"joyful right down to your shoestrings\\" and \\"absolutely infectious\\". Regarding Thomas Dorsey's frailty, George Neirenberg \\"succeeds in involving us so completely that the question of whether Dorsey can summon the will to make it to the gospel convention, in which he has participated since 1933, becomes a true cliffhanger and Dorsey's appearance has the meaning for us that it has for the convention members.

Elena (middle) is seen getting ready for the wedding with some fellow females. Filmed at Club Dignitas in Bucharest, the story takes action in Southern Italy. The video starts with Elena, playing the bride, and the groom getting ready in their respective rooms with their helpers and friends. Elena peeks out her door to see the Italian guy, played by George Pistereanu, sitting on a chair outside her door. She takes a moment before heading out the door and engaging in a flirty commotion, where he chases her while she acts coy. She goes up to her groom and straightens his jacket, before heading outside with him to get married. The narrative continues with the dinner and the party fully get on the way. The Italian guy continues to chase her, but her mother is always watching or stepping in. During Glance's bit of the song, the groom and the groomsmen can be seen having a party in the room they were previously getting ready in. One of the bridesmaids can be seen dancing sexily over Glance, before turning her attention to the groom. Elena sees all this and puts a stop to it. The party continues until near the end where Elena sees her groom and the bridesmaid behind a tree, ending their embrace and her dress is unzipped at the back; he withdraws his hand from under the back of her dress. At the very end, Elena is sitting on some stairsteps changing her shoes, where the Italiano guy wraps his jacket around her before leaving with his mates.

It was established in 2003 by the World Health Organization (WHO), which had previously set up the independent Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS), prompted by concern from public health officials regarding the dissemination of potentially harmful health information via the web. By appraising websites, using credibility and content criteria defined by GACVS, the VSN has been developed to deliver information that is easy to access and up-to-date. As of 2020, the initiative has 89 member sites in 40 countries and 35 languages. Prior to inclusion in the list, each website is assessed for its credibility, accessibility, content and design. A peer-reviewed study of 26 websites listed by VSN in 2008 noted \\"the transparency of financing, the lack of links to the pharmaceutical industry, the transparency of site management and responsibility and the proven scientific quality and constant updating of contents\\" of its assessed resources. Purpose The purpose of the VSN is to evaluate the variable reliability of on-line vaccine related information and address concerns caused by websites which circulate partially complete or misleading content, including speculative rumours or falsified research, which may consequently damage vaccination programmes. It aims to regularly review the vaccine related content disseminated on-line by different health-related organizations around the world, thereby validating them by including them on their list as websites that observe \\"good information practices\\". History and membership In developed countries, more than 90% of young people use the internet regularly, running the potential for misinformation on immunisation reaching a large proportion of society. This has also been challenging in low and middle income countries. In 1999, concern from public health officials regarding the dissemination of potentially harmful health information via the web led the WHO to establish the 'Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety' (GACVS), the purpose of which is to deliver an assembly of independent professionals that can advise both the public and those involved in national vaccine policy, after assessing evidence pertaining to vaccine safety concerns that require a quick and impactful response. In 2003, the WHO created the VSN, devised to \\"help counteract misinformation about vaccines\\" and deliver easily accessible information to up-to-date accurate evidence, by appraising websites that provide material on vaccination. The credibility and content criteria are defined by GACVS. As a result, the reliability and standards set by WHO's GACVS and available at VSN has been created to help people judge the quality of the website information they read. In the year of its creation, the VSN approved 23 websites as members in languages including English, French, Dutch, Italian, German and Spanish. In March 2009, the VSN listed a total of 29 websites that had been approved as containing \\"sound and credible\\" vaccine safety information. As of 2020 the initiative has 89 member sites in 40 countries and 35 languages. Recommendations of good practice for vaccine websites are published by the WHO's GACVS. Some member sites refer to their inclusion in the VSN list as a kind of quality certification. Members Websites are included to the VSN list following evaluation of their credibility, accessibility, content and design. As listed on the official website, members include: *American Academy of Pediatrics *Centers for Disease Control and Prevention *National Foundation for Infectious Diseases *NHS Inform *Ministry of Health (Argentina) *Paul-Ehrlich-Institut *Public Health Agency of Canada *Public Health Agency of Sweden *Regional Assembly of Murcia *Vaccine Knowledge Project *Vaccine Confidence Project Evaluation In 2008 a peer-reviewed study of 26 websites included in the VSN list by April 2007 noted \\"the transparency of financing, the lack of links to the pharmaceutical industry, the transparency of site management and responsibility and the proven scientific quality and constant updating of contents\\" of its assessed resources, unlike websites critical of vaccination. 84.6% of sites recorded contact details, 73.1% noted which data protection procedure they used and that the data would not be sold or forwarded to third parties. Most sites used English.

Rumors about the manner of the man‚Äôs death set off a new round of protests, rioting, and looting in Minneapolis, which came as the city was still dealing with the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed African American man, by a white Minneapolis police officer three months prior. The homicide suspect, the 38-year-old Eddie Sole Jr. of Minneapolis, died of a gunshot wound to the head outside a downtown Target store. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner‚Äôs Office later listed his manner of death as a suicide, which was confirmed by surveillance footage. Background The root of the unrest was the suicide of a homicide suspect in downtown Minneapolis on August 26, 2020. The homicide was the 52nd of the year in the city. Many residents were still on edge from the killing of George Floyd the previous May, when police had mischaracterized Floyd‚Äôs death as due to \\"medical distress\\" in early statements about the incident. Protesters reacting to news of a new shooting death, that video later showed was a suicide, did not trust initial police accounts of the incident. Posts on social media websites suggested that Minneapolis police were responsible for the man's death. The unrest also came as part of the larger Black Lives Matter movement and protests against police brutality in 2020. Late at night on August 15 in Minneapolis, a group of approximately 50 people marched to the city's fifth police precinct station in what was initially described as a peaceful protest, but it became violent when people threw rocks at windows, threw paint on the building, and shot commercial-grade fireworks at police officers, before fleeing the scene.Staff (16 August 2020). \\"Minneapolis Police: Group vandalized MPD precinct building, shot fireworks at officers\\". FOX-9. Retrieved on 16 August 2020. The August 23 shooting of Jacob Blake, an African American man, in Kenosha, Wisconsin by a police officer, led to protests and unrest that spilled into Minnesota. On August 24 in Minneapolis, a 100-person protest over Blake's shooting took place in the city's downtown area, and after the main protest group disbanded, some protesters broke windows and threatened to breach a jail facility, resulting in 11 arrests.Walsh, Paul (August 25, 2020). \\"11 protesting Kenosha police shooting arrested after jail damaged in Minneapolis\\" . Star Tribune. Retrieved on August 25, 2020. One Minneapolis police officer suffered a broken hand during a confrontation with a demonstrator. In Minneapolis by August, the downtown workforce was at 85 percent of prior capacity, with many business closed and people working from home due to concerns about COVID-19, and with fewer people on the street there were concerns about the perceptions of crime and lack of police presence. Events=August 26 AT&T; store damaged by vandalism, August 26-27, 2020 Eddie George Gordon, a 61-year-old from Rush City, Minnesota, died from multiple gunshot wounds while inside a parking ramp near 10th Street North and Currie Avenue West at 2 p.m. on Wednesday, August 26 in downtown Minneapolis. Police sources believed he had been in an altercation with a man and woman, who both fled the scene on foot. Police apprehended the woman suspect, but the male suspect fled. A 6 p.m. the police had tracked him down on Nicollet Avenue and closed in for an arrest. The male suspect was later identified as Eddie Sole Jr., a 38-year-old from Minneapolis. As police forces advanced to make an arrest, Sole Jr. shot himself in the head while standing on a sidewalk outside the entrance to a Target store, just before officers reached him. Within an hour of the shooting a large crowd had gathered at the scene. The encounter between Sole Jr. and the police quickly sparked social media rumors about the manner of his death. At a Black Entrepreneur State Fair event on the other side of the Mississippi River in Father Hennepin Bluff Park, nearly away from where the death occurred, a DJ announced to the crowd that police were covering up a death with a suicide story. A group marched across the Stone Arch Bridge to downtown to protest what they believed was a police shooting. That evening protesters swelled into the city's downtown area and reached what was estimated as a crowd of 500 people. Police denied that they had fired weapons at Sole Jr. during pursuit and released a surveillance video of his apparent suicide to quell rumors that it was another officer involved shooting.Levenson, Michael (August 26, 2020). \\"Minneapolis Homicide Suspect‚Äôs Suicide Spurs More Protests, Police Say\\". New York Times. Retrieved on August 27, 2020. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo also sent text messages to several racial justice advocates seeking help in circulating the video, such as to Nekima Levy Armstrong who attempted to contain the spread of false information. However, some in the crowd downtown began breaking windows at nearby businesses, resulting in property destruction and looting at many stores and restaurants.Hyatt, Kim, Simons, Abby Walsh, Paul (August 27, 2020). \\"Curfew expires, daylight exposes rioting's scars in downtown Minneapolis\\". Star Tribune. August 27, 2020. As the scene downtown became more violent some in the crowd urged others stop the destruction, including a person on a megaphone who shouted, \\"We have the video ‚Äî the man killed himself!\\" At 9:30 p.m. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey publicly requested assistance from the Minnesota National Guard to restore order. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz activated troops just before 11:00 a.m. and the first troops arrived downtown just before midnight. Frey imposed a citywide curfew overnight, and both Walz and Frey declared a state of emergency. Destruction overnight reached a total of 72 property locations in Minneapolis and four locations in neighboring Saint Paul. In Minneapolis, four businesses were set on fire, including a downtown restaurant and three other businesses located miles away from the city's downtown area. The rioting in downtown Minneapolis mostly stretched along Nicollet Mall from 5th to 12th streets, though it spread to a gas station and liquor store near Loring Park. The rioting also an effect beyond downtown Minneapolis. Businesses in south Minneapolis, Uptown, and Dinkytown were vandalized and looted. Two Minneapolis police officers were seriously injured during the unrest and hospitalized, but the injuries were not believed to be life threatening. One of the injuries, captured on a bystander‚Äôs video, showed an officer being hit in the head by a trash can lid. August 27 To prevent further rioting and looting, officials put in place a curfew for the second night, from the hours of 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. the following day. Nearly 1,000 members of law enforcement and 400 Minnesota National Guard troops amassed in the metro area to prevent more lawlessness. Thirty people were arrested that night, all for curfew violations. Calmness prevailed after August 27. August 28‚Äì30 State and local officials declined to issue a curfew for Friday, August 28. However, Minneapolis city officials extended the state of emergency through the weekend to allow for possible curfews, if needed to address unrest. National Guard troops and law enforcement were kept mobilized. Aftermath=Government response to the unrest Officials believed that their experience with the unrest in the days after the killing of George Floyd the previous May led to a speedier response that distinguished people protesting peacefully and those causing destruction. Homicide investigation The investigation into the homicide of Eddie George Gordon revealed that he had been in an altercation with Eddie Sole Jr. and an unnamed woman around 2 p.m. on August 26, 2020 in the Ramp A parking garage in downtown Minneapolis. Sole Jr. pulled out a gun and shot Gordon in the head. By August 31, police sources were not sure what provoked the incident. Both men had connections to the Salvation Army's Harbor Light Center shelter next door to the parking garage, with Gordon making occasional night stays since 2017 and Sole Jr. calling it his home for the past two-and-a-half years. It was also unclear to investigators why Sole Jr. shot himself as officers closed in. Rioting arrests and criminal charges State and local officials arrested a total of 132 people during the unrest that featured looting, reports of shots fired, thrown bottles at police, and the firing commercial grade fireworks. Authorities charged 27 people, just 19 percent of those arrested, for crimes such as assault and burglary related to the rioting and looting from August 26 into August 27. Those charged ranged in age from 18 to 50, with home addresses in Minneapolis, Saint Paul, suburban cities, and as far away as Saint Cloud, Minnesota. A 28-year-old man from Minneapolis faced charges in early September for burglary and assaulting a police officer by throwing a 15 pound metal garbage can lid and knocking him unconscious on August 26. Federal authorities charged a 24-year old man from Richfield, Minnesota for breaking into the downtown headquarters of the Target Corporation and setting a fire in the mailroom. According to U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald‚Äôs office, Target surveillance video captured the man's activities in the building around 10:55 p.m. on August 26 and street surveillance video captured the man and another person leaving the scene in his vehicle. The fire damage was said to be minor. The accused person was initially arrested by Richfield police at 12:49 a.m. on August 27 for an unrelated traffic stop, but he was found in procession of clothing items with price tags. The man also faced local criminal charges from the Hennepin County Attorney‚Äôs Office for receiving stolen property. Economic impact At the time of the unrest, downtown Minneapolis businesses were said to be struggling from closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic and unrest after the killing of George Floyd the previous May. For the dozens of business that were broken into and looted, the August riot was considered another challenging economic setback. The four business set on fire on August 26 included Brits Pub on the Nicollet Mall in downtown, and three businesses in south Minneapolis, a Tires Plus store, a Walgreens drug store, and the China Wok restaurant. The south Minneapolis area was the epicenter of heavy rioting after Floyd‚Äôs death in late May, including where a police station was torched. Kam Talebi, owner of the downtown Brits Pub, remarked about broader conversations to address the unrest in Minneapolis, \\"I hope within that there's a priority of safety for residents and the businesses. It's just tough to be able to operate right now in downtown Minneapolis.\\" Some commentators speculated that the unrest and rioting in Minneapolis in 2020 could mark a decades-long period of stagnation and decline, similar to what cities such as Los Angeles, Detroit, and Newark experienced after historic unrest. Suicide video controversy As protesters gathered in downtown Minneapolis the evening of August 26, the Minneapolis Police Department sent out a message via the Twitter website that contained an embedded video: \\"*WARNING: This video contains graphic images. This evening, a murder suspect committed suicide as police approached them at 8th & Nicollet. No officer weapons were fired. This is a tragedy for our community that is still hurting.\\" Release of the video generated controversy though allowable under a set special circumstances in Minnesota state law. Some Minneapolis officials believed that quick release of the video was necessary to stop rumors of a police shooting. City officials had to weigh pain of people seeing the graphic content with their intention of stopping rioting and looting. Minneapolis police and many media outlets took down postings of the video later the same evening.

It is an expanded re- imagining of the Ludum Dare game jam submission Lonk's Greedy Adventure, also by Pixelatto. In the game, players are sent on a quest to rescue a princess from the Dark Lord in an open world environment. Depending on the actions taken by the player, any of 100 endings can occur. The game is a humorous parody of role-playing video games, particularly of the The Legend of Zelda series. Reventure was released to critical acclaim and was praised for its humor.  Gameplay and plot  Reventure is a 2D action-adventure platformer, mainly inspired by the The Legend of Zelda series. From the beginning of the game, players are given their quest to save the princess from the Dark Lord, who is keeping her captive in his castle. Throughout the game's open world are many items which allow the player character to perform new abilities as well as alternate objectives aside from rescuing the princess. Depending on how the player interacts with the world, any of 100 different endings can occur, which are marked in a gallery in the player's menu. Each ending takes place in a short cutscene, after which the player is taken back to the beginning of the game with a short text sequence connecting the ending to the beginning of the next playthrough. In this sense, all playthroughs of the game are canonical, and take place chronologically in whatever order the player choses to go through them. As the player completes different endings, the world of the game, as well as the player character, can change. For example, after rescuing the princess, a permanent shortcut is unlocked to the Dark Castle; after dying in a pit of spikes, following the ending the player character will be visibly bloodied and covered in spikes; these changes can even include the player character being completely replaced. The end goal of the game is to unlock every ending, as well as complete a post-100 endings sequence and find several secrets in order to get the game to its full 125% completion. The game also features integration with Twitch, allowing viewers to interact with the game. In 2020, Pixelatto released a free-to-play version of the game on Android which starts the player with 3 lives, giving them an additional one every hour, with the option to skip the wait by watching an ad.  Development and release  Reventure was originally developed for the Ludum Dare game jam of 2017, at which point it was titled Lonk's Greedy Adventure (in reference to Link from The Legend of Zelda). This version of the game was entirely different from the full release, featuring only six endings and taking place in an almost entirely different world. Lonk's Greedy Adventure scored third among all the entries of the jam, spurring on Pixelatto founder Javi Cepa to develop the concept into a larger game. After six months of development an early access version of the game titled Lonk's Adventure featuring 50 endings was made available to the public in October 2018. The name was later changed to Reventure to avoid a brand conflict.  Reception  Reventure received critical acclaim, aggregating a score of 83/100 on Metacritic. Daniel Weissenberger of Game Critics called it \\"a masterpiece of design.\\" Critics gave particularly strong praise to the game's sense of humor.

It draws heavily on the work of J.A. Rogers. Mary Lefkowitz, Professor Emerita of Classical Studies at Wellesley College, traces the origins of the Black Cleopatra claim to the 1972 book by J.A. Rogers called \\"World's Great Men of Color.\\"World's Great Men of Color, Volume I, By J.A. Rogers; Simon and Schuster, 2011; Lefkowitz refutes Rogers' hypothesis, on various scholarly grounds. The black Cleopatra claim was further revived in an essay by afrocentrist John Henrik Clarke, chair of African history at Hunter College, entitled \\"African Warrior Queens.\\" Lefkowitz notes the essay includes the claim that Cleopatra described herself as black in the New Testament's Book of Acts ‚Äì when in fact Cleopatra had died more than sixty years before the death of Jesus Christ. Scholars identify Cleopatra as having been essentially of Greek ancestry with some Persian and Syrian ancestry, based on the fact that her Macedonian Greek family (the Ptolemaic dynasty) had intermingled with the Seleucid aristocracy of the time.Tyldesley, pp. 30, 235‚Äì236. Michael Grant states that Cleopatra probably had not a drop of Egyptian blood and that she \\"would have described herself as Greek.\\" Duane W. Roller notes that \\"there is absolutely no evidence\\" that Cleopatra was racially black African as claimed by what he dismisses as generally not \\"credible scholarly sources.\\" Cleopatra's official coinage (which she would have approved) and the three portrait busts of her considered authentic by scholars (which match her coins) portray Cleopatra as a Greek woman in style. Polo writes that Cleopatra's coinage present her image with certainty and asserts that the sculpted portrait of the \\"Berlin Cleopatra\\" head is confirmed as having a similar profile. In 2009, a BBC documentary speculated that Cleopatra might have been part North African. This was based largely on the examination of a headless skeleton of a female child in a 20 BCE tomb in Ephesus (modern Turkey), together with the old notes and photographs of the now-missing skull. The remains were hypothesized to be those of Arsinoe IV, half-sister to Cleopatra, and conjecture based on discredited processes suggested that the remains belonged to a girl whose \\"race\\" may have been \\"North African\\". This claim is rejected by scholars, based on the remains being impossible to identify as Arsinoe, the race of the remains being impossible to identify at all, the fact that the remains belonged to a child much younger than Arsinoe when she died, and the fact that Arsinoe and Cleopatra shared the same father Ptolemy XII Auletes but had different mothers.The Lives of Cleopatra and Octavia, By Sarah Fielding, Christopher D.

Rogers called \\"World's Great Men of Color.\\"World's Great Men of Color, Volume I, By J.A. Rogers; Simon and Schuster, 2011; Lefkowitz refutes Rogers' hypothesis. She notes Rogers's inability to correctly number Cleopatra's family (for example, naming Cleopatra's brother Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator as her father, who was actually Ptolemy XII Auletes, and naming Ptolemy XI Alexander II as Ptolemy XII's father when he was in fact Ptolemy IX Soter), using as his main sources a misinterpretation of William Shakespeare's \\"Antony and Cleopatra\\" (written over 1,500 years after Cleopatra's death) and falsely citing Encyclopedia Britannica (when in fact it did not then or ever claim Cleopatra was black), and that his presumption Cleopatra's paternal grandmother was a black African slave is \\"based in the more recent past.\\" She further stresses slavery in ancient times was very different from modern black chattel slavery, as slaves were not taken based on skin color but were in actuality mostly war captives, largely including Greeks, and notes Roger's claim of a black grandmother is based on practices by slave owners of the 19th century. The black Cleopatra claim, Lefkowitz continues, was further revived in an essay written by afrocentrist John Henrik Clarke, chair of African history at Hunter College, entitled \\"African Warrior Queens\\" for \\"Black Women in Antiquity.\\" She notes the essay was largely drawn on the writings of Rogers with Clarke's added \\"supporting information of his own\\" that includes his claim Cleopatra described herself as black in the New Testament's Book of Acts ‚Äì when in fact Cleopatra had died more than sixty years before the death of Jesus. She also notes that if Cleopatra's paternal grandmother was Egyptian and that is how she learned Egyptian, it would be more likely for Cleopatra's father Ptolemy XII to be the first Ptolemy to learn Egyptian instead of Cleopatra (noting those like Rogers and Clarke never mention him), who is the only member of the Ptolemaic dynasty known to have learned Egyptian in addition to her native tongue Koine Greek and eight other languages. In response to the book Not Out of Africa by Lefkowitz, Molefi Kete Asante, Professor of African American Studies at Temple University wrote the article \\"Race in Antiquity: Truly Out of Africa\\", in which he emphasized that he \\"can say without a doubt that Afrocentrists do not spend time arguing that either Socrates or Cleopatra were black.\\"  Known depictions  Coin portrait tetradrachm of and approved by Cleopatra VII Philopator, the last ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom Cleopatra's official Ptolemaic coinage (which she would have approved) and the three Roman portrait busts of her considered authentic by scholars (which match her coins) portray Cleopatra as a Greek woman in style, including the Greek chiton, Hellenistic diadem, and Greek chignon. Francisco Pina Polo writes that Cleopatra's coinage present her image with certainty and asserts that the sculpted portrait of the \\"Berlin Cleopatra\\" head from the Altes Museum is confirmed as having a similar profile with her hair pulled back into a bun, a diadem, and a hooked nose. Ernle Bradford writes that it is \\"reasonable to infer\\" Cleopatra had dark hair and \\"pale olive skin\\" by how she portrays herself as a \\"Eastern Mediterranean type\\" on her official coins, and that she challenged Rome not as an Egyptian woman, \\"but as a civilized Greek.\\" Similar to the Berlin Cleopatra, other Roman sculpted portraits of Cleopatra include diadem-wearing marble heads now located in the Vatican Museums and Archaeological Museum of Cherchell, although the latter may instead be a depiction of her daughter Cleopatra Selene II. The diademed 'Esquiline Venus' statue in the Capitoline Museums is also speculated as being an additional depiction of the queen, especially due to her connection with the Greek goddess Aphrodite as seen on some of her coinage. The Portland Vase, a Roman cameo glass vase dated to the reign of Augustus and now in the British Museum, includes a possible depiction of Cleopatra with a serpent rising in her lap as she sits and grasps the arm of her Roman spouse Mark Antony. In addition to sculptures and coins, several surviving Roman frescoes from Pompeii and Herculaneum also likely depict Cleopatra. A contemporaneous depiction from Pompeii's House of Marcus Fabius Rufus depicts the queen as the goddess Venus Genetrix holding a cupid in her arms, ostensibly a rare depiction of her son Caesarion who was fathered by the Roman dictator Julius Caesar. Susan Walker notes that the woman's ivory-white skin, round face, long aquiline nose, and large round eyes were features common in Roman and Ptolemaic depictions of goddesses. Duane W. Roller writes about the fresco: \\"there seems little doubt that this is a depiction of Cleopatra and Caesarion before the doors of the Temple of Venus in the Forum Julium and, as such, it becomes the only extant contemporary painting of the queen.\\" Walker, Roller and Joann Fletcher observe the similarity of this Pompeiian painting with the face preserved in the \\"Vatican Cleopatra\\", the damage on the left cheek of the sculpture possibly from the arm of a cupid that may have been torn off. Posthumous portraits include a fresco of Pompeii's House of Giuseppe II depicting her possible suicide by poisoning, a painted portrait in Pompeii's House of the Orchard showing a side view of her diademed bust, and a highly similar fresco from nearby Herculaneum, the latter which matches the visage of her sculptures and official coinage. Aside from Hellenistic art, native Egyptian artworks of Cleopatra include the Bust of Cleopatra in the Royal Ontario Museum, as well as stone-carved reliefs of the Temple of Hathor in the Dendera Temple complex in Egypt depicting Cleopatra and Caesarion as ruling pharaohs providing offerings to Egyptian deities. Other works include a large Ptolemaic black basalt statue now in the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, depicting an uncertain Ptolemaic queen thought to be either Arsinoe II or the famous Cleopatra VII. In his (2006), contends that this Egyptian basalt statue is like other idealized Egyptian portraits of the queen, and does not contain realistic facial features and hence adds little to the knowledge of Cleopatra's appearance. Diana Preston comes to a similar conclusion about native Egyptian depictions of Cleopatra: \\"Apart from certain temple carvings, which are anyway in a highly stylised pharaonic style and give little clue to Cleopatra's real appearance, the only certain representations of Cleopatra are those on coins. The marble head in the Vatican is one of three sculptures generally, though not universally, accepted by scholars to be depictions of Cleopatra.\\"  Ancestry  Scholars generally identify Cleopatra as essentially of Greek ancestry with some Persian and Syrian ancestry, based on the fact that her Macedonian Greek family (the Ptolemaic dynasty) had intermingled with the Seleucid aristocracy of the time (notably including the first Cleopatra, Queen Cleopatra I Syra, wife of Ptolemy V Epiphanes). While her mother's identity is uncertain, she is generally believed to be Cleopatra V of Egypt, the sister or cousin wife of Ptolemy XII Auletes, who was the daughter of Ptolemy IX Soter or Ptolemy X Alexander I.Tyldesley, pp. 30, 235‚Äì236. Additionally, while the identity of her paternal grandmother is not certain, she is generally believed to be Cleopatra IV, via Ptolemy XII's father, Ptolemy IX Soter,Bennett, Christopher J. (1997). \\"Cleopatra V Tryph√¶na and the Genealogy of the Later Ptolemies\\". Ancient Society. Peeters Publishers. 28. p. 52, 65. ISSN 0066-1619. or a Greek Alexandrian woman.Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames & Hudson. 2004. Ernle Bradford, Classic Biography: Cleopatra (Toronto: The Penguin Groups, 2000), p. 28. Claims of illegitimacy were never used against Cleopatra in the extremely hostile propaganda campaign by Augustus, Michael Grant noting that if Cleopatra had been illegitimate, her \\"numerous Roman enemies would have revealed this to the world.\\" Grant states that Cleopatra probably had not a drop of Egyptian blood and that she \\"would have described herself as Greek.\\" Grant also proposes that Cleopatra's paternal grandmother may have been mixed Syrian and Greek, in line with the precedent of Persian and Syrian blood in the Ptolemaic line, and continues that \\"certainly she was not an Egyptian,\\" noting there is only one known Egyptian mistress of a Ptolemy (from the 3rd century BCE). Lefkowitz writes that this Egyptian woman, named Didyame, was the mistress of Ptolemy II Philadelphus. She notes that among Ptolemy II‚Äôs many mistresses, Didyame was specifically signaled out because she was Egyptian, and not of the usual Greek stock among Ptolemaic mistresses (who included among Ptolemy II's mistresses, the courtesans Bilistiche, Agathocleia, Stratonice of Libya, and Myrto‚Äîwhose coloring and ethnicity were not specifically pointed out like Didyame, ‚Äúpresumably because they were Greek‚Äù). She further notes that if she had any children by Ptolemy, they never became king (all Ptolemaic kings were regarded as fully legitimate save for Ptolemy XII Auletes). She contends that it is \\"misleading to suggest that the unique non-Greek mistress Didyame provides evidence of a common practice.‚Äù. and no known Egyptian wife of a Ptolemaic king. speculates that Cleopatra VII could have been the daughter of a hypothetical half-Macedonian-Greek, half-Egyptian woman belonging to the priestly family of Ptah (the other main candidate he notes would be Cleopatra V/VI) located in Memphis in northern Egypt, but contends that whatever Cleopatra's ancestry, she valued her Greek Ptolemaic heritage the most. further notes that \\"there is absolutely no evidence\\" that Cleopatra was racially black African as claimed by what he dismisses as generally not \\"credible scholarly sources.\\" He goes onto say outside the hypothesis of Cleopatra being three-quarters Macedonian Greek and a quarter Egyptian, there is \\"no room for anything else, certainly not for any black African blood.\\" Diana Preston also writes that Cleopatra's paternal grandmother may have been part Syrian, continuing that even if Cleopatra had an Egyptian grandmother \\"it does not follow she was a black African\\" and that Cleopatra \\"almost certainly had olive skin and dark eyes.\\" Adrian Goldsworthy notes Cleopatra, having Macedonian blood with a little Syrian, was probably not dark skinned (he also notes Roman propaganda never mentions it), contending \\"fairer skin is marginally more likely considering her ancestry,\\" and that she \\"was no more Egyptian culturally or ethnically than most residents of modern day Arizona are Apaches.\\" He further notes that Cleopatra's native tongue was Greek, that it was in \\"Greek literature and culture she that was educated,\\" that her worship of Isis was \\"strongly Hellenised,\\" and that although she was presented in some statuary in the idealized Egyptian style, she was unlikely to have dressed like this outside of performing certain rites. Instead, he continues, Cleopatra \\"wore the headband and robes of a Greek monarch.\\" Stacy Schiff concurs Cleopatra was not dark-skinned, that \\"the Ptolemies were in fact Macedonian Greek, which makes Cleopatra approximately as Egyptian as Elizabeth Taylor\\", that her Ptolemaic relatives were described as \\"honey skinned\\", that she was part Persian, and that \\"an Egyptian mistress is a rarity among the Ptolemies.\\" Mary Lefkowitz notes that had Cleopatra's grandmother or mother been Egyptian, it surely would have been pointed out in the records, and concludes that whatever her ancestry, Cleopatra \\"regarded herself as Greek.\\" Schiff continues that Cleopatra \\"faithfully held up the family tradition.\\" In essence, Cleopatra's loyalties were to her Ptolemaic Greek heritage. As noted by Donald R. Dudley, Cleopatra and her family were \\"the successor[s] to the native Pharaohs, exploiting through a highly organized bureaucracy the great natural resources of the Nile Valley.\\"  Arsinoe IV In 2009, a BBC documentary speculated that Arsinoe IV of Egypt, the half-sister of Cleopatra VII, may have been part North African and then further speculated that Cleopatra's mother, thus Cleopatra herself, might also have been part North African. This was based largely on the claims of Hilke Th√ºr of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, who in the 1990s had examined a headless skeleton of a female child in a 20 BCE tomb in Ephesus (modern Turkey), together with the old notes and photographs of the now-missing skull. She hypothesized the body as that of Arsinoe. Arsinoe and Cleopatra, shared the same father (Ptolemy XII Auletes) but had different mothers,The Lives of Cleopatra and Octavia, By Sarah Fielding, Christopher D. Johnson, p. 154, Bucknell University Press, with Th√ºr claiming the alleged African ancestry came from the skeleton's mother. However, researchers Clarence C. Gravlee, H. Russell Bernard, and William R. Leonard, and others have demonstrated that skull measurements are not a reliable indicator of raceClarence C. Gravlee, H. Russell Bernard, and William R. Leonard. \\"Heredity, Environment, and Cranial Form: A Re-Analysis of Boas‚Äôs Immigrant Data\\" American Anthropologist 105[1]:123‚Äì136, 2003. and the measurements were jotted down in 1920 before modern forensic science took hold. To date it has never been definitively proved the skeleton is that of Arsinoe IV. Furthermore, craniometry as used by Th√ºr to determine race is based in scientific racism that is now generally considered a pseudoscience that supported \\"exploitation of groups of people\\" to \\"perpetuate racial oppression\\" and \\"distorted future views of the biological basis of race.\\" When a DNA test that attempted to determine the identity of the child, it was impossible to get an accurate reading since the bones had been handled too many times, and the skull had been lost in Germany during World War II. Mary Beard wrote a dissenting essay criticizing the findings, pointing out that one, there is no surviving name on the tomb and that the claim the tomb is alleged to invoke the shape of the Pharos Lighthouse \\"doesn't add up\\"; second, the skull doesn't survive intact and the age of the skeleton is too young to be that of Arsinoe's (the bones said to be that of a 15‚Äì18-year-old child, with Arsinoe being around her mid twenties at her death); and thirdly, since Cleopatra and Arsinoe were not known to have the same mother, \\"the ethnic argument goes largely out of the window.\\" See also * Afrocentrism * Ancient Egyptian race controversy * Biological anthropology * Cleopatra * Demographics of Egypt * Egyptomania * Ptolemaic dynasty * Ptolemaic Kingdom ReferencesSources * *Kathryn A.

Having emerged from the youth choir as a group singer, Medagedara has been able to show his talents and sang several popular songs such as Sandai Tharui, Asa Imu Api, Issara Bedi Pema, Obage Dothin Pidu and Mathu Muthu Wasse.  Personal life  Medagedara was born on 8 November in Theripehe village, Walapane in Nuwara Eliya as the youngest child of a rural family. His father Medagedara Vidyaratne was a farmer. His mother Rankiri was a housewife who helped father for agriculture. Somasiri has five elder brothers. He completed education from Theripehe Siddhartha Vidyalaya. He learned music in the school under the teacher M.M.K Tissa. He is good at reciting Pel Kavi and Virindu songs in the village. He was married to longtime partner Neela Seneviratne. She met Medagedara in 1984 while working as an Assistant Youth Service Officer at the Maharagama Youth Center after leaving the Bellwood Aesthetic Resort. The couple has two sons ‚Äì Yasas and Sahan Dhanushka; and one daughter, Yashoda Rasanjali. Illness In August 2019, the initial symptoms began to subside. At first he went for a doctor because it was difficult to defecate. There was also a tour of America during this time. Before that he went to the United States for medical treatment. After successfully conducting about 9 shows there, he returned to Sri Lanka and appeared for the medical examination. There he knew that a small lump in his stomach had turned into cancer. He stayed in the Apeksha hospital and underwent surgery. After few more days after surgery he went home and got sick again. The body temperature began to rise. Tests carried out there revealed that there was a disease in the liver which was because of the medication taken for the lumps in the intestines. In 2020, he has been receiving residential treatment at the Maharagama Apeksha Hospital since January 13. In August 2020, false rumors in the internet stated that he died due to cancer. Later, Medagedara himself made a comment on his false news. Career In 1980, he joined with the youth choir which was first established by the National Youth Services Council on September 01. Medagedara learned music under the music teachers Premadasa Mudunkotuwa and Sisira Kumara Marasinghe.

Early life and education  He was born in Daqing, China in 1966, and grew up in Hubei. He studied at the Sichuan Academy of Art. He moved to Beijing in 1993. On his background, he said, \\"I think there are many regional distinctions that I have incorporated into my art. For example, being born in Heilongjiang Province, I remember a lot of Soviet tanks going around when I was three. At that time, China had a confrontation with the Soviet Union. When we moved to Hubei Province, many people were assigned there to work on an oil field that used to be a swamp. In Sichuan, I was in one of the most populous cities in the world and the most important memories were of all the itinerant peasant workers from Chongqing. Then, in 1993, the huge urbanization strive in Beijing also impacted my art. All of these experiences have given me a lot of inspiration.\\"  Career  He began his career as an oil painter, then moved on to photography. He considers himself both a journalist and an artist, saying, \\"I think it is very meaningless if an artist only creates art for art's sake. For me, the dramatic changes in China have transformed China into a huge playground or construction site.

Directly inspired by Go, and referred to as \\"Go on speed,\\" by its creator it is played on a 19x19 grid of lines. It differs from Go by using a move protocol from Symple, another of Christian Freeling's games, and \\"othelloanian capture\\" where stones change colors when captured instead of being removed from the board. The goal of Sygo is to control the most territory on the board as determined by the number of a player's stones on the board as well as the empty points completely surrounded by the players stones. The game ends when one player either resigns or both players pass on successive turns. Christian Freeling considers it one of his six most important games, along with Dameo, Emergo, Grand Chess, Storisende, and Symple  Rules = Movement  Each player has one of two color stones, black or white. The game set up starts with an empty board. Each turn a player may either: # Grow all of their groups of stones or... # Put a stone on a vacant cell unconnected to any other friendly group. A group is defined as any one or more stones connected orthogonally (up, down, left, or right) with no spaces in between. Groups are grown by placing a single stone orthogonally adjacent to any stone within a group. If a stone connects two or more different groups during a growth phase both groups are considered to have been grow by the single stone. Each group may only grow by one stone per turn. If two groups grow so that each of the two new stones touch to unite the two groups into one group, then the move is legal and does not count as growing a group twice in one turn. White moves first. In order to mitigate any turn order advantage, if neither player has grown their groups, Black may grow all of his groups and place a single stone on any vacant square on the same turn. Moving is not compulsory and a player may pass his turn at any time.  Capture  Each stone or group has what are called liberties. A liberty is a vacant point orthogonally adjacent to a stone. When a stone or group loses all its liberties by being \\"surrounded\\" by an opponent's stones, all the stones in that group are captured. In Sygo, capturing a stone means reversing their color and making them the capturing player's own rather than removing them from the board. If the placement of a stone results in the player's own group losing all its liberties then the move is referred to as \\"suicide\\" and is illegal. Another move must be chosen or the player must pass their turn. Because of Sygo's \\"othelloian\\" capture protocol, common gameplay elements found in Go, such as Ko and snap-back, are not possible.  Scoring  When one player resigns, or both players pass their turns successively, Sygo ends and the game is scored. A player's score is determined by the number of their stones on the board as well as the vacant points entirely surrounded by their stones. Sygo is a cycle free variant of Go and as such doesn't require Komi to compensate for a second player disadvantage as in Go.  Trivia  * Sygo can be played online against the AiAi program. * In the process of inventing Symple, Freeling considered it initially \\"flawed\\" because of a problem with drawing that was pointed out by Luis Bola√±os Mures, now fixed. Ironically, Sygo was \\"simple\\" to invent in comparison, because its rules fell together quicker and more simply, by just adding the symple move protocol and othelloanian capture to Go. * Because of the Move Protocol, Sygo is a faster game than Go. * Sygo has a game complexity of ~ 10^540.45, greater than Chess, Shogi, Xiangqi, and Go.

The thirteenth tropical cyclone, twelfth named storm, fourth hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Laura originated from a large tropical wave that moved off the West African coast on August 16. The tropical wave gradually organized, becoming a tropical depression on August 20\\\\. Though in only a marginally conducive environment for intensification, the depression nevertheless intensified into a tropical storm a day later, becoming the earliest twelfth named storm on record in the North Atlantic basin, forming eight days earlier than 1995's Hurricane Luis. The depression received the name Laura and tracked west-northwest towards the Lesser Antilles. Laura first hit the Lesser Antilles and brushed Puerto Rico as a tropical storm, before it moved across the island of Hispaniola. The storm killed 21 people in Haiti and four in the Dominican Republic. The storm later moved across the length of Cuba, while maintaining its intensity as convection was mainly to the south of the island, although its outer rainbands extended into the Florida Keys and South Florida. Laura moved across the Gulf of Mexico, strengthening slowly at first, before a period of rapid intensification began on August 26\\\\. That day, Laura became a major hurricane, and later attained peak winds of 150 mph (240 km/h), making it a strong Category 4 hurricane, with its pressure bottoming out at . Early on August 27, Laura made landfall near peak intensity on Cameron, Louisiana with winds, with a minimum central pressure of . It quickly weakened over land, degrading to a tropical storm over Northwestern Louisiana before dropping to tropical depression status near Pine Bluff, Arkansas on August 28\\\\. It turned eastward and became a remnant low over Kentucky on August 29 before being absorbed by an extratropical low over Maryland several hours later. Origins and early development Laura shortly after being named on August 21\\\\. On August 16, a large tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa. The same day, the National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of tropical development as the wave neared more favorable conditions, with the 5-day development chance being estimated at 20%. The next day, the wave entered more favorable developmental conditions and the NHC raised the 5-day development chance to 50%. It then merged with another disturbance to its west and a low- pressure area formed, prompting the NHC to raise the 5-day development potential to 90% and dubbing the disturbance Invest 98L. The low continued to slowly organize with rainbands apparent and a well-defined low-level center forming. Eventually, the NHC determined that the low had organized enough to be declared a tropical cyclone and began issuing advisories on Tropical Depression Thirteen at 03:00 UTC on August 20\\\\. At the time, it was located around 1035 miles (1670 km) east-southeast of the Northern Leeward Islands. The Bermuda High over the Central Atlantic built westward, which in turned steered the system west-northwestward. The system would be steered around this ridge for its entire existence. Environmental conditions featured mixed signals for intensification, including low wind shear and dry air from the Saharan Air Layer. Accordingly forecast models displayed solutions ranging from the system degrading back into a tropical wave all the way to becoming a major hurricane within the next five days. Radar image showing Tropical Storm Laura making landfall in Puerto Rico on August 21. Initial aircraft reconnaissance into the system late on August 20 into August 21 revealed a poorly organized system with an ill-defined, elongated surface low. Furthermore, the system's mid-level circulation was displaced several hundred miles southeast of the assumed surface circulation. Throughout the early part of August 21, the depression may have degenerated into a tropical wave. The depression continued to struggle because of significant mid-level wind shear, dry air, and its fast forward motion of over . However, a Hurricane Hunters flight on August 21 observed gale-force winds and a center farther south then previously estimated. Consequently, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and named it Laura at 13:05 UTC. Laura became the earliest twelfth named Atlantic storm ever recorded, beating the record of Hurricane Luis of 1995 by eight days. At the time, Laura was located around 230 miles (375 km) east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands. Despite being stronger, Laura remained poorly organized due to moderate wind shear as it moved over the Leeward Islands, with most of its convection and strongest winds located north and east of the center of circulation. During the afternoon of August 22, a strong mesocyclone within the storm's broader circulation impacted Puerto Rico; sustained winds associated with this feature reached in Las Mar√≠as, although this was not representative of the storm's actual intensity. Eventually, Laura became slightly better organized and it strengthened a little as it passed south of Puerto Rico, although its center remained elongated. Laura then made landfall near San Pedro de Macor√≠s, Dominican Republic at around 03:00 UTC on August 23 with 1-minute sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a pressure of 1003 mbars (29.62 inHg). Trek through the Greater Antilles Hurricane Marco (left) on August 23. Despite moving over rugged, mountainous terrain, normally an impediment to tropical cyclone organization, the large size of Laura allowed it to maintain most of its intensity as it moved over Hispaniola and the overall structure of the storm actually improved with expanding upper-level outflow and intense convection over the Barahona Peninsula. Continuing to move west-northwestward around the southern side of the Bermuda High building westward over the Southeastern U.S., Laura moved back over water in the Windward Passage and strengthened some before making landfall in Eastern Cuba with 60 mph (95 km/h) winds and a 1000 mbar (29.53 inHg) pressure at 00:00 UTC on August 24. Laura structure continued to improve even though it was over land and winds maxed out at 65 mph (100 km/h) at 03:00 UTC. However, most of its convection was located south of the center due to wind shear. Continuing to trek west- northwestward, Laura moved back over the Caribbean Sea just south of the coast of Cuba after being over land for six hours. A period of dry air entertainment coupled with the continued effects of moderate northerly shear and land interaction briefly degraded and weakened the storm as it struggled to remain organized throughout August 24 due to the lack of a defined inner-core with the most intense accompanying convection in a prominent band south of the circulation center. However, this turned out to be short-lived as Laura reorganized and restrengthened over the warm waters of the Caribbean before making landfall on the western tip of Cuba in Pinar del Rio province at around 00:00 UTC on August 25\\\\. At the time, it had 65 mph (105 km/h) winds and a 998 mbar (29.47 inch) pressure. Gulf of Mexico, rapid intensification and landfall Hurricane Laura rapidly intensifying in the Gulf of Mexico on August 26\\\\. After clearing Cuba, Laura quickly began to gain more organization as it moved west-northwestward into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The organization was accompanied by steady strengthening, and Laura was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane at 12:15 UTC on August 25 after hurricane hunters found hurricane-force winds at the surface. Laura then developed an inner core and a central dense overcast (CDO), although it still had a somewhat ragged appearance on satellite imagery. Its intensification continued to be slow due to the presence of some dry air and light northerly wind shear, but this eventually subsided, allowing Laura to become more organized and form a banding-type cloud-filled eye late on August 25. With no more negative factors hindering strengthening and sea surface temperatures around 30 ¬∞C, Laura began to rapidly intensify, becoming a Category 2 at 06:00 UTC on August 26 before achieving Category 3 status just six hours later, making it the first major hurricane of the season. By this time, Laura was beginning to make a gradual northward turn around the high-pressure ridge in front of a mid-to-upper-level trough over Texas and the Southern Great Plains. Laura rapidly strengthening before landfall, then rapidly weakening after landfall As the day progressed, Laura's eye continued to clear out and the deep convection around it intensified and became more symmetric. The satellite presentation continued to improve with the eye becoming better defined, and cloud tops colder than -70 ¬∞C in the surrounding ring of deep convection in the developing eyewall. Laura continued to rapidly strengthen that afternoon and reached Category 4 intensity at 18:00 UTC. The hurricane's eye reached a diameter of 30 mi (45 km) that evening and aircraft reconnaissance indicated it to have acquired sustained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) by 21:00 UTC; this represented an increase of 65 mph (100 km/h) over a 24-hour period. Laura's structure continued to improve with a very distinct, 25 nautical-mile-wide eye embedded in a symmetric central dense overcast and upper-level outflow becoming well established in all quadrants of the cyclone. As it turned north-northwestward towards the Louisiana coastline, Laura reached its peak intensity at 01:00 UTC on August 27 as a high-end Category 4 hurricane with 1-minute sustained winds 150 mph (240 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 937 mbar (hPa; 27.67 inHg), as measured by reconnaissance aircraft. At this point, the hurricane was located south of Lake Charles, Louisiana and south-southeast of Port Arthur, Texas by a distance of 95 miles (155 km) each. Two hours after reaching its peak intensity, Laura began to experience some shear from the trough to its west, finally halting it intensification phase. The outflow became restricted on its west side and its pressure began to fluctuate. However, Laura continued to have very impressive appearance on satellite imagery. Turning almost due north, Laura made its final landfall near Cameron, Louisiana at 06:00 UTC with 150 mph (240 km/h) winds and a pressure of 938 mbars (27.70 inches). The wind speed made Laura the first Category 4 hurricane to ever hit southwestern Louisiana as well as the strongest hurricane to hit the state since the 1856 Last Island hurricane. Forecasters at the NHC described the system as \\"a ferocious looking hurricane with a clear circular eye, an intense eyewall, and tightly-coiled surrounding spiral bands.\\" Demise Laura moving over Northwestern Louisiana an hour after being downgraded to a tropical storm on August 27\\\\. After landfall, Laura continued to move northward through the western side of Louisiana. It passed just west of Lake Charles, Louisiana while still a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds at the Lake Charles Regional Airport reaching with gusts up to . Despite this, Laura was already beginning to quickly weaken and its winds dropped to Category 3 intensity halfway between De Quincy and Oretta at 09:00 UTC before weakening to below major hurricane strength north of Singer just an hour later. Steadily turning more northeastward, Laura dropped to Category 1 status south of Natchitoches, Louisiana at 14:00 UTC as its eye filled and its satellite and radar appearance degraded. It weakened further to a tropical storm north of Arcadia at 17:00 UTC before moving into Southern Arkansas, where wind gusts in the state reached nearly 60 mph (95 km/h). Convection around the storm center weakened further as the storm passed just east of Little Rock. Laura was downgraded to a tropical depression shortly after that at 03:00 UTC on August 28 and the responsibilities for issuing advisories on the storm was handed off to the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) since there was still a flood threat. Laura then accelerated as it turned northeastward and then east-northeastward as it began to lose tropical characteristics ahead of an approaching trough from the west. It moved through Southeastern Missouri and turned eastward into Kentucky before becoming over remnant low in Head of Grassy at 09:00 UTC on August 29 and the WPC issued its final advisory as the flood threat was generally over. The low continued eastward through West Virginia and Extreme Northern Virginia before being absorbed by an approaching extratropical system over Maryland several hours later.

He was a bronze specialist and a collaborator of Gian Lorenzo Bernini. In 1658 he was named the latter's assistant. Verpoorten was born in Flanders in the early 17th century. In Flanders, he was reportedly active in Mechelen. He then moved to Rome, probably around 1656. In Rome, Verpoorten became associated with Gian Lorenzo Bernini and his circle. Between 1658 and 1659 he collaborated with Bernini and Gioacchino Francesco Travani on the Medallion of Androclus and the Lion (designed by Bernini), probably making the first clay model. In fact, in October 1658 a payment to \\"mons√π Pietro Verpetren\\" (his name was often misspelled) \\"a bon conto delle cose che fa per servitio della Medaglia con il ritratto di N.S.r Ales.ro 7\\" was issued. Another payment, likely with respect to his work on the medallion, was issued to Verpoorten in August 1658. Finally, in 1659 Verpoorten received a third payment \\"a conto de' modelli\\". Verpoorten was a collaborator of Bernini, working with him, for example, on the Chair of St. Peter in St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. In 1658, Verpoorten was appointed assistant to Bernini, as a specialist in bronze casting. His best known work in collaboration with Bernini is the eternal lamp of the Chigi Chapel in the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo. This bronze sanctuary lamp (which forms a gilded crown hanging on chains, decorated with the eight-pointed stars of the Chigi and supported by three flying cherubs) was modeled by Verpoorten for Bernini.

She was educated at Marie Souvestre's Allenswood Boarding Academy together with her sisters, Ida and Ethel. In 1914 her father died after being paralysed from a stroke for seven years. She and Ida had given up their own aspirations and social life to care for him. This may have been the reason they did not marry. He left ¬£20,000 to each of his daughters and she decided to buy a house with her sister Ida. They bought the \\"Bury House\\" (now Grade two listed) in Odiham which dated from the 1600s and had good transport links to London. At the new house at Christmas 1914 they began to plan new works. Hilda was to get involved with creating parcels to go to prisoners of war. At the end of the war some women were given the vote. Hilda became involved with Women's Institutes where women could gather and discuss issues of importance. She used her W.I. influence to help a woman (her sister Ida) to get elected to Hampshire County Council. In 1935 she became the organisations national treasurer. She and her sister were well informed. Their brothers Austen and Neville Chamberlain held all the major positions in the British government and both of them would send regular and informative letters. At one time they were both in the cabinet. She and Ida were concerned about the military threat posed by Hitler's rise to power in Germany and they tried to influence Neville as Prime Minister. In 1939 war broke out and Neville soon resigned. Her sister and housemate died at \\"The Bury\\" in Odiham in 1943. She survived her and died in her nineties, also at home in Odiham, in 1967.

Helsinki (1995).  Biography  Carmen Selves was born in Manresa. Specialized in portrait and oil painting, being pianist, she enter the Reial Acad√®mia Catalana de Belles Arts de Sant Jordi in Barcelona 1952, where she obtains her diplom in 1955. Her first oil paintings was done when she was 9 years old, no doubt she was influenced by her mother who possessed artistic gifts. Daughter of Joan Selvas i Carner and Carmen Baltierrez i Clotet, she lived the post-war period at the start of her career, being completely outside any political orientation but suffering from the consequences of the situation. When she was only 14 years old, she painted a rural landscape of Castelltallat range; she received a special mention in a painting competition of the parish of Sant Josep de Manresa and was recognized as a talented painter by the critic Ferran Hurtado Sanchis. This pushes her to study painting not only in Manresa, being an active painter of the Artistic Circle of Manresa, but also in Barcelona. Rambla dels artistes (2010). At the School of Sant Jordi, she had as teachers renowned painters such as Francisco Ribera G√≥mez, Josep Puigdengolas Barella or Ernest Santasusagna i Santacreu. But the greatest influence, leaving aside the classics which she knows very well, she received from her tutor after the completion of her studies, that of Evarist Basiana i Arbiell and his unique theory of the color that is applied in some of the jungle paintings. Much later, in 1992, for her personal interest and also to meet the academic requirements of the baccalaureate, she wrote a dissertation on the painter Llu√Øsa Vidal. In 1979, she obtained a diploma in archeology at the University of Barcelona. She also worked at Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya.  Private life  Costa Brava, Platja d'Aro (1985). Married to Josep Maria Vicente Esforzado, she had 4 children and many obligations which made her presence in the world of exhibitions, between 1957 and 1994 approximately, more rare.  Evolution of works style  First a portrait painter, in her first stage, she has a style halfway between expressionism figurative and impressionism. Then her portrait and her vision are more symbolists and she always uses other techniques besides oil painting: murals, ceramics, acrylics and others. She participates graphically and in other forms (scripts, voice, directing, production, etc.) in the creation of computerized animations in an unusual style and even does a video game whenever the themes provide a message. clearly positive. She also practices the themes of landscapes, marine and rural or simply floral and animal, uses urban themes and still life. She illustrates interactive children's books of which she herself publishes limited editions.  Exhibitions  As it can be readen in her CV, she has exhibited in Finland, Spain, France, Italy, Japan, and the United States among others. * 2015 : Museum Gustavo de Maeztu of Estrella * 2018 : Galeria ESART  References  External links  * * Artisspectrum #33 pag 49 * Participation in 2014 in Reconstructing Reality * Participation in 2015 in the exhibition Figuraciones in the Museum Gustavo de Maeztu * Record in Cuadros de una Exposici√≥n * La Spadarina (Piacenza / Italia) 2018 * ArtQuest * Cercle Art√≠stic de Manresa * Carmen Selves at 20 century * Spotlight Magazine 8 * Spotlight Magazine 12 * Artistes del Bages - Museu de Manresa Category:Catalan painters Category:Contemporary artists Category:People from Manresa Category:Living people ","title":"Carmen Selves"},{"id":"65137944","text":"Sigma Phi Sigma (Œ£Œ¶Œ£) was a national collegiate fraternity founded in 1908 at the University of Pennsylvania. It ceased operations during WWII and was unable to restart as a national entity, with several chapters joining other fraternities, predominantly Phi Sigma Kappa. History Sigma Phi Sigma was founded as a social, academic fraternity at the University of Pennsylvania on 13 April, 1908.Date noted in the Feb 14, 1935 edition of The Maine Campus, p.4, accessed 28 Aug, 2020. The Founders were: *Brice Hayden Long *Percy Hollinshed Wood *Guy Park Needham From the start, leaders cited an early aspiration of national expansion. Efforts were concentrated on formation of chapters at larger institutions, mostly state universities or large private schools. Some of these chapters entered into successful building projects. By the early 1930s it had achieved a chapter roll of eighteen, what appears to be its high water mark, but there were rumblings that this was insufficient to support its national functions during the Great Depression and WWII. Just four of its chapters re-opened after the war, and due to the fraternity's inability to re-ignite operations elsewhere, the majority of these, and scattered alumni from other chapters, sought new national allegiances. Demise The Sigma Phi Sigma house at Oregon State, 1923 The Fraternity's disintegration began as early as 1941, when the University of Maryland chapter withdrew to become a chapter of Sigma Chi. Cornell's chapter closed that same year, with most of its members joining Tau Kappa Epsilon. The fraternity formally voted for dissolution at its 21st and last grand assembly in January, 1947. Immediately after the vote to dissolve in 1947, the University of California chapter merged into the re-established Phi Sigma Kappa chapter on that campus, with the provision that any other member of Sigma Phi Sigma from other chapters might also join Phi Sigma Kappa.According to the article, the fine relationship PSK enjoyed with SPS at its dissolution was spurred by \\"notably excellent relations with PSK's Bro. Dean Palm and Bro. Bill Wood.\\" Following their lead, most of the brothers from the former University of Nevada and University of Wisconsin chapters similarly sought safe harbor in Phi Sigma Kappa, and participated in restoring those chapters as they rebuilt operations. Phi Sigma Kappa's Wisconsin chapter had been dormant since 1931, thus the infusion of new members coming from Sigma Phi Sigma was able to re- start that chapter. The University of Oregon chapter became a unit of Phi Kappa Psi, and the University of Illinois chapter merged operations with Tau Kappa Epsilon there. Finally, one chapter, at Penn State University, lingered as an independent local for several years, retaining the name Sigma Phi Sigma. In 1954 it chartered as a chapter of Theta Delta Chi. The 1991 edition of Baird's Manual noted the Society had 4,500 initiates. Chapters The Society had established chapters at eighteen schools, including: *1908 - Alpha - University of PennsylvaniaAccording to the 1930 Record yearbook, p.327 (of the digital file) the chapter was located at 3914 Spruce St., in Philadelphia, PA. Accessed 28 Aug 2020. *1919 - Beta - Penn State UniversityBaird's notes cryptically that this chapter continued as a local unit for a short time after 1947.However, the surviving chapter explains more fully in their online history, what transpired. They begun as a local, with an architectural focus, called Iota Chi Delta on 13 Mar, 1915, soon expanding to include landscape architecture and civil engineering students. They sought a national affiliation, sending letters to several fraternities. This resulted in installation as the Beta chapter of Sigma Phi Sigma on 24 May 1919, (apparently out of alphabetical sequence with the other chapters, but this is quoted directly). After WWII the chapter reactivated with 8 returning brothers moving back into their solid building, which became the last chapter standing of their national, and a defacto local. In 1952 the group sought out a new national affiliation, finding Theta Delta Chi. They were installed as the Sigma Triton charge of that fraternity on 22 May, 1954.The Penn State H.O. Smith Botanic Gardens and Arboretum was established to honor an early member of the chapter in a gift from his son. Accessed 28 Aug 2020. See The Arboretum at Penn State.National fraternity Theta Delta Chi in a website post clarifies that this chapter, operating as a local, became their Sigma Triton chapter in 1954.

Most of the building except for the extension was destroyed by a fire in 1921, and was replaced by a building which was until 2009 a Woolworths shop. The second one dated from 1900, in a building constructed using money left in the will of George Charles Benn, who in his will of 1895 left ¬£6,000 to the local council to construct a building that would be useful to the town. It was constructed on the site of the former ‚ÄòShoulder of Mutton Inn‚Äô. It was used by the council until 1937, when they moved to an early 19th century property known as \\"The Lawn\\" on Newbold Road, and the second town hall was converted into a Marks and Spencer shop, which it remained until 2015. After civic leaders found that the \\"The Lawn\\" was inadequate for their needs, they elected to construct a purpose-built facility. The current building, the third town hall, was built between 1959 and 1961. Adjoining it to the north is a functions venue called Benn Hall which was built at the same time. The Town Hall and Benn Hall were both formally opened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother on 5 July 1961. It was designed by J.C. Prestwich & Sons, and consists of two brick neo-Georgian wings, fronted by a white stone entrance portico, the top of which is inscribed with the borough motto \\"Floreat Rugbeia\\", Latin for \\"May Rugby Flourish\\". The architecture historian Nikolaus Pevsner did not hold a favourable view of the town hall, describing it as \\"quite dead architecturally\\".Rugby, Further Aspects of The Past, Rugby Local History Group (1977) page 82 During 1984-85 the town hall made the national news when it was the scene of protests against Rugby council's controversial decision to remove the words ‚Äòsexual orientation‚Äô from their Equal Opportunities policy. This was widely interpreted as a 'ban on gays' and caused uproar, and led to large protests from gay rights campaigners and politicians, including the MP Chris Smith, who used the occasion to choose to \\"come out\\" as Britain's first gay MP. The council eventually bowed to pressure to reverse the decision in early 1985. A bronze sculpture commemorating Sir Frank Whittle, the \\"Father of the Jet Engine\\", was installed at Chestnut Field just outside the town hall in 2005. In more recent times solar panels were installed on the roof of the building.

The murders occurred on two of the family's estates in Azul, Argentina in April 1922.  Murders  Although the family was originally from Chascom√∫s by 1922 they owned two cattle ranches on the outskirts of Azul, referred to as el \\"Tr√©bol\\" y la \\"Buena Suerte.\\" While Mateo Banks lived away from the ranches in the city, on the afternoon of April 18 he traveled to la Buena Suerte where his brother Dionisio was staying with his daughter Sara (Sarita). After killing his brother with a Winchester rifle he then beat Sara with the rifle and threw her down a well. He then fired into the well, killing her. When one of the ranch's peons, Juan Gait√°n, arrived he was also gunned down. Banks then traveled five kilometers to el Tr√©bol where he encountered another laborer named Claudio Loiza. After convincing Loiza that Dionisio was sick and needed aid, they began traveling back to la Buena Suerte. Partway between the ranches Banks shot Loiza to death and hid his body. Traveling back to el Tr√©bol Banks spent the rest of the day with those staying there; namely his sister Mar√≠a Ana, his brother Miguel, Miguel's wife Julia, Gait√°n's daughter Mar√≠a Ercilia, and Dionisio's other daughters Cecilia and Anita. At night he awoke his sister, convinced her to come to la Buena Suerte to check on Dionisio, and killed her along the way. He returned to el Tr√©bol, woke up Miguel, Julia, and fifteen-year-old Cecilia and shot them each to death. He left five-year-old Anita and four-year-old Mar√≠a Ercilia alive and locked in a room.  Banks' story  According to Banks he came upon Gait√°n and Loiza after they had attacked his family. Banks then shot Gaitan and wounded Loiza, who shot Banks in the foot. This \\"bullet hole\\" in his boot was later revealed to have been made with an awl. He claimed he then spent time with Miguel as he lay dying, though the autopsy showed that Miguel had died instantly. Eventually, the prosecution tied Banks to the purchase of the ammunition and to an attempted poisoning of his family earlier on the day of the crime. He also confessed at one point, but later claimed it was through torture by the authorities.  Motive  In the course of the investigation it was revealed that Banks had lost his fortune and was on the verge of destitution, even after having sold part of his inheritance to his siblings. He had also sold large amounts of cattle that didn't belong to him after forging Dionisio's signature. The prosecutor concluded that Banks wanted to a) conceal his past crimes from the family and b) inherit the fortunes of both Mar√≠a Ana and Miguel. He couldn't attain Dionisio's fortune due to Dionisio's wife still being alive and away in a mental institution. This (in addition to her youth making her an unreliable witness) explains why Anita was not killed. Since Dionisio would still have an heir (his wife) it was not profitable. Banks also spared Mar√≠a Ercilia because her death would have contradicted his story that her father was one of the perpetrators.  Trial and later life  Banks had two trials, both of which ended with a sentence of life imprisonment. At the second trial famed lawyer Antonio Palacios Zinny tried to garner sympathy with the jury by having Banks poison himself in front of them with a (non-fatal) dose of cyanide. Banks wouldn't go through with it. Despite being sentenced to life in prison he was released in 1949. He moved to Buenos Aires under an assumed name and died later that year at the age of 77.

Its activity is divided into four main areas: services for telecommunications infrastructures; audiovisual broadcasting networks; security and emergency network services; and solutions for the intelligent management of urban infrastructures and services (smart cities and Internet of things). Franco Bernab√® is the president of Cellnex Telecom after assuming the presidency of the company on July 25, 2019. Tob√≠as Mart√≠nez, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and head of the company since November 2014, temporarily assumed the presidency of the company in February 2018 after the resignation of Francisco Reyn√©s, who left office after being appointed CEO of Gas Natural Fenosa. The company's legal headquarters have been located at the offices on Calle Juan Esplandi√∫ in Madrid since October 2017 due to the 2017‚Äì2018 Spanish constitutional crisis. However, the majority of their employees remain in Barcelona and the board of directors has not ruled out returning the legal headquarters to Barcelona. Cellnex Telecom had revenues of 901 million euros in 2018 and an EBITDA of 591 million. At the end of 2018, there was 1437 employees. Cellnex Telecom is listed on the market of the Bolsa de Madrid and is part of the IBEX35. It is also part of the sustainability indices FTSE4GOOD, CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) and Standard Ethics.  History  In 2000, Acesa Telecom (later Abertis Telecom) acquired 52% of Tradia and merged into Abertis Telecom (now Cellnex Telecom). Three years later, after Auna was spun-off, Retevisi√≥n's audiovisual business became part of Abertis Telecom. In 2005, the deployment of Digital Terrestrial Television began in Spain, with a network that reached 80% population coverage carrying out the first tests in Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Zaragoza and Gij√≥n. In 2006, the company was awarded the contract by which it became the operator of DTT signals for Spanish broadcasters with national coverage. In 2010, the ‚ÄúAnalogue Blackout‚Äù occurred in Spain, after the complete digitization of Abertis Telecom network of centers. Between 2012 and 2013, the company acquired more than 2,500 telecommunication towers from Telef√≥nica and Yoigo, and laid the foundations for its future position as a neutral operator. In 2014, it acquired TowerCo, an Italian telecommunications operator, which manages the mobile phone towers located in the entire motorway network of Italy, thus initiating the process of internationalization. That same year it deployed the first Internet of Things (IoT) network in Spain with Sigfox technology.  IPO  Cellnex Telecom is the name which the company Abertis Telecom was renamed to prepare for its IPO. The company, a subsidiary of the Abertis company, officially changed its name on April 1, 2015, after being approved at the shareholders' meeting that took place on March 23, 2015.https://www.cellnextelecom.com/content/uploads/2017/02/Cellnex-Estados- Financieros-Consolidados-20161.pdf On April 24, it was made public that the company would debut on the stock market on May 7 of the same year, at a price that would range between 12 and 14 euros per share, estimating a market capitalization between 2.8 and 3.2 billion euros. With the IPO of Cellnex Telecom, Abertis fulfilled one of the main objectives of the Strategic Plan 2015-2017, with which it intended to value its telecommunications business and obtain resources to invest in growth and international expansion of its highway division. The telecommunications subsidiary of Abertis marked its first crossing at 15.5 euros at the ringing of the bell that took place at 11 a.m. on May 6, 2015 on the Madrid Stock Exchange. The company's shares rose more than 10% in its first session, to 15.41 euros. Subsequently, its price fell slightly from those 15.5 euros. Cellnex marked an intraday minimum of 15 euros and a maximum of 15,695 euros.  Joining the IBEX 35  The IBEX 35 Technical Advisory Committee, after the first ordinary review of the committee on Thursday, June 9, 2016, announced the departure of Sacyr and OHL from the index and its replacement by Cellnex Telecom and Viscofan. These changes happened on June 20, 2016. The index was adjusted at the close of the session on June 17.

Cellnex Telecom is specialized in the deployment of networks prepared for 5G technology because of its presence in Europe, with nearly 53,000 sites - including small cells and Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) - in seven European countries: Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Ireland.  Cellnex Spain  Cellnex Telecom has a network of telecommunications infrastructures in Spain of 8,832 operating sites distributed throughout the territory, which provide wide geographical coverage and allow it to offer services to mobile operators, broadcasters and administrations.

Cellnex Italy  Cellnex is the leading independent wireless telecommunications infrastructure operator in Italy. The 10,000 sites that Cellnex operates in Italy through its subsidiaries Galata and Towerco constitute one of the densest and most capillary networks that cover the entire Italian territory, positioning the company in a privileged situation to accompany the rapid deployment of new generation networks. CommsCon (another subsidiary) manages an additional 1,500 DAS nodes. Both Galata, Towerco and CommsCon, the companies through which Cellnex operates in Italy, work under the multi-operator and multi-service concept.

Cellnex France  Cellnex France was created in July 2016 after reaching an acquisition agreement with Bouygues Telecom. The agreement with the company, which includes the usage of sites until 2022, was renewed in February 2017 and December 2018 and has given Cellnex the means to be a significant operator in the service provision segment in the short term of infrastructures to French telecommunications operators. In addition, in May 2019, the company announced a new agreement with Iliad France with which it will manage the sites that are currently integrated into Free, a French voice and data operator. In total, Cellnex has a network of 13,750 sites in France.  Cellnex Netherlands  Cellnex Telecom acquired Towerlink Netherlands B.V., Shere Masten B.V. in 2016 and Alticom B.V. in 2017. The three companies have more than 918 telecommunications sites for the distribution of mobile data communication and telecommunications. The main customers interested in telecom infrastructure services are the Dutch mobile network operators KPN, Vodafone, T-Mobile and Tele2. The sites are distributed throughout the country and are managed from their central Reeuwijk office.  Cellnex UK  Cellnex acquired the telecommunications division of the Arqiva group in the United Kingdom, adding 8,300 locations to Cellnex in the British market. The agreement follows the announcement in June of a long-term strategic alliance with BT, through which Cellnex obtained the rights to commercialize and operate 220 high-rise towers distributed throughout the United Kingdom. This alliance entails the acquisition of around 7,400 owned sites and the marketing rights for an additional 900 sites spread throughout the UK. Cellnex thus became the main independent operator of wireless telecommunications infrastructures in the United Kingdom. The agreement also includes concessions for the use of street furniture for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure in 14 boroughs of London.  Cellnex Switzerland  Following the agreement with Salt in May 2019, Cellnex manages a portfolio of more than 6,000 sites and is permanently consolidated in Switzerland.  Cellnex Ireland  In September 2019, Cellnex reached an agreement with InfraVia Capital Partners for the acquisition of the Irish telecommunications tower and site operator Cignal. The company currently operates 546 sites in Ireland, making it the seventh country in which Cellnex operates in Europe.

This was a prelude to being incorporated, along with three other squadrons, into Groupe de Combat 13 the next day, 1 October. From 5 December 1917 to 15 January 1918, Escadrille Spa.88 was detached from the Groupe. After rejoining Groupe de Combat 13, the Groupe was one of those incorporated into Escadre de Combat No. 2 on 26 February. In turn, the Escadre was gathered into the Division Aerienne on 14 May 1918, as part of the French accretion of airpower. The Division Aerienne was tasked to the U.S. 1st Army for the Battle of Saint-Mihiel. On 10 September, as part of Groupe de Combat 13, the squadron was again Mentioned in dispatches. By war's end, Escadrille Spa.88 was credited with destroying 32 German airplanes and four observation balloons.

It is a trick-taking game for two or more players and features the four Jacks as top trumps.  Name  The name Knektpass literally means \\"Knight Pass\\" and clearly refers to the four 'Knights' which have been promoted to top trumps, a feature that does not appear in any other variants of Rams. The word pass can mean pass in the sense of a permit or a mountain pass and probably refers to the privilege of the Knights in being able to pass unscathed through a trick, unable to be beaten by the other lesser cards.  Cards  A 36-card pack of the French-suited, 'Modern Swedish' pattern is used. The honours or permanent trumps are the four 'knights': J, J, J and J which rank in that order. They are followed by the cards of the trump suit from Ace down to Six, with the exception of the Jack. The plain suits rank in their natural order: A > K > Q > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7 > 6. If more than three play, a 52-card pack is used.  Rules  The following rules are based on those in the Ny och fullst√§ndig svensk spelbok of 1847.  Preliminaries  Players start the game with an agreed number of points each, typically 12, which is chalked on a slate or pencilled on a scoresheet. The aim of the game is to be the first player to reach 0 points by taking tricks. Each trick won earns a one-point deduction from the starting total of 12 points.  Deal and exchange  At the start of the game players cut for the deal; the player with the lowest card deals, shuffles the pack, offers it to his right for cutting and then deals 5 cards each to the left in packets of 2 and then 3, before turning the next card for trumps. Thereafter, the deal rotates to the left. The dealer may exchange with the trump turnup. Forehand (left of the dealer) then announces whether he will play or fold (i.e. drop out of the current deal), followed by the other players in clockwise order. In the same order, those who elect to play may then discard any number of hand cards in return for the same number of cards from the talon. There may be up to three rounds of exchanging. If all fold, the cards are redealt. If only one plays, he wins immediately and deducts 5 points from his score; the others keeping their current scores.  Play  At least 2 players must elect to play for the deal to proceed. The player in forehand leads. Players must follow suit and overtake if possible.  Scoring  A player must take at least as many tricks as they exchanged cards. If they succeed, they deduct 1 point per trick taken. If they fail, they add 5 points multiplied by the number of tricks they fell short of the minimum. For example, if a player exchanges 2 cards and takes 2 tricks they deduct 2 points. If they only take one trick, they add 5 points; if they take no tricks they add 10 points to their score. The player to reach 0 points first is the winner._ (1847).

Early life Jacobs was born in Whitechapel, London on 5 November 1932. Her parents were Bernard and Esther Rich (n√©e Bart), a furrier and milliner respectively. She studied at Dalston County secondary school in Hackney and then St Martin's School of Art, leaving school at 14. She worked initially as a secretary at a film company. However, experience of film continuity work, and particularly seeing theatre in the mid-1950s, made her return to study of stage design at the Central School of Art and Design in London. Career Jacobs commenced her career as an assistant scene painter and then began designing. She began working at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1962 and brought a very different appearance to many of their productions with her stage and costume designs. Between 1967 and 1982 she lived in the U.S. and continued to work as a designer and director for theatre and opera companies. In 1982 she returned to the UK. During her career Jacobs has designed costumes and sets for a very wide range of theatre and opera productions. She has worked with organisations including the Royal Shakespeare Company, Royal Opera House, The English National Opera, The Royal Court Theatre, Paines Plough, The Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles and Joseph Papp‚Äôs Public Theatre in New York. One of her best known set and costume designs was for the innovative production of A Midsummer Night's Dream by Peter Brook, in 1970. She was inspired by a production of the Beijing Opera to provide a blank white box as the stage and clothe the actors in brightly coloured costumes. This contributed to the lasting impact, and controversy, of this specific production. In 1984 her design for Turandot at the Royal Opera House used mirror images and colour contrasts to suggest an audience all around the performers. Jacob also taught stage design in the U.S. (including University of California Los Angeles, New York University, The Actors Studio and Rutgers University) and UK, including the Slade School of Fine Art. She was a senior lecturer in stage design at the Central School of Art and Design and was a Fellow at Goldsmiths University. Recognition and awards In 1971 she was nominated for Best Scenic Design in the 25th Tony Awards and awarded the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Set Design when the Brook A Midsummer Night's Dream was on tour in the USA. Harvard University has added her archive to the Harvard Theatre Collection at the Houghton Library. Personal life She married Alexander Jacobs (a screenwriter) in 1953. They had a son. They separated but did not divorce and he died in 1979. She was a very independent and adventurous person. She died 16 August 2020.

She was the first scientist to isolate the Herpes Zoster virus, and is one of the few African American women to receive a patent in molecular biology, for a new production method of urokinase.  Early life and education  Nicol was born in Little Rock, Kentucky. Her parents were Daniel Eugene Carmon, a schoolteacher, and Margarite Wilson Carmon, a homemaker. She was 8th of 11 children. In an interview for Lifeology, Nicol explained that despite her family having very little: \\"we used to have a lot of fun. You couldn't grow up any better than that.\\" As their local school was underfunded, and only went to eighth grade, Nicol's father took it upon himself to give the children extra homeschooling. During her high school years, Nicol worked as a domestic to earn money. When she graduated from high school, Nicol was offered a scholarship at Tuskegee University to study Home Economics. She moved to Alabama in 1949 to attend university, but she chose to study maths and chemistry instead of home economics. She funded her studies by working two jobs. She was top of her class. Nicol graduated in 1953 with a degree in Chemistry and Mathematics, and earned the Beta Kappa Chi and Alpha Kappa Mu honours.  Research and career  From 1953 to 1955, Nicol worked as a research assistant for the Salk Polio Project of the Carver Research Foundation. Under the supervision of Russel Brown, she worked on developing the first polio vaccine using HeLa cell cultures. Nicol then joined the Cleveland City Hospital, working with Frederick C. Robbins and John F. Enders. There, she was the first to successfully isolate the herpes zoster virus, which causes shingles, using amniotic cells in tissue culture. In an interview for Lifeology, Nicol said: \\"Things just come to me. I don't know why. It just seems like common sense.\\" Following these her early career successes, Nicol was headhunted by Rand Development Corporation, where she worked on isolating the Leukemia agent. During this time, Nicol also worked for the University of Kansas Medical Centre, and the Michael Reese Hospital. Nicol then joined Abbott Laboratories as a research assistant in 1962. There, she faced discrimination from her white colleagues, who would take credit for results and sabotage her work. On 6 January 1976, Nicol patented a new technique to produce urokinase (U.S. Patent No. 3,930,944), an enzyme used to dissolve blood clots. She was one of the few African American women to be awarded a patent in molecular biology. Among her many achievements while working at Abbott, Nicol successfully developed a test for toxoplasmosis in pregnant women, and an interferon assay. In 1985, Nicol was recruited by Baxter Pharmaceuticals. Within their hepatitis research and development group, known as Pandex, Nicol led the retrovirology division, which produced testing kits blood-borne diseases such as HIV. Two blind studies funded by Abbott Pharmaceuticals determined that the testing kits produced under Nicol's leadership were the best available. While at Baxter pharmaceuticals, Nicol used her seniority to combat workplace discrimination, and advocate for fairer hiring practices. For example, she hired Linda Smith, whose resume had initially been rejected, likely because she had studied at a historically Black university. While she was working there, Pandex was bought by Nicol's former employer Abbott Laboratories. Nicol retired in 1990, refusing to work for a company that had been so openly discriminatory.  Personal life  Nicol had three children as a working mother. Upon retirement, she lived in Waukegan, Illinois and later in Weston, Connecticut. At the age of 89, Nicol was hospitalised for a stroke, and was diagnosed with Covid-19. She died from complications of the infection in May 2020.
